BCHL Today is a (near) daily feature providing news and notes from around the junior A world.
Welcome to the Feb. 3, 2018 edition of BCHL Today, a (near) daily look at what's going on around the league and the junior A world.
There were seven games on the BCHL schedule, and we start in Trail, where the Langley Rivermen were whomped 8-1 at the Cominco Arena.
Rarely do you see a score like this where at least one player didn't have a multi-goal game, but the Smoke Eaters spread the scoring around with eight different players putting pucks in the net. Braedon Fleming go the start in the Langley cage, but lasted just 12:44 before getting the hook, after Trail scored twice on nine shots.
Kale Howarth and Tyler Ghirardosi did the damage.
Nic Tallarico took over in the Rivermen net and Trail took just four seconds to beat him on a Jeremy Lucchini snipe. The snowball rolled straight downhill from there. Spencer McLean and Andre Ghantous scored second period goals. A Levi Glasman goal chased Tallarico out of the net 11:40 into period three, with Fleming coming back in.
Fleming surrendered two goals on seven shots in the final 8:20, with Trail's Connor Welsh (great name!) and Braedon Tuck pulling the trigger.
Connor Marshall scored the lone goal for Langley, a team that seems to be heading south at the wrong time of year. Since coming back from the Christmas break the Rivermen have four wins against eight losses and are in danger of starting the playoffs on the road.

On the topic of disappointing teams, next up is the Chilliwack Chiefs, who fell 3-2 in Prince George Friday night.
The Spruce Kings generated just 11 shots on the Chilliwack net in this one, but were able to sneak three pucks past Chiefs stopper Mathieu Caron. Patrick Cozzi and Ben Brar had PG up 2-0 through 20 minutes. Liam Watson-Brawn had them up by three late in the second period before Corey Andonovski finally got Chilliwack on the board.
Harrison Blaisdell scored the second Chiefs goal with just 42 seconds left in the game.
I haven't talked about Chilliwack's on-ice performance much because, frankly, it's been depressing. I was hoping for so much more from a team that will host the Royal Bank Cup in just over three months. They will be playing for a national championship, and based on winning percentage they're only the 11th best team in their own league. Has there been an RBC Cup host that has turned in a weaker regular season?
Look at the Chiefs roster and it shouldn't be so. Or should it? I wonder, if head coach/general manager Jason Tatarnic could go back and construct this roster all over again, would he still entrust the net to a pair of 17 year olds? The tandem of Mathieu Caron and Daniel Chenard has been far from the only issue with this team, but they also haven't been part of any solution. Caron can be lights-out one night and shaky the next, and Chenard has been dogged by a lower body injury all season. When he's played, he's shown flashes of brilliance, but like Caron it's been an up-and-down adventure.
Having a 19 or 20 year old goalie to insulate one of the youngsters may have been a better path.
But like I said, Caron and Chenard aren't the only problem. The lineup has depth but no gamebreakers. The forward and defensive ranks are dotted with Major Junior talents (Adam Berg/Ryan Bowen/Marcus Teskink/Kyle Yewchuk/Bryan Allbee) who've underwhelmed.
Tatarnic acquired the AJHL's scoring leader, PJ Marrocco, earlier this season, and he's produced a good-but-not-great seven goals and 14 points in 17 games.
Some nights the team puts it all together and looks like the team they were supposed to be, and maybe they'll flip the switch and be that team in the playoffs. More likely, they'll be what they are now, a middling fourth-place team heading for an early exit.
————————————————————————————-
Brock Sawyer is now 0-2 as interim head coach of the Powell River Kings after his team fell 4-3 in overtime to the Alberni Valley Bulldogs Friday night.
The firing of long-time bench boss Kent Lewis seems to have thrown this team for a loop at the worst possible time, and you really have to question the timing of Lewis' dismissal by the Powell River board. The Kings loss to AV combined with Nanaimo's 8-5 win over Cowichan Valley has the Clippers even with Powell River in the Island division standings.
There's a real danger that the team could start the playoffs on the road.
Paul Selleck scored the OT winner for the Bulldogs in Friday's win, which wouldn't have gotten to extra time if Powell River's Andy Stevens hadn't come through with a game-tying goal with 1:56 left in the third period.
Darren Rizzolo, Keaton Mastrodonato and Bradley Ong also scored for the Dawgs with Carter Turnbull and Josh Coblenz replying for the Kings.
————————————————————————————-
We bounce over to that Nanaimo/Cowichan game because the score-sheet is so much fun.
Richmond native Joshua Bourne had four goals in 14 games coming into this one, where his hat-trick powered the Clips to victory. Nanaimo actually led 7-2 through two periods on Bourne's three and singles by Lucas Vanroboys, Jordan Wharrie, Brad Belisle and Preston Brodziak.
The Caps came roaring back, sort of, in the third period.
Cowichan managed eight shots on net in the final frame, and scored on three of them, with David Laroche netting a pair and Troy MacTavish adding a single.
But Nanaimo's David Melaragni countered with a power play goal at 18:22 to put any Capital comeback hopes to rest.
————————————————————————————-
Finally, to Salmon Arm where all the Silverbacks do these days is won.
Trevor Adams scored the game winner midway through period three as the BCHL's hottest team won its seventh straight game. Salmon Arm has 10 wins and a tie in 14 post-Christmas outings. They're on the verge of leap-frogging West Kelowna for fifth place in the Interior division standings, where they sit just two points back with seven games to play.
I don't know that Penticton or Vernon or Wenatchee is dreading the idea of facing the Silverbacks in the first round of the playoffs, but Salmon Arm looks like they'll be a very tough out.
Hudson Schandor had a pair of goals in Friday's win with Rhett Kingston and Brandon Whistle also scoring. R.J. Murphy had a pair of first period tallies for West K, with Parm Dhaliwal and Chase Stevenson also hitting the score-sheet.
The other two scores from Friday night saw Wenatchee take down the Coquitlam Express by a 7-3 count while the Penticton Vees squeaked out a 3-2 road win in Merritt.

A movie that's probably not on your radar but will be soon is directors Jonathan and Josh Baker's debut film, Kin. Produced by 21 Laps (they've previously brought to the screen Arrival, Kodachrome, and The Spectacular Now along with Stranger Things on Netflix), the film is a crime thriller with a sci-fi twist that stars Jack Reynor, Zoë Kravitz, Carrie Coon, Dennis Quaid, James Franco, and Myles Truitt. Here's the one-liner:
“Chased by a vengeful criminal (Franco) and a gang of otherworldly soldiers,​ a recently released ex-con (Reynor) and his adopted teenage brother (Truitt) are forced to go on the run with a weapon of mysterious origin as their only protection.”
With the movie hitting theaters August 31st, I recently got on the phone with producer Shawn Levy to talk about how the project came about and why 21 Laps wanted to produce the film. One of the things you probably know from 21 Laps' resume is they've made a few projects that blend interesting characters with cool sci-fi. I've seen the soon-to-be released trailer so trust me when I say, Kin looks to continue that trend.
During the interview Levy touched on this by saying:
“I was going to say that like Stranger Things, like Arrival, and for that matter, like our upcoming Fox movie The Darkest Minds, this is another 21 Laps project that enjoys the intersection of sci-fi and character. It seems to have become a sweet spot, certainly for our taste, and hopefully in our abilities for crafting an elevated genre character piece, and so this movie is Terminator meets No Country For Old Men, District 9 by way of True Romance.
In addition to the sci-fi angle, Levy talked about how Kin is in the vein of Amblin movies from the 80s:
“I think that to the extent that this is about a boy who is both damaged and innocent, there are shades of many Spielberg protagonists. Elliot in E.T. certainly comes to mind. The way that E.T. is about a young kid who ends up being healed by something not of this world, Eli in our movie, Kin, ends up being healed in some ways by this object that is not of this world. And frankly, even more so by the journey that he takes with Zoe Kravitz and Jack Reynor, who plays his brother. Zoe Kravitz plays a young woman who he meets along the way and joins her quest of sorts. It's both a getaway and a quest, I guess. - And it's about the kind of repair of a young kid who's a little more bruised than one should be at a young age, and so I think it's more the feeling of Amblin, that it's both dark and filled with aspiration.”
In addition, Levy talked about Jack Reynor and his love of Sing Street, how Jonathan & Josh Baker are twin brothers like Stranger Things creators the Duffer Brothers, how Hollywood has become a franchise industry, and so much more.
In addition to landing the exclusive interview with Levy, Lionsgate is also letting us premiere the first poster for Kin. Look for the trailer to be online Thursday. Until then check out what Shawn Levy had to say below.
Collider: Are you playing with fire trying to work with another pair of brother directors?
LEVY: You need a short answer? Yeah, for sure, but it's even weirder than this, my pathology is even deeper than you might've realized, because it's not just another pair of brothers, it's another set of fucking twin brothers.
That doesn't make sense.
LEVY: Yeah, so literally it's a weird coincidence, and the universe is giving me a crash course in twin director psychology, because it is really and nearly unique, and even though the Bakers and the Duffers are wildly different, there are certain similarities.
But the short backstory is, once again, you've heard this name before, Dan Cohen, my ace of a partner at 21 Laps, came across a short film a couple years ago, called Bag Man, and just as he did with the script on Stranger Things, he walked into my office, made me stop whatever I was doing, and promise I was going to love this next thing he showed me. And, in that case, it was the short film by these hot shot commercial directors, known as the Baker brothers, Josh and Jonathan Baker. I loved the short, and met with the Bakers. They had a vision for how it might be developed into a bigger world and full feature, and we linked arms and jumped into that process together.
How long ago was this?
LEVY: I think that between us watching the short film and us being on set starting principal photography of the feature was maybe a year, at most. And again, it was because the Bakers had this vision for the longer form narrative. We paired up with this amazing writer who's now written a couple of 21 Laps movies, named Dan Casey. And much like a rival, we developed this, and wrote this script, and packaged the cast all before we had the studio, and so there's an efficiency to that model that we really enjoyed on Arrival, and enjoyed similarly on Kin.
For people that don't know anything about this project, what's the story about, and what brought you to this? What made you say, “I want to produce this?”
LEVY: The story of the short, and to a large extent the feature, is this teenage African-American boy who comes from really modest means, and one day comes across this device. It might be an artifact, it might be a weapon, but it is not of our world, and it is not of our time. And it turns out that it is indeed a weapon, and in the hands of this boy it does astounding things. It has a weaponized power beyond anything we've made here on planet earth by human hands. And so the short film is literally about that. And so it's part wish fulfillment, it's got a strange kind of Amblin fantastical aspect, but what struck me about the Bakers is that their aesthetics, and their sense of tone and character were way more nuanced than most new filmmakers.
There was a command of pacing, and performance and style that felt really confident, and I just knew they were worth betting on. Once they told us the bigger story of the feature version it just confirmed that confidence, and I can tell you a bit about the premise of the feature film if you'd like, Steve?
Yeah, definitely.
LEVY: The premise is the thing, except in the feature film our lead, Eli, which is E-L-I, he is the adopted son of Dennis Quaid, who's a working-class single father, who lost his wife some years ago. And Eli has a brother, his older brother, played by Jack Reynor. Jimmy has been in prison for the last several years, and when our movie opens, it still opens with Eli finding this weapon, but it becomes this family drama, this brother's redemption story as this weapon gets Jimmy and Eli into some hot water that they did not anticipate, and they end up being on the run and on the road from some really scary dudes, both of our world and perhaps beyond.
Yeah, it's interesting-
LEVY: It's really this kind of-
No, go on, I interrupted you.
LEVY: I was going to say that like Stranger Things, like Arrival, and for that matter, like our upcoming Fox movie The Darkest Minds, this is another 21 Laps project that enjoys the intersection of sci-fi and character. It seems to have become a sweet spot, certainly for our taste, and hopefully in our abilities for crafting an elevated genre character piece, and so this movie is Terminator meets No Country For Old Men, District 9 by way of True Romance.
When you are developing something like this, because you mentioned that you were developing this before you had a studio, how much at this point are you always thinking about the bigger universe? Because it seems like every studio is looking for franchises? How much is it we just need to make a good movie, where's that line?
LEVY: Well I have to tell you we really, and this is informed by my own experience, obviously I've had experience with my mega-museum movies and more recently Stranger Things, I can sincerely tell you I don't set out to launch a franchise. I just try to make one thing really well, and if the reward is more installments and the birth of a franchise, that's awesome. And you are right, we live in a franchise-to-death industry currently, but this was as simple as a new voice and a new vision in the Baker brothers, and we wanted to back them. It was very much the same kind of uncalculated, let's be involved with talented people, the mentality that got us involved with the Duffer's, and with Ted Chiang's short story on Arrival, and most of the things that have worked out well in my career, comes from a non-mercenary non-calculated place.
So the irony here, Steve, is that if we are lucky enough to capture the attention of audiences, there is a next chapter to this story. It is just bluntly awesome and huge but we just set out to tell this story, and to adapt this short film into a feature, in a really sophisticated and hopefully provocative way.
You mentioned Amblin, obviously I grew up with these Amblin classics and the Amblin logo means a lot to mean, talk a little bit about … are they're any Amblin movies that even like resemble what you guys set out to make, or it's just Amblin-esque?
LEVY: I think it's Amblin-esque, I think that to the extent that this is about a boy who is both damaged and innocent, there are shades of many Spielberg protagonists. Elliot in E.T. certainly comes to mind. The way that E.T. is about a young kid who ends up being healed by something not of this world, Eli in our movie, Kin, ends up being healed in some ways by this object that is not of this world. And frankly, even more so by the journey that he takes with Zoe Kravitz and Jack Reynor, who plays his brother. Zoe Kravitz plays a young woman who he meets along the way and joins her quest of sorts. It's both a getaway and a quest, I guess.
And it's about the kind of repair of a young kid who's a little more bruised than one should be at a young age, and so I think it's more the feeling of Amblin, that it's both dark and filled with aspiration.
So when you guys were getting ready to make the movie, talk a little bit about the story with the budget, because no matter who you are, you always have a certain budget. Can you sort of talk about trying to make the movie with whatever budget you had, and if there were any limitations, or if this is one of those movies that it all worked out in terms of financials?
LEVY: Well that's a good question. The truth is, in general, we try to keep our movies from costing a penny more than they need to, because I take seriously the faith that someone invests when they give us money to tell our story. So I want our investors, whether it's a network or studio, to make their money back, and then some. That's really important to me.
We had a sense that this was going to be not a tiny budget, just because it is a science fiction movie with some pretty substantial visual effects and action. This was never going to be a five million dollar movie, but it also never needed to be a 40 million dollar movie. We got lucky and when we took the package out to the market, we had a bidding war among several studios who wanted to make and release the movie. It ended up at Lionsgate, with a healthy budget. I wouldn't say it was fat, by any means, but it was definitely healthy, and enough to tell this story really well.
21 Laps has been producing a lot more movies. What have you learned in the last few years producing that sort of helps us get as much of that budget on the screen?
LEVY: Well for one thing we always want to bet on ourselves, and so we're not trying to rake anyone over the coals with any upfront fees. I'd rather bet on ourselves than bet on the future. The other thing is that, honestly, one thing I've learned is that in an industry that makes fewer and fewer original films, we're proud that we are devoting ourselves to making original film. Obviously everyone loves franchises, they can be lucrative, and they can be long lasting, but whether it's Arrival, or whether it's Stranger Things, or whether Kin, we're proud of the risks that we've taken on original material, without the security blanket of branded IP, and very often with writers or directors or both who require a leap of faith. But we're willing to take that leap, if it's someone we believe in, and that was our level of certainty and trust in the Bakers.
I am a big fan of Jack Reynor. I've liked his work for a while, but Sing Street was just phenomenal. What was it that got him in the movie?
LEVY: Well, funny you should ask, and the only reason I'm doing this single interview before I get on this flight back to LA with you, is because once again we seem to be simpatico. Sing Street is possibly the favorite 21 Laps movie that we didn't make in the year it came out. We flipped Dan, Dan and I flipped for Sing Street, and Jack Reynor in that movie is such a mixture of bravado and heartbreak, and we just fell in love with that actor, with that performance, with that movie overall.
And the first time we sat down with him for coffee, Dan Cohen and I basically nerded out for 45 minutes on Sing Street. So that was a big part of it, we're huge fans. And you'll see his performance and his character in Kin is nothing like anything you've seen him do before. And the chemistry between Jack and Miles, who plays Eli, and Zoe Kravitz, this trio on the road, kind of outside the norm, thinking strangers, regular society. It's really dynamic, and it's really special, and it's very touching. But, yeah, Sing Street was the thing that was a desire for us on Reynor.
Yeah, and also Free Fire. He's really good in that as well.
LEVY: Yeah, I mean the truth is, I've never seen a false note from him, or a weak performance, and Kin is no exception. And what's really cool, just in case I don't get a chance to say it, Steve, because I will have to go in five minutes for this flight, the movie it's unusual, it's not a cookie cutter road drama by any stretch. And it's also not at all a generic science fiction, action piece; it's legitimately both of those things in equal measure. And, I think the trailer, which I think this is article is penned, I'm really happy to say that, and this is not always the case, our Kin new trailer is a really good and truthful portrait of the kind of dual nature of our movie.
For more on Kin:
WASHINGTON - Embattled US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned Monday evening, after reports that he misled senior Trump White House officials about his conversations with the Russian Ambassador in Washington, marking an embarrassing setback for an administration only three weeks old.
President Donald Trump has named retired Army Lt Gen Keith Kellogg as acting national security adviser. Kellogg previously served as Flynn's chief of staff on the National Security Council. Flynn blamed his resignation late Monday on the “fast pace of events” that led him to “inadvertently” give Vice President Mike Pence and others “incomplete information” about his phone conversations with Russia's ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.
“I have sincerely apologised to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology,” Flynn wrote in his resignation letter. Pence had defended Flynn's contacts with Russia, and when it became clear the national security adviser had not been forthcoming, serious questions were raised about his ability to keep his job.
A senior naval officer who served under Trump's Defense Secretary James Mattis is the leading candidate to replace Michael Flynn, two US officials revealed.
Vice Admiral Robert Harward, who was deputy commander of US Central Command under Mattis, will likely replace Flynn, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the White House scrambled to contain the fallout from the abrupt departure of one of the president's top advisers.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Tuesday that President Donald Trump asked for the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after his level of trust in Flynn eroded to the point that he felt he needed to make a change.
Spicer said Trump had been concerned that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russian officials before Trump took office on Jan. 20. Trump had been reviewing Flynn's situation for a few weeks, he said.
Amid congressional calls for an investigation into the extent to which Flynn discussed the possibility of lifting US sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to Washington, Spicer said the White House legal counsel had reviewed the situation and believed Flynn's case was viewed "not as a legal issue but a trust issue."
Spicer said Trump was informed of Flynn's conversations with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak and asked counsel to review the case. "The erosion of that trust, frankly, was the issue," Spicer said.
Flynn's sudden exit comes just 24 days into Trump's presidency and represents a dramatic overhaul of his team of senior aides that has been consumed by controversy. Flynn, the former head of the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) was a trusted adviser to Trump throughout the 2016 campaign, but was seen as a controversial figure by many inside and outside the White House. He noted his friendship with the president in his resignation letter, thanking him for “his personal loyalty” and adding, “This team will go down in history as one of the greatest presidencies in US history.”
Flynn's future at the White House had been the topic of intense speculation since last Friday, after reports first emerged that he backtracked on his denial that he talked about sanctions against Russia for its election-related hacking with its top envoy in the US. Those reports, along with his longstanding ties to Russia, sparked concerns among US officials and members of Congress in both parties. The Justice Department reportedly warned Trump White House counsel Don McGahn shortly after Trump's inauguration that Flynn may have been vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians due to discrepancies between what he told Kislyak and Pence. Pence and others publicly said Flynn never discussed sanctions against Russia during his pre-inauguration conversations with Kislyak. Flynn later admitted the topic may have come up during his talks with the ambassador. Relying on Flynn's account, Pence told CBS News in mid-January that Flynn “did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.”
The vice president was reportedly angered after a Washington Post report was published last week claimed Flynn did discuss the sanctions, and he later apologised to Pence. But that apparently was not enough for Flynn to save his job. Trump stayed silent on Flynn's status; he was not asked about it during a news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, while his senior aides sent mixed signals to the press about Flynn's future.
Flynn joined other senior aides to Trump during the press conference, sitting in the front row of the East Room and prompting speculation he might be spared.
Senior counselor Kellyanne Conway said he enjoyed the “full confidence” of Trump on Monday afternoon. But soon after, White House Spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters the president was “evaluating” the Flynn situation with the vice president. Flynn's departure is sure to spark even more questions about how much Trump knew about Flynn's conversations with Russia.
Spicer was unequivocal, however, when asked whether Trump has been aware that Flynn was speaking about sanctions with the Russian ambassador. "No, absolutely not,” the spokesman said. Flynn reportedly spoke with Kislyak multiple times during the transition, including on Dec. 29, the day then-President Obama retaliated against Moscow for its hacking of Democratic political groups that intelligence agencies allege was done to aid Trump's campaign. Russia declined to respond with reciprocal sanctions, prompting questions about whether Flynn had provided assurances to the Russian diplomat the punishments would be rescinded once Trump took office. While there is no evidence an explicit assurance was given, US officials who saw a transcript of the call told the Post and other outlets it merited investigation. Flynn's talks also represented a break with longstanding protocol. Some legal experts believe they could have violated the Logan Act, which bars private citizens from interfering with official US diplomacy. No one has ever been prosecuted under the law.
US Secret Service director stepping down
US Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy plans to step down next month, the agency said on Tuesday, two years after he took charge of the agency following high-profile security lapses by the service responsible for protecting the president.
"Congratulations Dir Clancy on your retirement! The men & women of the @SecretService are grateful for your 29 years of service & leadership," the Secret Service said on Twitter.
Clancy will leave on March 4, an agency spokesman said.
Clancy's departure means that President Donald Trump will be able to select his own security chief. The Secret Service has almost 7,000 employees and is charged with protecting the president and his family as well as combating counterfeiting.
ISLAMABAD, Oct. 6 (APP): Foreign Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif has said that his meeting with Secretary Tillerson was an important interaction after President Trump announced US South Asia Strategy on August 21.
At his interaction with US & Foreign Media at the Embassy
late night, he told the media that after the announcement of
this South Asia Strategy, the bilateral relationship between
Pakistan and the US have taken a new turn.
” If on one hand, US has its concerns about the future of
Afghanistan, Pakistan seeks recognition of its legitimate
security concerns in the region. We are genuinely concerned
with regard to the role accorded in the Strategy to India in
general and its efforts, geared to destabilization in
Balochistan, in particular.”
He informed that he was visiting Washington DC at the
invitation of Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson with whom
he had a most cordial and useful meeting.
“My visit is essentially in follow-up to Prime Minister
Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's meeting with Vice President Mike
Pence on the sidelines of UNGA on September 19, 2017.”
Pakistan greatly values its relationship with the US in
seven-decade long history of result-oriented cooperation,
he said in his opening remarks. “We want to build a
relationship founded on mutual respect. We firmly believe
that through consistent, structured and constructive
engagement, at political and diplomatic levels, both
the countries can continue to work together for the common goal of peace, stability and prosperity in South Asia.”
“We also see enormous investment and business opportunities in Pakistan for corporate America, particularly after Pakistan's remarkable successes in war against terror and significant reduction in terrorist incidents in the country, he said.
However, he added, “Pakistan believes that unless there is
stability in Afghanistan, the dividends of peace in the
region would continue to elude us.” To achieve that goal
both US and Pakistan need to work closely, he stressed.
“On our part, we have completely wiped out all the
hideouts used by terrorists and anti-state elements.
However, this is an ongoing process with continuing
intelligence based operations by law enforcement agencies
across the country,” he added.
“We have offered candid cooperation to Afghanistan during
the recent visit of COAS and Foreign Secretary to Kabul where they had successful and productive meetings with President Ashraf Ghani, the CEO Abdullah and others in the Afghan hierarchy,” he said.
Pakistan is extremely concerned about safe havens of
terrorists who are mostly operating from ungoverned spaces
in Afghanistan which are more than 40% of the total area of
the country, he added.
Substantiating his plea, he said a number of terrorists
attacks in Pakistan in recent months have been traced back
to these elements operating from these bases in Afghanistan.
“I would like to reiterate that Pakistan will continue to
play its positive role in bringing peace to the region
through measures agreed upon by all relevant stakeholders.
We believe that a political approach characterized by an
Afghan-owned and Afghan-led process will yield durable
peace in the interest of Afghanistan and the broader
region.”
He said, ” In our renewed efforts towards establishing
regional peace, we hope that the international media,
particularly the US media will play a positive role and
reflect Pakistan's changing realities in its
reporting.”
He also invited the media luminaries gathered there to
visit Pakistan with a view to acquiring a first-hand
experience of the fast changing reality in the country.
The pioneering chat app that taught us to text is pulling the plug. On December 15th, AOL Instant Messenger will shut down after running since 1997. AIM dominated online chat in North America at the turn of the century. But with SMS and social apps like Facebook and WhatsApp having conquered chat, AOL is giving up the fight with no planned replacement.
“We know there are so many loyal fans who have used AIM for decades; and we loved working and building the first chat app of its kind since 1997” AOL wrote on the AIM help page. “Our focus will always be on providing the kind of innovative experiences consumers want. We're more excited than ever to focus on building the next generation of iconic brands and life-changing products.”
TechCrunch reader Daniel Sinclair tipped the shut down to us, which follows the cut off of third-party apps back in March. Now AIM's official macOS, Windows, iOS, and Android apps are being pulled off life support.
“From setting the perfect away message to that familiar ring of an incoming chat, AIM will always have a special place in our hearts” AOL wrote to users in an email. People can download images they sent until December 15th, but the app's download links will start disappearing now. Unfortunately there's no way to save or port your buddy list.
Initially the chat experience built into AOL desktop, AIM launched as a standalone app in 1997. Its iconic Away Messages were the ancestor to the modern tweet and status update. It battled for supremacy with competitors like ICQ, and messengers from Yahoo and Microsoft MSN. But eventually text messaging, Google's GChat, and Facebook took over while AIM never fully figured out the shift to mobile. That led to AOL's fall from grace, going from being valued at $224 billion in today's money to just $4.4 billion when it was sold to Verizon in 2015. For context on the business AOL let slip away, WhatsApp sold that same year to Facebook for over $19 billion.
Back in March, a former AOL employee told Ars Technica that he estimated AIM usage had sunk to single-digit millions of users, and the cost of AOL keeping the OSCAR messaging protocol running became too high to justify.
Regardless of [Disclosure] TechCrunch being owned by AOL, this moment is bittersweet for me. AIM taught me to write as 12-year old trying to navigate the world of grade-school friendship and romance. I was a shy kid who'd fumble for words in person, but found my voice through the keyboard where I could compose and edit my thoughts before revealing them. After three straight all-night AIM chats, I asked out my first girlfriend, on pins and needles staring at my cathode ray tube until she agreed.
AIM was a domain parents didn't understand, giving it a feeling of clandestine cool — akin to getting one's first car but for the Internet generation. In fact, it was what first convinced me that social technology would change the way we interact with each other so vividly that it was worth studying and eventually writing about for a living.
So, farewell to AIM and my embarrassing screen name KDog313. Being a teenager will always sound like one of your incoming messages.

The Greater Milwaukee Foundation announced last week that they released approximately $95.5 million in grants back to the community of the Greater Milwaukee area in 2017. The GMF, a collection of charitable funds across Milwaukee, Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington Counties, has supported a wide array of nonprofits and programs that exist within these counties for the purpose of serving needs that exist within the community.
The GMF is made up of 1,300 charitable funds, according to their website. These funds could include an individual or a collection of people. The money raised by the charitable funds are then allocated to one of nine categories. The categories that the Foundation donated to in 2017 included human services, health, the environment and community development, which received the largest amount of grant money, totaling $56.78 million.
“At this time in our community, we recognize the need to especially focus and increase investment in cradle-to-career education and in neighborhoods where chronic disinvestment has led to economic and racial disparities.” said Ellen Gilligan, president and CEO of the Greater Milwaukee Foundation. “The Foundation's donors continue to expand their giving, leading to greater opportunities for progress and partnerships, and a higher quality of life for people throughout our region.”
There were three major grants that were given to institutions, each totaling $675,000, to focus on investigating health issues that, according to their press release, exist within “communities of color.” These grants were given to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Foundation, Marquette University and The Medical College of Wisconsin.
The Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Foundation will use the money to research sickle cell disease, which predominantly affects African Americans. Marquette University will seek to develop new therapies for heart failure in aging and African American populations. The Medical College of Wisconsin however, will research how colon cancer is screened in the African American population, and if financial barriers or personal preference have an impact on screening rates.
The Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Milwaukee, YWCA of Southeast Wisconsin and LISC Milwaukee also all received grants of over $100,000. The Boys and Girls Club of Greater Milwaukee received the money for their Sponsor-a-Scholar program, a program that helps students prepare for college. The YWCA of Southeast Wisconsin received money to hire a trainer that will “address racial justice issues, including the creation of additional racial justice education opportunities,” according to their press release. LISC Milwaukee received grants to continue their community revitalization programs.
There are currently 14 board of directors on the GMF, ranging from the President of the Marcus Corporation, Gregory S. Marcus, to Judge Pedro Colón who serves on the Milwaukee County Circuit Court.
Gilligan encouraged those interested in supporting the GMF to think about the larger picture.
“Philanthropy provides a unique way to not only express passion for an issue but contribute to solutions that build community,” said Gilligan.
By February, once seen as a time of plenty, Nyabolli Chok had run out of food for her three children in their village here in South Sudan. She knew they had to leave.
And this year is expected to be the worst yet.
“Ron reath,” she said — her words for the hunger season. South Sudan's dozens of ethnic groups use different names for the months when food becomes scarce until the next harvest. But the fears are the same: malnutrition, disease, even death.
“We were eating leaves off of trees,” she said, describing how she boiled them into a watery soup.
Even here in the capital, which had been largely immune to the food crisis, many families are finding it impossible to pay the steep prices demanded in the city's markets, their options vanishing as the currency crashes.
On top of that, peace talks have stalled and cease-fires have largely been ignored, which means the fighting has cut off some areas from emergency help. Aid workers have been targeted by government and rebel fighters alike, making food distribution increasingly difficult.
This year's harvest was the smallest on record since South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011, with the country producing only a fraction of its needs, according to the World Food Program.
Even during harvest time in January, when food was most abundant, more than 5 million people — almost half the population — did not have enough to eat. Now, as food runs out over the next few months, international officials expect that number to grow considerably, with millions potentially facing acute malnutrition.
More than four years of civil war — most of this young country's existence — have chased millions from their homes, leaving countless farms abandoned. The economy has been obliterated. Fighting has overcome some of the nation's most productive land. Food prices are ruinously high.
Dozens of the women lie outside on the floor, their children wrapped in blankets. The signs of malnutrition are clear: Swollen bellies and emaciated limbs. Skin hanging in folds from tiny bones. Bodies covered in open sores, the painful result of edema breaking the skin.
Families from across the country pile into a clinic for malnourished children, setting aside the political and ethnic divides that have torn this new nation to shreds. Some mothers come from areas backing the government. Others have husbands, brothers and sons who fight for the rebels.
Cecilia Kideen struggled to feed her 9-month-old daughter, Sarah. Her breast milk is not enough, as she barely eats one meal a day.
“The mothers,” she said, “are really suffering.”
South Sudan, the world's newest nation, was born from an enormous international push to end decades of conflict between the north and south of what was then Sudan.
But just two years later, the new country was at war.
In December 2013, a feud between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar quickly descended into a conflict that has fractured the country, killed tens of thousands of people and decimated what was already one of the world's least developed nations.
“There are very few populations that are escaping the impacts of hunger,” said Elizabeth White, Oxfam's South Sudan policy adviser. “But all roads lead back to conflict and insecurity.”
Talks between the government and opposition leaders have been postponed. But even if peace can be reached, the hunger crisis still looms.
Farming on the Front Lines
The civil war in South Sudan has set off the largest refugee crisis in Africa since the Rwandan genocide, the United Nations says. More than 2 million people have fled the country, crippling food production. Nearly 2 million others have abandoned their homes and remain scattered around the country, leaving behind ghost towns and untended fields.
At the nation's southern border, dozens of refugees cross a narrow bridge into Uganda each day, bringing stories of hunger with them.
Mary Yar, 20, arrived with her 1-year-old son at a small reception center on the Ugandan side. At the site, the first assessment that refugees go through is a malnutrition screening
“There is no food there,” Yar said of her home village, pointing back toward the bridge to South Sudan.
During the height of the hunger season last year, South Sudanese arrived by the thousands, said Geoffrey Chandiga, a child assessment officer.
He keeps a tally of new arrivals on a whiteboard, noting that officials are bracing for an uptick in the months ahead.
Two years ago, South Sudan's war expanded into southern parts of the country that had long been seen as the country's breadbasket. People flooded across the Ugandan border. Most have yet to return.
When U.N. peacekeepers visited the areas in early 2017, they saw entire villages burned to the ground.
$321.70 for a Plate of Beans
Under a sharp midmorning sun in the capital, Elizabeth Kenyi and her husband, Johnson Ali, plucked vegetables from their garden along the White Nile, a tributary of the Nile.
For two decades, they have sold their okra, peppers and tomatoes in a nearby market. But even with a plentiful harvest this year, they are finding it harder than ever to feed their family of seven.
“The money that I got from the garden is useless,” Ali said.
While their produce commands a higher price than it did last year, prices for the staple grains they buy, like maize and sorghum, are climbing fast.
South Sudan's currency is in free fall and hyperinflation has squeezed virtually everyone. Before the war, one U.S. dollar was worth about five South Sudanese pounds. By March, a dollar was worth about 220 pounds.
The impact has been devastating. A 2017 World Food Program report determined that the relative price of a meal in South Sudan was among the highest in the world.
It found that people here typically needed to spend 155 percent of their daily income for a single plate of bean stew. To put it another way, a meal that would cost a New Yorker just $1.20 would cost someone in Juba the equivalent of $321.70.
Awaiting Aid That Can't Be Delivered
With agriculture in tatters, emergency aid is keeping a growing share of the country alive.
By early 2018, half of South Sudan's population relied on food aid, according to the United Nations, and the percentage will grow as the hunger season reaches its peak in the coming weeks.
But delivering that aid is another matter entirely. The rainy season hits during these lean months, too, turning many roads into rivers of impassable mud.
Beyond that, at least 100 humanitarian workers have been killed here since the start of the conflict, 30 in the last year alone, targeted by warring parties that think the efforts are helping their enemies.
Even within the protected camps set up around the country by the United Nations, there is not enough food to go around.
Chok, the woman who boiled leaves for her children, had been at a protected area in Juba for a month. The camps sprang up in 2013 as ethnic minorities who feared violence from government forces and their supporters fled to the base of the U.N. peacekeeping mission. Many stayed and the camps have sprawled into makeshift cities ringed by barbed-wire fences.
The United Nations provides food to registered camp residents, but thousands inside have no official status, so they rely on their neighbors for food. The rations are simply not enough.
Aid workers say that so much of the country is on the move — with vast numbers of people fleeing places where violence erupts — that most new arrivals to Chok's camp have not been registered in more than a year. That means she and countless others receive nothing.
Staying in the camps is dangerous enough. Attacks and sexual abuse by camp officers have been widely reported. Other accounts have emerged of women trading sex for food. But leaving the camp brings an entirely new set of risks.
Tafisa Nyattie, 30, who has lived in a camp here since 2013, has six children. Her food rations regularly run out, so she leaves the camp daily to gather firewood, hoping to earn enough money for milk and soap to wash her children's clothes.
She walks up to three hours in each direction, braving threats from government forces before returning with a large bundle of wood on her head.
“They will rape you or beat you, and sometimes they kill you,” Nyattie said, recounting the well-documented dangers women have faced in the conflict. “Some government soldiers tried to rape me.”
On another day, she said, she was beaten and her leg was badly injured. But when she saw how hungry her children were, she decided she had no choice but to head back out again.
“You just go, and you don't know if you will come back to your children,” Nyattie said.
Hunger's Youngest Victims
The malnutrition clinic offers a chilling glimpse of what this hunger season may hold.
The hospital ward, frequently dark because of intermittent electricity, is treating nearly a dozen more children each day than it did this time last year. They come from around the country to be weighed, measured and given antibiotics and a milk formula before moving on to Plumpy'Nut, a peanut-based nutritional paste — if their bodies can handle it.
Many of the families here are not even victims of the horrors that have chased millions from their homes. Some have jobs, career plans and families to lean on — yet their children are still going hungry.
Selwa Anania, a restaurant worker from Juba, brought her 2-year-old son, Taban Zacharia, to the clinic. Her small salary does not go far in the market. Most days, it is only enough for a single meal of porridge.
Sylvia George, 27, fanned her son, Mandela Bisa, 2, who lay half-conscious on a bed, hooked up to an intravenous drip. The child's father is a student at Juba University, and the three live with George's mother, whom they rely on for food. There is never enough.
For now, with the peak of the hunger season still weeks away, the clinic manages the steady flow of patients, said Josephin Ruben, the head nutritionist.
But, she noted anxiously, there “will not be enough when we get to June and July.”

Does your iPhone 7 say “No Service” when you're oh-so-certain the signal is fine? Good news! You might be totally right.
Reports and rumors of a “No Service” bug impacting iPhone 7s have been floating around for well over a year now — and as of this afternoon, Apple is acknowledging the issue.
The company says it's determined that “a small percentage” of iPhone 7s will claim no service even when service is available.
The bad news: it's not an easy fix. A software update won't help this time. Apple says this issue stems from a faulty logic board, which means they'll have to physically repair your device.
The less-bad news: Apple will repair it for free, and if you've paid for such a repair already at the Genius Bar, they'll reimburse you. You can find details on that here. (One catch: if your device's screen is busted, you'll need to pay to have that fixed before they can get inside.)
Apple says devices made between September 2016 and February 2018 (basically the entire lifespan of the iPhone 7) might be impacted, particularly those sold in the US, China, Japan, Hong Kong, or Macao.
“The Middle” is a hell of a song, and as it turns out, it took a hell of a lot of work to pull off.
We, the listening public who helped the tune reach #1 at pop radio and #5 on Billboard's Hot 100, know it as the work of Zedd (the Russian-German EDM superproducer), Maren Morris (the Texas-bred, Nashville-based country singer), and Grey (the LA-based producer brothers). A new New York Times video feature about the making of the song reveals how many other people were involved, including at minimum two more producers (the duo the Monsters & Strangerz), one songwriter (young Australian native Sarah Aaron), and more than a dozen vocalists who auditioned for the part that eventually went to Morris.
Now, Variety has revealed the names of those singers, and you'll likely recognize quite a few of them. Those named in the report include include Demi Lovato, Carly Rae Jepsen, Tove Lo, Camila Cabello, Cabello's former Fifth Harmony group-mate Lauren Jauregui, Anne-Marie, Bishop Briggs, Bebe Rexha, Daya, and Elle King.
The report also traces the twists and turns that led to the song's release. For instance, “The Middle” was almost a Lovato single last spring, before Zedd was even involved with the song, but she chose “Sorry Not Sorry” instead. Cabello was ready to release the song last fall, but she pulled out two weeks before its scheduled drop date because she didn't want anything to overshadow her #1 hit “Havana.” Then it was going to be an Anne-Marie single, but among other political machinations, Zedd didn't want a single with the British singer at the same time she was releasing “Friends” with rival EDM hit-maker Marshmello.
Furthermore, the piece includes this eye-opening breakdown of Spotify's royalty payouts:
In simple math, a million streams on Spotify averages out to around $6,800 in revenue, the lion's share of which ($6,000) goes to the master rights holder (the label). The remaining (around $800) is allotted to the publishers, which then divide the earnings between their writers based on percentages of ownership (rates vary between paid and free streams). “The Middle,” as of this writing, had 236 million streams on the streaming service, which could net out $184,000 to the publishers — and that's just for Spotify. Factor in other DSPs like Apple Music, and it's already at $250,000. By comparison, Ed Sheeran's “Shape Of You,” the biggest song of 2017, has 1.7 billion streams on Spotify. A songwriter's share of that track easily tops a seven-figure payout.
If you think that's fascinating, read the whole report and check out the NYT video below too.
Barring last-minute information from the NCAA prior to Wednesday night's deadline to withdraw from the NBA draft, South Carolina's Brian Bowen will keep his name in and turn pro after receiving news that he will have to sit out next season at a minimum.
Bowen signed with Louisville out of high school and remained at school for the first semester following allegations from the FBI that his father took money from Adidas.
Bowen transferred to South Carolina prior to the start of the second semester and was hoping to gain eligibility for next season after missing all of his freshman campaign. However, the NCAA's student-reinstatement committee determined that Bowen will have to sit all of next season.
"That's at a minimum," one source close to the situation told ESPN. "That wasn't even a ruling, so he could face more."
Bowen attended the NBA draft combine earlier this month in Chicago, and most NBA executives told ESPN Bowen will likely go in the back end of the second round or undrafted.
Lori-Lynn Cronin wishes that her son Cody Isaacson wasn't at home in Chilliwack on Wednesday morning.
She would have preferred that he had been in jail — then he wouldn't have been shot, killed and made another victim in the ongoing gang war happening in Metro Vancouver and beyond.
Coverage of gangs on Globalnews.ca:
Isaacson, 28, was killed when a bullet came into his home beneath a windowsill in the 9200-block of Broadway St. Neighbours have alleged that it was a drug house.
The bullet struck him in the heart, his mom said. But that's not all that happened to him.
“Somebody was still ruthless enough to enter my son's bedroom and take anything that he could,” she told Global News.
“Somebody in there that just thought nothing of my son, and that's really hard.”

Isaacson's parents knew that this was just a matter of time.
He had been the bloodied victim of a home invasion in October.
His father David Isaacson said he called the police and asked whether anything was being done about that incident.
“I was basically stonewalled,” he told Global News.
Cronin said the ongoing gang-related shootings need to stop, no matter the cost.
“They're caught with weapons and they're just detained?” she asked.
Isaacson's parents are pleading that no one avenge his death — they don't want a vicious cycle of violence to tarnish their son's name.

DERA GHAZI KHAN-There are three weeks left to the general elections scheduled to be held on July 25, but, unlike other departments, no major transfer/posting could be made in the Border Military Police (BMP) administration, a local police force for de-excluded area commonly known as tribal area, to ensure transparency in the election.
Many politically-tainted Jamadar (circle officers) are still posted on key posts in the constituency of their family members or relatives and, the public fears, the influential officers will definitely attempt to manipulate the election results. Local civil society members and social activists, even political leaders have expressed their apprehensions that without reshuffling of the "blue-eyed officers" transparency could not be expected in election, arguing that these circle officers can easily play vital role in pre-poll rigging for power politics in tribal area.
According local political leaders who requested anonymity, Jamadar Azmat Sher Qaisrani is posted as Circle Officer Satta, in the constituency of PP-285, where his cousin namely Sardar Confucius Imam Qaisraniis is contesting election as independent candidate with the symbol of Pitcher.
Similarly, Jamadar Rizam Khan Khosa is posted as Circle Officer Toman Khosa, in the constituency of PP-287, where his uncle namely Sardar Mohsin Atta Khan Khosa is contesting election as independent candidate with the symbol of Bucket.
Jamadar Azhar Hassan Tipu Qaisrani is posted as circle officer Likhani, in the areas of PP-285 and NA-189, where his cousin Mrs Shamoona Abreen is contesting election on the PML-N ticket.
Similarly Jamadar Muhammad Umer Khan Buzdar is posted as circle officer Barthi, in constituency of PP-286, where his real brother Sardar Usman Khan Buzdar is candidate of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.
Jamadar Ejaz Ahmad Khan Leghari is posted as circle officer Sakhi Sarwar in NA-191, where his cousin Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari is a PML-N candidate. Moreover, Jamadar Abdullah Khan Leghari posted as circle officer Rakhi Gauj, Dafadar Kareem Nawaz Khan posted as circle officer Bawata and Dafadar Saeed Ahmad Khan posted as circle officer Khar are presently serving in the constituency of Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari who is also Sardar of Leghari tribe.
In fact, the BMP administration never has reshuffled officers on permanent basis for general election in the past like the Punjab Police department transfer / posting policy. Only election duty was assigned to BMP personnel in last 2013 election.
Talking to The Nation, Deputy Commissioner / Senior Commandant BMP Akbar Ali Bhatti said that on June 27, 2018, the DG Khan DC Office had sought recommendations from the Political Assistant / Commandant BMP on transfers and postings. "Now Lists of BMP personnel, keeping in view the political connections, have been prepared and action would be taken as per BMP rules," he claimed.
He assured that the district administration will ensure fair, free and transparent election across the district, particularly in the de-excluded area (tribal areas) where tribal elders are contesting election. "Insha Allah every voter will cost his/ her vote freely without fear or favour" he asserted.
CHICOPEE - A 21-year-old man accused of selling heroin to undercover officers multiple times was arrested after he slipped and fell on the ice while trying to flee from police.
Joseph Martinez, of 86 West Main St., was arrested on Friday afternoon and charged with three counts of distribution of heroin, possession with intent to distribute heroin and resisting arrest, said Michael Wilk, public information officer.
Chicopee Police narcotics officers working with the Hampden County Drug Task Force had been conducting an investigation into illegal drug sales for several weeks and allegedly purchased heroin from Martinez during that time, he said.
Friday at about 12:40 p.m., Martinez allegedly sold 100 bags of heroin to an undercover officer on Grove Street. After the sale he started walking up Grove Avenue and police officers working backup attempted to arrest him, Wilk said.
"He turned, recognized the officers, and began to flee. As the suspect ran onto Pine Street, he slipped on the ice, fell and slid across the street into one of the unmarked vehicles," he said.
Martinez continued to fight with officers even after falling but was handcuffed. Police, who had earlier received a search warrant, then went to Martinez's home and found 200 more bags of what is believed to be heroin, Walk said.
He is currently being held on $100 bail and scheduled to be arraigned on Monday.

The Alabama Emergency Management Agency has been gearing up for Monday's severe weather since last week. (Source: WSFA 12 News)
The Alabama Emergency Management Agency has been gearing up for Monday's severe weather since last week.
"Today really began last Friday when we started our communication with the national weather service knowing what was coming," Jeff Smitherman, Executive Operations Officer for the Alabama EMA, said.
They arrived as early as 5 a.m. on Monday morning to monitor forecasts and communicate with other agencies to make sure the state is prepared.
"We come in and we start our conversations with our divisions, our regions to ensure they're ready for the day,” Smitherman said.
"Any of the resources like search and rescue teams and law enforcement support, the personnel behind me will work to coordinate that from the state down to any local that their needs may surpass what they're capable of doing," Smitherman said.
Like Ricky Adams, the Director of Field Operations.
"What I'm doing right now is following the state log system. It's a system where all the counties enter their information such as damage and needs for resources and we'll monitor that and see what that is and pass it along to the right individual here in the EOC so we can address there needs," Adams said.
Think of him as the liaison, allowing for the sharing of information between the state and local governments.
"We follow the weather reports and start communicating with the counties and understand which ones are experiencing damage," Adams said.
At the EMA, severe weather makes for a long day at the office. But for Smitherman and Adams, it's just another day on the job.

University of Iowa president Bruce Harreld is following the lead of his counterpart at Iowa State University and calling for an increase of 7.08 percent in tuition for undergraduate resident students in each of the next 5 years.
The U-I was the last of the three state-supported schools to make their presentation to the Board of Regents Tuition Task Force.
“It is quite clear that our ability to compete is based on our ability to chase and complete our strategic plan,” Harreld says. “In order to implement that strategic plant — resources will be required — and tuition must be part of that equation.”
Harreld says salaries at the school have fallen behind their peers due to a cut in state funding and that is going to hurt the quality of the education offered. “It has resulted in significant talent loss. Over 90 per year over the last two years, 90 faculty members over the last two years have left us. It is a trend we must fix and we will,” Harreld says.
He says the tuition paid by in-state students is at the bottom of their peer group and near the bottom for students from out-of-state. The proposed increases would add $3,050 dollars onto the base tuition for an undergraduate student by the end of the five-year period.
Harreld says the U-I cannot continue forward with its plan to improve student success without the proper funding. “We are not at a point in which a choice will need to be made about what quality of an institution we want to be and how we will support the success of our students,” Harreld says. “Increasing tuition is never easy. It's not something that anyone ever wants to do — particularly because of the impact and the burden it places on the students and their families.”
Harreld says the proposed increases are based on state funding staying the same and the student population staying around its current level. “We certainly understand the challenges related to increasing tuition. That's why we are committed to maintaining our focus on first-generation students and increasing our need and merit-based student aid,” Harreld says. “A careful balance between an increase in tuition and appropriate scholarship will help mitigate the impact on those who might be struggling with the cost.”
Iowa State University interim president Ben Allen proposed a similar seven-percent increase in tuition last week. While the University of Northern Iowa President Mark Nook said tuition would have to increase 6.7 percent, followed by increases of 5.2 percent, 3.7 percent and 3.1 percent if state support stayed the same.

One of these days, Connor McDavid is bound to snap.
It has to happen, doesn't it?
When he plays like this — dancing, singing, playing an instrmment, conducting the orchestra — and then not a single note registers on the night. Not a goal. Not an assist. Not a sound.
Nothing for hockey's single most entertaining player.
This wasn't just another of 82 NHL stops for McDavid in his third season. He doesn't view it that way. This is home. This matters. This is where his people are. This is where his family and his old coaches and hockey friends come to see what they can get only on television. This is where he turns it up, just a notch — his level starts above the rest of the pack. This day, this night, this trip to the place he used to sit with his dad and watch games, means everything to him.
And that's how he played it Sunday night in a circle-the-calendar night on the Oilers schedule. He played it like no one else can play it. With Bobby Orr in the building watching Wayne Gretzky and Paul Coffey, too.
There have been all kinds of special players in hockey history. But Orr, McDavid's agent, Gretzky, his Edmonton mentor, and Coffey, whom he has come to know, were the kind of players you couldn't take your eyes off. You followed them the way we normally follow the puck. And McDavid is the No. 1 attraction in hockey, carrying the puck from behind his own net the way Orr once did, and using a speed only Coffey can understand and then finding those open around him, the way only Gretzky could.
That was a McDavid Sunday night — maybe as great as he's ever been, even some Edmonton front office people were saying that — and both he and his snakebit Oilers had nothing to show for it. They were somehow shut out by the outplayed Leafs, shut out by the backup goaltender, Curtis McElhinney, who did the Dominik Hasek thing for one night of his career.
McDavid did just about everything. He created offence. He set up players. He used his speed to make the Leafs look helpless. He hit goal posts. He hit cross bars. He hit men open in the slot. He had a five-point kind of night with no points on the scorecard and how long can you do this and not be ready to explode?
Especially from a night in which he was on the hook for so many local tickets and he quietly complained — as many of us have — about the cost of buying Leaf tickets. This was McDavid's most expensive night of the season and he left nothing for chance, except an inability all around him to find a way to finish.,
“You want it to go on 5-10 minutes longer,” McDavid said afterwards, clearly shaken by the 1-0 defeat at the Air Canada Centre. “We didn't have any luck tonight.”
Before that he said: “For a 1-0 hockey game, this was pretty entertaining.”
[protected-iframe id="4d914a0352df14ff6d9a5410ccb31d3c-126506751-127512401" info="https://www.nhl.com/oilers/video/embed/post-game-raw--connor-mcdavid/t-277437406/c-55611603?autostart=false" width="540" height="360"]
Of that, he was correct. For the Oilers, it was entertaining and heartbreaking. This was the best night of this Air Canada Centre season as pure entertainment, the game most fun to watch, the most surprising, the most entertaining. You watch this kind of game and you want to scream at the National Hockey League for its geography. Toronto and Edmonton play once a year here, once a year in Edmonton, and that's it.
And even on a night when Auston Matthews was missing and the matchup was missing and the father and son who walked in wearing the jersey of one young star and the jersey of the other, you wished there was hockey like this every night.
The NHL doesn't need bigger nets or more scoring or even smaller goaltending equipment to be great. It needs more Edmonton and Toronto games.
“Two pretty exciting teams when they're going,” said Todd McLellan, the Oilers coach. It may happen one day in a Stanley Cup final. And if that doesn't happen, we'll all feel a little cheated along the way.
Gretzky never played Mario Lemieux in a playoff series. Sidney Crosby has yet to face Jonathan Toews. Matthews and McDavid: That would be hockey heaven, no matter what the result.
“You don't get anything for being close,” said McDavid, knowing how far down the Oilers are in the standings, knowing that every loss comes with the notion they are one game further away from qualifying for the playoffs. “We were the better team.”
An NHL without McDavid in the playoffs is a poorer league than it was last April. But there are four months yet to figure this all out.
“This is nothing more than an Oilers-Leafs matchup,” he said before the game, even realizing those words didn't necessarily ring true. It was more everything than just another game.
McDavid played it that way. He didn't just put on a show Sunday night, he was the show.

New Delhi: Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Monday chaired a meeting to review foreign direct investment (FDI) policy in certain sectors, people familiar with the matter said.
The meeting was attended by commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman, power minister Piyush Goyal and senior officials in the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), the people cited above added, who remained tight-lipped about the deliberations held in the meeting.
The meeting appears to be a follow up of the meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called last month on FDI policy, the people said. The meeting assumes significance as the government is considering to liberalise FDI policy in certain sectors such as single brand retail, multi brand retail and construction.
The government is relaxing norms to provide investor friendly climate to foreign players, and in turn attract more FDI to boost economic growth and create jobs. Foreign direct investment in the country grew by 9% to $43.47 billion in 2016-17.
Iran Focus
London, 6 Oct - On October 5, Republican Senator Tom Cotton told the Washington Post that military action against the Iranian Regime was “a credible option” and the renegotiation of the nuclear deal should be a discussion between the United States, European partners, Israel, and Arab allies.
This came just ten days before Donald Trump must decide whether or not to recertify Iran's compliance with the nuclear agreement — which places restrictions on the Iranian Regime's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
When questioned on whether the military option was a good idea, Cotton replied that the US certainly had the option and it need not be like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan which have left a bitter taste in the mouths of the American public.
He said: “Most of your argument [against] is that we don't have a credible military option, which is simply false. President Obama often implied that the only choice we had was capitulation under the [nuclear deal] or a decade of occupation after forceful regime change through the introduction of 150,000 mechanized troops, like we do in Iraq — that's simply not the case.”
He continued: “We have a number of calibrated military strikes — like Ronald Reagan conducted against Libya, like Bill Clinton conducted repeatedly against Iraq like Donald Trump conducted against Syria. Like Ronald Reagan conducted against Iran itself, by blowing up half of its navy and several oil platforms.”
One of Cotton's biggest concerns about the nuclear deal is that even if Iran was in complete compliance (evidence show that this is not true), it still allows the Regime to develop nuclear weapons in less than a generation, which is why he advocates for renegotiation.
He said: “Ultimately put Iran in the position of being a legitimate and lawful nuclear power in a mere 13 years.”
He continued: “I would say they're [Iran] not complying, fully, and verifiably, and transparently… and it clearly is not in our vital national security interests. Iran's role in the region is a campaign of imperial aggression across the Middle East. So, it's time for a new approach.”
Cotton is believed to have met privately with Trump to put across his views on Iran and how the nuclear certification should go.
Earlier this week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the administration would place several options before Trump with regard to the nuclear deal, which could include military action but is more likely to include decertification with and without the rollback of sanctions.
But this was something more. It seems that like the mother of dragons, King Jon may have some Targaryen blood — which explains the bond with Drogon.
In this case, it was Dragon to human, as Jon Snow, the King in The North stroked Daenery's Drogon. And we all know the way to a girl's heart is through her kids.
After the fire and fury of the last episode of Game of Thrones , where Daenerys Targaryen incinerated the Lannister army, it was nice to get back to some normalcy — to make a human connection amid the carnage.
There was some heavy petting going on in Westeros. And it was sorely needed.
When Jon takes his leave of the Queen on a mission, he says: “If I don't return at least you don't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.”
And certainly the Queen and King seem to be headed to a love match.
For the icy Daenerys, that is tantamount to saying “I have the hots for you, even though according to People Magazine, those furry rugs you are wearing for a costume came from IKEA.”
If there is a match to be made, there is a possibility that — shades of Luke and Leia — Daenerys could potentially be Jon's aunt. That would up the ick factor moving forward. But interbreeding has never been an issue in the series.
In fact, brother and sister Jaime and Cersei Lannister are apparently expecting another child.
Queen Cersei broke the news to her brother this way: “Dead men. Dragons. And Dragon Queens. Whatever stands in our way we will defeat it. For ourselves, for our house, (and patting her stomach) for this.”
And it seems those HBO pirates demanding a ransom for hacking into the media company are no match for Cersei.
Last week's pirated episode, which was dumped online days before airing still hit a record 10.2 million viewers, besting the season premiere.
So far the pacing has been spectacular, with faithful fans receiving a big pay off as the threads come together.
Back in the north where Jon Snow has left Sansa in charge, it seems Littlefinger is doing his usual thing, sowing the seeds of chaos.
This time between Sansa and her sister Arya by planting a letter in his room that he wants Arya to find.
And showing how impressively deep the plot lines go in GoT, Gendry, bastard son of the late king Robert Baratheon has returned to help Jon Snow. We haven't seen Gendry since season three when he was hanging out with Hot Pie and Arya.
But in what seems to be the only off kilter, time wasting sub plot so far, Jon Snow decides he will take a team beyond the wall to capture one of the walking dead White Walkers so he can bring it back to show his enemy Cersei that they have a bigger foe to face than each other.

How beloved secondary characters helped make ‘Game of Thrones' a cultural force
What's next for Jaime Lannister on Game of Thrones?
“I've come to believe accommodation with the dragon queen would be in our interests,” says Cersei.
The dragon queen is still doing some on the job training, it seems. As much as Daenerys says she is not like her cruel father, the more authoritarian her response becomes.
She also has a fetish for a man on bended knee.
After defeating the Lannister army she gives a soaring speech to the captured soldiers about how unlike crooked Queen Cersei she is.
“Join me and together we will leave the world a better place than we found it,” she says in words that could have come from Obama's Yes We Can campaign.
The speech works great, but ends with “Refuse and Die,” which is more Sopranos, less Bernie Sanders.
At that point, and despite the protest of her adviser Tyrion Lannister, she has Drogon incinerate the two Tarly men who are fighting for Cersei. That includes Randyll Tarly and Dickon.
The execution has the intended effect, and restores some faith back into the storyline where characters of consequence are dispassionately dispatched in the service of plot.
Given that last episode's dragon fight spared the lives of so many crucial characters including Jaime and his right hand man Bronn, GoT was looking suspiciously like an episode of MacGyver with the protagonists getting out of trouble conveniently in the nick of time. Thankfully, there are no paper clips in Westeros.

In response to an Israeli announcement earlier on Wednesday of the approval of almost 2,000 new homes in Yehudah and Shomron, the White House expressed its disapproval, however gently.
“The president has made his position on new settlement activity clear, and we encourage all parties to continue to work towards peace,” a spokesperson for the National Security Council was quoted by The Times of Israel as saying.
“The Israeli government has made clear that going forward, its intent is to adopt a policy regarding settlement activity that takes the president's concerns into consideration,” the spokesperson said.
“The United States welcomes this. As the president has said repeatedly, the administration is firmly committed to pursuing a comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians.”
The Israeli Defense Ministry approved on Wednesday plans for the construction of 1,957 in Yehudah and Shomron.
Of that number, the Civil Administration's High Planning Subcommittee gave final approval to 696 housing units, while the remaining 1,262 were okayed through an earlier planning stage known as a “deposit.”
About 300 of the units in the former batch are located in towns outside the so-called “settlement blocs” that most Israeli leaders assert will be part of Israel in any final status deal with the Palestinians.
Some 450 permits were earmarked for Gush Etzion. They include 170 units in Neve Daniel, 84 in Kfar Eldad and another 38 in Kfar Etzion, in addition to the 150 approved by the council last time, according to Arutz Sheva.
The Gush Etzion Council continues to pursue plans for 17,000 housing units in the region, with hopes that ways can be found to reduce the time it takes to obtain final approval for building.
Shlomo Ne'eman, head of the Gush Etzion Regional Council, said, “We thank the government for the hundreds of units that were approved today in Gush Etzion, together with some 2,500 units in the rest of Judea and Samaria. Even so, we again call on the government to remove all restrictions on construction in Judea and Samaria – we need a lot more! We will continue to submit more and more plans, we will continue to build, we will continue to develop Gush Etzion and we will work towards full sovereignty. “

THERE are about 1.2 million families eligible for childcare subsidies in Australia.
But come July 2, 489,000 will miss out on the funding based on current figures on people registered with the government database, unless they take action and switch to the new system.
The Turnbull Government is combining existing subsidies for childcare into a single means- and activity-tested payment.
To be eligible families must update their Centrelink account details through myGov.
Education Minister Simon Birmingham said the switch from July 2 wasn't automatic and those who didn't update their details could miss out.
Required information includes estimated income for 2018/19 and approximate work hours for both parents.
Under the new system, both parents must be working, studying, volunteering or searching for work at least eight hours a fortnight to be eligible for the subsidies.
Households with a total annual income under $186,958 will no longer face a cap on the amount of rebate paid by to them each year.
For those earning more than this, the annual cap will lift from $7500 to just over $10,000 per child.
"We know many families are time-poor but this is about giving them the support they need and deserve to pay their childcare bills," Mr Birmingham said.
"And it's worth the 10 minutes or so it might take to update your details because ultimately you'll be hundreds or possibly thousands of dollars a year better off."
Mr Birmingham said although arrangements were in place to ensure families who failed to meet the deadline didn't miss out, it would take time to repay withheld money once they had signed up.
Labor early childhood education spokeswoman Amanda Rishworth said the government should have worked with childcare centres at the coalface to educate families and not focus on a "slick advertising campaign".
Labor claims one in four families will be worse off under the changes and the majority of those missing out are in the lowest two income brackets.
Parents can use an online calculator to estimate the amount of money they can get back from their childcare fees.

SO WHAT ARE THE CHANGES AND HOW WILL THEY AFFECT YOU?
We've provided an overview here but Mr Birmingham will also host a session on Facebook Live at news.com.au's headquarters next Thursday afternoon, June 7.
Mr Birmingham will be able to answer questions live and discuss any other issues.
Make sure you like our Facebook page to be involved, or send any questions through on the email below.
THESE ARE THE BASICS
It can be a bunch of confusing acronyms and a sliding scale of rebates, but in a nutshell the current Child Care Rebate (which covers 50 per cent of childcare fees up to an annual cap of $7500) and the means-tested Child Care Benefit will be replaced with the new subsidy.
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS
• Families earning $66,958 or less will receive a payment equivalent to 85 per cent of their fees
• Families with a total income of $66,958-$171,958 will receive a payment that is tapered down from 85 per cent to 50 per cent
• Families on $171,958-$251,248 will receive a payment equivalent to 50 per cent of their fees
• Families on $251,248-$341,248 will receive a payment that is tapered down from 50 per cent to 20 per cent
• Families on $341,248-$351,248 will receive a payment equivalent to 20 per cent of their fees
• Families earning more than $351,248 will receive no subsidy
HOW MUCH YOU COULD GET
• A family on $50,000 - both parent/s working, with two children aged under 6 in long day care two days a week at $100 a day will be around $2000 better off a year
• A family on $80,000 - both parent/s working, with two children aged under 6 in long day care three days a week at $100 a day will be more than $3000 better off a year
• A family on $150,000 - both parent/s working, with two children aged 6 and under in long day care three days a week at $100 a day will be more than $1000 better off a year
SO HOW MUCH ACTIVITY WILL YOU HAVE TO DO?
• Families working 8-16 hours per fortnight are eligible to receive 36 hours per fortnight of subsidised care
• Families working 16-48 hours per fortnight are eligible to receive 72 hours per fortnight of subsidised care
• Families working more than 48 hours per fortnight are eligible to receive 100 hours per fortnight of subsidised care

WHAT'S AN ACTIVITY ANYWAY?
• Paid work including leave and maternity leave
• Study and training
• Unpaid work in the family business
• Looking for work
• Volunteering
• Self-employment
• Others on a case-by-case basis
IT ALSO DEPENDS on WHERE YOUR KIDS GET CARED FOR
Calculated by the hour using these hourly rate caps:
• Centre-based day care - $11.77 per hour
• Family day care - $10.90 per hour
• Outside school hours care - $10.29 per hour
• In home care - $25.48 per hour (per family)
SO WHAT ELSE?
• There are exemptions for parents who legitimately cannot meet activity test requirements
• The parent or guardian with the lowest hours of activity per fortnight will determine the hours of subsidised care
• The package includes a $1.2 billion safety net for vulnerable and disadvantaged children, as well as those from regional and remote communities
• There are additional subsidies for families who need practical help, grandparents who are primary carers, families experiencing temporary financial hardship and families transitioning from income support to work
• Those additional subsidies replace a number of existing payments including the Special Child Care Benefit and the Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance
• It is estimated the reforms will encourage more than 230,000 families to increase their involvement in the workforce
DON'T FORGET - NO JAB, NO PAY
• Children must be immunised in accordance with the National Immunisation Program schedule or be on a recognised catch-up schedule
• If children aren't immunised they must have a valid immunisation exemption recorded on the register.
• Parents can check what vaccinations their child needs here or speak with their doctor
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO BEFORE JULY 2
• Provide new information and confirm current details using your Centrelink online account through myGov
• Provide your combined family income estimate for 2018-19, recognised activity hours and type of childcare your family uses
The death of a 92-year-old Montgomery woman whose body was found inside her home Monday is being investigated as a homicide, the Montgomery Police Department has confirmed.
Investigators say Mary Gedel's body was found in her home in the 1900 block of South Court Street after an acquaintance reported they hadn't seen her in several days.
Gedel's death was initially called only a death investigation but has since been upgraded to a homicide after a forensic evaluation confirmed the elderly woman's death came as a result of blunt-force trauma. There were also indications forced entry had been made into the home.
No arrests have been made at this point. The circumstances of the homicide remain under investigation.
Anyone with information is asked to call CrimeStoppers at 215-STOP, Secret Witness at 625-4000, or the Montgomery Police Department at 625-2831.

Bill Belichick wins Super Bowls by wearing his players down to the point that they question the very nature of their existence — and then he rebuilds them in his image. The Patriots head coach once told the media that his “personal coaching philosophy” is to “make things as difficult as possible for players in practice.” He has sent more than a few full-grown men running to other teams and other coaches to cry about how mean he is.
NEVERTHELESS — here is the greatest, most-feared American football head coach of all time, looking average as hell, pulling up on an unsuspecting Chick-fil-A employee to pick up his fast food.

It's unsettling to see him doing normal things and trying to blend in when he's so obviously not a normal person, is it not? There's just something eerie about watching a man who spends most of his time breaking the psyches of the largest, strongest, toughest guys on the planet as he waits at the drive-through for his delightful chicken sandwich.
He's also a gajillionaire who spends his offseason in Nantucket hanging out on a boat that get its name changed every time he wins another ring, and he's just saddling up to the pick-up window like he's supposed to be there? Like he's one of us? I don't buy it.
That' all not to mention that it's the most Belichick thing in the world to love a fast food chain that starts with the end of his last name. If he doesn't call it Belichick-fil-A as he eats it then I don't know what the point of all this even is.
Verizon will no longer be the exclusive U.S. mobile carrier for watching NFL games on smartphones and tablets. According to an announcement this morning, the company – and TechCrunch's parent, by way of Oath – says that it has closed a new deal with the National Football League that will allow it to stream live games to fans regardless of mobile network.
The deal includes in-market and national games, including national pre-season, regular season, playoff games, and the Super Bowl nationwide. It doesn't include the Sunday afternoon out-of-market games, which AT&T's DirecTV has through the end of the 2022-23 season.
However, thanks to the new deal, nearly all NFL games will now be available across a number of digital and media platforms, including Yahoo, Yahoo Sports, AOL, Verizon's g90 streaming app, and the NFL mobile app.
In addition to the live games themselves, the new agreement will also include NFL highlights and other weekly content, plus jointly developed original content.
The full deal goes into effect in the 2018-19 season, but some NFL postseason games will hit Yahoo, Yahoo Sports, go90 and the NFL Mobile app in January, 2018.
Verizon says its combination of digital and mobile properties reach over 200 million monthly unique users in the U.S. – an increased reach for the NFL, while also serving as a way for Verizon to better take advantage of the platforms it acquired via AOL and Yahoo (the combination that's now called Oath).
And notably, the NFL is paying more for that expanded reach, too, according to reports. Recode's sources say the new deal will cost Verizon over $1.5 billion over five years. The WSJ says the deal is worth more than $2 billion, and that Verizon's annual rights and sponsorship fee to the NFL will rise from its current $250 million to more than $450 million.
Verizon says that it will continue to be an Official Sponsor of the NFL, and is also working with NFL teams on Smart Stadium technology to improve stadium operations.
The move comes at a time when the NFL, along with other sports leagues, are trying to reach the new, younger audience who often don't watch live sports through traditional pay TV. The cord cutters and “cord nevers” instead turn to over-the-top streaming services like Sling TV to catch sports on ESPN, for example, or they might hook up a digital antenna for local channels. Some streaming services are even betting on the fact that many would prefer to pay less for access to TV by removing the costly channels carrying live sports, as is the case with newcomer Philo.
Meanwhile, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are also trying to snag some of that sports action for themselves. Facebook, for instance, did a deal with the NFL earlier this year to distribute highlights and recaps. Other big tech companies are vying for NFL games, too, like Amazon, which paid $50 million to stream 10 games for Prime members.
“We're making a commitment to fans for Verizon's family of media properties to become the mobile destination for live sports,” said Lowell McAdam, Chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications, in a statement. “The NFL is a great partner for us and we are excited to take its premier content across a massive mobile scale so viewers can enjoy live football and other original NFL content where and how they want it. We believe that partnerships like this are a win for fans, but also for partners and advertisers looking for a mobile-first experience,” he said.

At least 16 people were killed by a car bomb in a busy square in Baghdad's sprawling Sadr City district on Monday, while Islamic State attacks on military positions north of the capital killed 16 pro-government fighters, sources said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, which also wounded more than 40 people, but Islamic State regularly targets civilian areas in the heavily fortified capital, even after losing most of the northern and western territory it seized in 2014.
Three bombs killed 29 people across the capital on Saturday, and an attack near the southern city of Najaf on Sunday left seven policemen dead.
US-backed Iraqi forces are currently fighting to push Islamic State, the Sunni Muslim militant group, from the northern city of Mosul, the fighters' last major stronghold in the country, but are facing fierce resistance.
The recapture of Mosul would probably spell the end for Islamic State's self-styled caliphate, but the militants would still be capable of fighting a guerrilla-style insurgency in Iraq, and plotting or inspiring attacks on the West.
Since the offensive began on Oct. 17, elite forces have retaken a quarter of Mosul in the biggest ground operation in Iraq since the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said the group would be driven out of the country by April.
As clashes continued in and around Mosul on Monday, Islamic State also targeted military positions away from the main battlefield.
Militants attacked an army barracks near Baiji, 180 km (112 miles) north of Baghdad, killing four soldiers and wounding 12 people, including Sunni tribal fighters, army and police sources said.
They seized weapons there and launched mortars at nearby Shirqat, forcing security forces to impose a curfew and close schools and offices in the town, according to local officials and security sources.
Shirqat mayor Ali Dodah said Islamic State seized three checkpoints on the main road linking Baiji to Shirqat following the attacks. Shelling in Shirqat had killed at least two children, he told Reuters by phone.
In a separate incident, gunmen broke into a village near Udhaim, 90 km (56 miles) north of Baghdad, where they executed nine Sunni tribal fighters with shots to the head, police and medical sources said.
At least three pro-government Shi'ite militia fighters were also killed and seven wounded when militants attacked their position near Udhaim with mortar rounds and machine guns, police sources said.
LAHORE : Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Tuesday said Pakistan will be among 20 large economies of the world by 2025.
Speaking to the media persons after inaugurating third China Agro Chemical summit in Lahore, he said if political obstacles were not created in the past four years, the country would have gone far ahead.
The PML-N devised an inclusive future line of action when it came to power in 2013, the minister said and added barely a day passed without any incident of terrorism before 2013 but now peace was restored. He said India is involved in the recent acts of terrorism in Pakistan.
Iqbal said the country faced acute energy crisis, but the government after assuming power took initiatives to plug the shortfall and generated enough electricity, which was not even done in the 70 years.
He said Pakistan is an agrarian economy; therefore, there are immense prospects for entrepreneurship in this field.
He said today's Pakistan is safer and more prosperous as compared to that of the past.
The minister said the government is taking all possible measures to restore complete peace in the country and anti-terror actions are yielding positive results.
The minister said efforts are also being made to strengthen democracy in the country adding that the elections will be held on time.
Later addressing the inaugural ceremony of three-day Sustainable Development Conference in Islamabad on Tuesday, Ahsan Iqbal said due to the prudent policies of the government the challenge of terrorism has been overcome and the country has been put on the track of progress and development. He said the menace of terrorism has been overcome and the remnants of terrorism are linked to cross-border activity from Afghanistan.
He said the Government focused on sustainable growth and laid down the roadmap for economic development under the Vision 2025. He said it is important that the economic growth is aligned with social equality and inclusiveness. He said we should set aside political differences and focus on economic revival.
The Minister said Pakistanis are a well equipped generation and collaboration between public and private sector is significant to confront the modern day challenges.
He said efforts for revival of economy and security of the country have been acknowledged internationally as Pakistan is being ranked among top economies by 2030.
Addressing Indian delegates present at the Conference Ahsan Iqbal said that China Pakistan Economic Corridor is a project of connectivity, cooperation and prosperity and not a conspiracy or a security threat.
Earlier in his welcome note the Executive Director of SDPI Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, said the theme of Conference is ‘Seventy Years of Development: Way Forward' under which we will try to measure the milestones achieved so far and ponder over future plan of action.

Spruce Grove Saints captain Josh Harris defined leadership in Game 5 of the Alberta Junior Hockey League Final in Okotoks on Friday.
Harris scored the winning goal at 6:48 of the third period to give Spruce Grove a 3-2 victory against the Okotoks Oilers at the Pason Centennial Arena and claim the AJHL title for the Saints. The Saints won the best-of-seven series 4-1.
“This is unreal. This is just such a great group of guys to do this with. It's really hard to put into words, it's surreal,” expressed Harris. “All of these guys deserve it. We really came together for this. I'm just so happy.”
TJ Lloyd and Chase Olsen also scored for Spruce Grove and Nolan Kent made 17 saves in the win.
Jacob Bernard-Docker and Carson Beers scored for the Oilers and goaltender Riley Morris made 16 saves.
The Saints went into the contest having failed to clinch the series on home ice on April 17, losing 4-1 to the Oilers at the Grant Fuhr Arena.
The Saints took a 3-0 lead in the series having won the first two games in Okotoks 4-3 and 3-2, with both games going to overtime, and then Game 3 3-1 at home on Monday. The Game 4 loss was the only defeat sustained by the Saints in the playoffs.
Okotoks came out strong in Game 5 and took the play to Spruce Grove through the first 10 minutes of the opening period. Forward Quinn Olson came close to giving Okotoks the lead, hitting the inside of the post with a wrist shot from the slot.
Saints coach Bram Stephen called a timeout to calm his troops down, which seemed to benefit as Spruce Grove was able to work their way back into the contest.
“In all three games (in Okotoks), our guys came from behind in the third period. That takes a lot of character a lot of guts and a lot of composure,” said Stephen.
The Saints played the final two games of the series without AJHL MVP and leading scorer Chris Van Os-Shaw. Sidelined with an upper body injury, the prolific scorer had 11 goals in 11 playoff games before being sidelined.
“It obviously sucks to watch but to accomplish this with the boys is a pretty unbelievable feeling right now, our team is unreal. Every guy in the room can play and is an even better person off the ice,” said Van Os-Shaw.
“As of right now I'm taking it day by day but I'm really hoping I'll be back,” he added.
The Saints move on to face the British Columbia Hockey League champion Wenatchee Wild in the Doyle Cup. The series got underway in the Washington state community on Tuesday.
The best-of-seven series winner will represent the Pacific region at the RBC Cup, the junior A national championship, from May 12-20 in Chilliwack, B.C.

He is also a former legal adviser to a number of government bodies.
Today's announcement comes after a heated question period during which the Conservatives peppered the government about who would take over from outgoing commissioner Mary Dawson, who is looking into a conflict-of-interest controversy involving Finance Minister Bill Morneau.
Justin Trudeau and some of his top aides sat out the selection process because Dawson is investigating whether the prime minister broke ethics rules during a vacation to the Aga Khan's private island last Christmas.
Turkey will bid to host the Euro 2024 soccer tournament after three previous unsuccessful attempts, Turkish Football Federation head Yildirim Demiroren said on Wednesday.
The country previously made bids to stage the finals in 2008, 2012 and 2016.
"On this occasion we believe both as a management board and a country that we deserve to get it," Demiroren said at a meeting to announce the candidacy with sports minister Akif Cagatay Kilic.
Turkey will make its official application on March 2, Demiroren added. UEFA will announce all 2024 bidders on March 10 and its decision on the winning bid in September 2018.
The Turkish federation chief highlighted the country's recent investments in stadiums as an asset to their bid.
"Turkey is the only example of a country in Europe or even the world which has made as many as 32 stadium investments in the last few years," Demiroren said.
Turkey will face competition from Germany, the three-time European champions who last staged the tournament in 1988. A Scandinavian bid for 2024 is also likely.
The 2020 tournament will be held across the continent.

To be fair, these guys are catching up and its getting tight. Im really looking forward to a really competitive last half of the season  were really going to have to be on our A game. Fortunately, we got some great points this weekend - it gives us the points lead and weve just got to hold on. Were three for three  no complaints!

KARACHI - Speakers in a meeting on urban narrative –“Karachi calling – raise the Karachi issues. “Karachi is among the dense cities where urban issues are ever increasing,” said architect and planner Arif Hasan while speaking at the two-day programme organised by IBA Literary Society at the Arts Council.
He said 36pc (about 7.5 million) of Karachiites lived in ‘planned' settlements on 77pc of the city's residential plots. “At present Karachi has over 250,000 vacant developed plots and over 68,000 apartments. An additional 600,000 plots are being developed and/or constructed by the formal sector. None of this new development is for low income groups.”
Hasan said 71.32pc people lived on less than 100 square yard plots; 24.27pc on 100-120 sq yds; three per cent on 120-240 sq yds, and 1.47pc lived above 240 square yard plots.
He said people invariably preferred houses to apartments and would like their settlements to be upgraded. This was acceptable to the state till the early part of 2000. However, governments wished to bulldoze the settlements and create medium-size apartment blocks by providing land to developers. “The government's reasoning is that in apartments you can get higher densities and that they give the city a ‘modern look'. Communities view is that they cannot carry out any economic activity in apartments and have problems in organising and financing collective management.”
He spoke at length on the city's transport problems, saying some 35.3pc commuters spent 41 to 60 minutes on way while commuting to work; 13.3pc 18 to 19 minutes and waiting time at bus stops was five to 20 minutes. Transport availability and not job appropriateness determined job preference and they felt insecure while travelling and regularly faced some form of sexual harassment.
Writer, and researcher Akhtar Balouch spoke on the communities, Jews in particular, who migrated from Karachi because of decreasing space for them after Partition.
He said the newly formed nation decided to change names of buildings and streets named after the people who participated in development of Karachi city. The same happened with the monuments and streets related to prominent people from non-Muslim communities.
He said there was a roundabout named Abraham Chowk, which was renamed Ibrahim Chowk, and later Cheel Chowk, in Lyari. “Interestingly, when the roundabout was developed by the authorities they placed a monumental ‘Shaheen' of Allama Iqbal at the centre, which was recognised as cheel [kite] by common citizens.”
Similarly, in Ranchhore Line there was a Synagogue Street, which was ‘converted' to Sharif Shaheed Street.
“Feeling the space in society shrinking for them, the Jews started to migrate to other countries, especially to Israel.”
He gave various references terming the community a peaceful educated and professional. He said there was a (Bani Israil Trust) Magain Shalom Synagogue, a famous building, still remembered by old residents of the area. Now, he added, the building was replaced by a shopping centre.
Amir Farooqi, deputy inspector general of the counterterrorism department of Sindh, spoke on the policing extremism in which he took the example of Saad Aziz, who is convicted for attacking a bus in Safoora Chowrangi and the murder of Sabeen Mahmud.

PanARMENIAN.Net - Chinese smartphone maker Huawei managed to gain ground on Samsung and Apple in terms of market share last year, following the problems encountered by the two sector giants, the Gartner consultancy group said on Wednesday, February 15, according to AFP.
Over the year as a whole, the Chinese maker saw its sales leap by 26.7 percent, while the South Korean and US rivals both saw their sales decline by 4.3 percent, Gartner said in a study.
As result, Huawei was able to increase its share of the smartphone sector to 8.9 percent in 2016 from 7.3 percent a year earlier, while Samsung saw its market share shrink by two full percentage points to 20.5 percent and Apple's contracted to 14.4 percent from 15.9 percent.
"Chinese makers succeeded in winning market share over last year and Huawei now seems to be the main rival to the two giants, even if the gap remains large," Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann told AFP.
Among the other Chinese smartphone makers are OPPO, BBK Communication Equipment (with its One Plus and Vivo brands), ZTE, Xiaomi and Lenovo.
"We're seeing a very real progression compared with earlier years, when the number three maker and the others had struggled to hold on to a market share of more than four percent," Zimmermann said.
"Huawei looks likely to strengthen its position again this year," she added.
In the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, the launch of the iPhone 7 and Samsung's difficulties with its Note 7 model enabled Apple to take top slot in the market with a share of 17.9 percent or 77 million units sold.
Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the October-December period, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, while Huawei sold 40.8 million phones or a market share of 9.5 percent.
"Preliminary data for the current quarter suggest that Samsung will overtake Apple again. But it's remarkable that Apple can hold on to that sort of share of the market with a closed eco-system," the analyst said.
With regard to the different operating systems, Android, which is used by the large majority of smartphone makers, commands a market share of 81.7 percent, while Apple's iOS operating system of its iPhones and iPads accounts for 17.9 percent of the market.
A depot to maintain and service trains for the planned HS2 route is to be built at a logistic and manufacturing park on the edge of Leeds, the Government confirmed today.
The HS2 rolling stock depot east of the city will allow 24-hour maintenance of the high speed trains running from London to Manchester and Yorkshire and create 125 skilled jobs, Department for Transport officials say.
It will be built at the Gateway 45 site, a centre for logistics and manufacturing next to junction 45 of the M1 at Rothwell, after previously being earmarked for the village of Crofton near Wakefield.
A consultation was launched when it emerged that the high speed line would pass to the east of Crofton, rather than the west, and “appeared likely to have a greater impact on the local community”.
New details as HS2 rail bosses reveal next Leeds blueprints
Officials say the new location will reduce the site's environmental impact by cutting the distance empty trains travel for overnight stabling.
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: “Constructing this vital depot in Leeds underlines how the benefits of HS2 drive prosperity right across the UK, with Yorkshire playing a crucial role in maintaining the new high speed trains and delivering significantly better journeys for passengers.
“The depot will act as an economic catalyst, creating skilled jobs, boosting the local economy by unlocking regeneration opportunities and driving continued investment.”
The depot is the latest major development to come for Leeds as part of HS2, with the UK's first dedicated hub for high-speed rail technology also set to be built in the city.
Next stop for plan to bring ‘world-class' high speed rail testing base to Leeds
Leeds City Council leader Judith Blake said they would “make Leeds and the region a global centre for advanced rail and high speed technology”.
She added: “I welcome the news that the HS2 depot will be located at Gateway 45 in Leeds.
“It's now important that through our continued work with HS2 and the Department for Transport that we finalise the proposals for the University of Leeds' Institute for High Speed Rail, which will be world leading in its field, and underpin the continued success of the Leeds City Region Enterprise Zone.
“Taken together, both of these facilities located at Gateway 45 will make Leeds and the region a global centre for advanced rail and high speed technology, further strengthening the economy.
“Leeds City Council are already working with our partners across Leeds City Region to ensure that people will have the right skills and be ready to take advantage of the skilled jobs and other opportunities these developments will bring.”

The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, leaves 10 Downing Street in London after talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May, March 7. (Reuters/Simon Dawson/File)
Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, arrives in Washington on a grand tour of the U.S. this week, seeking to burnish his credentials as a decisive reformer to do business with.
With reports of brutality at home, delays to his plans to transform the economy and a deepening proxy conflict with Iran in neighboring Yemen, the prince's charm offensive to the American capitals of government, finance and entertainment has taken on more urgency.
The prince, 32, will meet Donald Trump on March 20, his first trip to the U.S. since taking over as de facto leader of the world's largest oil exporter. The aim is to strengthen their bond after he rolled out the red carpet for the U.S. president last May in Riyadh. On that visit, both sides played up their mutual interests in containing Iran, tackling Islamic extremists and enhancing business ties.
Since then, things have changed. Prince Mohammed locked up dozens of the Saudi business elite in November for about three months in a declared crackdown on corruption. The kingdom is also likely to delay the sale of a stake in oil giant Aramco until next year. Cuts to government subsidies are proving trickier and there's uncertainty about how the country's ultra-conservatives are reacting to social changes.
Prince Mohammed “will try to convince the U.S. business community that the anti-corruption campaign is not a threat to commercial operations in Saudi Arabia,” said Hani Sabra, founder of New York-based Alef Advisory. “He will play up his social reform agenda to try to repair the image of Saudi Arabia in the U.S. He will advance the narrative that he's the steward that will take the country in a more liberal direction.”
The White House said the visit will strengthen ties between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Prince Mohammed will also dine with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster to discuss $35 billion in business deals, Iran's threat to their interests and the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, according to a National Security Council spokesperson.
There are also companies the Saudis are courting to help shift their economy away from oil. Planned meetings include the heads of Apple Inc. and Google on a tour with likely stops in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston, according to person familiar with the itinerary. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans aren't final.
Saudi officials and those at Apple and Google parent Alphabet Inc., which is in talks with Aramco to jointly build a technology hub in the kingdom, declined to comment.
Prince Mohammed received a boost to his narrative last week when Goldman Sachs Group, an erstwhile adviser to companies and governments in the Middle East, said it would deploy its own money in Saudi Arabia for the first time.
The image of a place to do business, though, took a hit earlier this month.
The New York Times reported on March 11 that 17 of those detained at the Ritz as part of the purge were hospitalized for physical abuse and one later died. Others were stripped of their wealth without due process. The Saudi government has denied that any torture occurred during their detention.
The U.S. is just the latest stop for Prince Mohammed. But his handshakes with the Egyptian leadership and dinner with the British monarchy in recent weeks haven't obscured setbacks in his foreign policy.
The Saudi-led coalition is bogged down in a three-year old war in Yemen. The push last June to isolate Qatar has gone nowhere; indeed, the natural gas producer even managed to improve ties with the U.S., albeit under the outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Yemen loomed large on his trip this month to the U.K. In London, about 100 protesters carried signs near 10 Downing Street denouncing Saudi Arabia's military action. “Do Not Welcome Killers” was written next to a picture of Prince Mohammed.
His foreign policy “will raise questions among senior officials of the Trump administration and other governments about his ability to achieve his goals,” said James M. Dorsey, a Middle East specialist at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. “The New York Times report will also likely make foreign investors even more hesitant than they have been since the November purge.”
The public relations machine is in full swing. Ahead of the prince's visit to the U.K., Saudi Arabia advertised around London with placards declaring “he is creating a new, vibrant Saudi Arabia.”
He can also count on the support of liberal Saudis who like the social changes he is bringing about: the right for women to drive, and more entertainment.
The enthusiasm for change was on display at a gallery in London, where Saudis in western attire and their European fans sipped fresh juices and surveyed work from some of the kingdom's leading artists.
“We are trying to give the viewer a picture more whole about Saudi Arabia,” Raneem Zaki Farsi, the curator of the exhibition, said as musicians played classical Arabic music. “We created a narrative through the art works that gives the viewer more aspects about the kingdom. This is just the beginning.”
There was also a financial dividend, one the Saudi government will be keen to advance further in the U.S. It signed about $2.1 billion in deals with Britain, including one between Aramco and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. The kingdom also signed a memorandum of intent with the British government to purchase fighter jets.
The key now for the crown prince is to cement his relationship with the Trump administration and bring that message home, said Paul Pillar, a former CIA officer who's know a professor at Georgetown University.
“Most Saudis realize that continued support from, and close relations with, the U.S. are in Saudi interests,” he said. “A demonstrated adeptness in handling the relationship with Washington can cancel out some other policy setbacks, either foreign or domestic.”
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Islamic State fighters holding a small district in Damascus have gained some ground after driving out Syrian army units that moved into a neighbouring area that rebels abandoned last week, a war monitor said.
In fighting that lasted 24 hours, the ultra-hardline militant group killed 36 Syrian soldiers, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Syrian army could not immediately be reached for comment.
The district of al-Qadam lies in the Syrian capital's southern suburbs and has not been part of the month-long offensive waged by the army against rebels in eastern Ghouta.
It is located next to the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, a scene of fierce fighting early in the seven-year conflict.
Last week, rebels that had held part of Qadam for years quit the district for opposition areas in northern Syria under an evacuation deal with the government, allowing the army to move in.
However, the Islamic State group that had held a separate part of Qadam, and had sporadically fought the rebels there, launched an assault to take the area they had vacated.
Islamic State has lost almost all its territory in Syria after two rival offensives last year by the Syrian army, backed by Russia and Iran, and an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias backed by the United States.
It now controls only the small pocket in Qadam, a patch of territory in southwest Syria near the borders with Jordan and Israel, and two small areas of desert on each side of the Euphrates near the border with Iraq.
When the Philadelphia Flyers stepped up to the podium and selected six-foot-six defenseman Samuel Morin from the Rimouski Oceanic at 11th overall in 2013, there were some mixed reviews. Some people immediately thought Chris Pronger 2.0, while others were left scratching their heads.
If you look at his makeup, standing nearly seven feet tall and weighing in over 200 pounds, you can see where the Pronger comparisons come from. Like Pronger, he is a towering force and a player that you keep your head up against.
On the opposite side of the coin, skeptics said his foot speed was an issue and he was simply too slow to be an effective NHL defenseman. If you look at the direction that the league is going, players are getting smaller and quicker. He held his own in juniors, but the question is, will his game transition well to the new NHL or will he be left behind?
This season has been rough as he has dealt with some injury trouble. He's been limited to two games this season with the Flyers and only 15 with the Lehigh Valley Phantoms. The hope is that it won't affect his development and that he can have a strong finish to the season.
Heads Up, Seven Up
Players have quickly realized that you have to have your head on a swivel Morin is out there on the ice. He is like a shark hunting for fresh blood. He's not afraid to step up and make the big hit, which is where some of the liabilities in his early career have come from. He needs to be smarter with picking his spots. There are times when you can step up and deliver the big hit but there are also situations that call for a simple poke check.
In order to be an effective player and a solid defenseman, Morin needs to keep the sand paper in his game. It instills fear in the opposing players often causing turnovers or giveaways when he plays it right. He is an effective net clearing presence and goalies love when he is around, as long as his big frame doesn't alter their view of the puck. Goalies also like having Morin on the ice because nobody gets away with free shots at the goalies hands or pads – and if they do they get a face full of Morin.
There have been glimpses of the great player that Morin can be. Those are the games when he makes smart plays like good breakout passes from the defensive zone, clearing the net, making smart hits, using his reach to his advantage and getting pucks on net. When Morin is on his game, he keeps things simple and opponents are aware of his presence.
Morin's Not Afraid of the ‘Fisticuffs'
Search YouTube for Samuel Morin and you're sure to find a great fight. Whether it be from his days in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) or from his couple years of professional hockey with the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, they're all entertaining. Maybe more entertaining for us than the opponent that is getting dragged across the ice, but nonetheless entertaining. He's a man among boys and you can't help but feel bad for the players that cross him.
In juniors, players trying to make an impact on their teams would challenge him because they wanted to show they weren't afraid to take on the biggest guy on the team. Many of them quickly found out that that was a mistake. He put up over 100 penalty minutes (PIM) in two of his four seasons with Rimouski and over 50 in the other two. He also put up over 100 PIM in each of his first two seasons with Lehigh Valley — but, if you look at this year's totals, he is sitting at only 26 PIM through 15 games played showing his maturity level.
The Reincarnation of Pronger?
Looking at him out on the ice you can't help but get flashbacks of Pronger. He's a towering force who no one wants to mess with. Players are afraid to go head-to-head with him in the corners and often cough up the puck because they're overthinking when he is on the ice. If you touch his goalie or one of his teammates he is not afraid to take care of business.
The Flyers have missed this type of presence over the years. A guy who is going to take a penalty from time to time just because he plays on the line. You can accept those penalties when they're warranted but not when they're bone-headed plays. If he gets an instigator for protecting a teammate then so be it. This type of player can cause a coach to scratch his head but you know they always have the team's best interest in mind.
While he may not carry the leadership qualities or the offensive skills that Pronger did, Morin is going to be a solid stay at home defenseman. He's the kind of player that fans have to manage expectations on. He is not going to be an impact player when it comes to the scoreboard. You will know Morin had a strong game by not hearing his name.
Unless the Flyers fall out of contention this season or they have a few injuries on the back end, Morin is most likely not going to get the call to the NHL. This is a smart move by Dave Hakstol because the extra year of seasoning in the AHL is going to pay dividends when next season rolls around. With Brandon Manning's contract coming up at the end of the season, this could be the roster spot that Morin wins in the 2018-19 season. One thing is for sure — Morin is not intimidated by anything. He has a Broad Street Bully mentality that is sure to make him a fan favourite and a solid defenseman for years to come.
BOSTON - The last 24 hours have moved at a breakneck pace for Ryan Donato, but the Scituate native is doing whatever he can to sit back and enjoy the moment.
Just a few days removed from skating with Harvard in the ECAC semifinals, Donato took the next step in his promising hockey career Sunday night -- signing an entry-level contract with the Boston Bruins.
For Donato, a hometown product and son of former Bruins forward Ted Donato, getting the opportunity to suit up for the Black and Gold is a childhood dream finally realized.
"It's a whirlwind experience right now," Donato said after Boston's morning skate Monday at Warrior Ice Arena. "Obviously, it's pretty crazy. I'm really excited and it's something that I don't want to happen too fast so I can cherish every second of it. ... It's a dream come true. Even going on out there for a skate, it just didn't feel real yet."
Monday stood as Donato's first reps at the pro level, but the 21-year-old forward is expected to be thrown right into the fire and make his NHL debut that night against the Columbus Blue Jackets.
Donato skated on a line with Brian Gionta and Noel Acciari during practice while also getting looks on the team's first power-play unit alongside David Pastrnak, Rick Nash, Torey Krug and Brad Marchand.
"I'm sure he's going to be a little bit nervous, excited," Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy said of Donato. "He will start on the left wing. He skated with Gionta and Acciari this morning. ... That's where he'll start. Who knows where he'll finish. ... . He'll see time on the power play and again, until we know what we got there, we'll plan accordingly how many minutes he gets and where we go from there."
A proven scorer with a quick and accurate release, Donato has the potential to bring some instant offense to a Bruins club currently dealing with a number of injuries up front. The reigning ECAC Hockey Player of the Year scored 26 goals in just 29 games this winter while playing for his father at Harvard.
"Just work hard," Donato said of his father's message to him. "It's a job now. It's still fun, but there's a side to it where you have to perform. For me, I know that now."
Donato put himself on the map earlier this winter as the breakout star for Team USA at the 2018 Winter Olympics, tying for most goals at the Games with five goals over five games.
"I saw him score five goals there," Cassidy said of his impressions of Donato during the Olympics. "That's what I'd like to see more of here, to be honest with you. Impressions are is that he played with men at a higher level."
While international hockey is a bit of a different style when compared to NHL hockey, Donato hopes that his strong showing at the Olympics will be just the springboard he needs to make an immediate impact with the Bruins.
"You're playing on the world's biggest stage," Donato said. "It's good for dealing with here and I think playing against guys and great competition. I think that's something that I was excited about and I did well over there and I was happy with the way I played. Hopefully it can translate to the NHL game as well."
(Reuters) - Fired FBI director James Comey's memoir that details his private meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump sold some 600,000 copies in all formats in its first week, its publisher said on Tuesday, the latest in a series of best-selling political books.

Comey's “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,” has so far outpaced Hillary Clinton's campaign memoir “What Happened” and journalist Michael Wolff's behind-the-scenes White House expose “Fire and Fury” in opening week sales, according to industry figures.
Publisher Flatiron Books, a division of privately-owned Macmillan, said it has printed more than 1 million copies of Comey's book, which has made national headlines.
Flatiron did not say whether the first week sales were global or limited to the United States.
Comey has been on a media blitz, sitting for numerous television and radio interviews, while also on a book tour that has seen him appear before sold-out audiences of more than a thousand.
The book has drawn Trump's ire as Comey compared the president to a mob boss who stresses personal loyalty over the law and has little regard for morality or truth.

Trump dismissed Comey in May last year while the FBI was investigating allegations Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between Russians and Trump's campaign.
Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion.
“A Higher Loyalty,” which is billed as Comey's thoughts on leadership, was atop Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) bestseller list for several weeks before its release.
Clinton's “What Happened” sold more than 300,000 copies, including hardcover, e-book, CD and digital audio, in its first week after publication in September 2017, according to CBS Corp-owned (CBS.N) publisher Simon & Schuster.
Wolff's portrayal of a disorganized West Wing filled with strife and aides questioning the president's fitness to lead debuted in January with some 28,000 in sales. Higher-than-expected demand led Macmillan imprint Henry Holt & Co to order up 2.1 million copies in its first week.
Wolff's book has sold nearly 975,000 print copies, and Clinton's memoir has sold some 511,000 total print copies, according to NPD BookScan.
Just when you thought every element of your childhood has made a comeback, Blink-182 announced its Las Vegas residency. On Monday, March 19, the pop-punk trio announced that they'll be kicking off a series of concerts at the Palms Casino Resort beginning on Memorial Day. But if this is the sort of news that makes you want to blast "What's My Age Again?" then don't sleep on it. Because unlike the Vegas residencies you might have in mind, the Kings of the Weekend residency will be a limited edition.
Fellow '90s mainstays like Britney Spears and Celine Dion have set up shop on the Las Vegas strip and have performed for years. Spears' Piece of Me residency extended over four years and 250 performances with a second residency reportedly in the works, and Dion's Celine began in 2011 and is still ongoing due to popular demand, performing an incredible 70 shows a year. In contrast, Blink-182's run will be decidedly shorter, with just 16 performances currently scheduled throughout the Summer and Fall 2018.
According to E! News, the Kings of The Weekend residency premiere on May 26 and perform every weekend in June, then take a break until the last weekend of October, when they'll have their final shows in early November before wrapping on Nov. 17.
So if you're a fan of Mark Hoppus' bass and vocals, Travis Barker's tattoos and drum-playing, and Matt Skiba's skills on the guitar, you should waste no time in securing your tickets. They'll go on sale Friday for the show and the press release described the show as the following:
"Blurring the line between rock, punk and pop, Blink-182 with Mark Hoppus (vocals/bass), Travis Barker (drums) and Matt Skiba (guitar), will bring its nearly 25-year history of hit songs, inappropriate tales, and nonsensical antics to life in Kings of the Weekend."
It's a relief to see that rosters aside, not much has changed in the band's 25-year history. They'll still be their reliably punk selves, just classed up a little bit. It is Vegas, after all, and the Californian band is stepping into some pretty big shoes with this residency. But Hoppus is confident that they're more than up to the task of filling them, as he reassured fans in the wake of the Mar. 19 announcement.
"When the Palms asked us to do a residency here in Vegas, we said 'Absolutely!' Now, we just have to cast our show girls, create our set list — a true throwback of Vegas classics with Sinatra, Liberace. Maybe we can even marry someone on stage...The possibilities in Vegas are endless."
The only possibility that doesn't seem to be on the table in Vegas is for a reunion with former co-lead vocalist and guitarist Tom DeLonge. If you were searching for his name in the mix, then you're sadly out of luck, not to mention behind the times.
DeLonge parted ways with the band in 2015. A statement from Hoppus and Barker that was released to Radio.com in January 2015 stated the following:
"We were all set to play [Musink Music and Tattoo Festival in March 2015] and record a new album and Tom [DeLonge] kept putting it off without reason. A week before we were scheduled to go in to the studio we got an email from his manager explaining that he didn't want to participate in any Blink-182 projects indefinitely, but would rather work on his other non-musical endeavors. No hard feelings but the show must go on for our fans."
And go on it has — the band replaced DeLonge with Alkaline Trio's Skiba, and the change-up hasn't seemed to cramp their style. Exactly the opposite, in fact, if this residency is any indication. So while you can't expect the ex-Blink-182 guitarist to take the stage with his former band, it sounds like everything else will be exactly how you remembered. Right down to all the small things — we did it again! — like your parents totally not understanding what you see in these guys, but you'll always love them anyway.
Chelsea Clinton is about to tell you some things you may not know about her. In an interview with Variety, she lists the last great movie she saw (“Hidden Figures”), her most surprising job (an internship at a cattle ranch in 1999), and her favorite food growing up (cheddar cheese). But when asked to name one more secret, she pauses, stumped for a moment.
“I am not running for public office,” she finally says, with a smile.
Marco Grob for Variety
The declaration ends months of speculation in the press about her political prospects. Clinton, 37, isn't following in the footsteps of her parents — Bill and Hillary, in case you're from Neptune. But she's still got a full plate as she fights for the causes that are important to her, including the Alliance for a Healthier Generation.
Clinton serves as the vice chair of the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit that her father started in 2001 to encourage leadership and improve health conditions worldwide. She's also an adjunct professor in public health at Columbia University. She's an author (“It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired & Get Going”). She's a staunch advocate for child-health issues, and she's become a vocal opponent of Donald Trump's policies, expressing her strong views daily on Twitter.
She's also fostered ties to the entertainment industry. In 2014, she produced a documentary short, “Of Many,” about an imam and a rabbi who find friendship in New York City for the Tribeca Film Festival. That same year, as part of the foundation's Too Small to Fail initiative, she met with showrunners from “Orange Is the New Black” and “Days of Our Lives,” among other series, to urge them to write characters that promote reading or singing to young children. “Chelsea was key to coming up with the idea,” says Maura Pally, the senior vice president of programs at the Clinton Foundation. “She helped us convene a group to galvanize the Hollywood community.”
Clinton spent much of last year on the campaign trial, stumping for her mom. But she's now returned full-time to Manhattan, where she lives with her two young kids — Charlotte, 2, and Aidan, 10 months — and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky. She spoke to Variety about how she's making her voice heard in 2017.
What message do you have for the 66 million people who voted for your mom?
Everything that took you to the polls that day, hopefully takes you to the streets, takes you to social media, takes you into conversations at work, at home, wherever you may be — to talk about what's really at risk in this moment. Because I think everything is at risk. Our fundamental rights, our fundamental security, are at risk. If you also believe that, raise your voice and help others raise their voices. If we don't, we're going to have a country that doesn't look like the country that we live in today. This is not the time to be silent or stay on the sidelines.
As someone who traveled across the country campaigning, were you surprised at the sexism that still exists?
I'm not surprised. I'm deeply saddened. I think it's important for us to realize we can't take progress for granted. Progress has to be continually defended as well as advanced. I think about this multiple times a day. It's 2017, and we're fighting again on fights that were settled a few years ago around gay rights, women's reproductive health; fights to ensure we're a country that's always moving toward a more perfect union and not moving toward disunion, disunity, and segregation. We're really in peril of moving backward. That's not what I want for my children and their generation.
Given the current political climate, what do you see as your responsibilities?
I think it's a question all of us should be asking ourselves every day. I think being a citizen isn't just what happens when there's an election. For me, I'm deeply committed to the work of the foundation. I'm committed to my teaching at Columbia. I'm committed to raising my voice in opposition to and affirmation of, when I think it's important to do so. We know the majority of our country doesn't support what's happening. We need to make it clear that we're not the silent majority.
What's the mission of the Clinton Foundation?
At its most distilled level, we try to make a positive, impactful, empowering difference in whatever ways we can. It's the story of any of our programmatic work over time, whether we're thinking about global health, climate change, the work we've done for women and girls. That will continue to be our story in the future. I'm really excited about the next chapter.
There's been so much confusion as a result of the 2016 campaign.
The strangest part has been the cognitive dissonance that seems to exist between the perception around the foundation for people who don't know our work, and the actual work. I wish that most of the coverage had been factual, and had paid attention to what GuideStar, Charity Watch, or our tax filings said. I hope now that we're out of the political season, there will be more focus on the work.
Was it frustrating to see the foundation attacked?
Of course. The lies were absolutely frustrating because the facts didn't seem sufficient to put them to rest. I think that was so odd about the whole experience — either the truth was insufficient or people just didn't care. And, really, I am so grateful to everyone who works at the foundation, who just kept doing their work.
Where does your empowerment come from?
At the moment, I find empowerment, inspiration, and, in the best sense, obligation from my children. I didn't know I could care any more intensely about all the things I already cared about until I became a mom and found out that I could.
What's the best advice you ever received about balancing your career?
I think the best advice I ever received was from my mom. Maybe it isn't so much advice, as just the example that she set for me growing up, where I certainly saw her work hard, but I never doubted I was the most important person in her life. She talked to me about what she was doing, how her work connected to our life. And so now, even though my kids are super young, I talk to them about the work I'm doing.
Teaching kids to eat right has been an important issue for you. What were your favorite foods growing up?
My parents did a frustratingly good job, particularly my mom, of ensuring I liked healthy food, because those were really the only foods they let me eat. I wasn't allowed to have sugar cereal. We only had dessert on the weekends or special occasions. I also loved cheese, so the healthy foods I wasn't maybe so thrilled about, my mother just melted cheese on top of broccoli until I learned to love broccoli.
How do you get your news?
My husband, Marc, and I still subscribe to old-fashioned newspapers. We get The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and the FT. I also read online. I listen to the BBC World Service every morning.
What about Facebook?
I do some Facebook. But I spend more time on Twitter.
There's been so much attention recently to your Twitter feed.
I did hundreds of events last year, and hundreds of interviews. And throughout the campaign, when I was asked questions like, “What do you think we have to lose?” I would say, “Everything.” I don't think my tone has changed or the substance of what I'm saying has changed. I've recognized, as a lot of people have, that Twitter is a vehicle for me to share my thoughts.
Do you still like action movies?
I love action movies. Of course I'm going to see “Furious 8.” I've already seen “Logan.” I love that Logan is being succeeded by a little girl.

Poet Imagines Life Inside A 1910 Institution That Eugenics Built
Enlarge this image toggle caption Kristin Teston/Persea Kristin Teston/Persea
Growing up in southwestern Virginia in recent decades, poet Molly McCully Brown often passed by a state institution in Amherst County that was once known as the "Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded."
Since 1983 the facility, which was founded in 1910, has been called the Central Virginia Training Center, and it is now a residential home for people with various intellectual disabilities. But in the early 20th century, the place Brown now refers to as "the colony" was part of the eugenics movement taking hold in the U.S., and a variety of treatments now considered inhumane were practiced there — including forced sterilization. Brown, who has cerebral palsy, notes that had she been born in an earlier era, she might have been sent to live at the institution herself.
"It is impossible to know that for sure," she says. "I can look at my life and look at my family and look at my parents and think, No, never. That never would have happened. But I also understand that if I had been born 50 years earlier, the climate was very different."
She hopes to give voice to those early generations of residents, in her book of poetry, The Virginia State Colony For Epileptics And Feebleminded.
For Brown, the themes of disability and poetry have been constant throughout her life: "In my life, there has always been my body in some state of falling apart or disrepair or attempting to be fixed, and there has always been poetry. And I couldn't untwine those things if I tried."
Interview Highlights
On seeing the buildings and grounds of the old facility
It was incredibly moving and incredibly powerful. The place is interesting because it is still an operational facility for adults with really serious disabilities, although it is in the process of closing. But like a lot of things in Virginia, it was initially built on an enormous amount of land. And, so, a really interesting thing happened, which is that as the buildings that were originally part of the colony fell into disrepair, they were largely just moved out of — and new buildings were built on accompanying land, but those original buildings were not necessarily torn down. So the place itself is this really strange combination of functioning facility and ghost town of everything that it has been. I've never been in a place that felt more acutely haunted in my life.
On how some people assume her physical disability means she also has an intellectual disability
We do have a strange tendency in this country to equate any kind of disability with less intellectual capability and with even a less complete humanity. Certainly as a child and as a teenager — and even now as an adult — [I] encountered people who assumed that just because I used a wheelchair, maybe I couldn't even speak to them. I often get questions directed at people I'm with, as opposed to me, and that's a really interesting phenomenon.
On the connection between poetry and theology
Both poetry and theology for me are about paying attention to the world in a very intentional way, and about admitting a mystery that is bigger than anything that I rationally understand. ... I think poetry has always been for me a kind of prayer. So those things feel very linked for me. And, again, poetry does feel like the first — and in some ways best — language I ever had for mystery and for my sense of what exists beyond the world we're currently living in.
On how Catholicism has helped her accept her body
One of the things that I find so moving about Catholicism is that it never forgets that to be a person is inherently and inescapably and necessarily to be in a body — a body that brings you pain, a body that brings you pleasure, a body that can be a barrier to thinking more completely about your life and your soul — but [that it] can also be a vehicle to delivering you into better communion with the world, with other people and to whatever divinity it is that you believe in.
What Catholicism did for me, in part, is give me a framework in which to understand my body as not an accident or a punishment or a mistake, but as the body that I am meant to have and that is constitutive of so much of who I am and what I've done and what I hope I will do in the world.
More and more ... I've come to see my body as a place of pride and potential, and as something that gives me a unique outlook onto the world. And I'd rather that, I guess, than be infuriated by it.
On her twin sister, who died shortly after birth
She lived about 36 hours after we were born. ... It's a phenomenon in my life that I have not a lot of rational explanation for, ... but it is true that I miss my sister with a kind of intense specificity that has no rational explanation, and that I feel aware of her presence in this way that I can't exactly explain or articulate, but which feels undeniable to me. ...
I do think that that sort of gave me no other option than to believe in some kind of something beyond this current mortal life that we're living. Because what is the explanation otherwise for the fact that I feel like I miss and I know this person who only lived a matter of hours? And for the fact as much as I know that she is dead and is gone in a real way, she doesn't feel "disappeared" to me.
On how her physical disability and her poetry are intertwined
I think the easiest way I have of describing it is I have two [early] memories. ... One of them is of sitting on a table in a hospital room in the children's hospital in St. Louis, choosing the flavor of the anesthetic gas I was going to breathe when they put me under to do my first major surgery. I was picking between cherry and butterscotch and grape. And the second memory that I have is of my father reading a Robert Hayden poem called "Those Winter Sundays."

Billie Lourd has spoken out for the first time since the death of her mother.
And her grandmother.
The child of Carrie Fisher, Lourd stunningly and tragically lost both loved ones over the course of 24 hours last week; first when Fisher passed away from a heart attack and then when Reynolds died from a stroke.
It was a shocking and heartbreaking turn of events.
Fans have been sending their condolences to Lourd ever since, wishing all the best to the Scream Queens 2 star in this impossibly challenging time period.
And now Lourd has acknowledges their messages.
“Receiving all of your prayers and kind words over the past week has given me strength during a time I thought strength could not exist,” Lourd wrote on Instagram.
She added:
“There are no words to express how much I will miss my Abadaba and my own and only Momby. Your love and support means the world to me.”
As you can see below, Lourd included a photo of herself as a child with the post.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday banned the export of weapons and defence services to South Sudan, stepping up pressure against President Salva Kiir to end the country's four-year civil war.
While the United States does not conduct arms sales with South Sudan, the move prevents any U.S. company or citizen from providing military equipment or defence services to the country's warring factions.
The unilateral arms embargo was another signal that Washington is losing patience with South Sudan's leaders after repeated agreements to end the violence. The war has been marked by brutal attacks against civilians, which has sparked the region's biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
In South Sudan's capital Juba, Kiir's spokesperson Ateny Wek Ateny declined to comment.
The Trump administration has pressed neighbouring countries and African groups, such as the eight-member Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), to sanction South Sudanese officials who undermine the peace process.
The State Department said in a statement it would amend the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) to reflect the arms ban on South Sudan. Other countries on the blacklist include Belarus, China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Venezuela.
OFFICIALS SANCTIONED
Some top officials close to Kiir have already been sanctioned by the United States, including the once-powerful army chief Paul Malong, who was later fired and forced into exile when he quarrelled with the president.
The African Union on Monday said it was open to impose sanctions on leaders violating ceasefires in South Sudan, joining a chorus of officials who say those prolonging the conflict must be punished.
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the U.N. Security Council last week it was time to impose a U.N. arms embargo on South Sudan. Haley visited South Sudan in late October and met with Kiir.
The Obama administration had failed to convince the United Nations to back an arms embargo in 2016.

Any U.S. push for the U.N. Security Council to take further action against South Sudan is likely to be resisted by veto power Russia. The council, however, sanctioned several senior South Sudanese officials on both sides of the conflict in 2015.
“The time has come to acknowledge the hard reality that the leaders of South Sudan are not just failing their people, they are betraying them. And so this Council is at a crossroads,” Haley told the council last Wednesday. “We cannot stand by idly as innocent civilians are murdered and raped.”
Brian Adeba of the Enough Project, a Washington-based policy group fighting to prevent genocide and atrocities, said a weapons ban would be more effective if it was imposed by a group of countries, including some in Africa.
“A unilateral action risks being symbolic,” he said, adding, “However, we believe that the United States should not just restrict this to an arms embargo, but should escalate this by enacting more targeted financial pressures.”
WAR
Oil-rich South Sudan has been wrecked by civil war since 2013, when troops loyal to Kiir clashed with troops loyal to then-Vice President Riek Machar.
The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives since then, slashed oil production and driven about a third of the population of 12 million from their homes.
The European Union imposed an arms embargo on Sudan in 1994, which was amended to also apply to South Sudan when the country gained independence from Sudan in 2011.
Independent U.N. experts have reported to the U.N. Security Council that South Sudan's government has spent millions of dollars on weapons as the country slid into famine and an economic crisis.
In January 2016, U.N. experts reported that sources had told them: “Uganda either supplies South Sudan with its own stock or acquires the weapons and then transfers them to South Sudan, without necessarily involving or obtaining the consent of the primary seller.”
Last year, the U.N. experts said: “Weapons continue to flow into South Sudan from diverse sources, often with the coordination of neighbouring countries.”
Most of us would have to look up the name of J.D. Tippit. He was the Dallas police officer shot and killed in 1963, when he tried to apprehend the man who assassinated President Kennedy. Or Tim McCarthy, the Secret Service agent who took a bullet fired at President Reagan in 1981.
But Norman Mailer, one of America's great authors, wrote a massive biography of the man who shot J.D. Tippit and John F. Kennedy. Every aspect of the life of the man who shot Tim McCarthy has been followed for years. Both men, with blood from history on their hands, are featured as characters in a Stephen Sondheim musical.
The men who committed mass murder in Charleston, Newtown and Orlando became household names for weeks. Murderers can become famous. People who save lives can be footnotes.
As much of America woke to the news this week of the killings in Las Vegas, Zeynep Tufekci, the social scientist who writes on communications technology, and is often a guest on Weekend Edition, took to Twitter to caution:
"Media: the next potential mass shooter is watching the current media coverage intently. Right now. Your coverage is a factor in this crisis."
She went on to say that mass coverage that replays sounds and screams, scours a shooter's life for telling details, and searches out their old lovers, co-workers, and childhood friends, can fire feverish minds who begin to see killing as an avenue to fame, in a world where they've felt overlooked.
"As proof," she wrote, "simply look at recent rise of using cars as weapons. Painfully and openly obvious for decades, only took off recently. Contagion."
Journalists, myself included, often react badly to this argument. The public has a right to know, and the press has a duty to report, every aspect of such public and appalling crimes, though maybe not over and over again, and in every terrifying detail. Maybe we can minimize the superlatives of destruction that rank shootings — most, worst, biggest. Many news organizations have truly tried in recent years to repeat a killer's name less, and to report more on the lives of those he killed.
But the media are now more plural. People can get news these days, or what they think is news, from hackers, amateurs, hoaxers and just a man or woman on the other side of the world with a smartphone and no worries about how to responsibly report a mass shooting. And this monstrous crime is committed in America every few weeks.
HALIFAX—A hockey tournament taking place in Dartmouth later this month will be a midsummer dream for fans. The fifth annual Jordan Boyd Celebrity Hockey Challenge will feature some well-known faces, including NHL All-Star James Neal who was recently traded from the Las Vegas Knights to the Calgary Flames.

The July 28 tournament at the new Dartmouth 4 Pad Arena will raise funds for the QEII Foundation. The event honours the life of Jordan Boyd, who died due to an undiagnosed heart disease at the age of 16 while attending a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League training camp. In total, 10 teams will play alongside professional hockey players drafted to each team by order of their fundraising efforts. The event highlight is a celebrity all-star game for fans, where professional hockey players and the top fundraisers are split on to two teams. In addition to Neal, other well-known Canadian hockey stars will take to the ice for the event.

Team Canada's Olympic Silver Medallist Jill Saulnier will be the first female athlete to participate in the tournament. A press release from the QEII Foundation said Boston Bruins' Brad Marchand and Team Canada's World Junior Goaltender, Ben Scrievens will also join “a star-studded roster of NHL and AHL players.” The one-day tournament has raised $560,000 net over the past five years in support of prevention of sudden death from cardiac arrest through the QEII's Inherited Heart Disease Clinic. Earlier this month, the Boyd family, in partnership with Emergency Health Services and its EHS AED Registry program, presented the Milford Recreation Association with an AED purchased with funds from the JBCHC. Another portion of the tournament's proceeds recently helped bring the Mayo Clinic's Dr. Michael Ackerman, a cardiologist and world leader in genetic heart conditions, to the QEII Health Sciences Centre to work with local heart health staff and to share cutting-edge expertise.

Pandora announced today it has appointed Roger Lynch as its new president and CEO.
Lynch was the founding CEO of Dish's Sling TV previous to the move. He will also become a member of Pandora's board of directors, along with Snap Inc.'s Michael Lynton.
Naveen Chopra was serving as Pandora's interim CEO after Tim Westergren, Pandora's former CEO, announced he was stepping down from all official positions.
Lynch's new position comes just as Pandora has launched a rebranding effort to focus on conversion of free users to paying customers. The company started to see a climb this year in Q2 for its efforts, topping revenue targets and closing at 4.86 million total paid subscribers, sending shares up more than 7 percent in extended trading.
Pandora has seen a steady decline in the number of active users since 2014, when about 81.5 million people were actively using the service on a monthly basis. That number now stands at 76 million (compare that to Spotify's 140 million active monthly users, 50 million of whom are paying customers).
The addition of Lynch and board inclusion of Lynton, who ran Sony Pictures before joining Snap, could signal Pandora is thinking about getting into video in the future.
Lynch will begin his new appointment on September 18, 2017.
*An earlier version of this article mistakenly mentioned Robert Lynch in the headline as the new CEO of Pandora. It is Roger Lynch. We regret the error.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The New York Giants are "disappointed" in cornerback Eli Apple, and he could face discipline for tweeting during Sunday's loss to the Dallas Cowboys at MetLife Stadium.
Apple, the 10th overall pick last year, was inactive for the fourth straight game. He responded to a tweet asking why he wasn't playing with, "I'm too healthy" and an emoji of a man with his hands in the air. He also retweeted a tweet that praised Cowboys running back Rod Smith for icing the Giants with an 81-yard touchdown reception in the fourth quarter.
Apple and Smith both went to Ohio State.
"I had a conversation with Eli about that. I was disappointed," interim coach Steve Spagnuolo said. "I told him I was disappointed. We'll decide exactly what we do with it. He apologized. We move on from that."

Apple declined to talk after the game, saying he wasn't allowed to speak.
Spagnuolo said he knew only that Apple had tweeted during the game, not the contents of the tweet. Veteran cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie wasn't aware of the situation at all until he was asked by the media on Monday.
"I didn't know about it. He tweeted during the game. What did he say?" Rodgers-Cromartie asked. "Pshhh. That is a tough one there. I don't know. They probably have that kind of connection. But to do it during the game, that is probably bad timing."
It has been a tumultuous season for Apple, the second-year cornerback who started the Giants' first three games this season. He was originally benched for reportedly having a shouting match with his position coach. Apple also had to miss a couple of days of practice as he dealt with a personal issue related to the health of a family member.
The hits seemed to keep on coming. Apple missed two practices last week as he was dealing with hip and back injuries.
Spagnuolo said Apple didn't get enough reps in practice throughout the week to play against the Cowboys. Spagnuolo said the plan is for him to return to the field this week when the Giants host the Philadelphia Eagles.
"Look, we need to get you going. Everybody wants you here helping us out," Spagnuolo said he told the young cornerback, who the Giants had high hopes for entering this season.
"But this wasn't the week to do it. He didn't get enough reps during the week. But he did get some on Friday; I just didn't think it was enough to have him ready to do the things we were going to do with the defensive game plan.
"He understood that. The goal there, after we shook hands and hugged, was to get him up and running next week."
Apple, 22, has been the subject of much discussion this season. One source told ESPN that he's disliked within the organization. Another source described him as "being in the doghouse." That makes sense, given he has been shelved the past four weeks and has started only seven games this season.
The Giants have been in no rush for Apple to return despite starting Ross Cockrell and Brandon Dixon at cornerback, with Rodgers-Cromartie playing the slot.
"He's cool with me because I understand. I used to be that guy. You feel me?" Rodgers-Cromartie said. "When you're going through stuff sometimes you don't know how to act out, so you act a certain way. I get that. It takes someone to hone in and make you feel loved.
"But the other point is it's a profession. You've got guys in here that is professional and strictly about their business. So if it seems like a guy isn't doing what he's asked to do, it rubs them the wrong way. I just understand it."
Rodgers-Cromartie tries to stay in Apple's ear. He knows from firsthand experience what the young cornerback is dealing with this season. Rodgers-Cromartie had his own personal struggles early in his career and is on his fourth NFL team despite being a Pro Bowl corner.
He said Apple doesn't want to leave the Giants but does have enough talent and tape to get a second chance even if something goes awry.
"I don't want to see him go down that path. I try to stay on him," Rodgers-Cromartie said.
Is he headed in the right direction?
"It's hard to tell," Rodgers-Cromartie said. "I can say he comes in here in the right mindset and comes in and puts his stuff on and goes out there and practices. He does what is asked of him. I think for the most part he gets it."
Shares in IPL Plastics dipped in their first hours of trading yesterday after the company completed its Canadian IPO.
Shares were down more than 1.3pc after the first three and a half hours, with IPL having raised CAD$178.2m (€116m) as part of the deal.
The company plans to use acquisitions to expand its manufacturing footprint into new countries, chief executive Alan Walsh said in Canada yesterday.
Europe and North America are the company's two main areas of focus for future expansion, given that IPL has no manufacturing presence in continental Europe, Mr Walsh said.
Felix Wilson the former President of the Dominica Olympic Committee (DOC) was escorted out of a Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) meeting in Miami on Tuesday.
DNO understands that Wilson had booked his flight to the meeting prior to the DOC election which saw him booted out of the position of President.
DNO further understands that after the election, the new DOC canceled the ticket and informed PASO of the new executive.
DNO was told that it was most surprising that Wilson was present at the meeting together with the new DOC President, Billy Doctrove, which caused shame and embarrassment for Dominica.
Wilson, who was attempting to get accreditation to the meeting, was eventually escorted out.
He was kicked out as President of the DOC after a long drawn out and bitter battle on May 18. He has since cried foul saying politics and nepotism were involved in him losing the position.
The romance between venture capitalists and dating startups appears to have hit a rocky patch.
VC investment in the space declined over the past year, with smaller average rounds and fewer funded companies, according to Crunchbase company profile data. In particular, U.S.-based startups saw meager funding, with less than $7 million invested in early-stage prospects that described themselves as dating companies.
Globally, disclosed venture, seed and growth funding for self-described dating companies totaled around $47 million for the past 12 months. (The Largest fundings are highlighted in the table below.)
Full interactive list here.
Funding for the past year is down from $280 million invested during the prior 12 months. (Though to be fair,the lion's share of that, $240 million, went to China-based dating app Baihe, a decade-old category leader.)
While recent numbers look low, it should be noted that VCs and dating startups never had a particularly successful relationship history. Often they're strategically mismatched. VCs look for a loyal, active, long-term user base, and dating apps tend to attract periodic, short-term users. Monetization is also a challenge, as paid apps have to compete with free ones. There are also few deep-pocketed acquirers with interest in the space.
Moreover, venture capitalists haven't made a lot of money from dating. The most successful US-launched dating app in recent years, Tinder, was incubated by Internet publishing giant IAC in 2012 and didn't rely on VC funding. The sole large U.S. public company in the space, Match Group, is also an IAC spin-out.
Venture investors had hoped mobile dating app Zoosk would deliver a big IPO a couple years ago, but it fizzled. The San Francisco company, which had raised more than $60 million in venture funding, pulled its planned public offering more than a year ago, citing unfavorable market conditions. It hasn't closed a round since.
For the companies that did get funded in the past couple of years, there are some common attributes that shed light on what investors want in a dating startup.
Most of all, it helps to be based in China. Over the past two years, the largest funding rounds by far for dating startups have gone to Chinese companies. The largest funding for the past year, $32 million, went to Tantan, a mobile dating app modeled on Tinder. Blued, an app for gay users modeled on Grindr, raised a Series C round of undisclosed size at a reported $300 million valuation.
Investors also seemed drawn to startups offering tools to narrow down and simplify dating options. In this camp is CoffeeMeetsBagel, which matches women with a limited number of men who have expressed interest in them. It has raised $11 million to date. Three Day Rule, which provides subscribers with a personal matchmaker, was one of few U.S. dating companies to score Series A funding last year, bringing in $1.2 million. Zurich-based Once, which pairs subscribers with one handpicked match per day, raised $5.6 million.
Perhaps if Tinder's parent company Match can prove that dating apps can drive long-term growth in revenue per user, domestic investors will take more interest in the sector. For now, this Valentine's day looks like a canceled date between the local venture community and the entrepreneurs who think that everyone has a shot at love.

The Internet Archive is now home to the world's largest collection of digitized vinyl recordings, with the Great 78 Project working tirelessly to preserve, research and discover 78rpm records.
As reported by The Verge, 50,000 recordings can now be listened to online, from anywhere in the world, anytime you like - for free.
The project researchers say there were approximately 3 three million "sides" made on 78rpm discs from about 1898 to the 1950s. The ones that were a "hit" - they made it to LP or CD as well. This project aims to bring the lesser-known recordings to the modern era, in a format that allows researchers to manipulate and study the recordings without causing any damage to the originals.
You see, most 78s weren't "vinyl" at all - but made from shellac (a type of beetle resin) and are incredibly brittle - even picking them up can make them break apart in your hands, the recordings lost forever.
Australian Musicians: How They Feel About Vinyl Vinyl sales are up. Way up. A growth 80 per cent in the last year was recorded for Australia alone. For Australian artists, this means sales - of course. But what do Paul Dempsey, Meg Mac and Birds of Tokyo's Adam Weston really think of the format? And what is their personal history with it? Read more
This project doesn't want to "improve" on the recordings with remastering, but preserve them exactly as they sound.
With the Great 78 Projects collaboration, the Internet Archive now has over 200,000 donated physical recordings. You can browse the collection by year, creator, genre and language.

Turtle Team members rise at dawn seven days a week to look for the telltale two-foot wide tracks of nesting loggerheads. But in addition to these, we often come across some very strange and wondrous discoveries. Some of these have been:
• Portuguese Men of War and other jellyfish. The fourth week of May, Dan photographed a beautiful but deadly Portuguese Man of War in the edge of the surf as the sun rose at the 18th fairway of the Links Course in Wild Dunes. It made a beautiful photograph.
• Horseshoe Crabs spawning. From April until July large horseshoe crabs crawl above the high tide line at new and full moons to spawn. Sometimes they get stranded far from the water and are put back in by caring team members.
• Manatees. In 2016, Kristen Ayers spotted “Goose” an adult male manatee in Dewees Inlet. He was pulling a white buoy that was tracking his route so scientists could follow his travels around our area.
• Stranded turtles and marine mammals. Unfortunately we also find dead or injured sea turtles, which are usually loggerheads, green turtles, Kemps Ridleys or more rarely, leatherbacks. We do strand reports on the dead ones and have them buried. We transport the live ones to the SC Aquarium. With dolphins or an occasional small whale, we call NOAA and scientists from the Hollings Marine Lab will come and take them to James Island for necropsies.
• Bird Eggs. With the recent king tides, we've been getting calls of turtle eggs washing up on the beach. These were brown speckled shorebird eggs, often from laughing gull or pelican nests that have washed away when rookeries such as nearby Crab Bank have been flooded. They are not viable and cannot be saved. Sea turtle eggs are pure white and round, looking like ping pong balls. They are buried about 1-2 feet under the sand, so it would take quite a storm tide to unearth them.
• Money and Cell Phones. Many Turtle Team members have found cash, wallets and cell phones. If their owners can be identified, these are turned in to the police department who track down the owners. However, a $20 bill blowing down the beach is certainly fair game. What a reward for getting up at dawn.
• Clothing. It appears that many romantic trysts occur on our beaches after dark. One turtle nest near 51st Avenue a few years ago actually contained a buried pair of pink lace panties, oh my! And on May 27 this year there was a nice pair of high heels near 3rd Avenue that fit Christel Cothran perfectly. There was also a pair of shorts, but no one wanted to try them on…
And of course we are always indebted to team members who regularly carry large bags and pick up many pounds of litter. It does seem that people would know not to do this. You just never know what is going to be left on the beach at dawn.

Worried by poor performance of Exercise Ayem A' Kpatuma or Cat Race , a military spike exercise to check incursions of herdsmen in Benue State, Governor Samuel Ortom has appealed to the Federal Government to upgrade the exercise to a full military operation to effectively check the ongoing killings in the state's rural communities.
Governor Ortom made the appeal, yesterday, during on the spot assessment of four Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs, camps at Abagena in Makurdi, Daudu and Gbajimba in Guma local government area of the state. Speaking separately at the four camps visited, the governor said:
"With the magnitude of crisis we have at hand, given the ongoing killings, despite the ongoing Exercise Ayem A' Kpatuma, we appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Government to convert the exercise to a full military operation to chase out the killer herdsmen from our communities.
"I know that the rules of engagement in an exercise and operation are completely different, that is why we are demanding a full military operation in Benue State to check these killings and to ensure that the displaced persons, who are over 170,000, returned to their homes.
"There is so much fear in the people as more than 50 communities in Guma, Logo, Makurdi, Agatu and Gwer West local government areas have been affected by the crisis and we are still counting because IDPs are still pouring into the camps because night attacks are still going on in these communities.
"I was told that about 150 herdsmen have been arrested in Benue by security personnel, some for violating the Open Grazing Prohibition Law and some of them were arrested for the killings in our communities.
In his remarks, Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, Mr. Emmanuel Shior, lamented that the government and the agency were overwhelmed by the number of the IDPs, which he put at over 170,000.
On new births in the eight camps, Shior said: “120 births were recorded in the eight camps since January so far, but it has not been easy for government to cope with the humanitarian crisis we have at hand at the moment.”
It was gathered from health officials in the camps visited that 15 deaths had been recorded in the four camps. The figures indicated that Abagena camp recorded nine deaths, LGEA Primary School Daudu camp recorded one death, same as the UNHCR Shelter Camp Daudu, while four deaths were recorded at the Gbajimba camp.
Responding, a spokesman of the IDPs at the UNHCR Shelter camp, Jacob Iorshelegh, appealed to the Federal Government to encourage security personnel to push out herdsmen from their communities to enable them return to their homes.

The Code of Conduct Tribunal sitting in Abuja on Wednesday, ruled that Senate president, Dr. Bukola Saraki has no case to answer in the 18 charges of non-declaration of assets brought against him by the Federal Government.
Recall that the Federal Government had on September 16, 2015 filed a 13-count charge against Saraki for alleged false and anticipatory declaration of assets.
The charges were increased to 15 on April 18, 2016 and another charge was added on April 27, 2016 to make it 16.
The government later increased the charges to 17 on January 11, 2017 and finally to 18 on February 23, 2017.
The two-man panel led by its Chairman, Danladi Umar of the CCT had reserved its ruling after hearing Saraki's no-case submission and the Federal Government's objection to it on June 8.
The Senate President, through his no-case submission filed before the CCT on May 26, 2017, contended that none of the exhibits tendered and no evidence given by the four prosecution witnesses linked him to the alleged offences to warrant him to defend the charges.
GENEVA (Reuters) - Trade barriers being erected by major economies could jeopardize the global economic recovery and their effects are already starting to show, the World Trade Organization said on Wednesday in a report on trade restrictions among G20 nations.

“This continued escalation poses a serious threat to growth and recovery in all countries, and we are beginning to see this reflected in some forward-looking indicators,” WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo said in a statement.
He did not elaborate, but in May the WTO's quarterly trade outlook indicator suggested trade would grow slower in the second quarter than in the first.
One component of its composite forward-looking indicator is international air freight data from the International Transport Association, which issued its figures for May on Wednesday.
IATA said air cargo demand was expected to grow by “a modest 4.0 percent” in 2018, less than the 4.5 percent foreseen in December.
“Headwinds are strengthening with growing friction among governments on trade. We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,” IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said in a statement.
The WTO analysis found that G20 countries introduced 39 new trade restrictions between mid-October last year and mid-May this year, double the rate seen in the previous period, affecting trade in iron and steel, plastics and vehicles.
“The marked increase in new trade restrictive measures among G20 economies should be of real concern to the international community,” Azevedo said, adding that more restrictions had been put in place in the weeks after the period under review ended.
The WTO report did not name any particular country, but since the start of the year U.S. President Donald Trump has launched a series of tariffs to punish what he sees as unfair trade, by allies and economic rivals alike.
“At a juncture where the global economy is finally beginning to generate sustained economic momentum following the global financial crisis, the uncertainty created by a proliferation of trade restrictive actions could place economic recovery in jeopardy,” the WTO report said.
It added that the world trading system was built to resolve such problems but the escalating tensions were a threat to the system itself, and G20 economies needed to use all means at their disposal to de-escalate the situation and promote further trade recovery.

BRAGA-AC Milan striker Andre Silva hit a landmark 1000th goal for the hosts but there was little to celebrate as Cristiano Ronaldo-less Portugal were held 2-2 by Tunisia in a pre-World Cup friendly on Monday.
Still smarting from a 3-0 defeat to the Netherlands in Geneva last March, Portugal fans were hoping for a morale-boosting win less than two weeks before they head to Russia. But the defending European champions, who face Spain, Morocco and Iran in Group B, largely flattered to deceive.
Ronaldo and his goalscoring exploits would have been welcome in Braga, but the Portugal striker was given time off following Real Madrid's 3-1 victory over Liverpool in the Champions League final on Saturday.
Portugal coach Fernando Santos gave Silva the nod and, despite a lack of playing time at Milan, the 22-year-old did well to head home the opener from Ricardo Quaresma's pinpoint cross on 22 minutes. It was the 1000th goal scored in Portugal colours.
Portugal doubled their lead on 34 minutes when Joao Mario, who has also endured a tough season in Italy with Inter Milan and a loan move to West Ham, pounced on a poor clearance from a corner to fire a rocket into the top corner from the edge of the area.
Strong and physical throughout, Tunisia were sorely lacking technique and attacking prowess.
But when the disappointing Raphael Guerreiro fluffed his lines, Esperance striker Anice Badri reduced arrears just before the interval.
Portugal continued to dominate but after Bernardo Silva fired wide the hosts paid the price for loose defending when Fakhredine Ben Youssef hit a 64th minute equaliser. Portugal is likely to still be without Ronaldo when they face Belgium in Brussels on June 2 and Algeria in Lisbon on June 7.
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banking regulator has imposed fines of 52.5 million yuan ($8.36-million) on 19 banks in the northwestern province of Shaanxi and the central province of Henan over a 19-billion-yuan ($3-billion) pledged loan fraud, it said on Friday.
It is the third major penalty handed down since the start of the year as the regulator steps up a crackdown on illegal practices to fend off financial risk.
Criminals illegally pledged gold of low purity to obtain loans from banks, including branches of large state lenders Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (601398.SS)(1398.HK) and Postal Savings Bank of China Co (1658.HK), the regulator said.
The findings highlight the lack of internal controls and poor management of loans and collateral at the banks involved, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) said in an online statement.
“The banks were overly obsessed with pursuing the scale and speed of business development, without knowing their customers,” it added.
Poor risk assessment and weak legal infrastructure leave Chinese banks suffering from rampant “ghost collateral” - security that appears to be on the books, but which, upon closer inspection, is not there or is worth less than it seems.
Last week, the regulator fined 12 lenders after uncovering illegal trading of 7.9 billion yuan of bank bills.
Three PSBC branches involved in the pledged loan fraud were fined 10 million yuan, while four ICBC branches were fined 6.5 million yuan in total, the regulator said.
It also punished 104 bank employees involved in the case, the regulator added.
SARGODHA - Five policemen were booked on Friday over failure to prevent an in-custody murder accused from jumping into canal. The accused was later fished out dead.
The policemen were identified as Assistant Sub Inspector (ASI) Muhammad Ashraf, Constable Saqlain and two others. They were booked with the Phularwan Police.
The DPO ordered a thorough inquiry into the matter and sought early report.
Remember that deceased Lutfur Rehman was involved in murder of Waqas (14) for ransom. He was being brought by police party led by ASI Muhammad Ashraf to Anti-Terrorism Court when the handcuffed accused jumped into canal to escape but drowned.

Re: Your smartphone is another addiction to be avoided, Opinion, Aug. 14
Your smartphone is another addiction to be avoided, Opinion, Aug. 14
Great column by Ari Goldkind about smartphones being an addiction and a major cause of distracted driving. Mr. Goldkind argues that even using hands-free or Bluetooth causes distracted driving. After an incident I had last week, I couldn't agree more.
I was attempting to contact my daughter, using my phone and the Bluetooth feature, while I was driving. Just as she answered the phone, I was approaching a red light. I stopped and, without thinking (distracted by our conversation), I looked both ways, saw it was clear and drove through the red light, as if it was a four-way stop.
This was a perfect example of distracted driving, even though talking on the phone hands-free is legal.

(Jeff Wheeler/Star Tribune via AP, File)/Star Tribune via AP)
MINNEAPOLIS (AP)  A doctor who saw Prince in the days before he died had prescribed oxycodone under the name of Princes friend to protect the musicians privacy, according to an affidavit unsealed Monday.
The document is one of several affidavits and search warrants unsealed in Carver County District Court as the yearlong investigation into Princes death continues.
The documents dont say where Prince got the fentanyl that killed him, which was obtained illegally and not by prescription. But they do shed some light on Princes struggle with addiction in the days before he died. Oxycodone was not listed as a cause of Princes death.
Prince was 57 when he was found alone and unresponsive in an elevator at his Paisley Park home on April 21. Autopsy results showed he died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl, a synthetic drug 50 times more powerful than heroin.

According to the search warrants, authorities searched Paisley Park, cellphone records of Princes associates, and Princes email accounts to try to determine how he got the fentanyl.
A search of Princes home yielded numerous pills in various containers. Some were in prescription bottles that were under the name Kirk Johnson, Princes longtime friend and associate. Some pills in other bottles were marked as if they were a mix of acetaminophen and hydrocodone  but at least one of those tested positive for fentanyl, meaning it was counterfeit.
The documents suggest Prince was struggling with an addiction to prescription opioids. Just six days before he died, Prince fell ill on a plane and made an emergency stop in Illinois as he was returning home from a concert in Atlanta. First responders revived him with two doses of a drug that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose.
One affidavit says Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg, who saw Prince April 7, 2016, and again on April 20, admitted to authorities that he prescribed oxycodone for Prince the same day as the emergency plane landing but put the prescription in Kirk Johnsons name for Princes privacy.
Authorities also searched Johnsons cellphone records, to see who he was communicating with in the month before Prince died.
Messages left with attorneys for Schulenberg and Johnson werent immediately returned Monday. Schulenberg has an active medical license and is currently practicing medicine in Minnesota. His attorney, Amy Conners, told the AP last week that there are no restrictions on his license.
Investigators havent interviewed either Johnson or Schulenberg since the hours after Prince died, an official with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.
While authorities have the power to ask a grand jury to investigate and issue subpoenas for testimony, that step hasnt been taken, the official said.
Prince did not have a cellphone, and authorities searched multiple email accounts that belonged to him, as they tried to determine who he was communicating with and where he got the drugs that killed him, according to the search warrants. The search warrants dont reveal the outcome of the email searches.
The documents say some of the drugs in Princes bedroom were in a suitcase with the name Peter Bravestrong on it. Police believe Bravestrong was an alias that Prince used when he traveled. The suitcase also contained lyrics for the song U Got the Look that appeared to be in Princes handwriting.
Investigators have said little about the case over the last year, other than it is active. The official who spoke to the AP said the case has taken investigators to Illinois and California, as authorities have interviewed friends, family and any potential witnesses, including the flight crew and hospital staff that were present when Prince overdosed on the plane.

A community is in mourning after a driver plowed into a crowd of pedestrians in north Toronto on Monday, leaving 10 people dead and 15 others injured.
Here is what we know and don't know about the attack.
What happened?
Just before 1:30 p.m. Monday, a van mounted the sidewalk on Yonge Street, just south of Finch Avenue. Police have identified the driver as 25-year-old Alek Minassian from Richmond Hill, Ont.
The van, which appeared to belong to the rental company Ryder, continued southbound until just south of Sheppard Avenue. Witnesses describe seeing the driver “deliberately” hit multiple pedestrians.

The driver was arrested after a brief sidewalk standoff with a Toronto police officer not far from the carnage.
Video footage showed the police officer staring down the suspect at gunpoint in the middle of a street, while the man pointed an object at the officer and shouted: “Kill me.” The video showed the suspect repeatedly pulling an object from his side and aiming at police.

As the suspect shouted “Kill me,” the officer replied, “No, get down.” When the suspect said, “I have a gun in my pocket,” the officer responded: “I don't care. Get down.”
How many people have died?
Ten people have died so far and 15 others were injured.
One of the victims has been identified as Anne Marie D'Amico, an employee at Invesco, a U.S.-based investment management company. One of the company's Canadian offices is located at 5140 Yonge St., between Sheppard and Finch avenues.

Earlier Monday, Sunnybrook hospital in Toronto said it had received 10 patients from the scene: two were without vital signs and were pronounced dead upon arriving at the hospital; five patients were in critical condition; two were in serious condition, and one was in fair condition.
North York General Hospital said it received four patients: one in critical and three in stable condition.

Who is the suspect?
Not much is known about the suspect at the moment. An online social media profile described Minassian as a student at Seneca College in Toronto.
Minassian appeared in court Tuesday morning and has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder.

Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders told reporters during a briefing Monday evening that the suspect wasn't known to authorities.
“It's quite apparent that the suspect was trying to be executed. He was really looking for ‘suicide-by-cop,'” Gary Clement, a retired Royal Canadian Mounted Police superintendent with 34 years of policing experience, told Reuters.
Is there a motive?
Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders said it was too early to suggest a motive for the deadly incident but did say the incident definitely looked deliberate.”
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with the media regarding the attack and national security.

“Obviously, all Canadians continue and will continue to have questions about why this happened, what could possibly be the motives behind it,” Trudeau said.
“As was indicated last night by our public security minister, at this time we have no reason to suspect that there is any national security element to this attack but obviously the investigation continues.”

Police investigating

Afghanistan
More than 100 people were killed and over 200 wounded in a suicide bombing in Kabul on Saturday, Jan. 27. The attackers drove an ambulance into a crowded street in a district of government buildings and embassies where the bomb detonated at a security checkpoint. The Sunni Islamic fundamentalist political movement the Taliban are said to be behind the attack. Afghanistan's government declared the following day, Sunday, was to be a day of mourning set aside for funerals and an opportunity for families to find survivors.
Kenya
Four people have been killed and an estimated 6,000 left homeless when a fire hit the Lang'ata neighborhood in Nairobi on Sunday, Jan. 28. The fire trucks that came to the rescue ran out of water and were unable to stop the fire from spreading. It took eight hours to contain the fire and authorities were not able to get extra equipment from nearby sources. Second Deputy Governor of Nairobi Polycarp Igathe has ordered a full investigation of the fire.

Gunmen stormed a nightclub and killed 14 people and wounded several others in the early hours of Saturday, Jan. 27 just outside of Fortaleza in the state of Ceará. The attackers are said to be part of a criminal gang involved in drug trafficking. This is Ceará's deadliest mass shooting on record, a title previously held by a 2015 nightclub shooting that killed 11 people.

Jordanian TV presenter and professional martial arts athelete Shadia Bseiso is the first Arab woman to sign with American entertainment company World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). She has just started an intense training program with the company in Orlando, Florida with the help of wrestling and cardio trainers as well as camera and acting instructors. Bseiso has previously worked as a TV host, voice-over artist, events presenter, professional jiu-jitsu athlete and private owner of a media company based in Dubai. It could take up to two years of training before Bseiso will be able to enter the ring onscreen.
Korea
North Korea abruptly cancelled a cultural event scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 4 with South Korea. It was to be part of a series of events including art performances and martial arts demonstrations seen as a thawing of ties leading up to South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang from February 9 to 25. North Korea withdrew from the events, blaming “biased” and “insulting” media coverage in the South. The two nations are to march under a unified flag at the games and have a combined women's ice hockey team. There are ten other Northern athletes expected, as well as hundreds of delegates, cheerleaders and performers.
LONDON (Reuters) - If money decided the title, City would already be crowned champions after splashing more than 200 million pounds ($260.22 million) on reinforcements this summer.
Even though their opponents, Brighton & Hove Albion, had broken their own transfer record three times this window, the Seagulls' outlay was roughly one-tenth that of City -- forcing them to mind the gap.
What Pep Guardiola has really bought himself is options, with three debutants in the starting XI and a further 206 million pounds' worth of talent on the bench.
After a frustrating first half, which highlighted City's failures up front from last season, change was always going to come, and the breakthrough arrived within minutes of the introduction of Leroy Sané in the 68th minute.
The scorer was all too familiar, with Sergio Aguero capitalising on a delightful pass from David Silva.
Before the game Guardiola spoke cryptically about not always playing Aguero and Jesus up front but on Saturday he gave Brighton the full double blast, which paid off -- eventually.
When and how to employ the pair may define Guardiola's season.
Afterwards the manager was predictably delighted with all the riches at his disposal and promised that City will "improve the way we attack" this season.
His fullbacks will be crucial to that game plan, with former Tottenham defender Kyle Walker providing the pace out wide so obviously missing last season.
Danilo, a right-footed left back, was less impressive but he is likely to play second fiddle to Benjamin Mendy once the Frenchman recovers from the thigh strain that kept him out on Saturday.
"I was very happy with the new players. I want to say thank you to the club," Guardiola said. "We have huge players with lots of talent. Big congratulations to all the people in Manchester City -- we are a strong club."
Arguably, no manager is under greater pressure this season than the Spaniard, who after one trophyless campaign knows he must deliver something special.
TWITTER SPAT
Dressed rather like an American college student in beige trousers, a black top and white pumps, he cut a relaxed figure on the touchline, knowing, perhaps, that there would be tougher tests ahead.
His biggest problem may be keeping everyone happy as he tweaks his teamsheet. With so much talent at his disposal, City's players know they have limited time to impress.
"I want to continue with what we did in the last three games of pre-season," said Guardiola. "We were stable but we have to try to improve. The most important thing was to win the first game."
The only sour note for City was a tweet from Mendy, saying: "Bullet header" in reference to Lewis Dunk's own goal. TV pundits criticised it as "disrespectful".
Perhaps Guardiola will have to find the Frenchman something more constructive to do next week.

There's no place like home for the Dallas Stars, who are 10-4-0 at the American Airlines Center this season. They struggled mightily away from Dallas last season, posting a disappointing 12-24-5 road record, and are 6-9-1 as visitors so far in 2017-18.
The Stars left town after practice Sunday, heading east on a tough four-game tour of the Metropolitan Division. They hope to end their three-game losing skid Monday night in New York, where they'll face the Rangers at Madison Square Garden. The visiting Stars are 5-3-0 in their last eight games at MSG, and there's a simple explanation for their success at “The World's Most Famous Arena”: they love playing there.
Spezza Thrives on MSG “Buzz”
“MSG is pretty electric and feels special to be playing there,” said Stars center Jason Spezza. “It's kind of the same with Montreal, there's always a little bit of a buzz.”
The veteran forward, who named Madison Square Garden and Montreal's Bell Centre as his favorite road arenas, was asked whether visiting players feed off the atmosphere in those venues.
“Yeah, I think you get a little more jacked up,” said Spezza. “You get heckled a little bit, there's a buzz around the rink…I like it when the fans are a little bit on top of you and those two rinks, the fans are on top of you a little bit more, so it makes it a little more hostile environment, makes it fun to play.
Clearly, Spezza enjoys playing the Garden: He's put up 5-5-10 in his last six games there and leads all Stars in career goals, assists and points at MSG, with 13-20-33 in 38 contests.
Seguin Likes It Loud
Stars center Tyler Seguin echoed his teammate's comments.
“I like MSG, I like Chicago, I like Montreal…that's probably my top three,” said Seguin. “It's just the atmosphere. I like loud places. MSG is more about the history, Chicago and Montreal the atmosphere. The fans are great and it's always very loud. Whether you're at home or the visiting team, you still get excited with how loud it is.”
Surprisingly, the superstar has just one career goal in 19 games against the Rangers, and that came when he was with the Boston Bruins. The only other team Seguin's scored one goal against? The Vegas Golden Knights (he's never scored on the Anaheim Ducks, but we'll get into that another time).
The Stars' need to end their losing streak adds pressure to this road trip. With that in mind, Seguin was asked why it's harder for teams in general (not just the Stars) to win on the road. He pondered the question before answering.
“It's generally comfortable at home,” said Seguin. “You just have so much knowledge of things that have gone right and wrong at home that you just kind of trigger it and it doesn't matter who you're playing, and on the road…The fans, the momentum, it's harder to grab because there's 20,000 people on one team's side, and it always makes it trickier to win on the road. You have to really simplify on the road to have success.”
Bishop Loves Broadway
Count The World's Tallest Goalie as another fan of The World's Most Famous Arena.
“Yeah, Madison Square Garden. Probably that and Chicago are my two favorite places on the road,” said Stars netminder Ben Bishop. “New York, it's kind of like, ‘Broadway!' You kind of feel like you're on a stage. It's a neat arena, because it's got a lot of history to it and good atmosphere. They've played a lot of pretty significant games in that arena, so you have a lot of competitive juices [flowing] when you think about it.”
Kari Lehtonen will start for the Stars against the Rangers, so Bishop will be a well-paid and well-padded spectator at MSG Monday night.
Big Ben was also asked about home versus road games. Maybe it's because Bishop's a goalie, and goalies see the game differently, but he doesn't see a difference between home and road contests.
“I don't think it really is [different]. I mean, maybe just the home confines, your own crowd, but…it's the same game,” said Bishop. “There's really nothing different, so it shouldn't be any easier or harder. It's the same game; you get the last change [as the home team], but that's about it. I don't think it's necessarily harder. I don't think it's mental, it's just a matter of going out there and doing it.”
Hitchcock's Diplomatic Disclosure
After talking to the players, I was curious as to whether Stars head coach Ken Hitchcock had a favorite road arena. Hitch contemplated the question for a few moments before answering.
“I'm more partial to the older ones because they had character and they weren't cookie-cutter,” said the coach. “But some of the new ones that have a ‘wow factor,' like the arena in Edmonton's got a ‘wow factor' that's incredible. For me, it's more the arenas that have kept their stature and their style and their grace, even though they're older arenas.”
Hitchcock continued, working in a plug for the Stars' home arena while sprinkling compliments around the league as smoothly as any politician.
“To me, there's no better looking arena than American Airlines [Center], because they've kept that arena in immaculate shape for us, which is really nice to see,” said Hitch. “It's 15 years old and it looks brand new. It's the same as the arena in Philadelphia. Those are the ones that really, really impress me, the way that they look despite being 20 years old. But looking at the new ones that are coming out now, like the one in Edmonton has a lot of conveniences that are really fan-friendly, like Detroit, everybody talks about how great Detroit is for the fans. Those are the ones.”
One thing is clear: If the whole hockey thing doesn't work out, Ken Hitchcock has a bright future in politics.

Californians who were ordered to evacuate due to a threat from the tallest dam in the United States can now return home after state crews working around the clock reinforced a drainage channel that was weakened by heavy rain.
Officials had ordered 188,000 people living down river from the Oroville Dam to evacuate on Sunday and reduced that to an evacuation warning on Tuesday, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said.
That means people can move back to their homes and businesses can reopen, but they should be prepared to evacuate again if necessary, Honea told a news conference.
Both the primary and backup drainage channels of the dam, known as spillways, were damaged by a buildup of water that resulted from an extraordinarily wet winter in Northern California that followed years of severe drought.
READ MORE: What happened to California's Oroville Dam spillway and why have so many been evacuated?
The greater danger was posed by the emergency spillway, which was subject to urgent repairs in recent days. Though damaged, the primary spillway was still useable, officials said.
More rain was forecast for as early as Wednesday and through Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, but the state Department of Water Resources said the upcoming storms were unlikely to threaten the emergency spillway.
WATCH: Oroville, Calif. evacuation zone order reduced to a warning zone
Evacuees received more good news from President Donald Trump, who declared an emergency in the state, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate disaster relief efforts.
The lifting of the mandatory evacuation improved the mood among evacuees at Silver Dollar Fairgrounds in Chico, where families packed cars and sifted through piles of donated clothing.

Philip Haar, 37, of Oroville, prepared to take his five dogs back home. He also would be able to feed the rabbit he left behind.
“I'm confident with the warning, at least we'll know the next time something happens to be prepared more than this time,” Haar said.
But Richard and Anna Lawson of Oroville said they were not rushing home. Officials last week expressed calm, then abruptly ordered the evacuation on Sunday.
“They kept contradicting themselves. Every time they said something they turned around and said something different,” said Richard, 25.
“We're waiting until tomorrow to hear something. We're going to wait until the storm comes through,” said Anna, 21.
The sheriff credited swift action by the Department of Water Resources to shore up the emergency spillway and use the main spillway to relieve pressure on the dam, averting the immediate danger of a dam failure, Honea said.
A failure could have unleashed a wall of water three stories tall on towns below.
WATCH: Emergency workers using giant rocks to try to address damage to Oroville Dam spillway
State officials used 40 trucks carrying 30 tons of rock per hour to reinforce the eroded area around the emergency spillway while two helicopters dropped rock and other materials into the breach.
READ MORE: Oroville dam managers dismissed flood warning over a decade ago
“We're aggressively attacking the erosion concerns that have been identified,” said William Croyle, acting director of the Department of Water Resources.
Water authorities had been relieving pressure on the dam through the concrete-lined primary spillway last week, but lake levels rose as storm water surged in and engineers moderated its use. Then the rising water topped over the earthen backup spillway, which has a concrete top, for the first time in the dam's 50-year history over the weekend.
When the emergency spillway showed signs of erosion, engineers feared a 30-foot-high section could fail, leading to the evacuation order on Sunday. Both spillways are next to the dam, which itself is sound, engineers say.

Back in April, At The Drive-In released a music video for single “Hostage Stamps”. Directed by Rob Shaw, the stop-motion creation featured militaristic figures and a rebellious prisoner who devises an escape plan. Today, the hard rock outfit has let loose the official clip for “Call Broken Arrow”, and its meant to serve as a prequel to what went down in “Hostage Stamps”.
(Read: At The Drive-In's Top 10 Songs)
Shaw, again sitting in the director's chair, offered a statement on the intense, brooding visual:
“In ‘Hostage Stamps', we have a prisoner being tortured and monitored by some sort of authoritarian organization. The guys wanted to show why he was imprisoned, as well as cast doubt over his innocence. It's funny how in stories, especially film stories, you tend to sympathize with whoever you spend time with. When you watch someone being mistreated, the assumption is that person is the victim. ‘Call Broken Arrow' is in part about illustrating the prisoner's culpability, but even that is in doubt as we see the Watcher character who follows him around slipping something in his drink at the end.”
Watch it in full up above. Both videos are in support of ATDI's first album in nearly two decades, in • ter a • li • a.
LOS ANGELES:- Tom Hardy's standalone ‘Venom' movie will not be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, despite the character being one of Spider-Man's biggest foes. The 39-year-old actor will be playing one of the web-slinging superhero's greatest villains in the upcoming Sony film, ‘Venom', but Marvel Studios insist they won't be welcoming the character into their wider cinematic universe any time soon. Speaking in a live Q&A with fans, Marvel Studios producer Kevin Feige dismissed the idea he could introduce the character into the blockbuster movie series. He told Allocine: ‘'No plans to include him in the MCU right now.
[The ‘Venom' movie] is Sony's project.'' Meanwhile, it's a busy time for Tom at the moment following reports he could be taking on a lead role in Guy Ritchie's highly anticipated live-action ‘Aladdin' reboot. The 39-year-old actor could be in with a shot of playing Jafar, after the director reached out to him about taking on the villainous part. A source said recently: ‘'Guy is a huge fan of Tom's work and securing him would be a major coup. There have been conversations and, although nothing is set in stone and things are subject to change, he's certainly one of Guy's favoured choices.''

In addition to the two albums Kanye is working on, he's also producing an album by Nas. It's reportedly coming out on June 15th, and it'll be his first album in six years.
Kanye is also working on Pusha T's new album and Teyana Taylor's new album. And he's still stirring up controversy.
He recently Tweeted that he, “loves the way Candace Owens thinks.” But some fans are upset, because she's called President Trump a “savior” . . . and has been a critic of Black Lives Matter.
Towards the end of the year, 2016, I asked the secretary of Health, Najam Ahmed Shah why he did not recruit at least four ‘Edhis' if he really wished to revamp the health sector in Punjab. “Give me four Edhis”, he spontaneously reacted. “Admittedly, I cannot find someone like Edhi but, yes, I can definitely give you four like him”, I safely offered.
The Chief Minister of Punjab raised eyebrows in one of his articles on the subject published in another esteemed newspaper, inviting the readers to imagine how ‘scores of patients were suffering for months due to the absence of a commonly used medicine called Flagyl, with demand falling on deaf ears and money lying in the bank, unutilised?'
While both the chief minister and the secretary seemed to be on the same page and pitch by chanting catchy slogans, ‘patient care' and ‘patient first' respectively, it raises certain queries such as whether both the political and administrative heads are truly apologetic of situation? The secretary, for instance, felt handicapped by chains of possible strikes by all the senior doctors if he opted to remove a delinquent senior professor by way of disciplinary proceedings against him and hence giving him rather a safe exit by offering the option of retirement despite having incriminating evidence against him.
Certain other queries are so floating on the surface which need to be addressed if we really intend to redress our apology for the health situation. These can precisely be enumerated as to first, whether there are any policy irritants afflicting the targeted growth in the health sector? Second, are we lacking those real measures which may lead to a better infrastructure, technology and capacity building? Third, whether we are really running short of funds and unable to tap the contributions of foreign funded and monitored projects vis-à-vis other South Asian countries? Fourth, whether the mal-administration and the lethargic attitude of the medical, paramedical and bureaucratic human resource is the sole problem behind this health syndrome? Fifth, can there be any other defence to this apology about why the government cannot purchase health for the people and convert the wealth mines to those of health mines? Sixth, whether the successful health models of Singapore, Australia and other countries like Turkey could suit our indigenous culture? And last, whether the health sector is sincerely our first priority as claimed by the policymakers under jargons of ‘patient care' or ‘patient first?'
While representing the government of Pakistan at an important international exhibition and conference at Dubai called Arab Health and in a subsequent international health exhibition-cum-conference, ‘Medika' coordinated by myself at Lahore, I closely observed the best healthcare models of Australia and Singapore which, though cannot be completely replicated in our country but can fairly be modelled to our health systems. Contrary to ours, the first and foremost characteristic of their health systems is that they really look at health as a priority and a fundamental human right incumbent towards growth of other sectors of society such as education and economy. In principle, both these states rely upon offering medical facilities to the people matching to their relevant financial capacity. Under state run hospitals, people are offered facilities both at their declared affording and non-affording status. Those who can afford are charged accordingly whereas those non-affording are also charged accordingly but subsidised out of the resources generated from the affording as well as contributed by the state. Whereas under our health systems, a clear divide is seen for the ‘haves' and the ‘have nots' in the form of state-of-the art hospitals for the affording and state run hospitals with meagre infrastructure and poorly managed but still best catering to the non-affording.
The Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute, PKLI, at Bedian Road, Lahore proposed to be run by a Trust under a private-public scheme of management is acclaimed to be such a state-of-the art hospital providing international standard medical facilities to all irrespective of their financial status, rich or the poor. But still we have to see how on its completion in the new year, 2017, it works for the down-trodden, especially the lower ranked government employs which constitutes a major part of target beneficiaries of our society. Its management has to take care that it should not work like some other notable state-of-the-art cancer hospitals in the town where clinical reports cost the poor higher than their monthly income.
Policy irritants are often seen to be in play amongst policymakers and the executants marring all their efforts to minimise demand and supply gap by introducing a matching mechanism of post-graduate-ship both. It has stiffly been contested even on the roads by the Young Doctors' Association (YDA) on certain, prima facie, rational as well as irrational grounds. Simply put, it is true that young doctors' careers should be safeguarded on rational grounds but how can they be justified on their stance of opposing even merit-based central induction?
Similarly, the chief minister maintains that funds are not a problem but mal-administration is. However, the fact remains that we have not been able to utilise even the infrastructure, technology and capacity-building offered and made available to us by local and international donors so much so that certain inventories and funds were withdrawn by international donors whereas these were best utilised by other South Asian countries like India, Bangladesh and even Afghanistan. It, therefore, seems more a question of priority of the policymakers as well as the executants.
Conclusively, ruling out scanty of public funds for health sector is not digestible, therefore, a reasonable portion of taxes and duties deducted from the pharmaceutical industry may be utilised for the public sector on advance instead of a reimbursement basis for sustainable support. The corporate sector may be encouraged or bound to establish distant hospitals under corporate social responsibility laws to provide corporate-like facilities to the labour and agrarian communities near their doorsteps. The construction of new state-run hospitals, which with shortcomings, are time tested to cater to the health needs of the masses at large, are urgently needed.
On the whole, it is still believed that we have abundant health mines in the form of medical and non-medical philanthropists, land lords, businessmen and non-profit organisations like the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplant which can be replicated as role model in other parts of the country. What is primarily required is merely to identify, honour and authorise them to run the systems in various pockets of the country and that may be one short answer to address the issues in the health sector.

As an avid Belle Isle visitor and supporter, I strongly object to the presence of the Grand Prix on Belle Isle. Having automotive race events such as the Grand Prix and the Red Bull events on a nature park such as Belle Isle is incongruous with the original mission of the park. The fact that no environmental impact study has ever been conducted to detail the effects that this event has on the land, wildlife, protected wetlands, etc., is troubling. An organization such as the DNR that has custodial responsibility for this park should be conducting a study such as this as a minimum requirement.
What's most troubling to me is that an organization such as the Grand Prix group can take over prime portions of the park, for three months (setup to teardown) during prime park season. It's just not democratic. Barricades, concrete abutments and chainlink fence deny visitors free and ready access to many of the features of the park and the riverfront, and the bike (and jogging) lanes are obstructed to the point of being unsafe. That an individual or organization (however well-funded) can have the power and authority to tie up a taxpayer-funded public park like this is disgraceful.
I hope that the state will consider not renewing the Grand Prix lease after the final year's race. There is plenty of vacant (and underutilized) parcels of land in the City of Detroit that the Penske people can set up shop and run their race. It should not be staged on Belle Isle.

Police received reports of the first robbery at East 1st Ave. and Commercial Drive just after 1 p.m., followed by a second report at Broadway and Commercial about 30 minutes later, according to a VPD media release.
Investigators got a description of the suspect vehicle, and tracked the suspects to East 1st Ave. and Clark Drive, where a stolen Porsche Cayenne had crashed into several civilian vehicles, police said.

Officers used a pair of police vehicles to block off the stolen Porsche, and arrested its occupants.
Police said the stolen vehicle crashed into four separate civilian vehicles. Four occupants in one of the vehicles were injured as a result.
Photos from the scene show a Porsche SUV with major front-end damage boxed in by several VPD vehicles. At least one other car can be seen with its front wheels on the sidewalk and significant damage to one side.
The area was closed to traffic causing major backups on both 1st Ave. and Clark Drive.
The VPD Major Crime and Collision Investigation Units are working to piece together exactly what happened.
B.C.'s civilian police watchdog, the Independent Investigations Office (IIO), said it was notified of the incident but was not deployed because it did not meet their mandate of probing situations where death or serious injury occur during police action.

Fans of the Toronto Maple Leafs have been pleasantly surprised this year, the biggest reason being the way they've fared against the Washington Capitals in their first two games of the first round of the playoffs.
After ending the 2016-17 regular season with 95 points and 40 games won, the Toronto Maple Leafs had the unfortunate luck of landing the league's top contender as their first round opponent. The Capitals, who ended the season with 118 points and 55 games won, looked far better on paper this season than the young Leafs of Toronto.
Yet the Capitals won game one by a thread, scoring the game-winning goal in the second overtime period. Then they lost game two a couple of days later.
No one saw this coming, although Mike Babcock, the Leafs' head coach, may insist he did. After all, he is the team's chief architect and he's watched them grow from the beginning and he's seeing things most of us don't even know to notice, let alone look for.
So after taking a closer look at the Leafs' regular season games this year, some patterns have emerged that may shed light on their arguably unexpected playoff performance thus far.
Leafs' Defence Is Their Offence
It's always been clear that the Leafs took a top-to-bottom approach in rebuilding their team, as their last three draft classes have boasted high-end forwards. With William Nylander (No. 8, 2014 Draft), Mitch Marner (No. 4, 2015 Draft) and Auston Matthews (No. 1, 2016 Draft) in the mix, they've created both short-term and long-term offensive depth and fans are seeing the dividends pay off tenfold.
This approach is just one of several ways to tackle a rebuild but it also means forfeiting the option of drafting top-tier defensemen. As a result, the Leafs' defense has been weak to put it politely. Ranking third in the league for most shots against per game played (SA/GP), only the Buffalo Sabres and Arizona Coyotes have greater difficulty in limiting their opponent's opportunities to shoot on net.
That right there, says it all.
When it comes to the Washington Capitals though, they have the fewest GA/GP in the league, averaging 2.16 goals scored against per game. That being said, the adage that the best defense is a good offense may be true for the Leafs. In fact, it may be the biggest contributing factor to their impressive handling of the Capitals than most realize.
Style-Of-Play Unique to Divisions
The Leafs' 82 regular season games this year have been distributed among teams within the following divisions as follows:
The more often the Leafs play against teams of a particular division, the better they become at beating them over time and that makes sense. They're developing winning strategies unique to teams by division and they're having success in applying them to their game.
Where things become interesting for the Leafs is with their defensive system and how it impacts their own ability to score goals. They rank fifth in the league in goals for per game played (GF/GP) and the Capitals rank third. And when it comes to the Leafs' defensemen, at least one has scored a goal in a total of 24 different regular season games this year. Of these 24 games, Toronto won 16 of them (or 67 percent) and of the eight games lost, three went to overtime.
Morgan Rielly scores against the Boston Bruins on Mar. 20, 2017:
When a Leafs' defenseman scores, their odds of winning statistically improve. However, of the top 10-ranking teams (for GF/GP), the Leafs and Capitals have the lowest percentage of goals scored by defensemen. Of Washington's 261 goals during the 2016-17 regular season, 11.1 percent were scored by defensemen and of Toronto's 250 goals, 11.2 percent were scored by defensemen. The other eight top teams in this ranking have a range between 11.9 and 16.6 percent of their total goals scored by defensemen, with the median being 14.3 percent. This means that of the league's top-scoring teams, Toronto and Washington both have the smallest scoring contribution from their backend.
Leafs' Defence & Metropolitan Teams
Where the Leafs have managed to find their break is in their defense's consistency against Metropolitan teams specifically. Their defensemen were able to score in 20 percent of games played against Atlantic Division teams, 38 percent of games played against Metropolitan Division teams, 46 percent of games played against Central Division teams and 20 percent of games played against Pacific Division teams.
At first glance, the Leafs' defensemen seem to have an easier time scoring in games played against Central Division teams. However, they only won 31 percent of those games. That's their worst winning percentage for games with scoring from a defenseman by division. In games played against Metropolitan teams though, when a defenseman scored, 77.8 percent of these games were won.

This speaks to the Leafs' style-of-play and how it bodes against styles prominent to each division. When their defensemen are able to score goals but the team is unable to win games, it indicates an imbalance of player responsibility. Perhaps one line is struggling against the size and physicality characterized by teams within a specific division (a characteristic still prevalent in western conference teams). So the defensemen on ice are pulled away from what they're supposed to do, in order to maintain a physically dominant presence. This leads to increased puck possession on the Leafs' backend, which then leads to increased shots on goal from the blue line, which then leads to increased goals scored by defensemen. As a result, the offensive prowess usually elicited by their forwards quickly diminishes while simultaneously diminishing their defense, since their offense is their most prolific form of defense.
When the Leafs' defensemen are able to score goals and win games, it indicates a greater balance of responsibility. When their forwards are maintaining puck possession, their defensemen can focus on playing two-way hockey, which is a rising trend used in this league filled with parity. Although they've only played the Capitals in three regular season games this year, none of which saw their defensemen score, the playoffs have given rise to their blue-liner's scoring abilities nonetheless.
In game one, Jake Gardiner's scored in the first period:
In game two, Morgan Rielly scored in the second period:
The Capitals are excellent at limiting their opposition's opportunities to shoot on goal but they need to limit their physicality against Toronto's forwards, and thereby force the Leafs' blue-liners to defend. Instead of giving them opportunities to battle for pucks, the Capitals need to prevent them because that's how the Leafs are getting their scoring chances now.
Zambia Suspends 48 Opposition Mps For Snubbing President's Speech
Zambia's parliament suspended 48 opposition lawmakers on Tuesday for boycotting a speech by the president, widening a political rift that has alarmed rights groups.
Parliament's speaker barred the United Party for National Development (UPND) politicians from taking their seats for 30 days, a move that banned them from the building and stopped their pay.
Their party, which was defeated in August elections that it said were rigged, called the suspensions unconstitutional.
The lawmakers boycotted President Edgar Lungu's address at the official opening of the assembly in March, saying they did not recognise him as leader.
A month later, the UPND's leader, Hakainde Hichilema, and five others were arrested and charged with treason after a column of opposition vehicles failed to make way for Lungu's motorcade.
Amnesty International has said the treason charges are “trumped up” and called for the politicians' release.
On Tuesday, parliament's speaker Patrick Matibini told the opposition lawmakers: “I challenge you to resign on moral grounds if you do not recognise that there is a legitimately elected government.”
The suspensions affected 48 of the party's 58 MPs. The remaining 10 had officially excused themselves from attending parliament on the day of Lungu's speech and were not included in the suspension.
Hichilema was moved from a prison in Lusaka to a maximum security facility outside the capital on June 9.

The Toronto Public Library (TPL) board has voted in favour of changing its community and event space rental policy after a memorial event in honour of a controversial lawyer earlier this year at a west-end library.
Among the changes outlined in a report approved by board members Monday evening, library staff will be able to deny or cancel bookings “when the library reasonably believes the purpose of the booking is likely to promote, or would have the effect of promoting, discrimination, contempt or hatred of any group.”

“The main objectives of the room booking policy are to provide equitable access to services and to maintain a welcoming and supportive environment free from discrimination and harassment,” the report said.
“The revised language in Toronto Public Library's Community and Event Space Rental policy emphasizes to those wanting to book library spaces, library customers in general, and all stakeholders throughout Toronto, that hate activity is not permitted on library premises.”

The changes come after a memorial event held in July for Barbara Kulaszka, a lawyer whose clients included Marc Lemire, the leader of the now-disbanded white supremacy group Heritage Front, at the Richview branch. Members of city council and residents spoke out against allowing the booking after learning about the memorial.
In the report, the TPL said it consulted with lawyers and was told it could not refuse the booking based on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and other policies. Staff subsequently consulted external lawyers as it reviewed the community and event space rental policy.
The revised policy is scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1.

JAKARTA - A massive fire erupted in a boat carrying hundreds of local tourists to an island north of the Indonesian capital Jakarta Sunday, leaving at least 23 dead and 17 injured, officials said.
Passengers panicked and jumped into the sea as flames and smoke rapidly engulfed the Zahro Express shortly after it left port to head to the popular holiday island of Tidung, the national disaster agency said.
Another 17 people were missing and 194 were rescued following the blaze which started with an explosion in the engine room that the transport ministry said was accidental and could have been caused by an electrical fault. "Fifteen minutes after the boat set sail, people at the back of the boat started making noise," a female passenger Evi, who gave only one name, told local station Metro TV.
"Then I saw smoke, there was more and more, the boat was crowded and people were fighting for life jackets."
Another survivor, Juju Rukminingsih, told how someone took her son's life jacket just as he was about to jump from the boat. "When we wanted to go, I panicked because I saw my son jump off the boat without a (life jacket) because somebody else had taken it," she told a local TV station.
Passing fisherman plucked many of the passengers, all of whom were believed to be Indonesians, to safety and firefighting boats were deployed to put out the blaze. It was just the latest fatal maritime accident in the vast Indonesian archipelago, which relies heavily on boats to ferry people round its 17,000 islands but has a patchy safety record.
After the blaze was extinguished, the boat returned to port and rescuers searched through the fire-blackened vessel, which had been heading to the island 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the capital and part of the Thousand Islands archipelago.
Vessels from several government agencies scoured the sea in the hunt for survivors while the Jakarta governor visited the injured at a local hospital. A manifest had indicated there were around 100 passengers on the vessel but as rescuers plucked passengers from the stricken vessel it became apparent the figure was far higher in a country where overcrowding on boats is common.
"The boat's manifest says there are around 100 people on board, but obviously that's wrong, so we are still searching," national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told AFP.
The agency said that the tourists were likely heading to Tidung to celebrate the New Year. The Thousand Islands, many of which are just a couple of hours by boat from Jakarta, are a popular weekend getaway for residents of the teeming, overcrowded capital of more than 10 million inhabitants.
Fatal boat accidents are common in Indonesia. In September a tourist boat on the resort island of Bali exploded, killing two foreigners and injuring about 20 others. At least 54 people died in November when an overcrowded speedboat carrying three crew and 98 passengers -- mostly Indonesian migrant workers -- struck a reef and sank on its way from Malaysia to Batam.

Opening — and then expanding — a restaurant in Northeast Pennsylvania meant the fulfillment of the American dream for Angie and Steve Kapires.
The Athens, Greece, natives originally opened Greek American Grill on Scranton-Carbondale Highway in ﻿2014, but they quickly outgrew the eight-table venue and moved 5 miles down the road to their current spot by May 2015.
“We started small because we didn't know the area,” Angie Kapires said. “But word of mouth is the best advertising, and people have been kind like that.”
The Kapireses made their way to 540 Scranton-Carbondale Highway, Dickson City, by way of New York, where they each immigrated to at young ages, met and worked. The move to Northeast Pennsylvania — on the recommendation of friends — allowed the couple to buy a home and enjoy what they consider a country lifestyle and better standard of living.
Now married 40 years, the Kapireses have perfected their management system: He acts as the main cook in the kitchen, while she keeps order in the front of the house.
“My husband is old-school. This is his passion. He likes good food,” she said. “We both want to make sure people are satisfied when they come in. In New York, we cater to different people — Italian, Jewish, Greek, everyone.”
This was the thinking behind the blending of American diner classics with traditional ethnic dishes for the breakfasts, lunches and dinners served daily. At the top of the day, Pancake Deluxe (served with two eggs and choice of meat) and Hungry Man platter (complete with three eggs, three meats, homefries and toast) are popular requests. The array of omelettes all are prepared with three eggs each, while the bagels and lox come in portions for parties of one to three.
The restaurant offers daily lunch and dinner specials, though staple menu items such as the Greek Sampler for Two (made with “all the meats we have, plus hummus, stuffed grape leaves and pita bread,” Angie Kapires explained) and the Greek meatballs made with mint stay in high demand.
Gyro platters and sandwiches make up 95 percent of the business, she added, while the pastichio; moussaka; lamb shanks with minestra; roasted chicken with apple stuffing, potato and gravy; Shrimp Santorini and Haddock Spetsiota round out the traditional side of the menu. Grilled octopus is a big seller (“Who knew?” Angie Kapires said with surprise), and years of practice resulted in perfected eggplant and chicken Parmesans.
“His sauce is what does it,” Angie Kapires said of her husband's cooking. “His marinara, people say they can drink it.”
And his Seafood Fra Diavolo makes “people go crazy because my husband makes it spicy,” she added. The Broiled Fisherman Platter, meanwhile, offers a “little bit of everything for every taste bud” thanks to its generous portions of shrimp, scallops, filet, stuffed clams, stuffed tomatoes and stuffed mushrooms.
“The Mediterranean diet is light to eat, and people like that,” Angie Kapires noted, though Greek American Grill certainly doesn't skimp on the homemade desserts, either. The display case boasts colorful platters of rich treats such as baklava cheesecake, old-fashioned rice pudding and bread pudding, Galaktoboureko (phyllo dough and custard with simple syrup) and Ek Mek (shredded phyllo and custard with almonds, simple syrup and homemade whipped cream).
A kids' menu also is available, as is catering for all occasions.
And while the menu reflects the flavors of Greece — from the soft spices to the prevalence of lemon juice, olive oil and oregano — the restaurant's interior also was designed to evoke a Mediterranean vibe.
“I was trying to show people part of Greece,” Angie Kapires said, pointing to framed photos of the island Naxos, where her husband's parents are from; the Acropolis and boats on crystal-clear water. “That's how beautiful Greece is.”
Olive trees and fishers' nets covered with seashells also figure into the decor, and windows painted on the walls are meant to mirror the outdoor eateries popular in Greece. The overall effect feels cozy and welcoming.
“Family atmosphere is a big deal,” Angie Kapires said. “The servers I have are very good to customers, and a good server goes a long way. It feels like home, and they call them by name and remember what they like. It's small enough (that) I can go around. Feedback helps a lot in running a business. We're here every day, morning to night.”
By spring, Greek American Grill will grow again thanks to an expansion of a sunroom it will use for private parties and which will increase the restaurant's seating from 100 to 140.
The hard-earned success is the epitome of the American dream realized, the couple agreed.
“We tried for many years to get people to try ethnic food, and in America, you can do that,” Angie Kapires said. “Scranton took us in and has been very supportive. They help us. I feel the warmth. That's nice as a business owner. It's a nice community. I'm happy I came here.”

GENEVA - Major US trading partners including the European Union, China and Japan voiced deep concern at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Tuesday about possible US measures imposing additional duties on imported autos and parts.
Japan, which along with Russia had initiated the discussion at the WTO Council on Trade in Goods, warned that such measures could trigger a spiral of counter-measures and result in the collapse of the rules-based multilateral trading system, an official who attended the meeting said.
Over 40 WTO members, including the 28 countries of the European Union – warned that the US action could seriously disrupt the world market and threaten the WTO system, given the importance of cars to world trade.
The United States has imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminium imports and is conducting another national security study that could lead to tariffs on imports of cars and car parts. Both sets of tariffs would be based on concerns about US national security.
US President Donald Trump said on June 29 that the probe would be completed in 3-4 weeks.
But the European Union has warned the United States that imposing import tariffs on cars and car parts would harm its own automotive industry and likely lead to counter-measures by its trading partners on $294 billion (£223 billion) of U.S. exports.
A Russian official told the WTO meeting that the issue of US investigations had been raised over the past year in different WTO meetings, only to see things change for the worse.
The United States was losing its reputation as a trusted trade partner, the Russian delegate told the meeting, adding that the United States could soon start an investigation into the case for import tariffs on uranium products.
China, Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Turkey, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Venezuela, Singapore, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Qatar, Thailand and India all echoed the same concerns and said they doubted the U.S. tariffs were in line with WTO rules.
The U.S. diplomat at the meeting said the matter was already the subject of formal disputes at the WTO, so it should not be on the committee's agenda, the official who attended the meeting said.
Global Yeast Extract and Beta Glucan Market: Snapshot
The global yeast extract and beta glucan market is envisaged to win over a mega growth on the back of an augmenting employment of cellulosic bio-fuels and want for probiotic functional food. Additionally, on account of surging industrialization, the demand for processed food has soared to new heights. As a result, the market could be motivated for more growth. However, one of the major barriers on the growth path of the market is expected to be the paucity of a mandatory yeast extract raw material, i.e. molasses. Nevertheless, manufacturers are expected to keep their hopes alive with opportunities in the processed food sector for novel solutions and various applications of yeast extract and its derivatives.
According to an expert research analysis, the world yeast extract and beta glucan market could attract a valuation of US$1.05 bn by the concluding forecast year 2021. In 2016, the market had attained a revenue figure of US$0.72 bn. For the forecast period 2015–2021, the CAGR anticipated for the market is 7.6%.

Yeast Extract Dominates Beta Glucan with Weighty Demand in Food and Beverage
Amongst the two products available in the global yeast extract and beta glucan market, yeast extract is envisioned to rake in a herculean revenue share of close to 80.0% by 2021. In the starting year of the forecast period, the market share scenario was more or less the same, which depicts the dominance of the yeast extract product type segment.
While yeast extracts may not be used as flavor enhancers, they find extensive usage as ingredients in the food and beverage sector. Functional foods and drinks, baked and frozen products, ready-to-eat meals, snacks, soups, and sauces all use yeast extracts at a significant rate.
Much of the demand for yeast extract could be attributed to its broad scope of applications in various sectors. For instance, depending on the extraction method, it is possible to use yeast extract in the hydrolyzed or autolyzed form with each of them having different applications. In the personal care sector, hydrolyzed yeast extract is utilized in the production of hair conditioning and anti-static products. It is also used a flavoring agent in recipes. Autolyzed yeast extract, on the other hand, could be engaged as an inexpensive alternative to monosodium glutamate (MSG).

Riding on primary contributors such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, India, and China, Asia Pacific is prophesied to make the cut in the international yeast extract and beta glucan market alongside North America. Both the regional markets could secure as good as a 50.0% share by the end of the forecast period. Europe is prognosticated to be crowned as a single leading market shareholder throughout the forecast years. The demand in these regions could be due to the use of yeast extract and beta glucan in the preparation of dairy products, alcoholic beverages, and medicines. There is a rising demand predicted to take precedence in the baking and brewing sector.
An interesting part pointed out by this geographical analysis is the trend of Europe and Rest of the World losing their shares to the promisingly growing markets of Asia Pacific and North America by 2021. By application, the bakery and processed food segment is projected to be valued at a higher revenue in Asia Pacific. Preference for convenience food products, swelling population size, changing food habits, and elevating disposable income are some of the factors influencing the growth of Asia Pacific.
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — The half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was assassinated at an airport in Kuala Lumpur, telling medical workers before he died that he had been attacked with a chemical spray, a Malaysian official said Tuesday.
Kim Jong Nam, 46, was targeted Monday in the shopping concourse at the airport and had not gone through immigration yet for his flight to Macau, said the senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case involves sensitive diplomacy.
He was taken to the airport clinic and then died on the way to the hospital, the official said.
Kim Jong Nam was estranged from his younger brother, the North Korean leader. He had been tipped by outsiders to succeed their dictator father, but reportedly fell out of favor when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He was believed to have been living recently in Macau, Singapore and Malaysia.
Multiple South Korean media reports, citing unidentified sources, said Kim Jong Nam was killed at the airport by two women believed to be North Korean agents. They fled in a taxi and were being sought by Malaysian police, the reports said.
A Malaysian police statement confirmed the death of a 46-year-old North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang on June 10, 1970. “Investigation is in progress and a post mortem examination request has been made to ascertain the cause of death,” the statement said.
Ken Gause, at the CNA think tank in Washington who has studied North Korea's leadership for 30 years, said Kim Chol was a name that Kim Jong Nam has traveled under. He is believed to have been born May 10, 1971, although birthdays are always unclear for senior North Koreans, Gause said.
Mark Tokola, vice president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, said it would be surprising if Kim Jong Nam was not killed on the orders of his brother, given that North Korean agents have reportedly tried to assassinate Kim Jong Nam in the past.
“It seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un,” Tokola wrote in a commentary Tuesday. Although there was scant evidence that Kim Jong Nam was plotting against the North Korean leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who would want to depose his brother.
In Washington, the State Department said it was aware of reports of Kim Jong Nam's death but declined to comment, referring questions to Malaysian authorities.
The reported killing came as North Korea celebrated its latest missile launch, which foreign experts were analyzing for evidence of advancement in the country's missile capabilities. For the next several days, North Korea will be marking the birthday of its late leader Kim Jong Il, the brothers' father, though they have different mothers. The major holiday this Thursday is called the “Day of the Shining Star” and will be feted with figure skating and synchronized swimming exhibitions, fireworks and mass rallies.
Since taking power in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has executed or purged a slew of high-level government officials in what the South Korean government has described as a “reign of terror.” The most spectacular was the 2013 execution by anti-aircraft fire of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, once considered the country's second-most-powerful man, for what the North alleged was treason.
Gause said Kim Jong Nam had been forthright that he did not have political ambitions, although he was publicly critical of the North Korean regime and his brother's legitimacy in the past.
Kim Jong Nam had been less outspoken since 2011, when North Korean assassins reportedly tried to shoot him in Macau, Gause said, though the details of the attempted killing are murky. South Korea also reportedly jailed a North Korean spy in 2012 who admitted to trying to organize a hit-and-run accident targeting Kim Jong Nam in China in 2010.
Despite the attempts on his life, Kim Jong Nam had reportedly traveled to North Korea since then, so it was assumed he was no longer under threat. Kim Jong Nam may have become more vulnerable as his defender in the North Korean hierarchy, Kim Kyong Hui – Kim Jong-un's aunt and the husband of his executed uncle, Jang Song Thaek – appears to have fallen from favor or died. She has not been seen in public for more than three years, Gause said.
Kim Jong Il had at least three sons with two women, as well as a daughter by a third. Kim Jong Nam was the eldest, followed by Kim Jong Chul, who is a few years older than Kim Jong-un and is known as a playboy who reportedly attended Eric Clapton concerts in London in 2015. It's unclear what position he has in the North Korean government. A younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, was named a member of the Workers' Party of Korea's Central Committee during a North Korean party congress last May. She has a position in a propaganda and agitation department and is known as Kim Jong-un's gatekeeper, Gause said.
While the most likely explanation for the killing was that Kim Jong-un was removing a potential challenger to North Korean leadership within his own family, he could also be sending a warning to North Korean officials to demonstrate the reach of the regime. It follows the defection last year of a senior diplomat from the North Korean Embassy in London who has spoken of his despair at Kim's purges.
Evans Revere, a former U.S. diplomat and specialist on East Asia, said the killing did not mean the North Korean regime was unstable. He said it showed Kim Jong-un's brutal control and ability to eliminate opponents or perceived opponents.
Victor Cha, a former White House director for Asian affairs, disagreed.
“He sacks the minister of state security last month and now kills the elder brother. Doesn't look so stable to me,” Cha said.

President Karen Haynes delivered her 13th annual report to address the growth, success and future of CSUSM to the community.
Her speech, “Imagine the Possibilities,” discussed the growth of the university since its foundation 1989. As of 2017, CSUSM has more than 38,000 alumni. In 2016, 35 percent of the graduating class were from underrepresented backgrounds, while 55 percent were first-generation college students.
In her speech, Haynes said CSUSM is underfunded by the state. She said Gov. Jerry Brown's new 2017-18 budget proposal will include funding to cover current employee cost, but won't cover student success, enrollment increases, infrastructure repairs and improvements.
“Whatever our budget outlook, I know that we will continue to make strategic, thoughtful decisions that position us to seize opportunities connected to our core mission,” said Haynes.
After mentioning individual student successes, she challenged the stereotype against college students. 80 percent of CSUSM students don't fit into the young, white, second generation, full-time student who graduates in four years stereotype.
“We are giving our students the real opportunity to imagine the possibilities and turn dreams into realities,” said Haynes.
Faculty, staff, sponsors and community members gathered in Lot N on Feb. 2 at 8 a.m. to hear Haynes' speech.
Approximately 600 attendees came to the event. 13 event sponsors, as listed on the report to the community website, include North City, Tri-City Medical Center, KPBS and San Diego Business Journal.
Haynes concludes her speech by encouraging the community to debunk myths about college students and stand up for public higher education.
“Today's big, audacious dreams with intention and determination become tomorrow's progress.”
APRIL 24, 2018 — Fiscal Year 2017 was a record drug-busting year for the U.S. Coast Guard. Working with its interagency partners, it seized 455,000 pounds (227.5 tons) of cocaine with a wholesale value estimated at $6 billion.
That effort to combat illegal drug trafficking has not slowed in FY 2018. The Coast Guard reports that this morning, the crew of the 270 ft USCG Cutter Legare, based out of Portsmouth, VA, was set to offload about 12 tons of cocaine and 1 ton of marijuana in Port Everglades worth an estimated $390 million. The drugs were seized in international waters in the Eastern Pacific off the coasts of Mexico, Central, and South America by multiple U.S. Coast Guard cutters and Canadian Naval vessels during 17 separate suspected drug smuggling vessel interdictions.
“What these numbers represent is an increased commitment by U.S. and international partners to combat transnational criminal networks and promote stability in the Central American region, along the U.S. southern border, and in the southern maritime approaches to the U.S.,” said Cmdr. Jonathan Carter, commanding officer of Legare.
One of the Canadian Navy vessels working with the U.S. Coast Guard was the HMCS Whitehorse, which was responsible for seizing about 1,540 kilograms of cocaine during two drug interdictions.

Rep. Adam Schiff Weighs In On How Memo Could Affect House Intelligence Investigation
NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, about the newly released GOP-Nunes memo, the Democratic memo and how this affects the committee's investigation.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
Three days ago, the president said he would release it 100 percent. Today the White House authorized its declassification, and now the memo is out. This would be the memo from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee alleging that the FBI and Justice Department abused surveillance powers to target the Trump campaign and to spy on Trump adviser Carter Page. The memo says biased FBI agents didn't disclose that the evidence they used to get a warrant came out of paid Democratic opposition research, and that the former British spy who compiled that opposition research was, quote, "desperate that Trump not get elected."
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Democrats and the intelligence community strongly objected to the release of this memo, including Adam Schiff, the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, who joins us now. Congressman Schiff, welcome.
ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you. It's good to be with you.
SHAPIRO: You've read the intelligence behind this memo, and you've said the final product that was made public today has dramatic omissions and Distortions. What are the biggest offenses in your view?
SCHIFF: Well, the biggest offense, frankly, is all that this leaves out. Now, there are some things that are in the memo that are just plain false. But the bigger problem is it gives you only cherry-picked facts from the FISA application. Now, you can imagine with any lengthy document you can pull a piece here and you can pull a piece there and you can use it to paint a portrait that would be critical of whoever wrote the document. And that's what they've done.
SHAPIRO: So are you saying there was other evidence besides the Steele dossier that went into the FISA application?
SCHIFF: Of course. And not only was there other evidence beside the Steele dossier, the way they characterize it as if the entire Steele dossier, including the salacious allegations of this video, were somehow submitted to the FISA court - that's not correct. There were portions of the work that Christopher Steele did that there were pertinent to Carter Page that were included, and some were corroborated. And there was a lot of other information presented about Carter Page, who had come to the attention of the FBI years before he had any affiliation with the Trump campaign, in connection with a Russian intelligence operation in New York. None of that is laid out in this document.
And the FBI and the Department of Justice are quite right. It's really not only reckless, but misleading for them to do this. The procedure they used to publish this document has never been used before, and for good reason. The Congress shouldn't be cherry-picking intelligence and publishing it for political reasons.
SHAPIRO: Of course, you and the Democrats on the committee have a rebuttal memo, which is still classified, and House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he supports releasing it. Have you been given any assurances about when or if your version of events will be made public?
SCHIFF: No, we haven't. We're going to try to force a vote on it on Monday. I think the Republicans know it's really unsustainable for them to claim they're doing this in the interest of transparency but refuse to let the country see the response to it. More than that, though, this whole idea that they're just doing appropriate oversight ignores the fact that we wanted - we, the Democrats, wanted the FBI to come in and have a chance to answer questions from the committee about anything the Republicans were raising, and they didn't want to hear the answers.
So if they had concerns about anything left out of the FISA application they could have asked the FBI, was this included or why it wasn't included? And the FBI would've had a chance to say, actually, we did include this information, and if you look here you'll see we did, and this other information wasn't known to us at the time. They could give explanations, but that's not really what the Republicans wanted.
SHAPIRO: You know, one lingering question is whether the White House had any role in the drafting of this memo. The committee chairman, Devin Nunes, refused to answer that question. Do you have any insight into that?
SCHIFF: Well, I don't. Of course, it wouldn't surprise me because this whole memo business is a continuation of what the chairman began when he went on that now-infamous midnight run to the White House and then later presented documents to the White House that he said he had discovered from some secret source only to find out that the documents he was presenting he had obtained from the White House. So...
SHAPIRO: And he then recused himself from the Russia investigation.
SCHIFF: He was forced to recuse himself but never really did. And he really should have. And I think his continued participation in the investigation just brings discredit upon it. We...
SHAPIRO: And in the final seconds we have, your colleagues, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, have called on the speaker to remove Congressman Nunes as intelligence committee chair. Do you agree with them?
SCHIFF: I do agree with them, although considering the fact that the speaker of the House, who makes that decision, wasn't willing to weigh in when the FBI said that this was and the Department said this was extraordinarily reckless - tells you that the speaker is not going to look out for the - not only the institution, but the interest of justice. This rule presupposes that the president will exercise discretion if Congress should ever use the process, but clearly here you have a president who simply didn't care.
SHAPIRO: Congressman Schiff, thank you very much.
SCHIFF: Thank you.
SHAPIRO: Congressman Adam Schiff of California is the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

LAHORE-Sean Tubby and Andy Gove have travelled all the way from England on their African Twin bikes to explore the beauty of the world. These days they are in heart of Pakistan that is Lahore. The trip of a lifetime will see them explore no less than 20 countries. They left England in August and headed for the continent, where they set their sights on Germany, for a lap of the Nürburgring, before heading through Eastern Europe towards Turkey.
After visiting Lahore they are all set to leave for India through Wagah. From there the trip will continue through the largely untouched roads of Myanmar and continue through South East Asia to Vietnam. In an exclusive interview with The Nation they talked about their journey and difficulties they faced during the tour. Following are the excerpts of the interview:
What inspired you to travel towards Pakistan?
Sean Tubby: I am visiting Pakistan to promote the message that it is a peaceful country and safe for the tourists. It is a heaven which is unexplored.
Andy Gove: Not many people do it so we thought we should.
Which was the place you travelled in Pakistan and how was your experience?
Sean Tubby: Pakistan was the easiest border crossing we have had. In fact, it took longer to leave Iran than enter Pakistan. A well spoken gentleman walked us through the procedure, while border staff and money changers came to stare at us with interested and slightly bewildered expressions. We were then sent up the road through a set of huge and ornate gates that were promptly opened ajar to let our bikes through. Half a dozen smartly dressed soldiers with neatly trimmed beards sat us down at a garden table with easy smiles. They then took our details and were amused and confused in equal measure about the fact that our passports had the words Northern Ireland printed on the front.
The western part of Pakistan, from Taftan to Quetta, is considered quite dangerous; this is due to the fact that human traffickers, drug smugglers and the odd religious zealot, bent on beheading foreigners, roam the endless desert applying their trade. This meant we could not travel anywhere without a security escort, and moving after 2pm is prohibited. So, we were put up in the local police station for the night, where we slept on the floor of one of the offices. To travel overland, the Levies will run you between check points, where you are passed onto the next group of officers. The checkpoints vary from mud huts with oil drums full of rocks as barriers, to fully blown military outposts, where your documents are triple checked, while the soulless barrel of an LMG tracks your movements. The eyes of its operator can be seen just behind, darting nervously from us to the officer in charge. It was the western part of Pakistan, from Taffan to Quetta.
The real issue was the relentless heat, Pakistan is hot, like, really hot and our escorts would only drive at the mind bending, soul destroyingly slow speed of 40 miles per hour. We were riding through golden sands, that rose and fell like the waves of the sea. Palm trees started to appear as the road led us to the base of an epic and unforgiving mountain range.
Andy Gove: We have discovered mostly areas of northern side of Pakistan and the experience is really amazing. We cannot express our thanks enough for everything out friends in Pakistan have done for us. Such an incredible country with the most amazing people. We shall miss you Pakistan.
What do you think is the appeal of jumping on a motorcycle and riding around the world?
Sean Tubby: It feels great to get around and get involved with the world directly – to be close to it, to have a real exposure to people and conditions.
Andy Gove: You get a chance to discover the places and its ground realities.
While doing adventure on bike what should a person carry in his kit bag?
Sean Tubby: Tools and spare parts should be complete. Your tent is your home so, don't forget to carry it.
Andy Gove: My essentials are an impregnated mosquito net, helmet, waterproof boots, proper tools, spare parts and my camera.
What is the worst road you have ridden on?
Sean Tubby: It was the parts of Karakoram highway where we had to face land sliding. Other than that it was the best road for bike riding.
For a motorcycle enthusiast who wants to travel from UK to Pakistan on a bike how much does it cost?
Sean Tubby: If he/she wants to finish in Pakistan it will cost around 4,000 pounds.
What's Next any new trip planned?
Sean Tubby: We are heading towards India via Wagah border. Andy Gove: I guess we should first finish this one and then will make new trip plan.
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Ambassador to the UAE, Moazzam Ahmed Khan, said that a win-win situation can be created in the region if UAE joins the CPEC fold like other countries. The envoy said that Pakistan and China were working on huge projects on infrastructure, roads and railway networks. Most importantly, both countries are also investing in the energy sector.
During an interview, he spoke about how both countries could benefit from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a part of China's ambitious One Belt, One Road multi-billion dollar initiative, and also part of Pakistan's Vision 2025.
He described it as an ideal investment opportunity for Emirati investors, Moazzam noted that the UAE was the second largest Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) trade partner of Pakistan, with a trade surplus of US$5 billion.
Moreover, Pakistani nationals send US$4.5 billion in remittances each year from the UAE to their home country.
“The UAE is already one of the main investment partners in Pakistan. In fact, according to some estimates, it is the third largest investor,” the ambassador said, “So there will be huge opportunities coming from this project, for all countries of the region.
He said in the last few years, UAE companies have invested billions of dollars in all major sectors, particularly banking, infrastructure and communications.
These sectors, the envoy said, provide ample opportunities for further investment, as Pakistan's fast-expanding economy expects to achieve 5.5% GDP growth this year.
Two weeks ago TechCrunch called on Instagram to build an equivalent to Facebook's “Download Your Information feature so if you wanted to leave for another photo sharing network, you could. The next day it announced this tool would be coming and now TechCrunch has spotted it rolling out to users. Instagram's “Data Download” feature can be accessed here or through the app's privacy settings. It lets users export their photos, videos, archived Stories, profile, info, comments, and non-ephemeral messages, though it can take a few hours to days for your download to be ready.
An Instagram spokesperson now confirms to TechCrunch that “the Data Download tool is currently accessible to everyone on the web, but access via iOS and Android is still rolling out.” We'll have more details on exactly what's inside once my download is ready.
The tool's launch is necessary for Instagram to comply with the data portability rule in European Union's GDPR privacy law that goes into effect on May 25th. But it's also a reasonable concession. Instagram has become the dominant image sharing social network with over 800 million users. It shouldn't need to lock up users' data in order to keep them around.
Instagram hasn't been afraid to attack competitors and fight dirty. Most famously, it copied Snapchat's Stories in August 2016, which now has over 300 million daily users — eclipsing the original. But it also cut off GIF-making app Phhhoto from its Find Friends feature, then swiftly cloned its core feature to launch Instagram Boomerang. Within a few years, Phhhoto had shut down its app.
If Instagram is going to ruthlessly clone and box out its competitors, it should also let users choose which they want to use. That's tough if all your photos and videos are trapped inside another app. The tool could create a more level playing field for competition amongst photo apps.
It could also deter users from using sketchy third-party apps to scrape all their Instagram content. Since they typically require you to log in with your Instagram credentials, these put users at risk of being hacked or having their images used elsewhere without their consent. Considering Facebook launched its DYI tool in 2010, six years after the site launched, the fact that it took Instagram 8 years from launch to build this means it's long overdue.
But with such strong network effect and its willingness to clone any popular potential rival, it may still take a miracle or a massive shift to a new computing platform for any app to dethrone Instagram.
BERLIN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the Social Democrats (SPD) were haggling on Friday over labour rights after securing a flurry of agreements on less contentious issues in their talks on forming a new coalition government.
The two camps aim to finalise a deal for four more years of a “grand coalition” by the end of the weekend or early next week, some four months after an inconclusive national election plunged Germany into unaccustomed political uncertainty.
The parties have agreed to some eye-catching measures, including a 50 percent tax write-down for fleet electric cars and a 12 billion euro public investment programmes to improve sluggish data networks, documents seen by Reuters showed.
But in the field of labour rights, where the beleaguered SPD wants to signal to its members that it has set its distinctive stamp on the deal, long lines of text highlighted in yellow showed that the parties had still reached no consensus.
The SPD wants to secure a right for employees in larger companies to move seamlessly back and forth between full- and part-time work if they have to care for children or elderly parents. The conservatives, and much of German business, oppose what they see as a costly measure.
The centre-left SPD has sagged even further in opinion polls since suffering its worst result of the postwar era in the Sept. 24 election.
Many SPD activists, who must ratify any coalition deal in a postal ballot, would prefer to see their party reinvent itself in opposition rather than join another coalition with Merkel after serving as junior partner in one from 2013 to 2017.
For Merkel, another loveless ‘grand coalition' is her best chance of securing a fourth term after the failure of earlier talks with two smaller parties late last year.
Her conservative bloc and the SPD have already agreed terms in other areas. Germany's booming economy has allowed them to agree an extra 11 billion euros for education, and compromise deals have been reached on migration and healthcare policy.
Some of the accords are noticeably less ambitious than those reached in the previous talks with the two smaller parties. Then, negotiators agreed to spend 20 billion euros over a longer period on building a better national broadband network. Privatisations are also now off the agenda.

More than 1,000 migrants tried to jump a high double fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Ceuta on Sunday in a violent assault that saw one officer lose an eye, local authorities said.
A group of 1,100 people from Sub-Saharan Africa trying to reach Europe stormed the border fence just after 4 am (0300 GMT) on New Year´s Day in an “extremely violent and organised” way, said the central government´s representative office in Ceuta.
None however managed to get through bar two who were badly injured and taken to hospital in Ceuta, the office said in a statement. A similar assault on December 9 saw more than 400 migrants enter the tiny enclave.
They tried “to force open some of the doors in the external fence, using iron bars, wire cutters and large stones with which they assaulted Moroccan forces and (Spanish) Guardia Civil (police) agents,” it added.
Five Spanish policemen and 50 members of the Moroccan forces were injured, including one who lost an eye, it said.
Ceuta along with Melilla, another Spanish territory in North Africa, have the European Union´s only land borders with Africa. They are one of the entry points for African migrants seeking a better life in Europe, who get there by either climbing over the border fence or by swimming along the coast.—AFP

Two high ranking Trump administration officials; two vastly different positions on marijuana. Attorney General Jeff Sessions wants to revive the war on drugs, and a crackdown on weed appears to be a major part of that. He is expected to pursue harsher punishments for using and distributing marijuana, which were relaxed under U.S. President Trump's predecessor, as The Washington Post's Sari Horowitz has reported. “Good people don't smoke marijuana,” Sessions opined last year. It's a far cry from what Department of Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said about the drug Sunday. Read the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Kelly told host Chuck Todd that marijuana was “not a factor” in the war on drugs and argued that “arresting a lot of users” wasn't the right solution to the country's drug problems.

Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, was discussing border enforcement when Todd asked him if legalizing marijuana would help or hurt his efforts to control the flow of drugs into the United States. “Yeah, marijuana is not a factor in the drug war,” Kelly said. He continued: “It's three things. Methamphetamine. Almost all produced in Mexico. Heroin. Virtually all produced in Mexico. And cocaine that comes up from further south.”

Last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said “good people don't smoke marijuana." ( Susan Walsh / The Associated Press )
Those three drugs, Kelly added, had killed more than 50,000 people in the United States in 2015, along with opiates, and had cost the country some $332 billion. Before joining the Trump administration, Kelly served as the head of U.S. Southern Command, overseeing security operations for Central America, South America and the Caribbean. In that role, he confronted issues related to the trafficking of narcotics, including heroin and cocaine, into the United States. Kelly made similar remarks on marijuana in a November interview with MilitaryTimes. He told the publication he was opposed to illegal and recreational drug use generally, and was critical of marijuana legalization, but said he supported using pot for medical purposes. “Whether it's veterans or anyone else, if it helps those people, then fine,” he said. “Medicine is medicine.” On that issue, he could hardly be more removed from Sessions, who has balked at the idea that marijuana could be used as a painkiller or treatment for opioid addiction. “I've heard people say we could solve our heroin problem with marijuana,” he said in a speech last month. “How stupid is that?” Sessions later told reporters he believed “medical marijuana has been hyped, maybe too much,” as The Post reported. In the same speech, he said his office may reexamine Obama administration policies that left marijuana legalization in the hands of states. Unlike Sessions, Kelly doesn't have much say in how the United States prosecutes drug offenders. But in his Meet the Press appearance Sunday, he argued in favor of reducing demand for drugs rather than punishing drug users. “The solution is not arresting a lot of users,” he said. “The solution is a comprehensive drug demand reduction program in the United States that involves every man and woman of goodwill. And then rehabilitation. And then law enforcement. And then getting at the poppy fields and the coca fields in the south.”

The most beautiful animal you can have
BASIL the greyhound was nothing short of a gentleman, but unfortunately, like other greyhounds in his position, he'd become a permanent fixture at the pet shelter.
The number of greyhounds in shelters, due to the State Government's phasing out of greyhound racing, showed no sign of slowing, prompting RSPCA staff and volunteers to bring awareness of the issue to the community.

It is important for youth involved in fair exhibitions at the local level to understand how to protect the health of their animals, safeguard their personal health, look after the public that attend exhibitions and protect the fair from the consequences of disease. County fairs and jackpot shows bring together pigs from many areas and health status and at times disease can spread quickly when pigs from different areas are comingled at events like these. If illness is a result of the comingling of pigs, people can also be at risk for infection from zoonotic diseases. Michigan State University Extension recommends taking proper precautions so that your pigs will be unaffected or less affected when they come into contact with a disease like swine influenza. These precautions can decrease the clinical signs (coughing and sneezing) that pigs express, therefore better protecting exhibitors and the public from different zoonotic illnesses.
As with any zoonotic disease there is a concern that people may become sick from exposure to pigs that are carrying virus and may be contagious. Taking simple precautions such as washing your hands and being vigilant when you observe your animals can help protect the health of pigs and people. When you come into contact with animals, it is important to practice good hygiene and wash your hands using soap and water. If access to soap and water is limited, using hand sanitizer can also be beneficial. Many times, viruses are transmitted via oral and nasal mucosa and expelled when the animal coughs or sneezes. Eliminating food and drink consumption by humans around animals is a known method to reduce the transfer virus. When you see others eating or drinking in the exhibition area, be an advocate of your industry and politely ask them to remove food from the area, as this will help keep the pigs and people from getting sick.
Swine influenza (SIV) is a respiratory disease caused by type A influenza virus. This zoonotic disease is contagious among pigs and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some strains have been reported to infect the human population, specifically in Michigan during the summer exhibition season the last few years. Influenza can be characterized in swine by clinical signs such as coughing, fever, sneezing and lethargic acting animals. Swine can also be asymptomatic, which means that you may not notice that your pig is sick. This disease typically runs its course in approximately three to seven days.
This is why daily observation of changes in health status of the swine exhibited is also important. If you do notice your animal express signs of illness while you are at the county fair or exhibition, it is important to talk to the event leadership. Working with the fair veterinarian if an animal becomes sick and taking the appropriate steps to isolate or remove that animal from exhibit can help decrease the spread of disease in the swine area and stop exposure to people. If you become sick and have signs of respiratory illness it is important to notify your doctor that you have had close proximity to swine so that the correct diagnoses can be made.
It is also important to understand that influenza virus, including H3N2 is not a food safety threat and swine influenza is not transmissible by consuming pork or pork products. Properly prepared pork is safe to consume and people should not be concerned with contracting influenza caused by the influenza virus.
Safeguarding your health and the public is an important role for swine exhibitors, as they are ambassadors of the agriculture industry and should lead by example when working with animals.

MADISON, Wis. (AP)  University of Wisconsin System leaders approved a policy Friday that calls for suspending and expelling students who disrupt campus speeches and presentations, saying students need to listen to all sides of issues and arguments.
The Board of Regents adopted the language on a voice vote during a meeting at the University of Wisconsin-Stout in Menomonie. The policy states that students found to have twice engaged in violence or other disorderly conduct that disrupts others' free speech would be suspended. Students found to have disrupted others' free expression three times would be expelled.
"Perhaps the most important thing we can do as a university is to teach students how to engage and listen to those with whom they differ," system President Ray Cross told the regents. "If we don't show students how to do this, who will? Without civil discourse and a willingness to listen and engage with different voices, all we are doing is reinforcing our existing values."
The policy comes amid complaints from conservatives across the U.S. that right-leaning speakers aren't afforded the same level of respect on campuses as liberal presenters. Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2016 shouted down and traded obscene gestures with ex-Breitbart editor and conservative columnist Ben Shapiro.

The University of California-Berkeley canceled an appearance by right-wing firebrand Milo Yiannopoulus in September. Four protests have turned violent on that campus and in the nearby city in recent months.
The new Wisconsin policy mirrors Republican legislation the state Assembly passed in June, though the Senate has yet to act on the bill.
Regents President John Robert Behling told the board before Friday's vote that adopting the policy ahead of the legislation shows "a responsiveness to what's going on in the Capitol, which helps build relationships."
Republican Gov. Scott Walker appointed all but two of the board's 18 members. State public schools Superintendent Tony Evers and Wisconsin Technical College System Board President Mark Tyler are automatically regents by virtue of their offices.
Evers, a Democrat running against Walker in next year's gubernatorial election, cast the only dissenting vote. He accused the regents of sacrificing free speech to curry favor with Republican lawmakers.
"This policy will chill and suppress free speech on this campus and all campuses," Evers said.
Other Democratic opponents charge that the policy doesn't clearly define what type of conduct is considered disruptive.
"Who's going to show up to a protest if they think they could be potentially expelled?" Democratic state Rep. Chris Taylor, whose district includes the flagship Madison campus, said during a Thursday news conference on the policy.
A senior at the university, Savion Castro, accused the regents of "capitulating to a band of right-wing extremists."
"The First Amendment is supposed to be messy and contentious and allow contentious debate," Castro said during the news conference. "The whole point of protest is to disrupt the status quo and make people uncomfortable."
Regent Regina Millner defended the resolution at the meeting, saying it's designed to promote listening.
"I don't consider drowning out another speaker as freedom of speech," Millner said. "That doesn't qualify."
The policy won't take effect until the system writes administrative rules implementing it and Walker and lawmakers sign off on them. That process that could take months.

ISLAMABAD, July 4 (APP):Chinese and Pakistani frontier defence forces conduct joint patrol at a mountainous region in Khunjerab in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region last week.
They were respectively assigned to a frontier defence company in Khunjerab under the PLA Xinjiang Military Command (MC) and the border police of the Pakistani Khunjerab Security Force (KSF), a leading China's defence journal ‘ China Military' reported on Wednesday.
The Chinese and Pakistan frontier defence forces discussed Chinese-Pakistan border situation during the joint border patrol.
The troops from both Chinese and Pakistani frontier defence forces saluted each other prior to the patrol and also engaged in a friendly competition of arm wrestling during the short break.
Lahore - The main I-Day ceremony in Islamabad was to be held at Parliament premises but it had to be arranged at the Convention Centre this time too because of inclement weather, according to a BBC report.
When President Mamnoon was delivering his speech yesterday, there was a noise created by buzzing of the children and flapping of the plastic flags they were hoisting.
Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa took notice of it and told a security staff to make them quiet. That man conveyed the order to another security guy who waved to the children and then put his finger on lips. The gesture worked and the noise began to subside.
When Prime Minister Khaqan Abbasi came in there, he went straight to his seat. But, the president, the senate chairman and national assembly speaker shook hands with the high command of the armed forces and other dignitaries sitting in front two rows, before taking their seats.
All the attendants stood in their seats and clapped for the Chinese deputy premier when he returned after delivering his speech, but only a few people gave a standing ovation to President Mamnoon Hussain.
News Desk
ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP): President Mamnoon Hussain Monday urged the nation to bury their differences and get united for the stability and development of the country.

The bilateral ties were significant ones in the context of regional cooperation and stability, he added.
Amid huge applause by the audience, the president said certain issues confronted by the country also required review by all and sundry. The countrymen should find ways to resolve these issues.
He said the nations in the world had faced myriad issues but they rose up after mustering strength from trials and tribulations.
He stressed that emulation of basic principles in life and sticking to the rule of law by individuals in their personal lives could help achieve marvels.
The president said the national issues should be judged in their true aspects without giving way to emotional tendencies.
He noted that democratic and parliamentary system reflected the desire of the whole nation and urged the nation to rise above ethnicities and minor divides and work for the solidarity and stability of the country.
He urged the nation to get united under the Constitution and ensure its supremacy which was vital for development of the country.

"Attack on Titan" has a new Nintendo 3DS visual novel game that will let players experience being part of the Survey Corps. But the player will need to do more than move about in the game; he must be able to bond with different characters in the animated series including familiar characters like Eren, Mikasa, Levi and the others.
The game is set during the Battle of Trost as the Survey Corps were investigating an old castle. The team enters the castle and begins their search when a Titan attacks outside the structure. The floor collapses and they fall to the basement floor of the castle. Because of the fall, they break their 3D maneuver gear. The player is an original part of the team and will bond with different characters to be able to get out of the castle, Anime News Network reported.
The new "Attack on Titan" game will be available a month from now and to increase fans' anticipation, a new teaser video has been released. Siliconera reports that the new trailer featured the main cast Eren, Levi and Mikasa being introduced in the game. Included in the teaser were several shots from the manga, maps and more. Entitled "Attack on Titan: Escape From Certain Death," the video also announced that it will be released on March 30, 2017 in Japan.

There are two different versions of the game. The "Attack on Titan" standard edition costs 5,800 yen or $53 USD and the Treasure Box edition is 12,800 yen or $118 USD. The Treasure Box includes freebies like a visual book, a soundtrack, large tin Survey Corps badges, waterproof posters of the cast and 3DS themes with original voices of Levi and Mikasa.
Ruby Party team from KOEI Tecmo is the developer of "Attack on Titan" 3DS game. The team has created the game together with the help of the visual staff of the series' anime version.
With fitness gadgets fading fast, and the smartwatch category gathering flies, it's strange to report a blazing success in wearables. Even stranger, it hasn't come from an established consumer electronics brand or even a “wearable company”.
And it has sold tens of millions with few people noticing.
The latest pair of products in Mobvoi's TicWatch line have gathered $2.5m in pledges on Kickstarter, with a few days still to go. It's even stranger when you consider it's actually a speech company.
Mobvoi describes itself as “the only firm in China equipped with its own Chinese voice recognition, semantic analytics, and search technologies.” Two Google engineers who had been working for Alphabet on speech recognition set up the company in Beijing, with the company injecting its engine into the WeChat platform in China. That attracted car giant Mercedes and Google as investors, and Mobvoi funding to date tops $250m.
Ticwatch E
Ticwatch S
The first Ticwatch was launched three years ago – in China initially – using a forked version of Android Wear (“TicOS”), with its own API. The latest models are fully Wear 2 compatible.
TicWatch 2 came (also with help from a Kickstarter drive) last year, landing with a $169 price tag – around half the price of rivals from Huawei and LG. Design partners Frog incorporated a touch-sensitive strip on the side, which helps with scrolling and zooming, and ensured there were some decent quality strap options. So even before the current Kickstarter, Ticwatch had a reputation for being cheaper, good looking, and less clunky that heavyweight Wear competitors. You can see the UI tweaks here:

Mobvoi shuns Qualcomm for Mediatek's MTK MT2601 chipset in its two new watches, and there's no NFC. It's claimed the 300mAh battery lasts two days. The display on each model is a 1.4inch OLED (287dpi), and they're waterproof.
The MSRP will be $159 for the E and $199 for the S. The Kickstarter pages can be found here. ®

The only person convicted in the Air India bombing has been released from a halfway house and can now live wherever he chooses.
Inderjit Singh Reyat — who has spent most of his adult life behind bars — was convicted of perjury in 2010 for his testimony as a Crown witness at the 2003 trial of Ripudamen Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri.
Malik and Bagri were acquitted of mass murder and conspiracy charges in the June 23, 1985 bombing that sent an Air India jet into the Irish Sea, killing all 331 people aboard.
Reyat was sentenced to nine years, which is believed to be the longest prison sentence for perjury in Canadian history.
WATCH: From the Global BC Archive: Inderjit Singh Reyat is sentenced to nine years in prison for perjury. Brian Coxford reports. Original air date: January 7, 2011.
Last January, he was given a statutory release after serving two-thirds of his sentence.
Reyat spent that time at a halfway house and told the parole board he has renounced violence and presents a low risk to public safety.

He can now return to living with his family. He is still subject to some parole board conditions, including not participating in political activities and having no contact with the victims' families.
In 2003 — as Malik and Bagri were on trial for murder — Reyat pleaded guilty to a third, single count of manslaughter for his role in the downing of Flight 182 and was called to testify at their trial.

Well, that didn't go as planned. For many, though, it went as expected.
With the Calgary Flames' losing streak in Anaheim now approaching 30 games, the team will no doubt be looking forward to playing Game 3 tonight in the comfy confines of the Saddledome.
Prior to the series starting, we looked at how important it was for the Flames to pick up at least one win in Anaheim. Throwing the monkey off their back early in this series would have been a huge boost to a team that has the Ducks living in their heads by now.
Now, the team faces a mountain of a challenge in getting back into this series.
Digging Their Own Grave
It was clear before the series began that, to have a chance, the Flames were going to have to stick to their style of play and keep it as clean a series as possible. Getting sucked into stupid penalties at inopportune times was the last thing the players could afford to do against the Ducks, and they all knew it.
Game 1 saw the Flames hand Anaheim seven power plays. The Ducks scored on two of them and won the game by a single goal.
Following the loss, and prior to Game 2, Dougie Hamilton had this to say about taking mindless penalties:
Hamilton followed that up by taking a brain-dead penalty late in the third period of Game 2, which led to the Ducks scoring the winning goal off Lance Bouma's skate. New game, same mistakes from Dougie.
It's simple: if the Flames continue to take the bulk of the penalties in this series, it will be short. Like, not even get back to Anaheim short.
Wake-Up Calls
Beyond the penalties, Hamilton has not been up to par through the first two games, but he's not alone.
The Flames came into this series as underdogs, which meant that to have any chance at winning, they would need their best players to continue to be just that and more. So far, the top guns have been mostly invisible, or visible in the worst ways.
Up front, Sean Monahan is the only player in the top-six who has pulled his weight so far. Johnny Gaudreau does one thing for the team, and that's score. Yet Calgary's most exciting player has been mostly invisible through the first two games and has one assist to show for it.
The “3M” line of Mikael Backlund, Michael Frolik and Matthew Tkachuk was Calgary's best line throughout the regular season. Known for producing while also shutting down opposing team's top lines, and dominating the possession in the process, they managed to each register a Corsi percentage (CF%) above 55 in the regular season. Through the first to games of this series, they're all below 44% and have two points between the three of them.
It's easy to cut Tkachuk some slack, as he is a rookie. It's also tempting to go easy on Michael Ferland, who has done a lot of the right things in registering 10 shots on goal despite failing to collect a point so far.
The problem with this thinking is that both Tkachuk and Ferland have been instrumental in the Flames' successes this season. Without their contributions, they wouldn't even be in the postseason, so not having these guys going now means that whole team will be golfing by next week. They have to step it up.
The Blueprint Is There
It's not all doom and gloom.
When these teams met in the playoffs two seasons ago, the Ducks made quick work of the Flames in five games, thoroughly dominating the series. The same can't really be said this time around, despite the team finding themselves in a similarly daunting hole. The Flames have been in every game, and have had the chance to win both games.
Losing both contests by a single goal, and having only been out-shot by one (70-69) in the two games at the Honda Center combined, the Flames are right there. Stupid mistakes and a lack of finish from some players have been the difference so far. These shouldn't be complicated fixes.
The old cliché says that you aren't really in trouble until you lose at home. Frankly, I don't buy into that thinking, but it might help if Glen Gulutzan and his players do. Some stronger play by the team's best players, and – most importantly – improved discipline will go a long way to getting the Flames back into this series.
The series isn't over yet. Lose tonight, though, and it will be. It's time for each player to look in the mirror, and start practicing what they preach.

PALLEKELE, Sri Lanka, Aug 12 (Reuters) - India captain Virat Kohli won the toss and opted to bat in the third and final test against Sri Lanka on Saturday as the tourists bid to complete a series whitewash over the hosts.
Following wins inside four days in Galle and Colombo, the world's top-ranked side have an unassailable 2-0 lead and the injury-hit hosts face another stiff task against Kohli's men in the finale.
Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav will play his second test for India after the 22-year-old made his debut at home against Australia in March.
He was the only change for the touring side, called up as a replacement for suspended left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja.
"It's a no-brainer, we are going to bat first," Kohli said at the toss. "It (pitch) is similar to the second game but not as dry. We want to take advantage of the best batting conditions."
The hosts have been hurt by injuries throughout the series and will be missing both spin spearhead Rangana Herath and paceman Nuwan Pradeep. Middle-order batsman Dhananjaya de Silva was dropped after scores of nought and 17 in Colombo.
Sri Lanka brought in left-arm wrist-spinner Lakshan Sandakan, along with pace duo Lahiru Kumara and Vishwa Fernando.
"To be honest we would also have batted first. You can't control the toss but we just want to restrict them to the minimum we can," Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal said.
"As a young team we just want to win a game and keep that spirit going forward."
Teams:
India: Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli (captain), Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin, Wriddhiman Saha (wicketkeeper), Hardik Pandya, Umesh Yadav, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami.
Sri Lanka: Upul Tharanga, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal (captain), Angelo Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella (wicketkeeper), Dilruwan Perera, Malinda Pushpakumara, Lakshan Sandakan, Vishwa Fernando, Lahiru Kumara. (Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; Editing by John O'Brien)
Foreign investors have boosted their won-denominated bond holdings so far this year, industry data showed Tuesday, despite growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
Foreign inflows to the South Korean bond market also came in spite of the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates this year.
(Yonhap)
Offshore investors have purchased a net 16.5 trillion won ($14.5 billion) worth of won-denominated bonds as of last Friday, raising their holdings to 99.3 trillion won.During the first 15 days of this month, when concerns about North Korea rose, foreign investors bought 2.9 trillion won worth of South Korean bonds, according to the data.Tensions between North Korea and the US have risen in recent weeks as Pyongyang test-launched a series of ballistic missiles, prompting the US to issue hawkish warnings against the North.US Vice President Mike Pence, who visited South Korea this week, warned North Korea that "all options are on the table" in dealing with Pyongyang's defiant pursuit of nuclear and missile programs.Kang Seung-won, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities, said foreign central banks and sovereign funds were among net buyers of South Korean bonds.Kang said this year's foreign inflows to the South Korean bond market bucked the trend, given historical market data that showed investor sentiment towards won-denominated assets had become weaker when geopolitical risks surrounding North Korea soared.

ISLAMABAD - Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that Pakistan and the United States were partners in the journey to development both in the socioeconomic and defence sector.
Speaking to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on the telephone, Asif said that he would strive in his new capacity to strengthen the partnership with the US.
Tillerson had called Asif to felicitate on the 70th Independence Day anniversary of Pakistan, said a statement issued here by the foreign ministry.
In the recent past, Pak-US ties have been tense. The tension started last year when the US refused to share the price of the F-16 jets that were to be sold to Pakistan an­d it reached its peak when Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour was killed in Balochistan in a US drone strike. Pakistan protested against the extension of the drone attacks but the US refused to budge an inch. Washington has also shown its tilt towards India on international issues.
Last month, Pentagon withheld $50 million to be paid under the Coalition Support Fund to Pakistan. US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said at a meeting of the Congressional defence committees that he was unable to verify Pakistan's efforts against the Haqqani group. Islamabad said Pakistan will not give up its right to CSF and convince the US to release the funds as soon as possible.
Asif said the telephone call from Washington on the 70th anniversary of Pakistan's Independence Day was an apt reminder of the long history of relations between the two countries, said the foreign ministry statement.
The foreign minister said that the US had been a partner in Pakistan's progress in the socioeconomic and defence sector.
The foreign minister said that the current leadership of Pakistan was committed to establishing Pakistan's vital relations with the US. He underscored the need to build a dynamic and diverse relationship underpinned by mutual trust, sincerity, and confidence. He said Pakistan would benefit the most if peace and stability were achieved in Afghanistan as the success and sustainability of Pakistan's economic reforms depended upon a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. He expressed Pakistan's willingness to work with the US once the policy review on Afghanistan was unveiled.
He emphasized the political settlement of the conflict in the Afghanistan as the common objective of Pakistan and the US.
“Secretary Tillerson extended an invitation to the foreign minister to visit the United States to carry on the conversation. The foreign minister also invited Secretary Tillerson to visit Pakistan. Secretary Tillerson accepted the invitation,” said the statement. Tillerson conveyed the best wishes on behalf of the US government and the American people to the government and people of Pakistan.
The US Secretary of State also congratulated Asif on assumption of office as Foreign Minister of Pakistan and expressed his desire to work with him for achieving common objectives, said the statement.
Earlier in the day, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Pak-China friendship will further strengthen in days to come.
Speaking to journalists after seeing off the Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang, he said the visit of Chinese high-level delegation to Pakistan will help boost the bilateral relations between the two countries.
Asif said the change in the Prime Minister's office in Pakistan will not affect the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.
SHAFQAT ALI
MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump spelled out in new detail several steps he favors to fight a U.S. epidemic of opioid abuse, including the execution of drug dealers, a proposal that has gained little support from drug abuse and judicial experts.
At an event in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump unveiled an anti-opioid abuse plan, including his death penalty recommendation, new funding for other initiatives and stiffer sentencing laws for drug dealers.
He said the United States must “get tough” on opioids. “And that toughness includes the death penalty,” he said. Neither Trump nor the White House gave further details as to when it would be appropriate to seek the death penalty.
Trump said that he was working with Congress to find $6 billion in new funding for 2018 and 2019 to fight the opioid crisis. The plan will also seek to cut opioid prescriptions by a third over three years by changing federal programs, he said.
Addiction to opioids - mainly prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl - is a growing U.S. problem, especially in rural areas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 42,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2016.
For Trump, the New Hampshire visit returned him to a state that gave him a key Republican primary election win when he was a political newcomer in 2016. Back then, he promised to tackle the opioid crisis, which is severe in the New England state.
In October, he declared the crisis a public health emergency, but without providing more money. Some critics, including Democratic lawmakers, said then that the declaration was meaningless without additional funds.
In Manchester, Trump stopped at a local fire station that helps addicts get treatment. He was greeted by roughly 200 protesters, some chanting “You talk, we die.”
Others carried signs, including one that read “Donald J. Duterte,” a reference to the Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal crackdown on drugs has lead to thousands of deaths.

Trump said he wanted to give first responders access to life-saving drugs that can reverse overdoses. He said the nasal spray Narcan, which can block opioid effects in overdoses, would be provided free to U.S. schools.
He introduced Mike Kelly, an executive at Adapt Pharma, which makes Narcan, at the event. “We've provided, free-of-charge, four boxes to all colleges and universities in the United States. Two boxes free for every high school in the United States, as well as educational awareness,” Kelly said.
Shares in Narcan seller Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Adapt's commercial partner, rose sharply after Trump's comments.
Trump also said his plan would crack down on international and domestic illicit drug supply chains. Part of that would include requiring electronic data for 90 percent of international mail shipments with goods, he said.

He said the United States would “engage with China and expand cooperation with Mexico to reduce supplies of heroin, other illicit opioids, and precursor chemicals.”
The Justice Department will target negligent physicians and pharmacies, he said, adding that he was considering litigation against drug companies implicated in the opioid crisis.
“We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. The death penalty is allowed in 31 states.
Dr Harold Pollack, an urban public health professor at the University of Chicago, said, “I don't think the death penalty for drug dealers will accomplish very much.”
He said there was little evidence that tougher sentencing reduced the availability of street drugs and urged Trump to work with Republican state governors to expand the Medicaid federal health program so that drug addicts could get more access to healthcare and counseling.
Ohio Democratic Representative Tim Ryan, in a statement, said Trump took too long to offer a plan, but praised him for offering “ambitious, evidence-based reforms.”
He added, “I am disappointed that President Trump felt the need to ... encourage prosecutors to seek the death penalty against drug dealers. I am all for punishing drug dealers, but I'm not for pushing the death penalty.”
Clayton Kershaw has struggled in the postseason during his career, and these moments were key in him getting that reputation. (1:32)
It seems almost blasphemous to criticize Clayton Kershaw's postseason performance. It's like criticizing Tom Hanks because he doesn't win the Oscar every year. Kershaw is the best pitcher of his generation, winner of three Cy Young Awards and five ERA titles. The career Los Angeles Dodgers starter is a remarkable 118-41 with a 2.08 ERA from 2011 to 2017. The left-hander's consistent execution and results defy the imagination.
But he's also 4-6 with a 4.28 ERA in 12 starts in the postseason from 2013 to 2016. He's had some good games, a few bad ones and some infamous seventh-inning meltdowns. He's certainly lacked a Madison Bumgarner moment or even a Corey Kluber-like run through the playoffs.
Some believe this tarnishes Kershaw's legacy. Some believe he hasn't actually pitched all that poorly and that the media is simply manufacturing an issue that doesn't exist.
Whatever your take, there's no denying that Kershaw's performance will again be one of the most fascinating subplots of the 2017 postseason. Before we find out what happens this year, let's look back at the six pitches that have defined Kershaw's postseason career so far.
1. 2013 NLCS, Game 6 versus Cardinals
The situation: Bottom of third, 0-0 tie, nobody on, one out
Pitch number: 55
The pitch: 2-2 slider to Matt Carpenter
Kershaw's first three 2013 postseason starts had gone well. He'd allowed four runs in 19 innings, pitched a 12-strikeout gem to beat the Braves in the NLDS, and lost Game 2 of the NLCS to Michael Wacha 1-0 on an unearned run.
Starting on five days of rest in Game 6, Kershaw had thrown 40 pitches through two innings, a high pitch count that perhaps indicated he wasn't at the top of his game. He retired Wacha to start the third before battling Carpenter in an epic 11-pitch confrontation.
Kershaw used his entire repertoire as Carpenter fouled off eight pitches -- including seven in a row -- before Carpenter finally hooked a double down the right-field line. It was a remarkable at-bat in many ways. When Kershaw got to two strikes, he struck the batter out nearly 50 percent of the time in 2013. Carpenter fouled off six pitches with two strikes.
From there, the inning fell apart, an excruciating 48-pitch debacle as the Cardinals scored four runs. Carpenter's double was the only extra-base hit, as the Cardinals put together four singles and two walks (one intentional). Carlos Beltran, Yadier Molina and David Freese all scorched their hits; the first two were rockets past diving infielders and the third went past Kershaw. Shane Robinson's two-run single to cap the scoring was the only hit not struck hard, a soft grounder into right field.
Some would label this bad luck. Has Kershaw simply been unlucky? After all, ground balls are good, although the Beltran and Molina hits weren't your typical five-hoppers through the infield. I compared Kershaw's regular-season numbers on grounders from 2013 through 2016 to his postseason results on grounders:
Regular season: .200 average allowed, .047 well-hit average
Postseason: .269 average allowed, .141 well-hit average
You can argue bad luck, but Kershaw has given up harder contact compared to the regular season. Harder contact means more hits.
One quote from Kershaw after the loss, which eliminated the Dodgers, stands out. He wasn't taking any consolation in a good season: "What does it really matter, making the playoffs or coming in last place, if you don't win the World Series? It doesn't really matter."
Could it be that come October, Kershaw puts so much pressure on himself that he's unable, as Annie Savoy of "Bull Durham" would recommend, to breathe through his eyelids when things get tight?
2. 2014 NL Division Series, Game 1 versus Cardinals
The situation: Top of seventh, Dodgers lead 6-4, bases loaded, two outs
Pitch number: 110
The pitch: 2-2 fastball to Matt Carpenter
When the Dodgers and Cardinals met again during the 2014 postseason, reports surfaced that the Cardinals might have stolen signs against Kershaw during that 2013 series.
“The Dodgers also planned to change their signs going into Friday's opener,” ESPN's Mark Saxon wrote before Game 1. “A year ago, many of the Dodgers believed the Cardinals had gotten wind of catcher A.J. Ellis' signs and were relaying the location of pitches to batters from second base.”
This game did nothing to alleviate rumors that the Cardinals had figured out something on Kershaw, whether because St. Louis was stealing signs or perhaps because Kershaw was tipping his pitches.
Kershaw led 6-2 entering the seventh, having allowed just two hits -- both home runs, including one to Carpenter. The first four batters singled. Matt Holliday hit a broken-bat liner to center, but the other three were all hit hard: Jhonny Peralta with a liner to left-center, Molina with a line drive to center and Matt Adams with a low screamer up the middle. No cheap ones. Jon Jay registered another hit sandwiched between two strikeouts, bringing up archnemesis Carpenter.
Kershaw got ahead on two foul balls. Carpenter then fouled off three more pitches. Kershaw's pitch count was getting up there -- 28 for the inning, 109 for the game. He was still throwing 95 mph, but the eighth pitch of the at-bat was down the middle, and Carpenter cleared the bases with a double off the right-center-field wall. Kershaw was done after 110 pitches. He had allowed six or fewer hits in 17 of his 27 starts during the regular season, but allowed six hits in this inning alone. Reliever Pedro Baez came in and give up a walk and home run to Holliday, and Kershaw was charged with eight runs in a 10-9 loss.
Carpenter said he was aware of the battle the year before.
“During that at-bat, I was thinking about it. It was kind of a very similar scenario,” Carpenter said after the game. "When I get in those at-bats versus him, I just try to fight. He's coming right after me; seems like every time I face him, I'm down 0-2 and I've got to fight my way back."
As much as everyone wanted to believe that Kershaw was tipping his pitches, fatigue was the more likely culprit. Game-time temperature was 92 degrees. No doubt the long inning wore on Kershaw. I'm reminded of something Justin Verlander said recently on ESPN's Pardon the Interruption about pitching in the playoffs being so mentally draining.
“You've pitched three innings, it feels like five,” he said. “You've pitched six innings and it feels like a complete game.”
Is that what happens to Kershaw? This isn't the only time we've seen him hit the wall in the seventh inning.
3.2014 NL Division Series, Game 4 versus Cardinals
The situation: Bottom of seventh, Dodgers lead 2-0, two on, no outs
Pitch number: 102
The pitch: 0-1 curveball to Matt Adams
This is the signature “What just happened?” moment of Kershaw's postseason career. In 2014, Adams hit just .190 against left-handed pitchers. A left-handed hitter, Adams was in the lineup because he'd had a couple of quality at-bats against Kershaw in previous postseason games.
Here's the stat that will blow you away: In the regular season from 2009 to 2017, Kershaw has allowed just 10 home runs off his curveball on more than 1,000 at-bats ending with the pitch ... and ZERO versus left-handed batters.
But in this NLDS game, Adams hit a home run -- the only one Kershaw has ever allowed to a lefty off his curveball. The Dodgers lost the game and the series. It didn't matter that neither of the two hits preceding the home run were hit hard. An iconic photo shows Adams watching the ball sail over the fence, both arms upraised with his index fingers pointing to the heavens. Kershaw is hunched over the mound, both hands on his knees, his head twisted back toward the outfield.
“The season ended and I was a big part of the reason why,” Kershaw would say. “It doesn't feel good, regardless of how you pitched. I can't really put it into words right now. Just bad déjà vu, all over again.”
4.2015 NL Division Series, Game 1 versus Mets
The situation: Top of seventh, Mets lead 1-0, runners at second and third, two outs
Pitch number: 113
The pitch: 3-2 fastball to Curtis Granderson
Kershaw was locked in a tense duel with Mets starter Jacob deGrom and took the mound for, you guessed it, the seventh inning. Kershaw had recorded 11 strikeouts and was sitting at 88 pitches. It was a late afternoon start in Los Angeles, with a game-time temperature once again of 92 degrees.
He walked Lucas Duda to lead off the inning. With one out, he got ahead 0-2 against light-hitting Ruben Tejada but eventually walked him on a 3-2 fastball way up. After deGrom bunted, Granderson was up. Kershaw chunked a 2-2 curveball in the dirt, slapping his hand on his thigh in frustration. Granderson fouled off a 95 mph fastball. The next fastball was outside for ball four -- the bases were loaded, and with the right-handed David Wright coming up, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly went to the bullpen.
It was the right call. Kershaw had walked three batters, which he'd done in a game just four times all season. Once again, he couldn't finish the seventh inning. Over the four regular seasons in question, Kershaw pitched seven-plus innings in 85 of 114 regular-season starts. In the playoffs, he has done it just three times in 12 starts (and has never pitched into the eighth inning).
Pedro Baez came on, Wright singled in two runs, and the Mets won 3-1. Kershaw came back in Game 4 on three days' rest and delivered one of his best playoff performances, winning 3-1, but the Mets won Game 5 and eliminated L.A.
5. 2016 NL Division Series, Game 4 versus Nationals
The situation: Top of seventh, Dodgers lead 5-2, runners at first and second, two outs
Pitch number: 110
The pitch: 3-2 fastball to Bryce Harper
Kershaw had won the series opener, scuffling through 101 pitches in five innings, allowing three runs. Now he was back on three days' rest. The Dodgers staked him to a three-run lead entering the top of the seventh.
Danny Espinosa led off with a hard single, but Kershaw got two quick outs. Then he had a little bad luck as Trea Turner hit a grounder to shortstop, but Corey Seager was shifted way over. Seager made a diving stop, but his flip to second base was a millisecond too late. That brought up Harper, suddenly the tying run. Give Harper credit here. He took a 1-2 fastball just low, somehow laid off a nasty 2-2 curve, fouled off two fastballs -- 95 and 94 mph -- and then took another fastball low and away for the walk.
Harper hadn't won the battle, but he didn't lose it, and he knocked Kershaw from the game. Maybe manager Dave Roberts should have left Kershaw in. You can debate that, along with the decision Mattingly made to pull Kershaw the year before. Dodgers relievers allowed all three baserunners to score. Kershaw ended up with a no-decision.
His ERA in the seventh inning over these four postseasons: 25.20. Over five innings pitched, he's allowed 12 hits, 14 runs and six walks. His ERA in innings 1-6 is 2.78.
Do we expect too much of Kershaw? Sure, we want the superhuman performances we see so often in the regular season. From 2013 to 2016, his average regular-season game score was 69; in the postseason, his average was 56. His best postseason game score of 78 (Game 2 last year against the Cubs) is tied for his 29th-best game in the regular season. Bumgarner, by contrast, has had five postseason game scores (spread out over four postseasons) better than Kershaw's best.
6.2016 NLCS, Game 6 versus Cubs
The situation: Bottom of fifth, Cubs lead 4-0, nobody on, two outs
Pitch number: 88
The pitch: 1-1 fastball to Anthony Rizzo
So here's the remarkable thing about Kershaw's performance in the postseason. His strikeout rate in 13 games (including one relief appearance) is 31.7 percent. In the regular season over the same years, it's 30.5 percent. The margin between dominance and mediocrity has been razor-thin. His failures in the postseason have come in bunches.
I noticed this too: After selecting the six key plate appearances, I realized all came against left-handed batters. Except for Adams, the others are extremely disciplined hitters, and they hyper-focused in these showdowns. Now, I could have chosen a different pitch in this game; it was already 4-0 when Rizzo homered. It even looked like a pretty good pitch, low and in. But check out where Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal set up: low and away. Missed location.
So here we go again. This is the best Dodgers team Kershaw has been part of. He doesn't have to do it all by himself. What will happen? Let's just say if he's out there in the seventh inning, I hope he's breathing through his eyelids.
Nova Scotia teachers will hold a one-day strike Friday in protest of the government's legislated contract.
READ MORE: Nova Scotia to impose parts of contract previously rejected by teachers
The Nova Scotia Teachers Union said in a release that “the complete lack of respect displayed by Stephen McNeil and his government towards teachers, students and the families” led to their decision.
“In the entire 122 year history of the NSTU, our members have never faced a more anti-education Premier than Stephen McNeil,” Doucet said.
“The legislation he introduced yesterday limits teachers' right to strike, erodes their ability to negotiate a fair contract and prevents them from advocating for reforms to improve learning conditions for their students. The result is the first province-wide teacher strike ever in Nova Scotia.”
The union says the strike aims to show MLAs the “full impact of the McNeil government's actions on Nova Scotia's public education system and public sector workers in the province.”

“We believe this legislation is unconstitutional and we owe it to our colleagues past, present and future to take this stand,” Doucet said.
“Stephen McNeil says he wants to hear from teachers, so on Friday teachers will spend the day ensuring the Premier and his Liberal caucus get the message – his government's bully tactics can no longer be tolerated.”
Iowa's top politicians are responding to this weekend's events in Virginia.
Iowa Republican Party chairman Jeff Kaufmann was the first to issue a statement Saturday via Twitter. Kaufmann said the “racism and bigotry on display in Charlottesville is stupid, shameful and destructive.”
Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley was next, saying what “white nationalists” were doing in Charlottesville was “homegrown terrorism.” Iowa Senator Joni Ernst also called it “terrorism” that was “fueled by racist hatred” that “has no place in our society.”
Governor Kim Reynolds said her prayers are with the victims and she condemed “ugly, vile, racist hate.”
By early this morning, all but one member of Iowa's congressional delegation had tweeted on the situation. Congressman Dave Loebsack, a Democrat from Iowa City, said on Saturday that the “vile hatred displayed by white supremacists in Charlotesville is unacceptable and unAmerican.” Congressman David Young, a Republican from Van Meter, tweeted on Sunday from Israel, where he's on a congressional trip. Young condemned the “hatred” on display in Charlottesville and tweeted a few Bible verses. Congressman Rod Blum, a Republican from Dubuque, posted a message on Facebook. Blum quoted Gandi and said there was no place in a “civil society” for “racist supremacy groups.” Republican Congressman Steve King of Kiron has not Tweeted since July 27th and has not issued a statement on Charlottesville.
The Iowa Democratic Party's chairman released a written statement Sunday, denounncing the “senseless acts by white supremacists and neo-nazis in Charlottesville.”
Here are the tweets, in the order they appeared on Twitter:
@kaufmanngop: The racism & bigotry on display in Charlottesville is stupid, shameful and destructive. These charlatans led by David Duke sicken me. @chuckgrassley: What ” WhiteNatjonalist” are doing in Charlottesville is homegrown terrorism that can't be tolerated anymore that what Any extremist does @joniernst: The violence in #Charlottesville that is fueled by racist hatred has no place in our society. (1/2)
@joniernst: We are one nation, under God, and indivisible. We cannot stand for this terrorism. (2/2) @IAgovernor: We must forcefully condemn ugly, vile, racist hate. My prayers are with the victims of these despicable acts #Charlottesville @daveloebsack: The vile hatred displayed by white supremacists in #Charlottesville is unacceptable & un-American. I mourn the loss of those who were killed @RepDavidYoung: It is just after 2:00 am here in Israel where I am wrapping up my travels and meetings and will begin my journey home to Iowa tomorrow
@RepDavidYoung: From a land that has seen the pain and deep divisions hatred has caused throughout history
@RepDavidYoung: I wanted to acknowledge and condemn the hate and pain we have seen this weekend at home.
@RepDavidYoung: Political discourse is something we can pride ourselves on in America – but hate is disgusting and must be condemned to the core
@RepDavidYoung: “Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister is still in the darkness.”
@RepDavidYoung: “Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble.”
@RepDavidYoung: “But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness.”
@RepDavidYoung: “They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them.” – 1 John 2:9-11 @RepRodBlum: My thoughts on Charlottesville: (from Facebook) This weekend's events in Charlottesville have saddened Karen, Sophie and me to our core. Violence is never the answer, and this terrorist act must be dealt with justly and swiftly. There is no place for a cowardly act like this or racist supremacy groups in civil society. Just two months ago my colleagues were playing baseball when a would-be assassin opened fire and nearly killed my good friend Congressman Steve Scalise over political differences, and now a young peaceful protestor has lost her life. This must end, we must come together as Americans first, and forget the labels we assign ourselves over politics. My prayers go out to Heather Heyer's family, Lt. H. Jay Cullen's family and Berke M.M. Bates's family – and everyone affected by this senseless tragedy. Thank God for our Law Enforcement who are there to protect and serve all of us.
You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty. – Gandhi
Kayley Olsson could easily tell you about her hardest day at work.
The hairdresser based in Waterloo, Iowa, recently made headlines after refusing to shave a depressed teenager's head. Instead, she spent two days cutting and styling it.
Posting the story on Facebook, Olsson said she met the 16-year-old teen with severe depression at her place of work on August 8.
“She got to the point where she felt so down and so worthless she couldn't even brush her hair, she told me she only got up to use the restroom. She starts back at school in a few weeks but she has her school pictures today,” she wrote on the social media site.
READ MORE: Instagram photos can indicate whether someone is depressed: study
“When she walked in she told us just cut it all off I can't deal with the pain of combing it out, she called herself worthless for it. It honestly broke my heart and we tried everything we could to keep this child's hair for her,” she continued.
The message
Olsson said she spent 13 hours over two days working on the teenager's matted hair. “We finally made this beautiful girl smile and feel like she IS worth something! Her last words to me was, ‘I will actually smile for my school picture today, you made me feel like me again.'”
In the post, which had over 195,000 likes and 75,000 shares, Olsson adds it's important for parents to realize what mental health can do to a child's day-to-day hygiene.
“MENTAL HEALTH is a thing, it affects people all around the world and of all ages! PARENTS take it seriously, don't just push your kids off and tell them to get over something they legitimately can't. A CHILD should NEVER feel so worthless to not even want to brush their hair.”

Social media responds to her kindness
On Facebook, thousands of readers celebrated Olsson, not only for sharing her story but also for raising awareness about depression in general.
“You made her feel cared for and respected, even though you were strangers. A simple act of kindness (and this one doesn't look like it was simple at all) can make all the difference between life and death,” user Jessi Piek wrote.
Some even shared their own personal stories with matted hair.
“My hair has gotten like this. I was in her shoes the end of 2016… I was severely depressed/stressed out. I wasn't taking care of myself. It physically hurt everything in me to lift my arms to brush my hair… I chopped both of them out with scissors and vowed to never do this to my hair again. My hair was uneven and ugly. Still have this side piece that hangs weird I have to pin up to hide it. But I'm doing a little better in life,” user Heather Pozek wrote.
“A year ago I went through a strong depression… however, a red lipstick helped me regain my self-esteem. Thanks for making the change on that girl. You gave me back faith in humanity,” Carmen Reyes wrote.
Mental health and hygiene
Kerrin Daniels, a counsellor based in Mississauga, Ont., says people with mental health disorders who don't pay attention to personal hygiene may feel a sense of disconnection to the world around them.
“The thoughts or opinions of others mean nothing and in fact, individuals stop caring about themselves,” she tells Global News. “Washing would be a sign that they care about themselves enough to honour themselves/their bodies by cleaning. Depressive symptoms effects work, [and] family life.”
If a mental health illness is affecting your day-to-day hygiene, it's time to reach out for help, adds Daniels. “So many people feel off, unhappy or not contented. The key is to make mental health a priority.”

Not being able to do things like brush your hair and teeth often stems from the difficulty of getting out of bed in the first place. If you are in this situation, Daniels suggests asking for time off. “For some this is difficult but it is necessary for healing. Depression doesn't go away without work.”
But she also recommends different mechanisms for managing depression.
Get a good amount of sleep, exercise and find support from others around you — whether that be a professional or a family member.
Where to get help
If you or someone you know is in crisis and needs help, resources are available. In the case of an emergency, please call 911 for immediate help.

In the wake of the mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip, UNLV students engaged in multiple fundraising efforts around the school's campus to try to raise money for the victims. Video by Campus Correspondent Dallas Kreil. (1:29)
The UNLV football team is rallying together in support of its local community after the mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip took the lives of 59 people and injured more than 500 last Sunday.
Rebels head coach Tony Sanchez told ESPN's Coley Harvey that his charge ahead of Saturday's home game versus San Diego State is for his players to realize they can be a unifying force for the city.
A pregame ceremony will be held at Sam Boyd Stadium, and the Rebels and Aztecs will have red ribbon decals affixed to their helmets. All visitors in attendance will also receive a wearable ribbon.
This weekend, ESPN will be providing coverage of UNLV's tribute to the victims of the tragedy.

Added Randall Cunningham on Las Vegas' resilience: "What this has done is drawn us closer together." He lives about four miles from Mandalay Bay hotel and all Sunday night heard the sirens of first responders rushing to the scene of the shooting. It was during a Wednesday prayer service when the emotions of the week hit the former NFL QB and current minister: "You mourn with those who mourn. I was literally crying out."

People living on the streets don't like to broadcast where they sleep, but Marty Henehan knows how to find them.
He doesn't want to deliver eviction orders. Instead, as nighttime temperatures fall below freezing, he's distributing cold-weather gear to help them stay alive.
The co-founder of the Forever Sammi Foundation, a Scranton-based organization working to end drug and alcohol addiction, is planning the group's second winter coat and blanket drive.
The foundation is collecting a number of items, including coats, hats and blankets, until Friday at three locations in Lackawanna County: Center City Print, Scranton; Commonwealth Financial Systems, Dickson City; and DePietro's Pharmacy, Dunmore.
After assembling packets, which will include a list of local social service and health providers as well as Henehan's own number, he'll go with a team of volunteers to tent communities and hideouts to deliver them.
Through his efforts to fight drug addiction, he talks regularly with people who live on the street or who were recently homeless and know where to look.
“A lot of the people that are in those situations are not really inclined to attend a clothing drive or go and ask for help,” said DePietro's Pharmacy owner Tom DePietro. “That's kind of why they're in the situation they're in.”
He applauded Henehan and the Forever Sammi group for delivering aid where its needed most.
“He's also willing to go under bridges and talk to people that are homeless — I mean, that's very special for our community to have somebody like him,” DePietro said.
Marty and Stacy Henehan's daughter Sammi Henehan died of an opioid drug overdose at age 23 in 2016. Since her death, the Scranton couple has worked aggressively to help people struggling with addiction, a mission that often puts them in touch with the homeless.
Sammi and Stacy Henehan wanted to put together simple Christmas care packages for the homeless.
“It was something that Stacy had said she and Sammi were going to do,” Henehan said. “And we believe that we do it with Sammi.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - High-ranking officials of the United States and North Korea met in New York late on Wednesday in the first of two days of talks about the future of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program and a possible summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol, a close aide of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, met for about 90 minutes over dinner and exited without providing any detailed remarks to reporters waiting outside.
Pompeo would only say that the dinner “was great” and that the two men dined on “American beef.”
It was not yet known whether the two men made any progress toward narrowing long-standing differences between Washington and Pyongyang that could end decades of hostile relations.
Earlier in the day, the White House left open the possibility of a Trump-Kim summit on June 12 in Singapore, despite Trump's cancellation of the meeting just days ago.
As the dinner was underway inside an apartment on New York's East Side, just south of the United Nations, a senior State Department official separately briefed reporters on the high-level talks that were underway.
Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol, vice chairman of the ruling Workers' Party's Central Committee, “are trying to get to know each other” following their two initial meetings this year in North Korea, said the U.S. official who asked not to be identified.
The official added that before any summit between the two leaders can occur, Pyongyang is “going to have to make clear what they are willing to do” amid demands from Washington that North Korea permanently end its nuclear weapons program.
Trump, the official said, “can make a fly or no-fly decision anytime he wants,” referring to the possible unprecedented Singapore summit.
If not enough progress is made to lead to a productive meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un, the official said, “We will ramp up the pressure on them and we'll be ready for the day that hopefully they are ready.”
Shortly before Wednesday's dinner, Pompeo repeated the Trump administration's bottom-line demand:
“Looking forward to meeting with Kim Yong Chol in New York to discuss @Potus potential summit with Chairman Kim. We are committed to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula @StateDept,” Pompeo said in a Twitter post.
Trump last week called off the summit after North Korea expressed anger at comments by senior U.S. officials. But Trump later said he was reconsidering his position and U.S., North Korean and South Korean officials have gone ahead with summit preparations.

The White House said on Wednesday that negotiations at the demilitarized zone along the border between North and South Korea for the summit were going well.
Separately on Wednesday at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Admiral Harry Harris, the outgoing head of U.S. Pacific Command who is Trump's pick to be the ambassador to South Korea, said North Korea remained the United States' most imminent threat. “And a nuclear-capable North Korea with missiles that can reach the United States is unacceptable,” Harris said.
Earlier, a U.S. official said negotiations about the summit's agenda have so far been slow going, and the two fundamental issues, the definition of North Korean denuclearization and whether both sides would take actions at the same time or separately, remained unsettled.
‘DENUCLEARIZATION'
Trump has sworn not to allow North Korea to develop nuclear missiles that could hit the United States and wants North Korea to “denuclearize,” or get rid of its nuclear arms.
But the leadership in Pyongyang is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival and has rejected unilaterally disarming.
The Trump administration, according to U.S. officials, has left open the possibility of North Korea eventually getting U.S. aid and investments if Pyongyang agrees to complete denuclearization.
North Korea's position going into the meetings with Pompeo was that a pledge of denuclearization alone should open the way to economic relief, said the official who briefed reporters earlier on Wednesday and spoke on condition of anonymity.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted Seoul's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon as saying in a speech on Wednesday that the differences between North Korea and the United States on the denuclearization issue remained “quite significant” and it would not be easy to narrow the gap.
However, Cho added that the engagement of the leaders of the two countries meant “chances are high that common ground can be found.”
Kim Yong Chol is the most senior North Korean official to meet top officials for talks in the United States since Jo Myong Rok, a vice marshal, met then-President Bill Clinton at the White House in 2000.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's top court ruled on Wednesday that a British lesbian should be granted a spousal visa in a landmark judgment that could open the door for expatriate same-sex partners to move to the Chinese-ruled city.

The British woman, who requested to be identified only as QT in court, sued the director of immigration in 2014 after she was denied a spousal visa that would have granted her resident status and allowed her to work without the need for a separate visa.
The woman and her partner, a dual British and South African national identified only as SS and who was offered work in Hong Kong, had entered into a civil partnership in Britain. QT did not appear in court.
“Although I cannot be with you in person today, that does not diminish the joy I feel, knowing that Hong Kong's highest court has upheld my right, as a lesbian woman, to be treated equally by the Hong Kong government,” QT said in a statement.
The unanimous ruling by five judges, upholding a lower court's decision, brings to an end the case involving rights for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, which won support from more than 30 global banks and law firms, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
“This ruling strengthens Hong Kong's ability to attract
global talent and its competitiveness as Asia's pre-eminent global centre for commerce,” the companies said in a statement.
The decision effectively recognises the rights of same-sex couples who legally entered civil partnerships abroad, said the British woman's lawyer, Michael Vidler.
“This does, and will, and can apply to a greater sphere,” he said outside the Court of Final Appeal. “We never argued this case is about same-sex marriage for Hong Kong, but we hope this case will pave the way for exactly that.”
ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS
Hong Kong is a popular destination for expatriates, many of whom work in the city's financial services and legal sectors.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in Hong Kong 1991, although marriage is legally defined as a monogamous union between a man and a woman. It does not recognise same-sex marriage.
There is no law against sexual discrimination in the territory which is governed under a “one country, two systems” formula that promises it a high degree of autonomy, a legal system separate from that of mainland China and an independent judiciary.
The Department of Immigration said it respected the court's decision.
“We are studying the judgment carefully and shall seek legal advice as necessary before deciding the way forward,” it said.
In a 45-page judgment, the judges said the director of immigration's assertion that an obvious difference existed between marriage and a civil partnership rested on “shaky foundations”.
The court also said that while the director of immigration's policy aimed to attract foreign talent, the act of rejecting same-sex partners was counter-productive.
“As is evident from the attempted intervention of the banks and law firms, the ability to bring in dependants is an important issue for persons deciding whether to move to Hong Kong,” it said.
Veteran LGBT activist Billy Leung, who arrived at court with a small rainbow flag, said he knew at least six same-sex couples who had chosen not to move to Hong Kong or had left the city in the past five years over what they described as a lack of LGBT-friendly policies.
“The struggle is real,” he said.

Hawthorn have signed two-time premiership ruckman Ben McEvoy to a new AFL deal.
Hawthorn have signed two-time premiership ruckman Ben McEvoy to a new two-year AFL contract.
McEvoy has enjoyed career-best form in a tough campaign for the Hawks, who are 12th with nine wins and a draw, with two rounds left in the home-and-away season.
The 28-year-old has averaged 32.5 hitouts and kicked 13 goals - both career-high marks - in 20 games this season.
The new deal ties him to the club until the end of the 2019 season.
"Ben plays an important role for the side and we're really pleased that he'll remain in the brown and gold for a further two years," list manager Graham Wright said.
"He's had to shoulder the majority of the ruck work this season, which he has done in emphatic fashion, and he provides a strong marking target when resting up forward.
"As a seasoned campaigner, Ben offers great leadership to the young guys coming through the ranks, so he's a really important figure to have around the club."
McEvoy has played 75 games Hawthorn after his switch from St Kilda - where he made 91 senior appearances - at the end of the 2013 season.
He featured in the club's premiership teams in 2014 and 2015.
The Hawks also signed young gun Blake Hardwick to a two-year contract extension on Monday.
The round 15 rising star nominees is now tied to the club until the end of the 2019 season.
Michigan has started four different quarterbacks during Jim Harbaugh's three seasons in Ann Arbor with varying levels of success. The only constant at Harbaugh's native position during that time has been quarterback competitions. And he just upped the ante in that department in a big way.
Former Ole Miss quarterback Shea Patterson declared Monday via Twitter that he intends to join the Wolverines for what remains of his college football career. Patterson was considered the top pro-style prospect in the nation two years ago when he joined the Rebels. If the NCAA grants him permission to play next fall at Michigan, he will immediately jump into the top tier of quarterback talent in the Big Ten, along with the likes of Trace McSorley at Penn State and Ohio State's heir apparent, Dwayne Haskins.
That won't, however, guarantee Patterson a starting job with Michigan. His decision doesn't immediately answer the biggest question facing Michigan this offseason.

Patterson will join rising redshirt sophomore Brandon Peters and redshirt freshman Dylan McCaffrey, among others, this offseason in the quarterback room -- competing at a position that troubled Michigan as much as any other during an 8-4 regular season this past fall. When he's inevitably asked who will lead the charge into spring practice, Harbaugh will almost certainly answer with some version of the response he has given every offseason since he returned to his childhood hometown.
"It will be a meritocracy at its best," Harbaugh said in 2015. The next year he added, "Roll the balls out there and let them play."
Harbaugh, throughout his coaching career, has been a fervent worshipper at the altar of competition. Pursuing Patterson and adding him to the current group of touted, yet largely unproven quarterbacks means that the coach is doubling down on one of his core principles in hopes of solving what has been maybe his team's most vexing issue in the last couple years.
Doubling down, of course, usually comes with the caveat that the next card you get had better be a good one. Michigan will once again have a championship-level defense in 2018. It will return most of its starters on offense. It remains a playmaking quarterback away from competing for championships. If Patterson isn't the guy to push Michigan over the considerable hump of winning at least a division title (or the guy who pushes Peters to do the same), the mountain of nitpicking that will come from Michigan's sizable fan base will make even Harbaugh's final year with the San Francisco 49ers seem like a friendly work environment.
The Wolverines could have stuck with Peters as their sure starter heading into this offseason -- although the outgoing transfers of former starter Wilton Speight and veteran reserve Alex Malzone create good reason to search for additional depth at the position. Peters showed promise in his four games leading the offense this November. He was trending upward when a head injury knocked him out of close game against then-undefeated Wisconsin.
Harbaugh's chief critique of the 6-foot-5, strong-armed Peters was that he was a bit too quiet to command authority under center. An offseason as the big man on campus could have aided his growing confidence and positioned him as an anchor on Michigan's burgeoning, talented roster. There are plenty of coaches who support the school of thought that having a solid and certain quarterback in place helps a team find its identity during a critical offseason.
That has never been Harbaugh's approach, and it's no surprise he's sticking to his guns this time around. Patterson threw for 2,259 yards and 17 touchdowns in seven games before injuring his leg this season at Ole Miss. Many believe the 2018 season -- as long as he's eligible to play -- will be a one-year pit stop en route to a bright NFL future for Patterson.
He could be an ideal one-and-done answer as the Michigan coaching staff continues to try to develop talents like Peters and McCaffrey. But Patterson isn't being presented as an anointed stopgap savior within Michigan's walls. This guy wants your job, Harbaugh will tell his quarterbacks, would any of you care to fight him for it?
Michigan needs an answer at quarterback in 2018. Patterson's decision to come to Ann Arbor isn't a definite answer, but it's a step toward one. It's a sign that Harbaugh is betting big on the one fundamental belief that has led to a lot of success in his football life: The better the competition, the better the results. And the competition just got a lot more talented at Michigan.
Rory McIlroy celebrates after sinking a birdie putt on the 18th green to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill Club & Lodge in Orlando on Sunday. Stephen M. Dowell  Orlando Sentinel via AP
AUSTIN, Texas >> Rory McIlroy had his first Arnold Palmer moment before the tournament even started.
He had just finished his pro-am round at Bay Hill and was about to walk out of the tunnel leading from the 18th green when a man asked him for a picture. McIlroy obliged, because he usually does. But this was different.
The man handed him a black bolero hat and told McIlroy it was from his squadron when he served in Vietnam. He didnt want a selfie with McIlroy. He wanted a picture of McIlroy wearing the hat that meant so much to him. The hat looked awkward on him with golfing attire, but McIlroy didnt mind.
Its all about giving the fans what they want.

Then the 28-year-old from Northern Ireland gave them something even better with what McIlroy described as a perfect round of golf, certainly the closing stretch. He birdied five of the last six holes, capping it off with a 25-foot putt on the 18th hole to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
That ended his longest drought without a victory in eight years, and it cast him in a new light with the Masters approaching.
McIlroy had fallen to No. 13 in the world when he missed the cut the previous week at the Valspar Championship, his second missed cut in four PGA Tour events this year. He had not been that low in the ranking since April 25, 2010.
Its not that he was forgotten; rather, attention was shifting to so many others that it was easy to feel overlooked. All it took was one victory for the conversation to include his bid for a green jacket to complete the career Grand Slam.
Its huge for my confidence going into the next few weeks, McIlroy said. I kept saying I didnt need a win going into Augusta to feel like I had a chance. I just wanted to see signs of good golf. And thankfully, Ive been able to get both.
Just dont get the idea his confidence was lagging.
McIlroy always says that when hes playing well, its hard to remember ever playing poorly. And when hes playing poorly, its hard to remember what it was like to play well. But he has a history of going through spurts of mediocrity, and coming out of it strong without notice. Most memorable was in 2012 when he missed the cut four times in five tournaments. Two months later, he won the PGA Championship and consecutive FedEx Cup playoff events.
Three times in his career, McIlroy has won in his next start after missing the cut. Five other times, he won after finishing out of the top 30.
Thats why he wasnt the least bit concerned after missing the cut at the Valspar Championship.
Its such a fine line out here, and I might have sounded crazy the last few weeks when I was telling everyone it actually feels pretty close and Im not that far away, and Im putting up 72s and 73s, he said. And all of a sudden, it all clicks into place and I end up winning a golf tournament by three shots and shooting 8 under on the last day. So its fine lines out here. I think you have to play the game to really appreciate that. Its not as black and white as some people make it out to be.
He could think of only one time he was genuinely worried about his game.
McIlroy was 19 and in his first full year as a pro in 2008. He had only two top 10s all year on the European Tour. He wasnt eligible for any of the majors. He had missed three straight cuts in Sweden, Holland and Scotland. He was concerned he might lose his card. And then he lost in a playoff in Switzerland, lost in another playoff in Hong Kong and won his first pro event early in the next year.
And I was off and running, he said.
McIlroy reached No. 50 with that playoff loss in Hong Kong, and he hasnt fallen out since then. Hes had a few dips, sure, but its not as if Ive had to panic.
Palmer and McIlroy share one other connection, at least for now. They are one leg short of the Grand Slam. Palmer never won the PGA Championship. McIlroy needs the Masters. When they had dinner at Bay Hill in 2015  right before McIlroys first crack at the fourth leg of the slam  the topic never came up.
Its amazing to think, all that Arnold did in the game, he never won that Grand Slam, McIlroy said.
McIlroy at the Masters, Phil Mickelson at the U.S. Open and Jordan Spieth at the PGA Championship each have a chance at the career slam this year.
Im glad to be part of that conversation, get the first shot at it in a few weeks, McIlroy said. So well see how we go.
His game is never far away, even if it doesnt look like it at times.
Holding its 4th annual show on Saturday 2nd December, after being postponed from October 1st due to the devastation of Hurricane Maria, the UK-based youth-focused organisation, the Waitukubuli Culture and Tourism Initiative (WCTI) once again celebrated Dominica's culture and heritage in a parade of Creole fashion and cultural engagement. The outgoing Miss Wob Alisha Laurent-Smart opened the event leading the way to an evening of fun and splendour.
The organisation and its signature event were launched in 2014 by Dr Violet Cuffy in an effort to address a major void in the UK for greater youth involvement with their Dominican history, heritage and culture.
Victorious on the night were: Ti Matador Lara Joseph (Centre) Miss Wob Dwiyet Rianna Patterson (left) and La Dame Creole Eshiva Wright (right). The crowd was also captivated by guest appearances from the winners of other UK pageant Mr & Miss West Indies UK; storyteller, Jane Grell and Slyvia Mitchell with a paleꞌ creole session among others.
The team at WCTI stand in solidarity with the government and people of Dominica in this time of difficulty and in so doing made a concerted effort this year to reach out international friends in promoting the culture of the Nature Isle. The members wish to send sympathies to all who have suffered loss of life, particularly to the staff of the Dominica Cultural Division and Dominica Broadcasting Radio Station at the sudden passing of Jacinta David and Kurt Matthew whose work directly and indirectly respectively have had an impact on Dominica's heritage and culture.
Next year's event is scheduled to be held on October 6th 2018. We encourage young person and parents to be part of this initiative and wish to appeal to you to email: info@wcti.org.uk for more information or contact Dr Cuffy at 07932730391.
Firefighters are continuing to pour water on hot spots at a racquet club blaze in midtown Toronto that forced the evacuation of surrounding buildings on Tuesday.
Residents living at condominiums near the fire remain displaced and storefronts are still closed. A reception area for those affected by the fire is still operating at 55 St. Clair Avenue West with the Red Cross onsite to help.

At the height of the fire on Tuesday, more than 100 fire crews were dispatched to the scene at Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue East to contain the massive blaze which destroyed The Badminton & Racquet Club of Toronto.
The inferno, which began just after 9 a.m., was eventually classified as a six-alarm with around 40 fire trucks on scene. No injuries were reported as a result of the fire.
Excavation equipment was called on Tuesday evening to help firefighters demolish the building and get at the hot spots.
Public transit and road closures
Public transit and road closures were in effect for the area on Tuesday but many of the services and roads reopened on Wednesday.
Yonge Street is now open north of St. Clair Avenue in both directions and westbound St. Clair Ave West is open to traffic between Avenue Road and Avoca Avenue.
St. Clair West subway station, which was closed for the better part of Tuesday, is back in service. However, the fire operation is still diverting the 97 Yonge buses.

Fire Chief Matthew Pegg said Tuesday the evacuation orders remain in effect until the area is deemed safe.
Mayor John Tory said late last night that people displaced by the fire should prepare for an extended evacuation.
An email sent from racquet club management to its members Tuesday said it appeared the fire originated in the main lounge located in the south-east corner of the complex.
According to the club's website, it was founded in 1924 and recently underwent extensive renovations. It is touted as “a preeminent Canadian private racquet, fitness, wellness and social club.”
VIDEO: Residents should plan ahead in case work continues late into Wednesday
A rush of money began showing up on the Clemson Tigers late last week at Las Vegas sportsbooks and hasn't slowed down yet.
In fact, out of the first $11,020 bet at the Westgate SuperBook on the money-line for the College Football Playoff National Championship between Clemson and Alabama, $11,000 of it was on the underdog Tigers.
"Twenty bucks on Alabama," Ed Salmons, SuperBook assistant manager, said Sunday night.
Alabama is around a -240 favorite to win straight up, with the Tigers listed as 2-1 underdogs to pull the upset in the Jan. 9 title game (8 p.m. ET, ESPN) at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.
The Crimson Tide is 6.5-point favorites, down slightly from the consensus opening line of Alabama -7 and significantly less than what some sportsbooks had projected the point spread would be before Saturday's semifinal games. The South Point sportsbook was offering Alabama -11 against Clemson before this weekend's action.
The Tigers drubbed the Ohio State Buckeyes 31-0, and crushed sportsbooks in the process. So much money poured in on Clemson in the hours leading up to its semifinal showdown with Ohio State that the Tigers went from 2.5-point underdogs to 1-point favorites at the SuperBook.
"We got crushed, just crushed," Salmons said. "Every bet we wrote yesterday was Alabama and Clemson. Every bet, every parlay ... Alabama and Clemson."
"It was a bloodbath," MGM vice president of race and sports Jay Rood added. "No good."
Alabama advanced to its second straight championship game with a 24-7 win against the Washington Huskies on Saturday in the other College Football Playoff semifinal at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl.
The Huskies were as much as 17-point underdogs in the weeks leading up to the Peach Bowl and drew heavy support from sophisticated bettors, driving the line down to Alabama -13.5 by kickoff. On Thursday, the MGM had taken twice as much money on Washington as it had taken on the Crimson Tide.
But the betting public that showed up en masse during the New Year's weekend in Las Vegas sided with the Crimson Tide, overwhelming the money that the books accepted from professional players and handing the house a loss.
"We ended up with twice as much money written to Bama as we did Washington," Rood said.
The two semifinals generated massive betting interest. Well over $1 million was bet on each game at just MGM's sportsbooks. At William Hill's Nevada sportsbook, Clemson-Ohio State and Washington-Alabama each attracted more than three times as much money as was bet on the Michigan-Ohio State game from November.
"We took many, many six-figure bets on both games and each of the teams," Johnny Avello, executive director of the Wynn race and sportsbook, said Sunday.
Bowl betting odds and ends
-- After jumping out to a 24-0 halftime lead, Arkansas was listed as a -1,400 favorite to beat Virginia Tech in the Belk Bowl at William Hill. At one point during the game, with the Razorbacks leading comfortably, a bettor put $1,100 on Arkansas at -1,100 odds in an attempt to net $100. Virginia Tech stormed back and won 35-24, much to the delight of a bettor, who took a $490 stab on the Hokies during the game at +850 odds. The bet netted $4,165.
--Through Saturday's games, bowl underdogs were 24-12 against the spread.
LONDON — Frieze Art fever has swept through London with gallerists undaunted by showing in a country that's heading out of the European Union, while fashion brands, designers and retailers such as Etro, Christopher Kane, Bally and Moda Operandi took full advantage of the buzzy moment in the British capital.
Under the Frieze tents in Regent's Park, international gallery owners said it's important to be present at the fair, which began on Thursday and runs through Sunday. Gallerists said they see the event as an important sales generator and a window to an international clientele.
Astrid Hamm, senior director of the Berlin-based gallery Eigen + Art, said Frieze is one of the few fairs in which the gallery chooses to take part, as it provides a strong platform to build young artists' reputations and generate sales.
“We've been here since the beginning, when it was literally freezing because they hadn't figured out the heating system yet. It's an international crowd, with French buyers coming for the weekend as well as international ones. We had a strong start on Thursday, meeting key Chinese and Indian collectors,” said Hamm.
This year the gallery chose to showcase the work of young British artists Tom Anholt and Ross Chisholm, alongside photography by the likes of Rikene Dikstra, whose raw portraits of young women stood out in the space.
Alissa Friedman, director of the New York-based gallery Salon 94, said her Frieze experience had been good so far. “I'm feeling positive about sales. I think this is our 11th year, and for us it's a very visible venue for the U.K. and Europe. We've built up a good collector base.”
She said it's a way to bring people together, “and to focus on things that are not the natural disasters and political crises that are happening. It's clearly a place of commerce, but more and more people also treat their art fairs like exhibitions.”
Artists including Marina Adams and Betty Woodman were on show in the space, which resembled a small exhibition.
Although galleries declined to disclose sales figures, a representative at Frieze said the fair was off to a strong start with significant sales already taking place before the official opening.
During the VIP opening on Wednesday, the New York-based gallery Jack Shainman — a new Frieze London participant — sold a new work by Kerry James Marshall to a U.S. private collector for $875,000, while the Korean artist Lee Bull sold three works, all valued above $100,000.
Among the highest-valued items on display is a piece by Jean-Michel Basquiat valued at $8 million.
The energy was already flowing around London on the eve of the fair, with myriad art-related events taking place around town.
On Tuesday night, Natasha Fraser-Cavassoni was signing copies — 150 of them to be exact — of her new book “After Andy: Adventures in Warhol Land” at Loulou's in Mayfair.
Guests included members of the author's literary clan — her mother Lady Antonia Fraser and sister Rebecca Fraser, whose next book “The Mayflower Generation” will be released later this month. Jean Pigozzi, who is making a documentary based on Fraser-Cavassoni's 2004 book “The Life and Times of Sam Spiegel,” was another guest in the basement club.
Moda Operandi's cofounder Lauren Santo Domingo kept the art party going with an afternoon tea held at the retailer's private shopping space in Belgravia to launch the second iteration of the homeware collaboration between Moda and Cabana, the interior design publication by Martina Mondadori.
The collection has an oriental flavor, inspired by Moroccan motifs. It puts the focus on rich jewel tones, from saffron to Egyptian red.
Bally and Etro used Frieze London as a platform to showcase collaborations with creatives outside the fashion realm.
Music producer Kasseem Dean, better known as Swizz Beatz, teamed with Bally to spread the love — of art. Swizz, who has been promoting emerging artists through his platform “No Commission,” which puts sales proceeds straight into artists' pockets, tapped the Spanish artist Ricardo Cavolo for a 27-piece men's and women's accessories and ready-to-wear capsule range that features the artist's bold graphic prints and features shaman motifs.
“Here's a young artist out of Spain showing his work in the windows of Bond Street in London,” said Swizz.
Jacopo Etro, a self-confessed fan of the fair and the British capital, continued the tradition of collaborating with artists as part of Frieze. This year, he joined forces with the Welsh artist Dan Rees for an in-store exhibition and a limited-edition scarf featuring patterns created by Rees.
“London is probably one of the most creative worldwide cities, you can go to any part of the city and discover different kinds of artists. It's also the place that probably draws so many people coming from all over the world, and particularly from all over Europe. Let's hope that's going to last; Europeans are very scared,” said Etro.
He said he gave carte blanche to Rees and was intrigued by the resulting artworks, which explored the idea of propaganda, and were displayed at an intimate corner at Etro's Bond Street flagship.
Christopher Kane hosted an in-store exhibition of his own honoring the late Romanian outsider artist Ionel Talpazan, who is best known for his UFO-inspired art and for having claimed that he had UFO encounters from the age of eight.
“I've always been a fan of Ionel, ever since college. For me his sketches are just brilliant, they have a real story to tell, there's a background, no nonsense, they come from a world not affected by fashion and the art world. It's just raw emotion. It's really emotive, spellbound,” said Kane.
To mark the launch of his fall 2017 see-now-buy-now accessories capsule, Kane translated some of Talpazan's UFO sketches into printed midi dresses on the catwalk.
“It's always about being respectful, to the artists whether living or dead. I wanted to show my respect and I wanted the clothes to feel wearable and real,” he added.
Two men have been arrested in connection with the homicide of a 42-year-old man from Dartmouth in January.
Halifax Regional Police (HRP) say a 30-year-old man and a 52-year-old man were arrested at 10 a.m. on Monday.
The two remain in police custody and HRP say that charges are anticipated in the death of Derek Miles.

According to police, their officers arrived an apartment building at 89 Pinecrest Dr. at around 4:25 p.m., on Jan. 19 in response to a report of a man in medical distress. The man was pronounced deceased at the scene.
On Jan. 20, the Medical Examiner ruled the death a homicide and identified the victim as Miles.
“Derek was a great family friend and this should never have happened,” Robert Noseworthy, a neighbour, told Global News in January. “He had a warm personality. Derek was an A1 guy.”
Miles' death was the city's first homicide of 2018.

MGMT never had a chance to sell out because they arrived already bought-in. Instead, after finding success on their debut album, the band adhered to the opposite trope, burying their heads further into the sand in their pursuit of music so outwardly antagonistic as to dare listeners to continue riding the hype train. Pulling a Pearl Jam, you could call it.
Even more so than Pearl Jam, Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden succeeded in their quest for semi-obscurity. At this time last year hardly anyone expected Columbia's most uncouth signees to make music that would get stuck in our heads anymore — or even to make music people would remember at all.
That frank assessment is perhaps unfair to two music nerds who simply wanted to follow their inspiration in the moment rather than the one they'd mined back in college. But the extent to which MGMT struck universal adoration during their first go round is difficult to overstate. The band's debut Oracular Spectacular produced three massive singles that earned the group both fervent popularity and critical admiration. If Spotify had as strong of a hold over the way we consumed music in 2007 as it does at present, “Kids,” “Time To Pretend,” and “Electric Feel” would have been in everyone's Discovery Weekly playlist, regardless of if they listened only to top 40 or needling drone rock.
The band's style of fluid, yelpy, hazily groovy indie pop soon came to dominate the world, taking over festival lineups from the bottom up and eventually becoming the new sound of alternative rock radio. Those songs birthed the likes of Foster The People and Empire Of The Sun, but the deeper cuts on the album, featuring the more potent strains of ‘60s-stylized tunes, also opened doors for the likes of Foxygen and other retro wave-riders. MGMT never had just one trick, a fact that got lost on the fans they accidentally courted with the oldest songs in their repertoire, the ones they wrote before they knew their music would ever be heard outside Wesleyan's dorm room walls.
Yet even at Oracular's loosest, MGMT were ultimately making pop music for people who thought they liked psychedelic rock. Which is why when they took an even more freewheeling, shaggy approach and began making actual psychedelic music, the masses dispersed, leaving behind a comparatively tiny hardcore fan base. This was mostly intentional, with Goldwasser and VanWyngarden spending their next two albums trying to distance themselves from a sudden and uncomfortable fame by suggesting they didn't actually deserve it at all. In order to ensure the mainstream would not once again follow their tracks, MGMT began to wear aimlessness as a mission statement.
That reach towards something the duo considered more artistically honest left us instead with Congratulations and MGMT. The former is a mostly charming space-rock album you'd appreciate more if it had come from a different band (in fact, among music critics and Stereogum commenters at least, the notion that Congratulations is Actually Good has become so widespread that it practically qualifies as conventional wisdom). The latter is tough to stomach even if you respect MGMT's insular ambitions.
At their best moments, which proved the two songwriters held considerable skill in crafting unique sounds and converging disparate genres, both albums still felt as though they were coming from a place of retaliation, rather than revelation. It was unclear if this music was what they actually wanted to write or what they knew people who bought tickets to their live show solely for “Kids” didn't want to hear.
But you can't run from surprise hits because they'll ultimately outlast you. MGMT's crucial misstep in trying to erase their first impression was in failing to present something equally memorable for us to hold onto in its stead. What makes Little Dark Age, the band's fourth studio album released last month, a return to form isn't that it is poppier and glossier, resembling more closely the hits that first introduced us to the band. It's that the music feels purposeful where the songs on Congratulations and especially the self-titled album often felt willfully obtuse. It's the duo's first release since the start of their career that doesn't seem to be single-mindedly fixated on subverting our expectations. Yet it's also a genuine surprise that savors its pleasures in novel pockets of musicality unlike both the ones we'd hoped for or those we begrudgingly came to expect.
Little Dark Age is a wild record — as odd and reaching as the band's other full-lengths — but it's weird in different ways. Across its 10 tracks are dreamy Euro-pop like “Me And Michael,” electro goth-prog like the title track, and tropical lounge instrumentals like “Days That Got Away.” All of those songs are equally delicious as they are delirious, and they present entire new dimensions of a band that's long been reduced to two polar extremes of simple electro-pop and messy noise-rock. Taken as a whole, the album is both the most consistent thing they've ever done and the one that least resembles any other in their catalogue.
What made Oracular's the most outlandish moments succeed where the second and third records faltered was a sense of space. Oft-kilter new age like “The Youth” or ‘70s revival pastiche like “Of Moons, Birds & Monsters” are idiosyncratic, but also committed to exploring in-depth one idea at a time. Even the folksier, headier parts of MGMT's debut (think “4th Dimensional Transition” or “Future Reflections”) were in service of actual songs — featuring melodies with conviction and sturdy foundations. The band's fleeting focus works well for accents, not the fundamentals. The music on Little Dark Age understands this. It never lets the flourishes, which are both considerable and immaculate, overpower the song's structural integrity. The most impressive departure the album takes from its predecessors is that each track stands alone as succinct and fully-realized.
Because of their fixation on upending perceptions, MGMT now sit as a band with a mythology, but not a legacy — the prophesied breakout stars of a distinct moment they left behind for artists actually interested in writing more “Electric Feel”s. But now they are back to penning tunes that could stand in for those longed-for sequels to their early irreverently earwormy hits, doing so for what is their best album yet. Will it be enough to reclaim the career momentum they abandoned along the way?
The answer was immediately clear during the band's show at the Anthem in Washington, DC this past Thursday night. The set opened with a lone silhouette noodling on a cheap sounding keyboard as hazy blue lighting crept around the stage. Then with the drop of a burbling bass, the rest of the band came in and steadily transformed the discordant combination of low-end and tinny piano into the title track of Little Dark Age. Some of the crowd hesitantly began to shuffle, but you could palpably feel the lack of movement for a song with an infectious, if elegiac groove. The general reception treated the tune, and the subsequent, equally excellent “When You Die,” as perfunctory new songs serving as placeholders until the chance to relive some beloved decade-old jams.
This reaction was to no fault of the band. A deft five-piece, they performed with a well-practiced professionalism that assuaged my fears from years of horror stories shared by friends who'd caught them at their most apathetic. The night's ensemble was both durable and elastic, stretching out the music to loosely threaded jams without the compositions ever breaking or thinning out. “Hand It Over” moved with an enthralling, slippery down-tempo strut. Meanwhile the delightful synthpop gem “James” unraveled with an energy as irreverent as it was resonant, coming across like Tame Impala covering Weezer. While the visuals at times leaned lazily on grab-bag “trippy” imagery and uninspired gross-out gags, the band played successfully with stage antics like riding an exercise bike during Little Dark Age's buoyant opening track “She Works Out Too Much” or projecting an ominous wallpaper of familiar apps during “TSLAMP,” much to the delight of audience members ironically pulling out their phones to snap a photo.
These virtues were received tepidly at best. Worse still were the two moments where the band pulled from their current mid-period. “Alien Days” basically halted the show's momentum. Although arguably the most holistic “song” on their self-titled album, it's still a total slog almost entirely comprising atonal mid-tempo schlock that, especially in the live setting, never seemed to stumble into something resembling a chord progression. That track deserved to fizzle out upon arrival. The humble but sumptuous acoustic pop ditty “Congratulations,” however, did not warrant such a dismal fate. Yet like the rest of the the numbers they played between “Electric Feel” and main set closer “Kids,” it never stood a chance of connecting.
Look, I'm not saying that the band's early-era trio of trump cards shouldn't have received the greatest level of excitement from the audience. But it's a shame that MGMT's live show moves along with a “three for them, the rest for us” quality. Their rendition of “Electric Feel” was explosive, but we consumed it with such inconsiderate greed that the band needn't be on stage to perform it at all. Emphasizing how far removed that song is from the band themselves, VanWyngarden attributed it to a pseudonym, cracking: “That's a song by the Electric Eel, it's called ‘Electric Feel.'”
The same goes for “Kids,” which featured a riveting mid-section riff on Limahl's campy, glorious “The Never Ending Story” that tragically seemed more fun for the band than the audience impatiently waiting for the original chorus to drop once more. Credit to MGMT for making their own amusement while delivering what's become their equivalent of Radiohead's “Creep,” projecting visuals of a festival crowd on the screen to really hammer home how people who see MGMT in 2018 still want the show to feel.
Hearing this song in in this context was a reminder that MGMT's early hits sent them down a path away from what they actually wanted to be, toward the rock-star lifestyle they sardonically parodied on “Time To Pretend.” “Kids” is hooky and immediate — the polar opposite of the catalogue the band put together in the years following — and now holds seemingly no significance to them except as a professional obligation. To hear it in the resulting interviews since Oracular Spectacular, the duo immediately bored themselves with the style that made them popular. Perhaps they should have chased their more experimental muse under a different moniker; the decision to keep at it under the MGMT banner came across as an obstinate effort to reclaim their brand back from the fans.
But in that regard they've unequivocally failed. Their new songs are vital, compelling works, yet in concert MGMT still feel like an entity imprisoned by their past. It's remarkable we didn't lose MGMT completely as they dug for true identity and threw the dirt back on to bury themselves alive — even more so that their period of soul-searching actually blossomed into something as self-assured as Little Dark Age. It's a shame that even at their most inspired, appreciation for who they are still remains outside their grasp.
While carrying on in good spirits during the show, cracking smiles and proving charming in their light-hearted disposition, the band wasn't having fun with us, but in spite of us. Just a little over a decade into their existence, MGMT are already treated as a legacy act running their course to dutifully let us remember an earlier, simpler time in our lives. And we should be grateful! Reliving the past is one of the most enjoyable ways to spend the present. But we should also appreciate what the band is creating right now, making sure it won't become nostalgia music that one day they will no longer be interested in letting us relive.

Bancor, a tech startup focused on electronic currency tokens, recently made close to $150 million in three hours on Monday during their initial coin offering or ICO.
Much like an initial public offering for stock in a company, the Bancor website said the offering has raised almost 400 thousand ether, the digital currency for the Ethereum digital currency network. Over 10,000 people bought tokens and when the digital currency is converted by its "sharehodlers" it totals up to big bucks in physical money.
If the previous paragraphs threw you for a loop or sounded like a bunch of gibberish, that's OK. It is complex.

Bancor is one of many companies creating their own digital money or cryptocurrency that can be sent worldwide instantly and isn't regulated by a central bank or government. Popularly referred to as Bitcoins, from the highly successful company of the same name, these digital coins filling up digital wallets could change the face of our economy in huge ways.
Take 2 minutes and watch this short video about how cryptocurrency works:
Outside of mass decentralization removing the middle men of banks and allowing for global instant transactions, there are several perks to using cryptocurrency. There are no fixed denominations of cryptocurrency so you can send someone 0.0001 coins or 10 million if you had enough. The makers of Bitcoin ensured a fixed number of coins, in this case 22 million, so that no one can dupe other users with "copies" of money because no new coins are being produced through a mint.
Everyone uses cryptocurrency has access to the "ledger" or account book so everyone can track transactions globally. Users on digital currency networks also have the added incentive of contributing their computers to the network by being given small fractions of coins for every transaction they help to verify.
There are numerous drawbacks to cryptocurrency not limitied to their limited acceptance as payment, digital wallet security, and most notably its volatile worth in relation to physical money. Regardless, this might have been the biggest public outing for cryptocurrency yet and as the markets and technology stabilize we might be seeing more digital coins in our lives as the months and years pass.

Bristol Live received reports from two people who passed the scene after the crash.
One person said: [I saw] the bike under the front tyres. The police are there and the road is closed. If ambulance was called they must have gone.”

Another member of the public said: “[I saw] the bike to the side of the car, kind of underneath. I didn't see the injured cyclist.
“A lot of paramedics and emergency response vehicles. I had just cycled to Tesco in Easton and came back the same way so it happened very recently.
A police spokesperson said: “The road traffic collision happened at about 9am this morning. A car and a cyclist collided.
“It looks like the cyclist, who was female, has been taken Southmead Hospital.
“At the moment her injuries are not thought to be life threatening.”
Tuesday saw 16 Halifax councillors ask last minute questions of municipal staff that would have seen drastic changes to how a $918.5 million budget would operate.
If that sounds frustrating, you weren't the only one — staff were forced to frantically perform calculations to give councillors the answers they wanted to know.
But by 2:00 p.m., Halifax had set its budget for the 2018-2019 fiscal year — defeating a last-minute motion to use $1.9 million of its $12 million surplus to reduce an average household tax increase to the originally predicted 1.6 per cent.
Throughout the day, staff had recommended that council not use surplus to reduce the tax increase.
“Reserves are not meant to fund current operations,” said Halifax's Chief Administrative Officer Jacques Dube.
The fiscal budget was the second budget in a new multi-year budget format for the municipality.
According to city staff, the strategy allows the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) to take advantage of “growth opportunities” and “mitigate forecasted challenges.”

As passed, the budget reflects an increase of their household tax bill by 1.975 per cent, which translates to an additional $37 for the average household's tax bill.
Municipal staff say that means the average tax bill for a family home is estimated at $1,917 and the average tax bill for a business will decrease to $40,966.
Councillor Bill Karsten said that he would not have been able to vote for a budget had the tax increase been higher than 1.9 per cent, and said he was happy with how it turned out.
“I urge us to vote for this unanimously,” Karsten said.
However, it wasn't unanimous. Council voted 15-2 in support of the budget, with councillor Tim Outhit and councillor Sean Cleary voting against it.
Fiscal challenges ahead
That doesn't mean everything is rosy for the municipality.
In an opening statement, Dube said there are many fiscal challenges ahead — including police wages.
Dube slammed the arbitration decision that set police services wages, calling further wage increases under arbitration to be “unsustainable.”

According to the budget, $157.9 million of the total $918.5 million budget is part of mandatory provincial fees for things like education.
As a result, total municipal expenditure is actually $760.8 million.
Staff characterized the municipality's debt, which has dropped by approximately 30 per cent in this budget, as one of the lowest municipal per-capita debts in the country.
Councillor Lindell Smith said that fact should be shouted from the mountaintops.
Council have now directed staff to come back next year with a two-year operating budget that will cover the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 fiscal year.

BMW built approximately 457 M1 super coupes. This production run lasted from 1978 up through 1981, during which time BMW teamed up with Lamborghini to deliver its wedge-shaped machine as a homologation special. To press more cars into the hands of buyers, BMW created the M1 Procar Championship. This one-make racing series ran for two years and drew participation from some colossal names from the racing world.
Today, the M1 Procar racers appear at a handful of high-level vintage racing events. Such was the case recently at Spa-Francorchamps, where three of the cars were set loose.
CHECK OUT: 2017 Honda Civic Type R first drive review: track attacker
The sound you're hearing comes courtesy of a road-racing variant of a remarkable street car. The M1 Procar racers are a bit different in a number of ways compared to the road cars--most notable is the fact that their M88 straight-6 engines make 470 horsepower compared to the 273 horses of the road cars. The cars also have adjustable anti-roll bars, adjustable brake bias, and race-ready steering racks.
We don't think the road car ever spit this much hot fire, either. The tail area of these M1s are running rather hot as they rip and roars through the famed Belgian circuit. It's an amazing sight to behold, but it also means a lot of unburnt fuel is finding its way through the engines. It looks cool, but it's not efficient.
Still, we'll take cool over efficient when it comes to a car like the BMW M1 Procar.

The BC Lions crashed an aquafit class in Kamloops this week
If you like their moves on the field you'll be delighted with what they bring to the pool.
The BC Lions held their annual training camp in Kamloops this past week, but what was different about this year was an impromptu team workout session.
The football players piled into the pool at the Canadian Games Aquatic Centre for a little aquafit workout.
Several members of the Lions were filmed splashing about after taking a break from their training at Hillside Stadium.
Players also invited members of the public to attend their club's 2018 FanFest, last weekend, where those big and small had a chance to watch a practice and meet the Lions.
The team will be in Kamloops until June 7 for training.

SAN FRANCISCO – A man dressed in a UPS uniform and armed with an “assault pistol” opened fire at a United Parcel Service Inc package sorting hub in San Francisco, killing three people before turning the gun on himself, police said.
Police did not identify the suspect or say if he was a UPS employee. They told a news conference the incident was not terrorism-related and they recovered two firearms from the scene.
Two other people were shot and have been taken to an area hospital, police said.
The shooter and the victims were all drivers, said Steve Gaut, head of investor relations at UPS. The incident took place while the workers were gathered for their daily morning meeting before going out on their routes, he added.
Gaut said the facility's employees have been released from work and he believes most have left the building. The company is providing trauma and grief counseling to employees.

Live video showed a massive police presence near the facility, with workers being led out and embracing each other on the sidewalk outside.
“The company is saddened and deeply concerned about affected employees, family members and the community we share. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those touched by this incident,” UPS said in a statement.
Victims were taken to the Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, spokesman Brent Andrew said. He said he could not say how many patients were taken to the hospital or give their conditions.
In 2014, a man shot and killed two of his supervisors before turning the gun on himself at a UPSdistribution center in Birmingham, Alabama. The gunman had recently been fired from the facility.
There should be zero tolerance for pot use by drivers or their passengers, a new report by the Canadian Mental Health Association Ontario branch recommends.
The report, Cannabis Legalization and Regulation, also says that all marijuana revenue should go to fund mental health and addiction services, and that the minimum age to purchase the product should be 19 years old.
“The risk is that legalization of cannabis may lead to an increase in use among Ontarians,” Camille Quenneville, CEO of CMHA Ontario, said in a statement Monday. “When taken together, our recommendations can minimize the harms associated with cannabis use and support a public health approach to this issue.”
As the Justin Trudeau government gets set to legalize pot by July 2018, CMHA Ontario prepared a report for the provincial government with recommendations on how to go forward.
The report says marijuana legalization should be viewed through a public health lens.
CMHA Ontario anticipates an increased need for mental health and addiction support services with legal pot, especially for youth and heavy consumers “ranging from brief interventions for at-risk users to more intensive interventions,” as well as extensive public education campaigns.
The “most concerning” issue is driving high, with data already showing that an estimated 10.4 million vehicle trips a year involve a motorist that had used marijuana, the report says.
Testing for drug-impaired driving may not accurately reflect the level of impairment, it says.
“Because the technology to detect an individual's level of impairment due to cannabis is still in development at this time, CMHA Ontario recommends a zero-tolerance policy for cannabis consumption in any motorized vehicle in order to ensure road safety during this time of transition,” the report says. “A zero-tolerance policy would include both the driver of the motorized vehicle, and any passengers in the car. It is important that a clear message be sent to the public as soon as possible regarding zero tolerance for impaired driving due to cannabis use.”
While the Canadian Medical Association, which represents the nation's doctors, called for a minimum legal pot-buying age of 21, CMHA Ontario suggested the lower age of 19.
“Frequent cannabis use can harm a developing brain and there is no evidence that supports a specific age when cannabis use is safe for young people,” the report says. “However, there are concerns that a higher minimum age may contribute to young people accessing cannabis from illegal sources. Establishing a higher minimum age standard will be less effective in undermining the black market, and may leave youth both criminalized and reliant on it.”

The Blitzboks continued their superb form with three comfortable pool stage wins on the first day of the New Zealand leg of the World Sevens Series in Hamilton on Saturday.
As a result‚ the Blitzboks will face Scotland in the last eight. If they win their quarterfinal‚ a semi against either last week's Sydney winners Australia‚ or Kenya awaits the Blitzboks.
SA‚ who were top of the World Series standings on 58 points going into the weekend‚ beat Papua New Guinea 36-5 in their first match and followed that with a 38-0 win over Russia.
Their final Pool B match was against old rivals England‚ but the Blitzboks were too good winning 28-7 after running into a 21-0 half-time lead.
Try glutton Seabelo Senatla scored six tries on the day‚ two in each match‚ to move closer to fourth on the all-time try-scorers with 217‚ just three behind England's Ben Gollings. He is also the 2017-18 season's top try scorer with 28 and the leading points' scorer on 140 in 21 matches.
SA were one of three undefeated teams on day one‚ along with New Zealand and Fiji‚ while the Blitzboks' 102 points‚ was the most by any team.
Despite their good results‚ captain Kyle Brown was not entirely happy with their early performances against the two minnows in their Pool.
“If you look at the first two games‚ there were a lot of wobbly moments‚ and I don't know if it is coming from stress‚ or nerves or something else‚” Brown said.
“We are playing in a brand-new venue for the first time‚ so perhaps that's part of it.
“But I'm really happy with the way we settled down in the second half against Russia and then came out against England with a clinical performance.
“That kind of accuracy we showed in the last game today‚ is going to be needed in the knockouts.”

Paul Monoxide Child Methric is blown away I havent had to work a job in 20 years.
That doesnt mean the rapper  who formed the Livonia-based Twiztid in 1997 with fellow MC Jamie Madrox Spaniolo  hasnt been working. Hard.
The duo has spent the past two decades not only making music (11 studio albums, including this years The Continuous Evilution of Lifes ?s, 10 EPs, seven compilations and a mixtape) but also building their Magik Ninja Entertainment, established during 2014, into a self-contained, multifaceted empire thats home to other artists and also makes films and other products, from apparel to soft drinks.
But Methric, 43, is loath to call any of that a job.
Advertisement
Im not going in to punch a clock, 9 to 5, yknow? he says by phone. When I grew up, that was actually making it. Just having a 9 to 5, you were doing really good. But we took a chance at the right time.
And we never take it for granted. Every day is like the first day, so to speak; We dont really have a chance to sit back and actually look at what weve done and what weve been part of. I guess well do that when its all done.
Methric figures he and Spaniolo are a long way from that, however. The two have taken a card from their original musical home, Insane Clown Posses Psychopathic Records, and now juggle a variety of projects with Magik Ninja, housed in an industrial facility Twiztid calls the dojo.
Twiztid is finalizing a script for a horror movie it hopes to put into production this year, and it has a comic book series slated to start later this year. There are also customized soft drinks  Redrum Strawberry Soda and Sour Apple Sludge  and plans to release another 10 CDs this year, including Twiztids Triple Threat project with Blaze Ya Dead Homie.
Were really pushing the other artists, Methric explains. That was the whole point of us getting our record out in the first quarter, so we can take a back seat, almost, and show the world what this record label is all about. And truth be told, Methric says its the behind-the-scenes machinations of Magik Ninja that excited him even more than putting on his war paint and performing in Twiztid.
What Ive found is that I love the business aspect of the music business, says Methric, who was about to take a $17-an-hour tow truck job 20 years ago when Spaniolo proposed the idea of forming Twiztid. I love music, but I dont really like making music. It was something I did cause my friends were doing it.
But I am infatuated with the business aspect of it. Thats where my love and passion is. I took pride in learning every nuance of the business. I used to get talked to by management and wouldnt know what they were saying. Now I know more than they do, and I love It. I just want to learn more and do more.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will call on Monday for his chief trade adviser to investigate China's intellectual property practices, website Politico reported, citing an unnamed administration official.
Trump had been expected to order a so-called Section 301 investigation under the 1974 Trade Act earlier this month, but action had been postponed as the White House pressed for China's cooperation in reining in North Korea's nuclear program.
Politico said it was not clear how much detail Trump would provide in his announcement, but that administration officials expected U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to open a section 301 probe.
Officials at the White House and U.S. Trade Representative's office were not immediately available for comment.
Trump has suggested he would go easier on China if it were more forceful in getting North Korea to rein in its nuclear weapons program.
While China joined in a unanimous U.N. Security Council decision to tighten economic sanctions on Pyongyang over its long-range missile tests, it is not clear whether Trump thinks Beijing is doing enough.
"We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel," he told reporters on Thursday. "If China helps us, I feel a lot different toward trade."
Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Friday night. They reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, the White House said in a statement.
"President Trump and President Xi agreed North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behavior," the statement said.
The White House said the "relationship between the two presidents is an extremely close one, and will hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea problem."
Trump will make a day trip to Washington, D.C., on Monday, briefly interrupting his 17-day August working vacation, a White House official said on Friday.
Politico said the investigation would not mean immediate sanctions, but could ultimately lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods.
In addition to the United States, the European Union, Japan, Germany and Canada have all expressed concern about China's behavior on intellectual property theft. The technology sector has been especially hard hit in IP disputes.
Trump's threat to investigate China's intellectual property and trade practices is valid, but his administration may not be up to the delicate task of carrying out a new China probe without sparking a damaging trade war, U.S. business lobbyists said last week.

The streets of Cardiff were littered with used textbooks, cutlery, furniture and even cars packed with rubbish.
Alleyways around the Cathays area, a hotspot for student living, became dumping grounds for wrecked sofas and mattresses, reports Wales Online .
As of July 1 hundred students have flocked from the city, ready for two months of bliss in the sunshine before embarking on a new year of studying.
The car park at Cathays train station, used by thousands of students, was covered in rubbish overflowing from a YCMA donation bank.

At its foot lies a full deconstructed kitchen, Tupperware, chopping boards, bowls, pots and pans and bottles of ketchup and mayonnaise all piled up.
Expensive-looking textbooks, chairs, hairbrushes and DVDs were also poking out of the throng.
As Paleontolgy postgraduate student Richard Jones walks past he stops to take a quick picture on his phone.
He said: "I was walking past a few weeks ago and there was a guy saying there was a handbag there that was selling for £30 on eBay.
"He said he was going back the next day and fill the car up."
A few minutes walk from the station lies Miskin Street.
On the corner two green and white striped deck chairs stand ready for their occupants to return and enjoy the sunshine.

On closer inspection, however, the seats are ripped, with a large bottle of Smirnoff vodka lying yards away.
Meanwhile others have taken to twitter to share pictures of the mess, including a car left full to bursting with belongings.
A few yards away builder Christopher Williams is hard at work, gutting a house under the beating sun.
The plan is to turn the semi-detached house from separate flats to one big HMO, or house in multiple occupation.
For him the state of empty student houses are something he has had to get used to, although the smell of rotting food never quite goes away.
The 39-year-old said: "When I started I was shocked.
"Mainly it's just dust and dirt but you do expect that. Then there are freezers full of stuff, food in the cupboards, in the fridges.
"It's all mouldy but what can you do? When you have a fridge with no electricity you just have to see what's in it.
"The smell just hits you. [My colleague] has got a really weak stomach.
"It's just sad for the landlords, they put their hearts into these places."

In a matter of weeks the house will be completely renovated ready for a new batch of inhabitants.
Luckily, not everything inside it will be scrapped.
The Cardiff builder said: "Nine times out of ten I will take things to charity shops so they can make a bit of money.
"This morning someone came and picked up two cookers, gas hobs and extractor fans.
"If you give them a bit of a clean most of it can be re-used.
"Sometimes there are clothes with tags still on."
A few doors down from Christopher postgraduate student Jessica Jones is busy scrubbing her front yard to remove the debris from last year's tenants.
Today is her second day in Cardiff after moving from Manchester to study music.
The 22-year-old said: "The street looks derelict but inside the houses are quite nice.
"I come from Manchester so I'm quite used to use but there are some messy students around here.
"A lot of people have left stuff they don't really want. There are a few interesting bits, chairs, barbecues.
"The amount of money that students get through is crazy, things become disposable after a year."
Around Cathays other students have had similar experiences.

She said: "It's stressful. You have to make sure everything is spick and span while making sure you get your own stuff ready.
"Some people just don't care and the sea gullscome and open the bags. We try our best obviously because there are families near but you can't help it when the seagulls are ripping everything.
"The worst is the food left in the recycling bins. In this heat it's horrible, I have to hold my breath walking past it."
Around Cardiff there are thought to be 75,000 students across Cardiff University , Cardiff Metropolitan and the University of South Wales.
On Tuesday afternoon Cardiff council maintenance teams and members of Cardiff University are circling the area, determined to keep up with the volume of rubbish coming from each house.
On Rhymney Street local landlord Michael Krokos is getting ready to go visit one of the seven HMOs he owns across Cardiff.
Born and bred in the city, he claims to know every tenant on a first name basis to minimize the risk of nasty shocks when they move out.
The 50-year-old Cardiff graduate said: "It's quite spooky like this. It feels like one of those zombie movies."
He added: "The problem is not so much the students but relying on the duty contractors as you book them months in advance like the cleaners, painters, decorators. They know they've got you in a tight position so they can mess you around or not turn up."
A bigger problem still for Michael is absentee landlords who are not so quick to clean and update houses.
He said: "There are issue with landlords but the first thing I try and do if you find out what the agents are and if the agents aren't going to be compliant I go to the registry office to find out who owns it."

Sex doll found in skip at student digs after horrified man spots LEG sticking out of rubbish
To help with the big move out a 'Love When You Leave Campaign' has been set up to make students aware of how to get rid of rubbish.
A spokeswoman for Cardiff University said: “We are one of three universities in the city centre and we take our responsibilities to the local community and other residents extremely seriously.
“Together with our Students' Union, we work hard to ensure that all of our students are made aware of their responsibilities around waste, recycling and charity collections throughout the year.
“We are a partner in the ‘Love When you Leave Campaign', which helps ensure students living in the city centre are aware of waste collection dates, donation points and what to do with unwanted goods at the end of term.
“The University and Students' Union also work closely with Cardiff City Council to ensure we take a co-ordinated approach to messages around responsible waste disposal and recycling.”
Michael Michael, Cardiff council cabinet member for clean streets and recycling, said: “All students need to plan ahead when they leave their rented property so that any unrecyclable or unusable waste is put out for collection on the correct waste collection day.
“Failure to do this causes an eyesore for other residents and the rubbish bags are often ripped open by seagulls causing large levels of street litter If students persist on doing this, they will receive a Fixed Penalty Notice.
"A great deal of time and effort has been put into providing the various recycling and reuse schemes through the Love When You Leave Campaign and we ask everyone to plan ahead and use the facilities provided.”

President Moon Jae-in has said that it is "delusional thinking" for North Korea to believe that nuclear weapons will guarantee its security, urging Pyongyang to stop such misjudgment and come out to denuclearization talks.
In a recent interview with China's state-run CCTV, which was aired Monday (local time), Moon also underlined the importance of "close cooperation" between Seoul and Beijing in making Pyongyang give up its nuclear ambitions.
"It is delusional thinking for small countries like North Korea that lag behind in terms of economy to say that they can protect their security only with nuclear weapons," Moon said. "Rather, inter-Korean peace and cooperation will protect its security."
"Therefore, it is very important for the North to change its perception on the nuclear issue and come on to the path toward denuclearization," he added.
(Yonhap)
The interview was held ahead of Moon's four-day state visit to China, which starts on Wednesday, during which he plans to hold a summit with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.The China trip comes after North Korea test-fired what it claims to be a new intercontinental ballistic missile in late November, raising tensions around the Korean Peninsula.Moon underlined the importance of China in resolving the North nuclear stalemate."I think what is most needed is close cooperation between South Korea and China," Moon said. "(I) believe that there will surely be a good outcome should South Korea and China make efforts to bring the North to the negotiating table while taking the same stance (on denuclearization)."He affirmed that Seoul and Beijing have the same stance on the North Korean nuclear issue, as they believe that sanctions and pressure are needed to prevent further provocations and that peaceful methods should be employed to resolve it.Moon said that things are "very grave" as the North continues provocations and quickly upgrades its missile capability.Asked about the upcoming visit to China, Moon placed his top priority on recovering mutual trust between the two countries that he said has been undermined "significantly" in recent months, apparently pointing to the feud over the deployment of a US missile defense system called THAAD in South Korea."The top priority of my visit to China is placed on recovering mutual trust," he said. "I think relations based on mutual trust are a very important starting point for advancing relations going forward."Moon reiterated Seoul's stance on THAAD, saying it was an "inevitable" decision for South Korea to allow its installation to defend itself from North Korea's nuclear and missile threats.The president still recognized the concerns that China has about THAAD and noted that South Korea will make sure that the missile defense armament will not violate China's security interests."South Korea will pay extra heed to make sure that THAAD will not go beyond its (intended) objectives of defending against the North's nuclear and missile threats and hurt China's security interests," he said. "I can say that we have been assured by the United States on this matter." (Yonhap)
Calling the hogs: After dispute, Fayetteville landowner plans hog farm March 16, 2018
A landowner says he's going to put hogs and goats on his land near a residential community just outside the city after neighbors complained about his plans for a commercial building.
The Washington County Planning Board denied landowner Pat Tobin's request for a permit to build a 4,890-square-foot metal building on 20 acres at 4012 Old Wire Road last month.
Tobin originally planned to build several metal buildings to lease to businesses, according to county records. Staff recommended approving the project, but several of Tobin's neighbors voiced concerns over compatibility and drainage. He took his proposal for a single, commercial building for his own business to the board last month. Neighbors objected to that, too.
“Since they didn't want the commercial, I guess they prefer the sows,” Tobin said. “So, that's what we'll give them.”
Tobin's plans include a small, residential structure and a farm with four pens for up to 20 pigs per pen. Pens also will be dedicated to goats, he said. The farm will be a “mix” between a hobby and professional farm to provide organic meat products directly to clients, he said.
Tobin put up a sign last week for J&B Hog-Goat Farm. J and B are the first initials of his grandchildren. He parked a bulldozer beside the sign.
The move sparked more concern among neighbors, who said it seemed Tobin was being vindictive after the Planning Board turned down his commercial plan.
“I'd say he's pretty angry,” neighbor Tim Foster said. “He seems to be fairly obstinate in a ‘you can't tell me what to do' mentality.”
Some neighbors called county planners, who went to the site Friday. The property is zoned for agricultural or single-family home use. Tobin has the right to use his property for those two categories without Planning Board approval, Senior Planner Nathan Crouch said.
Fayetteville doesn't have a say over whether Tobin puts farm animals on his property, said Andy Harrison, development coordinator for the city's Planning Division. The property is outside the city's jurisdiction, even though it is within the city's 1-mile planning area, he said. The county notifies the city about developments that require waivers from county zoning and are within the planning area, but the city has no regulating power.
Tobin said he doesn't need a permit from the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, which oversees environmental issues including stormwater runoff. An agency spokeswoman said in email Tuesday the agency needs more information to determine any requirements. Tobin hasn't filed for any state environmental agency permits, state records show.
The state Health Department has issued a permit for a small septic system on the property.
Tobin said he plans to break ground on the project this week. He said he's still working on the business aspect of his plan.
The farm is near Mud Creek, which flows into Fayetteville, neighbor Joseph “Jodie” McAlister said. McAlister and others said they are worried about environmental problems from the farm.
“The whole city of Fayetteville will be affected by this if the runoff gets into Mud Creek,” said McAlister, whose property is directly across the road from Tobin's. The creek is an urban tributary to the Illinois River. McAlister was in favor of Tobin's commercial building — with conditions.
Tobin hasn't talked with his neighbors. At least two speculated the farm was a hoax, even though Tobin broached the idea during the Planning Board meeting last month.
“I guess we didn't take it seriously,” neighbor Christina Gall said. “I'm kind of thinking he just kind of made it up, but I don't know. That sign just went up. All the neighbors were like ‘Oh, OK.'”
Tobin bought the property across from Gall and McAlister last year, county records show.
He said he hasn't talked with neighbors or county planners about his plans.
“I see no reason to,” he said.
Tobin said he won't appeal the Planning Board's decision to the Quorum Court. He can get revenue — which was all he wanted — through the farm instead of the commercial rentals, he said.
Gall said Tobin's idea is better than the commercial rental space.
“I'd rather live across the street from a hog farm than a big rental project,” she said.
Police raided two shopping malls in Pattaya on Thursday and arrested five vendors for allegedly selling fake brand-name watches and handbags.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (Alabama Athletics) – Alabama outfielder Chandler Taylor was the first pick of the 27th round (796 overall) in the 2017 MLB First-Year Player Draft, going to the Minnesota Twins. Taylor was the second player taken in this year's draft from the 2016-17 Crimson Tide roster, joining Garrett Suchey, who was taken earlier in the day.
A two-year starter at Alabama, Chandler Taylor has been a force in the Crimson Tide lineup, serving as the primary cleanup hitter in each of the last two seasons. Taylor batted .278 (107-385) with 25 home runs and 67 RBI while adding 67 runs scored in his two seasons with the Crimson Tide. His efforts earned him postseason all-conference recognition each year, including All-SEC Freshman Team honors in 2016 followed by a Second Team All-SEC selection in 2017.
Taylor finished 2017 as the team leader in seven offensive categories including: home runs (16), RBI (34), runs (39), walks (32), stolen bases (7-11), slugging percentage (.601) and total bases (113). His numbers also placed him among league leaders, ranking third in home runs, fifth in slugging and ninth overall in total bases during the regular-season. In SEC play, Taylor led UA's everyday starters in average at .295 (33-112), while contributing a team-leading 10 home runs, 15 RBI, 19 runs scored, 71 total bases and 16 walks. His .634 slugging and .382 on-base percentage also led the team, while his eight doubles and three stolen bases each tied for the team-high mark. Against SEC opponents during the regular season, Taylor ranked fourth in home runs, fifth in slugging percentage and seventh in total bases across the league.
As a freshman, Taylor started all 56 games that he played, finishing with a .274 (54-197) average, adding nine home runs and a team-high 40 walks on his way to Freshman All-SEC recognition. In SEC play, Taylor led the Tide in average (.295), RBI (25), extra-base hits (16), total bases (63), walks (24), slugging (.600) and on-base percentage (.435).

With big corporations such as HSBC and Virgin actively encouraging their employees to work from home, a new survey has found that 38% of Scots spend their remote working hours doing personal tasks.
And when they are doing the job in hand, 62% do so in their pyjamas.
A recent study finds that the number of people working from home has increased by a fifth in 10 years and home insurer, Together Mutual Insurance have conducted some new research to find out why people are working from home, in addition to how companies are having to change to accommodate this trend.
The main reason employees dodge the workplace and opt to work from home is to avoid their commute - and with rail fares facing the biggest rise for five years, this is no surprise.
Additionally, over a third opt to work from home to avoid the distraction of their colleagues, allowing them to concentrate on their work.
Meanwhile, nearly a quarter (24%) decide to stay home so that they can take a break whenever they feel like it, with nearly one in 10 taking advantage of a long lunch.
Of the 38% which get distracted when working from home, the causes of procrastination are:
Chatting to friends and family at home - 59%
Doing household chores - 58%
Running personal errands - 49%
The survey also reveals that 23% of Scots would work from home more if it were not for their company putting a limit on the number of days allowed, suggesting that businesses are limiting their employees' productivity and flexibility.
Jon Craven, CEO of Together Mutual Insurance said: “With the average person working from home 13 days a year, companies are having to accommodate for this with equipment and remote-working friendly IT systems.
“Our findings highlighted that the average person needs £2097 worth of technology in order to work remotely and with 38% of people claiming to get distracted during work hours, it begs the question as to how beneficial remote working is for businesses.”
Da'Shawn Hand's smile is infectious. It stretches from ear to ear, pushing up his pudgy baby cheeks, and it was on full display when he took on a starring role during Alabama's two College Football Playoff media days.
First, he paraded around the Georgia Dome in Atlanta with a microphone in hand as he interviewed or lampooned his teammates before the Crimson Tide's 24-7 victory over Washington. A week later, Alabama's reserve defensive end took Amalie Arena by storm in Tampa, Florida, with more wit, more video cameras shoved in his face, and, of course, that boyish grin winning over media members and fans alike before Alabama's showdown with Clemson in the national championship game.
By all accounts, this exactly who Hand is. He's a lovable, large man who knows how to keep the laughs going and the smiles shining.
But there's another side of Hand that has only been seen in flashes during his three years in Tuscaloosa. There's a wilder, more aggressive Hand who in spurts has proven to be every bit of the top recruit Nick Saban signed. The hope in Tuscaloosa is that Hand's final year will be a breakout season to remember.
“He's really taking his [situation] the best way he can," linebacker Rashaan Evans said of Hand. "I know when he gets out on the field [as a starter], he's gonna ball.”
A gentle giant of sorts during his media day gallivanting, Hand will be called upon for more time in the limelight and more opportunities to show that there is a grizzly bear behind that teddy-bear smile. And on paper, it will be a long time coming after Hand arrived on campus as a five-star stud with sack records twinkling in his eyes.
But the 6-foot-4, 280-pound Hand hasn't exactly lived up to the hype that was strapped to his back when he enrolled. In three seasons, Hand has seven sacks and 12 tackles for loss in a reserve role for the Crimson Tide.
Those aren't exactly blue-chip numbers, but that hasn't deterred Hand. Guys such as Jonathan Allen, Jarran Reed, A'Shawn Robinson and Dalvin Tomlinson passed him by to achieve star status along Alabama's front, but he doesn't look at that as a negative. He enjoys the successes of his teammates as much as he'd enjoy his own, and he has embraced his reserve role. To him, if it helps the team, then he's in the right place.
“It humbles you and gives you a different outlook on things," Hand said. "Hard work is the key to everything.
"You get what you earn."

And this time around, Hand has a chance to earn a lot as a major breakout candidate for the Tide. Not only is Hand physically imposing with that monstrous 6-foot-4, 280-pound frame, but he has the athleticism and agility of a much smaller man. He can play both inside and outside -- which has been very beneficial when you consider the fluctuations in weight he's dealt with over the past three years -- and his combination of strength and get-off has Hand primed to end his Alabama career the way many thought he'd begin it.
He's also learned from one of the best to ever play for the Tide.
“Da'Shawn's come a long way," said Allen, who won the Lombardi Award in 2016. "That's my dog right there and I'm excited to see what he does and I'm excited about his future.”
Allen would know. He's been along Hand's ride every step of the way until now. Hand considers Allen his "big brother," and the two actually go back as far as their high school football days in Virginia. With Hand playing in Woodbridge and Allen in Ashburn, they kept in close contact and mirrored each other on the field.
During Allen's high school sophomore year in the fall of 2010, he registered 20 sacks. A year later, Hand totaled 21 as a sophomore. In 2012, Hand passed his big bro with 16 sacks to Allen's nine as a senior. Hand said topping the other on the field served as motivation.
“It was like I was chasing him," Hand said.
Hand chased Allen all the way to Alabama, where he became the ultimate student to Allen's teaching. Allen mentored Hand in his image. While we haven't exactly seen a younger version of Allen, the seed has been planted in Hand's mind that the Allen way is the way he's trying to go.
He's lived that life behind closed doors, but it's still been a long road to this point. Hand has every reason to be down about not reaching star status early in his Alabama career. But at a program that churns out NFL talent with ease, Hand is as happy now as he was when he first got on Alabama's campus. The wide-eyed, overly confident freshman (at times) who watched what he thought were slower linemen blow past him during his first college practice has morphed into a more confident and smarter player who obsesses over improving.
And while he knows the pressure is coming, Hand dismisses it. He's too busy getting excited about getting back on the field.
“Just don't think about it so much and worry about what makes me happy," he said.
And that is?
"Success. ... Just like with shooting or painting, you just have to work on your craft.”
Speaking at a news conference with the president of France, Trump strongly defended Jackson as “one of the finest people that I have met,” but he hinted that Jackson might soon withdraw from consideration, blaming Democrats for mounting an unfair attack on his nominee's record.
“I don't want to put a man through a process like this,” Trump said, calling the allegations about Jackson “ugly.” The president said, “The fact is, I wouldn't do it. What does he need it for? To be abused by a number of politicians?”
“It's totally his decision,” Trump added, saying that he had talked with Jackson earlier in the day. Trump angrily accused his adversaries on Capitol Hill of going after Jackson because they had failed to block Mike Pompeo, the president's nominee to become the next secretary of state.
“They failed to stop him, so now they say ‘who's next?'” the president told reporters during the news conference in the East Room.
The concern over Jackson's nomination, however, is bipartisan. The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee launched its investigation last week, and the committee's Republican and Democratic leaders jointly announced Tuesday that Jackson's confirmation hearing, planned for this Wednesday, would be postponed indefinitely.
“The Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs is postponing the hearing to consider the nominee to be secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in light of new information presented to the committee,” said Sens. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., the committee chairman, and Jon Tester of Montana, its top Democrat, in a joint statement which did not detail the allegations.
“We take very seriously our constitutional duty to thoroughly and carefully vet each nominee sent to the Senate for confirmation,” they added. “We will continue looking into these serious allegations and have requested additional information from the White House to enable the committee to conduct a full review.”
In a letter to the president, both senators requested “any and all communication” between the Defense Department, the White House Military Office and the White House medical unit “regarding allegations or incidents” involving Jackson back to 2006.
“I have very serious questions that need to be addressed, and they should be addressed right now, like today,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the committee.
Officials familiar with the allegations against Jackson declined to offer precise details but said that they suggest a pattern of behavior, not just one or two isolated incidents.
But Republicans did push back on the alcohol allegation. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said that Jackson told him during a one-on-one meeting Tuesday that “he has never had a drink while on duty.” Moran said Jackson did not specifically address other allegations against him, but indicated that he intended to move ahead as the nominee.
Republicans did indicate the charges are serious. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a member of the committee, said he was still waiting to see if the accusations “have weight” before rendering a judgment. But, he added, “If the allegations were based in fact, it would be concerning.”
Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy, was already expected to face difficult questioning during his testimony before the committee. Last month, Trump fired his first Veterans Affairs secretary, David J. Shulkin, an experienced hospital administrator and veteran of the VA medical system, and then chose Jackson largely out of personal affinity.
The White House did little or no vetting of his background before announcing his nomination on Twitter. Before serving as a White House physician, Jackson had deployed as an emergency medicine physician to Taqaddum, Iraq, during the Iraq War.
The nominee, speaking with reporters on Capitol Hill before meeting with a Republican senator Tuesday afternoon, gave no indication that he would withdraw. He said that he was “disappointed” that his confirmation hearing had been postponed. But he did not deny or answer questions about the charges.
“I'm looking forward to getting it rescheduled and answering everybody's questions,” he said.
The turmoil around his nomination all but ensures that the department, the federal government's second largest, will remain without a permanent leader for at least several weeks at a moment when it was supposed to be adopting systematic changes to its electronic health records system and programs that allow veterans to seek care from private doctors at government expense.
The Senate received paperwork from the Trump administration formalizing Jackson's nomination only last week.
“It has been really careless, maybe even negligent about the vetting in a number of these nominations,” Blumenthal said.
Senators were keeping the details of their investigation under wraps but let it be known that the allegations are serious. Sen. Mazie K. Hirono, D-Hawaii, a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, said she had heard enough from colleagues to have “deep concerns” about the nomination. “This is concerning even for a very ethically challenging White House,” she said.
Asked if he still supported the nominee, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, offered only, “We're going to wait and see what Sen. Isakson and the administration recommend.”
Committee Democrats met briefly Monday evening to discuss how to proceed. Tester is leading the investigation. Tester then met with Isakson on Tuesday morning shortly before announcing the postponement.
The White House defended Jackson's record in a statement, but did not address the nature of the claims against him.
“Adm. Jackson has been on the front lines of deadly combat and saved the lives of many others in service to this country. He's served as the physician to three presidents — Republican and Democrat — and been praised by them all,” said Hogan Gidley, a deputy White House press secretary. “Adm. Jackson's record of strong, decisive leadership is exactly what's needed at the VA to ensure our veterans receive the benefits they deserve.”
Lawmakers were already preparing to press Jackson on his views on the role of private medical care for veterans, instead of the department's government-run health care system. Senators planned to challenge his lack of management experience running a large organization. The department employs more than 370,000 people and operates sprawling health and veterans benefits systems.
Shulkin had been in the final stages of negotiating a contract to build a new, $10 billion electronic health records system that for the first time would be compatible with health records from both the military and community providers. The current system is 40 years old and fraught with inefficiencies that often get in the way of providing care.
A second large agenda item is redesigning the so-called “choice” rules that control when and how veterans use health care outside the government system. A compromise bill in Congress that streamlined the current system fell apart this winter. Veteran advocates fear that without strong leadership to push a new bill, veterans will be left with the current system, which many says is arbitrary and denies care to veterans in need.
Before his nomination, Jackson had garnered little public attention and his policy views were unknown. He took a rare turn in the spotlight in January, when he appeared on national television to announce the results of Trump's first physical while in office. At the time, there was speculation over the president's physical and mental health, and Jackson offered effusive compliments on both. Trump was pleased with the performance.
“I've found no reason whatsoever to think the president has any issues whatsoever with his thought processes,” Jackson said. At one point, he even quipped that given Trump's genetics, he might live to 200 years old if he had a healthier diet.
Trump fired his first Veterans Affairs secretary amid deep ideological disagreements over privatization of care at the department and extended fallout from a scathing report by its inspector general about a trip that Shulkin had taken last year to Britain and Denmark. Shulkin, a politically moderate physician and former hospital executive, remained well-liked on Capitol Hill and among veterans groups, who felt he was a pragmatic leader who understood the department intimately.

One of Charleston's heaviest traveled streets began its conversion for two-way traffic Friday.
Spring St. is now a two way street from King St. to Ashley Avenue.
City spokesman Jack O'Toole says Spring will be converted for two-way traffic from Ashley to President Street on Saturday.
O'Toole says Cannon Street will become a two-way street beginning Monday.
The plans have been in the works since 1998.
Residents of the Cannonborough-Elliotborough neighborhood have been pushing for the change to two-way streets.
Neighborhood Vice President Cator Sparks says he hopes it will discourage speeding.
Business owners also are thrilled. Rick Summers says he decided to open “The Bearded Cafe” when he learned Spring Street was going to become a two-way street.
Summers says now people driving down Spring St. will see his business.
City spokesman O'Toole says safety cones in the middle of the street will remain there until Monday.
Officials say the project also includes new curbs, street lighting and pedestrian crossing signals.

PML-N board to decide on tickets

LAHORE - The civil society urged the government to implement recommendations accepted by Pakistan to improve the situation of human rights in the country under the Universal Periodic Review, generally known as UPR.
This was demanded at a media briefing on Pakistan's International Obligations towards Child Rights organised by Child Rights Movement and Search For Justice to review government's performance to implement Children's Rights specific UPR's recommendation, through legislative, administrative and other possible measures.
Reema Omer from International Commission of Jurists shared that The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) was a mechanism under which the Human Rights Council examines the human rights situation in every member state of the United Nations. Each State is examined once every four years. The UPR is an inter-governmental process whereby the human rights records of a given country will be reviewed by other countries. During the last review, she said, Pakistan was given a number of recommendations for taking appropriate administrative, legislative and other measures to improve the overall situation of human rights. Human Rights Council will review performance of Pakistan in November 2017. Being a responsible member of international community, government must fulfil obligations under Universal Periodic Review, she said.
Rashida Qureshi, Coordinator Child Rights Movement & CAN Pakistan, shared that there was no mechanism of collection of children's rights violation data. She regretted that despite incidents like sexual abuse and exploitation in Kasur, government did not come up with Child Protection Policy or any plan of action or road map to prevent such incidents in future. Both federal and provincial governments have lot to do in terms of action for implementing UPR's recommendations to show seriousness with child rights issues.
Child Rights Activist Iftikhar Mubarik shared that in 2012 Pakistan was urged to undertake measures including establishment of independent monitoring mechanism, enact legislation to prohibit and prevent the employment of children as domestic workers, ratification of the Optional Protocol to UNCRC on the involvement of children in armed conflicts, expedite the adoption of the Charter of Child Rights Bill which is pending since last many years, strengthen measures aimed at providing protection and assistance to vulnerable segments of society, including those children affected by natural disasters to protect them from trafficking and exploitation at work, take steps to implement laws and policies with a view to eliminating early and forced marriage.
Child Rights Movement's member Sana Khawaja regretted that the government has not come up with legislative action to prohibit child domestic labor, as this was contemporary form of slavery too. She appreciated prohibiting child labour at brick kilns and demanded similar steps to address the issues of child domestic labour.

LONDON-With telescopes becoming even more sensitive, astronomers have managed to spot two tiny new moons orbiting Jupiter.
The moons, which are being referred to as ‘moonlets' due to their small size, measure just one mile across each.
The discovery brings the gas giant's total number of moons to 69.
The two new moons were discovered by researchers from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC, using the Magellan-Baade reflector at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.
The moons are yet to be named, and are currently being referred to as S/2016 J 1 and S/2017 J 1 – where S stands for Satellite, and J stands for Jupiter.
Their discovery came as a surprise to the astronomers, who were looking for objects in the outer solar system when they spotted the moonlets.
Speaking to Sky and Telescope, Dr Scott Sheppard, who led the team, said: ‘We were continuing our survey looking for very distant objects in the outer solar system, which includes looking for Planet X, and Jupiter just happened to be in the area we were looking in 2016 and 2017.' Both the new moons appear to be in a retrograde orbit, in which they move in the opposite direction to Jupiter around its axis.
They both also have a high degree of inclination off the orbital plane of Jupiter, which suggests that they were probably captured by Jupiter when they drifted too close to the gravitational pull of the planet, according to the researchers.
The orbits of both moons are highly elongated, and take them far away from Jupiter, with S/2016 J 1 orbiting at an average distance of 12,800,246 miles (20,600,000 km) and S/2017 J 1 at a distance of 14,602,223 miles (23,500,000 km) from the host planet.
While the findings have helped planetary scientists to locate some of Jupiter's ‘lost moons', the team believes there are still more to be found. Dr Sheppard added: ‘We have for sure recovered five of the lost moons. ‘We have several more Jupiter moons in our new 2017 observations and likely have all of the lost moons in our new observations.'
* Philippines marks first losing week in nine * Vietnam posts first losing week in seven * Malaysia comes off 3-yr high, closes slightly firmer By Karthika Suresh Namboothiri Feb 2 (Reuters) - Philippine stock market rose on Friday, after three consecutive sessions of steep losses, while Singapore fell to its lowest close in two weeks. Broader Asia stumbled, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down more than 0.5 percent. Most Southeast Asian stock markets posted weekly declines, led by a 2.6 percent drop in Philippine shares. The Philippine index marked its first losing week in nine, although it firmed 0.8 percent in the session. Conglomerate JG Summit Holdings gained 1.8 percent in the session, while property developer SM Prime Holdings climbed 1.2 percent. The Indonesian index firmed 0.5 percent, boosted by financials, with Bank Central Asia hitting a record close. An index of the country's most liquid stocks ended 0.6 percent higher. Vietnam erased earlier losses to end 0.5 percent higher, with financials leading the charge. However, the market posted a 1 percent decline on the week, its first in seven. Meanwhile, Singapore shares fell 0.5 percent, bringing the weekly drop to 1 percent. Real estate and industrial stocks took a beating, with CapitaLand Ltd falling over 2 percent to a more than three-week low and Hutchison Port Holdings hitting its lowest close in nearly a year. Thai shares slipped as much as 0.3 percent as a boost from energy stocks was outweighed by losses in consumer staples and real estate. Malaysian index ended marginally stronger in lacklustre trade, after touching its highest in more than three years, as it resumed trade after two days of public holidays. The only market in Southeast Asia to record a weekly gain ended the week 0.9 percent firmer.

What is Hedging?
Hedging is a technique to protect the risk of investment in equity by opening up contrarian positions to make the position risk netral.
Hedging is used against the negative outcome of a possible event. Remember it doesn't prevent the event from happening, but if it does happen and if you're hedged, there isn't any impact of the event or at least not as worst as it could have been.
So, hedging, is a technique by which you won't make money but reduce the potential of a loss.
Why should one Hedge?
For long-term investors, when the market takes a corrective mode, there are 4 possibilities:
Wait and do nothing about it. Book out of the long position and buy again later. Hedge the open position. Use the dips to increase your position in the stock.
Doing nothing about it is never a good option even for a long term investor.
There are multiple reason why investor prefer to keep holding their cash long positions instead of booking out and getting back in:
Dividend – If company declares dividend, if you aren't holding your long positions, you aren't eligible for a dividend.
Save tax – If you are making handsome gains on your investment, selling off just ahead of the news can mean you will have to pay a capital gain tax which can be avoided with a hedge.
Save on brokerages – Buying and selling in the cash market has more brokerage than in futures and options and so you can save on the brokerages.
So once you want to keep holding your long positions and still want to be protected, you have an option to Hedge. Later we will see how one can hedge their positions.
The last option is to accumulate more good quality stocks using the short term turmoil. I always prefer this and use my investment checklist and the fundamental analysis to add more to my portfolio.
Where can one Hedge?
Heding has many forms: If you are long in particular stock in the cash market, you can hedge it with
A short position in the futures market.
Buy put option in the options market.
Have an index short position using the stock's beta with respect to the index.
A commodity position (gold, oil, etc) or a bond position
A different position in different stock in the cash market itself.
How Hedging Works?
1. Hedging with Futures, Options or Index
Let's see it with an example:
Say you own shares of Sun Pharma. You are a long-term (10+ years) investor but aren't sure about the short-term (1 year or so) issues in the Pharma sector. To protect from the fall in the stock you can either have a short position in futures or can buy a put option in the options market. More about buying a put option here.
If your stock price tumbles, your loss from the long term investment will be offset by gains in either the short position in the futures or from the put option.
Note that your cash market position should be of the multiple of the lot size in futures or options to hedge the completely.
Similarly, you can hedge against the dollar for investment in a purely export oriented company like an Infosys where as a long-term investor want to protect against the potential risk due to fluctuations in the forex rates.
Or one can take a short position in the index for a long position in the stock based on the stock beta with respect to the index.
Beta is a measure of divergence of the stock price with respect to the index or in simple terms, it is the relative performance of the stock with respect to the index.
Reuters provide more updated beta value of the stock and as of today Infosys has a beta of 0.44. So if you are long on Infy and want to hedge against the index, you should have at least 0.44 times your long position's short on Index.
So if you are invested 10L in Infy in cash market, you should have 4.4L short on index to hedge your long position.
If you are long on high beta stock where stock has a beta of more than one, your short position on Index will be higher.
Hedging with Alternate Cash Market Postion
Diversification is also a kind of hedging though not in a true sense still I prefer to hedge with stock diversification with a focused approach to investing. I avoid trading in futures, options, commodities and in forex to the extent that I don't have my account enabled to trade in them.
So I prefer diversification to hedge.
On 11th August 2017 when all major indices were down, my stock portfolio wasn't
Chart from Moneycontrol
The portfolio saver was Jubilant Life.
I prefer focus investing over diversified investing but prefer to be holding few companies in different sectors and rarely have more than one company in the same business.
When Should one Hedge?
Hedging (unlike diversification) is mainly news driven. When you expect a news where you aren't sure about the possible outcome, you can hedge your position.
Bad quarterly result for a company, rise in raw material prices for a company, before the union budget, before FED meets, before the RBI policies etc.
Once the volatility due to the news is discounted in the price, you can unhedge your position and let the profit rise.
Final Thoughts
There are debt funds, arbitrage funds but there aren't any hedge funds still avaialble in India. So it isn't very popular among Indian retail investors.
St. John's fire officials are investigating a mobile home fire that took place Saturday morning.
At approximately 11:49 a.m., units with the St. John's Fire District, Charleston, St. Andrews, James Island, and North Charleston Fire Departments, Charleston County EMS and Charleston County Sheriffs Department responded to a report of a residential structure fire on Cooke Road on Johns Island, according to Ryan Kunitzer with the St. John's Fire District.
The first fire department units that arrived on scene reported heavy fire venting from multiple windows of a single story mobile home structure, fire officials say.
Landscapers that were working nearby discovered the fire and alerted residents in the immediate area.
The fire heavily damaged multiple rooms of the structure, fire officials say.
Smoke and heat damage was noted throughout the structure.
The house was unoccupied at the time of the fire, and no injuries were reported.
Investigators with the St. John's Fire Marshal Division responded to investigate the fire. The cause of fire is still under investigation.

When Ayelet Freedman assigned her Grade 7 students to work on a math problem in groups last year, a 12-year-old girl said she was “too stupid” to work with her classmates.
“She wasn't looking for attention, she was convinced she was stupid,” says Freedman, a math and language teacher in Ontario's York Region.
So she pulled the student aside, assured her she wasn't stupid and asked her to try to work with the other students, many of whom were chatty and confident about math.
READ MORE: The lessons your kids aren't learning in school but should
“By the end of the year she was more verbal and was participating more and was more confident,” Freedman says.
Confidence in math has become a major problem for girls, research and data show. Experts believe it is one of the reasons women are vastly outnumbered by men in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professions later in life.
Differences in math confidence between boys and girls show up as early as Grade 3 in Ontario, despite girls and boys scoring similar marks. That trend continues through to high school.
According to the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) standardized test in the 2016-17 academic year, only 49 per cent of Grade 3 girls in Ontario agreed that they were good at math compared to 62 per cent of boys.
The difference widens in Grade 6, where 46 per cent of girls said they were good at math compared to 61 per cent of boys.
“These attitudes are very important — they are significant predictors of math-related career choices,” says Mary Reid, a professor of math education at the University of Toronto's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, who studies the differences between the sexes.
Some of the reasons are well known: stereotypes that perpetuate the myth that men are better at math and science while women are better at nurturing careers, lack of female role models in a given field and problems at home, Reid says. But another reason that has gained research attention in recent years is what's known as math anxiety, she says.
A seminal study in 2009 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America showed American female elementary teachers passed on their anxieties about math to girls in their classes, but not to boys.
It is a vicious cycle, Reid says, because elementary school teachers in both the United States and Canada are overwhelmingly female. It's about 90 per cent in the United States, according to that study. In Ontario, 83 per cent of elementary teachers are female, according to the most recent EQAO data.
Reid's research shows there is a strong correlation between math anxiety and a teacher's knowledge of the subject. According to the most recent EQAO results, 82 per cent of elementary teachers completed post-secondary education in an area unrelated to mathematics.
“If you don't know how to add fractions or the concepts behind them, how do you expect to teach that?” Reid says.
Reid says she spends a lot of time going over mathematics with student teachers in order to address that issue.
In April 2016, Ontario announced a three-year, $60-million math strategy that puts an average of 60 minutes per day of “protected math learning time” in the curriculum for students between Grade 1 and Grade 8.
The following year, only half of students in Grade 6, and 62 per cent of those in Grade 3 met the provincial standard in math. The dismal results prompted Premier Kathleen Wynne to announce the province would look at overhauling its math education program.
READ MORE: Groups push for more emphasis on climate change in Alberta curriculum
In Quebec, students consistently perform the best in the country. Experts believe that is mostly due to stronger teachers who have to go to school for four years for a bachelor of education degree, and more math specialist teachers beginning in Grade 7.
But it's not just an issue for teachers, Reid says. Responsibility lies with every adult who deals with a child's education, she says.
Gina Iuliano Marrello, the superintendent of student success at the Toronto Catholic District School Board, agrees.
At a recent meeting, Marrello said the board asked what they could do to help.
“Try to be positive — all the adults, the trustees, the teachers, the parents — everyone can do it,” Marrello says she told the board.
“We hear people say all the time ‘Don't worry, I'm no good at math' — even adults say that and that has to stop. People never say ‘Don't worry, I was never good at reading.' People would think that's crazy.”
For Freedman, a young teacher just starting out, girls' confidence in math is of paramount importance.
“If girls want a job in science or architecture, for example, we have to encourage that confidence in math and find jobs to use those skills,” she says.”If we don't give them the opportunity to practice the skills or foster their enjoyment in architecture or whatever it may be, they're never going to make that choice if they're not confident in math.”
Pointe-Claire has expanded its dog run at Terra Cotta Park so people can let their pets run free.
The run is now 600 square metres longer.

The recent construction connects Maywood Avenue to the dog park, so more people can easily access the area.
The extension comes just after a judge ruled that the Angell Woods green space is off-limits to dog walkers because it's private land.

Pointe-Claire resident Peter Elder said he used to bring his dog, Archie, to Angell Woods on a regular basis, but will now go to Terra Cotta Park in the wake of the judge's ruling.
In a typical day, the dog park can welcome as many as 30 dogs and their owners, making it a popular meeting spot in Pointe-Claire.
The park's hours are 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday to Sunday.

I go through my day remembering things like telephone cords.
–Bruce Eric Kaplan
Bell demonstrates the new telephone connection between New York and Chicago in 1892.
Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray, both independently designed devices that could transmit speech electronically. Bell reached patent office mere hours before Gray. Thus he won the battle over invention of telephone as his patent was passed on March 7, 1876. The first official lines for telephone service were laid down between Boston and Somerville, Massachusetts by early 1877.
Telephone and the telecommunication underwent a revolution in the 1980s with the first testing of VoIP service, caller ID and the introduction of mobile phone. However, it was the 21st century innovations in the design of a phone that a telephone moved from a table or console to a man's palm and pocket. The innovation and technological advancement has made the traditional telephone almost an antique of the previous centuries. Smart phones are the new devices of communication with sophisticated pieces of software that are used for communication purposes.
Glossybox, a BirchBox clone launched by the Samwer brothers back in 2011 to deliver willing consumers a monthly subscription of beauty products, has been acquired by UK online retailer and ecommerce platform operator, The Hut Group (THG). Terms of the deal have not been disclosed.
Glossybox had raised $72 million from four investors over its six-year or so run, according to Crunchbase. Its majority shareholders were Rocket Internet and Kinnevik Online.
The number of beauty subscription boxes has grown in recent years, as more companies jumped on the product subscription bandwagon.
THG has several subscription box products of its own, such as its lookfantastic brand Beauty Box, although it also offers subscription box offerings beyond the beauty space, such as its MyGeekBox and PopInABox brands.
The company couches the Glossybox buy as a strategic move to further extend its international reach — with the latter active in 10 markets: the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden.
Glossybox has not disclosed subscription numbers recently, but THG reckons there's room to grow the brand by plugging it into its proprietary ecommerce platform-plus-marketing infrastructure.
THG, which operates more than 140 websites retailing premium, non-perishable FMCG products direct to consumers, claims “hundreds of millions” of users globally across its market footprint, shipping some 37 million items annually.
It also said it intends to invest in Glossybox's Berlin base — evolving it into a “tech-hub” for the Group.
Commenting on the acquisition in a statement, Matthew Moulding, founder and CEO of THG, said: “This is another significant investment for The Hut Group. In Glossybox, we have acquired a great brand, with a solid and engaged customer base that, once powered through our platform and marketing infrastructure, should be capable of further significant growth.”
While Caren Genthner-Kappesz, CEO of Glossybox, described THG as “the right strategic partner to drive our business forward”.
The press release doesn't mention the word ‘brexit' but a UK-based ecommerce player planning to invest in and beef up a tech hub that will be remaining within the European Union also looks like a nice hedge against potential skills shortages domestically. Hence THG lauding Berlin as “home to a highly tech-savvy community”.
2019 Jaguar I-Pace first drive Enlarge Photo
Jaguar product planning boss Hanno Kirner believes the instant torque and power found in a hypothetical I-Pace SVR could be too much for untrained drivers. While he stopped short of confirming a high-performance version of the electric crossover, he made it clear such a vehicle is on the table.
Kirner told Autocar in a Tuesday report that an I-Pace SVR would likely be capable of reaching 60 mph in 1.8 seconds, but engineers also want to prioritize handling—not just headline-grabbing specs.
"Once you've done it once or twice, and lost your eyes in the back of their sockets, you might not want to do it again," he said.
Tesla has already made plenty of headlines in recent years for offering hypercar levels of acceleration with the Model S and Model X electric cars. The 2020 Tesla Roadster will also allegedly reach 60 mph in 1.9 seconds.
The product planning chief envisioned some sort of power restriction for a potential I-Pace SVR. Kirner said the vehicle could reduce power for a driver until he/she has attended a driving course or some other instruction. Although Jaguar hasn't committed to such a model, the brand's top brass certainly do like to talk about the idea of one.
Last March, Kirner first expressed interest in building an I-Pace performance variant. At that time, he also said there remains a possibility for other I-Pace models, including an off-road or more luxurious version. Kirner echoed the sentiment in the latest Autocar report.
"There is probably more than one route we could take," he said. "But there is definitely space for a performance electric car or cars."
John Edwards, head of Jaguar Land Rover's personalization and performance arm, also hinted earlier this year that Jaguar will eventually develop a full range of performance-oriented electric cars.
The British luxury brand will also take the I-Pace racing in its own one-make series held before Formula E open-wheel electric-car races.

The Piper PA-46 veered off the left side of the runway in Akron, Ohio, during landing with a left gusting crosswind.
The maximum demonstrated crosswind velocity for the airplane was 17 knots.
The pilot said he applied right rudder and left aileron control inputs for the landing.
The left main landing gear touched down first and when the right main landing gear contacted the runway, a gust of wind lifted the left wing, resulting in a loss of directional control.
The airplane veered off the left side of the runway and into a grass area adjacent to the runway, where the nose landing gear collapsed.
The airplane sustained substantial damage to the engine firewall.
The pilot and passenger were uninjured.
Probable cause: The pilot's failure to maintain directional control during a crosswind landing in gusting crosswind conditions.

The Israel Railways electronic timetable at the Tel Aviv Savidor Station. (Tomer Neuberg/Flash90)
YERUSHALAYIM - The Histadrut has announced a “warning” strike of Egged bus service in Yerushalayim starting 5 a.m. and continuing all day Wednesday, The Jerusalem Post reported.
The national labor federation said it was calling the strike in response to the conduct of Egged's management toward its drivers, as well as the state's negligence in safeguarding the company as an important transportation asset in Israel.
“Egged is at the edge of an abyss,” declared Avi Nissenkorn, chairman of the Histadrut. “I regret that instead of strengthening the drivers who perform their jobs properly, they are doing the opposite.”
In addition, from late Wednesday through early Sunday morning, train travel in central Israel will be restricted due to infrastructure work.
A number of train stations will be affected to allow work to continue on both the high-speed train line from Tel Aviv to Yerushalayim and the Sharon train line.
“The new railway lines are a significant part of the Israel Railways development program and are expected to serve hundreds of thousands of new customers every day, reduce thousands of vehicles on the roads, decrease traffic congestion and improve air quality,” a statement from Israel Railways said.
The temporary closure will be felt at stops located between Beit Yehoshua and Tel Aviv University and Hod Hasharon and Tel Aviv University, including Tel Aviv University, Herzliyah, Hod Hasharon Sokolov, Kfar Saba-Nordau, Rosh Ha'ayin, Petach Tikvah Segulah, Petach Tikvah Kiryat Aryeh, and Bnei Brak.
The Transportation Ministry said it will provide free shuttles from the Beit Yehoshua station to the Herzliyah and Tel Aviv stations. Meanwhile, Israel Railways will be operating a free bus that stops at the stations between Netanyah and Ben-Gurion Airport, as well as bus service from Tel Aviv Savidor Central Station to Tel Aviv University, in both directions.

With director Peyton Reed's Ant-Man and the Wasp opening in theaters this weekend, I recently got to sit down with Michael Douglas (Hank Pym) to talk about the making of the sequel. During the quick interview, he talked about why he read the script more than once, what people would be surprised to learn about the making of an Ant-Man movie, what it means to be part of a franchise that brings the entire planet together, and how being part of the Marvel universe has opened the door to a new generation of fans.
As most of you know, Ant-Man and the Wasp finds Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) teaming up with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) to venture into the Quantum Realm and rescue Hope's mother Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer). Complications ensue when the antagonist Ghost (Hannah John-Komen) throws a wrench into their plans. Written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, Paul Rudd, Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari, the film also stars Michael Peña, Walton Goggins, Bobby Cannavale, Judy Greer, Tip “T.I.” Harris, David Dastmalchian, Abby Ryder-Fortson, Randall Park, and Laurence Fishburne.
Check out what Michael Douglas had to say in the player above and below is exactly what we talked about.
Michael Douglas
What was his reaction when he first read the script?
What would surprise people to learn about making an Ant-Man movie?
How being part of Ant-Man opened the door to a new generation of fans and good will around the world.
Here's the official synopsis for Ant-Man and the Wasp:
From the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes “Ant Man and the Wasp,” a new chapter featuring heroes with the astonishing ability to shrink. In the aftermath of “Captain America: Civil War,” Scott Lang grapples with the consequences of his choices as both a Super Hero and a father.

If Unique Bella comes back with a flourish on Sunday in the L.A. Woman Stakes at Santa Anita, she will be poised to join an elite group of racing greats who blew off most of the season only to emerge at the top of the heap in a Breeders' Cup race at the end of the year.
For starters there is Da Hoss, the patron saint of comebacks, the star of a story forever told 'round the Breeders' Cup campfire. Da Hoss, a 6-year-old gelding, had not had a serious run since winning the 1996 Breeders' Cup Mile at Woodbine. Infirmities had kept him sequestered at the eastern Maryland farm of trainer Michael Dickinson, where Da Hoss was able to train when he was healthy and rest when he was not. He rested a lot.
It was now November of 1998 at Churchill Downs. Da Hoss had only recently returned to competition, winning a minor event at Colonial Downs. Dickinson was convinced his horse was fit, and he knew Da Hoss had retained his considerable class. Still, the idea of a horse winning a deeply competitive race like the Mile with only one race in two years bordered on preposterous.

Arc winner Enable to skip Breeders' Cup Enable, the heroine of the 2017 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, might well race again next year at age 4, but barring a change in plans, she will not be racing again this year. 1 Related
When Da Hoss defeated the talented Hawksley Hill by a head, Dickinson was praised far and wide for pulling off the miracle. And though the trainer deflected credit to his horse, the media insisted on labeling him racing's "mad genius" for such an outlandish achievement.
"They've got it half-right," Dickinson would say with a laugh.
John Veitch's work getting Proud Truth ready to win the 1985 Breeders' Cup Classic was less a work of genius than a classic piece of old-school training, bringing a good horse back from a cannon bone fracture with fingers crossed that nothing would go amiss.
Proud Truth was good enough to win the Florida Derby in early '85 and later the Peter Pan, on May 26, during which he sustained the leg injury. Today he'd be done for the year, but Veitch had the colt back in August, backed off in September, and then used a sprint at Belmont in early October as a training tool to see where he was.
He was fine. Veitch put the finishing touch on Proud Truth one week before the Breeders' Cup Classic, running him in the nine-furlong Discovery Handicap on Oct. 26 at Aqueduct, where the Breeders' Cup would be run seven days later. He won the Discovery, then beat Gate Dancer by a head at the end of a Classic that also drew Turkoman, Vanlandingham, and Chief's Crown.
Ross Fenstermaker didn't bother with a prep race. Two and a half hours before the 1985 Classic was run, the trainer brought over his proven middle-distance star Precisionist to win the Breeders' Cup Sprint off a break in action of 132 days.
Precisionist was not out with an injury, but he certainly deserved the rest. Between the end of December 1984 and late June 1985, he had run eight times, winning major stakes at seven, eight, nine, and 10 furlongs along the way. Fenstermaker would insist that training his horse to win a six-furlong race first crack out of the box was not that big of a deal, no matter who he was running against.
But after he defeated a BC Sprint field that included Smile, Mt. Livermore, and Fighting Fit, it looked like a very big deal indeed. Eclipse Award voters agreed and made Precisionist their sprint champion.
Unique Bella developed a sore shin earlier this year after winning the Santa Ynez, Las Virgenes, and Santa Ysabel stakes at Santa Anita. The injury was far from career threatening, and may even have been career enhancing. There was always the impression that as robust as she looked, Unique Bella was running too hard and too fast for her own good. Now she has the look of a fully mature filly, ready for whatever the opposition can bring in the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Sprint on Nov. 4 at Del Mar, where she won a maiden race by nearly 11 lengths.
The L.A. Woman is a Grade 3, 6 1/2-furlong event named for a cut from a 1971 Doors album of the same name. Jim Morrison died in a Paris bathtub less than three months after its release.
Bill Spawr will be on the sidelines Sunday, watching Unique Bella's return with interest as he continues to train Great Lady M. Stakes winner Skye Diamonds for the Filly and Mare Sprint. Skye Diamonds had a work scheduled for Saturday as she continues a steady pattern toward the showdown.
"She was a little fuzzy when I got back," said Spawr, who returned to work from a 30-day suspension on Sept. 29, levied because of a post-race overage of an allowed medication in a urine sample taken from Skye Diamonds last spring.
"So we clipped her, and she's doing well," Spawr said. "She's been working at five-day intervals, easy works. I follow her back to the barn to see how she recovers, and she cools out right away, like she does when she gallops."
As for clocking the potential Breeders' Cup competition, Spawr isn't losing sleep.
"I'll leave that to John Lindo," Spawr said with a laugh, citing one of the partners in the Skye Diamond ownership. "I'll do my job and take care of the filly."

As federal agencies expand their investigation into the business practices of Wells Fargo & Company, the fines and penalties for the financial services institution, with $1.9 trillion in assets, continue to rise.
While many saw the news about the $1 billion fine against Wells Fargo, the real story was not in the amount of the fine, but rather who fined the bank and why.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) assessed a $500 million penalty against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. “and ordered the bank to make restitution to customers harmed by its unsafe or unsound practices and develop and implement an effective enterprise-wide compliance risk management program,” according to a press release about the fine.
The press release continued: “The OCC's action was closely coordinated with an action by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which through a separate and collaborative approach assessed a $1 billion penalty against the bank and credited the amount collected by the OCC toward the satisfaction of its fine.”
The press release said that, “The OCC took these actions given the severity of the deficiencies and violations of law, the financial harm to consumers, and the bank's failure to correct the deficiencies and violations in a timely manner.”
The OCC found that the bank had violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act.
The OCC also reported that Wells Fargo, “engaged in unsafe and unsound practices relating to improper placement and maintenance of collateral protection insurance policies on auto loan accounts and improper fees associated with interest rate lock extensions,” the press release said. “The OCC penalty will be paid to the U.S. Treasury.”
The order also modifies restrictions placed on the bank in November 2016 relating to the approval of severance payments to employees and the appointment of senior executive officers or board members, the press release said.
The press release continued: “The original restrictions related to severance payments applied to all employees, which unnecessarily delayed severance payments to employees who were not responsible for the bank's deficiencies or violations.”

The firing of Uli Stielike as the South Korea men's football head coach Thursday completed a rather precipitous fall from grace for a man once hailed as "god."
The Korea Football Association made the decision in its technical committee meeting, held barely two days after South Korea lost to Qatar 3-2 in Doha in the final Asian qualification round for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
Uli Stielike, former head coach of the South Korean men's football team, listens to a reporter's question at Incheon International Airport on June 14, 2017, after arriving from a 3-2 loss to Qatar in a World Cup qualifying match in Doha. (Yonhap)
Stielike, who took over the team in September 2014, was the longest-tenured head coach in the men's national team history. He leaves with a record of 27 wins, five draws and seven losses. South Korea scored 63 goals -- not counting opponents' own goals -- and allowed 25.After dropping the latest match, South Korea remained stuck at 13 points with four wins, a draw and three losses to stay in second place in Group A. They're barely holding on to the final automatic qualification spot, with Uzbekistan right behind them at 12 points.Iran have already secured their spot with 20 points. The top two teams from Groups A and B will advance directly to the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Two third-place teams must go through a playoff for their final chance.South Korea, chasing their ninth consecutive World Cup appearance, will host Iran on Aug. 31 and face Uzbekistan in Tashkent on Sept. 5 to close out the qualifying stage.In the current qualification stage, South Korea have yet to win a match away from home, with a draw and three losses. The two goals that South Korea scored against Qatar were the first two for the team on the road.Stielike guided the country to a runner-up finish at the 2015 Asian Football Confederation Asian Cup. South Korea had a perfect record in the second round of the World Cup qualification from June 2015 to March 2016, reeling off eight wins while scoring 27 goals and giving up none.In 2015, South Korea lost just once while picking up 16 wins and three draws, and giving up just three goals all year.During that run of success, Stielike was hailed by fans as "God-tielike," but the same fans that so revered him have turned their backs on him over some lethargic efforts of late.The call for Stielike's head further intensified after South Korea fell to China 1-0 on the road and eked out a 1-0 win over Syria at home in March.The KFA defied the mounting pressure and entrusted Stielike with the rest of the qualification stage, at least, saying it couldn't find a suitable replacement this deep into the tournament.The KFA instead appointed veteran coach Jung Hae-sung as Stielike's new assistant, hoping to narrow the apparent chasm that existed between the players and their head coach.Against Qatar, though, South Korea submitted yet another dreadful defensive game. The players were often caught ball-watching and were sloppy with the ball in their own zone.Despite the two goals scored -- the team's biggest output in an away match in this qualifying round -- South Korea remained winless in four road contests, with one draw and three losses.The writing was already on the wall by the time Stielike and his team landed home Wednesday evening. Stielike told reporters at Incheon International Airport that he would willingly take the fall for the poor performance and would accept whatever decision the KFA reached, though he fell short of announcing his resignation on the spot.Moments later, Lee Yong-soo, who resigned Thursday as the KFA's technical director, said he felt it was "time for a change." It was Lee who hired Stielike in 2014. (Yonhap)
Earlier this week, the Washington Capitals finished off the Columbus Blue Jackets in Game 6, setting up a second-round series with a familiar foe. The Pittsburgh Penguins await in Round 2, having dispatched the Philadelphia Flyers, also in Game 6.
This sets up a series hockey fans are pretty acclimated to by now. For the third consecutive year, it'll be the Pens versus the Caps in a playoff series. Both teams deserve to be there — no one gets to and then through the NHL playoffs because of sheer luck — but we can't help but wonder whether or not another round of Sidney Crosby versus Alex Ovechkin is actually good for the sport itself.
Will it be fun? Probably, but that doesn't mean this semifinal doesn't have a handful of pros and cons in play.
Pro: Crosby vs Ovechkin Is an Easy Sell to Casual Fans
Let's face it: casual NHL fans aren't plugged in from the first day of training camp all the way through to the Stanley Cup Final, especially if their team isn't involved. The playoffs bring the sport's more cursory supporters out of the woodwork, which means that broadcast partners need a quick and punchy way to get them to tune into broadcasts once every 48 hours or so (give or take).
It doesn't get much more quick and punchy than Ovechkin vs Crosby. They've been sharing headlines and arenas since they were teenagers — well, “The Great Eight” technically debuted as a 20-year-old, but you get the point.
Capitals knock out the Blue Jackets. Sets up Washington vs. Pittsburgh. Ovechkin vs. Crosby again. pic.twitter.com/dr24EVp1Yd — Brad Galli (@BradGalli) April 24, 2018
The game has plenty of rising stars, but No. 8 and No. 87 are the two players who saw us out of the darkness of the 2005 lockout and reminded us of why we love hockey in the first place. Both men know how to put on a show, and whenever they square off, it leads to emotional and skill-driven play.
What's not to like?
Con: It's Not Just Crosby vs Ovechkin Anymore
Oh, right. The idea that this is just Crosby against Ovechkin is both antiquated and obnoxious. It's what the talking heads on NBCSN will ram down our throats during each and every intermission and in advertisements, but if the Penguins and Capitals were driven by just Crosby and Ovechkin, then they wouldn't be in the second round.
Washington and Pittsburgh both roster some of the most exciting or interesting players in the league – from Phil Kessel and Matt Murray to John Carlson and Braden Holtby, both squads are chock full of quality skaters. We probably shouldn't leave out Evgeni Malkin and the perpetually underappreciated Nicklas Backstrom, either.
Despite all this talent, all anyone is going to want to talk about is the two captains, which is a bummer because these are two outstanding teams with more to offer than Crosby and Ovechkin.
Pro: Penguins & Capitals Have a Baked-In Rivalry
The NHL loves trying to make us believe that the two teams skating against each other on our televisions are rivals. We're more than four years into the whole Wednesday Night Rivalry schtick, but most of the time, the thought of the two squads involved actually disliking each other is worth an eye roll at best.
Pittsburgh versus the Anaheim Ducks sold as a rivalry game? C'mon.
Related: Penguins Prove They Aren't Tired Of Winning Yet
The league doesn't have to worry about putting the Penguins and Capitals over as a potentially heated encounter, though, because there's plenty of recent history in place. It's the third consecutive time these two teams will meet in the playoffs and we have the wonderful story of the generation's most electric goal scorer trying to finally get to the Eastern Conference Final for the first time in his otherwise illustrious career.
To get there, he'll have to take down Crosby; a player who has gotten the better of him at every turn since they entered the league together 13 years ago. Who doesn't want to see that, even if it's the third consecutive season in which it has happened?
Con: Is it Special if it Happens Every Year?
Let's say your favorite meal on the face of the planet is filet mignon; maybe with a side of roasted duck potatoes and a pleasant pinot noir from Tuscany to wash it all down with.
It's the meal you get on your birthday. Maybe the occasional night out on the town when you're celebrating a wayward friend coming home or a hard-earned promotion.
Over the next 10 years, you know it's something you'll maybe be able to eat 11 or 12 times total. That's part of what makes ordering the meal special, right? The food itself isn't particularly scarce, but the experience is. You know things have to line up just right for that filet mignon to land on your plate, so you savor each and every bite when it's in front of you.
Wouldn't it become less memorable if you were able to consume it, say, once a week? Suddenly it's a part of your routine and not this extraordinary thing you get to look forward to at only the most special times in your life.
That's the intriguing question that will linger over this series as it unfolds. How many tricks do Ovechkin and Crosby have left up their sleeves? How many turns can we take before we've seen it all before? Is it a party if it happens every night?
Pro: They Represent the Best of this Generation
Maybe you're sick of the Penguins and Capitals and you were angered by the emergence of this trilogy. Plenty of folks on Twitter seemed to fall into this camp as Washington shook hands with the Blue Jackets on Monday night. Maybe you're on the other side and you are as amped for it as Alex Ovechkin himself claims to be.
The fact remains that Crosby is 30. Ovechkin is 32. We're only going to get a few more opportunities to watch these two titans clash on the grandest of stages. They're both locked in the Eastern Conference, so we'll probably never get a Stanley Cup Final between the two. This is the closest we'll get to see that unfold.
Is it repetitive for those who live and breathe the game? Perhaps on paper, but if you love hockey then why wouldn't you want to see the best two players of this generation square off as often as possible? The postseason isn't rigged — both Pittsburgh and Washington deserve to be where they are.
All we can do now is sit back, enjoy the ride and appreciate it while it lasts. Who knows if this will be the final time we see Crosby face Ovechkin in the playoffs? Then, 10 years from now, with the benefit of hindsight, we'll talk about that classic trio of series and how it brought the best out of the transcendent players of our time.
LAHORE - The Monday's tragic incident of suicide blast in which 14 people lost their lives and about a hundred were injured has left the people of Lahore in shock.
The officially announced day of mourning reflected the deep sorrow of people. All the major markets of the city remained closed while the attendance at private and public sector offices was also thin. There was little traffic on the roads and commercial areas especially gave a deserted look.
The attendance at private schools hit a low followed by confusion prevailing among parents. Parents however cleared the confusion upon reaching the schools. Most schools were open but many public sector schools as well as private sector schools remained closed.
The Beaconhouse, LGS and many other schools were open while missionary schools like Cathedral Schools, St Anthony's School, Sacred Heart and Convent of Jesus and Mary were closed. Public sector schools like Queen Mary College that had received terror threats in the past were closed.
The terrible tragedy remained talk of the town among Lahoris who have always shown resolute to the unweaving events. City's traditional food spots and eateries like the Food Street on Fort Road had very few customers. Some had closed shop considering there would be not much clientele.
Majority of citizens preferred staying in their houses as the city remained under security threat. People preferred not to travel.
Very thin attendance was observed in the government offices. National flag kept flying at half mast on all the government and private buildings. Security was beefed up at the schools, colleges and universities to avoid any untoward incident.
Major markets including Liberty Market, Mall Road, Abid Market, Anarkali Bazaar, Ichra, Brandreth Road Market, Fortress Stadium market, Hall Road and Walled City's commercial markets remained closed.
In the wake of tragic incident, all the cultural actives were suspended at Lahore Arts Council and Alhamra Cultural Complex. A play ‘Shehr-e-Afsoos' by Ajoka Theatre was also cancelled. The play will be staged on today.
The usual hustle and bustle was missing on Valentine's Day, a day of love, which is marked every year on February 14. Many flower shops looked deserted and little activity was seen. The city's parks including Racecourse Park, Bagh-e-Jinnah, Jallo Park, Model Town Park and Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park presented a deserted look. Families preferred to remain in their houses.
Lahore Fort, Badshahi Mosque and other heritage sites which have always been the epicentre for the visitors from city and nearby towns and villages also presented a deserted look. People who had planned to come to Lahore for recreation postponed their plans.
Representatives of civil society organisations including Peace for Life lit candles in the memory of the victims of the Faisal Chowk blast.
The Lahore Press Club observed black day and national flag was half mist and all the activities were cancelled. A candle vigil was also organised in memory of departed souls of Lahore blast.
The LPC office bearers urged the government to implement complete ban on holding of protests at The Mall and outside the press club.
Noshina Ahmed, mother of two children, resident of Samanabad Town, was of the view that after the terror attack, she became more vigilant to have an eye on her children. “We have not yet forgotten the massacre at Army Public School Peshawar, and other countless terror incidents. The blast outside Punjab Assembly is felt in our hearts,” she told The Nation.
Ali Rana, student of public university, resident of Wahdat Colony, said that the blast tragedy saddened him. “The terrorists tried to lower the morale of lively people of Lahore but we are ready to retaliate with our passion for country,” he said.
Fatima Munir from University of Central Punjab termed the incident ‘extremely tragic'. “Sons of soil were snatched away from their mothers. The semester has already ended but we can feel a sense of fear in the city while traveling to our university,” she added.

A former Vice Chancellor of the University of Ghana, Professor Ivan Addae-Mensah
Professor Ivan Addae-Mensah, a former Vice Chancellor of the University of Ghana, has called for a critical look at the funding of the Free Senior High School (SHS) Policy to ensure its sustainability.
He said providing quality and equitable education entailed a lot of cost, probably more cost than the cost of increasing access.
“You can increase access by making the financial burden of education on the individual less burdensome, and providing infrastructure but quality can only be improved if the conditions under which educators work are made more attractive,” he said.
Prof Addae-Mensah said this on Monday at the launch of the Global Action Week for Education 2018.
The Week, which is being organised by the Ghana National Education Campaign Coalition (GNECC), is on the theme: “Strengthening Citizen Participation and Accountability in Education Management: A Milestone for Achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Four”.
He said pupil to teacher ratio, especially at many of the public schools, was poor and had to be addressed.
“We have recently introduced the Free SHS system, this is perhaps one of the boldest educational reforms decisions taken in this country since independence,” he said.
“Now we have a situation in which whether a person can afford to pay for his or her education, it is provided free of charge. This has its implications on quality and equity,” he said.
Prof Addae-Mensah said experience over the years since 1951 had shown that whenever governments took on direct financing of education without any or very little contribution from parents, quality suffers because governments were unable to meet their obligations in good time, if at all, and sustain the necessary financial outlays required.
He said those aspects of the implications of the Fee SHS would need to be critically and dispassionately looked at without political colouration, so that the scheme could become permanent and sustainable.
He noted that the present experiment would only succeed if government would be able and willing to provide the necessary financial administrative and personnel support for the scheme.
Prof. Addae-Mensah said the Government should not put unnecessary restrictions on parents who were able, willing and prepared to contribute to their children's education in the public schools through their Parent Teacher Associations.
He said the whole issue of funding education in general and pre-tertiary education in particular would need to be re-examined.
Prof. Addae-Mensah cited a 2010 Report on Sustainable Funding of Education from Pre-school to Tertiary Level, produced by the National Council for Tertiary Education at great cost.
He disclosed that he was the co-chair of that Committee, adding “My other co-chairman of that Committee was well known Prof Jophus Anamoah-Mensah,” he said.
“It was a very comprehensive and far reaching report, unfortunately, immediately Professor John Evans Atta-Mills, who commissioned the report left office the succeeding government simply ignored it and was never implemented,” Prof Addae-Mensah said.
“I will strongly suggest that the present government revisit that report seeing if it can glean from it some ideas for providing for sustainable quality education beyond just the mere facilitation of access,” he said.
Dr Esther Ofei-Aboagye, a former Director of the Institute of Local Government Studies, who chaired the function, urged the Government to ensure that the councils and governing boards for colleges of education were constituted.

KHANEWAL - Three men burnt alive in a fire that had broken out in a general store in Main Bazaar of Kabirwala, engulfing two nearby shops here the other day.
According to locals, the fire was overcome after hectic struggle of four hours by Rescue 1122. They said that the flames of fire were too high to control due to stock of fireworks stored in the shops. The fire reduced three shops to ashes including the valuables worth millions of rupees. The store owner told The Nation that seven persons were working in the shop when the fire erupted. Rescue 1122 teams reached the spot and brought the fire under control. The rescue teams recovered three bodies from the wreckage of the shops and search for other five was underway. Three deceased included Iqbal, Ghulam Qadir Puno and one more person whose identity could not be ascertained. They were employees in the shop. A rescue firefighter Aneel and other three were seriously injured in the incident.
Residents of the area appealed to the high-ups take notice of the incident and order action against those selling fireworks. They also flayed Khanewal police for their failure to control the sale of fireworks in the district.
Professor Isaac Adewole, the minister of health, has said the federal government has begun free healthcare services to Nigerians living with certain medical conditions that require major surgeries, but are unable to seek healthcare services due to the cost.
Speaking during a media interactive session on Thursday, December 29, at the just concluded Kuchigoro Primary Healthcare Centre, Abuja, Adewole directed Nigerians who need healthcare services to visit any Federal Teaching Hospital or medical centre for free treatment.
The directive was given in line with the operations of the Rapid Response Initiative (RRI) which was inaugurated to perform not less than 10,000 free surgeries on poor Nigerians.
The Health Minister said the only qualification to have is that the patient must be poor, And the government will do those surgeries that really put people in discomfort.
He listed a few medical cases that required surgeries such as myomectomy cleft lips, and even VVF, He said many of these are being handled in 46 specialist centers across the country.
Conducting a tour round the Kuchigoro health facility, Adewole disclosed that about N550 million had been earmarked for the revitalization of the first phase of primary health care centres.
The minister added that the project was important to the federal government as it strives to tackle maternal and child mortality in the country.
Launched in 2015 by Imran Khan, Chairman of Pakistan's Tehreek-e-Insaf party, the Billion Tree Tsunami aims to turn the tide on land degradation and loss in the mountainous, formerly forested KPK province in the Hindu Kush mountain range. The campaign simultaneously helped KPK province fulfil its 348,400 hectare commitment to the Bonn Challenge – a global effortto bring 150 million hectares of deforested and degraded land into restoration by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. This marks the first Bonn Challenge pledge to reach its restoration goal, according to International Union for Conservative Nature's latest report.
“The project is naturally restoring a previously deforested landscape, which will assist in meeting present and future needs and offers multiple benefits for climate adaptation and mitigation in a very climate-vulnerable province,” says Muhammad Tehmasip, Project Director of the Billion Tree Tsunami.
The project has achieved its restoration target through a combination of protected natural regeneration (60%) and planned afforestation (40%). In addition, it has established 13,000 private tree nurseries, which have already boosted local incomes, generated thousands of green jobs, and empowered unemployed youth and women in the province.
“IUCN congratulates the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on reaching this momentous milestone. The Billion Tree Tsunami initiative is a true conservation success story, one that further demonstrates Pakistan's leadership role in the international restoration effort and continued commitment to the Bonn Challenge,” says Inger Anderson, Director General of IUCN.
The planted trees are reinforcing riparian embankments in important catchment areas, including along the banks of the Indus, Kunhar and Swat rivers. The project has also added tree resources to agricultural lands currently engaged in farm forestry, improved biodiversity by restoring wildlife shelters, and will contribute to CO₂ sequestration through new tree plantations.
In support of the Billion Tree Tsunami, the KPK government invested US$ 123 million in funding and will allocate an additional US$ 100 million to maintain the project through June 2020. This support makes the project one of the largest eco-investments ever made in Pakistan.
Restoration is also gaining important national support. In 2016, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced the Green Pakistan Programme, with a goal to plant over 100 million trees in the country. Additionally, Pakistan made a national pledge to the Bonn Challenge in May 2017 to complement the existing KPK commitment – pledging 100,000 hectares during the first Asia Bonn Challenge High-level Roundtable in South Sumatra, and helping the Bonn Challenge cross the 150 million hectare milestones.

The 31st amendment of Pakistan constitution finally bought the border areas into the mainstream political and legal structures of Pakistan. The five million people of the area with an estimated 2.5 million women population in it have experienced the most traumatic and anxiety-ridden times during the past two decades and continues to do so because of many complex reasons. Unchecked militarization, war, bombing and displacement have not left any inhabitant not affected by the conflict.
FATA remains one of the poorest regions in the country partly because of a corrupt colonial system but also due to the conflict While there is no denying the fact that when an area is hit by years of conflict, there is no doubt that every person's life in that area is, in one way or another, changed forever. Whether it is the man who lost a limb in a bomb blast or landmine, the woman whose husband was killed by Taliban or the child who lost his parents in a surprise attack on his village. The aftermath of a conflict is often just as traumatic, if not more so than the conflict itself. The after-effects can be extremely severe, leaving thousands of people homeless, in extreme poverty, terribly ill, and with acute post-traumatic psychological disorders.
However, any armed conflict affects women and children overwhelmingly as they are the soft targets for attacks, similarly two decades of militancy and war has taken a terrible toll on women and children of fata, for which they are not largely responsible no matter whoever one blames for the conflict.
While FATA women have been disproportionately affected by the war, they have been kept out of all efforts for peace and reforms dialogue, systematically discriminated by the patriarchal culture and all the powerful men in legal, religious and state institutions. They have been made invisible in the conflict reported only as victims giving birth in makeshift camps for displaced people or tending to young ill children in media images. The state has made a complete disregard for their activities, struggles and suffering during the conflict. They have been completely overlooked into the 31 amendment with no special provisions required for a region which has gone through most challenging times recently in Pakistan.
The state has failed to understand their miseries. The media only provided information post-Zarb Azab military operation that described the tough conditions women endure to survive the conflict yet, they constantly ignored the actions women took as principal actors and survivors and what needed to be done to alleviate their suffering.
Although 31 amendment offers the long-term political rehabilitation of FATA as a region but offers no priorities for short-term immediate relief a war-scarred area requires.
The necessary financial resource explicitly needed to help women left destitute and vulnerable because of the conflict. The state has not taken into stock that existing inequalities are magnified by the war, and with broken social networks their miseries have only increased.
The amendment offers no special provisions for the women of FATA. No relief is given to sole women bread earners, no shelter homes for women and girls with no families' left or legal help to those women who lost their men in war, and their land and property ultimately taken over by someone else. With abysmal Health facilities no emergency clause was introduced to help the vulnerable nor any vocational training center offered to help the lowest poverty stricken bracket of women. The poor economic condition underlined by conflict along with the traditional structures not offering much space, there could be no lasting success without women participation in rebuilding the region.
With a vacuum of legal, social and state structure, the women are the most hopeless victims of this conflict. The contributions and leadership of women, both in traditional and contemporary settings, are critical to ensuring meaningful and sustainable peace and for that special needs of women and girls during repatriation and resettlement needs to be met on a priority basis which 31 amendment failed to provide immediately.

Two Canadians among 18 people killed in Burkina Faso extremist attack
UPDATE: 9:20 a.m.
Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says two Canadians were among 18 people killed in a suspected extremist attack on a popular restaurant in Burkina Faso.
The incident happened late Sunday when suspected Islamic extremists opened fire at a Turkish restaurant in the country's capital.
Freeland says “the heartfelt condolences of our government go out to the loved ones of those targeted and the victims of this tragic attack.”
She says Canadian consular officials are working hard to provide assistance to the families of the victims.
Local authorities say other foreigners killed include two Kuwaitis and one person each from France, Senegal, Nigeria, Lebanon and Turkey.
Seven Burkina Faso citizens were also killed and authorities said three other victims had not yet been identified.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the violence, which continued into the early hours Monday.
The attack brought back painful memories of the January 2016 attack at another cafe that left 30 people dead.
Burkina Faso, a landlocked nation in West Africa, is one of the poorest countries in the world. It shares a northern border with Mali, which has long battled Islamic extremists.
More coming.

Gunfire could be heard almost seven hours after the attack began.
Global Affairs Canada said it was reaching out to Canadian citizens in the area and was ready to provide consular assistance as required.
“Canada strongly condemns the attack,” said spokeswoman Brittany Venhola-Fletcher. “Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with those affected by the terror attacks in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.”

The Southeastern Conference, for league games only, has expanded the use of replay review and implemented a new experimental challenge system for head coaches.
New types of plays that can be reviewed: force or tag plays, calls involving whether a base runner passes a preceding runner before such runner is out, hit-by-pitch calls, tag-up plays, placement of runners when the umpire's placement of runners following a boundary call, and interference for the purpose of breaking up a double play.
The umpire crew chief may initiate review of these six calls with a head coach's challenge at any time during a game or at the crew chief's discretion beginning with the eighth inning, or sixth inning in a designated seven-inning game.
Six permanent reviewable calls will remain in effect for all conference and nonconference games. Those are fair or foul calls, home runs, catch plays in the outfield or foul territory, certain catch plays in the infield, spectator interference and scoring plays at home plate.
The crew chief can initiate review of those six calls at any time.
Under the head coach challenge rule, a coach is limited to two challenges per conference game.
3 MORE NO-HITTERS
This season's Division I no-hitter total is up to 13 after three more last week.
Southern California freshman Kyle Hurt combined with Austin Manning and Connor Lunn for the Trojans' first nine-inning no-hitter since 1986 in a 2-0 win over Utah on Thursday.
Shane McClanahan and Carson Ragsdale combined for South Florida's first no-hitter since 2010 in a 12-0 win over Army on Friday. Texas Southern's Michael Villanueva threw a seven-inning no-hitter in a 10-0 win over Prairie View A&M on Saturday.
TOUGH PATCH FOR FROGS
TCU (10-7), which has reached the College World Series four straight years, has lost four of its last five games for its roughest stretch in five years. The Horned Frogs have hit .192 over the stretch, and nine of the 32 runs against them have been unearned. They open Big 12 play this weekend at home against Kansas State.
RUN OF THREE-BAGGERS
Wofford had a national season-high five triples in a 12-6 win over Siena on Saturday. The Terriers had a triple in the fourth inning, one in the fifth, two in the sixth and one in the seventh. The triples led to eight of the 12 runs.

A man was killed after jumping out of a cube van on Langelier Boulevard at Marie-Victorin Street in Pointe-aux-Trembles early Tuesday morning.
Police say the van was involved in an incident with Montreal police.
The driver of the cube van was apprehended on Highway 25 near Highway 640, and taken into custody.
Quebec's Bureau of independent investigations (BEI) has taken over the investigation of the incident.
“An investigation was transferred to the BEI following an event involving the SPVM in the Montreal North borough,” said Montreal police spokesperson Jean-Pierre Brabant.

The BEI announced via Twitter that information would be made available around 8:30 a.m.
Brabant said, “Langelier Boulevard is closed for the next few hours between Beaucourt Street and Henri-Bourassa as the BEI investigates the scene.”

After a whirlwind morning, ABC announced it is canceling the “Roseanne” revival following Roseanne Barr's offensive comments about one of Barack Obama's former senior advisers on Tuesday. Throughout the day, numerous Hollywood stars have taken to Twitter to react to her initial comments, and later, to celebrate the show's end.
“Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show,” ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said in a statement, in response to Barr calling former White House aide Valerie Jarrett the offspring of the “Muslim Brotherhood & Planet of the Apes.” Jarrett, a black woman, was born in Iran to American parents. When the comment was pointed out as being racist, Barr replied, “Muslims r NOT a race.” She then tweeted that she was “truly sorry for making a bad joke” and announced she was leaving Twitter.
In the wake of the backlash, Wanda Sykes, a consulting producer on “Roseanne,” said she would not be returning to the second season of the ABC show. Following the cancellation, executive producer Tom Werner issued a statement saying, “I support ABC's decision to cancel the show in the wake of Roseanne Barr's most recent reprehensible tweets. Our goal was to promote constructive discussion about the issues that divide us. It represented the work of hundreds of talented people. I hope the good work done is not totally eclipsed by these abhorrent and offensive comments, and that Roseanne seeks the help she so clearly needs.”

After news of the cancellation, celebrities including Ava DuVernay came out in support of the network's decision, who posted a photo of Dungey with the caption, “sitting on top of your world like a Queen in full judgement of your garbage and taking it out.” Similarly, Shonda Rhimes, who had several shows on ABC (but recently signed a deal with Netflix), tweeted “Thank you, Channing. #justice.” Later, Rhimes added, “But honestly she got what she deserved. As I tell my 4 year old, one makes a choice with one's actions. Roseanne made a choice. A racist one. ABC made a choice. A human one.”
Kumail Nanjiani wrote that he is “glad Roseanne is cancelled. The backlash to its cancellation is going to be a deafening nightmare. Nothing good has come out of this entire thing.”

Others, like “Scandal” star Josh Malina, took a more humorous approach, tweeting “ABC > GOP,” while others, like Mark Hamill and “The Ellen Show” producer Andy Lassner, joked that Fox would soon be picking up the show, as it recently renewed Tim Allen's “Last Man Standing” a year after ABC canceled the sitcom.

Before ABC announced the show's end, some in Hollywood were already calling for the network to take action. “Will & Grace” star Debra Messing tweeted, “@DisneyStudios FIRED an African American sports commentator for a comment (that wasn't even close to roseanne's). @therealroseanne should be fired if @DisneyStudios is going to have integrity.”
“Twin Peaks” co-creator Mark Frost, Reverend Al Sharpton, and actor Wilson Cruz also joined in on the conversation, with Cruz writing, “@ABCNetwork can NOT be the home of @blackishabc and #roseanne. You are better than this.”

Others joined in on the criticisms about her initial comments, including Patricia Arquette, Don Cheadle, Tom Arnold, and Ben Platt. Sara Gilbert, Barr's co-star and an executive producer on the show, tweeted shortly before its cancellation, “Roseanne's recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least.”

BENGALURU - Gold edged down from two-month highs on Monday, as the dollar inched up from last week's lows and investors kept a close watch on any developments on tensions over the Korean peninsula.
Spot gold was down 0.1 percent $1,287.60 per ounce at 0359 GMT, after marking its highest since June 7 at $1,291.86 an ounce in the previous session. US gold futures for December delivery were little changed at $1,293.8 per ounce.
"Maybe geopolitical tensions are easing so it's natural for gold to come down a bit ...But it's very unpredictable because prices could rise to another high because of some change," said Richard Xu, a fund manager at China's biggest gold exchange-traded fund, HuaAn Gold.
"After the sharp sell off in the dollar, over the weekend nothing happened so I guess the threat from the (Korean) peninsula is low, but we think gold fundamentals are strong," Xu said.
The dollar on Monday edged higher against the yen, trading above last week's near four-month low, with rising tensions between the United States and North Korea seen as the key to the near-term outlook. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was almost unchanged at 93.109.
President Donald Trump issued a new threat to North Korea on Friday, saying the U.S. military was "locked and loaded" as Pyongyang accused him of driving the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war and world powers expressed alarm.
Geopolitical risks can boost demand for assets considered safe-haven investments, such as gold.
"Although more aggressive rhetoric between the U.S. and North officials would temporarily boost gold prices, we see outright military action as unlikely and upward pressure on gold prices stemming from the confrontation as limited," analysts at BMI research said in a note.
Meanwhile, a lower-than-expected rise in U.S. consumer prices in July suggesting benign inflation could persuade a cautious Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until December.
Spot gold faces a strong resistance at $1,291 per ounce, it may hover below this level or retrace to a support at $1,278, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.
Among other precious metals, silver was up 0.3 percent at $17.12 per ounce, after hitting its highest since June 14 at $17.24 an ounce last week.
Platinum fell 0.1 percent to $978.95 per ounce and palladium was down 0.1 percent at $891.65 per ounce.
WINNIPEG — Free agent linebackers Khalil Bass and Tony Burnett have left the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for new teams.
Bass landed with the Ottawa RedBlacks after not receiving a new offer from the Bombers.
The 26-year-old American had nine sacks, three interceptions, five forced fumbles and 185 tackles in 35 games during two seasons in Winnipeg. He also scored two touchdowns.
Burnett meanwhile has signed with the BC Lions after two years with the Bombers. He recorded a sack, two forced fumbles and 56 tackles in 25 games during that span.
Eleven Bombers became free agents on Tuesday morning.
It's tough to keep a secret in the Canadian Football League (CFL).
The Calgary Stampeders and the Edmonton Eskimos were the only two teams that made bids on the 2018 Grey Cup. When it was officially awarded to Edmonton and Commonwealth Stadium last year, the rumours started immediately: Calgary would host the game in 2019.
During CFL week in Winnipeg last month, those rumours hit an all-time high as it was all but confirmed that McMahon Stadium would host the game for the first time since 2009.
CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie told the media to “stay tuned” as an official announcement would come in a couple of weeks.

On Wednesday at Shaw Court in Calgary, an official announcement will take place at 11 a.m. You can listen to it live on the home of the Calgary Stampeders, 770 CHQR, and watch the announcement live right here in this post.
Why Calgary? Basically, it's our turn.
In the last 30 years, the league has done a very good job of moving the championship around to team cities. Calgary first hosted the game in 1975 but had to wait until 1993 for another opportunity. This will be the 5th time the Stampeders have hosted the Grey Cup, as we also partied hard in 2000 and 2009.
But McMahon Stadium is the oldest building in the league and is the laughing stock in the CFL! Obviously, the Stampeders would love to host this game in a new stadium, but that's another topic for another day.
Regina hosted in 2013 and Mosiac Stadium wasn't exactly the Taj Mahal. McMahon will have no issues expanding capacity to 46,000.
READ MORE: Edmonton officially named 2018 Grey Cup host city
Why not Hamilton? The Tiger-Cats are in a legal battle over the construction of Tim Hortons Field. Owner Bob Young has said his team won't host the Grey Cup or CFL week until those legal issues are resolved.
The biggest question heading into 2019 is: “Will the Calgary Stampeders still be a contender?” They will be if Bo Levi Mitchell is still the starting quarterback. Let's not forget, he is heading into the final year of his contract and the rumours persist that he will want to take a shot at the NFL.
Did I mention, it's tough to keep a secret in the CFL.
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British and European Union negotiators will spend all next week in talks on Brexit, culminating in their first formal discussion of what their future relationship will look like after Britain has left the EU.
A schedule posted by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Twitter on Friday confirmed he will meet his opposite number, Brexit Secretary David Davis, in London on Monday for the first time since EU leaders gave him instructions to agree a post-Brexit transition to ease Britain's departure.
After interim accords in December on key parts of the divorce terms, EU leaders agreed to launch talks on the transition and the future relationship.
EU officials expect a faster pace to negotiations compared to the roughly monthly rounds of talks lasting 2-3 days each time that was the norm last year. Both sides hope to conclude a deal on a transition in time for EU leaders to endorse it at a Brussels summit on March 22-23.
Though not legally binding unless and until it forms part of an overall withdrawal treaty, leaders hope a transition deal can calm nerves among investors.
Negotiating teams will hold the first technical talks in Brussels from Tuesday to Thursday on what a transition may look like, notably which courts might enforce the treaty and further discussions on avoiding a disruptive “hard” border with Ireland.
On Friday, Barnier and Davis's top officials, Sabine Weyand and Oliver Robbins, will meet in Brussels to wrap up progress made during the week.
The British side will also offer an “update on the future relationship”, according to Barnier.
A British official said they would not reveal details of trade proposals; Prime Minister Theresa May has caused some frustration in Brussels by failing to do that so far, although she is expected to lay out her trade ideas in the coming weeks.
Rather, the British official said, Friday's session would focus on areas where London has already declared its preferred outcomes, such as a close relationship in security matters and a “customs partnership”.
TRANSITION DEAL
Declared positions on both sides suggest little room for dispute, although May has rejected an EU demand that EU citizens who take up residence in Britain even after Brexit, but before the end of the transition, should enjoy the same lifetime rights which London agreed to grant to those who arrive before Brexit.
That has raised the prospect of delay, but May insisted on Friday that the transition deal would be done within seven weeks -- in time for the March EU summit.
The EU has offered Britain a status quo transition until the end of 2020 after Brexit. But there is disagreement inside May's Conservative Party over the citizens' rights issue and the scope of European Court of Justice jurisdiction during the transition.
Of more concern to some in Brussels is the continued lack of clarity on how Britain sees a free trade deal working.
EU leaders want to be able to agree instructions for their negotiators when they meet on March 22-23 so that trade talks can start in the weeks after that. But once May has revealed her demands it will take the EU some weeks to prepare those plans.
If they cannot meet the deadline of the March summit, the start of trade talks could be pushed back, possibly even beyond the next formal EU summit in late June, jeopardising hopes of having an outline trade accord ready by the end of the year.
“We still expect to be able to have the trade guidelines for the March summit,” one senior EU official said. “But Theresa May is being so discreet. If she doesn't say what she wants, we may not be able to prepare our position in time.”
An EU diplomat involved in Brexit talks said: “It's for them to tell us what they want. If they don't do it in a timely manner, they would be shooting themselves in the foot again.”
Observer Report
Karachi
TV personality and politician Dr Aamir Liaquat Hussain has joined the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf at a joint press conference with the party chief, Imran Khan, in Karachi on Monday.
The announcement of Liaquat's induction into the party, along with actor Abid Ali, was made during the party's press conference in Karachi
Addressing press conference flanked by Khan, Hussain claimed that the PTI will clean sweep the forthcoming general elections from Karachi.
“It feels as if I was already a part of the PTI … this party is my final destination,” said the former Muttahida Qaumi Movement leader. “I have not joined [Imran] Khan but I have joined Pakistan … our joint fight will be against corruption,” he added.
Speaking earlier, the PTI chief said that Aamir Liaquat represented the ‘youth of Karachi'. “We want to take people on board to bring the change … Pakistan will not prosper until Karachi is developed,” said Khan, adding that “politicians learn from their past [and make the right decisions]”.
TV actor Abid Ali also announced joining the Imran Khan's party on the occasion. Hussain had parted ways with the MQM after a brief detention at Rangers headquarters in August 2016.
He was detained along with nine other MQM leaders after party workers attacked media houses following the party's supremo Altaf Hussain's ‘anti-Pakistan' speech.
Aamir has also served as minister of state for religious affairs in Shaukat Aziz's Cabinet between 2004 and 2007.
“Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League-N has been ruling since twenty years,” the PTI chief stated while addressing an event in Karachi.
Meanwhile, according to a news channel, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf workers expressed intense disapproval regarding Aamir Liaquat's decision of joining the party, causing pandemonium during party chief Imran Khan's address held on Sunday.
As a result Imran Khan was not able to make his speech during the public meeting in Karachi.
According to media reports, when former MQM leader and TV host Aamir Liaquat announced his joining PTI officially, other workers of the party chanted slogans against the decision. Due to this, Imran Khan was forced to leave mid-way.

Firefighters Lose Ground On Largest Of California Fires
Enlarge this image toggle caption Mike Eliason/AP Mike Eliason/AP
The largest and most destructive of the wildfires in California continued to burn its way up the coast on Sunday, becoming the fifth-largest in the state's history and sparking new evacuations in towns as far north as Santa Barbara.
By late Sunday afternoon, the Thomas Fire had destroyed 790 homes and other structures and left 90,000 homes and businesses without electricity. It has grown to about 230,000 acres – or 360 square miles. The fire is spreading so rapidly that containment on Sunday was downgraded from 15 percent to just 10 percent.
More than 4,000 firefighters were engaged in the effort to contain the flames. Although the Thomas Fire is still raging, most of the smaller fires are being gradually brought under control, officials said.
Jonathan Bastian of member station KCRW says that strong and unpredictable winds have kept fire crews scrambling to stay ahead of the Thomas Fire. Crews were using water-dropping planes and helicopters to battle the fires.
"The air quality remains so bad that schools and colleges have canceled classes," Jonathan reports. "In downtown Santa Barbara, a layer of white ash has descended over a city famous for its pristine beaches."
Chris Harvey of Cal Fire, says he is hopeful that the high winds could die down soon, giving firefighters the upper hand.
"They're expected to die down a little bit moving into Tuesday and Wednesday," he says. "So, we're hoping for a break from the wind."
Sunday brought mandatory evacuations for the Central Coast areas of Carpinteria, Summerland, Montecito and Santa Barbara – some of which have not been affected by wildfires in decades.
The biggest concern is for Carpinteria, where the fire was moving west above the city in an area of very dry vegetation that hasn't burned in about 100 years, Steve Swindle, a spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department was quoted by The Los Angeles Times as saying.
The Associated Press reports that officials "handed out masks to residents who stayed behind in Montecito, the wealthy hillside enclave that's home to celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bridges and Rob Lowe."
"This is a menacing fire, certainly, but we have a lot of people working very diligently to bring it under control," Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told an evening news conference, according to Reuters.
About 5,000 residents were under evacuation orders in the area and 15,000 homes were threatened.
KPCC reports that University of California, Santa Barbara, announced Sunday afternoon that it would postpone final exams due to the fires.
In an email to students from Chancellor Henry T. Yang, he said the campus would remain open, but he encouraged all students who want to leave to do so.
Gov. Jerry Brown warned on Saturday that the long-running drought in California that has quite literally added fuel to the fire, had extended fire season.
"This is the new normal," Brown said as he surveyed damage from the Thomas Fire. "We're about ready to have firefighting at Christmas. This is very odd and unusual."

The internet is massive and each corner is prepared with traps, tricks, and tips that can either help you succeed or bring you down. The information offered here is meant to help you create the most productive search engine optimization strategy you can build and then, expand it into an empire of your liking.
In search engine optimization, a website with many links leading to it from other sites, will receive a big boost to its position on the results page. Search engines give great weight to exterior links that mention search terms when evaluating the relevance of a particular website. Cultivating these links is an effective search engine optimization strategy.
If your website provides a local service, it is important to use the name of the area that you serve as one of your keywords. For instance, use "our Minneapolis pizza" instead of simply "our pizza." This will make it easier for people who live within your particular market to find your site.
You can bring in new traffic to your web site by posting on forums in your chosen niche. Most forums allow links in, either your signature area or on your profile, but read the rules first. When you comment on the forums, make sure your comments are helpful. Answer questions, ask pertinent questions, be friendly and have fun.
Learn how much experience this expert actually has. Look into the risks that are involved, so you are sure to make an informed decision.
Use your location to your benefit. Type in the name of the location you are at to have search engines include you when someone types that same wording into the search bar. For example, if a searcher types "Snyder Village shops" and you had mentioned your "Snyder village store location," you are very likely to show up in the search results.
Make sure you're using analytics on your website. Analytics allow you to measure the traffic to your site. It'll tell you where people are located, the browser they're using, how long they spend on the site, what they visit, and how they found the site. You can use this information to figure out what's drawing people to your website and allow you to use that to increase your traffic.
Keep the content as your base. The more content you have on your website, the more readers you will gain. No one likes to click on a site and be bombarded with links and advertisements. If you keep your own content front and center, readers will feel much more comfortable on your page and will likely keep coming back for more.
Use keywords naturally. Many article marketers want to stuff their articles with as many keywords as they can because they are trying to get the search engines to "see" their article, but the truth is this: people have to read articles too. If you use keywords in your article, be natural and conversational so that people keep reading it.
Adopt SEO style when writing. This means repeating original keywords and related one, but not in a rigid way. You can use alternative keywords or slightly change your original keywords. Make sure to include enough reference so that your content is categorized as relevant to the keywords you want it to be associated with.
When describing your business or its products or services on your website, you want to keep search engine optimization in mind. However, your first priority should be your potential customers, not the search engines they may use. Place keywords strategically within your descriptions, but don't go overboard. Your text should flow smoothly and be user-friendly and easy to read. There are many ways to help buyers find your website, but repeating the same keyword phrase ten times within one paragraph isn't the optimal way to do it.
Using analytic tools will help the savvy webmaster judge the effectiveness of his or her search engine optimization. Analytic tools can show exactly what keywords searchers used to locate the webmaster's site. This allows the webmaster to tailor his or her SEO strategy even further and focus on those keywords that have proven most effective.
As was mentioned earlier in this article, the key to your website's performance, is search engine optimization. If your site is properly optimized, it will increase its search page rank and, as a result, will have many more daily visitors. The more visitors you have to your site, the more profit you will make. Apply the search engine optimization advice contained in this article and you will be on your way to increasing your site's traffic and making a lot more money.
Tarek and Christina El Moussa have taken to Instagram to express their thoughts on 2016. Less than one month ago, fans believed Tarek and Christina El Moussa were a happy couple working on flipping houses together on their HGTV series, Flip or Flop, as they enjoyed being parents to their children, 7-year-old daughter Taylor Reese and 1-year-old son Brayden James. However, in mid-December, a shocking report hit the web in which it was revealed that the television stars had called it quits months ago. On December 12, TMZ revealed Tarek and Christina El Moussa had secretly separated after a terrifying incident at their Yorba Linda, California home involving “guns and a feared suicide attempt.” As the 7th season of Flip or Flop premiered on HGTV, the outlet revealed that 11 deputies responded to “a call of a possibly suicidal male with a gun” in May and brought a helicopter along with them in hopes of locating Tarek, who had reportedly fled his home with a gun. After locating Tarek on a hiking trail, the television star reportedly informed deputies that he had no intention of hurting himself and simply wanted to “blow off some steam.” As for why he brought a gun along with him through the woods, he claimed to have brought the weapon for protection from mountain lions and rattlesnakes. Speaking to TMZ after the incident, Tarek and Christina El Moussa referred to the incident as a “unfortunate misunderstanding” but confirmed they had gone their separate ways.

[Image by Jerod Harris/Getty Images] In the weeks since Tarek and Christina El Moussa ended their relationship, they've both been linked to other people, him to his former nanny and her to their former contractor, but when it comes to confirming their alleged new romances, they've stayed mum. While Tarek and Christina El Moussa aren't on board with exposing their potential new relationships online, they've both remained active on Facebook and Instagram and over the weekend, they looked back on their dramatic year with a couple of Instagram posts. “2016 has been a crazy year of highs and lows,” Christina El Moussa wrote in a post to fans on January 1. “A lot of things have changed but one thing will always remain a constant in my life and that is the love I have for our children… their genuine happy spirit is always the light at the end of the tunnel. May 2017 be a start to a fabulous year ahead and bring happiness, peace, joy and new adventures to you all.” Around the same time, Tarek shared a post about the rights and wrongs of his year. “Today signifies they end of another year. It's a time where we all reflect on our own personal journey. Looking back we must ask ourselves what we did right and what we did wrong. It's a time to look back and ask ourselves if we took advantage of the year we will never get back,” he wrote. Christina El Moussa visited the HGTV Santa HQ on December 13, 2014

It was a year that will change the destination of my life and I'm ready for the ride,” Tarek continued. “The crazy ride of 2016 taught me so much about myself. Today, going into 2017, I've learned i'm much stronger than I ever thought possible and the lessons I learned in 2016 will stay with me through the rest of my life. I truly believe in all these words and I urge everyone to look back and ask yourself what lessons can you take from 2016 to make 2017 the best year ever!!” To see more of Christina and Tarek El Moussa, don't miss new episodes of their HGTV series, Flip or Flop, on Thursday nights at 9 p.m. [Featured Image by Jerod Harris/Getty Images]

“It doesn't work just to take a child out of their home and their families and expect it to be okay. It's not okay,” foster mother Janet Michaylow said.
Over 50,000 children are in the Canadian Foster Care System (CFS); over 25 per cent of them are Indigenous, a ratio that climbs as high as 70 per cent depending on the province or territory.
It's a ratio that doesn't hold true for foster parents, where the number of Indigenous parents is more reflective of the three per cent of the Canadian population that is Indigenous.

The result is a generation of children who don't know their ancestry.
Michaylow has fostered 23 children; all six months or younger when she and her partner took them in.
“It's a learning curve for sure, we don't know a lot about Indigenous culture,” Michaylow explained. Now she's learning on the job, and teaching her kids along the way.
“We start reading little Cree words to them in their stories, we take them to the powwows that are going on, and we attended a day of the cultural camp that the Saskatchewan Foster Families Association does for families,” she said.
For Michaylow, it's a personal quest.
“I can relate because my dad actually came from India and he never taught me any of my culture,” Michaylow explained. “I never knew any of my extended family, and that has always been a little bit of a hole in my life. I don't want that for my children.”

Rose Harris was adopted at birth, her Indian name is Walks Among The Stars. Although she was never fostered by Michaylow, she had a similar experience with her family.
“I didn't have very pointed questions, just in general wanted to learn about everything I could, and gain more knowledge about myself, my history, my background, my family, my Indigenous culture,” Harris said.
With the help of her parents, Harris is slowly discovering her heritage through cultural camps, language training and powwows.
“It's not about race, but when it comes to identity, let's instil the pride if they're Indigenous children,” asserted Cowessess First Nation Chief Cadmus Delorme.
Delorme is the first of his family not to have gone through CFS. Instead, he adopted one of the young girls Michaylow fostered as an infant.

Now he works with other foster families to teach Indigenous culture to their children.
“It's about identity, it's about braid, it's about having that prayer song and that prayer in hand at any time that you're going to need it in life,” Delorme explained.
It's a sentiment matched by Micahylow.
“They're worth it, they're special and they need to know their place in our lives, in their city, and in history and in the future,” she added.
Winnipeg Police Service (WPS) and CAA Manitoba partnered up to study traffic violations at lit crosswalks last week.
The safety assessment was conducted before students go on spring break, and looked at five specific locations with heavy traffic volumes — several of which were near schools.
The morning and afternoon observation periods showed nearly 600 pedestrians using the crosswalks and 359 traffic violations.
No tickets were issued, but police kept an eye on how many incidents were spotted.
RELATED: Winnipeg police frustrated texting and driving still continues on the roads
Observers said pedestrians and drivers all need to take better care when it comes to safety.
CAA Manitoba's Liz Kulyk said often, the pedestrian-activated lights gave kids crossing the street a false sense of security.
“What you saw the kids doing was hitting the button, not skipping a beat, not looking and continuing to cross,” she said. “They were putting their lives in the hands of the cars.”
“What we saw the cars doing was unfortunate — there were very few cars that came to a complete stop,” Kulyk continued.
In one specific location, at Broadway Avenue and Furby Street, cars often didn't give way to pedestrians — even when the flashing lights had been activated.
Insp. Gord Spado of the WPS traffic division said this study was valuable for helping quantify traffic infractions on a regular basis.
“The goal is to have zero fatalities on roadways resulting from traffic collisions,” he said. “Every year in Winnipeg, a large percentage of our serious collision investigations involve pedestrians.”
Spado reminded drivers that school zone speed limits remain in effect during spring break and other holidays.

During last Tuesday's study, 30 pedestrians were spotted on their phones while crossing the road. Another 22 people didn't press the button to activate the crosswalk lights before crossing, and 19 individuals jaywalked.
When it came to drivers, 88 cars didn't stop for the lights and another 77 stopped after they had already driven across part of the crosswalk.
Spado noted there were a number of drivers multitasking behind the wheel, including one woman putting on makeup while driving and someone driving while smoking.
He said he wants to see tougher penalties for distracted driving — not just for people using phones while driving.
“Dogs on people's laps, eating, drinking, putting on makeup, shaving, brushing your teeth, I've seen all of those.”
Right now, getting caught doing any of the above activities wouldn't net you a penalty for distracted driving according to Spado. A $204 fine and five demerit points on your license only applies to cell phone use, for now.

While a growing number of vehicles come with hands-free communication options, like Bluetooth, Kulyk noted that doesn't always mean drivers are focused on the roads.
ISLAMABAD-Former Olympian Shahnaz Sheikh believes Pakistan's victory in the first match of the World Hockey League (WHL) semi-final against the Netherlands would be vital for moving ahead in the tournament.
Pakistan would open their WHL campaign against the Netherlands on June 15, then will play Canada on June 16, India on June 18 and Scotland on June 20. The former coach said Pakistan's first match against the Netherlands would be very crucial in building-up the team's confidence level in the whole tournament. "Pakistan should play attacking hockey in the tournament and should not get under-pressure," he said.
Sheikh said this time it would be a bit easier for 13th-ranked Pakistan team to secure a place in the World Cup as the number of participating teams has been increased to 16. He said Pakistan failed to qualify in the 2014 edition as the number of teams in the marquee event was 12. "This time Pakistan has very bright chances to qualify for the mega event," he said.
Five continental tournament champions, hosts India and top ten ranked teams from Hockey WHL Round 2 will qualify for the World Cup. Twenty teams will be seen in action in the two legs of HWL Round 2, one next month in London and the second in Johannesburg in July. "I think continental champions and India will also be among top five teams in each leg. So, most probably top eight teams from each of the ten-team HWL Round 2 will qualify for the World Cup," he added. He said that Asia Cup later this year would also offer a chance to qualify for the World Cup but for Pakistan that would be difficult. Responding to a question, Sheikh said Pakistan would easily beat India in the WHL match as Pakistan team is young but better then the arch-rivals.
(Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg faced calls on Monday from U.S. and European lawmakers to explain how a consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's election campaign gained access to data on 50 million Facebook users.
Facebook's shares fell more than 7 percent, wiping around $40 billion off its market value, set for their biggest drop since September 2012.
Lawmakers in the United States, Britain and Europe have called for investigations into media reports that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested the private data on more than 50 million Facebook users to support Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign. (reut.rs/2pn8btD)
The scrutiny presents a new threat to Facebook's reputation, which is already under attack over Russians' use of Facebook tools to sway American voters with “fake news” posts before and after the 2016 U.S. elections.
Facebook was already facing new calls on Saturday for regulation from U.S. Congress and questions about personal data safeguards after the reports in the New York Times and London's Observer over the weekend.
“It's clear these platforms can't police themselves,” Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar tweeted.
“They say ‘trust us.' Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary,” she added, referring to a committee she sits on.
On Monday, Republican Senator John Kennedy joined Klobuchar in calling on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking for answers to questions regarding the company's policies for sharing user data with third parties.
Wyden, an influential senator on technology issues, asked how many times during the past ten years Facebook was aware of third parties collecting or processing data in violation of the company's platform policies, among several other questions.
“The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook's data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley's use of data.
Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.
It was not clear whether Republicans who hold congressional committee gavels would announce any hearings related to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. But the calls reflected mounting bipartisan concern in Washington over whether internet firms are operating as fair trustees of the massive amounts of user data they collect.

Facebook said on Friday that it had learned in 2015 that a Cambridge University psychology professor had lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from a psychology testing app he had built.
Facebook said it suspended the firms and researchers involved. It also said the data had been misused but not stolen, because users gave permission.
Cambridge Analytica and its CEO were not immediately available to comment on Monday.
Facebook shares fell 7 percent at $172.17, dragging the S&P 500 technology sector down 2.5 percent and weighing on the overall U.S. equity market.
Fears of increased regulation also weighed on peers. Shares of Twitter Inc fell 1.6 percent, Google parent Alphabet Inc lost 3.6 percent, and Snapchat parent Snap Inc lost 4.1 percent.

“Tech companies all use data one way or the other as part of their businesses,” said Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. “They are going to get a lot more scrutiny over what data they are collecting and how they are using it.”
‘VERY CONCERNING'
A spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said the allegations were “clearly very concerning ... It is essential that people can have confidence that their personal data will be protected and used in an appropriate way.”
Britain's Information Commissioner's Office said it would be considering the potential new evidence as part its separate civil and criminal probe into whether Facebook user data had been abused in British elections.
Related Coverage Democratic senator asks Zuckerberg about Facebook data
UK Parliamentary committee chairman and Conservative lawmaker Damian Collins said Facebook had avoided answering straight questions from the committee about what it knew about the abuse of its users' social media data by Cambridge Analytica.
“Someone has to take responsibility for this. It's time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” Collins said in a statement.
The head of the European Parliament said on Monday EU lawmakers will investigate whether data misuse had taken place, calling the allegations an unacceptable violation of citizens' privacy rights.
Germany's Greens party also said it had asked the German government to report to parliament about the domestic impact.
In their joint letter, Kennedy and Klobuchar asked Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley to hold a hearing with Zuckerberg and the chief executives of and Twitter and Alphabet Inc's Google.
Moby tweeted out a message on Tuesday: “It's not inconceivable that @realdonaldtrump will resign.”
Like the many other performers, actors and artists who are not shy about speaking out against the president, Moby's comment may not seem all that out of the ordinary. But it followed a curious set of posts on Monday that suggested that he had some information about what is ahead for the White House.
On Instagram, he posted that “after spending the weekend talking to friends who work in dc i can safely (well, ‘accurately'…) post the following things…” He then listed a series of claims, including that Trump's administration is in collusion with the Russian government, that the administration is looking to star a war with Iran and that the right wing is planning to get rid of him.
“I'm writing these things so that when/if these things happen, there will be a public record beforehand,” he wrote.
He later tweeted that “most of the info i referenced is of public record, or will be relatively soon. also hoping # trump # bannon iran war plans are thwarted.”
We'll see, but the resignation of Michael Flynn as Trump's national security adviser was treated by some of Moby's followers that his predictions were coming true — even if White House spokesman Sean Spicer insisted that there was nothing illegal about Flynn's contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, but there was an issue with Flynn misleading about what he talked about with Kislyak.
Moby isn't the only celebrity figure to go beyond mere Trump criticism and into claims of insider information. During Trump's transition period, Tom Arnold claimed to have seen embarrassing Trump outtakes from “The Apprentice,” via password protected online access. No videos were ever produced.
On Monday, Arnold wrote, “Those tapes make no diff but tapes of Michael Flynn's calls 2 Russian Ambassador day of US sanctions starts 18 mo Trump Presidency crumble.”

The Kinsey Collection, a highly esteemed exhibit of African-American art and history, presented by Bernard and Khalil Kinsey on Feb. 3 in the USU ballroom.
Founders and owners of the collection, Bernard and Shirley Kinsey, have devoted their careers to acquiring and preserving collections of African-American art that spans about 500 years in history.
Khalil Kinsey, the son of Bernard and Shirley, is the Chief Operating Officer for the collection and joined Bernard in the presentation.
According to the informational pamphlets, The Kinsey Collection primarily sets out to use its array of historic African-American artifacts to, “…bring a new understanding to the issues of equity and access in our school communities.”
The Kinseys displayed and gave commentary on works connected to various African-American inventors, entrepreneurs and activists, and they urged attendees to contemplate how the collection can connect to modern day civics and culture within the United States.
For instance, Kinsey presented Gayle Hubbard's “First Vote,” a watercolor illustration of African-American men standing in line to exercise their newly-earned right to vote in 1867.
After presenting this work, attendees were encouraged to think about theoretical questions of equity such as, “How would you feel if your classmates could vote, but you couldn't be based on one of your physical characteristics?” or, “How do you decide who you will vote for, and what or who might influence your decision?”
The Kinseys successfully used their diverse collection to make attendees think critically about the parallels between African-American culture and current issues regarding political and social equality.
TAMPA, Fla. — Police in Florida are investigating an incident at a nightclub where a photographer said he was “sucker punched” by singer Chris Brown.
Tampa police spokesman Stephen Hegarty says 28-year-old Bennie Vines Jr. was hired by Aja Channelside to take photos during an event hosted by Brown.
Vines told officers that while he was snapping photos early Monday, Brown punched him. Brown was gone by the time officers arrived. Vines refused medical treatment and told officers he wants to prosecute because of a minor lip cut.
The club confirmed the incident on its Facebook page Monday and apologized to patrons.
Brown, singer of the hits “Run It!” and “Deuces,” completed probation in a 2009 felony assault case for an attack on singer Rihanna, his then-girlfriend.
An email to the representative listed on Brown's website was not immediately returned.

BOSTON -- Kenya's Geoffrey Kirui won the 121st Boston Marathon on Monday, pulling away from American Galen Rupp with about two miles to go to win in an unofficial time of 2 hours, 9 minutes, 37 seconds.
Rupp, a three-time Olympian making his Boston debut, was 21 seconds behind and Japan's Suguru Osako was another 30 seconds back. Americans had six of the top 10 finishers in the men's race and two of the top four women.
Kenyan policewoman Edna Kiplagat won the women's race in 2:21:52, needing only one try in Boston to add it to wins in London, New York and Los Angeles. She pulled ahead of Rose Chelimo of Bahrain in the Newton hills to win by 59 seconds.
"When I was running, my body was feeling good," said Kiplagat, who was greeted at the finish line by two of her children. "I tried to push more, hard and I saw my [rivals] were not picking up the pace."
American Jordan Hasay, making her debut at the distance, was third and Desi Linden was fourth -- the first time since 1991 that two U.S. women have finished in the top four.

The warm temperatures that hit 79 degrees late in the race slowed the runners, but the strong tailwind was a boost -- especially for the wheelchair races.
Marcel Hug won Boston for the third time, outpushing 10-time champion Ernst Van Dyk and finishing in 1:18:04 to beat the course record and world best by 21 seconds. Fellow Swiss Manuela Schar shattered the women's mark by more than five minutes, winning in 1:28:17.
The winners' times on the point-to-point Boston course are considered a world best and not a world record because of the possibility of a supportive tailwind like the one on Monday.
"The wind is so important," Hug said. "The roads were good. Everything was fantastic today."
Earlier Monday, city officials announced plans for memorials to mark the sites where two bombs exploded during the 2013 Boston Marathon.
City officials and the families of five people who died in the bombing or its aftermath say there's also a plan to build a separate, larger memorial to victims, survivors and responders.
Pablo Eduardo is a Massachusetts resident and internationally known sculptor. He'll create the memorial markers on Boylston Street where bombs killed three spectators and wounded more than 260 others.
Eduardo said Monday his goal is to "embody the spirit of those we lost and the spirit of the city they loved."

Moscow
Russia is set to start registering some foreign media organizations operating in the country as “foreign agents” this week, in response to Washington's growing pressure on Russian media working abroad.
There will be nine US media outlets that will be listed by the Russian Justice Ministry as “foreign agents,” the RIA news agency cited a source at the upper house of Russia's parliament, the Federation Council, as saying on Monday.
The US government-sponsored Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) are likely to be included in the list. RIA also quoted Russia's communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, as saying that it would respond in kind to any violations of the rights of Russian companies and media abroad.
“It is completely clear that there is the need to react in kind to any violations of the rights of our companies as well as of our mass media,” said Roskomnadzor head Alexander Zharov. “And the Russian Federations has the tools to do this.”
President Vladimir Putin signed last month a measure into law that allows authorities to register foreign media outlets as “foreign agents.” The law had earlier passed both houses of the parliament.
The move against American media is part of Moscow's “mirror” response to a US congressional committee move against Russian international television network, RT, late last month. The congressional committee unanimously revoked RT America's credentials, after the company was forced by the Justice Department to register as a “foreign agent.”
The US accused Moscow of using Russian media organizations to influence US presidential election last year. Russia, however, has repeatedly denied the charges and said the restrictions on its broadcasters in the United States amount to an attack on free speech.—Agencies
After their much-acclaimed collaboration on “There Will Be Blood,” as well as lesser-known projects “The Master” and “Inherent Vice,” director Paul Thomas Anderson and Radiohead's multi-instrumentalist savant Jonny Greenwood have teamed up for the fourth consecutive time on “Phantom Thread.”
The film's piano-and-strings dominated score, which received a Golden Globes nomination for best original score, plays a key role in defining the lead characters of Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis), the 1950s London couture designer, and Alma (Vicky Krieps), his model and lover. Anderson first called Greenwood about it a year ago.
“We talked a lot about ‘50s music, what was popularly heard then as well as what was being written and recorded,” Greenwood tells Variety. “Nelson Riddle and Glenn Gould's Bach recordings were the main references. I was interested in the kind of jazz records that toyed with incorporating big string sections, Ben Webster made some good ones, and focus on what the strings were doing rather than the jazz musicians themselves.”
Greenwood reasoned that if Reynolds listened to music, it would have been Gould. “Lots of slightly obsessive, minimal baroque music,” says Greenwood of the sound the picture called for. “And we could use the piano as the common ground between the romantic music and the formal, slightly more buttoned-up themes that suited Reynolds.”

The romantic movements “couldn't cross into pastiche, or be in any way ironic,” he says. “It took a long time to figure out how to do that.” At one point, Greenwood recorded with an ensemble of 60 strings, his largest ever.
Some of the cues, however, are played by only a quartet. “The smaller groups, and solo players, work like close-ups [and] not necessarily to accompany [a] visual, but rather, to focus your attention on and make you feel directly engaged with the characters. The bigger orchestral things often worked best for drawing you back to see the bigger situation.”
Anderson first heard Greenwood's themes-in-progress at the musician's London studio.
“These were turned into a whole body of work for him to draw from, and to request longer, shorter, faster versions and variations,” says Greenwood, adding that, “Some cues were written specifically to scenes. Others were just sketches of the characters, or of the story.”
All told, some 90 minutes of music ended up in the final cut. Says Greenwood: “When I told [this to] Robert Ziegler, who conducted the score, he said, ‘That's not a soundtrack, that's a musical!' But I know I'm pretty lucky to work on films like this, where there's so much scope for developing a score over such a long time.”

Today's guest post was written by Alwyn Poole who showed me around three different schools when I was researching my series on Partnership schools. He says that the main challenge to Partnership school success right now is opposition to the sector and governmental indifference which is stalling growth just as the schools are gaining traction.
If education in New Zealand was a garden you would be highly concerned about the productivity of the soil, the growing conditions, and the nature and nutritional value of the crops.
Some examples:
National Standards: Under former education minister Hekia Parata a national goal was set to have 85% of NZ Year 1 – 8 students “at or above” national standards for reading, writing and maths. As at 2015, they were all below 80% (and as of writing closer to 70%) with Māori and Pasifika 15% behind European students. The rate for writing for those two groups sits just on 60% of the “at or above” standard. Where are we now? The 85% goals have recently been dropped. The reading goal has gone completely and the maths and writing versions are now 80%.
International comparisons: In maths, reading, science, New Zealand's performance has declined over the last 20 years in international surveys PISA and TIMMS (in which we are the worst English speaking nation).
NCEA: The government has made much of NCEA Level 2 reaching 85% pass rates. Astute media have dug a bit deeper and found that students are being eliminated out of courses and many Level 2 pathways dead-end and leave students stranded. It appears that this 85% goal has now been quietly dropped too. At UE – arguably a more significant cycle breaker – there was no goal. The 2016 outcomes there have Asian students at 66.5% pass, European students at 57.8%, Māori at 31.4% and Pasifika at 30.7%. These differences are so vast that some educationalists have reverted to pre-1960s thinking and started to talk about “appropriate pathways” for groups – a superb example of the “soft bigotry of low expectations”.
Willie Jackson is an intelligent and passionate man. He has had a look at the education garden and worked out where he can make a difference: getting involved in one of 10 currently operating partnership/charter schools in New Zealand (out of 2600 schools total). According to NZEI spokesperson Laures Park on Waatea news last week, “Charter Schools are a reality now… we can't shut them down now they are going.” Several others of various political stripes made similar statements to the effect that those which are working should be allowed to continue.
The Villa Education Trust operates two of the 10 schools: South Auckland Middle School and Middle School West Auckland. What we have achieved is significant.
South Auckland Middle School (SAMS) began in 2014 with only a four month lead-in and $1.1 million to cover all establishment costs. A comparative state school startup would have been approximately $27 million and an 18 month staffed lead-in. SAMS has flown since day one and currently has 180 students and approximately 70 on wait-lists. We teach the New Zealand curriculum, have had a very stable student body with minimum transience, and in 2016 showed an 18% improvement for our Year 7 and 8 students in their national standards, in contrast to the national pattern. At SAMS, 93% of our students are Māori or Pasifika. It received its 1% retention payments (Labour education spokesperson Chris Hipkins calls them bonuses) for 2014 and 2015.
Middle School West Auckland (MSWA) began in 2015. Again after being given only four months lead-in and, somehow, less money for establishment – despite the original maximum roll being listed at twice that of SAMS. Two state schools establishing through the same period, also for Year 7 – 10, were Rototuna (Hamilton), costing approximately $40m, and Ormiston Junior High, costing approximately $91m (currently listed as having 150 students).
The first year at MSWA was more difficult than SAMS and we have recently been told MSWA will not get the 1% for 2015. We accept that but making the decision 18 months late clearly has a limited effect. In 2016 we got things right at MSWA in terms of staffing and facilities and have begun 2017 with a great team, a stable 200-strong student cohort and significant progress happening. Of the students at MSWA, 88% are Māori or Pasifika. In 2017 we anticipate that same improvement pattern we saw for SAMS.
What does the policy allow us to do differently? One of the current myths is that these schools could simply have been “special character” schools. We had asked to have a “special character” school way back in the early 2000s when Labour was in government and were given the bum's rush. So instead we set up our private school in Newmarket (Mt Hobson Middle School) and waited and hoped for a wider opportunity to work with New Zealand children.
The key elements of the Partnership Schools policy introduced in 2011 are:
– Minimal start-up assistance. In fact, it has been so reduced since the policy's establishment that we have chosen not to apply in rounds three to five, and understand other organisations are in the same position.
– Per student funding that is comparable to decile one state schools of a similar size for SAMS, and decile three of a similar size for MSWA.
– We get the funding in bulk and are trusted to use that bulk funding to make good choices for the students, families and staff and generate improved outcomes. The teacher unions have refused to allow the government to bring in bulk funding for state schools so their principals do not have the same level of choice and ability to innovate.
– We have 15 students per class and 60 per “Villa” (mini-school within a school). We run a very hard-working academic morning and an effective arts and activities-based afternoon. Our school leaders have a teaching role. We frame our curriculum with set cross-curricula projects that the children have an hour a day to work on and hand in every five weeks – developing superb output skills along the way. We provide all uniform, stationery and IT. We pay our staff salaries at least 5% above state levels, provide other benefits for them and pay them directly for the development of some resources.
– It's working. In three and a half years our two partnership schools have a combined roll of approximately 400 students. A reasonable state comparison would be the two Hobsonville Point schools that were established on a $114 million budget in 2014 and have just over 700 students between them. On a cost to taxpayer basis we are doing very well. Our organisation is a charitable trust.
– Students are coming to us with huge need. In 2017 as few as 23% of our Year 7 entrants were “at or above” National Standards for reading, writing and maths.
There is a lot of work to do with these children over the four years they will spend with us – but we are confident we'll bring about significant change.
The recent media debate has been about whether the schools should stay open or not if there is a change of government. The best the opposition seems to have come up with in terms of education is “do-aways”: at various times they have promised to do away with National Standards and do away with charter schools. However recently it has begun grudgingly conceding that good things are happening in these schools and that the New Zealand education system is actually in a perilous state overall – making change, innovation and diversity of provision important
The smart play is to look to enhance and improve the policy; people like Peeni Henare, Kelvin Davis, Willie Jackson and the two current Māori Party MPs could be key to this. Reuben Wharawhara of He Puna Marama Trust, the Whangarei partnership school provider, recently told Waatea News the partnership schools policy is “one of the best things that have ever happened to [Māori].”
Unfortunately, progress is stalling. From 2011 to 2014 nine partnership schools were authorised and eight of those are functioning well; the ninth, the failed Whangaruru school, should never have been authorised in the first place. Under education undersecretary David Seymour, only two have been authorised and established so far. The funding for establishment has been reduced to a negligible amount, and thus the interest in the model and enhanced risks of failure for newly establishing schools.
The failure to agree terms with John Tamihere's Waipareira Trust was also a poor moment. The release of the second Martin Jenkins evaluation (five months late) made public that we have laid six formal disputes with the Ministry to try and improve the policy (for some reason David Seymour only acknowledged one of those when queried by Lisa Owen on The Nation in July 2016).
Early during Mr Seymour's term we tried to communicate the need for policy improvement but received two direct phone calls from him asking us not to put our concerns on email as they are “discoverable”. Maybe education is just not his thing and he feels slightly lumped with it through the 2011 coalition agreement. If so it should be handed onto someone who would truly see educational improvement for priority learners as a passion project – and has the ability to understand these families, be publicly transparent and listen well to the providers. We heard virtually nothing from Hekia Parata's office during her time as Minister of Education except to be told that we cannot be a part of Communities of Learning. We have some hope that Nikki Kaye will take a different approach.
We don't care what the schools are called (if Labour were in government they could be called Hipkinsonian Schools or Ardern's Awesome Academies for all we care) but the mechanism of private niche organisations being able to provide differentiated, innovative and effective education for priority learners should remain and be enhanced. Not only that but, as the Martin Jenkins report shows, there should be clear and supported pathways for growth and development and much-improved administrative processes and performance management through the Ministry.
People often ask us if the occasional public negativity of the government's social and political opponents has an impact on us. In terms of those who talk about us and not to us – to quote Roger Waters, we have become “comfortably numb”. So the answer is no effect whatsoever. Our clear and privileged focus is on providing an extraordinary education for the children and families we work with. We have a highly qualified, registered and passionate staff doing just that. By far the bigger impact on us is the need for the policy, and administration of it, to be improved to allow us to do our job even better.
Education is about change and all schools are funded to bring about change despite the circumstances. External social inequality is not an excuse for a school to fail to bring about progress for their students. Out in South Auckland we are proud to be near Manurewa Intermediate who are also doing exactly that – and being recognised for doing so.
Of most education interest in the election year should not be whether or not 10 charter schools will continue to exist beyond this year, but what superb, educationally sound, responsive policies and practices can the parties bring to the table to really get the garden producing for children through all 2600 schools. One of those policies should be how each party would look to significantly enhance the model currently called Partnership Schools.
The demand for winter foods and its sale has been increased in different markets of federal capital as the mercury coming down sharply. The people have started enjoying the traditional local winter foods like chicken corn soup, Kashmiri tea, fried fish, Doodh Jalebi, Gajrela, samosa, pakora, vegetable rolls, hot coffee and other items with the advent of harsh winter season.
Scores of temporary stalls have been set up by vendors where winter food items are being sold. The demand of fish has increased manifold and fish outlets in different areas of capital city were crowded with customers. Men, women and children come to these outlets to beat the cold with fried fish which is favorite dish of everyone but it becomes more popular in the winter season.
Nowadays, street vendors can also be seen selling uncooked fish on handcarts, bicycles and makeshift stall for Rs 300 to Rs 800 per kilogramme.
The winter food stalls are doing good business due to the rising demand for the foods, the owners of the these shops said.
“Kashmiri tea is also high in demand these days. “I prepare two drums of tea and it is sold like hot cake,” a vendor at Super Aabpara Market said.
Gajrela (Carrot sweet) is considered to be one of the un-put- down-able food items in winter. Prepared with carrots, condensed milk and dry fruits, the delicious dessert is not only a source of energy but also adds colour and taste to the meal.—APP

Shared challenges tend to draw people closer. And when you've been waiting outside since the night before in the minus 20s, it's not surprising.
That's what happened Saturday morning outside Royal Vale School in NDG where parents began camping out early Friday night hoping to secure a kindergarten spot for their kids. Spots are are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so when parents get a place in line, they hold it.
One parent had to leave because of an emergency and crossed her name off the list , but the other parents wouldn't hear of it.
“Seriously, go put it back,” insisted fellow parent Kathryn Shubin. “Go, seriously. We'll hold your spot,” she told her as they both began to cry.
Hours after the parent left, she sent four large pizzas to the group to thank them for holding her place.

Lining up outside the school has been tradition for decades. This year, people began arriving Friday night even though registration only opens on Monday.
“This year there are 29 spots available for new kindergarten students,” Shubin explained.
That is, only after parents with children already attending the school receive spots for siblings. At number eight on the list, Shubin expected to be able to get her daughter in.
“My daughter will be registering as the third generation who will be going to school in this building right here,” Shubin said with a grin.
But despite the cold, many parents say it's all worth it because of Royal Vale's enriched math and science programs and other offerings.
“There are a lot of extracurricular activities that make it a unique experience while still being a public school,” Shubin explained.

The other reason for the waitlist is that the school has open boundaries, so parents from other parts of the city can send their kids to Royal Vale — like Francois Xavier from Villeray, who was first in line.
“We were told the academics [are] good,” he says. “The after-school programs [and] the parent community apparently is great too, so these are many things we were looking for in a school.”
Some criticize the English Montreal School Board (EMSB) for not having a better registration procedure to prevent such lineups. But the parents who flock to Royal Vale in hopes of registering their kids just focus on the benefits.
“There's lots of socializing, getting to know one another,” Shubin notes of meeting other parents in line — bonds that could last for years if their kids end up going to the school together.
LAPEER (AP)  A Michigan woman charged with murder in the stabbing death of her adult son who had cerebral palsy is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty but mentally ill.

Becca Kufrin didn't end up doing the damn thing with Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr., who changed his mind choosing to propose to runner-up, Lauren Bushnell instead in a controversial finale. But that doesn't mean he's out of Becca's life completely. It turns out, Arie will appear on Becca's season of The Bachelorette whether fans want him to or not. Though, it seems Becca was happy to have one last conversation with her former fiancé.
In a May 30 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Becca revealed that Arie will stop by the mansion. "He will show up, yes," Becca said, teasing that the two will "have a conversation and you'll just have to see that unfold." While she didn't give any specifics, Becca did say that the chat the two shared "wasn't emotional, it was just two adults sitting down, wishing each other the best and talking through our experiences."
Becca added, "That was our last conversation we've had. I knew that would probably be the last time we had a conversation, and I wish him and Lauren the best." Becca has said she's so over the Bachelor drama that she would attend Arie and Lauren's wedding, if she's invited. "I don't know if they'd invite me," she told People last week. "But, yeah, if they would want me there, I would want to share in their love because I truly do wish them nothing but happiness."
This is after her breakup with this guy was broadcast to millions. Seriously, Becca should teach a class about how to get over the guy, because the rest of the world could learn a thing or two from her about resilience.
The last time Arie and Becca spoke was on the After The Final Rose special in which she revealed she was open to continuing the process on The Bachelorette. "At the end of the day, the show is about finding love. I have a lot of love to give," she said on ATFR. Becca continued, "I want to be the best damn Bachelorette I can be. I'm so excited. I want to find love. I'm just so excited, I just want to do this.”
It shouldn't be all that surprising to hear that Arie's was returning for Becca's season of The Bachelorette, especially to anyone who saw her first Bachelorette promo in which she ripped up a photo of Arie. The former Bachelor looms over the season with one of the guys bringing a cardboard cutout of Arie and Becca admitting her favorite date was destroying Arie-related items.
But the truth is, Becca expected Arie to play a crucial role in her Bachelorette journey. "I clearly was heartbroken by Arie and that was hard, but what's hard for me is having to break somebody [else's] heart," she told Entertainment Tonight. "It was difficult being in this position, kind of having that power to say goodbye and to hurt people." She realized, though, that she had to do that to find love.
Becca's revealed that she's engaged and while fans will have to wait a bit longer to find out to whom, she's said she's really happy. "It was the happiest moment of my life. And it feels so good to say it," Becca told People earlier this week about finding the man of her dreams. "I still pinch myself, like, did that all just happen? It's been a whirlwind.”
While Arie will make an appearance on The Bachelorette, it's clear Becca's moved on to better things. Of course, that won't stop Bachelor Nation from seeing what goes down when Arie returns to the show, which this time stars Becca.

The Riverside County District Attorney's Office has asked for an arrest warrant against Carlos Valencia, the employer of two men who were fatally electrocuted in March 2016 while pollinating palm trees in Thermal.
An investigation into the deaths of Osvaldo Ceron and Ernesto Hurtado found that Carlos Valencia, owner of Valencia Trimming in La Quinta, misclassified employees to make their jobs appear to be lower risk to his insurance provider and lied about employee pay, according to court documents filed by the DA's office.
Valencia deprived California's insurance fund for workers' compensation of $100,000 and cost the state more than $35,000 in unreported payroll taxes between 2012 and 2017, the arrest declaration says.
The district attorney filed the felony charges against Valencia, 49, on Dec. 7 with a recommended cash bond of $135,000.
Valencia Trimming employees Ceron and Hurtado were electrocuted while pollinating palm trees at 68600 Harrison Ave. in Thermal on March 12, 2016.
The two men were using a truck with a boom. Hurtado was maneuvering the boom when the bucket carrying both men made contact with a power line, according to the DA, shocking them.
Ceron fell from the bucket to the ground, where he was found dead by a third employee. Hurtado remained in the bucket, which caught fire while the group waited for the power company to shut off the power line. He was electrocuted and burned.
According to the DA, Valencia misreported both pay rate and worker classification to the State Compensation Insurance Fund, or SCIF, the $1-billion fund created by the state of California to provide workers' compensation coverage.
Desert Sun file photo (Photo: Desert Sun file photo)
Employer insurance premiums are determined, in part, by each worker's classification and pay rate. It is considered fraud to underreport wages or classify workers in jobs that are deemed to be less dangerous, both of which reduce insurance costs.
But the discovery that an insurance policy was obtained through fraudulent means does not mean workers will be unprotected, said Jennifer Vargen, a spokesperson for SCIF.
In this case, both Ceron and Hurtado's beneficiaries have received death benefits, Vargen said. One of their cases has been closed and the other remains open.
In the case that a policy has been rescinded because it was found to be obtained by fraudulent means, workers can also receive benefits through the Uninsured Employers Benefits Trust Fund, which pays claims by employees injured while working for illegally uninsured employers.
"The system is designed to protect workers," Vargen said. "There is a backup."
SCIF issued Valencia Trimming an insurance policy effective in 2012. But Valencia "reported his payroll under landscaping and not tree trimming," a classification that lowered Valencia's insurance rate prior to the deaths of Ceron and Hurtado. Valencia later admitted to SCIF that "no landscaping operations are performed" by his business, according to the DA.
Valencia also underreported employee payroll wages to SCIF and to state tax authorities, the declaration says. For example, Valencia told SCIF investigators after the incident that Hurtado had earned $15,000 annually and that Ceron had earned $11,000 annually, but previously reported to SCIF that his business had no payroll wages during periods when one or both men were employees.
SCIF found that Valencia "never reported any payroll wages" to the Employment Development Department, California's largest tax collection agency.

“He came up to the writers' room on Saturday Night Live — by the way, no one ever walked up there — and just said, ‘I wanted to see what's going on in here,'” Mulaney recalls. “And we were all like ‘T.I.!' And Seth [Meyers] made a joke he liked, and he threw, like, five $100 bills on the table and said, ‘I like that.' And he kept the money.”

Friends and family of Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old woman killed while marching in an anti-racism march on Saturday, are speaking out following her death.
White nationalists gathered in in Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday where they chanted Nazi slogans and carried Confederate flags and torches. During their "Unite the Right" march, they were met by counterprotesters. Around 1:45 p.m., 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr., of Ohio, plowed his Dodge Challenger through anti-racism protesters, reversing midway through and hitting dozens.
Heyer was killed in the attack and more 19 were injured.
Marissa Blair worked with Heyer at a Charlottesville law firm. The pair attended the counterprotest together on Saturday.
Blair spoke of Heyer's death and President Donald Trump on CNN Monday.
"Heather would not want his condolences," Blair said. "She would not want him to speak her name."
Heyer dedicated her life to campaigning against hate, friends and family say.
"He won't denounce white supremacy, he won't denounce racism because he's scared that he's going to lose his followers," Blair said on CNN, of Trump. "He needs to be worried about the United States and not his followers, and not the power and not his publicity and not his golf trips."
Blair asked the president to focus not on his political image but on the suffering in Charlottesville. "He needs to worry about my friend that died, he needs to worry about the people that were injured, he needs to worry about her family, he needs to worry about America's family."
She spoke to CNN while wearing a purple shirt featuring a photo of Heyer under the words, "If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention." The phrase was Heyer's final post on Facebook prior to her death.
Trump's national security adviser said this weekend the violence in Virginia "meets the definition of terrorism."
H.R. McMaster said on ABC's "This Week" that "anytime that you commit an attack against people to incite fear, it is terrorism."

Eliver “KillerKai” Ling keeps taking off his shirt during fighting game tournaments.
Advertisement
Last night, KillerKai dramatically removed his shirt at the Marvel vs. Capcom 3 NorCal Regionals, right before his final match in the best of three against ApologyMan. The shirt removal has become a notorious intimidation technique for him. It doesn't always psych out his opponents, but the crowd eats it up every time.
The score was tied up, with KillerKai having won his first match and lost his second. In the pause between matches, members of the crowd rose to their feet, crowing with anticipation, their camera phones at the ready. Everyone knew what was coming. It was time for KillerKai to take off his shirt.
Advertisement
So he did. And then… he lost the match. Real bad.
ApologyMan had seen KillerKai's shirtless technique in the past. He saw it exactly one year ago, at the 2016 NorCal regionals. Back then, ApologyMan couldn't hack it. He lost to KillerKai's shirtless grace:
Now, ApologyMan has learned his lesson. But he should have learned it long ago. KillerKai has been using this technique for six years running. He first showed off his torso in 2011 at a fight night broadcasted by Offcast. After losing one of his MvC3 matches, KillerKai got up from his seat, paced the room, and removed his shirt in a fit of pique:
At the time, announcers laughed off KillerKai's stunt, with one describing his body as “blinding.” Still, the move worked. As you can see in the video, KillerKai's opponent laughed too hard to block his opponent's initial combos. The shirtless technique served its purpose as a psychological distraction.

But the distraction doesn't always work, especially when an opponent can equal KillerKai's bravado. In this 2013 match at Curleh Mustache West Vol. 2, after KillerKai removes his shirt and flexes for the crowd, his opponent seems intimidated. Then, he removes his shirt also, and wins his final match against KillerKai.
(Correction, 3:15 PM: An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of this match.)
The following year, KillerKai took a break from pro gaming to focus on his acting career (that seems like a better application for his, er, performative streak). The month before he went on a pro gaming hiatus, he played at the SoCal Regionals, won some matches, and took his shirt off in a celebratory gesture. This is a way safer tactic, since it removes the double humiliation of losing both your shirt and a match.
A few other fighting game players have tried the shirtless technique, such as Poongko, who started taking off his shirt during Street Fighter matches back in 2014. Back at Evo 2011, when Poongko beat Street Fighter veteran Daigo Umehara, he took off his belt in a show of defiance, which some consider to have popularized the clothing-removal trend. Technically, KillerKai did it first, for those keeping score.

As we've seen, KillerKai is still using the technique to this day, in spite of the fact that it doesn't seem to reliably work. Unless the point is to show off his abs. In that case, it definitely works.
Mon, Dec 11: Winter-like weather arrived in the GTA Monday afternoon and police warned drivers to be extra careful. Ashley Molnar reports from the Eastern Salt Yards.
More than 200 bodies have been recovered after a mudslide near Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown.
A morgue official in Sierra Leone's capital says more than 200 bodies have been brought in following heavy flooding and mudslides.
Sinneh Kamara, a coroner technician at the Connaught Hospital mortuary, told the national broadcaster on Monday that the number of corpses brought in has overwhelmed the facility.
He told the Sierra Leone National Broadcasting Corp that bodies were on the floor of the morgue.
Footage on television showed family members digging through mud in a desperate bid to free their loved ones.
Deputy Information Minister Cornelius Deveaux said officials are still trying to compile casualty figures.
Many of the impoverished areas of Sierra Leone's capital are close to sea level and have poor drainage systems, exacerbating flooding during this West African country's rainy season.
A handout photo made available by Thai Navy Seal on July 4, 2018, shows Thai Navy officers and rescuers work inside a cave complex during the ongoing rescue operations for the child soccer team and their assistant coach, at Tham Luang cave in Khun Nam Nang Non Forest Park, Chiang Rai province, Thailand.
THAI NAVY SEAL / HANDOUT, EPA-EFE
Dramatic rescues from mines and caves should provide hope to families in Thailand awaiting word on the fate of a young soccer team trapped in a vast, watery cave.
The boys and their 25-year-old coach vanished almost two weeks ago after entering the cave before flooding caused by heavy rains blocked their exit. Divers found them Monday, hungry but safe. Now authorities are trying to determine how to get them out.
"The average person can't imagine how difficult it would be," said Robert Laird, co-founder of the U.S.-based International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery. "These kids are not diving just to go diving. They are in a life-or-death situation."
There have been many rescues around the globe over the years. Here are some of the most dramatic:
'Estamos bien en el refugio, los 33'
A cave-in at a mine in Copiapó, Chile, on Aug. 5, 2010, trapped 33 men almost a half-mile underground. There was no word from the victims for 17 days, until rescuers drilled a test hole and sent a probe down into the mine. When they pulled the probe back up, a note was attached. The English translation: "We are fine in the shelter, the 33 of us." Chilean officials teamed up with NASA and dozens of corporations in a global rescue effort. Food and water were sent down while an extrication plan was developed and executed. Trapped for 69 days, the men emerged essentially unharmed to worldwide acclaim.

'Nine for nine'
Nine workers at the Quecreek Mine in Somerset Count, Pennsylvania, were trapped after accidentally breaking through a wall, releasing more than 70 million gallons of water into the mine on July 24, 2002. Rescuers feverishly drilled holes 240 feet down to provide air, not knowing if anyone was alive. More holes were drilled to pump water out of the mine. "Nine for nine" was the optimistic slogan Gov. Mark Schweiker coined as the nation awaited word. Three days later a microphone was sent down, and rescuers finally learned that all nine men were alive, trapped in a four-foot high tunnel. The next day all were retrieved safely. The result was the book "Nine For Nine: The Pennsylvania Mine Rescue Miracle."
'Magnificent operation' saves 7 in France
Seven experience potholers were trapped when heavy rains blocked exits to a five-mile network of caves in southern France on Nov. 22, 1999. That began a 10-day odyssey that gripped the European nation. Teams drilled a series of holes in an effort to find the men, who were carefully rationing food, water and lamp fuel. Virtually all hope was lost when they were finally found and brought back to the surface, still with about two more days of their minimal supplies. Regional Gov. Michel Sappin called the effort a "magnificent operation," adding that the "best reward was to be able to give the families the good news."

It was only one person and the rescue only took 2 1/2 days, but very few news stories have seized the nation's attention the way tiny Jessica McClure did. She was 18 months old when she fell into a backyard well at her aunt's daycare center in Midland, Texas, on Oct. 14, 1987. With cable news just coming into its own — CNN had been broadcasting for seven years — the story of Baby Jessica drew 24/7 coverage. The well was 22 feet deep and only eight inches wide. Dense rock slowed efforts to drill a parallel shaft. Rescuers asked her to sing so they knew she was ok, and the song from Winnie the Pooh brought tears to their eyes. She was extricated to wild applause after 58 hours, losing a toe, gaining a small scar on her forehead but otherwise in good shape. A photo of the little girl, caked in dirt, being removed from the well would have gone viral if such things occurred in 1987. Some solace for photographer Scott Shaw: It won him a Pulitzer Prize.

WASHINGTON - A federal judge Monday is set to home in on a question left open by federal courts since the struggles over detentions of suspected al-Qaida members and other terrorists after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks: how long can the government hold a U.S. citizen captured on the battlefield without letting him challenge his detention?
U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the District of Columbia set the 10 a.m. hearing in a petition brought by the ACLU. The organization seeks to represent an unidentified citizen and suspected member of the Islamic State detained as an enemy combatant for nearly threemonths without a charge. He was captured in Syria and transferred to the U.S. military. (Continued below)

At issue is the U.S. governments assertion that it can secretly hold the man without court review for a to-be-determined reasonable period before deciding his disposition. The government is also opposing the ACLUs attempt to be the mans lawyer.
The Pentagon disclosed Nov. 30 - at Chutkans order - that the American had asserted his constitutional rights to a lawyer, halting law enforcement questioning. But the Pentagon stated in filings that it was not currently aware whether he wanted to challenge his detention in court.
Justice Department lawyers asked Chutkan to toss the ACLUs habeas corpus petition on legal grounds, saying the group could show no relation to the man that would give it standing to sue on his behalf. As a result, the Justice Department argued, the court had no authority to weigh in on wartime detentions by the U.S. military in an overseas conflict zone.
Chutkan expressed incredulity at the circularity of that claim, saying it was the government that is withholding the mans identity, preventing legal counsel from establishing contact with him or his family.
Referring to an assertion of authority to indefinitely detain a citizen without court review, Chutkan said, That scenario, that kind of unchecked power, is, quite frankly, frightening.
ACLU attorney Jonathan Hafetz in an Oct. 5 filing had called the governments position Kafkaesque and a direct assault on the authority established by the U.S. Supreme Court during George W. Bushs presidency.
The governments claim that a federal judge does not even have the authority to determine if a U.S. citizen who has been imprisoned for nearly three months wants to challenge his detention is unprecedented, and completely unsupportable, Hafetz said. It not only strips citizens of a basic constitutional right, but it eliminates the important role of the federal courts as a check on actions by the president.
Justice Department civil division attorney Kathryn L. Wyer said the decision of what to do with the detainee is temporary, still underway, and the government is diligently attempting to reach that determination but did not know how long it would take.
The government has said the man surrendered in Syria to rebel Syrian Democratic Forces, and was turned over to the U.S. military on Sept. 14 and held since in military custody in Iraq. Wyer said the detainee has been visited by the International Committee of the Red Cross and could ask that group to contact his family to seek legal help. The government has said it is complying with the Geneva Conventions in not releasing his name.
Wyer warned of far-reaching consequences whenever U.S. forces detain an individual while engaged in active military operations in a foreign country if the court ruled any third party could sue on the detainees behalf in U.S. courts.
Some national security law experts have said that there is agreement the executive branch does not have unreviewable discretion to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens captured on a battlefield, but that the military has some leeway to make a decision.
The key question is how long is too long, and who decides.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 2004 ruled U.S. citizens held as enemy combatants under war legislation are entitled to counsel and the right to challenge the evidence against them before a neutral arbiter.
But then-Justice Sandra Day OConnor wrote in a controlling opinion that that right does not attach at the initial capture but instead only when the determination is made to continue to hold [him].
Chutkan directed both sides to file further arguments on whether the court can directly seek the answer to whether the man wants the ACLU or other private counsel, and whether the government is obligated independently to provide him with an attorney.
The Washington Post reported in October that Justice Department officials did not think they had enough evidence to charge the man, who was questioned first by an interagency interrogation team for intelligence purposes and then by an FBI team seeking enough admissible evidence to bring a case against him. The man refused to talk and demanded a lawyer, the officials said.
U.S. officials told The Post that the man once had ties to the Pacific Northwest but that most of his family and roots are in the Middle East.

PRESS RELEASE – DECEMBER 10 is observed worldwide as Human Rights Day, for it was on that day in 1948 that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (U.D.H.R.) was promulgated by the General Assembly of the United Nations, as a beacon of hope for a world emerging from the atrocities of the Second World War.
As a seminal document, the U.D.H.R. ushered in a period of Universal Human Rights such as the world had never known. As a milestone document, it was declared “as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations”. For the first time in history, everyone everywhere was entitled to enjoy basic human rights.
The U.D.H.R. is on the threshold of its 70th Anniversary, in 2018. Human rights have become a universal language. In fact, one writer describes human rights as “the world's first universal modern ideology”. This is rightly so because respect for human rights knows no boundaries, therefore everyone everywhere in the world is entitled to equality and dignity as human beings, as stated in Articles 1 and 2 of the U.D.H.R.
Article 1: “All human beings are born free in dignity and rights.”
Article 2: “Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.”
In 1966, two historical Covenants which underpin the U.D.H.R. were adopted by the United Nations, namely The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. These two covenants, together with the U.D.H.R., have come to be known as the International Bill of Human Rights.
Since the promulgation of U.D.H.R., the world has seen a plethora of human rights conventions, covenants and declarations, the practical effect of which is the existence today, of a strong body of International Human Rights Law applied by national courts around the world. In addition, for the first time in history, individual citizens whose countries have ratified the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, have been given the opportunity of achieving redress for violation of their human rights by the State by allowing them to petition the United Nations Human Rights Council to seek redress, and thereby resulting in the State having to comply with the human rights standards which are reflected in the International Covenant and its optional protocol.
Regional Human Rights Conventions and Charters have all sprung from the U.D.H.R. For example, the 1954 European Convention on Human Rights, the 1969 American Convention on Human Rights, and closer home CARICOM's Charter of Civil Society 1997.
What of St. Lucia? In practical terms, Saint Lucia shares in this body of International Human Rights Law, and the norms and standards underpinning this law. Commencing where it must, with the Supreme Law of the land, which is the St. Lucia Constitution, therein the articles of the U.D.H.R. have been incorporated into Chapter I of the Constitution which spells out the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms guaranteed to everyone in St. Lucia without exception (even the criminal).
Other United Nations Conventions which have been drafted to give effect to the implementation of the 1948 U.D.H.R., and the two International Covenants of 1966, and which have been adopted and later ratified, deal with specific groups of people, seen as vulnerable to discrimination or oppression and, therefore, requiring special protection by the state. Two examples are the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child signed and acceded to by St. Lucia in 1991 and the important 1979 Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) which St. Lucia acceded to in 1981.
Today, legislation such as the Domestic Violence Act of 1994 and the Family Court are products of St. Lucia signing on to CEDAW. There has been a lot of advocacy and activism in the area of women's human rights in St. Lucia, yet there is still so much violence against women. Consequently, much more needs to be done in the forum of continuing education on women's rights as well as including men in this education campaign.
As we observe December 10 as Human Rights Day, let us reflect on the theme chosen by the United Nations — “Stand Up 4 Human Rights.” Indeed, everyone in St. Lucia must stand up for human rights, because there are many problems such as child abuse, domestic violence, rapes, murder and acts of police brutality, including the still unsolved 2011 murder of 12 citizens (the IMPACS issue and the Shakadan hanging at the Micoud Police Station, whose family members still await justice). Also, lack of adequate access to justice for vulnerable persons, thereby affording them the Right to a Fair Trial and to Equal Protection of the Law as guaranteed in the Constitution, remains a burning issue for human rights advocates.
There is alarm in the society over the murder rate, for indeed murder and violent crimes do raise human rights issues and, of course, the victims require justice. However, rather than blame human rights advocacy for the cause, we must as a people understand that it is the duty of the Government (the State) to protect its citizens from murder and other violent crimes. Investing more in crime-fighting and crime prevention is part of the solution in reversing the trend. In the final analysis, we all have a part to play. The police must be adequately trained but we must all practice respect for the rights of others because we share a common humanity.
St. Lucia as a member State of the United Nations has inherited the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (U.D.H.R.) which is now customary law. The International Instruments flowing from this Declaration must be taken into consideration by public servants, especially the police. One such International Instrument which ought to inform police action in the arrest and investigation of crime is the 1979 United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials.
This International Instrument constitutes the police themselves as defenders of human rights, and so, despite the menace which crime poses and the great threat to our security, we as a nation must ensure that criminals are not brutalized as it is wrong to treat one act of inhumanity (namely one individual committing a crime against another individual) with another inhumane act committed by the police.
In conclusion, the U.D.H.R. has enabled people the world over to enjoy 69 years of Universal Human Rights. As we embark on its 70th anniversary, December 10 2018, the gains of those years must be protected by all nations and all peoples. We in St. Lucia, as part of the family of democratic nations must, through education, embrace a culture of human rights which is the foundation of peace and democracy. We must all make the human rights values of respect, fairness, dignity, equality and tolerance part of our lives, let these values inform our actions towards one another. Above all, let Government be our model. In the words of the Preamble of the Declaration (U.D.H.R.): “Every individual and every organ of society shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms.”
On the eve of the 70th anniversary of the U.D.H.R., as we look ahead, the world community faces new challenges which threaten to erode the gains made. Individual demands are being made for rights which are not fundamental and which were not perceived in the Declaration (U.D.H.R) of 1948. Those demands seem to usher in a “new generation” of rights. Facing this challenge requires fortitude so as to enable a balance to be struck between maintaining the moral integrity of the society and the demand for new individual rights. One example of which is the right to same-sex marriage, the clarion call of the LGBT community, legalized in the U.S.A and other developed countries. Another area of “new generation rights” is that of environmental rights. Here, too, it is important also that a balance be struck between a people's right to development and environmental rights protection.
On this December 10, 2017, in observance of Human Rights Day and in keeping with the theme “#STAND UP 4 HUMAN RIGHTS”, a call is made to all St. Lucians, especially young people, to become champions of human rights by joining human rights organizations, so that as citizens, we can work in partnership with Government to ensure to all St. Lucians their fullest enjoyment of human rights, civil, political, social, economic and cultural which are interdependent and indivisible.
In the sphere of promotion and observance of human rights and in recognition of the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948–2018), Government is urged to consider the establishment of National Human Rights Commission mentioned in the Report of the Commission on Constitutional Reform. This is a necessary step considering the dysfunctional justice system which impacts negatively on the dispensation of justice. In addition, such a Commission will ensure the reform of those laws in St. Lucia, which currently conflict with International Human Rights Conventions ratified by St. Lucia.
Let us all put this year's theme into action: “#STAND UP 4 HUMAN RIGHTS” and take time on December 10 to reflect on the human rights values of peace, justice, freedom and equality.

KARACHI - Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Pakistan chief Senator Sirajul Haq said on Sunday that if the United Nation's Security Council (UNSC) could not protect 1.2 billion Muslims then the latter should quit the so-called UN.
He also urged Islamic countries to establish a mutual world market, mutual educational syllabus and a joint force.
Addressing Umaat-e-Rasool (SAW) rally, organised by JI, Karachi to express solidarity with the oppressed Muslims of Myanmar and Aleppo (Syria), the JI leader accused the UN of practicing dual standards and hypocrisy.
He lamented that the so-called international institutions did not act to lessen the plight of innocent Muslims. “They only take action when they deem it fit or when the interests of global powers are at stake,” he said, and added, “They raise their voice even for animals, but do not take any concrete step to help the oppressed Muslims.”
Tens of Thousands of people, belonging to various walks of life from across the city, participated in the march. A large number of seminary and college students also attended the rally. The participants, carrying placards and banners, were chanting slogans against the hypocrisy of the Muslim rulers as well as apathy of global powers.
Scores of women and children were also present on the occasion. Siraj brought home the fact that the march was an expression of solidarity with the oppressed Muslims across the world, particularly of Kashmir, Myanmar and Aleppo.
He shed light on the plight of Muslim women and children in Aleppo, who, he said, were being subjected to rape, physical and mental torture and executions. He expressed deep sorrow over the silence of Muslim leaders over the issue.
The JI chief said that the presence of such a large number of people in the march proved that the Ummah was still alive. He opined that Pakistan should play an active role against these brutalities.
“Being a JI chief, I urge the government of Pakistan to take steps in this regard,” he added.
He pointed out that JI had always raised its voice over the issues confronting the Muslims across the world. “If the Ummah had a single Slahuddin Ayubi, the situation would have been better,” he wished.
However, Siraj hailed the active role played by Turkey to highlight the issues confronting the Muslims across the world.
Talking about the situation on the country's eastern border, the JI chief said that blocking of river waters flowing into Pakistan would be a declaration of war against the country.
He said that although the rulers of Pakistan were weak, but the nation was stronger.
He predicted that 2017 would be the year of struggle for a peaceful Islamic revolution.
“JI, if came to power, would ensure social justice in the society,” he said, and added, “JI is determined to transform the country into a clean, green, and peaceful Islamic republic.”
Siraj was of the view that the current global scenario demanded active role from Pakistan in affairs of the region as well as the whole world.
JI Sindh chief Dr Merajul Huda Siddiqui, in his address, regretted that differences among Muslims were allowing the Buddhists to carry out persecution of Muslims in Myanmar with impunity.
He also blasted the so-called liberal segments for not highlighting the issues of Muslims in Myanmar and Syria.
He vowed to get the Ummah united. “Despite UN's criminal silence, we are thankful to Turkey, France and other Western countries who raised their voice for the people of Syria and Myanmar,” Siddiqui added.
Addressing the participants JI Karachi chief Engineer Hafiz Naeemur Rahman said that about 4 million Muslims in Syria had been compelled to flee. "No one cares for them, no one talks for them. Unfortunately the Arab countries are also purposefully ignoring these migrants," he said, adding that the situation had put a question mark over Pakistani nation's position.
He was of the view that Karachi had always represented the Ummah. “The march demands the Islamic block in the world to mend its ways and play its due role in resolving the issues pertaining to Muslims,” he said, and warned the leaders of Islamic countries of overwhelming reaction from within their own countries if they did not pay heed to the aspirations of Muslims.
He demanded restoration of Islamic state of Rohangia, which had fallen when the British had invaded Myanmar.
He also stressed the need for forming a global forum to ensure protection of Muslims across the world
NAACP: Blatant Racism On Display In Charlottesville Is Disgusting
David Greene talks to Derrick Johnson, interim president and CEO of the NAACP, about Saturday's violence in Charlottesville, Va. He says President Trump gives permission for hate to thrive.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
We're spending much of this morning talking about the racist violence over the weekend in Charlottesville, Va. President Trump condemned hatred, quote, "on many sides." And many felt the president was letting the extremist groups in Virginia off the hook. Fighting racism is at the core of the NAACP. And its interim president and CEO, Derrick Johnson, is speaking out. He tweeted on Saturday, when Trump gives permission for hate to thrive, this is what happens. Sick. Derrick Johnson joins me on the line from Tunica, Miss. Good morning.
DERRICK JOHNSON: Good morning. How are you today?
GREENE: I'm good. Thanks for taking the time for us this morning. Your tweet does not leave much to the imagination. You believe the president was, in some way, responsible for growing racism in the country today. Why is that?
JOHNSON: Well, if you look at his campaign rhetoric, if you look at his cabinet appointments, if you look at his unwillingness to wholly denounce what has taken place, it leaves little room for your - for our understanding of where he stands when it comes to the question of race and racial hatred. We shouldn't have a president - we shouldn't have a country that tolerates this type of situation. We have lived through this. We should've learned from our history. And there's no reason for us to repeat this history again.
GREENE: Is the White House getting it right in your mind now? We've heard from Vice President Pence. The president's daughter tweeted specifically, pointing to the KKK and these groups. Are you satisfied now that they're reacting in a way that you think is appropriate?
JOHNSON: Well you still have individuals within the Cabinet, who are advisers, who sit there to provide the president with information - Steve Bannon and others. The problem with this presidency is its lack of understanding that the United States is inclusive of many, many individuals - African-Americans, Latinos - the rhetoric around building a wall. All of this leads to a culture of intolerance. And we should not stand idly by as an association, as citizens and accept the rhetoric we've been hearing over the last seven months during this presidency.
GREENE: I want to ask you about something Vice President Pence said yesterday. He said many in the media are spending an awful lot of time focusing on what the president said instead of actually criticizing those who brought hatred and violence to the streets of Charlottesville. Does he have a point there that you might agree with? - that maybe it's worth focusing more on dealing with the central problems and not so much the president's words.
JOHNSON: This is the president of the United States. He's the chief spokesman for this country. And if this president, through both his actions and his statements, is not willing to fully understand the gravity of what's taking place in this country, what took place in Charlottesville, then that's a problem. And we should focus on not only the words but the action of the chief executive officer of this country. It's vitally important.
GREENE: You know, President Obama liked to quote one of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s favorite sayings - the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice. Could the torch-bearing crowds with racist chants be a last gasp from a dying ideology?
JOHNSON: Well, there's last gasp or the beginning of a new norm. An individual died Saturday. And so that should not be tolerated. If it is towards the end of the arc, let's accelerate the arc and allow for this country to be the country it should be, not the country it used to be.
GREENE: That is the NAACP's interim president, Derrick Johnson, joining us this morning from Mississippi. Thanks for the time.
JOHNSON: Thank you for the opportunity.

CLAIM
Al Gore predicted that Earth's “ice caps” will melt away by 2014.
Mixture
RATING
Mixture
WHAT'S TRUE
In the late 2000s, Al Gore made a series of high-profile statements suggesting the possibility that Arctic sea ice could be completely gone during the summer by around 2013 or 2014.
WHAT'S FALSE
Gore did not himself make these predictions but said (in some cases erroneously) that others had; Gore never referred to a year-long lack of ice for both poles, but instead largely referenced Arctic sea ice in the summer.
ORIGIN
In the years 2007, 2008, and 2009, Al Gore made statements about the possibility of a complete lack of summer sea ice in the Arctic by as early as 2013. While Gore attributed these predictions to scientists, they stemmed from a selective reading of aggressive estimates regarding future melting. The comments became a popular talking point for human-caused climate change deniers in 2014 and onward when the predictions, which in some cases were overstated, did not pan out.
On 10 December 2007, in his Nobel prize acceptance speech, Gore said:
Last September 21, as the Northern Hemisphere tilted away from the sun, scientists reported with unprecedented distress that the North Polar ice cap is “falling off a cliff.” One study estimated that it could be completely gone during summer in less than 22 years. Another new study, to be presented by U.S. Navy researchers later this week, warns it could happen in as little as 7 years.
Here, Gore refers to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) announcement and two different climate studies, one of which became the source for his most aggressive statements. On 21 September, NOAA did announce that sea ice had hit its lowest recorded point in history.
The second, more aggressive estimate for when summer sea ice will disappear in the Arctic comes from a conference talk at the 2007 American Geophysical Fall Meeting — which was done by researchers associated with the Naval Postgraduate School, and was presented later that week. The BBC reported that the study did make the prediction that Gore claimed:
Scientists in the US have presented one of the most dramatic forecasts yet for the disappearance of Arctic sea ice. Their latest modelling studies indicate northern polar waters could be ice-free in summers within just 5-6 years. Professor Wieslaw Maslowski told an American Geophysical Union meeting that previous projections had underestimated the processes now driving ice loss.
The article also noted that Maslowski's group, frequently cited by Gore, often makes predictions that are more aggressive than their peers:
Professor Maslowski's group, which includes co-workers at NASA and the Institute of Oceanology, Polish Academy of Sciences (PAS), is well known for producing modelled dates that are in advance of other teams.
On 13 December 2008, Gore appears to have made a similarly flawed statement while speaking at the opening of a German natural history museum. Though transcripts and clear audio are hard to find, one video of the event documents Gore saying that “The entire North polar ice cap may well be completely gone in 5 years.” Given the dates presented, it is likely that Gore was once again referring to Maslowski's data. Unless he preceded his statement with some qualification not captured by the video, his statement either intentionally or accidentally neglected to mention that this prediction, aggressive as it was, concerned only summer sea ice.
On 14 December 2009, during a speech at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, Gore cited newer research from the same group:
These figures are fresh. Some of the models suggest to Dr [Wieslav] Maslowski that there is a 75 per cent chance that the entire north polar ice cap, during the summer months, could be completely ice-free within five to seven years.
That statement put Gore in hot water when Maslowski told The Times of London that his data did not allow for such a prediction:
“It's unclear to me how this figure was arrived at,” Dr Maslowski said. “I would never try to estimate likelihood at anything as exact as this.” Mr Gore's office later admitted that the 75 per cent figure was one used by Dr Maslowksi as a “ballpark figure” several years ago in a conversation with Mr Gore.
The claim that Gore “predicted” an ice-free Arctic in 2014 is a simplification of these events. However, Gore is definitely guilty, in these cases, of cherry picking science or playing loose with the details of that science.
Gore's statements gained the most viral attention in 2014 and 2015, both because these were years in which Gore's statements implied an ice-free summer in the Arctic and because those years had relatively more arctic sea ice than preceding years.
From a broad perspective, however, summer sea ice in the Arctic has, in fact, been declining at faster rates relative to 20th century, and the year 2016 has tied with the year 2007 (the year highlighted by Gore in his Nobel speech) for the second least Arctic summer sea ice on record (the lowest recorded sea ice extent occurred in 2012).
While the disappearance of summer sea ice is difficult to predict, a 2013 review of different approaches (including Maslowski's) summarized the range of various predictions for the first ice-free summer in the Arctic:
We have investigated three approaches to predicting 21st century summer Arctic sea ice loss as represented by trendsetters, stochasters, and modelers [three quantitative approaches used to make predictions]. At present, it is not possible to completely choose one approach over another as all approaches have strengths and weaknesses. […] Time horizons for summer sea ice loss of these three approaches turns out to be roughly 2020, 2030, and 2040 respectively for trendsetters, stochasters, and modelers. […] It is reasonable to conclude that Arctic sea ice loss is very likely to occur in the ﬁrst rather than the second half of the 21st century, with a possibility of loss within a decade or two.
Arctic sea ice is, without question, on a declining trend, but Gore definitely erred in his use of preliminary projections and misrepresentations of research. Because Gore himself did not claim to have made these predictions, however, and because his statements applied specifically to summer sea ice in the Arctic, we rate the claim that Gore “predicted the ice caps will melt by 2014” as a mixture.

A Russian journalist who was reportedly gunned down in Ukraine's capital strolled into a news conference that authorities called Wednesday to discuss the investigation of his death, revealing that the slaying had been staged to foil an alleged Kremlin hit plot.
"I'm still alive," Arkady Babchenko, 41, told startled fellow reporters at the news conference held less than 24 hours after police reported he had been shot and killed at his Kiev apartment building.
Ukrainian police said Tuesday that Babchenko, a strong critic of the Kremlin, was shot multiple times in the back Tuesday and found bleeding there by his wife. Authorities said they suspected he was killed because of his work.
Babchenko apologized to his wife, who he said was not briefed on the scheme in advance, "for the hell she had to go through in the past two days. There was no choice there, either."

Neither he nor Vasyl Gritsak, head of the Ukrainian Security Service, provided details of how they staged Babchenko's injuries or made his wife believe he was dead.
The movie-like twist came as Gritsak convened the news conference to announce that the security agency and the police had solved Babchenko's reported slaying. He then confused everyone there by inviting the supposed slaying into the room.
To applause and gasps, Babchenko took the floor and apologized to the friends and family who mourned for him and were unaware of the plan.
"I'm still alive," he said. "I know that sickening feeling when you bury a colleague. I'm sorry you had to go through this but there was no other way."
Before ushering Babchenko into the room, Gritsak said investigators had identified a Ukrainian citizen who allegedly was paid $40,000 by the Russian security service to organize and carry out the hit. The unidentified Ukrainian man in turn allegedly hired an acquaintance to be the gunman, Gritsak said.
The man allegedly paid to organize Banchenko's killing was detained Wednesday, he said, showing a video of the arrest.
Gritsak said killing Babchenko was part of a larger alleged plot by Russian security services. The Ukrainian man was also supposed to procure large quantities of weapons and explosives, including 300 AK-47 rifles and "hundreds of kilos of explosives," to perpetrate acts of terror in Ukraine, he said.
Babchenko said he was not allowed to go into the details of the sting operation, but said Ukrainian law enforcement had been aware of a contract on his head for two months. He said he was approached by the Ukrainian Security Service, the SBU, a month ago.
"The important thing is my life has been saved and other, bigger terrorist attacks have been thwarted," he said.
Babchenko, one of Russia's best-known war reporters, fled the country in February 2017 after receiving death threats. He spoke and wrote about leaving the country because of the threats against him and his family. He said his home address was published online and the threats he received were made by phone, email and social media.
Ilya Ponomarev, a former Russian lawmaker who also moved to Ukraine, said Babchenko continued being threatened after he settled last fall in Kiev, where he worked as a host for the Crimean Tatar TV station. Babchenko did not take the intimidation too seriously, Ponomarev said Wednesday before the fact that the slaying was staged came out.
Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for separatist insurgents in eastern Ukraine were topics on which the journalist was scathingly critical of the Kremlin.
Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko lashed out Wednesday at Ukrainian politicians and civil groups who accused the government following Babchenko's faked assassination of allowing contract killings to happen.
A stunt person was killed on the set of “Deadpool 2” Monday morning after a trick involving a motorcycle went wrong.
The sequel to “Deadpool” is currently filming in Vancouver. Production began in late June.
“Vancouver Police can confirm that a female stunt driver has died on the set of ‘Deadpool' during a stunt on a motorcycle,” the Vancouver PD said in a statement.
A spokesman for Fox did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
According to Ben Miljure, a reporter with local news station CTV Vancouver, the stuntwoman was carried onto an Advanced Life Support ambulance. The vehicle stayed at the scene for about 45 minutes, and then drove off without turning on its lights or sirens.
The news follows another stunt accident reported by TMZ on Sunday when Tom Cruise crashed into a wall while filming “Mission: Impossible 6,” and appeared to walk away with a limp. The extent of his injuries are currently unknown.

Minhas Sask Ventures Inc. announced on Monday that they will be building a new distillery and winery in Regina.
The multi-million dollar project includes construction of a state-of-the-art building for the new distillery and winery as well as a public tasting room, off sales retail and a gift shop.
The distillery will be built at 444 McLeod Street in Regina and it will be the largest distillery and winery in Saskatchewan.
The new facility will employ 20 people starting in mid-January and will produce a wide variety of products such as spirits, liqueurs, wines and ready to drink cocktails.
Minhas is saying there are two main reasons for doing business in Regina, great business-friendly environment promoted by the Saskatchewan Government and a desire to contribute to their Saskatchewan economy by creating manufacturing jobs.
In Saskatchewan's 112 years, almost all the distillery and wine products sold in the province have been imported from the rest of the country and the world. This new facility will try and reverse the flow by replacing the shipments from outside the province with Saskatchewan packaged products, while also exporting Saskatchewan packaged products to Alberta, Montana and California.
Minhas has already purchased a variety of world class high tech equipment for this project from the Netherlands, Bulgaria, USA, China and Saskatchewan.
Climate versus weather: Find out the difference on Dec. 12 at the Menlo Park Library
Climate and weather — the two are so often confused. A meteorologist from the National Weather Service will be at the Menlo Park Library to explain the distinctions and to answer questions on Tuesday, Dec. 12 from 6:30 to 8:00 pm.
The National Weather Service is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (a division of the Department of Commerce) with a network of 122 local weather forecast offices and numerous regional centers that keep tabs around the clock on weather, fire, river, coast and ocean conditions.
NWS forecasters rely on a network of radars, satellites, ocean buoys, weather balloons, other observations, and supercomputers to provide timely, accurate, and reliable forecasts. They also issue critical watches and warnings before extreme weather strikes.

Iran Focus
London, 15 Feb - The Iranian Regime is running a terrorist training organisation, which includes at least 14 camps across Iran, according to the Iranian Resistance.
On Tuesday morning, the American branch of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) held a press conference on the revelations from its Washington DC office.
Alireza Jafarzadeh, the Deputy Director of the US Representative Office of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, told journalists that the Iranian Regime (and its own terror squad, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)) was training hundreds of terrorists from across the middle-east every month.
This horrifying information was unearthed by the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK) and their covert operatives within Iran. It further confirms the statement by Defence Secretary James Mattis at the start of the month, that Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism.
It revealed the names of IRGC commanders who are directly involved with this terror training, including:
• Colonel Ali Mohammad
• Brigadier General Khosrow Orouj
• Qassem Soleimani
• Brigadier General Rahimi
• Ebrahimi
• Mowlaee
• Khavari
Colonel Bakhtiari
• Massih Mohammadi
• Seyyed Mostafa Hosseini
• Colonel Hosseini Moqaddam
• Colonel Ramky
• Brigadier General Seyyed Shafi Shafiee
The Regime lets their Quds force run the terror training camps in order to distance themselves from the Quds' terrorism but Jafarzadeh warns that there is no distance between the Regime, the IRGC and the Quds force.
In fact, in November 2016, Brigadier General Orouj, confirmed the Regime's knowledge of the camps in an interview.
He said: “I was in charge of training for the Quds Force, and later took charge of training of the Quds Special Forces, working with them round-the-clock, going back and forth to Lebanon. … When Khamenei visited the Quds Force, the only unit that he applauded was that same training unit.”
The press conference also revealed the locations of the terror camps, eight of which are in Tehran. The others are in Mashhad, Gheshm, Amel, Semnan, Ahvaz, and Abadan. These are only the ones that the NCRI has received substantial intelligence on and there are more suspected locations across Iran
Terror trainees are sorted by their nationality and the terror training course they are taking, but all terrorists must first complete a one-week body building course.
There are two distinct types of training:
• Basic - a 45-day crash course, designed for mercenaries who are dispatched to create further destruction in the Syrian Civil War, on behalf of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad
• Intense- a 9 to 12-month course, designed for those who are to be inducted into the IRGC's more brutal arm, the Quds force. Intense training types include:
o Theoretical Training- how to promote fundamentalism and terrorism
o Urban Training – vehicle manoeuvring training
o Survival Training - how to survive under harsh conditions in the wild
o Practical Missile Training
o Commando Training
o Heavy Weapons Training- how to use drones, rockets, and heavy weapons
o Paratrooper training
o VIP Security training
o Diving and Marine Training
Following training, terrorists from countries when Iran is fighting (either openly or secretly), will be sent to the front lines. At present, this includes Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan and Lebanon.
In countries where Iran is not involved in heavy warfare (like Bahrain and Kuwait), the terrorists will form cells designed to destabilise the government there.
Jafarzadeh took part in a press conference after his address, in which he noted that there was bipartisan support for the Iranian Resistance within the US Congress and that he expected Democrats and Republicans alike to get behind listing the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organisation.
The NCRI have given their information on these terror camps to the Department of Justice for further investigation.

Fort Worth, Texas — A capital murder charge has been dismissed against a North Texas man in the death of his 2-year-old daughter, after prosecutors learned her then-5-year-old brother admitted causing her death.
Anthony Michael Sanders was accused of smothering his daughter, Ellie Mae, at their home in the Fort Worth suburb of Watauga in 2015. Investigators believed Sanders held his hand over her mouth out of anger for her interrupting his computer games.
Jailed since April 2016, Sanders denied responsibility. He said he found his daughter not breathing after his son reported she wouldn't wake up.
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports prosecutors recently learned the boy told his mother he was responsible. Investigators say the boy cried as he told them he accidentally rolled a heavy pillow onto his sister's face while they played and it was too heavy for him to move.

ISLAMABAD, Oct 6 (APP): A high level meeting held here on
Friday over the issue of India's case in International Court
of Justice (ICJ) over Indian RAW officer Commander Kulbhushan
Jadhav, who has been sentenced to death by a military court.
The meeting was held at Attorney General Office which was
attended among other by Secretary Foreign Affair Tahmina
Janjua, Secretary Law Karamatullah Niazi, Secretary
Interior Arshad Mirza and other relevant agencies, sources said.
Jadhav, a RAW officer, was arrested during a
counter-intelligence raid in Balochistan in March 2016, who had
confessed to being a spy for India's Research and Analysis Wing
(RAW) and involvement in terrorism in the country.
The failure of the US' longest and most frustrating war, now in its 16th year, has forced Kabul to mull training and arming 20,000 civilians to fight the Taliban, with the prospects of victory more tenuous today than at any point since the US military invasion in 2001.
The new fighters would come under the command of the Afghan army which is already demoralised by killings and desertions while struggling to beat back the insurgents.
The proposed force will be recruited from the locals and used to fill the gaps, as per Afghan officials.
The proposal was inevitable as the Taliban have been gaining ground and Islamic State is expanding its footprint; and as of February this year, approximately 60 percent of Afghanistan's 407 districts are under the government's control, as per SIGAR, the US watchdog agency.
Also, recently the Afghan government has ordered to nearly double the country's elite fighting force from 17,000 showing that the victory in the US war against Afghan Taliban is not yet in sight in the country that is faced with violence at record levels, a dysfunctional government plagued by corruption, and a police and army riddled with illiteracy and dependent on coalition support despite billions of dollars being poured into creating an Afghan army and police force capable of fighting the insurgents on their own.
The notion of the US and its 39-member coalition's helplessness in the Afghan war before the Taliban and other militants is also strengthened by various American officials' statements on the simmering issue.
There have been 3,407 coalition deaths in Afghanistan as of 1 October 2015 in the on-going coalition operations since 2001.
The total casualties also omit the 62 Spanish soldiers who died while returning from Afghanistan when their plane crashed in Turkey.
During the first five years of the war, the vast majority of coalition deaths were American, but between 2006 and 2011, a significant proportion were amongst other nations, particularly the United Kingdom and Canada which have been assigned responsibility for the flashpoint provinces of Helmand and Kandahar, respectively.
A total of 70 Western coalition soldiers involved in the execution of Operation Enduring Freedom were killed in 2002; 58 in 2003; 60 in 2004; 131 in 2005; 191 in 2006; 232 in 2007; 295 in 2008; 521 in 2009; 711 in 2010; 566 in 2011; 402 in 2012; 161 in 2013; 55 in 2014; 22 in 2015; 14 in 2016 and 11 in 2017 with total fatalities of 2,403 while most of the deceased were American soldiers.
In the execution of Operation Enduring Freedom, as many as 12 US troops were killed in 2001; 49 in 2002; 48 in 2003; 52 in 2004; 99 in 2005; 98 in 2006; 117 in 2007; 155 in 2008; 317 in 2009; 499 in 2010; 418 in 2011; 310 in 2012; 127 in 2013; 55 in 2014; 22 in 2015; 14 in 2016; and 11 in 2017 so far with a total of 2403 casualties.
In 2009, there were 7,228 improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in Afghanistan, a 120% increase over 2008, and a record for the war.
Of the 512 foreign soldiers killed in 2009, 448 were killed in action.
280 of those were killed by IEDs.
In 2010, IED attacks in Afghanistan wounded 3,366 U.
S.
soldiers, which is nearly 60% of the total IED-wounded since the start of the war.
Of the 711 foreign soldiers killed in 2010, 630 were killed in action.
368 of those were killed by IEDs, which is around 36% of the total IED-killed since the start of the war to date.
The insurgents planted 14,661 IEDs in 2010, a 62% increase over the previous year.
In the wake of such a critical and disastrous situation, U.
S.
commanding general in Afghanistan John “Mick” Nicholson Jr.
, who is the 12th U.
S.
commander since the war began, in his recent Senate testimony, called for several thousand more U.
S.
troops to break the “stalemate”.
He suggested that those troops would serve mainly as advisers and trainers to Afghan forces, facilitating what he labelled “hold-fight-disrupt” operations.
Nicholson was of the view that Afghanistan is a “petri dish” in which terrorist “strands” are “converging” to create a “stalemate” that is weakening America's “enduring CT platform,” which could lead to terrorist attacks on the “homeland.
”
General Nicholson also mentioned in his testimony that Afghanistan is a different kind of war, a fourth-generation war fought in a “grey zone”; a mish-mash of low-intensity and asymmetric conflicts, involving non-state actors, worsened by the meddling of foreign powers like Pakistan, Iran, and Russia.
Likewise, Captain Waddell, who is a former infantry officer and was previously stationed in Sangin, Afghanistan, with 3d Bn, 7th Marines, in 2010 and 2011, recently wrote a scathing editorial on a Marine Corp Gazette saying, “It is time that we, as professional military officers, accept the fact that we lost the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
” He also outlined some of very serious problems with the US Marine Corp.
In the same way, responding to the US president's astonishment in a recent meeting held at Pentagon when he pointed to maps showing the Taliban gaining ground, Defense Secretary James Mattis said the U.
S.
is losing because it doesn't have the strategy it needs.
” The Pentagon all but concedes that there just aren't any good ideas anymore on how to escape from Afghanistan with anything resembling a win.
In an interview with PBS News, former CIA Director David Petraeus, who also oversaw U.
S.
forces in Afghanistan and Iraq during his military career, admitted that the 16-year war in Afghanistan is not going to end any time soon.
“This is a generational struggle.
This is not something that is going to be won in a few years.
We're not going to take a hill, plant a flag and go home to a victory parade,” he said.
Also President Donald Trump has termed the conflict “a complete and total disaster” and encouraged the US to “get out of Afghanistan.
We've wasted billions and billions of dollars and more importantly thousands of lives.
” He further said, “Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there.
” Thus, Washington should “get out of Afghanistan.
” In 2015, he declared “We made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place.
We had real brilliant thinkers that didn't know what the hell they were doing.
” He asked, “At some point, are they going to be there for the next 200 years.
”
In the longest and most discouraging war, the US has faced terrifying failures despite the spending of over $841 billion on the conflict and casualties of thousands of troops and still there is no end in sight.

Aug 11, 2017; Charlotte, NC, USA; Jordan Spieth tees off on the second hole during the second round of the 2017 PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club. Mandatory Credit: Rob Schumacher-USA TODAY Sports/files
CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Jordan Spieth acknowledged after the second round of the PGA Championship that it will take some "crazy stuff" for him to complete the career grand slam on Sunday.
After speaking so positively ahead of the final major of the year, Spieth's challenge never left the launch pad over the first 36 holes at Quail Hollow.
Eleven strokes behind at three-over 145, he will almost certainly have to wait another year to have an opportunity to complete the grand slam of all four modern majors.
His putting let him down in the first round, while on Friday he played too conservatively down the stretch in relatively easy late-afternoon conditions, after rain had taken the sting out of the greens.
"I kind of accept the fact that I'm essentially out of this tournament pending some form of crazy stuff the next couple of days," he said after a one-birdie 73.
"I'm sure going to give it a try."
He was frustrated with himself for playing away from danger over the final stretch of holes where water comes into play.
"I'm a little upset at the bailing out I did on a couple of shots. Just no reason to bail out on those at this point in the position I was in."
Asked if he had a score in mind over the weekend, he said "54 would be nice" before adding more seriously that he would just go as low as he could.
Pre-tournament favourite Rory McIlroy is also all but out of contention, 10 strokes behind after being on the harder side of the draw, late on Thursday and early Friday, before the rain.
"I feel like I'm still right there in the tournament," he said, speaking before Hideki Matsuyama had carded 64 to join Kevin Kisner in the lead at eight-under.
McIlroy is a two-time winner at Quail Hollow.

PanARMENIAN.Net - The same week that Azerbaijan held its ersatz presidential election, a youth-led, non-violent protest movement was emerging in neighboring Armenia to bring down a prime minister that embodied Armenia's entrenched political elite.
It is unlikely that Azerbaijan can hold back the tide that brought tens of thousands into the streets in Armenia in 2018 and to join Georgia's Rose Revolution in 2003, The Hill says in an article, suggesting that Azerbaijan's centennial celebrations seek to mask the repressive reality in the country.
On Monday, the Republic of Azerbaijan celebrated 100 years of independence from the Russian Empire that collapsed following the Russian Revolution of 1917.
For years, the country's criminal justice system has punished opposition leaders, youth activists, and independent journalists with trumped-up charges of drug use, tax evasion, and “hooliganism," the article says.
President Ilham Aliyev directs retribution against his opponents from behind the scenes and subsequently basks in fawning media coverage of his occasional pardons of some political prisoners, it adds.
The feature, authored by Rep. Cris Smith, suggests that by failing to respect the basic rights and dignity of its people, Azerbaijan becomes a long-term security liability.
"As Azerbaijan marks 100 years of independence, the U.S. must urge the government to rediscover the state's original democratic roots and reestablish it for a new century, rooted in respect for human rights and liberty," Smith says.
"Whether or not the government seizes this opportunity, the United States ought to stand in solidarity with the people of Azerbaijan, whose desires for dignity and justice will not be indefinitely denied."
Jan. 6, 1994, continues to be known as the day one of the biggest sports scandals in American history took place. Olympians Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan were preparing for their second Games together when Kerrigan was attacked — but was Harding involved? She holds onto her innocence to this day. Multiple documentaries have been made on the incident, and now Margot Robbie will star in Hollywood's big-budget film I, Tonya, set to hit cinemas on Feb. 15. The scandal occurred over 20 years ago, yet the movie offers a new reason to revisit the case. In a time when some women choose to tear each other down for the sake of their own careers and relationships, the movie will surely open a fresh perspective.
Their Relationship
Harding was the first American woman to land a triple axel (the name just sounds difficult in itself) in the 1991 US Figure Skating Championships. She ended up getting a perfect score and won first place. Kerrigan received bronze. The two had competed against one another in the 1992 Olympics in Albertville, France, where Kerrigan took home bronze and Harding followed in fourth. Their relationship extended beyond healthy competition. Sure, they were both gunning for the top spot, but it seemed to stretch beyond that.
Both ladies were making big names for themselves, but Kerrigan had more sponsorships: Campbell's, Seiko, Revlon, and Reebok. Her overall persona seemed to win over the public more, even if Harding arguably had a slight skating advantage.
The Incident
Harding and Kerrigan were practicing for the US Women's Championships in Detroit, Michigan, on that January day. The championship was set for the following day and would decide who qualified to move onto the 1994 Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway. That night, before the qualifying skate, Kerrigan was walking off the ice after practicing when she was struck in the right knee with a baton. The assaulter was a man hired by Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly.
The moments before and after the attack were caught on tape. We see Kerrigan on the ground crying and screaming, "Why?!" In between shrieks and sobs, she described the object she was struck with as "some hard, hard black stick." Kerrigan was hit on her right kneecap, which was her landing leg on the ice.
The doctor who examined Kerrigan after the attack, Dr. Steven Plomaritis, told The New York Times, "He [the attacker] was clearly trying to debilitate her." Luckily, there was no fracture, but she did suffer from a bruise, limp, and severe swelling. Would Kerrigan be able to skate her two-and-a-half-minute routine? After all, the qualifying round was the very next day. Plomaritis told the Times that it wouldn't hurt for her to skate, on a medical level. But could she stand the pain? Harding went on to skate into first place that next day.
Before the Games even started, the man who struck Kerrigan, Gillooly, and two other men associated with the attack were sentenced to prison. However, they made it known that Harding knew about the attack beforehand. But even today, she stands by the fact that she did not know about it or have involvement in it.
The US Olympic Committee wanted to disqualify Harding from competing. But when she came back with a $25 million lawsuit, they allowed her to go for the title. If you're on Kerrigan's side, maybe it's a good thing Harding was allowed to compete. Kerrigan skated in her bright yellow Vera Wang outfit with grace and took home the silver medal. Harding, on the other hand, almost didn't skate at all since one her laces broke before her turn. She started to cry and the judges allowed her to skate a little later on. Harding took eighth place.
The Aftermath
Harding's career was as good as over, and she still says that she didn't know about the attack prior to it happening. However, she did admit in court that she found out shortly after it was carried out. In March 1994, Harding pleaded guilty to hindering the investigation. She was sentenced to probation, community service, and a fine. About six months after the attack, the US Figure Skating Association decided to strip Harding of her 1994 national championship. In addition, she couldn't skate in any event sponsored by the US Figure Skating Championships in any capacity. Now, it was really over.
"By a preponderance of the evidence, the five members of the panel concluded that she had prior knowledge and was involved prior to the incident," William Hybl, the hearing panel chairman, said in a telephone interview to The Washington Post. "This is based on civil standards, not criminal standards."
Kerrigan retired from active competition. However, she continued to show her moves in a variety of ice skating shows. In 2006, she was on Fox's Skating With Celebrities, and she even was in Blades of Glory with Will Ferrell. She also competed on Dancing With the Stars during its 24th season.
Will we ever truly know Harding's involvement or lack thereof in Kerrigan's attack? Probably not. Not for certain, anyway. But we're looking forward to seeing how the two women are depicted in I, Tonya later this year!
SPRINGFIELD - Two Springfield men are being held by federal authorities after they were arrested Friday on charges they distributed crack cocaine.
Federal prosecutors said in a release that 24-year-old Donovan Coombs-Thompson and Kayvon Lovejoy, 26, were the subjects of indictments unsealed Friday.
Coombs-Thompson was charged with two counts of distribution of cocaine base, while Lovejoy was charged with two counts of distribution of crack cocaine.
The charge of distribution of cocaine base carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release and a fine of $1 million. Lovejoy faces a potential 30 years in federal prison, six years of supervised release and a $1 million fine.
Both men are being held following an appearance in federal court in Springfield.
Peterborough United manager Grant McCann admitted his side got exactly what they deserved from a very poor display in today's (February 3) League One fixture with Southend at the ABAX Stadium.
The visitor, who had lost 10 of their previous 14 away matches in the League, claimed the points with an early penalty. McCann insisted his side had two Andrew Hughes ‘goals' wrongly ruled out for offside, but still accepted Southend were worthy winners.

Other results weren't too bad for Posh who remain eighth, but five points outside the play-off places. They have two games in hand on sixth-placed Bradford City who lost for the sixth straight game today.
McCann started with a positive 4-4-2 formation which included a debut for transfer deadline day signing Omar Bogle.
“We were very, very poor from start to finish,” McCann added. “Southend overpowered us all over the pitch. They had more legs, they had more energy and they had more nous. We couldn't cope with them physically.
“We gave them a dreadful goal with a sloppy piece of play from a throw-in and we rarely looked like getting back on terms. There was no urgency about our passing. It was too slow. We were too lacklustre in everything we did and we deserved to lose.

“We did have two perfectly good goals disallowed though. I've watched them back and Andrew is a yard onside for the first one and probably level for the second one. It was a poor day for the officials as well. It's always a horror show for us when this referee (Dean Whitestone) turns up.
“People want us to play 4-4-2, but to do that you need to have legs in midfield and you need the wingers to work hard, but we hardly picked up a second ball all game and I can only remember one time when Chris Forrester passed the ball forward and he almost got Omar through on goal.
“The two midfielder (Forrester and Anthony Grant) need to buck their ideas up. Michael Doughty was knocking on the door to play today, but fell ill.
“It was very disappointing. It seems every time we have a chance to make up some ground we mess it up. We need to forget about the games in hand we have and the position we are in, and just concentrate on producing a performance in the next one.
The assistant referee rules out a last-gasp goal for Posh against Southend. Photo: Joe Dent/theposh.com.
“All we can do is regroup and go again. We have 17 games to go and we are not too far off the pace.
“I usually defend my players in press conferences, but we need to improve on that. As the manager I take responsibility for the side I picked and today it wasn't good enough. Six home defeats in the league is far too many.
“We have a week's training now and it's back to the drawing board. Omar did okay considering he was feeding off scraps. We played into him too early. He's only had one training session with us though. He will turn into a good player for us.”
Posh are next in League One action at Gillingham next Saturday (February 10).

EDMONTON—The United Conservative Party says one of its legislature members has resigned from caucus.
United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney issued a terse statement Friday that said Don MacIntyre resigned at about noon.
A tweet from MacIntyre says he's resigning to focus on family, but it does not specify whether he is stepping down as an MLA or just leaving caucus.
The United Conservative Party did not return phone calls requesting comment.
MacIntyre was elected to the legislature in the constituency of Innisfail-Sylvan Lake in 2015 under the Wildrose banner before the party merged with the United Conservatives.
Some Grammy winners who had to miss the ceremony in New York on Sunday might have felt that their opportunity to use the occasion to make a political statement had slipped by. Not Father John Misty — aka Josh Tillman — whose “Divine Comedy” album picked up a win for best recording package. He was touring overseas when the Grammys were held, but took advantage of a show in Sydney to belatedly deliver the speech he would have, if his booking agent had only anticipated the triumph.
Unlike some socially-conscious Grammy winners, Misty did not have “Time's Up” or DACA on his mind, but the alternative folk-rocker clearly does have some pressing concerns about the earth itself.
“Uh, well, thanks. I don't have a whole lot of time,” Misty told the Sydney crowd, at one point miming holding a Grammy, in a mock speech captured by a YouTuber. “But, God, f—, I just want to say f— society. I want to say that this government is a criminal organization.” He stammered for his next thought. “FlatEarth.com, please go check that out! And, you know, when I was growing up everyone told me — whether it's like mommy, daddy, the church, schoolteachers, whoever — everybody was always saying that it's what's on the inside that matters, you know, and I think that this is really evidence of the fact that it's what's outside that matters.”
In case anyone doubts that the “Divine Comedy” creator was actually doing some comedy, the website Flatearth.com does not seem to exist at the moment. (But if Misty were serious, he wouldn't be alone; the rapper B.o.B has repeatedly tweeted about his belief that the world is flat and even started a GoFundMe to raise money for anti-spherical research, seemingly with a straight face.)
Humor about the name and nature of the category would appear to be endemic to most of the nominees. Jonathan Coulton was also up for that award for “Solid State,” an album he released on Aimee Mann's label, Superego. They shared the stage at a gig in Cleveland this week and bantered about their wins and losses (Mann won for best folk album).
“Did you tell the people that you were nominated for a Grammy for your package?” Mann asked her labelmate, according to Cleveland.com. “His package was fantastic. I don't know if you've seen it. I was heavily involved with it.”
“Well, you had a lot of advice about my package when we were working on it,” Coulton answered. “I'm very happy with my package. It's an honor just to be nominated. As it turns out…”
“People liked Father John Misty's package a little better than yours,” Mann interrupted.
“Father John Misty has a better package than I do,” Coulton acceded. “I knew that going in.”
The award for recording package was actually a tie, with Misty's design getting exactly the same number of votes as an album by Magin Diaz, a 95-year-old Columbian musician who does not appear to have weighed in so far on the world or his package.
Every NHL award season, people talk more about the players who didn't get nominated than those who were. This year, there should be a lot of talk about one Calder Trophy snub, the Winnipeg Jets' Kyle Connor.
Let's start by saying that Mathew Barzal, Clayton Keller, and Brock Boeser had incredible seasons with their respective teams. It's also a near-guarantee that Barzal will be winning, regardless of who the finalists are.
However, the fact that Connor was not named a finalist for the Calder is strange, considering how incredible his first official season was.
A Spectacular Rookie Season
While you can argue about who should or shouldn't be finalists, you cannot argue that Connor had anything but a spectacular season.
Connor was given his first chance with the Jets during the 2016-17 season. It didn't go well for him. He bounced around the lineup, potting five points in 20 games before being sent back down to the Manitoba Moose, the Jets' AHL affiliate.
The Jets' first-round pick in 2015 started his rookie season in the minors but earned a quick call-up after Mathieu Perreault went down with an injury.
Thirty-one goals later, Connor finished the season on the Jets' top line and helped lead his team to a franchise-best record and now a first-round win over the Minnesota Wild.
Those 31 goals rank first in the NHL for rookies, while his 57 points put him fourth, ahead of Calder finalist Boeser.
A Serious Case
Only one rookie this year really pushed his name right to the top, while rookies not named Barzal fought for the right to be nominated.
And while the others certainly deserve the nomination, it's unfortunate that Connor didn't get any love, now or throughout the season.
Barzal, Keller, and Boeser all played on the first or second line throughout their year, but all three of those teams missed the playoffs. Connor played on the top line on an elite team that not only made the postseason but finished second in the league.
Connor rose above other excellent players such as Patrik Laine, Nikolaj Ehlers, Bryan Little, and Mathieu Perreault to cement himself into the line with Mark Scheifele and Blake Wheeler. He thrived there, putting up 22 points in his final 25 games.

Generated 4/23/2018. Provided by Hockey-Reference.com Generated 4/23/2018. Connor's signature during the 2017-18 season was his ability to come through in the clutch. His seven game-winning goals led all rookies and leave him tied for 11th in the league with names like Evgeni Malkin, Connor McDavid, and Alex Ovechkin. And in those final 25 games, he's tied for first with five.
Connor's clutch play helped the Jets finish 19-5-1 and head into the postseason on a nine-game home winning streak (which they have since extended to 12 games).
Unlike a number of top scorers, Connor did a lot of his best work at even strength, scoring 24 of his 31 without any advantage. That ties him with fellow Jet Laine, who scored 44 goals in total.
Where is the Love for Connor?
Sadly, Connor plays in Winnipeg, where national media attention is rarely received. He's also been overshadowed by big names like Wheeler and Laine, and big humans like Dustin Byfuglien. Along with a record-setting year for goaltender Connor Hellebuyck, the rookie didn't have much of a chance.
And that might be OK. Jared Clinton of The Hockey News reminded Jets fans that “there are bigger fish to fry with the way the Jets are playing as they head towards the post-season.”
Still, being the 12th rookie since the 2005-06 season to score 30 goals should have given him a significant amount of attention. Instead, Connor will focus on the very thing that he already has been all season: a Stanley Cup victory.
The three rookies nominated for the Calder Trophy had great rookie seasons, but the NHL overlooked the incredible season that Connor had. He can make it up, though, by helping his team to a Stanley Cup.

Surrey, B.C. resident Ravinderpaul Singh Mangat, also known as Rob Mangat, was arrested following an investigation by the B.C. Securities Commission's (BCSC) criminal investigations branch.
Mangat, who was arrested in Vancouver on August 5, is facing fraud charges under the Criminal Code.
The charges allege that Mangat persuaded a Vancouver resident to invest $500,000 in a scheme that he called "Privileged Investment Group." But instead of the high guaranteed returns that Mangat promised the investor, the money was used for Mangat's own personal expenses, including the repayment of his debts. The alleged fraud took place between 2012 and 2014.
Mangat has been charged with two counts of fraud over $5,000 and has been released on bail of $10,000, which includes several conditions. No trial date has been set.

Skeena-Bulkley Valley MP Nathan Cullen questions Prime Minister Justin Trudeau decision to purchase the Kinder Morgan pipeline in the House of Commons on May 30. (CPAC photo)
The Trans Mountain pipeline may be located in the Lower Mainland, but local Skeena-Bulkley Valley MP Nathan Cullen had some choice words for the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today over the decision to purchase the project.
“Liberals do know it's not legal to smoke weed until August, right? Because this makes no sense at all,” Cullen said to Trudeau in a heated debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday, May 30.
“Only Liberals would dump $4.5 billion on a 65-year-old pipeline and call that an energy strategy. Only Liberals would try to force through a pipeline and tankers through traditional First Nations territory and call that reconciliation,” Cullen said, adding, “Watch, he's about to say the environment and economy go together.”
#QP 8/ @nathancullen PM will say that enviro & economy must go together. You know what else must go together? Making promise to Cdns & then actually keeping it.@CanadianPM NDP celebrated Rachel Notley's approach…plan included getting oil resources to new markets pic.twitter.com/5uRwQJSvHp — CPAC (@CPAC_TV) May 30, 2018
Cheers of support for Cullen, a member of the NDP, erupted from the House of Commons. In response, Trudeau reminded MPs that the NDP had “celebrated” Alberta Premier Rachel Notley's plan to both protect the environment and grow the economy.
“Part of that plan included three elements: one, an absolute cap on oil sands emissions; two, a price on carbon that would apply to the Alberta economy; and three, getting our oil resources to new markets,” Trudeau said, emphasizing that Notley is also a New Democrat.
Cullen questioned the uncertainty of the project.
If it was such a great risk for a private company to take on, why would it be fair for the Canadian public to pick up the risk, he asked Trudeau.
The prime minister responded by quoting Notley, who said the government met the deadline set by Kinder Morgan and “this project has more certainly than ever.”
“We have demonstrated that despite the actions of one province trying to block this pipeline, the project is in the national interest and the jobs that will be assured and defended in this project are an integral part of our plan to fight climate change and grow the economy for future generations,” Trudeau said.
#QP 9/ @nathancullen If it's too risky for an oil pipeline co. to build an oil pipeline, why is it OK for Cdn public to assume all that risk…@CanadianPM …Despite one province trying to block pipeline, project is integral part of plan to fight climate change & grow economy pic.twitter.com/B8LfsMPLqX — CPAC (@CPAC_TV) May 30, 2018
Opponents to the Kinder Morgan project cite a 700 per cent increase in oil tanker traffic along the B.C. coast as one of the major red flags.
Cullen has been a fierce advocate for the oil tanker ban for Haida Gwaii and the North Coast, and tabled a private member's bill for such a ban in 2014. While he was pleased to see Bill C-48, the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act, pass the House of Commons in early May, he said it took too long, and now they have to wait for the Senate to pass the bill.
QUETTA: Balochistan's budget for fiscal year 2017-18 is scheduled to be presented today (Thursday) with an estimated total outlay of Rs320 billion. The Balochistan four parties coalition government's last budget is estimated to show a deficit of over Rs40 billion.
The volume of overall development budget is anticipated at Rs80 billion, however, the largest part of 2017-18 budget (Rs240 billion) will be allocated for non-development financial plan.
As per sources of Finance Department, Chief Minister's Adviser for Finance Sardar Aslam Bizenjo will unveil the budget in Balochistan Assembly session. The budget session has been convened on 4 pm at the Balochistan Assembly building.
The sources said it has been suggested that Rs38 billion should for earmarked for law and order situation, Rs 40 billion for education, Rs37 billion for health and Rs76 billion for Chief Minister's Divisional Development Programme.
The sources said that 6000 new vacancies are likely to be advertised in the new fiscal year's budget.
Proposals to increase 10 per cent salaries and pensions of the government employees have been added. The government has also suggested to grant 5000 minimum remuneration for labourers. Potable water and construction of roads projects are expected to be prioritised in 2017-18 fiscal year budget.
It is pertinent to mention that Rs240 billion are said to be allocated for non-development expenditure, mostly salaries, despite the National Database and Registration Authority's recent revelation that 28,367 government employees have invalid documents.
Meanwhile, Adviser to CM on Finance Sardar Aslam Bizenjo, in a meeting with a delegation comprising all district chairmen of the province, said that funds in bulk had been allocated for the local governments in the budget aiming at solving people's problems at grass root level. The Balochistan district chairmen of local government institutes staged a sit-in in front of Chief Minister's House last day and demanded powers and substantial funds for the institutes.
Bizenjo assured the delegation that the coalition government believed in strong institutes of the local government and well-aware of the challenges they were encountering.

Piers Morgan was praised by viewers today as he savagely lashed out at the Home Office and branded them "cowards" today.
The 53 year old presenter was left seething after Anthony Bryan, who is part of the Windrush generation, appeared on the show revealed that he hadn't been able to see his dying mum for two years because he couldn't get a British passport.
Piers was left particularly infuriated when Anthony revealed that he hadn't heard anything from the Home Office about receiving his passport.
Some Commonwealth citizens who arrived in the UK during the post war period have had problems accessing health care and benefits because they don't have the documentation to prove when they arrived in the UK.
Those who came to the UK before 1973 were granted automatic citizenship.

But because many have never applied for a passport and their landing cards have been destroyed they have struggled to prove their status.
Appearing on Good Morning Britain today alongside his son, Anthony said that it "means everything" to be British.
He added: "Right now I am stateless. I thought Britain was my country and to be told it's not being very upsetting.
Host Susanna Reid then asked when he would be receiving his passport.
"I still don't know," he replied, shocking Piers and Susanna. "I've heard nothing from the Home Office."

"You've heard nothing from the Home Office?!" Piers exclaimed.
He then launched into a rant aimed at the government and said: "Look, if the Home Office are watching this, we've asked them on the programme every day for the last two weeks with this scandal - they don't want to know. Amber Rudd doesn't want to know, the ministers don't want to know.
"Nobody wants to come on and talk about this and defend what they've done. We know why - they're cowards. They don't want to have the confrontation. Well we're going to have the conversation."
Piers then pointed to Anthony before glaring at the screen. "Get this man his passport today - he's British! He's as British as I am, as British as Susanna is, as British as Charlotte is and as British as his son is, who has a passport.
"How can this possibly be right? How have none of you called Anthony Bryan? What is going on?"
And while Piers may generally be divisive with viewers, most praised him for his rant.
One tweeted: "Fair plays to Piers Morgan there for once - using his celeb profile for good over #Windrush scandal #GMB."
Another remarked: "Go on piers tell them how it is #GMB."
A third commented: "Not very often do I agree with #PeirsMorgan but well done with this interview. This situation makes my blood boil too. #WindrushScandal #GMB."
While one angry fan commented: "#gmb @theresa_may @AmberRuddHR @BorisJohnson Are you watching? Get this man his passport so he can visit his 92 year old mother. Just cruel. #windrush disgusting how people have been treated. @piersmorgan help these people please!"

At the centre are Republican Roy Moore, a former jurist twice removed as state chief justice and now accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls decades ago, and Democrat Doug Jones, an erstwhile federal prosecutor best known for prosecuting two Ku Klux Klansmen responsible for killing four black girls in the 1963 bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church.
Many Republicans see the vote as chance to ratify their conservative values and protect President Donald Trump's agenda ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.
HUNTSVILLE, ALA.— Alabama Democrats see Tuesday's special Senate election as a chance to renounce a history littered with politicians whose race-baiting, bombast and other baggage have long soiled the state's reputation beyond its borders.
The winner will take the seat held previously by Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Republicans control the Senate with 52 seats.
And while Trump himself didn't campaign in the state after Moore was hit with allegations of sexual misconduct, the president recorded an audio message for robocalls that went to voters on Monday — underscoring the importance to Trump's agenda of keeping the seat in Republican hands.
The matchup mixes both Alabama's tortured history and the nation's current divisive, bitterly partisan politics, and it has made a spectacle of a Deep South state well acquainted with national scrutiny but not accustomed to competitive general elections.
“This is an election to tell the whole world what we stand for,” Jones told supporters at one stop Sunday, adding that his campaign “is on the right side of history.” At an earlier appearance, he declared Alabama is “at a crossroads” and that Moore, an unapologetic evangelical populist, tries only to “create conflict and division.”
Jones, 63, stops short of explicitly comparing Moore to the four-term Gov. George Wallace, whose populism was rooted in segregation. But Jones alluded Sunday to that era of Alabama politics.
“Elect a responsible man to a responsible office,” Jones said, repeating the campaign slogan of another Alabama governor, Albert Brewer, who nearly defeated Wallace in 1970 in a contest Alabama liberals and many moderates still lament as a lost opportunity.
Some of Jones' supporters put it even more bluntly. “I thought Alabama's image was pretty much at the bottom,” said Pat Lawrence, a retired software engineer in Huntsville. A Moore win, Lawrence added, “will be a whole new bottom.”
Those concerns extend even to some GOP quarters. Alabama's senior senator, Richard Shelby, confirmed Sunday that he did not vote for Moore, saying he wrote in another “distinguished” party figure he declined to name.
Yet for many Republicans, Moore is a paragon of traditional values. They reject accusations that he molested two teenage girls and pursued relationships with others decades ago. Moore denies the charges.
“Everyone has to vote their convictions,” said Kevin Mims of Montgomery, as he held his Bible outside his Baptist church Sunday in Montgomery. “My conviction is he's the right man for the job.”
Where Moore's critics see a state judge who defied federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Mims sees a stalwart who stands “on the word of God.” Other conservatives see an anti-establishment firebrand in the mould of Trump, who won Alabama by 28 percentage points.
Moore encourages that view with fundraising emails that urge backers to help him “defeat the elite,” a swipe at both Democrats and the establishment Republicans who tried to deny him the GOP nomination earlier this year.
Ultimately, Republicans from Moore to Trump himself are betting on a simple bottom line: Most Alabama conservatives simply won't defect to a Democrat.
“If Alabama elects liberal Democrat Doug Jones, all of our progress will be stopped cold,” Trump says in a robocall the Moore campaign plans to push out Monday.
The president also invokes a common fear among Republicans, calling Jones “a puppet of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,” the Democratic House and Senate leaders in Washington, both of them reviled by conservative voters. “Roy Moore is the guy we need to pass our Make American Great Again agenda,” the president insists.
Moore's baggage could make it difficult to draw conclusions about what the results might mean beyond Alabama, but both parties are watching closely.
Democrats need to flip 24 GOP-held seats to reclaim a House majority, and they're trying to dent the slim Republican advantage in the Senate and its dominance of statehouses around the country. In many of those races, they'll need the same thing Jones must get to win in Alabama: strong turnout among young and non-white voters, along with improved performance among suburban moderates.
A Jones victory would be hailed as a potential precursor, and Democrats have indicated they have a post-Alabama strategy even if Jones loses: They'll take Alabama's brand national, hammering Republicans as “the party of Donald Trump and Roy Moore.”

Islamabad
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Sunday strongly condemned the terror attack at Istanbul, Turkey on New Year's eve, and called for joint anti-terror fight.
Officials in Turkey said a lone gunman sprayed bullets at the people celebrating new year at Istanbul's famous Reina nightclub late Saturday after killing a police officer. They said at least 39 people are confirmed dead, including both Turkish and foreign nationals. Scores were injured, with several in critical condition.
“Pakistani people share the grief of Turkish people and stand by them, in this most painful time,” Nawaz Sharif said in a statement.
“Terrorism is our common enemy and the world needs to put up a joint fight against this menace,” the Pakistani Prime Minister said.
He said that Pakistan itself has suffered great losses of lives and property by terrorism and would continue to ensure all measures for its eradication.
The Foreign Ministry in a separate statement said Pakistan is “deeply anguished as terror and tragedy” have struck brotherly Turkey again.
“Pakistan condemns in the strongest possible terms the heinous terrorist attack that took place at a night club in Ortakoy area of Besiktas district in Istanbul,” the statement said.
“We reaffirm our strong and unwavering solidarity with the Government and people of Turkey in its resolute fight against terrorism and reiterate our belief that such heinous acts aimed at undermining Turkey's peace, stability, progress and internal harmony would never succeed,” it further said.
The statement said the Government and the people of Pakistan express their heartfelt grief and sorrow at this despicable act of terrorism against defenseless people gathered for New Year and extend their profound sympathies and condolences to the bereaved families and to the leadership.—NNI
Republicans in the Iowa House have voted to take the first step toward giving Iowans the opportunity to add a gun rights amendment to the state's constitution.
The same proposal would have to clear the legislature in 2019 or 2020 before Iowa voters could decide whether to add the gun rights language to the state's constitution. If adopted, it's requiring courts to strictly scrutinize any gun laws.
Representative Skyler Wheeler, a Republican from Orange City, dismissed what he called “lawyer talk” criticizing that part of the proposal.
“Whether you like it or not, we do have a fundamental individual right to keep and bear arms,” Wheeler said. “…And I like having a way to ensure that I keep that freedom against those who wish to strip that from me.”
Representative Liz Bennett, a Democrat from Cedar Rapids, called the proposal “extreme.”
“Making it harder to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them instead of working for gun safety,” Nelson said. “When we're talking about life and liberty, why aren't we talking about the life and liberty of kids who have died in the classroom?”
Representative Mary Wolfe, a Democrat from Clinton, said the proposal would open up a “Pandora's box” of litigation.
“And (it) would, in my opinion, result in the finding that a lot of our current gun safety laws are, in fact, unconstitutional,” Wolfe said.
Representative Matt Windschitl, a Republican from Missouri Valley, said the proposal will put a halt to “government over-reach” when it comes to gun regulations.
“If you just want to think I'm some crazy, gun-loving kook, fine. Have at that, but think about this: Voting ‘no' on this here tonight is denying Iowans an opportunity to have their voice heard in what they want to have in their state constitution,” Windschitl said.
After three hours of debate, the House passed the proposal on a 54-42 vote. All 54 “yes” votes came from Republicans. Two Republicans — Representatives Dave Heaton of Mount Vernon and Andy McKean of Anamosa — joined all the Democrats in the House in voting no.
ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (APP):SAARC President Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) Suraj Vaidya Monday underscored that Pakistan's support for enhancement of trade, investment and business amongst the member countries of the SAARC region.
Talking to media persons here today prior to his departure for Nepal on the last leg of week-long visit to Pakistan, he also appreciated the positive approach that Pakistan has been following to strengthen regional cooperation under the SAARC process.
He said that it was firm commitment of SAARC Chamber to continue all out efforts for further strengthening the role of SAARC in the region, says a press release issued here.
He said accompanied by VP SAARC Pak chapter Iftikhar Ali Malik, he held fruitful and result-oriented meeting with Federal Minister for Commerce and Textile Muhammad Pervaiz Malik, who assured of enhancing regional trade, Pakistan is playing proactive role in activating two most important regional organizations South Asian Association (SAARC) and Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO).
He further said the minster told him that Pakistan is in process of consulting its stakeholders for preparing a separate shorter sensitive list for the least developed countries of SAARC.
He said that another meeting with Sartaj Aziz, Deputy Chairman Planning Commission of Pakistan who was also kind enough to share his life-long expertise in the field of planning of new development projects in the region. He said SAARC chamber will take full benefits of the experiences of Planning Commission to launch new industrial joint ventures and development-oriented projects.
Suraj said that South Asia is mired in several crisis and conflicts at the moment due to various unresolved political and geographical factors and all these issues would be resolved effectively through strong regional connectivity and business to business contacts.He said law and order situation has been improved in Pakistan which is attracting foreign investment helpful enhancing trade activities in Pakistan that will lead regional trade cooperation among the member countries of South Asia.
Appreciating the role of CPEC, he said South Asia could drive the benefits from China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it is an energy deficient region which can use Central Asia's huge gas and oil resources to help address its energy deficits.
Surej Vaidya further said the economic corridor will connect China to the world and will have a significant impact on the China, Pakistan and regional economies as its role in bringing prosperity to the region cannot be ignored. “Social economic development is critical to convert challenges into opportunities in South Asia,” adding that the South Asia needs to connect with CPEC to derive benefits of the project which is spanned largely yielding investment and economic opportunities for South Asian nations which have potential and interest to gain from CPEC.
VP SAARC Chamber Iftikhar Ali Malik who was also present on the occasion in replay to a question, emphasized the need for expediting the process of trade liberalization in South Asian region. He said that cooperation in member states will help in promotion of trade and improving quality of life of our people who accounted for 1/5th of the world's population. He emphasized that intra regional trade is far below its potential.
Pakistan is looking at widening the ambit “so that we make these opportunities in our region a reality and improve the level of prosperity and economic development in this region”, he said.
There are other areas too that the SAARC countries should work on, such as formulating standards and working with different departments and states to improve ecosystem to boost services trade.
Malik urged the governments of SAARC member countries to adopt policies helpful to push export sector in regional trade agreements, while looking at issues of competitiveness across sectors in the form of reforms and liberalisation and focusing on the trade policy.

Indianapolis — Here's a quick look at who is trending up and who is trending down after the Detroit Lions' 24-10 preseason win over the Indianapolis Colts.
STOCK UP: A'Shawn Robinson
The second-year defensive tackle was a menace during his first-half playing time, batting down two throws and bullying a Colts lineman into the backfield on a third down, forcing the quarterback to pull the ball down and scramble, resulting in a sack.
Robinson showed a knack for knocking the ball down at the line of scrimmage last season, getting his hands on seven. If he can continue this trend and combine it with more consistent backfield penetration, he could be dominant.
STOCK DOWN: Michael Roberts
Roberts' inexplicable issues with ball security spilled into the preseason opener as the rookie tight end dropped a short pass and had the ball knocked free twice after catches, although neither was ruled a fumble. The one stripped from his grip in the middle of the field was overturned when it was ruled his forward momentum had been stopped. Later, a helmet popped the ball free just as he stepped out of bounds.
Those don't show up on the stat sheet, but it's playing with fire.
TREADING WATER: Jamal Agnew
Agnew's clearest path to contributing as a rookie will be in the return game, but the Colts kickers didn't do him any favors on Sunday. The early punts and kickoffs were either short or high enough they required a fair catch. Agnew lost his most returnable punt in the sun, letting it bounce once before picking it up and bringing it back seven yards.
STOCK UP: Kenny Golladay
Golladay had generated plenty of hype coming into the contest and made good on expectations, carrying his practice performance to his first game action. He finished with three catches, all against tight coverage, for 53 yards and two touchdowns. Obviously, the sample size remains small, but it continues to look like general manager Bob Quinn struck gold with the third-round pick.
STOCK DOWN: Matt Asiata
The veteran running back did little with his limited touches, showing minimal explosion or elusiveness as he gained six yards on five carries. He also showed poor field awareness, stepping out of bounds to negate a catch that would have given the Lions first-and-goal at the 2-yard line.
TREADING WATER: Zach Zenner
Zenner started off his day with a bang, taking advantage of a well-blocked edge and getting around the corner for a 19-yard gain. But after that, he mustered only seven yards on five carries and three yards on his lone reception. He also found himself out of place on a blitz, leading to quarterback Jake Rudock getting dropped for a sack on a third-down play.
STOCK UP: Anthony Zettel
Working with the first-team defense, Zettel's improved practice performance carried over to the preseason opener. He blasted by the Colts right tackle and combined with linebacker Tahir Whitehead on a tackle for loss and also had a couple quarterback pressures. With Kerry Hyder going down with an injury, the Lions need Zettel's emergence to be real.
STOCK DOWN: Jared Abbrederis
In the thick of a battle for a roster spot, the veteran didn't help his case against the Colts, dropping one, arguably two passes. He did catch two others, including a 17-yard gain, but his competition for a job — TJ Jones, Jace Billingsley and Keshawn Martin — all looked better with their opportunities.
STOCK UP: Alex Barrett and Jeremiah Valoaga
Zettel can't be the only defensive end that steps up with the growing list of injuries at the position. The two undrafted rookies made strong first impressions, combining for 12 tackles and each recording a sack.

Youth passionate to achieve peace: Telenor survey
ISLAMABAD/OSLO (PR): Organizations around the world are celebrating young people's contributions to conflict prevention and transformation, as well as inclusion, social justice and sustainable peace. Telenor Group recently reached out to Asian youth on these topics, and the majority say that they view artificial intelligence and access to education as crucial for building peace and improving their communities.
“In this month of Independence for Pakistan, our own freedom and building peace are top-of mind among our youth,” said IrfanWahab, CEO Telenor Pakistan. “And they see enormous potential in technology serving these very purposes.”
The findings were gleaned from two surveys of Asian youth, assessing their attitudes toward peace-building, harnessing technology for social good and securing the jobs of the tomorrow. Together, Telenor Group surveyed nearly 7,000 millennials, ages 15-30, in seven markets in Asia. The two Telenor online surveys were conducted in May of 2017 and September-October 2016.
Artificial intelligence: Best peace-building technology
When asked which technology has the largest potential to give rise to peace, 32 percent of the respondents placed their bets on artificial intelligence, followed by the Internet of Things (30 percent), and virtual reality (28 percent). Across all markets, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and virtual reality rank consistently in the top three – suggesting the vast potential seen in these future technologies by the millennial generation.
Youth to leaders: More education, more inclusion
Among social causes that can lead to peace, including environmental protection, unemployment mitigation, education inclusion and civil rights, Asian youth responded that they are most passionate about education. Thirty-seven percent of survey takers ranked this as their top cause. Forty-seven percent of them say that leaders should invest more in developing inclusive education systems that give equal access and opportunities to all. Youth respondents' second-ranked cause was climate change and global warming (21 percent). Other global issues prioritized by Asia's millennials include mental health (17 percent), youth unemployment (17 percent), and gender inequality (8 percent).
Innovative, entrepreneurial spirits
One thing that united all markets surveyed was the youths' own perspectives of their place in the world. Uniformly in all surveyed markets, nearly 40 percent of the youth described themselves as ‘the most innovative and entrepreneurial generation in history'.
Assessing tomorrow's jobs
In a second Telenor survey, youth in Pakistan , Singapore, Malaysia, India, Myanmar and Bangladesh were polled on their attitudes about their future career, technology's impact and the skills they need to be best prepared for the jobs of tomorrow. The results indicate that while Asia's young adults embrace the importance of technology, non-technical human skills still play an important role.
37% of Pakistani youth believes that the most important skills to obtaining a great job in the future will be the ‘ability to inspire others, and leadership capability'
“Today's youth have opportunities unlike any generation before. They were born into a connected world, and we want to know more about the roles that they believe technology can play, both in their own lives and in bettering the world around them. At Telenor, we believe that connectivity and digital services play a fundamental role in improving lives, and it's inspiring to learn that Asia's youth are with us in this mission,” said Ola Jo Tandre, Head of Social Responsibility, Telenor Group.
“This is exactly why we work with them every year through our Telenor Youth Forum, where we have them innovating new solutions to some of the many challenges facing their generation,” he added.
Telenor Youth Forum in final stages of recruitment for 2017 program
Initiatives such as the Telenor Youth Forum provide a global stage for youth to brainstorm and create innovative concepts that can drive real change in the world.
Designed as a year-long program in partnership with the Nobel Peace Centre, the Telenor Youth Forum challenges its delegates with solving major socioeconomic crises facing youth. They are put in teams and paired with mentors from organizations such as UNICEF, Interbridge, the Red Cross, Techfugees and Telenor Research. Delegates learn skills such as service/product design and prototyping, in addition to insights on issues that can only be gained through hands-on experience.

The government is failing in providing clean drinking water. We live in a country where people die due to unhygienic water, 44% of the population doesn't have access to clean drinking water and the percentage is proliferating quickly. Circumstances are way worse in rural areas as 90% don't have access to the basic necessity of life and the threat of clean drinking water scarcity contains one of the prime challenges Pakistan is facing. Shocking research has shown that about 200,000 children in Pakistan die every year due to diarrhea alone.
Agencies and societies need to work together and take all possible steps to resolve the water shortage and provision of clean drinking water to citizens.

Neil Young and Crazy Horse
Neil Young is reuniting with Crazy Horse to play a pair of unrehearsed shows in Fresno, California next month. “First time in a long time, live on stage. No rehearsal,” Young wrote on his official website.
As Jambase notes, Neil Young and Crazy Horse last played live on July 7th, 2014 at Laugardalshöllin in Reykjavík, Iceland with a lineup consisting of Ralph Molina, Frank “Poncho” Sampedro, Dorene Carter, YaDonna West, and the late Rick Rosas standing in for Billy Talbot, who was recovering from a stroke.
It's unclear who will be accompanying Young this time around, but former member Nils Lofgren tweeted that he's “jumping back in” with the group. Back in 2016, Young told Rolling Stone that Crazy Horse “has a huge future” that included Talbot. The band's last studio album was 2012's Psychedelic Pill.
The shows take place at Warnors Theatre on May 1st and 2nd. Tickets are available here.
A new hormonal therapy designed to treat uterine fibroids called relugolix has finished a Phase 3 study in Japan, and the results are positive.
That's welcome news for a SoftBank-based company based in Basel, Switzerland called Roivant Sciences that's separately dealing with much lousier news.
But let's back up a bit first.
The Phase 3 trial was one of several Phase 3 trials of relugolix that are ongoing, including in the U.S. and Europe, where the drug is also being tested as a means to treat endometriosis-associated pain and to help men with advanced prostate cancer by suppressing their testosterone levels. The result out of Japan isn't enough to win it FDA approval, but Myovant, the biopharmaceutical company behind it, is expected to use the result from Japan to support its approval here in the U.S.
Why does it matter? Well, for one thing, a win would be meaningful for Myovant, which staged the biggest biotech IPO of last year, shortly after recruiting Lynn Seely as its CEO. (Seely was formerly the chief medical officer of Medivation, which sold to Pfizer last year for $14 billion). In other words, expectations are high.
Myovant is also a subsidiary of Roivant, a young holding company whose 32-year-old founder, Vivek Ramaswamy, believes will become a giant holding company for dozens of independent biopharmaceutical companies.
Ramaswamy sold SoftBank on that vision over the summer, in fact, with SoftBank leading a $1.1 billion investment in the company (and getting a steep discount on its privately held shares in the process, we're told).
Then, disaster. More specifically, early last week, Axovant — another of Roivant's holding companies that was taken public and wound up becoming the biggest biotech IPO of 2015 — received news that its much-hyped, experimental Alzheimer's drug, interperdine, doesn't work. (We wrote about that here.) It was a huge blow to the company, whose shares plummeted 75 percent that day and have remained flat. It was also a black mark for Roivant, which has told a convincing story until now about using data more effectively than big pharma companies that have exponentially more employees and resources.
Now, to regain his place as a wunderkind of the biotech world, Ramaswamy — a Harvard-educated biology major with a law degree from Yale — needs some positive momentum.
Relugolix is a smaller bet for Roivant, but it's not insignificant. According to one study, 70 percent of white women, and between 80 and 90 percent of black women, will develop fibroids by age 50, and 90 percent of women who are diagnosed with them seek medical or surgical treatment of their fibroids within a year. (Many others don't realize they have them.)
The less invasive route is, of course, medicine. In fact, reloguolix is hoping to grab market share of a hormone therapy already in the market: Leuprorelin, a product that first received FDA approval in 1985 and is currently used in the treatment of hormone-responsive cancers like prostate cancer and breast cancer, as well as to treat estrogen-dependent conditions, including uterine fibroids and endometriosis. (It's marketed under different brands by different companies. The German multinational conglomerate Bayer sells it as Viadur; The U.S. company Abbott Laboratories markets it as Lupor.)
There is still work to do; the other Phase 3 studies for relugolix were kicked off fairly recently, meaning it could be until closer to 2019 before the drug receives approval — if it's able to win approval at all. In the meantime, another biopharma giant, AbbVie, is developing a competing drug called elagolix, so the race is on.
In the meantime, Ramaswamy, who worked formerly as hedge fund analyst, is hedging his bets. Axovant, for example, is seeking to find other uses for inteperdine, part of which involves an ongoing Phase 2 test to treat a progressive brain disorder called Lewy body dementia. (The market is much smaller than for Alzheimer's patients. The disease impacts 1.3 million Americans, for example, compared with Alzheimer's, which impacts 5.5 million.)
Another Roivant subsidiary, Enzyvant, is also seeking FDA approval to treat a rare pediatric disease called DiGeorge Syndrome and last month received a designation from the FDA that should move it through the review process more quickly. (The path is more streamlined in the case of rare diseases with life or death consequences.)
Roivant appears to be focusing more nakedly on getting third party biotech companies to partner with it on drug development, too. The idea, presumably, is that Roivant can bring them efficiencies by opening up its infrastructure to them.
Earlier this week, for example, Roivant plugged $116 million into a company in which it already owned a stake: Arbutus, a hepatitis B-focused biotech firm. It's was a sizable gamble on the company. Then again, it's chasing a big market. Approximately 350 million people in the world are believed to have the disease. Arbutus will now rely on Roivant for functions that it would otherwise have had to build in-house.
Whether Roivant's various moves will pay off enough will require more time to learn. In the meantime, Roivant — which has now raised more than $2 billion from investors, including from Founders Fund, and the hedge funds Viking Global Investors and QVT Financial — will have to hope its investors remain patient.
We reached out to Ramaswamy for this story; through a spokesman, he declined to comment.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea violated United Nations sanctions to earn nearly $200 million in 2017 from banned commodity exports, according to a confidential report by independent U.N. monitors, which also accused Pyongyang of supplying weapons to Syria and Myanmar.
The report to a U.N. Security Council sanctions committee, seen by Reuters on Friday, said North Korea had shipped coal to ports, including in Russia, China, South Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam, mainly using false paperwork that showed countries such as Russia and China as the coal origin, instead of North Korea.
The 15-member council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.
“The DPRK (North Korea) is already flouting the most recent resolutions by exploiting global oil supply chains, complicit foreign nationals, offshore company registries and the international banking system,” the U.N. monitors wrote in the 213-page report.
The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report. Russia and China have repeatedly said they are implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea.
SYRIA, MYANMAR
The monitors said they had investigated ongoing ballistic missile cooperation between Syria and Myanmar, including more than 40 previously unreported North Korea shipments between 2012 and 2017 to Syria's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which oversees the country's chemical weapons program.
The investigation has shown “further evidence of arms embargo and other violations, including through the transfer of items with utility in ballistic missile and chemical weapons programs,” the U.N. monitors wrote.
They also inspected cargo from two North Korea shipments intercepted by unidentified countries en route to Syria. Both contained acid-resistant tiles that could cover an area equal to a large scale industrial project, the monitors reported.
One country, which was not identified, told the monitors the seized shipments can “be used to build bricks for the interior wall of a chemical factory.”
Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013. However, diplomats and weapons inspectors suspect Syria may have secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability.
The Syrian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report.
The U.N. monitors also said one country, which they did not identify, reported it had evidence that Myanmar received ballistic missile systems from North Korea, along with conventional weapons, including multiple rocket launchers and surface-to-air missiles.
Myanmar U.N. Ambassador Hau Do Suan said the Myanmar government “has no ongoing arms relationship, whatsoever, with North Korea” and is abiding by the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
BANNED EXPORTS, IMPORTS
Under a 2016 resolution, the U.N. Security Council capped coal exports and required countries to report any imports of North Korean coal to the council sanctions committee. It then banned all exports of coal by North Korea on Aug. 5.
The U.N. monitors investigated 16 coal shipments between January and Aug. 5 to ports in Russia, China, Malaysia and Vietnam. They said Malaysia reported one shipment to the council committee and the remaining 15 shipments violated sanctions.
After the coal ban was imposed on Aug. 5, the U.N. monitors investigated 23 coal shipments to ports in Russia, China, South Korea and Vietnam. The U.N. monitors said all those shipments “would constitute a violation of the resolution, if confirmed.”
“The DPRK combined deceptive navigation patterns, signals manipulation, transshipments as well as fraudulent documentation to obscure the origin of the coal,” the monitors said.
The U.N. monitors “also investigated cases of ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products in violation (of U.N. sanctions) ... and found that the network behind these vessels is primarily based in Taiwan province of China.”
The monitors said one country, which they did not name, told them North Korea had carried out such transfers off its ports of Wonsan and Nampo and in international waters between the Yellow Sea and East China Sea between October and January.
The report said several multinational oil companies, which were not named, were also being investigated for roles in the supply chain of petroleum products transferred to North Korea.
Google's big data advantage might help Lens succeed where others have failed.
Google Lens was one of the major announcements of the Google I/O 2017 keynote, and an important part of Google's Pixel 2 phone plans. For Google, a company with a long history in visual search, Lens is the latest step in an ongoing journey around computer vision. This is an endeavor which can be traced back to Google Image Search years ago, and which is a close relative of the AI powering Google Photos' object and scene recognition.
For the moment, Google is only talking about a "preview" of lens shipping on Pixel 2 phones. But as a part of Google Assistant, Google Lens has the potential to reach every Android phone or tablet on Marshmallow and up, letting these devices recognize objects, landmarks and other details visually (with a little help from your location data) and conjure up actionable information about them. For example, you might be able to identify a certain flower visually, then bring up info on it from Google's knowledge graph. Or it could scan a restaurant in the real world, and bring up reviews and photos from Google Maps. Or it could identify a phone number o a flier, or an SSID and password on the back of a Wi-Fi router.
Whether it's through a camera interface in Google Assistant, or after the fact through Google Photos, the strength of Lens — if it works as advertised — will be the accurate identification and the ability to provide useful info based on that. It's absolutely natural, then, that Lens should come baked into the camera app (and Photos itself) on the new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones.
Big, BIG data
Like all the best Google solutions, Lens is a product of AI and data.
Like all the best Google solutions, Google Lens is rooted in big data. It's ideally suited to Google, with its vast reserves of visual information and growing cloud AI infrastructure. Doing this instantly on a smartphone is a step beyond running similar recognition patterns on an uploaded image via Google Image Search, but the principles are the same, and you can easily draw a straight line to Google Lens, starting with Image Search and going through the now-defunct Google Goggles.
Back in 2011, Google Goggles was impressive, futuristic and in the right setting, genuinely impressive. In addition to increased speed, Google Lens goes a step beyond this by not only identifying what it's looking at, but understanding it and connecting it to other things that Google knows about. It's easy to see how this might be extended over time, tying visible objects in photos to the information in your Google account.
This same intelligence lies at the heart of Google Clips, the new AI-equipped camera that knows when to take a photo based on composition, and what it's looking at — not unlike a human photographer. That all starts with understanding what you're looking at.
The potential for Google Lens is only going to grow as Google's capabilities in AI and big data increase.
At a more advanced level, Google's VPS (visual positioning system) builds on the foundations of Google Lens on Tango devices to pinpoint specific objects in the device's field of vision, like items on a store shelf. As mainstream phone cameras improve, and ARCore becomes more widely adopted, there's every chance VPS could eventually become a standard Lens feature, assuming your device hit a certain baseline for camera hardware.
What can Google Lens do on the Pixel 2?
Google is calling the version of Lens on Pixel 2 phones a "preview" for the time being, and it's obvious the company has ambitions for Lens far beyond its current implementation on these handsets. At the October 4, 2017 presentation, Google demonstrated identifying albums, movies and books based on their cover art, and pulling email addresses from a flyer advertisement.
Those are relatively simple tasks, but again, Google surely wants to start small, and avoid the pitfalls experienced by Samsung's Bixby service in its early days.

How is Google Lens different to Bixby Vision?
On the surface the two products might appear very similar — at least to begin with.
However, the potential for Google Lens is only going to grow as Google's capabilities in AI and computer vision become stronger. And the contrast with one of Samsung's most publicized features is pretty stark. The Korean firm is still a relative newcomer in AI, and that's reflected in the current weakness of Bixby Vision on the Galaxy S8 and Note 8.
Right now Bixby can help you identify wine (badly), as well as flowers (sometimes) and animals (to varying degrees of success) — as well as products, through Vivino, Pinterest and Amazon respectively. Samsung doesn't have its own mountain of data to fall back on, and so it has to rely on specific partnerships for various types of objects. (The service routinely tells you it's "still learning," as a caveat when you first set it up.)
What's more, while Samsung can (and apparently does plan to) bring Bixby to older phones via software updates, Google could conceivably flip the switch through Assistant and open the floodgates to everything running Android 6.0 and up. Both services are going to require some more work before that happens, though.
Nevertheless, anyone who's used Bixby Vision on a Galaxy phone can attest that it just doesn't work very well, and Google Lens seems like a much more elegant implementation. We don't yet know how well Lens will work in the real world, but if it's anywhere near as competent as Google Photos' image identification skills, it'll be something worth looking forward to.
We'll have more to say on Google Lens when we test it in more detail on the Pixel 2 phones.
KARACHI - At least five people, including two female school teachers, lost their lives while over two dozen others were wounded when an speeding passenger bus collided with the column of the National Highway Toll Plaza in the suburbs of Karachi on Tuesday.
“The accident occurred when the bus was on its way to Badin from Karachi,” said Steel Town SHO Ghulam Mujtaba.
He added that driver of the bus lost control just few yards away from the Toll Plaza and resultantly the bus ran into one of the columns of the Toll Plaza.”
Mujtaba further said that there was also a loaded oil tanker beside the column, but fortunately the bus narrowly missed it. “Otherwise the number of casualties would have been higher,” he feared.
Driver of the bus, who has been identified as Achar, however managed to escape following the accident while the bus's conductor Shabbir was also wounded in the accident and admitted to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. Police said that Shabbir had no idea what exactly had happened as he was busy in handing tickets to the passengers at the time of incident.
Following the accident, rescuers from the different welfare organisations, including Edhi Foundation and Chhipa Welfare as well as police and Rangers also reached the site and participated in the rescue operation. Heavy machinery was also brought in to the site of accident in order to cut off the bus and transport the victims to hospitals.
The initial police investigation suggests that the accident occurred due to breaks failure. However, further investigation is underway.
“Apparently, the accident took place due to breaks failure,” said District Malir SSP Rao Anwar. “We have also approached the motor vehicle department to examine the bus which would help the investigators to ascertain the actual cause of the accident,” he added.
Case has been registered while police is looking for the bus driver.
60 huts gutted in fire at Gulshan-e-Iqbal
As many as 60 huts were reduced to rubble when a fire broke out at a shanty town in Gulshan-e-Iqbal neighbourhood on Tuesday afternoon. At least three occupants also sustained burn injuries in the incident.
Slums in Block 13 of Gulshan-e-Iqbal suddenly caught intense fire which engulfed the whole area. According to the witnesses, people ran for the cover.
According to fire brigade spokesperson, four vehicles immediately rushed to the site and after operating for an hour, the firefighters managed to extinguish it. Fire caused huge financial damage to the inhabitants of the slums. firefighters said that the cause behind the incident was yet to be ascertained. However, it seems that the fire broke out due to short-circuiting.

BENICIA >> The Benicia State Parks Association wants to transport you back in time. Well, at least ecologically and historically.
The State Recreation Area will be hosted to “A Walk Through Time,” on Saturday where senior environmental scientist Cyndy Shafer and “Vizzit” founder Arthur Bart-Williams will lead a hike along the San Francisco Bay Trail. Along the way they will discuss the age of the dinosaurs, the ice age, and modern human history, “including an engineering marvel that delivered electricity to the Bay Area,” a statement from the Parks Association said.
Vizzit is an app that leads smart phone tours of areas. Hikers will listen to narration by Doug McConnell as they take in the panoramic views of the bay.
The hike will be a little less than a mile and a half over some gentle slopes.
The walk starts at 10 a.m. at the Forest Deaner Native Plant Garden parking lot. The event is free but you must pay to park. The walk is due to end around 11:30 a.m.
Visitors with disabilities who need assistance should call Shafer at (707) 769-5652 prior to arriving.

The Vigil is to mark the 37th anniversary of Zimbabwe's independence by a demonstration outside the Embassy in London next Saturday in protest at Zanu PF's misrule.
Source: London protest at Zanu PF misrule – Zimbabwe Vigil Diary: 15th April 2017
At the same time, Zanu PF in the UK has invited people to join anniversary celebrations they are holding in the small town of Aylesbury some 50 miles from London. They seem to have plenty of money as they are offering ‘free entry, free food, free parking, free entertainment'. Noticeably, they describe themselves as ‘UK based Zimbabweans'; it is only hidden away in small print that the hosts are Zanu PF UK.
Zanu PF have become increasingly emboldened in the UK by the recognition they have been given by the British government, which has allowed blood-stained Zanu PF leaders from Zimbabwe to visit Britain while turning away opposition activists. The reason it gives is that activists don't have much money and might not return home. Zanu PF ministers, on the other hand, can travel with the resources of the state behind them.
The Vigil is hoping to be joined by South Africans in London, who last week held a big protest against President Zuma outside their Embassy, around the corner from the Vigil.
South Africans are increasingly finding themselves in the same position as Zimbabweans – victims of rapacious and corrupt political elites subverting democracy. We often get South Africans dropping by at the Vigil and look forward to working together with them to deal with our common problems.
It gives us no satisfaction to point out that the Vigil has spent years warning South Africa that if they did not help resolve the Zimbabwean crisis, the problem would increasingly affect them too. If they wish to see their future they need only look to Zimbabwe.
Other points
Our sister organisation Restoration of Human Rights in Zimbabwe (ROHR) wants to make it clear that it is not involved with a UK group calling itself Zimbabwe Human Rights Organisation which has hijacked the ROHR name and says it is to demonstrate outside the Zimbabwe Embassy on 18 th April. The real ROHR will be joining the Vigil on Saturday.
ROHR in Zimbabwe is taking a leading role in a new initiative, a ‘peace bandwagon', to prevent violence and make space for democracy – the Zimbabwe Peace Actors' Platform (ZimPAP). The initiative has moved on considerably since it was started in December last year. ZimPAP will be launched in Mashonaland East province on 17 th April with a peace soccer tournament and registration of volunteer civilian friends for peace. Here in the UK, ROHR has been actively fundraising for ZimPAP, notably ROHR Reading and ROHR Central London branches.
One of the comments we received about last week's diary was from a Muslim in Zimbabwe who shared our scepticism about plans for Muslim schools announced by Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Lazarus Dokora. The message said: ‘My friends among the small Muslim community here in Mbare must be bemused by Dokora's antics. The first time I joined them for the prayers at the opening of Ramadan, I arrived early and found myself in a waiting room with a few young men watching TV until they were ready for prayers. One of them worked for the Nigerian embassy and was collecting funds to help victims of Boko Haram. Another Muslim friend, untrained imam of a small community in Hurungwe / Tengwe, has been trying for years to raise funds to build a mosque. When he was invited to meet Saudi donors in Chinhoyi, he called on me as soon as he got back to say they'd offered him the money. I started congratulating him; he replied “but I refused it. I didn't like the abusive way they spoke about other believers.” Dokora's agenda is, of course, his attempt to prop up Mugabe and Mnangagwa. Fundamentalist Islam is even less hospitable to critical thinking than are the profit ministries. One of our local zany leaders claims to be the biggest local drug supplier; the more intelligent of his colleagues are developing a market for “Broncho for the spirit” which Marx called “opium of the people” and Lenin “a cheap kind of spiritual vodka”.'
We were interested to see a story on the Zimeye website about the plight of Zimbabweans in the diaspora trying to satisfy the demands made on them by people at home. Much of the story is nonsense but we can confirm from London that many exiled Zimbabweans are feeling this pressure. It has resulted in marriage breakups and even suicides as people try to show they have ‘made it' here and are asked to provide not only basic needs but even luxuries. The Vigil thinks that Zimbabweans are developing a culture of dependency which stops them trying to solve themselves the problems they are facing.

It's one of the Okanagan's most cherished and historic landmarks: the Myra Canyon Trestles.
Nestled in a canyon that overlooks Kelowna from the southeast, the trestles are celebrating 25 years since volunteers worked on restoring the old rail bridges to be used as a recreational site.
The Myra Canyon Trestle Restoration Society (MCTRS) has launched its new website to mark the anniversary.
History, trail information, and information on how to get involved with the society is available at myratrestles.com.
Completed in 1914, Chief Engineer Andrew McCullough built the line for the Canadian Pacific Railway to facilitate the movement of minerals and lumber from the south and southeast corner of B.C. to Hope.
The rails were removed from the line in 1980.
In 1993, volunteers with donations set out to make the abandoned trestles through the Myra Canyon safe, adding four-foot boardwalks and guard rails.
Myra Canyon's 18 trestles became a National Historic Site in 2003, just months before a wildfire destroyed 12 of the bridges and damaged two steel trestles.
Over the next four years, aided by Federal and Provincial Disaster Financial Assistance funding, the trestles were restored.
Cyclist and hikers are drawn to the unique site from around the world.
The Society estimates 70,000 people travel the Myra Canyon trestles every year.
It is part of Canada's Great Trail, formerly known as the Trans Canada Trail.
The Society is holding it's AGM April 11, where the last 25 years will be reviewed and celebrated.
Pakistan's ascension as a member of SCO is a reason to celebrate.
The regional alliance is made on order for us.
Pakistan's inclusion will boost the collective security of member countries and also help us eliminate the terrorist threat for good.
There's one big fly in the SCO soup though, admitted as member the same day as Pakistan.
Will the Shanghai spirit be able to pull it out of the soup? Will India be able to dry its wings in the multipolar sun and fly high with the rest of us?
More worrisome than India's thorny relations with fellow members Pakistan and China is the trajectory of the Modi government that is taking the ‘world's largest democracy' straight to the lap of Uncle Sam.
What about the US-India nexus in Afghanistan and their joint hybrid war against CPEC? What about LEMOA and other foundational agreements with the US that undermine the very purpose of SCO? Besides, can Eurasian connectivity be built upon the dead bodies of innocent men, women and children of Kashmir?
Some friends are hopeful that the SCO would have a sane influence on Modi's India.
They point at the astute leadership of the regional alliance and the sensible charter of the organization they lead.
President Putin and President Xi have emerged as visionary world leaders and, according to these optimistic friends, we can count on them to pull India back from the edge of the cliff and make it see the benefits of regional cooperation and their win-win plans.
Other friends insist that India won't see the light as long as Modi rules the roost.
I have no doubts about the superb leadership qualities of both President Putin and President Xi and the sincerity of their positive vision for the future of our world.
If India jumps aboard the SCO-ship whole-heartedly, it would facilitate the stabilization of the region and be a shot in the arm for inter-connectivity and Eurasian integration.
People of India stand to benefit tremendously from the multipolar motif of win-win cooperation.
The question is: Does Modi care about all that?
Being a die-hard optimist myself, I'd like to hope that inclusion in SCO would spur India to become a responsible member of the emergent multipolar bloc and get down from its high-horse of Hindutva hegemony.
I'd like to hope that India would stop auditioning for the role of a Mini-Me hegemon for Uncle Sam and embrace its neighbors as equal partners in the multipolar spirit.
But this hope is outweighed by apprehensions about Modi's India that are too big to ignore.
The Modi government not only refused to participate in the recent Belt & Road summit in Beijing, it is actively subverting projects launched under the initiative; not only in Pakistan to its west, but also in Bangladesh and Myanmar to its east, Nepal in its North and Sri Lanka in its South.
It preferred to team up with unipolar Japan to announce parallel infrastructure projects of its own.
It is aligned with the US and its puppet government in Afghanistan, the arch-spoilers of peace in the SCO neighborhood.
And unfortunately, the problem goes much deeper than these symptoms.
Clearly, Modi's decisions on these and several other counts that militate against the momentum of regional cooperation are not arbitrary or taken in isolation.
They reflect the geo-political orientation of the Modi government and its Hindutva underpinnings.
Let's not mistake it: Modi's India is driven by dreams of regional hegemony not win-win cooperation.
The chauvinistic Hindu nationalism unleashed by him would settle for nothing less.
Actually, the Modi government's vision for India and its place in the world is a perfect fit for the divisive and violent unipolar worldview.
Its Hindutva policies are fanning extremism and intolerance not only across the length and breadth of India but also in the neighborhood.
The brutality of repression in Kashmir under Modi is unprecedented, making the peaceful resolution of the dispute more difficult.
Egged on by the US, Modi's India would like to position itself as a counterweight to China rather than its partner.
It is inclined to please Uncle Sam for a place on the imperial table rather than join its neighbors to build collective security for the region.
According to the Hindutva ideology, South Asian countries are to be absorbed back into one big Mother India one day in any case, and until that happens, we are all expected to accept our place as vassals of India not its equal partners.
While the SCO aims to contain chaos and instability through regional cooperation on counter-terrorism and security, Modi's India is actively involved in spreading chaos and instability in the region in partnership with the global badmash.
While the multipolar plans of regional connectivity and trade depend on a peaceful neighborhood, the rabid notions of Hindu supremacy and hegemony harbored by the Modi regime can only make the region more volatile.
His corporate backers are obviously more interested in dollars than regional harmony.
So, it's not as simple as President Putin and President Xi convincing Modi to change some of his policies.
Of course, India could always decide to distance itself from the US and support Moscow's initiative on Afghanistan.
It could join the Belt & Road Initiative and build the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar corridor.
Under the SCO umbrella, it could work with Pakistan to bring peace to Kashmir.
But this calls for a fundamental reorientation, a new vision for India and its place in the world.
And that is too much to expect from the Modi government.
Even if the Modi-Trump meeting in Washington scheduled for later this month doesn't bring Modi the dividends he is hoping for, he would take his disappointments in his stride and continue to play the useful idiot to Uncle Sam.
He has sunk too deep into his hubris to change his tune.
Modi's India would erode cohesion within the SCO like it did in the case of BRICS.
Though I'm a die-hard optimist, I tend to agree with my friends who say that India won't see the light until Modi rules the roost.

One of the NFL's biggest sponsors is coming back.
Verizon will pay approximately $2.5 billion in a five-year deal with the NFL, sources told ESPN. That would be roughly twice the annual price of Verizon's previous deal with the league.
The new deal for the largest U.S. wireless carrier looks very different from its last deal. That's because Verizon has gone from being solely a mobile carrier to also being a video content company after its purchases of AOL in 2015 and Yahoo! in 2017 for $4.4 billion each.
The deal allows Verizon to stream live in-market NFL games on any one of its websites, with Yahoo! being the predominant home.
Unlike the last deal, which allowed Verizon to have the exclusive streaming rights for in-market live games only on mobile phones, the live in-market games will be available on the Verizon platforms on phones of all carriers starting this postseason. In 2018, it will include all tablets.
To monetize the deal, Verizon will have ad inventory within the games that it streams on mobile, which includes in-market games on Thursday, Sunday afternoon, Sunday night and Monday night. DirecTV has rights for all out-of-market games on Sunday.
"Media is one of the major pillars for us now," said Brian Angiolet, the company's global chief media and content officer. "And sports is going to be the most important part of that content."
For the NFL, the deal gives the league greater distribution as people shift their viewing habits, said Hans Schroeder, chief operating officer of NFL media and business.
"This model allows our product to be much more broadly available and give greater access to our fans," Schroeder said. "People are still going to gravitate towards watching games on the best screen possible, which is television, but for people who are on-the-go and younger fans, this deal makes sense."
While NFL ratings on television have declined for a second straight season, Angiolet said he had no concern doing this media deal because mobile is experiencing an uptick.
"The NFL generates the greatest audience in mobile in our experience," Angiolet said. "Not only has year-over-year mobile viewership been growing, but NFL mobile consumption has been growing, too."
Angiolet also said he wasn't concerned about the negative attention turned at the league, including the protests around the national anthem.
"We've been a partner of the league since 2010, and this is a five-year deal," Angiolet said. "The climate might shift temporarily, but in the long haul, the NFL is a great partner and we had no concern renewing our deal."
In addition to live streaming, Verizon will have broader highlight rights and plans to experiment with augmented reality and virtual reality. It also hopes to use the NFL deal to produce original content across Verizon's network of sites organized under a new content company called Oath.
Other rights holders, including ESPN, will continue to have their broadcasts available to stream on computer through a login with the fan's cable carrier.
ALMATY (Reuters) - Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva, daughter of former Uzbek leader Islam Karimov, has stepped down as Uzbekistan's UNESCO representative, becoming the latest official from her father's administration to depart.
Karimova-Tillyaeva, 39, said on her Facebook page she would work on her own projects in charity, education and other areas. She did not say whether she planned to return to Uzbekistan after quitting the Paris-based job.
Karimova-Tillyaeva's departure from public service follows a series of reshuffles made by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev who has removed from his cabinet a number of officials appointed under his predecessor, who died in 2016.
This week, Mirziyoyev consolidated his power by sacking veteran security boss Rustam Inoyatov, who had been regarded as the second most influential official in the country after the president himself.
Karimova-Tillyaeva first announced her plans to resign last August, roughly a year after the death of her father who had run the ex-Soviet Central Asian nation with an iron fist for 27 years.
She said at the time she wanted to focus on her family and personal goals.
Since her father's death Karimova-Tillyaeva had been his only close relative holding a prominent government post.

2018 Ford Mustang Enlarge Photo
It looks like Ford may be preparing a one-two punch on the Chevrolet Camaro. After it announced the 2018 Mustang GT would arrive with 460 horsepower from the 5.0-liter Coyote V-8 engine—not so coincidentally 5 hp greater than the output of the Camaro SS—now Ford might tackle the Camaro SS 1LE given mounting evidence pointing to a new performance package.
Various postings to the Mustang6G forum point to what documents call the Performance Package Level 2, which will likely build upon the Mustang GT's previously announced Performance Pack. It appears that the new package includes a stiffer suspension, larger Brembo brakes, a bigger radiator, 19-inch wheels, and more. The documents don't describe the Level 2 package in detail, but various order guides allude to the package multiple times and reference a late availability following the 2018 Mustang GT's launch.
Last November, a Mustang6G forum user who claimed to be a Ford dealership employee, first noted the Level 2 package. To his or her credit, Ford has confirmed every other option posted other than the Level 2 package. Then, an ordering guide said a set of 19-inch wheels will be offered with the "GT Performance Package Level 2." Finally, a third ordering guide referenced the same 19-inch wheels and described availability for non-Premium Package Mustang GT Fastbacks. However, it didn't mention the Level 2 package specifically.
We doubt the inclusion of the Performance Package Level 2 in numerous documents is simply a coincidence, but we'll have to wait and see what the Mustang team is cooking. If it's true, Camaro SS 1LE drivers may need to watch their backs.

Bangkok - Rescuers braced for a difficult evacuation for 13 members of a Thai youth football team found alive in a cave nine days after they went missing, as a phone cable was hurriedly fed into the underground chambers in the hope of allowing them to speak to their families for the first time since their ordeal began.
The 12 young boys and their football coach were discovered rake thin and hungry on a mound of mud surrounded by water late Monday, ending an agonising search that captivated a nation.
A team of Thai Navy SEAL divers - including a medic - have joined them on the bank, while rescuers pour over evacuation plans from the Tham Luang cave complex in northern Thailand before heavy rains return and raise the water level.
Much-needed food and medical supplies - including high-calorie gels and paracetamol - reached the group Tuesday as rescuers prepared for a prolonged extraction operation.
"A telephone line will be installed tonight... they (the boys) will be able to talk with their families via military phone," Passakorn Boonyarat, deputy governor of Chiang Rai province, told reporters late Tuesday.
He refused to speculate on how long they might be trapped, but explained that while there are enough provisions for four months, anyone fit and able to leave the cave would be evacuated as soon as possible.
"Any boys who are ready can come out first," via "chamber three" a cavern being used to as a base to store food, oxygen tanks and diving gear as well as plan the complex logistics of how to move 13 weak and inexperienced divers out of a partially-submerged cave.
Time may be against them given the region's incessant monsoon rains.
'Mission impossible'
The boys were discovered at about 10:00pm (1500 GMT) Monday by British divers some 400 metres (1,300 feet) from where they were believed to be stranded several kilometres inside the cave. As the first footage of the kids spread across social media in the early hours of Tuesday, jubilation erupted across a country which has been glued to each twist of the massive rescue operation. Video posted on the Thai Navy SEAL Facebook page, shows one of the boys asking the rescuers to "go outside".In response the British diver says: "No, no not today... many, many people are coming... we are the first."
"We called this 'mission impossible' because it rained every day... but with our determination and equipment we fought nature," Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said Tuesday.
'Unimaginable' rescue
The harrowing task of getting the boys out is fraught with challenges.
An experienced SEAL diver takes around six hours to navigate the rugged, flooded kilometres-long course towards the entrance.
Experts say the risks of panic, drowning or an accident are high for young, scared and physically drained divers trying to negotiate the tight, winding passages.
If diving proves impossible, there is an outside chance a hole can be drilled into the cave to evacuate them or they will have to wait for waters to recede and walk out - the longest of the options.
Relatives led the outpouring of joy at the dramatic discovery of the boys perched on the muddy bank.
"I'm so relieved, though I still don't have the chance to see him... I want to tell him I'm still here waiting," Kieng Khamleu, said of her son Pornchai Khamleung inside the cave.
Another parent said he could hardly believe the good news. "It's unimaginable. I've been waiting for 10 days, I never imagined this day would come," the father of one of the boys said. The "Wild Boar" team became trapped on June 23 after heavy rains blocked the cave's main entrance. Rescuers found their bicycles, football boots and backpacks near the cave's opening, and spotted handprints and footprints further in - leading them to the spot they were eventually found.
Tham Luang cave is one of Thailand's longest, winding 10 kilometres (six miles) and is also one of the toughest to navigate - especially in the wet months. A sign outside the entrance warns visitors not to enter during the rainy season from July to November.
Why can't they swim out?
It is believed that most of the group cannot swim, complicating what would already be a difficult rescue.
Earlier, the Thai military said the boys would need to learn to dive - or wait up to four months for flooding to recede before they could get out of the caves, meaning food would need to be supplied for that time.
Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda later stressed the urgency of the evacuation, adding that rain was forecast "in the next few days", the Bangkok Post reported.
Attempts are being made to reduce the risk of further flooding of the caves by pumping water from the underground system, Mr Anupong said. A phone line is also being installed so the boys can talk to their families
The governor of Chiang Rai, Narongsak Osoththanakorn, said that "no risk" would be taken in rescuing the boys.
"We will not rush to take the lads out of the cave," he told reporters, adding: "Whoever has zero risk first can leave the cave first."
The governor said that requests had been made to build "infrastructure" in the cave leading to the pocket where the teenagers and their coach are located.
The Thai authorities have appealed for donations of full-face scuba diving masks small enough to fit the boys in order to reduce the risk of their breathing apparatus coming loose as they travel through flooded passageways.
How were they found?
Two British rescuer divers who had flown over to join the search operation found the boys on Monday night.
The boys are seen by torchlight sitting on a ledge above water, responding to the divers that all 13 were there and that they were very hungry.
They ask how long they have been underground and whether they can leave now. The divers tell them they have to wait, but say people will come back for them.
One boy replies: "Oh. See you tomorrow."
The search for the group had gripped the nation as it was unclear where they were or whether they were even still alive.
Families of the missing group were ecstatic at news of their discovery.
Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said of the boys' discovery that "everybody is a hero". "Thank you all Thais, thank you all foreigners," he said.
How did they get there?
The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing on 23 June. It is believed they entered the cave when it was dry and sudden heavy rains blocked the exit. They were found on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the mouth of the cave. It is thought the boys could move through parts of the cave in dry conditions but rushing waters clogged the narrow passages with mud and debris, blocking visibility and access.
Service on the Réseau de transport métropolitain (RTM) Vaudreuil-Hudson line was disrupted Monday evening, after a vehicle crashed near the tracks by the Pine Beach Station in Dorval.
Police spokesperson Manuel Couture said the crash happened at around 5:30 p.m. as the vehicle was heading north on Neptune Boulevard, near Herron Road.
The driver lost control and the vehicle veered across Highway 20 and flipped over several times before coming to a stop and bursting into flames near the intersection of Neptune Boulevard and Cardinal Avenue.

The fire was quickly put out.
It is unclear whether anyone was injured in the crash.
Police believe the driver fled the scene, and has yet to be located.
Several trains were delayed and two were cancelled, but at 7 p.m. the RTM tweeted that service was gradually resuming.
British police are investigating six claims of sexual assault or assault by Academy Award-winning actor Kevin Spacey, three more than previously disclosed.
British media reported earlier this year that London's Metropolitan Police force was investigating allegations against the former "House of Cards" star.
Police in Britain don't name suspects until they are charged. Asked about Spacey, the force did not identify him by name but said Wednesday that detectives were investigating allegations of sexual assault alleged to have taken place in London's Westminster borough in 1996 and the western England city of Gloucester in 2013.
The force says three other complaints of sexual assault and one of assault by the same suspect have been made.
Spacey was artistic director of London's Old Vic theater for 11 years until 2015.

This month the universe offers us a solar eclipse, a meteor shower, the swirling Milky Way and beyond.
Day Sky
The Moon will create quite a show on Monday, August 21 with a solar eclipse, passing between the earth and the sun and blocking our view of the sun. A small part of the US will experience a total solar eclipse, while in our area, we will still see an impressive 85 percent blockage. According to the University of Toledo Ritter Planetarium and Brooks Observatory staff, the eclipse begins about 1:02pm with the maximum sun coverage at 2:27pm. Then, as the moon slowly moves away, the sun will be fully visible again by 3:50pm.
Tom Tinta of the Toledo Astronomical Association encourages everyone “to take the time to watch the progression of this phenomenon as solar eclipses we actually get to view occur so very few times in our lifetimes.” Toledoans will see a total solar eclipse in our area in 2024!
A free public gathering for the eclipse viewing will take place at UT on the south lawn between the Ritter Planetarium and McMaster Hall 12:30-4pm. Visitors will be able to enjoy the view using special filtering telescopes and can purchase solar eclipse glasses ($2).
Visit utoledo.edu/nsm/rpbo/ for a campus map, and click on Great American Eclipse for activities, maps and more. Roy Montgomery of the Toledo Astronomical Association cautions those taking photos to use a special filter rated for sun viewing over the lens of your camera or phone.
Night Sky
Join the Toledo Astronomical Association for one of its summer and fall night viewings of the universe. Prepare to feel like you are among the stars as this group of self-proclaimed star geeks share their passion for space at a public viewing at Beaver Creek Preserve (23028 Long Judson Rd in Grand Rapids, woodcountyparkdistrict.org) at 8pm August 26 (weather permitting).
Beaver Creek Preserve, with less light pollution and a larger telescope, is a great area to see the finer details of the Milky Way, several different types of star clusters and deep space. For additional dates and locations for viewings and monthly presentations visit toledoastronomy.org.
On Fire
Settle into the darkness and look upward to catch the remaining beauty of the Perseid meteor shower, considered the Northern Hemisphere's brightest and best of the year. Although the peak of the shower has passed, you will still be able to see 10 to 20 shooting stars per hour now through Thursday, August 24.
Tinta recommends remaining patient until your eyes adjust to the darkness and relaxing your gaze so you can catch meteors in your peripheral vision as well. With the meteors' visible long streaming tails of light lingering in the night sky, this shower really is a wondrous sight to behold. Also visible without a telescope this month will be Jupiter and Saturn, after 9:30pm in the southern sky.
Ndamukong Suh may have a future as a defensive coordinator. He thinks he's cracked the code to the New England Patriots offense.
The defensive tackle told the Miami Herald that New England's “fairly simple offense” was easier to stop after some film review and a mistake-free performance by the Dolphins.
Suh noted the Dolphins' ability to minimize those mistakes provided a stark contract to Week 12 when they lost, 35-17, and had countless coverage busts.
Suh says once you watch tape of Patriots “fairly simple offense” it's easier to stop if you don't make mistakes. — Armando Salguero (@ArmandoSalguero) December 12, 2017
Ndamukong Suh says he feels defense didn't have too many mistakes which is huge considering there were 20 busts in first game. — Armando Salguero (@ArmandoSalguero) December 12, 2017
Suh finished the Dolphins' win with three total tackles, one sack, one tackle for loss, one pass deflection and one quarterback hit.
His efforts were pivotal in disrupting Tom Brady, who finished the game completing 56 percent of his passes for 233 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. He and the Patriots offense were unable to find their dominant form as the Dolphins made Brady uneasy, unconfident and inaccurate throughout the game.

THE world's best photographers are submitting their work to the National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest, putting the year's best nature photography on display.
The competition consists of three categories: Nature, Cities, and People and the grand-prize winner will be awarded $13,200.
National Geographic has been kind enough to share the images - which are available for download on the competition's website - before entries close on May 31.
We have collected some of our favourites pictures from the nature category, which was packed with out-of-this-world wildlife shots. In most cases, the artist has included a brief story about the moment they took the photograph and what it meant to them.
For photographer Niklas Weber, he recounted a mixture of excitement and nervousness when he happened upon a group of crocodiles along the Rio Tarcoles in Costa Rica and whipped out his drone.
"My heart was beating like crazy because I was incredibly excited, on the one hand I was a bit scared for the drone, on the other hand I was so happy about the unique moment," he said.
Another entrant described stumbling across a lone female polar bear having a quiet moment in northern Manitoba who "looked more slumbering house cat than meat-eating predator".
A pair of fighting kangaroos snapped fighting it out in the rain at Mount Kosciuszko by French photographer Augustin Leparmentier has also featured in the competition.
Check out some of our favourites below.

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP)  A Republican lawmaker who defended his description of pregnant women as "hosts" has won approval for his bill that would require women seeking an abortion to first receive written consent from the father.
The House Public Health Committee voted 5-2 in favor of the bill by Rep. Justin Humphrey, despite objections from opponents that the measure is unconstitutional. It now proceeds to the full House.
Humphrey acknowledged that the bill may not pass constitutional muster, but says he wanted to ensure fathers have a role in the abortion process.
A spokeswoman for the abortion rights group Planned Parenthood Great Plains described the bill as a "waste of taxpayer money."

The same committee also approved a separate measure prohibiting abortions based on the diagnosis of a fetal abnormality or Down syndrome.

East Lansing — He might not have a set position just yet, but less than three weeks into preseason camp it's clear redshirt freshman Brandon Randle is making an impact.
To say Michigan State is looking for a playmaker at defensive end to add a spark to a pass rush that was nearly nonexistent last season would be an understatement. Enter Randle, an outside linebacker by trade who redshirted back in 2016.
When camp started a little more than two weeks ago, Randle was being worked at end and had defensive ends coach Mark Snyder singing his praises.
“He may be the surprise of our football team,” Snyder said last week.
That was before Michigan State held its first scrimmage of camp. That was on Thursday, and when head coach Mark Dantonio was asked before practice on Monday which players stood out, Randle was the first he mentioned.
“I think Brandon Randle a guy that you look at right now and is a guy that you see doing some things at defensive end and at linebacker that give you an indication that he is going to be a very good player for us,” Dantonio said.
As much as the 6-foot-2, 231-pound Randle is relying on his physical ability to make a difference on the Spartans' defense, it's his approach to the game that is truly standing out.
At least, that's the way co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach Mike Tressel sees it.
“The thing I see about him that I'm most excited about is he seems to have grown up in terms of the importance of Spartan football, his attention to detail on and off the field. He's not just floating around any more happy to be here. He's like a different person in terms of focus and attention to detail.”
Randle is still working just as much at the STAR linebacker spot and admits he'd prefer to remain a linebacker, but he also understands there's a need at end and thinks he can be a difference-maker.
And when the coaches approached him about the switch, he was all in.
“I wasn't down about it,” Randle said. “At the time a position switch is what we need on the team right now. I was excited to play. I can definitely make some plays there. And playing defensive end definitely helps me at linebacker, for sure, just understanding the whole front seven. I'm happy about it, for sure.”
And it appears he's making the most of working at both positions.
“For me, it's been going pretty good,” Randle said. “The transition wasn't that much of a change for me because I played defensive end in high school, played linebacker in high school. It's just a few things, but it was pretty natural.”
Where he ends up for good remains to be seen, but with nearly three weeks until the opener, the coaching staff isn't rushing anything.
“I think we'll try to keep whatever he does as simple as we can because he will be a first-year player,” Tressel said. “We need to find out where he can make the most impact. Just like any other guy, trying to figure out where a guy can make the most impact.”
Freshmen catching on
It's no surprise Michigan State will be counting on plenty of young players this season, and that's especially true at wide receiver where junior Felton Davis and sophomores Trishton Jackson and Darrell Stewart, the likely starters, have combined for 20 career catches.
After that, wide receiver coach Terrence Samuel said two to three freshmen could join the playing group, including Hunter Rison, Cody White and Laress Nelson.
“Definitely Hunter, he's in the mix,” Samuel said. “But Cody … and Laress. We're looking at those guys right now. C.J. (Hayes) is still picking up the offense. He'll be OK, but just a typical freshman.”

ISLAMABAD, Apr 17 (APP): Advisor to Prime Minister on National History
and Literary Heritage (NHLH), Irfan Siddiqui Monday urged the business community to join hands with the division in its endeavoursto foster book reading culture among the younger generation.
He was speakingduring a meeting with a delegation of Islamabad Chamber
of Commerce and Industries (ICCI) led by President ICCI, Khalid Iqbal Malik at Prime Minister's Office.
“Business community must join hands with the NHLH' division in its
initiatives to revive book reading culture among youth of the country to make them responsible, peace-loving and knowledgeable citizens”, Irfan Siddiqui said.
Irfan Siddiqui said promoting book reading culture through literary
activities are indispensable for establishing peace and harmony in the society.
He said the present government considered the role of industrial,
business and traders community crucial in strengthening country' s economy.
Speaking on the occasion, Khalid Iqbal Malik appreciated the efforts of the present government for overcoming energy crisis and improving security situation in the country.
He assured that ICCI would extend every possible support to the division for the biggest festival `National Book Fair', starting from April 22.
ICCI representatives expressed concerns over trade deficit and reducing level of the country's exports and urged the authorities not to adopt aggressive approach for collecting taxes.
Appreciating the government' policies, they said significant relaxation in mark-up rates and infrastructure development in the country are important steps toward boosting trade activities.
They hoped new budget would be devised keeping in view the problems being faced by traders community.
Fri, Feb 2: Eight people were taken to hospital in serious condition after a bus and a van collided head-on north of Stayner Friday afternoon. Kamil Karamali reports from the scene.
GUJRANWALA:- A trader Naveed Ahmad who was kidnapped by five persons including three former policemen from Shaheenabad area on Monday was recovered from Lahore on Wednesday. The trader was taken to Beghum Kot area of Lahore by the kidnappers. The abductors severely tortured Naveed and demanded Rs500,000 from his family as ransom. On getting information, the Dhaley Police launched a search to arrest the kidnappers and with the help of telephone numbers used by the kidnappers, traced and arrested four accused including a former police sub-inspector and recovered the trader.
ISLAMABAD: A move meant to reflect the state of the common person in Pakistan, a member of the opposition chose a rather peculiar way to register his protest against the federal budget — tearing his clothes at the entrance of the Parliament.
MNA Hamidul Haq of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had intended on tearing his clothes in front of Finance Minister Ishaq Dar during his speech on the floor of the Assembly but was not permitted by Opposition Leader Syed Khursheed Shah.
He wasn't the sole lawmaker ready for a illustrative protest. MNA Shazia Marri of the Pakistan People's Party arrived at the National Assembly wearing a wreath made of fruits and vegetables to manifest her protest against the recent sky-rocketing of prices in the country.
As Mr Haq approached the finance minister in the Parliament, there was an outbreak of excitement in the galleries where reporters assumed he was going to assault the minister.
He was directly in front of the minister when Mr Shah grabbed him and pushed him towards the exit gate.
After not being permitted to register his dissent on the floor of the Parliament, Mr Haq tore his clothes apart in front of the Parliament House in front of journalists.
Talking to a local newspaper, he remarked that he wished to rip his clothes in front of the finance minister to manifest the real condition of a common man. But, he regretted that Mr Shah had prevented him from advancing his protest inside the house, so he had to do it outside the Parliament House.

The third member in Volkswagen's series of I.D. concepts has been revealed.
The concept is the I.D. Crozz, and it makes its world debut on Wednesday at the 2017 Shanghai auto show.
It follows on from the I.D. Buzz minivan unveiled at the 2017 Detroit auto show and I.D. hatchback unveiled at the 2016 Paris auto show. The concepts preview VW's upcoming family of electric cars and are based on the Volkswagen Group's MEB platform for compact electric cars.
In the I.D. Crozz, an electric motor delivering 101 horsepower and 103 pound-feet of torque powers the front axle and another motor delivering 201 hp and 229 lb-ft powers the rear axle, thus creating an all-wheel-drive system. Drive is normally to the rear wheels only, with the front motor only kicking in when sensors detect a loss of traction or if the driver selects AWD mode. The top speed is 112 mph.
Sitting in the vehicle floor is an 83-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery that VW says delivers a range of 311 miles on the European cycle. This should equate to a figure of between 250 and 300 miles for the less lenient EPA cycle. A high-speed charger enables 150-kilowatt charging capacity which enables the battery to be charged to 80 percent capacity in around 30 minutes.
Volkswagen ID Crozz concept, 2017 Shanghai auto show Enlarge Photo
Thanks to clever packaging, the concept offers similar interior space to the stretched Tiguan SUV while being 3.0 inches shorter and 1.9 inches wider. The concept is, however, 2.2 inches wider.
Beyond the electric drive system, VW's I.D. concepts also preview new interface and self-driving technologies. Operating the I.D. Crozz's functions are done via explanatory touch displays, capacitive keypads, and voice and gesture control. These include the electrically adjustable and retractable multifunction steering wheel, a digital instrument cluster, a camera-based electronic rearview mirror, an augmented reality head-up display, and a large tablet.
Should the driver tire of doing the actual driving, he or she can switch to a full self-driving mode (I.D. Pilot mode) by simply touching the “VW” logo on the steering wheel for 3.0 seconds. The wheel then retracts into a flush position within the dash and ambient lighting changes to a relaxing violet hue. VW's self-driving system is able to detect other road users not only by means of its laser sensors, but also with the help of ultrasonic and radar sensors, side area view cameras and a front camera. It also relies on highly-detailed 3D maps to navigate its way around town. The self-driving mode is deactivated by touching the steering wheel logo or by pressing the accelerator or brake pedals.
The first member of VW's new electric car family will be a Golf-sized hatch arriving in 2020 and previewed by the first I.D. concept. Four additional models are thought to be in the works. In addition to the minivan and SUV already previewed by the respective I.D. Buzz and I.D Crozz concepts, VW is thought to be planning a sedan and sporty coupe.

Chinese smartphone maker Huawei managed to gain ground on Samsung and Apple in terms of market share last year, following the problems encountered by the two sector giants, the Gartner consultancy group said on Wednesday.
Over the year as a whole, the Chinese maker saw its sales leap by 26.7 percent, while the South Korean and US rivals both saw their sales decline by 4.3 percent, Gartner said in a study.
As result, Huawei was able to increase its share of the smartphone sector to 8.9 percent in 2016 from 7.3 percent a year earlier, while Samsung saw its market share shrink by two full percentage points to 20.5 percent and Apple's contracted to 14.4 percent from 15.9 percent.
"Chinese makers succeeded in winning market share over last year and Huawei now seems to be the main rival to the two giants, even if the gap remains large," Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann told AFP.
Among the other Chinese smartphone makers are OPPO, BBK Communication Equipment (with its One Plus and Vivo brands), ZTE, Xiaomi and Lenovo.
"We're seeing a very real progression compared with earlier years, when the number three maker and the others had struggled to hold on to a market share of more than four percent," Zimmermann said.
"Huawei looks likely to strengthen its position again this year," she added.
In the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, the launch of the iPhone 7 and Samsung's difficulties with its Note 7 model enabled Apple to take top slot in the market with a share of 17.9 percent or 77 million units sold.
Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the October-December period, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, while Huawei sold 40.8 million phones or a market share of 9.5 percent.
"Preliminary data for the current quarter suggest that Samsung will overtake Apple again. But it's remarkable that Apple can hold on to that sort of share of the market with a closed eco-system," the analyst said.
With regard to the different operating systems, Android, which is used by the large majority of smartphone makers, commands a market share of 81.7 percent, while Apple's iOS operating system of its iPhones and iPads accounts for 17.9 percent of the market.
ST. MORITZ, Switzerland -- Stop worrying, downhill racers. The 2018 Olympic course will be faster than you think.
The new track in South Korea has been criticized -- at a men's test race last year and at the world championships this week -- as being too slow with too many twists and turns.
Not so fast, veteran Olympic course designer Bernhard Russi told The Associated Press.
"It was on purpose to do it like this," Russi said of last February's World Cup downhill, where race winner Kjetil Jansrud of Norway peaked at 113.7 kph (70.6 mph).
If that sounds fast, 2014 Olympic champion Matthias Mayer hit close to 135 kph (84 mph) on Russi's design in the mountains above Sochi. A record speed of 161 kph (100 mph) in World Cup downhills was set by Johan Clarey of France in Wengen, Switzerland, in 2013.
"When you go the first time in a new downhill, you start from the slow side. You don't want to kill the guys," said Russi, the 1972 Olympic champion and silver medalist behind Austrian great Franz Klammer four years later.
The Swiss veteran is skiing's master architect, and he always planned to learn from last year's debut race and a scheduled women's World Cup downhill on the same wide course next month.
"Now we know how much faster we can go, and we will. And the jumps will be longer," Russi said of a men's course that launches them airborne four times.
The main Olympic critic one year ago was Christof Innerhofer of Italy, the 2014 silver medalist, who called the course in Jeongseon "slow motion."
In St. Moritz, it was world championship downhill silver medalist Erik Guay of Canada who wished for a faster, tougher test at the Pyeongchang Olympics.
Guay said the test race had too many slowing turns and was similar to a super-G -- a pointed remark from the 35-year-old Canadian who is the new world champion in that discipline.
"I hope that they set it a little differently," Guay said of the Olympic course. "I think that they should make it flow a little bit better. But the slope itself is great."
The men and women share the Olympic hill but not exactly the same terrain. Russi said there is time to adapt both before the Olympics. The women will compete in World Cup downhill and super-G races on March 4-5.
"Basically, the character will remain the same [as the men's]," Russi said of the women's downhill track. "Maybe the turns will be a little bit tighter. Maybe one, two, three, four more turns. Maybe the jumps a little less big, less long. Perfect for ladies."
Other factors could also change Olympic race-day conditions, such as snow quality and humidity in a mountain region only 40 kilometers (25 miles) inland.
"If the weather is good, I think [the snow] is going to be rather on the hard side, on the icy side," Russi said. "Everything is on track."
In honor of the 25th anniversary of “The Sandlot,” players from the Milwaukee Brewers recreated one of the film's most iconic moments.
In the clip posted to the MLB team's Twitter on Monday, Stephen Vogt stars as Hamilton ‘Ham' Porter, hitting a home run during an afternoon with the gang. The ball soars over the fence and into the area of “The Beast,” with Brett Phillips as Smalls, encountering the dog for the first time. The boys pull him back before goes after the ball and risks his life against the “The Beast,” who in this version is played by a more harmless pup named Hank.
Christian Yelich, Eric Sogard, Hernan Perez, Jeremy Jeffress, Josh Hader, Chase Anderson and Jett Bandy are also featured in the reenactment, which closed with the group humming “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.” The tweet also included the film's classic line, “There are heroes and there are legends. Heroes get remembered but legends never die.”

This isn't the first time a professional team has taken on the famous baseball film. In 2015, the New York Yankees recreated a different “Sandlot” scene, where Smalls realize Babe Ruth and “The Great Bambino” are the same person after using a baseball signed by the legendary player.
“The Sandlot,” which starred Tom Guiry, Mike Vitar, Karen Allen, Denis Leary and James Earl Jones, turns 25 on April 7.
Gov. Haslam visits Wilson County; South Mt. Juliet Road and State Route 109 North discussed as possible future major roadway projects under IMPROVE Act

Tennessee Governor, Bill Haslam, made a special stop in Wilson County last Thursday evening for a town hall meeting, which was organized by State Representative, Susan Lynn, regarding the proposed IMPROVE Act.
Rep. Lynn began the meeting by informing Wilson County citizens of the current funding and taxes which led into talk of the current surplus budget.
She continued breaking down the IMPROVE Act and what it would do for the state and for Wilson County throughout the next eight years if introduced.
“A total of 962 projects throughout the state would begin, including 10 Wilson County road projects,” said Lynn.
Local residents and citizens in attendance of the town hall meeting were concerned of the possible outcome of the tax increase. Lynn stated that the last gas tax increase took place in 1989 in the state of Tennessee. Since that point of time, 30 years have passed by and inflation has taken place causing value and expenses of such projects to drastically change and costs twice as much to repair and maintain such roadways.
The Act could possibly also institute a new open container law into the state of Tennessee,” said Lynn. “The proposed Act could possibly take away a large penalty that has to be paid by the state in regards for not having such a law.”
The Hall income tax is required to be done away with by the year 2022. The proposed act would quicken up the process of extinguishing the income tax.
Gov. Haslam appeared an hour into the meeting for the meeting at the Wilson County Courthouse after being out of state for other business in which he had flown in from directly.
Haslam explained to Wilson County residents the meaning of the IMPROVE Act.
“The new proposed Act would mean tax cuts and a gas tax increase, while also addressing transportation funding concerns and issues,” said Haslam. “We're only trying to keep up with our roads, and it costs twice as much when we only have half as much money.”
The results of the IMPROVE Act would be an increase in the road user fee or gas tax by 0.07 cents per gallon of gas. For a gallon of diesel fuel, an increased amount of 0.12 cents would be experienced by fleet drivers.
An increase of $5.00 for car registration fees for the average passenger vehicle would be implemented. This would bring in $278 million dollars in new funds to support backlogged transportation projects.
Balancing out the increase in the other discussed taxes would be major tax cuts on food and manufacturing in the county.
If passed, the IMPROVE Act would most likely include State Route 109, a popular debated roadway with over decades of requests from everyday travelers to widen. The project would begin at the intersection of Highway 70 (Lebanon Road) and State Route 109 and would be projected to end at the Wilson County-line, where the new four-lane bridge overpass into Sumner County begins.
The project would be an estimated 7.5 miles of road work and widening that would cost an estimated 18.5 million to complete.
South Mt. Juliet Road is another main road in Wilson County that state and local government have studied.
“When Interstate-40 or I-24 gets congested or backed up with standstill traffic, drivers automatically bail to Hobson Pike or South Mt. Juliet where most of all the traffic jams up during these situations,” explained Rep. Lynn. “The project would cost somewhere around $25.4 million to construct the widening between Central Pike and Providence Way on North Mt. Juliet Road.”
Other mentioned Wilson County projects would possibly include two I-40 projects in which would decrease traffic congestion along Interstate 840 to Highway 70. The other project would include the areas between State Route 109 and 840. The estimated total for both projects would be expected somewhere around $94 million.
Another Mt. Juliet congested area on Highway 70 that was mentioned was the intersection of Park Glen Drive and Bender's Ferry Road. Between schools and travelers heading to work during the morning hours and daytime workers making their way home around the same time as dinner, the Mt. Juliet area is known for congested traffic most mornings and afternoons.
The intersection of Central Pike from Old Hickory Boulevard, outside of Mt. Juliet in Hermitage, was also discussed, as well as a new possible interchange at I-40 and Central Pike. The interchange at I-40 and Central Pike is listed under the interstate program and estimated at a total of $14.2 million in construction.
ISLAMABAD - Finance Minister Ishaq Dar battled to finish his job on Wednesday as a killingly teasing opposition taunted and distracted him during the concluding hours of the debate on the national budget for the fiscal year 2017-2018.
Throughout the days that the members of the National Assembly were expected to debate on the budget, the opposition parties boycotted the proceedings.
They always turned up, took the microphone, spoke against the government and walked away – leaving the treasury lawmakers to highlight the “extraordinary budget”.
Outside the hall, the opposition members saw the financial plan a total disappointment, which would further corner the common man. All through the debate, the opposition lawmakers chose to either discuss the budget outside the parliament or on the television screens.
On Wednesday, they played more pranks.
Opposition leader Syed Khurshid Shah said that the whole opposition was waiting for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to brief them on the Gulf crisis after his visit to Saudi Arabia.
Sharif met Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz this week as part of Pakistan's efforts to defuse the Saudi-Qatar tension.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had earlier cut diplomatic ties with Qatar accusing it of supporting terror networks.
Qatar denied the allegations and appealed for talks.
The prime minister, who has personal ties with both the Saudi and Qatari royals, may soon visit Qatar or Kuwait to carry the process further.
After his meeting with the Saudi king, PM Sharif had hoped the current impasse in the Gulf would be resolved soon.
Shah said that Prime Minister Sharif should have attended the National Assembly proceedings to take the House into confidence on the Gulf crisis.
Thereafter, the opposition tried to distract the finance minister as he hurried through the formalities to get the Finance Bill 2017 passed.
Engineer Hamidul Haq Khalil stole the show as he came right in front of Dar, put his finger on his lips requesting silence and suddenly tore apart his own shirt, in protest against the budget.
The House burst into laughter but Dar tried to keep his calm.
The other opposition members sat near the speaker's dais – waiting for the PM to brief them on the national and international affairs.
The PM who will appear before the joint investigation team in connection with the Panama leaks scandal today (June 15) was never expected to come.
Dar however, announced that Prime Minister Sharif will appear before the JIT and had asked party workers to stay away from the JIT secretariat.
He rejected opposition's allegations that the state institutions were creating hurdles in the proceedings of the JIT constituted to probe Panama Papers case against the Sharif family.
“The state institutions are in fact providing all the required material to the JIT. The PM will appear before the JIT,” Dar said.
He said, while the government respected the process of investigation, there were doubts and suspicions over the process. “We fully respect the law and the constitution,” Dar added.
The opposition opted to walk away as the National Assembly passed Finance Bill 2017 with majority vote to give effect to measures announced in the annual budget proposals for fiscal 2017-2018.
The bill was moved by Minister for Law and Justice Zahid Hamid and adopted by a House with empty opposition benches.
When the session was prorogued by the chair, the finance minister got something to cheer about. His colleagues from the treasury benches gathered around him to take selfies. At least a smile as the curtain fell.

Ride-hailing company suspends all road-testing of such vehicles in U.S. and Canada
Police say a woman walking outside a crosswalk on Sunday night in the Phoenix area when she was hit by the self-driving car. (@zombieite/Flickr)
A self-driving Uber vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in a suburb in Phoenix, Ariz., in the first fatality involving a fully autonomous test vehicle, prompting the ride-hailing company Monday to suspend all road-testing of such autos in the U.S. and Canada.
Depending on who is found to be at fault, the accident could have far-reaching consequences for the development of self-driving vehicles, which have been billed as potentially safer than human drivers.

The Volvo was in self-driving mode with a human operator behind the wheel when a woman walking outside a crosswalk in Tempe on Sunday night was hit, police said. The woman, identified as Elaine Herzberg, 49, died at a hospital.
Uber suspended all of its self-driving vehicle testing in the Phoenix area, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto.
The testing has been going on for months as automakers and technology companies compete to be the first with the technology.
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed condolences on his Twitter account and said the company is working with local law enforcement on the investigation.
The federal government has voluntary guidelines for companies that want to test autonomous vehicles, leaving much of the regulation up to states.
But Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao also has said technology and automobile companies need to allay public fears of self-driving vehicles, citing a poll showing that 78 percent of people fear riding in autonomous vehicles
The number of states considering legislation related to autonomous vehicles gradually has increased each year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In 2017 alone, 33 states introduced legislation.
California is among those that require manufacturers to report any incidents to the motor vehicle department during the testing phase. As of early March, the agency received 59 such reports.
The Islamic State (IS) militant group has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack on a nightclub in Istanbul on New Year's Day that killed 39 people and wounded dozens of others.
The IS said in a statement on January 2 that a “soldier of the caliphate” had carried out the attack where “Christians celebrate their apostate holiday.”
The Turkish dailies Hurriyet and Karar had reported earlier on January 2 that Turkish security officials suspected the IS was involved in the massacre. The newspapers also reported that the suspect was likely from Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan.
A manhunt continues in Turkey for the gunman, who escaped the scene.
Officials said 24 of the 39 people killed were foreigners. Sixty-nine people were wounded in the attack and four of them are reportedly in critical condition.
A source at the Russian Consulate in Istanbul told TASS that one of the victims was a Russian woman who had originally been identified as a citizen of Azerbaijan.
Other foreigners that have been identified among the killed include at least one Saudi citizen, a Canadian, at least two Jordanians, three Iraqis, three Lebanese, at least one Tunisian, two Indians, an Arab-Israeli, a Belgian-Turkish dual national, and one Libyan.

Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children has released a new video to honour fathers on Sunday as part of their SickKids VS Campaign, which highlights the courage of patients and their families.
The video DadStrong tells the true story of Frank Soares, a man with incredible strength that will do whatever it takes to make sure his daughter Naya knows daddy will be her rock no matter what.
“[Naya] was born with many complex heart defects,” said Soares. “Her liver was outside of her abdomen. She also had a few spinal abnormalities, scoliosis and a shorter limb.”
Like many dads, Soares works hard every day for his family. But for the last 14 months, he has also been working the night shift relieving his wife Stephanie at SickKids to make sure his little girl knows her daddy is there watching over her while she sleeps.
“Powerless to be a parent and not have control of your child,” said Soares. “My child's life was in the hands of the doctors and nurses that she has seen every day. I just had to be there.”
Finally last month, Naya was discharged from SickKids. She went home for the first time to be with her twin sister, her mother and father.
“[Naya] is doing great. She's thriving at home and she's going to continue doing rehab to get over her stroke symptoms, but she's doing great,” said Soares.
“SickKids is a second home for sure. They took care of my daughter. They made sure she was okay.”
When asked if Naya was a gift to him this Father's Day, Soares said, “God gave me this gift, maybe to show me how strong human life is and how much I took it for granted maybe. But she definitely is my gift – both of them.”
Paris Jackson has been awarded a restraining order against an alleged stalker.
The 20-year-old actress - who is the daughter of the late musical icon Michael Jackson - was handed the temporary document in court on Tuesday (03.07.18) in Los Angeles against 23-year-old Nicholas Stevens, whom she has accused of stalking her.
According to TMZ, Nicholas must now stay at least 100 yards away from Paris until at least July 24, when the temporary restraining order is due to expire and a court hearing is due to take place.
In court documents obtained by the publication, the 'Star' actress claimed that Nicholas showed up at a recording studio she was working at in June and had a brief interaction with her, in which he is said to have told her he'd once waited outside the building for 15 hours in order to see her.
The papers go on to state that Paris' unnamed friend allegedly confronted Nicholas by asking what he was doing there, to which the man is claimed to have replied: "What the f**k does it look like I'm doing here? I'm stalking your b***h."
Police were then called to the scene after Nicholas allegedly told Paris and her friend: "By midnight it will all be over ... the way it ends is with her or with a shotgun."
Documents state Nicholas had also tweeted at the young star too, in a message which claimed the pair were "soulmates".
The news comes at a stressful time for Paris, who last week mourned the death of her grandfather Joe Jackson, who passed away at the age of 89 after a battle with cancer.
Paris posted a lengthy message on social media addressed to Joe, in which she praised him as "the strongest man" she knows.
Part of her message read: "you are the strongest man i know. your life's work will go down in history, as will you, to be known as one of the greatest patriarchs to ever live. i will cherish every moment with you til the day i die, especially our last moments. being able to hold your hand, lay with you and cuddle you, give you kisses all over your cheeks and forehead, meant more to me than you'll ever know.
nbn™, the organisation building and operating Australia's National Broadband Network (NBN), has reported annual revenues of AU$1,001m for the year ending June 30, 2017, and says it's ahead of target for construction and uptake.
The company says that as of June 30th it had 5, 713,350 premises ready for service, of which 2,443,133 had activated services. When the company looks at the takeup rate over the 18 months that elapse between NBN connections becoming available and ye olde PSTN-based internet access being switched off, 75 per cent of premises makes an NBN connection. That's one point ahead of its 74 per cent target.

But CEO Bill Morrow acknowledged that not all customers are happy, a problem he mostly laid at the door of retailers who he said have varying processes for connecting customers and are only just starting to explain to customers that peak speeds won't be available 24 hours a day.
While Morrow did not name retailers he said are doing better than others, he said nbn™ has collected statistics that tell it which are problem children. He also revealed the slide below in order to explain why nbn™ can't be held accountable for all poor customer experiences, but also said the company is aware that its own efforts to support both retailers can improve.
The buck stops … somewhere? Click here to embiggen
The CEO also attributed recent restiveness among users to problems bedding in new carriage technologies. Morrow said this happens each time nbn™ adopts a new technology and that with hybrid fibre-coax (HFC) and fibre-to-the-curb (FTTC) builds now accelerating he hopes to learn from the glitch period on other builds to smooth things out this time around.
On the financial front, the company is still losing money but says revenue is growing fast and eroding losses quickly.

The company wants Australians to concentrate on the EBIT number, which it says best represents its true status. The company was also pleased to report average revenue per user of $43, and forecast that would climb as demand for more downloads arrives and business services become available.
The presentation also revealed that fewer users of the NBN are signing up for the fastest connections on offer. For the year ending June 30th just 13 per cent buy 100Mbps-capable fixed line services, down one per cent compared to FY 2016. 25Mbps services now account for 53 per cent of users, up four points, with 12Mbps users down to 29 per cent of users, compared to last year's 32 pe r cent.
Overall, Morrow's remarks continue nbn™'s recent push-back on those who say its government-mandated mixed media network build is the source of end-users' performance problems, in favour of an argument that says nbn™ has complex interrelationships with retailers and cannot bear sole responsibility for end-user experience. It also continues nbn™'s consistently rosy view of its progress.
But Morrow also mentioned that the company has one third of its regional build left, and two thirds of its metropolitan build to go. Those efforts will include re-wiring users who currently enjoy 100Mbps HFC services, but will likely get worse service from nbn™ and are already signalling they'll scream long and loud if their services degrade. The company also has many premises to connect that it has put in the too-hard basket for now and also faces implementation of FTTC on a scale seldom-if-ever attempted anywhere, ever.
We'll know how the company plans to tackle those challenges in coming days when it launches a new corporate plan. Grab some popcorn. There's plenty more nbn™ fun to come! ®

LIMA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Southern Copper Corp surprised the market by reporting a $287.5 million net loss in the fourth quarter on Friday, citing a $743.3 million one-time payment related to U.S. tax reform.
Analysts had forecast a $419 million net profit for the company in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The Arizona-based company, controlled by Grupo Mexico , said that without the tax adjustment it would have posted $455.8 million in net profit. In the last quarter of 2016, Southern earned $171.9 million.

Burial's getting busy again! Thus far this year, the mercurial UK producer has the Subtemple EP and the “Rodent” single, as well as a couple of remixes. And now Resident Advisor reports that he'll release a new EP with two tracks, “Pre Dawn” and “Indoors,” later this month. Above Board Distribution has 90-second audio clips of both tracks, and they both sound like immersive, ghostly takes on four-on-the-floor house music and old-school UK rave, which means they're closer to straight-up club music than Burial usually gets. You can hear those audio clips here.
The Pre Dawn/Indoors EP is out 10/27 on NonPlus.

SAMARA-Brazil superstar Neymar brushed off his critics after firing the five-time World Cup winners to victory over Mexico on Monday and into a quarter-final showdown with Belgium.
Neymar scored one goal and created another as his increasingly impressive Brazil side overpowered the Mexicans 2-0 in sweltering conditions. But Neymar's sparkling performance was tarnished by yet another example of his tendency to overreact to seemingly innocuous challenges.
The latest chapter in a bulging catalogue of histrionic behaviour came in the second half, when Mexico midfielder Miguel Layun appeared to step on his ankle as he lay prone.
Neymar writhed around and convulsed as if he had received an electric shock. "I think it's a shame for football," Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio lamented afterwards, saying Neymar's antics had wasted precious time. "We wasted a lot of time because of one single player ... we lost our style in the second half, because of the referee. This is a very bad example for the world and the world of football."
As social media platforms exploded with fans angrily accusing Neymar of cheating, former England striker Alan Shearer described the Paris Saint-Germain star as "absolutely pathetic." "There is no doubting the ability of him. He is a magnificent player," said Shearer, who is working in Russia for Britain's BBC. "But it really is pathetic when he is rolling around as if he is in agony."
Yet Neymar shrugged off the criticism after his man-of-the-match performance, claiming it was motivated to "undermine me." "I don't care much for criticism, or praise, because this can influence your attitude," he said. "In the last two matches I didn't talk to the press because I don't want to. I just have to play, help my teammates, help my team."
Brazil defender Thiago Silva meanwhile heaped praise on Neymar, who only returned to playing shortly before the tournament following an injury layoff of more than three months. "It's magnificent how he's playing, especially after three and a half months on the sidelines," PSG teammate Silva said. "It's very difficult to come back the way he's done."
Against Mexico, Neymar burst into life after Brazil weathered early pressure from opponents determined to end a 32-year wait to reach the quarter-finals. The 26-year-old talisman struck the opening goal on 51 minutes to Brazil 1-0 up.
The Brazil talisman drew several defenders as he ran across the edge of the area with the ball at his feet, before passing to Willian and continuing his run into the box. Willian duly returned the favour and Neymar was on hand to poke the Chelsea midfielder's superb delivery past Guillermo Ochoa. As Mexico lost heart, Brazil could have added more than probing counters carved open Mexico's defence, Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro notably testing Ochoa with a drive the 'keeper blocked. The result was settled when Layun lost possession in the dying minutes. Neymar went on a counter-attack that drew Ochoa from his goal before finding Roberto Firmino with the finest of touches from the outside of his right boot.
With only two goals, Neymar is lagging well behind England star Harry Kane's tournament-leading tally of five goals. But Silva is hoping Neymar emulates the recent feats of other Paris Saint-Germain clubmates Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe on his way to taking Brazil further. "It's true, I said this before this match," added Silva. "I hope he listens to me in the quarter-finals."

Inspired by much-loved US author and illustrator Lane Smith's real-life encounter with a marauding bear in the woods near his home in rural Connecticut, this playful, witty and chaotic tale imagines how one creature's idea of a perfect day might not be quite like another's.
The animals in Bert's garden are having a perfect day. Whether basking in the warmth of the sun, nibbling on a fresh yellow corn-on-the-cob, or cooling off in a clear pool of water, it is a truly beautiful afternoon for all of them. Well, it was! Someone else is here and he's not a welcome visitor… a big, bad bear is also hoping for a perfect day. Is he going to spoil it for everyone else?
Lane's fresh and fun-filled story about a group of appealing animal characters and their (not so) perfect day offers little ones an exciting and important lesson about contrast, difference and diversity.
Bold, action-packed illustrations provide a visual foil to the earlier serenity of the morning garden, creating a gentle sense of suspense and surprise as the story progresses.

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - The opening weekend of the Premier League season ended with an emphatic win as Manchester United beat West Ham United 4-0 at Old Trafford on Sunday but manager Jose Mourinho was wary of fuelling talk of his team as title contenders.
With new striker Romelu Lukaku scoring twice and another close-season signing, midfielder Nemanja Matic, making a dominating debut, the win appeared to give credence to United's placing with many bookmakers as second favourites, behind neighbours Manchester City.
Mourinho played it all down, however, saying: "Last season we were also top of the league in the first match and we finished sixth so this means nothing.
"It just means we played well and confidence levels will be high and now our challenge is to keep these confidence levels," added the former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss, who is starting his second season at Old Trafford.
"We finished the season winning the Europa League and qualifying for the Champions League. We start the second season with a very good performance at home. We had many players on the pitch with a very good game. The fans have reasons to be optimistic.

"But for me, with years and years of experience in the Premier League, my feet are on the ground and I am calm," he said.
United have not been in title contention since the retirement of Alex Ferguson with the Premier League trophy in his hands in 2013.
There have, though, been false dawns.

In Mourinho's first game last season, they won 3-1 at Bournemouth, prompting instant talk of a new era after the disappointing Louis van Gaal reign but consistency did not follow and United finished sixth.
Four years ago, in David Moyes's first match in charge, they won 4-1 at Swansea but their manager did not survive the season as United ended seventh.
Mourinho's attitude is therefore wise and with 37 games of the season to come -- along with a Champions League campaign -- he knows there will be moments of doubt and questioning.

Still, there is an air of optimism around Old Trafford and not without reason.
"Many times last season we deserved to win and didn't so the fact we won the match was the most important thing," he said, referring to the 10 home draws last term.
"But I think the performance based on the confidence levels was really high. I am not going to say the performance was perfect because it was not. We made our mistakes and have room for improvement but it was a solid performance.
"I liked the attitude in the second half to try and score more goals. After 2-0 we had a period of relaxation and they created a couple of situations in the box but again (we showed) good confidence levels and desire to play until the end," he said.
Perhaps conscious of criticism of his tactical approach as negative, Mourinho could not resist noting the way his team had finished the game with two late goals.
"The reality is that in the last part of the game, instead of being boring and controlling the game, we scored a third goal and we could enjoy it."

TORONTO – Relatives of murdered seniors, along with advocacy and health-care groups, are among four dozen applicants seeking to participate in a public inquiry sparked by a nurse who killed eight elderly long-term-care residents in Ontario.
Commissioner Eileen Gillese will hear their requests for standing – a status that gives them the right to call and question witnesses – in St. Thomas, Ont., on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Ontario government set up the Long-Term Care Homes Public Inquiry in August after Elizabeth Wettlaufer was convicted of eight counts of first degree-murder, four counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated assault. Wettlaufer had pleaded guilty in June and was sentenced to life in prison with no eligibility for parole for 25 years.

The 50-year-old injected her victims with insulin while they were in her care at three Ontario long-term care facilities and a private home between 2007 and 2016.
Alex Van Kralingen, a Toronto-based lawyer, who represents the “affected parties” group – five relatives or close friends of Wettlaufer's victims – said his clients are obviously looking for answers as to how Wettlaufer got away with what she did for so long. But there's much more, he said.
“Ultimately, the hope is that this is going to be a springboard into a conversation about how we treat long-term care in this province,” Van Kralingen said in an interview Monday.
“It can be an opportunity to be transformational … and could be the jump-start for political actors to start making changes to make sure that vulnerable seniors, who have given a lot to this country, are not placed in a situation where they should be scared about the quality of the care they get and the people who are taking care of them.”

Some of the families, Van Kralingen said, also wonder about tightening access to potentially lethal drugs such as insulin that can be used to hide an intent to harm.
In addition to submitted written materials, applicants will have a few minutes to explain why they believe they should be allowed to participate – either because they have a substantial and direct interest in the proceedings, or because they have information or insights that would help the inquiry.
They will also, if needed, have a chance to make a pitch to have the government fund their participation.
Despite having been fired twice during her career – the first time in 1995 – Wettlaufer managed to retain her licence as a registered nurse. Her crimes only came to light when she confessed to a mental-health professional last fall.

One professional group seeking standing is the College of Nurses of Ontario, which has come under criticism for allowing Wettlaufer to keep working. It's another key issue that needs thorough exploration, Van Kralingen said: “Should a regulator be involved and figure out the circumstances in which somebody was fired? Where's the regulator's role?”
Other applicants for standing are the Ontario Nurses Association and the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario – groups critical of what they see as stingy government funding and staffing requirements in long-term-care facilities. Provincial Long-Term Care Minister Eric Hoskins has already introduced legislation aimed at tightening oversight of the sector.
According to court records, Wettlaufer was an addict who found coping with elderly patients difficult and caring for 32 residents overnight at Caressant Care in Woodstock, Ont., overwhelming. She confessed to police that she would feel a “red surge” that made her think God was directing her murderous actions.

Caressant Care, where most of Wettlaufer's killings occurred, and Meadow Park in London, Ont., where one of the deaths took place, are seeking to participate in the inquiry, as are activist groups such as the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly.
The inquiry's mandate calls on Gillese – a justice of the Ontario Court of Appeal – to delve into the events that led to Wettlaufer's crimes, along with the circumstances and contributing factors that allowed the crimes to occur. Those include looking at policies, procedures, practices, accountability and oversight mechanisms.
Gillese is expected to announce her decision on standing in mid-January and begin hearing from witnesses in June. She is slated to issue her report on her findings and recommendations aimed at avoiding a recurrence on July 31, 2019.

The Broncos' defensive line has been hit hard by injuries this offseason.
Nose tackle Kyle Peko went down with a broken foot in July and he's currently on the physically unable to perform list. Fellow nose tackle Billy Winn is on the injured reserve list after suffering a season-ending knee injury against the Bears in the team's preseason opener.
Defensive end Derek Wolfe is recovering from an ankle sprain and fellow defensive end Jared Crick is dealing with a back issue. Outside linebackers Shaq Barrett (hip) and Shane Ray (wrist) — players that sometimes line up with their hands in the dirt — are also injured.
With all those players injured, here's how Denver's (healthy) defensive line depth chart looks entering Week 2 of preseason:
DE: Zach Kerr, Shelby Harris
NT: Domata Peko, Tyrique Jarrett, Nelson Adams
DE: Adam Gotsis, Shakir Soto
The Broncos selected Florida State defensive end DeMarcus Walker in the second round of this year's NFL draft, but he's been practicing at outside linebacker with Ray and Barrett injured. Coach Vance Joseph said after practice Monday that Walker won't be moving back to the defensive line anytime soon.
While Denver obviously doesn't want to see players injured, the team will be able to get a good look at Kerr and second-year defender Gotsis in the coming weeks. Kerr had been competing with Crick for more playing time this summer while Gotsis has been serving as a rotational lineman. Now both players could be asked to start, at least temporarily.
At nose tackle, undrafted rookie Jarrett appears capable of serving as Domata's backup until Kyle is healthy enough to play again.
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The surge in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields on Friday after a government report showed that wages' rising smartly is just a “delayed reaction” to stronger economic growth that has been ongoing for some time, a top policymaker said on Friday.
“Markets sometimes take a while to get going and then they move more quickly,” San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams told reporters after a talk here.
“Some of this adjustment seems to be a realization the economy's doing really well, and obviously with the tax cuts that's going to add further stimulus in the next years, and if anything the inflation data are heading in the right way,” Williams said.
U.S. stocks fell for a second straight day on Friday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day in two years. But Williams was upbeat, calling current financial conditions, even after the rise in bond yields and the fall in stocks, “incredibly positive.”
Applications are now open to become a GrassCheck pilot farmer for two AgriSearch projects: Precision Grazing and Beef from Grass.
Working with research partners AFBI, these projects will recruit new dairy farms and beef farms from across Northern Ireland to monitor grass growth and quality across a range of production systems and land types.
In Northern Ireland, there is a huge variation in soil type and a range of microclimates, resulting in large variations in localised grass growth, rainfall, soil moisture levels and temperature.
AgriSearch Project Officer Elizabeth Earle commented: “In 2017, we witnessed huge variability in grass growth and grazing conditions across the country. This has significantly impacted on animal performance and feed costs on-farm.”
Previous work carried out by AFBI has demonstrated that improving grassland utilisation by one tonne per hectare on a dairy farm is worth an additional profit of £334/ha/year and on a beef farm £204/ha/year.”
Elizabeth highlighted: “It is vitally important that we continue to both research and monitor this variation in order to provide Northern Ireland livestock farmers with the necessary information required to make effective nutrient and grassland management decisions on-farm.”
The new Precision Grazing GrassCheck project will seek to examine not only the variability in climatic conditions, grass growth, utilisation, and quality across Northern Ireland but also examine the potential use of novel, labour saving precision technologies, such as reflectance imaging and laser sensing to assess grass yield and quality.”
AgriSearch and AFBI are seeking to recruit six new additional pilot dairy farmers to take part in this new Precision Grazing (GrassCheck) project. AgriSearch will also be filling some farm vacancies in the current ongoing Beef from Grass project.
Farmers will be required to measure grass weekly throughout the grazing season. Regular grass samples will also be taken for analysis. Each of the pilot farms will also have an automatic weather station installed, which will measure key metrological data including temperature, rainfall and soil moisture. This information will be published online and in the farming press on a weekly basis.
Interested farmers can download application forms and information packs from the AgriSearch website www.agrisearch.org.
Applications are particularly welcome from Armagh, North West Londonderry and South Antrim areas. Deadline for applications is 12 noon on Monday, 19th February 2018.
If you have any general queries then contact Elizabeth Earle (AgriSearch) on 028 9268 1514, for Dairy specific queries contact Debbie McConnell (AFBI) 028 9268 1530 and for Beef specific enquiries contact Francis Lively (AFBI) 028 9268 1552.
The Precision Grazing project is funded by AgriSearch and by DAERA under the Research Challenge Fund.
SUDBURY, Ont. — Police say a drug seizure in northern Ontario resulted in the arrest of a man suspected of murder in Belize, as well as other crimes in Toronto.
The Greater Sudbury Police Service says the man was arrested on Friday as part of a drug bust at a local home.
A check on the man's identity, which was not released, found he was wanted for a number of alleged crimes further afield.
They say he's wanted in Belize on one count of first-degree murder, but did not provide details of the case.

When Greg meets Sylvia—a stray dog—in a park in New York, he takes a liking to her and decides to bring her home. However, Greg's wife Kate does not share his fondness for Sylvia. As Greg's love for Sylvia grows, a romantic triangle of sorts forms between Greg, Kate and Sylvia.
Gurney's play has become legendary for its hilarious exploration of the relationships humans form with their pets, according to a news release. With Sylvia portrayed by a human actor, the laughs abound as the unfolding story explores love and relationships of all kinds. Funny, sweet and very much geared towards adults (in both language and content), the course of this play changes everyone involved.
NST's production is directed by Rebecca Poole. Leanne Nickon played Sylvia in an earlier NST production and returns in this production as Kate. Randall Simons is Greg. Matt Murphy plays Tom, Phyllis and Leslie. And Nina Robinson-Poole plays the incomparable Sylvia.
Performances at the Blue Hill Town Hall are on June 16, 17, 23, 24, 30 and July 1 at 7 p.m. and June 25 at 3 p.m. Reservations are available at newsurrytheatre.org or by calling 200-4720.

The United States voted against a UN resolution condemning America's economic embargo against Cuba on Wednesday. The embargo resolution was overwhelmingly approved in the 193-member General Assembly by a vote of 191-2, with Israel joining the U.S. UN Ambassador Nikki Haley said the American people had chosen a new president and the United States would vote against any resolution calling for the lifting of the embargo "as long as the proceeds from trade with Cuba go to prop up the dictatorial regime responsible for denying those (human) rights."

THE talk ahead of Sheffield Wednesday's final game of 2016 had all been about Fernando Forestieri.
Perhaps understandably so considering both the events surrounding last August's trip to Norwich City and the transfer window being just hours away from reopening, his absence from the squad sparked wild rumours that the Argentinian could be on his way from Hillsborough.
Club officials quickly moved to stress this was not the case and that Forestieri had picked up a muscle injury on Boxing Day, a point head coach Carlos Carvalhal forcibly underlined after seeing Adam Reach rescue a point with a stoppage-time equaliser.
Wednesday's talisman is expected to return today at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers and that will surely come as a big relief to what is expected to be Hillsborough's biggest crowd of the season.
Certainly, the Owls are a much poorer side without Forestieri as was underlined by the stumbling efforts on New Year's Eve that, but for Reach's last-gasp strike, would have ended in deserved defeat.
Without Forestieri, Wednesday were predictable and leaden-footed.
Only Barry Bannan, following a switch to the left flank after half-time, posed any semblance of a threat to a Preston side still reeling from a 4-1 thrashing by Leeds United just five days earlier.
Steven Fletcher and Atdhe Nuhiu, Carvalhal's preferred strike force in the absence of Forestieri and the injured Gary Hooper, barely had a touch in the first half. A re-think then saw Nuhiu taken off at the interval and Reach pushed up front, but Wednesday still offered little until that late, late strike from Reach with what was Wednesday's first effort on target all afternoon.
A midfield that, Bannan apart once moved into a wider role as part of that half-time re-jig, is far too alike did not help the visitors' cause, but there was no escaping the feeling that things would have been very different had Forestieri been available. Hence the concerns surrounding the absence of someone who went AWOL before that trip to Norwich amid reported interest from Derby County.
“Fernando is injured,” said Carvalhal before elaborating further on Forestieri's future in response to an enquiry as to whether he will be leaving. “I am absolutely sure that is not the case. I can guarantee that. You know, in the past, I have never lied.
“What I say is true. That is the case now. We hope he can recover for Monday and that is important because it gives us more options.”
That Forestieri will return today to a team still occupying a play-off place is thanks to the refusal of Reach to be denied during a ‘94th-minute' goalmouth scramble.
After having a left-foot effort blocked by a scrum of white shirts as the ball pinballed around the six-yard area, the wideman was handed a second opportunity.
This time, Reach swung his right foot and the connection was so sweet that there was nothing a scrambling Preston defence could do to prevent the ball hitting the back of the net.
It was harsh on North End, who had gone ahead 13 minutes from time when the impressive Greg Cunningham once again wriggled clear on the left before drilling a low cross that Sam Hutchinson could only turn into his own net.
Coming on the back of Kieren Westwood having been called into action several times to save the Owls, Preston's lead was deserved but, thanks to Reach, one that was not destined to last.
With Wigan Athletic holding Derby County to a goalless draw at the I-Pro Stadium, it was enough to keep Wednesday in the top six, but their goal-scorer insists that should not be the end of the club's ambitions this season.
“We have done well, but there is always room for improvement,” said Reach. “With the strength of our squad, we should be chasing the top two.
“A lot of the top teams dropped points – Derby, Huddersfield and so on – so it was a bit of an opportunity missed. We were all slightly disappointed afterwards not to capitalise on the opportunity.
“For me, it has been a great 12 months. I am at a great club and looking forward to really pushing on with Sheffield Wednesday. Hopefully, that means Premier League.”
Carvalhal's men start 2017 sitting 10 points adrift of second-placed Brighton & Hove Albion but the 23-year-old added: “I don't think it has to be play-offs. We are more than capable of finishing in the top two. We went to (leaders) Newcastle and beat them to prove that.
“It is not over. There are 20-odd games left and you can quickly find yourselves moving up the table. It is going to be an interesting second half of the season.”
If a tilt at the top two is to become a reality in the new year, three points against a badly out of form Wolves today is imperative.
Carvalhal plans changes ahead of a second game in a little over 48 hours.
“This time of year is difficult for all coaches,” added the Portuguese. “This is something that happens only in England. The rules of UEFA say the players must have a minimum 72 hours between games, but here in England it is different.
“The danger is that players are in very high risk of injuries. It is maybe time for the medical departments to make reports about this.
“It is not injuries after the second game, but the chance of injuries one or two weeks later.
“If I could, I would change 11 players. Any coach in the world would say the same.
“Over the weekend, we analyse our soldiers. See who is dead or alive. We will try and manage that.”
FIFA U-17 World Cup kicks off today in Navi Mumbai and New Delhi. And as India will play its first ever global football match today as it takes on US, a country that has participated in all of the 16 editions of the U-17 World Cup it seems apt to look at the players to watch out for in this tournament.
1. Yacine Adli, France
Paris has emerged as one of the most promising cities for football talent. Yacine Adli has just signed a professional contract with PSG (the club Adli has been with since 2013) and fits into a devastating France lineup. The young midfielder, an Adrien Rabiot lookalike, is aiming to become one of the few homegrown players who make it through to the first team at one of the richest clubs in the world.
Reprise de l'entraînement ! 🔴🔵 #AOSL #ARNK #DETERMINÉ A post shared by Adli Yacine (@adliyacine) on Jul 21, 2017 at 11:08am PDT
2. Andrew Carleton, USA
Part of a fearsome America trio, with Timothy Weah and Josh Sargeant, Carleton is homegrown through and through. He debuted for MLS club Atlanta United at 16 so he is used to playing against much stronger opposition. He has scored 20 times for the USA under 17 and will give the hosts a difficult time in the opening game on October 6.

3. Paulinho, Brazil
While the headlines have focussed on the absence of Real Madrid starlet Vinicius Junior, there is plenty more the world-class talent in the Brazilian side. Paulinho has already played eight top flight games with Vasco da Gama and became the first player born in this millennium to score in the Brazilian championship.
4. Abel Ruiz, Spain
Spain have come to India with eight forwards in their squad of 21. Ruiz is a major part of that reasoning. Earlier this year year Ruiz became the highest scorer, ever, at the European championship. He has appeared, and scored, for Barcelona B in the second division and is already bing talked about as a future Spain No. 9.

5. Hadji Drame, Mali
A winger with great pace and skill. Drame helped Mali win the under 17 African Cup of Nations earlier this year, scoring three goals in the process. His father, Djibril, coaches the Mali senior national team so it would be safe to assume he is getting some decent career advice. A move to Europe hasn't worked out yet but might be on the cards if he sustains those earlier performances.
6. Mohammad Sharifi, Iran
The Iranian midfielder has tremendous experience, having already made pro debuts for Esteghlal in the Iranian league and Asian Champions league. He possesses a range of passing and vision that belies his age. Sharifi has completed a move to Saipa—a Tehran club managed by the legendary striker Ali Daei.
7. Callum Hudson-Odoi, England
Boasting names from the most popular clubs in India—Arsenal, Manchester City and United, Chelsea—the England squad has rapidly become a fan favourite ahead of India 2017. Hudson-Odoi has signed a three-year deal at Chelsea and has been scouted by the likes of Juventus. The forward, standing at just about six feet, has plenty of match experience with both Chelsea under 23 and England under 17.
😬 A post shared by Callum Hudson Odoi (@calteck10) on Oct 1, 2017 at 12:38pm PDT
8. Eric Ayiah, Ghana
The slightly-built Ghanainan striker will be looking to lead his team back to former glory. Two-time champions, Ghana are back in the tournament for the first time since 2007 and both the coach and the fans who we have met here in India seem to think a long run in on the cards. Much of that will depend on Ayiah's ability to get goals. If he does, perhaps, those links with clubs such as Porto might just be revived.
9. Jaminton Champaz, Colombia
Such is the confidence in Champaz that he scored into the top corner, from the edge of the box, on his professional debut for Desportes Tolima at the age of 16. Champaz is a pacy winger who operates mainly on the left and will be handful for Boris Singh when India play Colombia on Oct. 9.
10. Team India
The hosts are putting out their first team at a competition featuring the best players in the world. Without the kind of club and competition structures the rest of the world has built, India are well behind the curve. However, the squad has great pace and stamina. If they are able to get past the nervousness of competing and settle into the shape that coach Luis Norton de Matos has been drilling them in for the past several weeks now, we will get to see a well organised team with some individual talent. Given the nature of the event we think whoever plays for India will be worth watching.

There was absolutely no racial bias behind Jeffrey Zeigler firing his shotgun at a black teenager who reportedly came to his home to get directions to school  as evidenced by the quarter century he spent as a Detroit firefighter, according to defense attorney Rob Morad.
Rather, Zeigler and his wife were on high alert for possible break-ins, having had it happen to them multiple times at their Rochester Hills home, Morad said.
He has given his whole life to the business of saving lives, Morad said. He has no signs, no history of racism. If there were any racial issues, he wouldnt have spent his career working in the city of Detroit.
Zeigler, 53, is charged with assault with intent to murder and possession of a firearm in commission of a felony for reportedly shooting at Brennan Walker, 14, from his house on South Christian Hills Drive at around 8 a.m. on April 12. Brennan reportedly said he was walking to Rochester High School after missing his bus that day, and stopped at Zeiglers house to ask for directions. Brennan wasnt injured.

Zeiglers wife called 911 shortly afterward to report her husband had chased a black male who tried to break in.
According to the Oakland County Sheriffs Office, Zeigler fired one shot as Brennan walked away.
Morad said the Zeiglers have been victims of home invasions four times, including once by a neighborhood kid who lived in the neighborhood and was subsequently convicted.
Zeigler was released from jail after posting bond April 13 and placed on a tether. In court Tuesday, Rochester Hills 52-3 District Judge Julie Nicholson amended his bond conditions  which had prohibited him from being within 10 miles of Rochester Hills city limits or Brennan Walker  to allow him to attend court hearings and medical appointments, meet with his attorney and comply with mandatory random drug and alcohol testing.
Zeiglers next court date is May 22, where he will either move forward with a preliminary exam or waive that and proceed to circuit court for trial. Morad said that decision will be made after additional reports come in, as expected.
Morad declined comment on Zeiglers prior conviction for a misdemeanor gun charge.
Zeigler retired as a lieutenant from the Detroit Fire Department with work-related disability, Morad said.

Photo Highlights: President Obama Chicago Farewell Speech
President Barack Obama makes his final farewell speech in his hometown of Chicago. Arriving at O'hare airport on Airforce One Tuesday, early evening was First Lady Michelle Obama, daughter Malia and Vice President Joe Biden along with wife, Jill Biden. Making a final journey as the 44th President of the United States, expressways and local South Side streets were cleared as traffic stood at a complete when the 20-vehicle caravan made its way to Valois Restaurant in Hyde Park. There, President Obama conducted a one-on-one interview with NBC anchorman, Lester Holt before proceeding to give his farewell speech at McCormick Place. Nearly 20,000 attendees packed the nearly standing-room only space in the East wing of the McCormick Place as VIP attendees sat upfront to hang onto the President's every word. There were various groups that traveled from far and near to be a part of history including celebrity sightings from Sharon Stone to Empire's Jussie Smollett--local and state dignitaries. Opening up the ceremony was a special performance by Hip hop/R&B singer, BJ the Chicago Kid showcasing belting out the national anthem is a smart blue suit. Once President Obama hit the stage, the electric energy of emotions ran throughout the audience. At times, the crowd's applause was so loud that is impossible to hear him but there were moments that silence rippled throughout the venue--knowing this would be his last time addressing his hometown as Chief of Staff. In his signature style of class, poise and honor--he addressed the various strides that he and his administration has made over the last eight years in protecting America's democracy. His emotions got the best of him when he addressed his wife, First Lady Michelle Obama and daughter Malia who sat in the front row along with Vice President Joe Biden, wife Jill and his mother-in-law--Marian Shields Robinson. “Malia and Sasha, under the strangest of circumstances, you have become two amazing young women, smart and beautiful, but more importantly, kind and thoughtful and full of passion. You wore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily. Of all that I've done in my life, I'm most proud to be your dad.” After the speech, the Obama family took time out to walk along the barricades, greeting and shaking hands with supporters and friends. The scene was definitely historic and we knew it was the end of an era of class that will not be duplicated in the White House for a very long time. Follow Mary L. Datcher on Twitter
While Ayodele Oke, the Director-General of the Nigerian Intelligence Agency (NIA) has claimed that the $43 million, N23.2 million and £27,800 (N13billion) cash found in an apartment in Lagos last week belongs to his agency, information available to SaharaReporters suggests that the woman seen hauling the money into the apartment in Ghana-Must-Go bags may have been Folashade Oke, his wife.
Our investigation has revealed that the owners of Apartment 7B gave Folashade Oke, with phone number +2348059833410, as their contact. Sources at the NIA confirmed Folashade to be the spouse of their Director-General, Mr. Oke.
The day after the money was discovered, Mr. Oke had told SaharaReporters he could not verify any information about the money as he had not read any report linking his agency to the cash.
After pledging to speak to us thereafter, he did not take any calls until he suddenly announced that the money belonged to NIA, and that it had been approved by President Goodluck Jonathan for certain “covert” activities.
One of the whistleblowers responsible for the discovery told our correspondent that since he started working on the property as a guard, a woman who spoke fluent Yoruba repeatedly brought huge bags of money to Apartment 7B. That particular property was known to guards as Apartment “Dash-Dash” because in the records there were two dashes where the name of the owner ought to be.
He recalled that on two occasions, he helped the woman, who was always curiously dressed in a haggardly way, to carry the money to “Dash-Dash”. The woman, on the first occasion, gave him N10,000 as a gift, and on the second, N500.
He said the woman would spend about two hours in the apartment, then go freshen up in the gym at the back of the building before leaving.
While Mrs. Oke appears to be that person, who was quietly trying to traffic the money to the apartment for some reason, a quick check on True Caller shows phone number +2348059833410 to be customized as “Okemob Niger”.
According to the whistleblower, who is in hiding for fear of his life, there are about 19 fully occupied apartments and 2 penthouses at the 16 Osborne Road, Ikoyi, property. Estate valuers estimate each of the apartment with four bedrooms and state of the art facilities to cost about N250 million.
The building is owned by a former chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Ahmed Muazu, who is currently in Singapore, according to persons knowledgeable about his movement. Mr. Muazu, after initially denying ownership of the building, has now owned up.
The whistleblower said Mr. Muazu has many prominent Nigerians as apartment owners in the building. They include wealthy former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi, who owns one on the first floor; recently-retired Managing-Director of the NNPC, Esther Ogbue, on the second; and TV personality and owner of EbonyLife TV, Mo Abudu, on the 4th.
He further told our correspondent that Patricia, a daughter of former PDP “Mr. Fix-It” Chief Anthony Anenih, lives in Apartment 7A.
That is next door to 7B, which is now claimed by the NIA as belonging to it although only one woman, the wife of its Director-General, was ever seen in the premises in a home-decorating mission to furnish the apartment with up to N13 billion in raw cash.
Further investigations show that both Apartment 7A and 7B were initially owned by former Ms. Anenih and her husband Edo-Osagie, who used a company known as Bishop Hills Enterprises Ltd to buy them from the former PDP chairman. It is unclear at what point they parted with 7B.
SaharaReporters made efforts to contact Mrs. Edo-Osagie but a family source said she could not comment as her mother, Patricia Anenih, has just died. Mrs. Anenih, who had been sick for some time, died yesterday according to family sources.
Asked by SaharaReporters if there are CCTV cameras in the building, the whistleblower said there were none when he was a guard there. This is curious, considering the caliber of Nigerians who live in the building. However, a resident at the building said there are hidden CCTV cameras installed by Siemens but they are not known to the regular guards
The whistleblower also said there were no guards or security agents operating from within Apartment “Dash-Dash.” He maintained that apart from the woman who brought bags into the apartment, there were no occupants or operatives living or working there.
The whistleblower's account somehow tallies with the denial of the Central Bank of Nigeria earlier today that it ever sent bullion vans to take money to the apartment, as claimed by Mr. Oke.
Meanwhile, the EFCC operatives who raided the building have stated that in addition to the vast sums of money they found in various currencies, they also retrieved 2015 posters and presidential campaign paraphernalia belonging to former President Goodluck Jonathan and his then Vice President, Named Sambo at the scene.
An EFCC source also told SaharaReporters that the reason they went ahead and raided the apartment was because the EFCC has in the past year investigated several NIA operatives involved in corruption, finding widespread malfeasance within the agency, with several NIA operatives owning hotels, apartment buildings and luxury cars in Abuja and elsewhere.
That background may have emboldened the EFCC chairman to ignore pleas by Mr. Oke when he arrived suddenly at the EFCC offices asking them to call off the raid after they had already commenced.
The question now is: how did Mrs. Oke become involved in discreetly and personally ferrying money supposedly belonging to the federal government into a private apartment she appears to own, and apparently trying to hide it there?
Meanwhile, the whistleblowers have also said they are certain that at least two other apartments in the building, which is now being watched, may also contain large sums of money. But they did not confirm if they passed any details of this information to the EFCC.

The federal government is reportedly preparing to challenge up to five Labor MPs over their citizenship credentials.
Labor may be next to feel the heat over federal parliament's citizenship imbroglio, with the government said to be preparing to challenge up to five opposition MPs to prove they were properly elected.
The coalition appears willing to use its numbers to challenge Labor MPs Justine Keay, Susan Lamb, Brendan O'Connor, Maria Vamvakinou and Tony Zappia on the grounds they've not done enough to end doubts over their bona fides, News Corp Australia reports.
News of the move follows Monday's revelation by Deputy Prime Minister Baranaby Joyce, who told parliament he received advice last week from the NZ high commission that he could be a citizen of that country through his father, who emigrated to Australian in 1947.
The government has received legal advice from the solicitor-general which suggests Mr Joyce would not be found to be disqualified under section 44 of the Australian Constitution and would not have to resign as the Member for New England.
However, the High Court will now consider his future along with that of Nationals senator Matt Canavan, former Greens Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters, and One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts.
The outcome of Mr Joyce's case could deal a massive blow to the coalition's one-seat majority.
News Corp says the expectation the government will scrutinise the opposition MPs is a result of suspicions Labor encouraged its Labour allies in New Zealand to raise questions about Mr Joyce's citizenship.
Opposition Leader Bill Shorten on Monday declined an offer by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to "nominate any Labor members or senators whose circumstances may raise questions under section 44 of the constitution" so the parliament can also refer those matters to the High Court.
What a difference a refit makes!
Punch Taverns made a £322,000 investment in The Plough Inn last year and the result was quite spectacular. The village pub was fully re-decorated, with new flooring, lighting, toilets and improvements to the beer garden.
Southern-fried chicken fillets starter
We landed on a winter Saturday evening, by which time it was too dark and too cold to enjoy the latter, but inside, the evidence of the spruce-up was clear.
It was light, spacious and tastefully furnished with a mixture of functional, solid dining tables and chairs, comfy armchairs and poseur tables with bar stools.
A huge distressed-wood fireplace dominated the first part of the restaurant room, which also housed a large TV screen showing coverage from BT Sport and Sky.
There was a match on while we were there but it was not intrusive. In fact, from the spacious restaurant, we could barely even see the screen.
Wild mushroom soup
The atmosphere was cosy, friendly and comforting, with plenty of distance between the tables to make it intimate and conversations private. And gentle background music was enough to create a pleasant, warm ambience, while another big chill had arrived outside.
It was also spotlessly clean - in fact the latest Food Standards Agency inspection in June last year awarded The Plough a maximum five-star rating.
All good so far!
We ordered a drink at the bar – a pint of Doom Bar for me (it was either that or Black Sheep or Abbot Ale on the draught beer front) and Mrs L had her customary Merlot.
Chicken and ham hock pie
The first thing that struck us about the menu was the prices – as cheap as chips!
There were very few dishes above the tenner mark. Cheese and bacon barbecue burger, black and blue (Stilton) burger and chicken tikka platter, at £9.95, were among those main courses that came close.
The only meals to hit double figures were steaks, including 21-day-aged 8oz British rump steak at £10.95, The Big One burger, with two 6oz beef patties, fried free-range egg, bacon and beer-battered onion rings, at £12.95, and a mixed grill feast for £14.95.
There were nibbles, sharing boards, sandwiches, toasties, pies, burgers, grills and sides, as well as starters, mains and desserts, in quite an extensive selection, including a few vegetarian and gluten-free options.
Black cherry cheesecake
It was archetypal pub grub – and so we went for a classic choice and made our order at the bar.
I started with soup of the day, which was wild mushroom (v), at the bargain price of £3.45. Across the table, southern-fried chicken fillets, with allotment slaw and barbecue (or piri piri) dip, for £4.45, caught Mrs L's eye.
The soup, complete with a thick slice of light granary bread and foiled butter pats, was tasty, infused with a marked fungi flavour and suitably warming. But it was quite thin and lacked body.
The two breaded chicken strips opposite were also palatable, with succulent meat and a saucy coleslaw on a bed of rocket. It had been a pleasant start to the evening.
Our main courses soon followed and I was faced with an attractive-looking chicken and ham hock pie in a creamy leek sauce, with thick chips and peas (£8.95). The pie was spectacular – a dish rammed with mainly breast chicken chunks in the creamiest of sauces and topped with nicely-prepared shortcrust pastry.
It was a fair size and very filling, but was curiously accompanied by a small jug of rich, beef gravy. The chips looked spot on but their crispy exterior gave way to a floury centre, all the hallmarks of frozen fare, and the peas were overcooked and mushy - shame that neither matched the high quality of the pie.
Sponge pudding with raspberry jam
Opposite was delivered Aberdeen Angus lasagne, slow cooked in red wine and tomato sauce, served with warm, garlic sourdough bread (£7.95). Lasagne guru Mrs L enjoyed the dish, which was loaded with cheese and not too tangy. Her salad was a colourful combination of cubed peppers, red onion and cucumber on a handful of rocket leaves.
We took a 20-minute break to allow our substantial meals to settle before tackling desserts. Both my black cherry cheesecake (£4.45) and Mrs L's sponge pudding with raspberry jam (£3.95) were beautifully presented, light and a splendid way to conclude proceedings.
The accompanying vanilla ice-cream was exquisite, with tiny black flecks of vanilla running through it, proving its authenticity.
BARGAINS AND OFFERS AVAILABLE
Despite the very reasonable prices anyway, The Plough at Ellington does not rest on its laurels and makes some very competitive offers in a packed market.
A two-course midweek lunch, until 2.30pm, will only set you back £12 – and there's a 2 for 1 offer on desserts.
On Thursday, Friday and weekend evenings, there is a meal deal of two rump steaks and a bottle of wine for £25.
A kids menu, with main meals, including pork sausages, chicken nuggets, fish goujons and beef burger, at £3.95, and Sunday feasts of one course, £8; two courses, £10 and three courses, £12, are also tempting.

ON May 30 we celebrate the Goa Statehood Day.
Goa was liberated from the colonial rule in December 1961. After Liberation a major controversy arose as to whether it should remain a separate territory or should merge into a neighbouring state, Maharashtra or Mysore. In 1967, an Opinion Poll was held, the only such referendum in independent India. It decided that Goa, Daman and Diu should remain a separate entity with the status of a Union Territory. Thereafter all the three major political parties – United Goans, Congress, and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party – sought statehood for Goa.
Genesis of statehood
This demand was raised in March 1971 by A N Naik of the United Goans Party who moved a private members' resolution to this effect in the legislative assembly of Goa, Daman and Diu. It was approved unanimously. Sometime thereafter, Purushottam Kakodkar of the Congress introduced in the Lok Sabha a bill demanding statehood for Goa and in October 1976, R L Pankar of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party moved a private member's resolution in the legislative assembly also seeking statehood for Goa.
Replying to the debate, chief minister Sashikala Kakodkar stated “In the early years after Liberation the M G Party stood for merger with Maharashtra and fought for it through the Opinion Poll in a democratic way. The verdict of the Poll went against the merger and the M G Party accepted the people's verdict because it believes in the wisdom of the electorate. Goa, Daman and Diu are and should be what the people of this territory want to make of it.”
When I was elected to Parliament in 1977, the Union government was led by the Janata Party. Whilst prime minister Morarji Desai was opposed to small states, home minister Charan Singh supported them. Jayaprakash Narayan, the patron of the Janata Party also supported small states. In 1969, in an article in ‘The Hindustan Times', he called for “breaking up oversized states such as UP, Bihar, MP and a few others… The breaking up of large states, apart from resulting in a more compact, efficient and close to the people administration, should also go far to mitigate linguistic jingoism” he wrote.
My first speech in the Lok Sabha on April 4, 1977 and several of my subsequent speeches in Parliament dealt with the need to provide statehood to Goa. On May 30, 1987, Goa ceased to be a Union territory and became the 25th State of the Union of India.
Demand for special status
In April, 2013 the Goa legislative assembly demanded special status for Goa under Article 371 of the Constitution. The resolution was moved by chief minister Manohar Parrikar. Special status was sought for Goa on two grounds. As a result of large-scale purchase of land by persons from outside Goa, including foreigners, the average Goan cannot afford a house or land in Goa. Furthermore, there is large-scale migration into the state which may destroy Goa's identity.
The demand for special status was misconceived. The state government has the required powers to resolve the two issues. Land is a state subject vide entry 18 of the State List in the Constitution and the state can also legislate on land vide entry 6 of the Concurrent List. In addition, the 74th amendment to the Constitution provides that the function of “regulation of land use and construction of buildings” is one of the municipal functions. As a result of these legal provisions a state is competent to enact laws to restrict land transactions so as to protect the interests of the local people. This protection may involve restrictions on purchase of agricultural land by non-agriculturists as well as restrictions on purchase of land and property by outsiders. Such legal provisions exist in several states. Under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, no person can purchase land in Maharashtra if he is not an agriculturist. Similar provision also operates in Uttar Pradesh. Why is such a provision not enacted in Goa? The right to property is no longer a fundamental right and hence a law by the state government to protect the interests of the local population is unlikely to be declared null and void by any court.
Influx of migrants
Another reason for demand of special status was the large-scale influx of migrants into our state. Goa needs migrant labour. However, uncontrolled migration into the state can upset its demographic composition and lead to social and economic problems. There are several laws to control migration into the state but these laws are not being implemented effectively and remain largely on paper. The Interstate Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act of 1979, The Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act of 1970 and the Goa Daman and Diu Inter State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Rules 1982 are some such laws.
The 1979 Act provides for registration of all contractors who employed five or more interstate migrants on any day of the preceding 12 months. The contractors must furnish details of the workmen, issue a passbook with passport-size photograph to every workman indicating where he is working and other details. The state government is required to appoint inspectors to oversee implementation of the Act. The law directs builders and labour contractors to provide residential accommodation, sanitation and other facilities to the workers engaged by them. Yet, these provisions are ignored and much of the migrant labour lives in slums under the most unhygienic conditions which pose major health hazards to them as well as to the local people.
All migrant workers should be registered compulsorily in the panchayats and municipalities. Aadhaar cards as well as public distribution system cards should be issued to them to avoid having to buy foodgrains and kerosene at high prices. The state government should hold a yearly audit of all contractors who employ migrant workers and submit a report to the state legislature for its scrutiny. It should also open an Internet portal indicating the contractors and migrant workers in Goa for public information and verification. The machinery for implementation of the labour legislation needs to be strengthened
urgently.
Goa has achieved remarkable progress over the last five decades, particularly in core sectors such as education, healthcare and development of infrastructure, though there are obvious deficiencies in all these sectors. We must face the multifarious tasks that confront us today with courage and determination, with a rational outlook and commitment to a value system anchored on work ethics and the quest for excellence.
I hope Santa gives points for honesty. My daughter's Christmas letter reads, “I've been naughty and good.”
It's the first year we've written a letter to Santa. It turns out, it's the perfect exercise for a very chatty, slightly bossy, sometimes-naughty and sometimes-good three year old.
So perfect, that after mailing her letter, she wanted to write another, on behalf of the neighbour kids. I pointed out, reluctant to squelch her enthusiasm, that they would likely be writing their own.
“We could write letters for Papa and G-Lo!” she declared, her little face lighting up. (G-Lo is my mom — Grandma and Lois put together.) So we sat down again to tell Santa all about what her grandparents might like for Christmas. What opened up was a stream of consciousness — sometimes accurate, often not — and a huge new window into her brain.
“I am writing this letter for my Papa,” she dictated.
“He's been good this year. Really, super good.”
“What has Papa done that has been good?” I prompted.
“He makes supper for my G-Lo,” she said. He does not, not ever. I wrote it down anyway.
“What else?”
“He hasn't been hitting or pushing anyone,” came next.
Well of course he hasn't, I thought. But this was really illuminating for me as a mom. We don't hit in our house. It doesn't seem to be a problem at school. But does her definition of being “good” mean you haven't hit or pushed anyone? If I'm confused, imagine what Santa will think.
We move on. It turns out that for Christmas, Papa wants a toy doll that looks like G-Lo and some milk for the cows. (I obviously need to work on her animal husbandry knowledge too.)
For her part, G-Lo has also been good, and makes supper for Papa (this is true). She also doesn't push or do anything mean. She wants a horse to sleep with. And they would both like to hear back from Santa.
I'm like the kid at Christmas here, waiting to see how that turns out. And I'm listening a little more closely to her ideas around “good” and “bad,” knowing these are difficult concepts for kids to articulate.
What I love about my daughter's letters is that they allow a glimpse into her mind, at once innocent and mischievous. They showcase her earnest and honest heart. And let's face it, the best parts of Santa letters are the funny bits. When she said she wanted a chalkboard for Christmas, I had to think she was just looking around the room and naming objects within eyesight.
And Santa, if you're reading this, for the record, she's been more good than naughty.
We want to share your letters to Santa. Send a copy to SantaLetters@GlobalNews.ca. We'll share some of them on Global Edmonton.
Canadian Pacific Railway and the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference say they have reached a four-year tentative agreement to end a strike hours after it began.

The parties also reached a five-year deal for the Kootenay Valley Railway.
The union says full operations at both railways will resume Thursday morning across Canada.
Union president Doug Finnson called the deal a fair contract that its members can feel good about.
CP Rail chief executive Keith Creel says the agreements are positive for 12,000 railway employees, customers and the entire Canadian economy.

Creel adds that the agreement will provide long-term stability.
The tentative agreements must be ratified by Teamsters members over the coming months.
Details of the agreement are being withheld pending ratification.
SHOALS IDEA COMPETITION SHOWCASES AN INNOVATIVE COMMUNITY ON TUESDAY OCT. 10TH
FLORENCE- – The Shoals Idea Audition, an event sponsored by the University of North Alabama, Bank Independent, and the Shoals Chamber of Commerce, is scheduled for Tuesday, October 10 at 4:00 p.m. on the 2nd floor of the Guillot University Center on the University of North Alabama campus.
This annual event is free and open to the public. It is designed to foster new businesses, help entrepreneurs polish their presentations, and introduce community leaders who might be instrumental in helping make their ideas a reality. For the fourth year in a row, hopeful participants will have an opportunity to present their business ideas to a panel of area professionals, and the top scoring idea will be awarded a $5,000 cash prize, with $2,500 and $1,000 to second and third-place winners, respectively.
“Registered participants have an opportunity to review their presentations with experts when they attend training sessions in advance of the contest,” said Mary Marshall VanSant, a founder of the event. “On October 10 they will then have three minutes to make their pitch. The panel of judges will be made up of local entrepreneurs who will select finalists for the final round where they will pitch in front of a different panel of judges and a larger audience to determine the winners.”
Last year, Harriette Rost won the contest with her idea of a patient bed-turner device named TomiTurn. Rost envisioned a device that makes turning bed-ridden patients easier and that is designed to prevent injury to the patient and caregiver.
“I was blown away by my competition and surprised that I won,” said Rost. Winning the competition allowed her to the ability to attend trade shows to promote TomiTurn and purchase more raw materials for its production. “Participation in trade shows can cost up to $3,000 but they are an essential part of marketing products like mine,” Rost added.
Tasia Malakasis, owner and president of Belle Chevre, an award-winning cheese producer located in Elkmont, Alabama, and author of the cookbook Tasia's Table, will serve as this year's keynote speaker.

JALALABAD - Afghan special forces have killed nine civilians in an apparently botched operation in the eastern province of Nangarhar, officials said Tuesday.
The victims were related to Afghan Senate chairman Fazel Hadi Muslimyaar, provincial spokesman Attaullah Khogyani told AFP. “A delegation from Kabul has been sent to Nangarhar to investigate the incident,” he added.
The provincial health director confirmed the dead and wounded were brought to local hospitals in Jalalabad. Details of the attack late Monday in Chaparhar district remained unclear and there was no immediate comment from the defence ministry. The Senate is parliament's upper house.
Civilian casualties remain high in Afghanistan's grinding conflict with more than 10,000 killed or wounded in 2017, according to the UN. The majority of casualties were caused by the Taliban and other militants.
But pro-government forces, including international troops, were responsible for 20 percent of the civilian casualties last year - a seven percent increase from 2016. The increase was partly due to a growing number of aerial bombings by Afghan and foreign forces, the UN said.
The US is the only international force known to be carrying out air strikes in Afghanistan.
Earlier this month President Ashraf Ghani apologised after the UN released a blistering report into an Afghan Air Force strike in Kunduz on April 2 which killed 36 people including 30 children. The UN investigators could not confirm if the casualties in that incident were all civilian
HOUSTON -- J.J. Watt has heard your whispers.
He's seen the questions you've had about whether he can return to his All-Pro form after two back surgeries, whether he can play as hard as he did in his first five NFL seasons with the Houston Texans.
"I see them all," Watt said. "I know them all. I've heard them all. You hear doubters. You hear everything. I've heard everything from 'You get constantly injured' and things like that. This is the first games I've ever missed this last season. It's not like I've been hurt every single year. It's not like it's been some over and over and over again thing."
The three-time Defensive Player of the Year knows the danger of playing with the worry or the fear of getting injured again. He knows, he said on Monday at NRG Stadium, that if he doesn't play the way he has played in the past, he will not be as successful.
"If I'm out there trying to second-guess myself, if I'm out there wondering if I'm good enough, then I'm not going to be good anywhere, so there's no point in going out there and playing," Watt said. "All I can do is give it everything I have every single day, whether it's practice, meetings or film. I'm going to give it everything I have. I'm going to go out there, I'm going to have fun. I'm going to play the game I know how to play it, with energy, with enthusiasm, with excitement, rallying around teammates, having a lot of fun. Just enjoying football again.
"If something happens, it happens. But all I can do is play as smart and play as hard as I possibly can and try to be the best teammate I can be for these guys. And that's all I am going to do. Because that's the only way I know how to play."
Changes to how he prepares for the season started last year, when he was coming off January surgeries to his abdominal muscles and groin. And after two back surgeries in 2016, Watt had to continue to tweak those plans, knowing that continuing to work too hard could be harmful in the end. In February, Watt admitted that he came back too soon from his first back surgery, and that played a big factor in re-aggravating the injury in late September and needing a second back surgery two months after the initial procedure.
Watt said he plans to limit his reps throughout the upcoming season -- something he says he'll lean on the Texans' coaching and training staff to manage. By limiting his reps during practice or workouts, Watt hopes he can be smarter about how he uses his body.
Throughout last season, Texans coach Bill O'Brien and everyone who had contact with Watt said that although he absolutely missed football, he was slowly getting back to being himself physically, and that he would be back better than ever for the 2017 season. In February, Watt reiterated that himself, stressing that he was back to his normal offseason schedule and that he would be ready for the Texans' mid-April organizational team activities.
Now Watt feels like he's moving ever closer to being 100 percent, even though he acknowledged that since it's the offseason, and since he hasn't played in an NFL game since Sept. 22, he still has "plenty of time to improve and grow." And though there are changes and improvements Watt said he can make to ensure he's in the best position possible to stay healthy, he's not going to change everything about how he got to where he is: Perhaps one of the best defensive players in NFL history at age 28.
"I've learned a lot and I've really talked to so many people and kind of created a program and a plan where I can get the results I want without necessarily putting myself at risk in those situations," Watt said. "But what it comes down to, is you have to build confidence both in yourself, and your team obviously. And the only way you can do that is by putting in the work and putting in the time.
"You can never fake confidence. You can't bull--- yourself into thinking that you're good enough when you know for a fact that you didn't put in the work, that you didn't put in the time. So for me, that's where it all comes down to: making sure that I put in that time. Making sure that I put in that effort so that when I step on that field, I know for a fact that I can step out there confident and strong and I can go out and dominate because I put in the work. There's nothing to be worried about when you put in the work. The only time you have to be nervous or anxious for a game is when you didn't put in the work and you're hoping you're good enough. That's not a situation I would want to be in."
According to news reports, Nintendo has officially unveiled details to what is going to be the first line of DLC intended for a mainline Zelda entry to date with the upcoming Breath of the Wild installment. But it is not without a slight change to the common name.
According to HardcoreGamer, Nintendo's first ever "Expansion Pass," which will be available for purchase as soon as the game is going to be available next month at the US price of $19.99, will include access towards two upcoming DLC packs; the first of which is going to hit sometime this Summer, as well as several bonus items available at the start of the game.
The first batch of DLC will include the "Cave of Trials" challenge dungeon, with players taking on increasingly difficult levels of enemies the further they progress, along with a new hard mode and some additional map features. The second DLC, slated to drop around the last quarter of the year, will be featuring a brand-new dungeon altogether and an original story to be included in the game's main campaign.

Longtime Zelda fans might remember that the likes of trial dungeons could be played in entries like Wind Waker & Twilight Princess on the go without any charge, while an additional Hard Mode has been existing in various shapes - be it in the Master Quest or Skyward Sword that completely changed the flow and placement of entire dungeons, so confirmation about these extra modes not featured in the base game is going to be disappointing to the loyal Zelda fans.
According to Techi, while Nintendo has confirmed that such content is going to be available for both the Nintendo Switch and Wii U versions of the game, these two packs cannot be purchased separately and as a result, they are only accessible via purchasing the Expansion Pass. We'll have to wait for more updates on what will Nintendo do with this whole dilemma.

Last Saturday, an estimated 7,000 women, men, children and the occasional dog, gathered at Veteran's Park. As the sun beamed brightly overhead, they joined forces and under an eruption of confetti, they took part in the annual American Cancer Society Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk.
The American Cancer Society (ACS), has been hosting this walk for 23 years, with no intention of stopping. This year, which boasted the best weather the event has ever seen, attracted thousands of participants to not only join the walk but to learn more about cancer and support those affected by it.
“The number one goal is [that] they're leaving with a lot of hope,” said Laurie Bertrand, Executive Director of ACS.
While the overall objective is to provide a space filled with hope and healing, the walk also aims to achieve several goals. The main goals of the walk are as followed: to support cancer patients and survivors, honor those who have passed, educate more people and raise donations for breast cancer research.
Some of these goals were achieved during registration when attendees were invited to walk around the various tents which included the Kohl's Healthy Families tent, Survivor Tent and Reinhart tent among others.
At the Kohl's Healthy Families tent, people lined up to play a giant game of Operation. At the Dash Medical tent and Merchandise Tent, they could grab some pink gear like a pink camouflage backpack or the ACS's 2018 breast cancer awareness shirt.
Other goals, like funding, were raised through donations made by the teams and individual's walking in the event.
This year's monetary goal, according to the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer website, is $350,000, and so far they've reached $152,490.
While a majority of the money funds research, some of it goes to programs like the Road to Recovery, which offers free rides to those attending treatment.
Connie Morrow, whose parents both passed away from cancer, has been participating in the walk for the past three years.
“I feel good that I've given some support,” she said.
Morrow's parents passed away ten years apart. She's hoping that by helping the cause through events like these and donations, a cure can be found.
“I think everyone needs to participate in this,” Morrow said.
According to ACS, last year 252,710 were expected to be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Of that amount, 40,610 would die from the disease. In 2018, ACS data showed there have been 5,420 new cases of breast cancer in females this year and 720 deaths.
Between 1999 through 2014, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), marked the number of cases when a woman was diagnosed with breast cancer. The graph, which was based on increments of 100,000, calculated that in 2014, the total of both black women and white women each reached a little over 120, while Hispanic and Asian women each totaled at below 100.
Dorris Mattke was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago. She survived and has been participating in the walk ever since.
“They always have new information,” she said. “And walking along the lakefront is nice.”
While Mattke said her diagnosis came as a shock, she stressed the importance of exploring one's options. Chemotherapy isn't always a guarantee or an option she explained, as some people like herself had to work, but it's important to be informed and talk about it with one's doctor.
As the group prepared to walk, Bertrand imparted these words of strength, “Your courage, your hope and your passion are unmatched.” And with that, the women, men and children, proudly wearing their pinks, purples and the occasional neon blue, began their walk.
TULSA, Okla. (AP)  The Latest on a Tulsa teenager accused of fatally shooting a man in front of his children and raping an 81-year-old woman during a series of crimes committed on Sunday (all times local):
5 p.m.
A Tulsa teenager accused of fatally shooting a man and raping an 81-year-old woman has been formally charged as an adult in connection with the attacks.
Sixteen-year-old Deonte James Green was charged Friday with 17 counts connected to series of crimes on Sunday, including first-degree murder, rape, kidnapping and robbery. He remains jailed in Tulsa County.

The Tulsa World reported Green had previously been booked into the Tulsa Jail on Sept. 22 for several property crimes and released just three days before the attacks.
Police say Green broke into a couple's south Tulsa residence on Sunday, robbed them and sexually assaulted the woman.
After leaving the residence, police say he approached a woman and her two daughters with a gun and forced them inside his home, where he shot and killed her husband in front of the couple's children.

2:45 p.m.
A Tulsa teenager accused of fatally shooting a man and raping an 81-year-old woman had been released from jail just three days before the attacks.
The 16-year-old boy remained jailed Friday on complaints of first-degree murder, first-degree rape, robbery and other complaints in connection with Sunday's attacks.
The Tulsa World reported the teen had been booked into the Tulsa Jail on Sept. 22 for several property crimes.
Juvenile proceedings are typically closed to the public. The newspaper obtained a copy of the teen's earlier arrest report because it was filed for consideration as a youthful offender case, which allows the state to levy harsher penalties for serious offenses.
The Tulsa County District Attorney's Office declined youthful offender prosecution in the previous case in favor of sending it to the juvenile bureau.

LAHORE - Pakistan can store only 10 percent of its annual water flows, sufficient for use of 30 days only. The per capita water availability in the country has gone down to 908 cubic meters in 2017 from 5,260 cubic meters in 1951, rapid increase in population being the major contributing factor behind the phenomenon.
These views were expressed during a briefing about water sector to a delegation of National Security Workshop, National Defence University (NDU), who visited Wapda House to have briefings on the water and power sectors of Pakistan. The delegation headed by NDU Chief Instructor Rear Admiral Zain Zulfiqar, comprised of senators, members of the national assembly, members of the provincial assemblies, senior bureaucrats, technocrats, ambassador, senior military officers and representatives of civil society.
WAPDA Member (Power) Arshad Chaudhry, Member (Water) Syed Riaz Ali Shah, Secretary (WAPDA) Amer Ahmad and other senior officers of Wapda were also present on the occasion. WAPDA Adviser (Daimer Basha Dam) Dr Izharul Haq and Pepco General Manager (Revenue and Commercial Operation) Engineer Muhammad Saleem briefed the delegation about water and power sectors, respectively.
It was informed that about 29 million acre feet (MAF) of water escapes below Kotri Barrage every year on the average. The delegation was briefed that the country needs to construct more dams to enhance its water storage capacity to cope with the water requirements. As many as 20 million acres of additional land can be brought under irrigated agriculture if water is made available by constructing more dams.
The delegation was further briefed that Wapda is constructing six hydropower projects with cumulative generation capacity of about 4,800MW, of which, three projects with generation capacity of about 2,500MW will be completed from early 2018 to mid 2018 in a phased manner. These include Golen Gol, Neelum Jhelum and Tarbela 4th Extension hydropower projects. Another seven projects with gross water storage capacity of more than 10 MAF and power generation capacity of more than 16,000MW are ready for construction including Diamer Basha Dam, Mohmand Dam, Dasu Stage II, Tarbela 5th Extension and Bunji.
In another briefing on power sector, the delegation was informed about power sector reforms, existing power generation capabilities, generation mix, consumption patterns, line losses, receivables and circular debt. The delegation was also apprised of the government's efforts to improve the situation and overcome the electricity shortages in the country. The delegation was informed of the load forecast, generation additions and long term transmission expansion plan to evacuate electricity from the power houses to the distribution companies.
The latest report shows more than 24,000 Iowans registered to vote as Democrats last month.
The increase was likely fueled by the Iowa Democratic Party's statewide primary for governor and Democratic primaries in three of the four Iowa congressional districts.
The last time Democrats saw a voter registration increase of this magnitude in the month of June was back in 2006. Democrat Chet Culver won the party's competitive gubernatorial primary that year, en route to winning the governorship that November.
Republicans had just one statewide primary in June. for secretary of agriculture. Republicans gained about registered voters last month.
By the end of June, nearly two million Iowans were registered voters according to a report form the Iowa . The majority of Iowa voters — nearly 695,000 of them — are independents and are registered as “no party” voters. Republicans have a roughly 24,000 registration edge over Democrats statewide.
The two Iowa congressional districts that basically cover the eastern half of the state have a voter registration edge for Democrats, while the fourth district that covers northwest and north central Iowa has a significant Republican voter registration edge. The third district that covers the southwest quadrant of the state is basically a draw, with nearly an equal number of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Rod Blum of Dubuque is seeking reelection in the first congressional district. That's where Democrats hold a roughly 23,000 voter registration edge over Republicans. Abby Finkenauer of Dubuque is Blum's Democratic challenger. While incumbents are heavily favored to win congressional race, this contest is often listed as a toss-up by national rating agencies.
The Cook Political Report uses the phrase “leaning Republican” in its rating of the third district race between Republican Congressman David Young of Van Meter and Democrat Cindy Axne of West Des Moines.
Republican Congressman Steve King's district has about 70,000 more Republicans than Democrats. J.D. Scholten of Sioux City is the Democrat who's challenging King's bid for a ninth term in the U.S. House. Democrat Dave Loebsack of Iowa City is seeking a seventh term in congress. He faces a rematch with Republican Christopher Peters of Coralville in the second congressional district. It leans Democratic, with about 23,000 more Democrats than Republicans.
Independent voters are the largest block of voters in Iowa's first, second and third congressional districts. In the fourth district, Republicans even outnumber independents — by about 20,000.
There were about 11,000 registered Libertarian voters in Iowa at the end of June.
The race is on to help a critically ill baby beluga found stranded and alone in the waters off Alaska last week.
On Sept. 30, a tiny, two- to four-week-old male beluga calf, which is part of the incredibly rare and endangered Cook Inlet beluga population, was found stranded and alone on a beach in Trading Bay, about 80 kilometres from Anchorage.
Under authorization of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the animal was rushed to the Alaska Sealife Centre for Critical Care. There are only 328 of these animals left and the survival of this neonate or baby beluga is rare due to the care being incredibly difficult.
“[The mammal] is in very, very poor shape and has a very low chance of survival and needs a lot of work to help it survive,” said Vancouver Aquarium Veterinarian Dr. Martin Haulena.
Marine mammal experts and vets like Vancouver Aquarium's mammal curator Brian Sheehan and skilled personnel from Georgia Aquarium, Shedd Aquarium, Mystic Aquarium and Sea World have all flown in to try to help the dehydrated and emaciated baby beluga.
“The North American cetacean community is very close, so when the call goes out — the response is great,” Haulena said.
“Brian Sheehan has a tremendous amount of experience dealing with calves, in particular hand-raising calves, calves in trouble and also a lot of experience at our rehabilitation facility as well. So that's going to bring some [great] expertise up there.”

Sheehan said this would normally be a calf that would be getting help and be fed around the clock from his mother — but now it's a calf in trouble. Calves found in this type of condition typically have a 10 per cent chance of survival.
The experts will now have to deal with all the reasons why the calf was stranded along with a mammal that is now in metabolic crisis, which means it will need to be supported and cared for very carefully.
“It needs to be rehydrated and needs nutrition at a very specific rate and frequency… and that's just a lot of experience and a lot of time and a lot of effort — and it needs a lot of people to do that,” Sheehan said.
Their primary goal in the first few days and weeks of rehabilitation will be to stabilize the calf and get him gaining weight and re-hydrated.
“But while you're doing that, while you're buying yourself time, you want to know why the animal was stranded,” Sheehan said.
“You want to gain insight into that. you want to treat the things you can find and treat it… and that's what the team will be doing up there as well.”

Congolese soldiers kill Over 100 in militia clashes – U.N
Soldiers targeting the Kamwina Nsapu militia group in central Democratic Republic of Congo killed at least 101 people between Feb. 9 and Feb. 13, including 39 women, the U.N. said on Tuesday.
The soldiers fired indiscriminately with machine guns when they saw the militia fighters, who were armed mainly with machetes and spears, human rights spokeswoman Liz Throssell said, citing sources in the country.
“We are deeply concerned at the reported high number of deaths, which if confirmed would suggest excessive and disproportionate use of force by the soldiers,” she said.
Hundreds have died and tens of thousands have been uprooted in central Congo in recent months in battles between security forces and the militia, who are seeking to avenge the death of their leader Kamwina Nsapu.
He was killed by the Congolese armed forces last August, after vowing to rid Congo's Kasai-Central province of all state security forces, accusing them of abusing the local population.
“It appears that since then the militia have become radicalised and they are attacking state institutions, what they see as the symbols of the state. The actual roots of the conflict are very deep and very complex,” Throssell said.
The authority of some customary chiefs is recognised by the government and can be passed from father to son, but Kamwina Nsapu was not officially recognised.
Analysts say militia violence in Congo, a tinderbox of conflicts linked to land, ethnicity and mineral resources, has been exacerbated by President Joseph Kabila's failure to step down when his constitutional mandate expired in December.
Throssell did not have an estimate of the total size of the Kamwina Nsapu militia, but said there had been several attacks involving over 100 militia members.
“They have a lot of popular support,” she added.
Many of the militia fighters are children but Throssell could not confirm if children were among the dead. The majority of the dead were thought to be militia members, but 39 women were caught in the firing line and killed during an incident in a market on Feb. 9, she said.
The clashes took place in and around the town of Tshimbulu, about 160 km (100 miles) south of the provincial capital Kananga, she said.

The law of holes can be summarized as follows — if you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. It's easy to say, and more difficult to embrace. Especially in Montreal, where hubris has replaced insight and reverie has fogged up reality. While fans were taken to task for expressing their displeasure at the state of the Montreal Canadiens this year, sometimes pessimism is just good common sense. Despite protestations to the contrary, the Habs' defense is not better than last year. Reports of missed opportunities and poor player management aside, the questions that plagued the organization after Marc Bergevin traded P.K. Subban are no closer to being answered.
Can a team win by relying solely on the elite goaltending of Carey Price? Can a defensive team compete in an increasingly fast and offensively creative league? Will the team's best players score consistently enough to allow them to be competitive?
So far the answer to these questions is a resounding “non.”
Contending or Rebuilding
In the salary cap era, teams are either contending for the cup or retooling so they can. If you are unable to build a team to do the former, and unwilling to admit your errors and do the latter, you are destined for mediocrity.
Mediocre teams refuse to trade their best assets. They sign middling players to long-term contracts. They use their elite players in ways that don't suit their skill sets and then blame them when they don't succeed. Mediocre teams misuse their talent to ensure even when players want to be traded their value is so low, a reasonable return becomes difficult if not impossible.
Middling management assembles mediocre teams with significant holes in their lineup. When they struggle, management then insists the answer to their poor performance in is the room. Mediocre teams have no imagination.
Weekly reminder that Marc Bergevin believes the Habs are better this year, especially with their "improved defense."#MontrealCanadiens #FireBergevin — All About The Habs (@AATHabs) November 19, 2017
Learning to Live with Mediocrity in Montreal
Since Geoff Molson continues to publicly support Marc Bergevin and refuses to consider job applications from within the organization, Habs fans should start embracing mediocrity. There is no need to get angry. In fact, there are some aspects to all of this that fans could perhaps learn to love.
The Playoffs Have Come Early
In the short term, every game the Habs play for the next month or so is a playoff game. If they can string together enough wins, it is still technically possible for them to inch their way into the playoffs. This means the feverish intensity that comes with the postseason has come early to Montreal. Their failure will likely come after a heartbreaking January, likely in a series of games against the Boston Bruins. Their inevitable playoff loss will likely come just a few months earlier than usual. Until then, it is gonna be a wild ride. Strap in, Montreal. Say your prayers, eat your vitamins, and cross all your fingers and toes.
Cheaper Tickets and Fewer Fans
In the medium term, mediocre teams can't really charge fans top dollar. This is good news for people who want to see a middling hockey team for less than what the organization has been able to charge in the past. The Montreal Canadiens have reportedly sold out every home game since Jan. 8, 2004. However, this year, large blocks of seats at the Bell Centre sit empty and resellers offer tickets at less than face value. This is likely to continue.
Look at the bright side, Habs fans. Fewer fans mean shorter lines at the concession stand and at the bathroom. Embrace it, Montreal. You can see a game for less than in past years. The wait to buy a ten dollar mystery meat sandwich and fifteen dollar beer just got shorter. When Habs fans eventually adopt a new team, you can cheer for them from the stands when they come to town. Merci Marc.
The End of the Bergevin Era
Perhaps the best news is that mediocrity will breed resentment, eventually. And after firing the coach, sitting on eight million, and misusing and mismanaging Canadiens talent, every game the Habs lose is one day closer to the end of the Marc Bergevin era. Of course, there is a bittersweet realization here for Habs fans. Every game the Canadiens win is another day with Bergevin at the helm. As we wait for this frustrating season to end, fans should try not care too much that Montreal is just not as good of a sports city as Toronto.
Toronto: the city, infrastructures, the economy, head offices, the jobs…& their sports teams & fans…everything Montreal could've been… — Tony Marinaro (@TonyMarinaro) December 9, 2017
In short, Montrealers should learn to live with mediocrity. It is time to start using the past tense – as in “the Habs used to be a great franchise.” Fans should enjoy those cheaper tickets and shorter bathroom lines. They should try to remember that every game the Habs lose is the first step toward them winning again.
Provided, of course, that Molson remembers the first law of holes.

A now-deleted Facebook page, which referenced the misogynist Incel subculture, belonged to accused killer Alek Minassian, the platform has confirmed.
Facebook says it deleted the account in the aftermath of Monday's van attack in Toronto.
Minassian had been active on the page as early as March 10, when he uploaded a profile picture.
Minassian made a court appearance Tuesday morning, where he was charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder in connection with a vehicle rampage on Toronto's Yonge Street Monday afternoon.
The page's only post appears to have been published just before the attack, at 1:27 p.m. (In the archived copy, the timestamp appears in GMT, the time in London.
Here's how we interpret this:
The first part involves details borrowed from the real military. Minassian was briefly in the armed forces in the fall of 2017 but asked to leave after 16 days of recruit training, Global News has confirmed. (The military's main recruiting centre for southern Ontario is roughly at the centre of the area of the vehicle attack.)
Private (Recruit) Minassian
Private (Recruit) is a rank given to untrained junior soldiers, which distinguishes them from trained privates.
Infantry 00010
00010 is the military's occupation code for non-officer infantrymen.
Anne Marie D'Amico has been identified as the first victim of Monday's deadly van attack in north Toronto. Ten people were killed in the attack. Caryn Lieberman has more.
wishing to speak to Sgt 4chan please
4chan is a discussion board which has been linked to a variety of hoaxes and the alt-right meme Pepe the Frog.

The Incel Rebellion has already begun!
Incels (it stands for “involuntarily celibate”) are a mysogynist online culture of men who don't have access to sex and believe they are entitled to it. A Reddit group catering to them had 40,000 users before it was banned in 2017 under a policy that forbids inciting violence against identifiable groups.
“Almost all agree that the world (women) owes them sex and that they are oppressed for being sexless men,” wrote U.S. academic Ross Haenfler. “Ideally, incels would be able to have access to women's bodies whenever without any backlash — or input from women.”
“Obviously the hatred of women and the expectations incels have for them are contradictory, so involuntary celibacy perpetuates itself.”

We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys!
In the incel subculture, Chads and Stacys are (respectively) men and women who are sexually active.
All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!
Elliot Rodger killed six people near the University of California, Santa Barbara campus in 2014 before killing himself. In a video shot before his death, Rodger complained about still being a virgin at 22, and described himself as a “supreme gentleman.”
However, some things remain unclear about Minassian's account:
Somebody liked Minassian's post on Monday — it's not clear who.
Also, somebody saved a copy of the account into archives.is on Monday just before 4 p.m., over an hour before the earliest announcement of Minassian's name. How did they know to do that?
WATCH: Alek Minassian, the 25-year old man suspected of killing at least 10 people and injuring 15 others has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder, after a rental van he was driving struck pedestrians on Yonge Street in north Toronto. Catherine Mcdonald reports.
In May 2013, months after friends and family had gathered to remember Wayne Millard, his son was arrested for the murder of Tim Bosma, of Hamilton, who disappeared after leaving his house with two men who asked to test drive a truck he posted for sale online.
Soon after Dellen Millard's arrest, police reopened the case of his father's death. They still had the gun that was found beside his bed, court has heard. They tested the gun and found Dellen Millard's DNA on the handle, court documents show. Last year, a gun trafficker pleaded guilty to selling Dellen Millard the revolver.
In 2016, Dellen Millard and his friend, Mark Smich, were found guilty of first-degree murder in Bosma's death and received life sentences. The jury heard that the pair killed Bosma and burned his body in an animal incinerator.
Millard and Smich were also later convicted — and sentenced to life — in the murder of Laura Babcock, a young Toronto woman who vanished in the summer of 2012 and whose case was also reopened by police following Millard's arrest in Bosma's disappearance.
Millard's third murder trial will be in front of a judge alone. Ontario's attorney general agreed the man's notoriety would make it difficult to find fair jurors, thus granting the rare request to hold a first-degree murder trial without a jury.
Millard's defence, according to court documents, will be that his father killed himself. A portion of the trial is expected to focus on Wayne Millard's state of mind at the time of his death.
The elder Millard loved aviation and animals.
In 1982, just days after he was arrested for filming baby seals being clubbed to death, he flew a small crew back into the area to get onto the ice near the beaches of P.E.I.
Wayne Millard had the means — a plane, a helicopter and financing — for the venture. He and Burns, who would later become his wife, were making a film about the seal hunt with the help of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society founder Paul Watson.
"He was very incensed about the seal hunt," Watson said. "He stuck to his ground and didn't give in. He was persistent, passionate and he was dedicated."
Wayne Millard was a longtime Air Canada pilot before getting involved with Millardair. He once sued Air Canada because they suspended him for growing his hair too long, said Dennis Chadala, who wrote a book about his years with Millardair.
"Wayne was a kind man who trained me on many different kinds of planes and we had a kinship in that we were banded together in order to handle his father, Carl, who was a real tough boss," Chadala said. "But he was also a rabble-rouser."
After his father died in 2006, Wayne Millard took over Millardair, but the company wasn't doing well. He embarked on a project to transform Millardair into a maintenance, repair and overhaul operation, and secured a massive hangar at the Region of Waterloo International Airport. He told others, including his cousin Roberts, that he was doing it so his son could run it one day.
Shortly after Wayne Millard was found dead, his son fired everyone at Millardair and wound the business down.
In an obituary published in the Toronto Star in 2012, Dellen Millard called his dad a generous man.
"His hope was for a time when co-operation would be the norm and competition was only friendly," he wrote. "He was patient and stubborn ... He believed animal welfare was a humanitarian effort. He was a good man in a careless world. He was my father."
Moscow is grappling with a slew of fake bomb calls that have prompted the evacuation of shopping malls, schools, railway stations and administrative buildings. (Photo: Pavel Golovkin / AP file)
Moscow — Moscow on Friday faced over 130 fake bomb calls that prompted the evacuation of some 100,000 people from shopping malls, schools, railway stations and office buildings.
It was the most massive flurry of fake bomb threats since a wave of bomb hoaxes began in early September. The fake bomb threats have affected dozens of Russian cities and incurred massive economic damages.
Among those targeted by the bomb calls Friday were all four Moscow airports, five railway stations, 15 shopping malls, several hotels, more than 20 schools and many other venues, the state Tass news agency said. No explosives have been found in the anonymous calls.
Flights to and from Moscow weren't affected, as security agents at the airports checked for explosives without holding evacuations.
The bomb calls continued until the evening, when the Luzhniki sports arena and office buildings in the Moscow City district were evacuated — including the Moscow city hall legislature and the government's analytical center.
Alexander Bortnikov, the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the main KGB successor, said Thursday the agency had tracked down four people suspected of engineering the wave of hoaxes.
Bortnikov said the suspects were Russians living abroad who had accomplices inside the country, but he wouldn't identify them or describe their motives. He added that the perpetrators were using internet connections to make the calls, making them hard to identify.
Russian media have speculated that the fake calls might have been launched from neighboring Ukraine — which has been angered by Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and it supports for pro-Russia separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine — or staged by other Kremlin foes. There has been no evidence to back any of the theories, however.

Lady Gaga has enjoyed her fair share of applause over the years, but Stefani Germanotta may be on the edge of acting glory too, if this first picture from A Star Is Born is anything to go by. Helmed by Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper, the upcoming musical will star American Horror Story's Lady Gaga in her first headline movie role, stripped of her usual artpop trappings, and taking on a more honest and vulnerable part.
A Star Is Born [Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures]
No longer beautiful, dirty, rich, this new reimagining of the classic story will see Germanotta dancin' in circles around Hollywood as #BradleyCooper's alcoholic star fights to help Gaga succeed, even while his own career fails.
Originally made in 1937, #AStarIsBorn has since been remade twice, once with Judy Garland in 1954 and again in 1976, this time starring Barbra Streisand. Does Lady Gaga have what it takes to go cheek-to-cheek with the star quality of these iconic performers?
Remember when Lady Gaga was inspired by old-school Hollywood glamor in 'American Horror Story: Hotel'?
We may have exaggerated slightly when we suggested that there's a million reasons why the latest remake will succeed. However, we remain confident that A Star Is Born will be the surprise musical hit of 2017, despite the fact that this will be Bradley Cooper's first directorial project.
Warner Bros. Pictures have also released an official synopsis for A Star Is Born, which teases a complicated dynamic between Gaga and Cooper's characters:
"Cooper plays Jackson Maine, a country music star who is on the brink of decline when he discovers a talented unknown named Ally (Germanotta). As the two begin a passionate love affair, Jack coaxes Ally into the spotlight, catapulting her to stardom. But as Ally's career quickly eclipses his own, Jack finds it increasingly hard to handle his fading glory."
American Horror Story [Credit: FX]
At one point, Clint Eastwood was set to direct Lady Gaga's 'Telephone' co-star, Beyonce Knowles, in the lead role. However, the country influence in Germanotta's latest album Joanne suggests that the Oscar-winning songwriter is better suited for the remake.

The fact that Stefani Germanotta has chosen to be credited with her real name for A Star Is Born implies that #LadyGaga is determined to be taken more seriously in the acting world, transcending her previous genre roles from the likes of #AmericanHorrorStory, Muppets Most Wanted, and Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.
Will Lady Gaga leave us starstruck in A Star Is Born, or will it flop and leave us speechless? It's impossible to know for sure until Bradley Cooper's directorial debut hits cinemas on September 28, 2018, but if Germanotta pulls this off, I'll be so happy I could die.

Nick Cannon is done with America's Got Talent. The comedian announced on his Facebook page Monday, saying he was “deeply saddened” about being “threatened with termination by executives” after he made a racial joke about NBC on his recent Showtime stand-up special. Production for season 12 of America's Got Talent, which would've been Cannon's eighth season as host, is set to begin next month.
So, who will replace him? Maybe Ryan Seacrest? It's no surprise that Simon Cowell not only created the show but is also a judge and they have quite a bit of history together. Check out his reaction to the news below…

A Harare Central Prison convict on the verge of finishing serving a 10-year jail term for rape, was on Friday slapped with two more years for sodomising a fellow inmate.
Farai Makwiyana (48) appeared before Harare magistrate Ms Victoria Mashamba facing charges of aggravated indecent assault.
He sodomised his cellmate. Makwiyana was only left with two and half years from the 10-year sentence he had been serving on his previous conviction of rape.
In passing sentence, Ms Mashamba said the court was lenient in sentencing him since it had been proved that he did not penetrate the complainant, but only ejaculated on his buttocks.
She further indicated that Makwiyana managed to go through the five years he was given on his previous conviction without committing the same offence, therefore he was given a shorter term.
The prosecutor Ms Idah Maromo proved that on July 1 this year around 3am at Harare Central Prison, Makwiyana and the complainant were sleeping in the same cell and bed while naked.
The complainant felt cold, woke up and saw Makwiyana covering his head with a blanket. He touched his buttocks and discovered that he had semen. At that moment, Makwiyana started apologising for soiling his buttocks.
Makwiyana then wiped the semen and told the complainant not to disclose the matter to anyone. The complainant told the other inmates, despite Makwiyana's plea.
In defence, Makwiyana denied the allegations saying that he did not commit the offence, because the complainant was sleeping on his back.
He told the court that he woke up early that day to smoke and that's when he heard the complainant waking up the other inmates telling them that he had been sodomised.
Makwiyana further indicated that he only apologised and also wiped the semen, because he had been thoroughly beaten by the other convicts who were in that cell.

Michigan fans know what they're missing. They can't help but know, really, because everyone else around them has one or two or more of what they don't have, whether you're talking about Big Ten championship trophies or NFL-caliber quarterbacks over the last decade.
Jim Harbaugh knew what he was missing, too. He saw what everyone else saw — and then some — this past season, as the Wolverines repeatedly came up short in big games. At times, it felt like they were playing with one arm tied behind their back offensively. And while not all of that gets pinned on the quarterback play — the offensive line and receiving corps both were major issues — much of it certainly can be.
That's why Monday's announcement Mississippi quarterback Shea Patterson is transferring to Michigan was an important one, if not a surprising one. The weekend campus visit by Patterson felt more like a house-hunting trip than a recruiting stop. And he might soon be joined by a couple of his Ole Miss teammates, safety Deontay Anderson and receiver Van Jefferson, that are contemplating a similar move, with the Rebels program facing NCAA probation.
Whether or not Patterson will be eligible to play in the fall is still up in the air, though it seems like a safe bet he'll get his clearance eventually. And once he does, then the real competition will begin, because that No. 1 quarterback job will be up for grabs as well, with redshirt freshman Brandon Peters bracing for a fight and true freshman Dylan McCaffrey eager for a chance to prove himself in Harbaugh's mandated “meritocracy.”
Filling a need
That's the real payoff here for Harbaugh and his staff, who just landed one of the better young passing talents from the SEC — a player that some recruiting analysts had pegged as the nation's top quarterback in the class of 2016 — to a roster that seems well-stocked at just about every other position. And to a program that's had too many question marks at the most important position for far too long.
Injuries and ineffective play forced Harbaugh to use three different starting quarterbacks this season: First Wilton Speight, then John O'Korn and finally Peters, who'll get another start for the Wolverines in the Outback Bowl on Jan. 1. But none of them was able to lift Michigan past their rivals in a competitive Big Ten East division.
Michigan ranked 110th in pass efficiency, 111th in passing yards, and only seven FBS teams threw fewer touchdown passes this season. More telling, O'Korn and Peters combined to go 60-of-121 for 735 yards and one touchdown with four interceptions in Michigan's four losses. Most of that was O'Korn's work, of course. All but the three quarters of the Wisconsin game that Peters played, in fact.
Yet coupled with Speight's decision to transfer, that's all the more reason why Harbaugh needed to bring in another transfer quarterback — his third in four years. At the very least, he needs the experienced depth — Peters' 64 snaps were the only regular-season action any of the returnees could claim — and the competition.
No guarantees
In Patterson, who has two years of eligibility remaining, he gets that and potentially much more, with some intriguing playmaking talent and moxie. (That scrambling ability might come in handy, too, if Michigan's offensive line next fall looks anything like it did for much of this season.) Harbaugh and offensive staff also get a former five-star recruit to go along with four-star talents in Peters, who'll be a redshirt sophomore next fall, and McCaffrey, who sat out as a true freshman this season. Another four-star recruit, Joe Milton, is expected to join the group in the fall, along with Kevin Doyle, a three-star prospect out of Washington, D.C.
Stars don't guarantee anything, obviously. Transfers don't, either, as we saw with O'Korn. But the lack of a guiding star at the quarterback position goes a long way in explaining Michigan's aimless wandering over the last decade. Outside of the Denard Robinson era, it was Steven Threet and Tate Forcier and Devin Gardner, until Harbaugh arrived and immediately brought in a graduate transfer from Iowa in Jake Rudock who played his way into an NFL job in Detroit.
By contrast, Michigan State has had a future NFL quarterback starting every season but one since 2007, going from Brian Hoyer to Kirk Cousins to Connor Cook. Now they've got Brian Lewerke, who looks like he might be one, too. Ohio State has enjoyed a similar run, going from Terrelle Pryor to Braxton Miller to J.T. Barrett, with a Cardale Jones cameo thrown in for good measure.
Those teams had plenty else going for them, including some dominant defenses the years they won league titles. But Michigan has had defenses like that lately and hasn't gotten over the hump — 2-8 against the Spartans and 1-9 against the Buckeyes in that 10-year span.
What's missing? Michigan fans know, and Harbaugh does, too. How could they not? Their rivals keep giving them annual reminders.

Whether you know Capaldi from Torchwood, Getting On, the most excellent comedy The Thick of It, The Musketeers, or his recent spin as the Twelfth Doctor on Doctor Who, this hour of highlights may just introduce you to the many and varied roles from his filmography.
The panel also serves as a special teaser for this holiday season's Christmas special, “Twice Upon a Time”, which will be Capaldi's last appearance as the Doctor before Jodie Whittaker takes on the role. Here's where and when you can see the panel:
October 06, 2017, 10:30 AM – 11:30 AM – The Theater at Madison Square Garden
Gorakhpur: Pushpa Sales Pvt Ltd, the company which is feeling the heat over disruption in liquid oxygen supply at BRD hospital has announced that there was no disruption in the supply despite outstanding dues of Rs 69 lakh.
Speaking for the first time over the incident which claimed 30 lives on August 10 and 11, the company said the college was heavily reliant on liquid oxygen supply which was a contract violation.
Company also disclosed that one consignment generally lasts for a period of six days and the hospital sends a requisition two-three days in advance.
According to an internal note regarding oxygen demand, a minimum of 350-400 jumbo oxygen cylinders should be there at every moment as there is liquid oxygen shortage.
But hospital administration has admitted that there were just 57 cylinders in hospital's stock on August 10 night.
Top 60 looms
Patton Kizzire already has two PGA Tour victories this season and is No. 2 in the FedEx Cup. That still might not be enough to avoid qualifying for the U.S. Open.
The USGA in 2012 eliminated its exemption for multiple winners on the PGA Tour from the previous U.S. Open when it revamped its criteria that focused more on the top 60 in the world ranking. Kizzire is at No. 57 this week.
The cutoff for being among the top 60 is on May 21, after the AT&T Byron Nelson. There also is another cutoff for the top 60 on June 11, the final ranking going into the U.S. Open on June 14-17 at Shinnecock Hills.
Chief among the prominent names not yet eligible is Adam Scott, who has played in 67 consecutive majors dating to the 2001 British Open at Royal Lytham & St. Annes. Scott, who missed the cut last week in the Texas Open, is at No. 64.
Alexander Levy of France moved up 19 spots to No. 47 with his victory last week on the European Tour, and that might be enough to secure his spot.
Among those near the top 60 with three tournaments remaining — the Zurich Classic in New Orleans does not offer world ranking points as a team event — are Luke List and Thomas Pieters (tied at No. 54), Bernd Wiesberger (No. 60), Ryan Moore (No. 62), Charles Howell III (No. 63) and former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel (No. 65). Schwartzel has played in every major dating to the 2009 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black.
The winner of The Players Championship in three weeks gets a three-year exemption.
Niemann's debut
Joaquin Niemann already has shown a knack for the big occasion this year.
The 19-year-old from Chile thought he was playing his final round as an amateur in January until he shot a 63 in the last round to win the Latin American Amateur Championship, which got him into the Masters.
He delayed turning pro to play at Augusta National. And in his pro debut, Niemann shot 67-67 on the weekend to finish sixth in the Texas Open. The top-10 finish will get him into the Wells Fargo Championship next week at Quail Hollow, along with giving him a big start toward earning special temporary membership on the PGA Tour and having access to unlimited sponsor exemptions.
He has 100 FedEx Cup points and needs 365 to earn special temporary membership. Niemann says he already has received exemptions for the AT&T Byron Nelson and the Memorial.
"I think this is going to give me a lot of confidence to try to do my card for this year," Niemann said. "Thing is, I've got a couple more tournaments coming and I just can't wait for it."
Niemann also is exempt into the final stage of U.S. Open qualifying. He gave that up from his Latin American Amateur victory by turning pro, but the U.S. Open exempts Mark H. McCormack Medal winners (No. 1 in the world amateur ranking) into sectional qualifying if they no longer are amateur.
Scott's scheduling
Adam Scott tends to play less rather than more, though he's not opposed to making it up as he goes along depending on the mood and the game. That's one reason he chose to play the Texas Open coming off a 70-71 weekend at the Masters.
It didn't work out as Scott played in the windy side of the draw in San Antonio, didn't play particularly well and missed the cut.
But it reminded him of an occasion 10 years ago, when he tied for 25th at the Masters with a reasonable performance. He flew home to Australia and played golf with some of his friends. And he was playing well.
"And I'm like, 'Why am I wasting my good golf on you guys?'" Scott said. "So I flew back the next week to Dallas and won the Byron Nelson. Kind of one of those things where you can't be so stubborn. I'm trying to be really in tune with where my game's at and identify why I'm just not having better results. To change that, I've got to change something. Otherwise, I'm just going to do the same thing."

Final word
"I feel like a veteran right now. I feel like a tour player now. I know I can beat these guys and just going to wait for my week and try to win." — Joaquin Niemann after finishing sixth in his professional debut at the Texas Open.

MESA, Ariz. (AP)  A key to the Oakland Athletics' young and relatively inexperienced starting rotation will be to consistently get the ball to the bullpen with a lead or a tie.
If that happens, a number of late-inning specialists figure to be able to close out games on a regular basis.
"It'll be fun but it will also be something that is going to have some people step up, including myself," No. 1 starter Sonny Gray said on reporting day for Oakland's pitchers and catchers. "If we can go out there with that light-hearted, young, having fun mentality. The good thing about having a bunch of young guys is we can make it as much fun as we want."
The's aren't highly thought of as contenders this season after a second straight last-place finish in the AL West. For that to change, Oakland will need to get better results out of a projected starting rotation whose ace, Gray, had a down year in 2016, going 5-11 with a 5.69 ERA. He was an All-Star in 2015 and had 28 wins combined in 2014 and 2015. Other potential starters include Kendall Graveman, Sean Manaea, Jharel Cotton, Andrew Triggs and Jesse Hahn.

"Expectations aren't really high for any of these guys," Gray said. "For any of us, really. We can just go out there and do our thing and hopefully by the end of it, put together something pretty cool."
Catcher Stephen Vogt said it's frustrating that people don't give the A's more credit.
"We know how good we can be if we're healthy and our guys pitch the way they're capable of," Vogt said. "I think this lineup is going to put up a lot of runs. You try not to pay attention to everybody kind of counting you out, but at the same time, when no one's even talking about you that's when you can really sneak up on some people and ruin some other teams' seasons."
Graveman's 10 wins and 186 innings led the staff in 2016.
"I set some goals last year and I met them," Graveman said. "I think I'm going to set some higher goals this year. For me that's huge, to write them down in spring training. Make every start, I think that's huge."
Manaea made 24 starts last season and after some early struggles, finished with a 3.86 ERA. Cotton came to the A's in a trade with the Dodgers involving Rich Hill and Josh Reddick last season. Triggs went 1-1 in six starts and debuted last season.
"There are a lot of young guys with not very much experience, but a lot of them got their feet wet last year," Vogt said. "They had a full offseason to prepare for what's in front of them."
Gray could get the chance to face top competition in games that matter next month in the World Baseball Classic. He would join Team USA in the second round in San Diego.
"It lines up just really well," Gray said. "The fact that you get to potentially put on the jersey again is a cool feeling. Something I've done in the past and I've really enjoyed."
Gray's bullpen session schedule will be altered slightly for the WBC, he said, but it's "nothing too crazy."
NOTES: Newly acquired reliever Santiago Casilla has yet to report springing training and may miss his scheduled physical on Wednesday due to issues with his international visa. ... A smiling Andrew Lambo, back with the A's as a non-roster camp invitee, said he's ready to play again after beating testicular cancer last year. He's been cancer-free for seven months. ... C Josh Phegley is running and ready to participate fully in workouts, he said, after being limited last season by left knee surgery and setbacks. But manager Bob Melvin said he might ease Phegley into early spring drills. ... Ps Chris Bassitt and Felix Doubront are throwing after recovering from last year's elbow surgeries. "They'll definitely be in the mix later on this season," Melvin said.
One thing that Nigeria as a country has struggled with for decades is her international image.
With due regard to the many factors that may be affecting our reputation-which needs to be addressed, tourism seems to be the ultimate solution to improve it. Hence, concerted efforts should be invested in by the government to boost and manage our international reputation.
The impact of a not very good image
The media is an agenda setter. It gives us the subjects and things to discuss and talk about. If the content of the media is negative, it rubs off on Nigeria's international image. The impact is quick and spontaneous because very few people will brave the storm to visit Nigeria for whatever purpose due to our not very good image.
Definitely, it is not the fault of the media. It is what is happening in the country that they are reporting. Hence, every Nigerian from the top to the bottom must be involved in the reputation building of the country by what we say and do.
Flipping the coin
Almost all the country of the world have a reputation problem. It is noteworthy to say that a not too lofty reputation is not exclusive to Nigeria or Africa. However, these countries whose reputation is ‘fantastic' have found a way to tiptoe these negative image and reverse the situation.
You see Nigerians rushing to Dubai. The fact is, Dubai is not better than Nigeria. Nigeria has lush green vegetation, mind-blowing landscapes and awesome tourist destinations but we do not sell ourselves. Dubai is in our faces so much that every Nigerian wants to go to Dubai.
We watch international stations like CNN, BBC and Aljazeera and we watch countries tapping tourism to sell themselves. They show their pristine destinations and what they have to offer tourism-wise to visitors and of course, these encourage people to visit. They also invested heavily in their tourist attractions.
If we can do same, leisure and business travellers will be attracted to the country and a business like Jumia Travel will be able to make money off them through booking of their flights, packages and hotels. At the same time, if we are hospitable, showcase our culture and take them to check out our destinations, they will return home with their minds reformed. They will pass the message to others that Nigeria is not what either the local or international media portrays it to be.
We have so much to do
Although tourism is a viable tool to invigorate or amplify our image, there are so many other things that we need to work on if we want tourism to transform it. From changing what Nigerians think and say about the country to the actions of government officials across the board and revamping tourism destination, they all combine for tourism to boost our international image.

MANILA - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has said his nation could go to war if its soldiers were hurt in the disputed South China Sea, a top aide said Wednesday after allegations emerged that Beijing had harassed Manila's troops in the area.
National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon made the comments as Duterte's administration pushed back against criticism its response to Chinese activities in the hotly contested waters had been weak.
"Just the other night, the president said if my troops are hurt there, that could be my red line," Esperon told reporters.
"Or, if our people are hurt there at Pag-asa Island. We are not saying we are going to war, but if they oppress us that may force our hand, because we will not allow ourselves to be oppressed."
Pag-asa, better known as Thitu, is the largest of the islands and outcrops garrisoned by Philippine troops in the disputed areas of the South China Sea.
Opposition lawmaker Gary Alejano alleged at a Wednesday congressional hearing that a Chinese navy helicopter had harassed Philippine troops on Second Thomas Shoal, also held by Manila, earlier this month.
The Philippine Navy launched a rubber boat to resupply its Second Thomas Shoal base when "a chopper... hovered in a close and dangerous distance," Alejano said, adding the helicopter's proximity had blown seawater into the Philippine vessel. Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano told the hearing the Philippines had protested the incident and resolved the matter "quietly", but refused to disclose details.
China claims most of the resources-rich sea through which $5 trillion in shipping trade passes annually, and in recent years has reclaimed reefs and shoals including some claimed by Manila. Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims in the sea. China this month deployed anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles on the disputed Spratly Islands off the Philippine coast and flew nuclear-capable bombers to a base in another disputed part of the sea.
Duterte has pointedly said elsewhere he would not go to war against Beijing and hailed improving relations that led to more Chinese trade and investment.
US to keep confronting Beijing in S Sea: Mattis
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis vowed Tuesday that the US would keep confronting China over its territorial claims in the South China Sea, where Beijing has established a significant military presence on contested islands.
Mattis's remarks came after Beijing voiced "strong dissatisfaction" Sunday after two US warships sailed by an island in the disputed Paracel Island chain.
"You'll notice there's only one country that seems to take active steps to rebuff (such operations) or state their resentment of them, but it's international waters and a lot of nations want to see freedom of navigation, so we will continue that," Mattis told reporters as he flew to Hawaii.
The US Navy periodically conducts "freedom of navigation" operations in the contested waterway, where it sails close to island features China has built into military facilities as a way of showing it rejects any territorial claims. "We are going out of our way to cooperate with Pacific nations, that's the way we do business in the world, but we are also going to confront what we believe is out of step with international law," Mattis said.
Sunday's operation was conducted just over a week after Beijing flew nuclear-capable bombers to a disputed island, drawing immediate criticism from the US.
Last week, the Pentagon pulled its invitation to China to join maritime exercises in the Pacific over Beijing's "continued militarization" of the South China Sea.
Beijing has been building artificial islands to reinforce its claim over most of the resource-rich South China Sea, despite protests from Southeast Asian countries.
Its neighbors, particularly some of those involved in maritime disputes over the waters, have expressed fears China could eventually restrict freedom of navigation and overflight.
"Our diplomats are robustly engaged on this," Mattis said.
"The concerns have come to me not just from American government circles, but also from foreign nations that are concerned, very concerned about this continued militarization of features in the South China Sea."
Mattis was heading to Hawaii to attend a change-of-command ceremony for the US military's Pacific Command.
The current head, Admiral Harry Harris, has been nominated to be the new ambassador to South Korea. He will be replaced by Admiral Philip Davidson.
Mattis is then due to attend a regional security conference in Singapore.

Kato Lubwama Formally Taken to Court over Fake Academic Documents
By Serestino Tusingwire
Habib Buwembo on Friday 30th December, 2016 formally filed an election petition challenging Kato Lubwama's academic qualifications.
This came 11 days after court presided over by Justice Oumo-Oguli allowed Buwembo to file a petition despite the fact that it was already past the stipulated time to file election petitions.
Section 60 of the Parliamentary Elections Act, had stood in Buwembo's way, since it stipulates that an MP's election can be challenged within 30 days after being gazetted, yet Buwembo petitioned months after.
However, Justice Oumo-Oguli, reasoned out that the case was very special because she cited fraud in the way Lubwama was nominated for the election without accurate academic papers.
“Fraud is a serious allegation and it should be taken seriously and carefully. It cannot be just wished away just because of a technicality. Matters pertaining to an MP's qualification are of great national importance. ” Justice Oumo-Oguli ruled.
Unlike his earlier application where he targeted Lubwama and the Electoral Commission, Buwembo has now added Makerere University to his suit.
He accuses Makerere University of erroneously, illegally and fraudulently admitting Lubwama through the Mature Entry Scheme to study a diploma programme leading to the award of a Diploma in Music, Dance and Drama on January 20 1995.
Meanwhile, Lubwama also awaits Justice Margaret Oumo-Oguli's decision to allow him to appeal against her ruling that gave Buwembo the go ahead to sue the MP.
The judge will decide whether Kato should appeal on January 5.
