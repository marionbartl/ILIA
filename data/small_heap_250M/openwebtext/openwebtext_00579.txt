Sydney's Opal public transport smart card is about to become the default option for a lot more people, with 14 current paper tickets no longer available as of September 1. Here's how to make the most of it so you can minimise your spend and maximise your value.
In Australian terms, Sydney is stupidly late to the smartcard party: it's already the established approach in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and Canberra (and in Melbourne there are no paper non-Myki tickets at all). There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the previous T-Card project was aborted partway through implementation, which was bound to slow things up.
Secondly, Sydney has always had a mildly insane fares system in which individual forms of transport require separate tickets. In most other capitals, you can switch from a train to a bus on a standard 2-hour ticket; that's not been a possibility in Sydney during my lifetime. Most smartcard fare implementations have tended to assume this kind of transfer is possible.
The big change which has been discussed a lot (including here at Lifehacker) is that the shift to Opal means that monthly, quarterly and yearly tickets — which attracted a discount — have disappeared. That's bad news if you used one, but transport statistics suggest that this does not apply to most people. As commenter Beau Giles points out, just 5.6 per cent of train journeys involve a periodical ticket.
How It Works
The basics of Opal are like most other smart cards: you acquire a card (either a registered one ordered online mailed to you or an unregistered one from a retailer) and put some money on it. Every time you travel, you need to tap on and tap off, and a fee for your journey will be deducted.
There's no direct equivalent of a weekly ticket on Opal. Instead, there's what's known as the "Travel Reward". After you have made eight paid journeys, all subsequent trips are free. So if you travel to and from work on the train five days a week, you'll only pay for the Monday to Thursday.
Of course, that's not very helpful if you need both a bus and a train, as you'll have to pay for each separately. Opal handles that with daily and weekly limits. No matter what you do, you can't spend more than $15 a day or $60 a week on Opal-enabled services. (A current MyMulti3 ticket — which also lets you travel on anything within the greater Sydney area — costs $63, so this is cheaper for public transport addicts.)
Opal now works on all Sydney trains and ferries, but not on all buses — that's promised by the end of the year. If your regular bus isn't covered, then sticking with a TravelTen or MyMulti is going to be better value until the change happens.
Money-Saving tricks
Those rules are complex enough to have many customers confused. So how you can you ensure you spend as little as possible?
Remember to tap off every time
If you don't tap off at the end of every journey, you'll be charged the maximum possible fare for the method of transport you last used ($7.00 on a ferry or $8.10 on a train — the assumption is a bus driver would notice, it seems). That's likely to be a lot higher than you would have been charged otherwise. An added incentive: if you fail to tap off, your journey doesn't count towards your weekly "travel reward" (though it does count towards your daily $15 maximum cap).
The situation where this is most likely to happen is on trains, since many stations don't have gates that force you to use Opal. If you're having trouble remembering, set an alarm on your phone when you board your train that will go off when you leave.
On trains, travel outside of peak hours
On trains, fares are higher if you travel during peak hours Monday to Friday. Within the Sydney Trains network, peak hours are between 0700 and 0900 and between 1600 and 1830. If you're travelling from the broader NSW TrainLink network (from Wollongong, Gosford/Newcastle or the Blue Mountains and surrounds), the morning peak is slightly earlier — 0600 to 0800.
Your fare is calculated based on when you tap on, not when you tap off. So if you're currently catching a train that leaves just after 0700, switching to one that leaves just before will save you some money. Similarly, if you can start your journey before 1600, you'll spend less.
Enjoy free breaks in your journey
One big change with Opal: you can leave a train or bus service and then rejoin the line without having to pay a second fare. Provided you rejoin within 60 minutes, it doesn't count as a separate trip. This is useful if you want to make a quick shopping stop on the way home, or if you want to use the toilets at Central while waiting to transfer. You could also combine this with the previous off-peak idea: start your journey before 1600, stop for a quick meeting on the way, and your fare will be cheaper overall.
Take bonus trips to cut your fare
The weekly reward applies when you make any eight journeys using the same method — they don't have to be the same distance. So if you (for instance) work in the CBD and use the train to go to lunch, you'll add an extra journey — one that might be cheaper than your usual trip to or from home. This won't work for everyone, but it does give you an extra incentive to use public transport when you might avoid it otherwise.
Cheaper airport trips
You'll still have to pay a $12.60 station access fee to visit the Domestic and International airports — but the total you'll pay in a week is capped at $21. That means if you're making a day or overnight trip, using the airport stations will be somewhat cheaper. (This matches the price of a weekly GatePass, but doesn't require you to have a weekly ticket to buy it.)
Travel on Sundays
On Sundays, the maximum fare is $2.50 all day (and if you've hit the $60 maximum, you won't even pay that), no matter where you go. This is a welcome improvement: previously that fare was only available to people with children. But we're guessing that the Manly ferry is going to be even more crowded than it is now on most Sundays.

Hillary Clinton attends a signing for her new book in Manhattan, September 12, 2017. (Reuters photo: Andrew Kelly)
The failed candidate's awkward book misfires on all fronts, obsesses over sexism, and even drags David Foster Wallace into the whole mess.
In What Happened, Hillary Clinton's new 512-page recollection of what was perhaps the most painful and awkward election in American history, the former secretary of state recounts an infamous debate moment she shared with Donald Trump:
We were on a small stage, and no matter where I walked, he followed me closely, staring at me, making faces. It was incredibly uncomfortable. He was literally breathing down my neck. My skin crawled.
In her mind, Clinton recounts, she weighed two options:
Do you stay calm, keep smiling, and carry on as if he weren't repeatedly invading your space? Or do you turn, look him in the eye, and say loudly and clearly, “Back up, you creep, get away from me, I know you love to intimidate women but you can't intimidate me, so back up.”

Option B, as the kids like to say, would have escalated things rather quickly, with the added bonus of seeming a teeny bit unhinged. Hillary, of course, chose the more repressed Option A: “I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.”
Ah, yes. It's difficult to pinpoint the most painful Hillary Clinton moment of the many painful Hillary Clinton moments that populate What Happened, but this one certainly comes close. Think about it: Even now, after months of time to reflect and ruminate and engage in self-soothing techniques like downing Chardonnay and “one-nostril breathing,” Hillary Clinton is completely oblivious to what any decent politician would have realized, if not in the heat of the moment, at least in hindsight: There was an obvious Option C.
I'm referring, of course, to one of my favorite moments in presidential debate history, when a rather creepy Al Gore sidled up to a cheerful George W. Bush, looking as if he may or may have been considering a duel or a gentlemanly bout of fisticuffs. The year was 2000, and the heated topic that catapulted Gore's blood pressure skyward — brace yourself, for in the scope of today's tabloid-splashed politics, this will seem rather quaint — was the details of the “Dingell-Norwood Bill.” Gore edged closer, quietly lurking, deadly serious. After ignoring him for a few moments, Bush turned, acted mildly surprised to see him, and greeted him with a bemused, dismissive nod.
The audience broke into laughter. They loved it. Gore did not.
Well, as we all know, Hillary Clinton is no George W. Bush. She is also, as What Happened strains to remind us over and over and over again, no Donald Trump. And while many Americans might wonder why on earth anyone would spend their free time reading a book rehashing what should be fairly obvious by now — Hillary Clinton is not a very good politician — What Happened does manage to offer some valuable insights. Unfortunately, they're not the ones the author intends.
What Happened does manage to offer some valuable insights. Unfortunately, they're not the ones the author intends.
Let's talk about David Foster Wallace, shall we? Hillary Clinton does, bringing up his famous “This Is Water” commencement speech in her chapter entitled “On Being a Woman in Politics.” She's referring to the deeply moving and widely read address in which Wallace discusses human nature and life's various struggles, noting that “the most obvious realities are often the ones that are the hardest to see and talk about.” The speech opens with an anecdote about two fish who fail to recognize that they are completely immersed in water.

This, according to Clinton, “sums up the problem of recognizing sexism — especially when it comes to politics — quite nicely.”
When I read this, I briefly looked around the room, aghast, hoping to share my astonishment. Alas, I had no company, save for the battered ghost of irony silently popping pills in the corner. For heaven's sake, Hillary Clinton! Wallace was talking about self-centeredness and about our frail human tendency to cast our own obsessions and cloistered view of reality — our “lens of self” — on the world. You know, like a certain failed politician's annoying habit of blaming sexism and misogyny for at least 80 percent of anything that goes south.
Through Hillary's lens, Elizabeth Warren's problem isn't that she's a kooky socialist who could single-handedly send the economy careening off the cliff. It's that she's seen as a “shrill woman.” Most of Hillary's problems were completely self-made, and yet here she is, explaining away: “The Puritan witch hunts might be long over, but something fanatical about unruly women still lurks in our national subconscious.” Well, it lurks in someone's subconscious, certainly.

Between cutesy stories about counting the calories in Flavor Blasted Goldfish and sitting on Quest bars “to warm them up” — no, I have no idea what this means, either — and occasional eruptions of disdain toward people who weren't inspired by her desperately uninspiring campaign, a larger thread unspools throughout the pages of What Happened. Government, in Clinton's view, can solve almost every issue, from child-raising to microeconomic trends to playground interpersonal relations. (“Many kids asked what I would do about bullying, which made me want to be president even more. I had an initiative called Better Than Bullying ready to go.”)
Which brings us back to David Foster Wallace and the end notes of his “This Is Water” speech: “There is no such thing as not worshipping,” he told the students of Kenyon College. “Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship.” For many, that choice turns out to be government, or politics, or political power. One wonders whether Clinton read the full “This Is Water” speech; one also wonders whether Clinton is earnest when she writes that “the White House is sacred ground.” It certainly makes for awkward reading — just like the whole of 2016.

“It is an extremely common mistake. People think the writer's imagination is always at work, that he's constantly inventing an endless supply of incidents and episodes — that he simply dreams up his stories out of thin air. In point of fact, the opposite is true. Once the public knows you're a writer, they bring the characters and events to you. And as long as you maintain your ability to look, and to carefully listen, these stories will continue to … Stop it! Stop it! Don't! Don't do it!”

The world of Wes Anderson is a perfectly designed park that audiences have been so lucky to play in. Brimming with nostalgia, resolute framing, addled adolescence, troubled adulthood, and of course, sensationally drawn characters, Anderson builds terrific dramas and comedy of the surreally humane.
Today, in celebration of the release of Anderson's latest film, Isle of Dogs, Consequence of Sound seeks to rank those characters — for their qualities, idiosyncrasies, and all around memorability. From Sam and Suzy to Ari and Uzi. Why there's even room for Mr. Fox and Cody the three-legged dog.
But why? Because we can. Because Max Fischer would.

__________________________________________________________
161. Fire Chief
Martin Ballard, Fantastic Mr. Fox
Like the pilot, the fire chief just does what he's asked with little emotion on his face. We'd like him more if he actually enjoyed flushing animals out of their burrows, but instead, he's an empty shell of a man. –Dan Caffrey
__________________________________________________________
160. Pilot
Rob Hersov, Fantastic Mr. Fox
The pilot for Franklin Bean is nothing more than a mustachioed stooge, eager to do anything for his mean-ass boss, no matter how horrible. It's not the actions that make him bad, but his refusal to ask why he's doing them in the first place. –Dan Caffrey
__________________________________________________________
159. Grande Dame
Lisa Kreuzer, The Grand Budapest Hotel
This is a deep cut Anderson character right here. Gotta look around the edges of the framing. Cultish German actress Lisa Kreuzer as the Grande Dame was one of Gustave H.'s many bedfellows. –Blake Goble

158. Carmen
Anna Cifuentes, Bottle Rocket
No, she doesn't know where Inez is at this moment. Or where else she belongs in this film. –Michael Roffman
__________________________________________________________
157. Serge's Sister
Giselda Volodi, The Grand Budapest Hotel
Five lines: “Yes, sir?” “Yes, sir.” “No, sir.” “No, sir.” “Yes, sir.” Then she gets beheaded. –Allison Shoemaker

156. Anita
Melinda Renna, Bottle Rocket
Who could hang up on Anthony? She could. Anita doesn't get much screen time, but she has one icy resolve. –Michael Roffman

155. Rabbit Girl and Boy
Molly Copper, Fantastic Mr. Fox
Rabbit Girl and Boy's cuteness gets undercut by their crazed red eyes — unsettling in the worst way possible. –Dan Caffrey

154. Rob
Stephan Dignan, Bottle Rocket
Rob, aren't you supposed to be in literature? –Randall Colburn
__________________________________________________________
153. Dr. Badger
Jennifer Furches, Fantastic Mr. Fox
Dr. Badger gets brownie points from us because she's a pediatrician, and thus the resident healer in Fantastic Mr. Fox. She also looks exactly like her husband Clive Badger, which means he disappears all too easily in Bill Murray's shadow. –Dan Caffrey
__________________________________________________________
152. Antonia Cook
Isabella Blow, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
Antonia only shows up in brief to congratulate Zissou on his success, and what a success it was. Seriously. (We wish it didn't require the “seriously,” but hey.) –Dominick Suzanne-Mayer
__________________________________________________________
151. Mr. Beaver
Steven M. Rales, Fantastic Mr. Fox
For most of the film, the bucktoothed rodent stands there like a goon in his three-piece suit, never uttering a word or offering to help. Only when he goes on a reconnaissance mission after the animals are holed up underground does he begin to distinguish himself. –Dan Caffrey
__________________________________________________________
150. Doug, Explosives Man
Tristan Oliver, Fantastic Mr. Fox
It's great that one of the film's biggest catastrophes comes from an explosives expert who's simply named Doug. “Contact!” –Michael Roffman
__________________________________________________________
149. Antonio Monda
Antonio Monda, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
As much as it's a hoot to see the real-life professor/director/essayist/cultural giant interview Steve Zissou in The Life Aquatic, most of the good stuff ended up on the cutting-room floor. –Dan Caffrey
__________________________________________________________
148. Izod
L.J. Foley, Moonrise Kingdom
Izod is the kinda guy who will absolutely run off to get more gunpowder when so ordered. What? It's not like they can all be memorable. –Allison Shoemaker
__________________________________________________________
147. Herr Mendl
Rainer Reiners, The Grand Budapest
While he may have been a talented patisserie man … actually, Agatha did the work. Okay, while he might have had great craftsmanship and packaging design … well, again, that craft seemed like Agatha, and the design would have likely been outsourced. Yeah, alright, Herr Mendl was likely a touchy, credit-hogging, oddball loner wasn't he? –Blake Goble
__________________________________________________________
146. Doctor
Dipak Pallana, The Royal Tenenbaums
There's not much to say about Dipak Pallana's Doctor, though this won't be the actor's last appearance on this list. He's also, interestingly enough, the son of Kumar Pallana, who we'll meet later on. –Randall Colburn
__________________________________________________________
145. Rabbit's Ex-Girlfriend
Allison Abbate, Fantastic Mr. Fox
One of the many ancillary animals in The Fantastic Mr. Fox, she enjoys the title character's newspaper column, but can't be bothered to get a subscription because she's too cheap. A boring, stingy accountant. No wonder she's Mr. Rabbit's “ex” girlfriend! –Dan Caffrey
__________________________________________________________
144. Lieutenant
Neal Huff, The Grand Budapest Hotel
Anderson takes a lot of care with his films. Often even if a character's known only by a title or description, they're dynamic and feel real. This is not one of those cases. –Allison Shoemaker
__________________________________________________________
143. Dr. Nichols
Ned Dowd, Bottle Rocket
Um, seems like a nice enough guy. He lets Anthony crawl out of his window with a rope of tied bedsheets and doesn't call security, so that's pretty cool. –Randall Colburn
__________________________________________________________
142. Mr. Mosher
Larry Pine, The Grand Budapest
Mosher's not particularly interesting. But hey, he hired Zero! That's cool! –Allison Shoemaker
__________________________________________________________
141. Panagle
Andreas Sheikh, Moonrise Kingdom
Ever get the sense that Anderson likes to occupy an image with lots of people and takes joy in devising names then casting a person to fill a busy character shot? Panagle seemed like one of those inventions. –Blake Goble
__________________________________________________________
140. Bookstore Manager
Darryl Cox, Bottle Rocket
“Don't call me an idiot, you punk!” Few people, if any, could shut down Dignan. Could you imagine what a hard ass this guy is on any given day? Odds are his stockboys hate him. –Michael Roffman
__________________________________________________________
139. Anatole
Daniel Steiner, The Grand Budapest Hotel
While he doesn't do a whole lot, Anatole's got two things going for him: he looks perfect in this movie, all skinny and wobbly and stuff, and he's in every damn trailer (“The police are here”). That's about it. –Allison Shoemaker
__________________________________________________________
138. Rowboat
Tak Kubota, Bottle Rocket
Rowboat has a history with James Caan's Abe Henry. What that history is we don't exactly know. But you can't argue with a nickname like Rowboat. –Michael Roffman
__________________________________________________________
137. Alice Whitman
Camila Rutherford, The Darjeeling Limited
All that's clear about Alice Whitman from her brief scenes in The Darjeeling Limited is that she and Adrian Brody's Peter aren't doing too hot in the love department. Not a surprise, I suppose, this being a Wes Anderson film and all. –Randall Colburn
__________________________________________________________
136. Bean's Son
Garth Jennings, Fantastic Mr. Fox
Ha, what a little twerp. All covered in gunk. Bean's son probably got bad grades and was a wormy, entitled butthead, too. Call it a hunch. But nice comic relief. –Blake Goble
__________________________________________________________
135. Renzo Pietro
Pawel Wdowczak, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
You know what's pretty cool about Pietro, an otherwise forgettable character in a movie chock-full of memorable ones? He does sound for Zissou's film, and he's portrayed by the guy who was the movie's actual sound designer. Cool, now let's shag ass. –Justin Gerber
__________________________________________________________
134. Bernice
Haley Miller, Bottle Rocket
Bernice may believe that Anthony is a jet pilot, but she sure knows when to leave a conversation. –Zack Ruskin
__________________________________________________________
133. Agnes
Juman Malouf, Fantastic Mr. Fox
Agnes had nice spots. It was a tad peculiar that she got to hang with the Fox family in the end, but what do we know about foxes and their animal behavior? –Allison Shoemaker
__________________________________________________________
132. Bobby Ogata
Niels Koizumi, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
Of all the Team Zissou descriptions, “Frog Man” may be the strangest. But Ogata's a good hand. Now put out those deck fires before we sink. –Dominick Suzanne-Mayer
__________________________________________________________
131. Roosevelt
Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, Moonrise Kingdom
“Roosevelt, how's that lanyard coming?” “Horrible.” No joke — Roosevelt is very, very bad at lanyards. –Allison Shoemaker
__________________________________________________________
130. Mr. Herbert Billingsley
Larry Pine, Moonrise Kingdom
We don't spend long with Mr. Herbert Billingsley, but his phone call, in which he says he can no longer foster Sam, is a memorably heartbreaking moment. –Zack Ruskin
__________________________________________________________
129. Nico, Intern #1
Matthew Gray Gubler, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
Nico was the finest, bestest intern. The one that stayed. Nico deserves any and all extra credit. –Blake Goble
__________________________________________________________
128. Gadge
Chadler Frantz, Moonrise Kingdom
We don't know much about Gadge, but since he works as Scout Master Ward's note-taker and is the first person to notice that Snoopy's gone, we can assume he's detail-oriented. –Allison Shoemaker
__________________________________________________________
127. Mrs. Bean
Helen McCrory, Fantastic Mr. Fox
A fantastic actress in her own right, the best part about McCrory's character is the food she prepares. Stare into the “Famous Nutmeg Ginger Apple Snaps” and despair! –Justin Gerber
__________________________________________________________
126. Prisoner Günther
Volker Michalowski, The Grand Budapest Hotel
Günther. Didn't do much. Didn't say much. But, he played an instrumental role in the escape of Gustave H. from prison in Grand Budapest Hotel, and that's worth at least a mild commendation. Or maybe even a bigger piece of a Mendl's treat. –Blake Goble

Nominations for the 60th Grammy Awards were announced on Tuesday morning (list is on CNN), and there were some major shocks. The biggest shock is that Kesha and Lady Gaga were completely shut out of the major categories. Both received nominations in minor categories, but fans are still surprised. They shouldn't be.
Although Joanne is Gaga's least-selling album (in terms of physical and digital copies sold), Joanne did have some critical acclaim, which was well deserved. Once you get past Gaga's contrived new image, the album really is fantastic. If somebody tells you that Lady Gaga doesn't have any talent, this is the album you would play to prove them wrong.
But most importantly, Joanne was literally Grammy bait. Gaga put all the gimmicks aside, showed herself as a natural musician, and Grammy voters usually love this. Lady Gaga seemed to have everything going for her, and it was a safe bet that she would add more Grammy awards to her collection.
Lady Gaga's performance at the Super Bowl was well received, and one of the album's singles, “Million Reasons,” peaked at No. 4 (although the song immediately dropped off after the Super Bowl hype). Still, the song was well liked, and it was a certain contender for Song of the Year. Just as Lady Gaga was about to return to her Grammy glory, Mother Monster did as she often does during an awards campaign by annoyingly tooting her own horn.
null
Lady Gaga even wanted her fans to start a hashtag to let everybody know that Joanne went platinum. The problem is that almost any album can go platinum these days since the RIAA recently changed how it certifies albums. That means Lady Gaga (she's not the only one to do this) was able to add sales of her 69-cent discounted singles and YouTube views (which can be easily manipulated) to her total “points” in order to achieve platinum status.
Considering that Joanne didn't do nearly well as anticipated, and Gaga's new Americana image didn't take off, the tweets looked like desperate attempts to make the album look more of a hit than it really was. Considering that she made these tweets during the Grammy campaign season, it was obvious she was hoping to get more votes. And when Gaga tweeted that “Million Reasons” sold almost 2 million copies, she didn't mention that most of those copies were sold at a deeply-discounted 69 cents.
But this isn't the first time Lady Gaga turned off voters of a major awards show. She actually did receive an Oscar nomination in 2016 for the sexual harassment-themed song “Til It Happens to You,” which she claimed to write with Dianne Warren. However, once the Hollywood Reporter noted that songwriter Linda Perry claimed Gaga's songwriting credit was bogus, things went downhill.
In order to combat the backlash, Lady Gaga made appearances everywhere and claimed how victimized she still felt from being sexually assaulted 10 years prior. She also made herself an advocate for sexual assault survivors everywhere. Though this isn't wrong, the pop star made it easier for people to call her out for working with accused sexual predators R. Kelly and Terry Richardson (he worked with Gaga for several years) on a video for a song called “Do What You Want with My Body” only two years prior. The video was never officially released, but clips of it have unfortunately appeared on YouTube.
Kesha has never made a sexually explicit video with alleged sexual predators, but her experience of allegedly being assaulted by producer Dr. Luke became the cornerstone of her “comeback” and Grammy campaign. “Praying” was Grammy bait from the moment it was released, and that was well deserved. On the single, which is one of the best (if not the best) songs of the year, Kesha sings in an emotive voice that barely any pop star has ever matched. Her album Rainbow, which many thought would be nominated for Album of the Year, was also well received.

Had Kesha and her record company let the music speak for itself, she could have received nominations in three of the major categories instead of two minor ones. But the whole album and PR campaign seemed to revolve around Kesha's status as a victim. The PR campaign went so well that anybody who questioned Kesha's authenticity was accused of being “sexist” or complacent in “rape culture.”
Perhaps Kesha should have waited until her legal matters with Dr. Luke have ended. As USA Today noted a couple months back, her battle is not even close to being over. It didn't help when it was revealed that Kesha hired a PR firm to smear Dr. Luke as much as possible. And this was revealed just as the Grammy voters were casting their votes.
As their latest projects show, both Lady Gaga and Kesha still have great days ahead of them. However, if both acts want to be recognized with awards for their work, they need to change their PR strategies.
A yes-or-no question turned into a six-minute lecture by Derek Lowe. The topic of advanced statistics and their increasing popularity struck a chord with Lowe, who saw this past off-season how influential they can be.
Do players pay attention to them? “God, no.”
He took a breath and shook his head. “No.”
Lowe then gave an analogy: What do parents ask their children when they come home from a game?

“Did you win or did you lose? That's it,” Lowe said. “Nobody asks, ‘What was your WHIP?' ‘Uh … what was your WAR?' It's always, ‘Did you guys win?' ”
Started by Bill James in the 1980s, the advanced statistics movement now includes formulas that seem more suited for engineers and physicists than pitchers and outfielders.
Batting average, RBIs and earned-run averages aren't enough these days. Now there's wOBA (weighted on-base average), UZR (ultimate zone rating), FIP (fielding independent pitching) and DIP (defense independent pitching).
Lowe talked about his tumultuous off-season when he tried to find a job. He had pitched well at the end of last season and had a long, respectable career. But it didn't add up to offers.
Lowe, who turns 40 on June 1, didn't find a team until the first week of March when the Texas Rangers signed him to a minor-league contract with an opportunity to become the team's long reliever.
Lowe won the job with the Rangers and has since found out that at least three teams wanted to sign him in a similar capacity. However, he didn't pass the “stats test.”
“If you pump my numbers into the system compared to, let's say, Tanner Scheppers, of course his stuff is going to outscore my stuff, I'm not naive,” Lowe said. “He's a young kid who throws 98 mph with a great breaking ball. Listen, I know I don't pass the test.
“But it doesn't take into consideration the human element of sports. Don't get me wrong, I think those stats can be beneficial. But I use more of a human element. Where has the guy had success? What cities has he had success? What cities has he failed at? Has he performed well when it matters?
“I'm a big believer in winners and losers. Guys that know how to win, and they're not always the superstar players. There are guys that don't perform well when push comes to shove, but those things don't show up in statistical data.”
As Rangers catcher A.J. Pierzynski said, “At the end of the day, if your team wins, everything else takes care of itself. As a catcher, if I stink at the plate but get our pitcher through six, seven innings, it's a good day.”
Rising popularity
While players might not pay close attention to advanced metrics, there's no question about increasing relevance.
Bill James, the father of sabermetrics, got the movement started in the 1980s, and it's taken off ever since.
Hollywood made a movie on it two years ago, based on the book Moneyball, which took an in-depth look at how Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane constructed his team, based largely on numbers.
Rangers manager Ron Washington was the A's third-base coach during the Moneyball years, and remembers a few animated conversations with Beane. The most vivid was when Beane tried to convince Washington that Frank Menechino was a better defensive second baseman than Mark Ellis.
“You can look at Mark Ellis and Frank Menechino and there's no comparison,” Washington said. “Mark Ellis doesn't miss anything hit his way, turns the double play as well as anybody. … Defense, to me, is still an eye test.”
Trying to quantify defense is one of the flaws of arguably the most popular advanced stat in the game today, WAR — wins above replacement. The stat, which is computed different ways by baseball-reference.com and fangraphs.com, is used to determine the overall worth of a player by factoring in his offense, defense and base running compared to that of a “replacement” player.
Baseball-reference.com has a lengthy explanation on the intricacies of WAR, complete with graphs and charts of how it's calculated.
Part of it reads, “The idea behind the WAR framework is that we want to know how much better a player is than what a team would typically have to replace that player. We start by comparing the player to average in a variety of venues and then compare our theoretical replacement player to the average player and add the two results together.”
What is a replacement player?
As Yahoo! Sports' baseball blog, Big League Stew, writes: “A replacement player is defined as someone who is below average and should be easily obtainable, the sort of fringy cup-of-coffee guy you can find in Triple A, on the waiver wire, or acquire for a PTBNL, a warm body who hurts the team the more he plays.”
In other words, WAR is a little more involved than batting average ( hits divided by at-bats) or on-base percentage ( hits plus walks plus hit by pitch divided by plate appearances).
But WAR has made its way into the mainstream, as shown by last year's debate on who should be the American League's Most Valuable Player.
The stats-based segment of fans felt the award should go to Angels outfielder Mike Trout, even though the Tigers' Miguel Cabrera became the first player to win the Triple Crown since 1967. Cabrera, who won the award, led the league in batting average (.330), home runs (44) and RBIs (139).
Trout had a 10.9 WAR, though, while Cabrera had a 7.3, according to baseball-reference.com.
“The AL MVP race last year was the watershed moment when some of these advanced metrics became a major part of the debate to determine who was the best player,” said Sean Forman, founder of baseball-reference.com. “Ten years ago, it would have been Cabrera in a landslide, but now there is much more debate about it.”
Still, Forman understands that most casual fans don't entirely grasp the concept of WAR or the other advanced statistics that have become popular such as weighted on-base average (wOBA), ultimate zone rating (UZR), fielding independent pitching (FIP) and defense independent pitching (DIP).
“The casual fan will find it unnerving to have somebody say that batting average or fielding percentage isn't really important compared to other things, but that's why we present both types of numbers on the site,” Forman said. “But once you see teams making decisions based on these numbers, that'll push fans to accept it.”
Front-office implications
Jon Daniels, the Rangers' president of baseball operations/general manager, recently spoke at a Baseball Prospectus gathering and recalled being a guest for a Society for American Baseball Research event last spring where he and a few other GMs were asked about their stats departments.
To the surprise of many, Daniels revealed he doesn't have a statistical team in place.
Instead, most in the Rangers' front office have an understanding of the advanced statistics and blend it together with the scouting reports. So far, that structure has worked out well for the Rangers.
“We rely more heavily on scouting reports than statistical analysis,” assistant general manager Thad Levine said. “We have guys that can crunch the numbers, but that's not all they do.”
When it came to signing Lowe during spring training, for instance, Levine said it was a combination of scouting reports, the makeup of the player and recommendations from those within the industry.
Another example of the Rangers going with scouting over stats is when they drafted starter Justin Grimm out of the University of Georgia in the fifth round of the 2010 draft.
Grimm had gone 3-7 with a 5.49 ERA his junior season, but the Rangers saw something they could develop. Grimm has since reached the big leagues and was recently named the AL Rookie of the Month for April.
The Rangers have stats-based signings, as well. Levine said reliever Jason Frasor might not blow you away on the scouting reports, but he had a long track record of success as a reliever in one of the toughest divisions (AL East).
The advancement of stats has taken Levine by surprise. He got his first job in the game back in 1999 as someone who was ahead of the curve from an analytical standpoint, but it has grown substantially in the past 10 to 15 years.
“It's changed dramatically,” Levine said. “There are always people who are looking to produce the next new formula. And it tells you something when teams hire people away from FanGraphs and Baseball Prospectus to work for them.”
The Houston Astros might be at the forefront of the stats movement with a front-office staff that includes Sig Mejdal, a former NASA engineer, as director of decision sciences. Houston also hired Kevin Goldstein, a Baseball Prospectus writer, as its pro scouting coordinator.
Other teams, such as the Brewers, find themselves straddling the line between scouting and stats, similar to the Rangers' approach.
Milwaukee general manager Doug Melvin has a baseball research department that works with the scouting department. But Melvin is hesitant to read too much into advanced stats such as WAR.
“The problem with the newer stats is everybody has different formulas,” Melvin said. “We won 96 games with Prince Fielder [in 2011] and somebody told me his WAR was 6. So, if we lose him, we should still win 90 games, right? And they said, ‘No, that's not the way it works.'
“So how do we value WAR? I don't understand what that actually means or how to implement it in putting a team together. And the numbers are only based on that year's performance; it doesn't mean it'll be predictive of next year's performance.”
Josh Hamilton is a good example. He had a 3.7 WAR last season for the Rangers, but that number had dropped to minus- 0.8 through his first 35 games with the Angels.
As Melvin said, “Someone once told me that baseball is a series of random events that provide an unpredictable outcome, and I still think there is a lot of truth to that.”
Stats that matter
While WAR and wOBA and UZR might not mean much to players, there are a handful of stats that managers and players study before every game.
Ron Washington pays attention to how his batters have fared against right- and left-handed pitchers. He'll also look at stolen bases and the tendencies when teams hit and run.
Pierzynski likes to look at an opposing pitcher's count and location charts, but said, “There are so many things you can look at, but until you step into a batter's box it's hard to quantify what they're trying to do.”
Said Rangers outfielder David Murphy: “I just like to know what percentage of the time they throw each pitch. I don't want to go up there looking for a fastball if they throw a changeup 60 percent of the time. Other than that, I keep things simple up there. I'm just a see-it-and-hit-it kind of guy.”
For a veteran pitcher such as Lowe, he can rely more on his previous history with a certain batter. He tends to remember what worked well and what didn't, for the most part.
Lowe also likes to know a batter's hot zone — where he is hitting .380 compared to .110, for instance.
“Once you get all this information, you pick and choose what works for you,” Lowe said.
That's probably the same approach your casual baseball fans will have with advanced metrics. Some of the numbers will register and mean something to them, and others won't.
Lance Berkman summed it up nicely.
“I don't even know if your casual fans are going to care about batting averages, they just come to the game and want their team to win,” Berkman said. “The difference between a .275 and a .300 average … it's just numbers to them.
“People have been trying for years to try to quantify what they see. To me, the beauty of baseball is you can't. It's an impossibility.”
This is ugly. Uglier than it ever should have been. Neither side should be proud of the entirety of its actions.
There is no denying the fiasco this has become between the Chargers and Joey Bosa.
Go ahead, let it all out. Opinions, curse words, guttural screams of frustration over why the Chargers seem to so often find themselves in these mires.
But don't lose sleep. Understand that it won't matter. This, too, shall pass.
Probably.
Team Chargers? Team Bosa? Annie went out and about to get fan reaction to the ongoing Joey Bosa drama. Team Chargers? Team Bosa? Annie went out and about to get fan reaction to the ongoing Joey Bosa drama. SEE MORE VIDEOS
Teammates will embrace Joey Bosa. Fans will cheer him.
He has to sign. He has to perform. And he has to let it go, the same way hundreds of players all around the NFL have let it go before him, growing to see their teammates (not the owner) as their team.
If he does, everyone will move on.
Brian Ayrault, Bosa's agent, said Wednesday that the Chargers pulling their latest contract offer and detailing it for the masses inflicted damage.
Via a written statement, Ayrault said, “The team surely is not strengthening its relationship with Joey Bosa by taking this stance and making their position public.”
OK, OK. We all say things.
The stuff that gets said – mostly behind the scenes – in these disputes is the same kind of thing that gets thrown out in squabbles every day all over the world. Things like “I'll never” and “unforgivable” and “the worst.”
And then, yes, it passes.
As difficult as it is to fathom right now, as much as in the moment this appears to be as fractured as a relationship could get, practically irreparable, everyone should probably pull up a chair and listen to a tale about a crotchety old gunslinger.
On Aug. 9, 2004, after the Chargers made what they called their “final” offer to first-round pick Philip Rivers, then-General Manager A.J. Smith stood before the media at training camp in Carson and said:
"We offered a great deal to Philip. We also notified his agent, Jimmy Sexton, that the offer will stand until 5 p.m. Sunday evening and, if not accepted, the offer would be pulled off the table. Our offer was rejected. This is very unfortunate and disappointing, but it is what it is. … I hope I've made our position very clear. If he decides to sign a contract with the San Diego Chargers, then I'll be more than happy to talk about Philip Rivers."
Philip Rivers eventually signed that month and has signed two more extensions with the team.
That wasn't the only negotiation to go bad and then become a faded memory. Not just with the Chargers, either, contrary to a popular narrative.
Bosa can eventually get to work and make everyone love him. He can even have a good relationship with his employers.
LaDainian Tomlinson did not sign his rookie contract until Aug. 22. Three years later, the Chargers made him the highest-paid running back in history. Antonio Gates was suspended by the team for the first game of 2005 as a means of getting him to sign, and signed a rich deal with them five years later and then signed another contract this year. We could go on.
History all but assures this will work out similarly, or that Bosa will at least be welcomed into the family at some point.
However – and at this point, given the latest social media post by his mother and his agent's statement and, more than anything, the unprecedented stance the Bosa camp has taken to this point, we can't rule it out – there is the possibility this ends horribly.
In fact, Bosa has the power to make the image of the Chargers as fools as lasting as concrete.
Oh, can he ever flip this on the team. If he does, it would be too much to say the Chargers would never recover, but …
If Bosa has the fortitude to delay his NFL career for a year – forfeiting several million dollars and sacrificing a year of potential free agency – he wins. He loses, for sure. But he wins this war. Like dropping an atomic bomb.
Bosa is not Bo Jackson, who refused to sign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after they selected him first overall in 1986. Bosa doesn't have the option to play baseball. But he could at least re-enter the draft next year.
The Chargers would essentially forfeit the No. 3 pick. They would get nothing for their 4-12 effort of 2016.
That's a look off which you can't wipe the ugly.
That would be so embarrassing it could make people forget about how embarrassing Ryan Leaf was.
(But, hey, the Chargers would save $26 million. They could sign Melvin Ingram and Danny Woodhead to extensions, pay Mark Fabiani's salary and maybe have a little left to launch the next stadium campaign.)
If that is how Bosa proceeds, you have to respect him. You can disagree with someone and still respect their stand.
It would be easier for him to come in and be the football player he says he wants to be.
Everything would be forgiven all around. Probably.

Normally, I love America's cute Southern drawl. Normally, sweet old ladies who generously bake apple pies for their friends are entirely inoffensive to me. But Tree Trunks can die alone in a forest somewhere in the Land of Ooo and it'd be her best appearance in an episode of Adventure Time.
Tree Trunks is a tiny, yellowish-greenish elderly elephant who lives near the forests in the Candy Kingdom. She tends to her garden of apples, making apparently-delicious apple pies for her friends.
When we first meet Tree Trunks during her more minor roles at the start of Adventure Time, she seems like an unassuming character. She's kind of slow moving and she definitely lives in her own world, but she's kind enough. Who could hate a little old lady who frequently bakes Candy Kingdom-renowned apple pies for her buds Finn and Jake? Right?
Me. I hate her. I'm the one. And I don't feel the slightest bit bad about it. Tree Trunks is oblivious at best, selfish and frankly gross at worst.
In her first major episode, “Tree Trunks,” she gets Finn and Jake caught in an increasingly dangerous situation thanks to her complete disregard of them and their efforts to protect her. And the only thing she ever feels bad about is how she might be perceived, or how she feels in relation to how Finn and Jake's troubles involve her.
Advertisement
Before all this, we see moments of her true character coming through in various episodes. Finn and Jake are horsing around in Tree Trunks' backyard when she invites them in for some freshly-baked apple pie.
What a sweet-looking lady, right?
Not 30 seconds later we see her entirely aggressive reaction to a fly landing on her pie. Now, you are probably thinking, “But it's just a fly! Surely this is a familiar occasion that years of baking pies and living in the goddamn forest full of other suchs bugs and creatures would have prepared her for.” What a right observation you've made! But, nah.
Advertisement
Look at it. Look at those motions towards violence her flung-up arms are presenting. Look at those angry wrinkles on her forehead, her mouth agape in voicing her rage. It's a fly, Tree Trunks. Calm yourself.
The invasion of the fly who acts in its nature is so jarring to her, in fact, that she's almost possessed by her disturbance.
Advertisement
I mean…
Advertisement
I'm terrified.
And then she goes and wastes a perfectly good pie for one point of contamination.
Advertisement
Those boys do not care one bit about some tiny hairs on the tiny legs of a tiny housefly landing in a tiny little perimeter of your apple pie. And, even if they were, they could cut around it like I would.
Tree Trunks, do you know how many people would fight in a gladiatorial stadium against their own family members for that pie? Do you know how hungry people are out there? Do you ever turn on the news?
Anyway she manages to convince Finn and Jake to take her on a dangerous adventure to find the “apple of apples” to make the best apple pie ever. Not a bad deal for anyone involved, but it did kind of play out like she manipulated Finn and Jake into being her bodyguards for this thing, but, whatever, they do generally enjoy adventures at least.
Advertisement
Now, I'm fully aware that Tree Trunks is at the mercy of her old age and her likely waning mental clarity. But her complete lack of awareness and understanding and listening skills are still annoying.
Here she is, in the midst of the dark forest, acting like she knows anything when she almost got eaten by a wall of flesh. (Yes, a wall of flesh. Adventure Time is weird.)
Advertisement
She proceeds to wander off, continue to act an oblivious fool, and get Finn beaten to shit while he tries to protect her from all the dangers she keeps walking straight into.
And when poor Finn—with his jacked-up, black and blue face—laments the position he got stuck in, her only reaction is a selfish one. “Are you mad at me?” She widens her eyes into a glistening, puppy-dog demeanor and Finn's guilt overrides his pain. Because Finn has empathy and Tree Trunks happily—and, sure, maybe unknowingly—takes advantage of that.
Advertisement
Wonderfully, Tree Trunks also has a large ego. And many of us have seen how a combination of ego and a lack of empathy play out—it's generally pretty ugly and involves their personality running rampant at the expense of others' well being. While Finn takes on yet another monster, Tree Trunks throws some makeup on and goes against Jake's directives to stay put.
Oh, yeah, cause that's gonna work. Have you looked in a mirror Tree Trunks? I hear YouTube has some great makeup tutorials. Just saying: Tree Trunks doesn't know shit.
Advertisement
(Actually, based on evidence presented in the show and completely not based on my own personal opinion of her, Tree Trunks does seem to have some effective wiles about her. Though for the record I have no idea why or what people see in her.)
At the end of all this, Tree Trunks becomes a crystal-possessed, evil ruler of the Crystal Dimension and tries to crystalize Finn to force him to rule with her. When she comes to after Finn and Jake rescue her from his crystal-minded prison, she confesses she “likes” Finn. Let's all remember that she's an old lady and Finn is a teenager. Not just weird but illegal, too, though I confess to not knowing much about the laws of the Candy Kingdom.
Next, in “Apple Thief,” Tree Trunks is so consumed by her own priorities of finding whoever stole her apples that even when she finds Raggedy princess in a fucking ditch in her front yard after being knocked down there by some “ne'er-do-wells,” all she continues to care about is that maybe they were the same people who stole her apples and oh god her apples. Who cares that this woman was just attacked when there are apples to be reclaimed?! Vengeance will be Tree Trunks'!

In “Dream of Love,” Tree Trunks falls in love with Mr. Pig, the character she was introduced to in “Apple Thief.” Love is a wonderful thing, but excessive PDA is not, especially when the people around you are explicitly asking for you to stop grossing them out. In fact, they bother the attendees of Princess Bubblegum's party/concert so much that Cinnamon Bun calls the whole thing off.
And not only that, but Tree Trunks has the nerve to ask Princess Bubblegum to perform a song specifically for them, to dance “cheek-to-cheek” to, after they've ruined the whole party for everyone else.
Advertisement
When Finn suggests they need to hide their affection to not make the whole world throw up, they decide the best option is not to hole up in their house like a normal couple does when they're in the new-couple stage of not being able to keep their hands off each other. Nope, they decide to try to “hide” all around the Candy Kingdom, even going so far as to invade a baby carriage while the mom who owns it isn't looking.
Gross!
She explains to Finn that she's uncomfortable with an unmarried couple living together, but as far as us viewers know, they've been doing exactly that since the “Apple Thief” episode. Mr. Pig proclaims that he “never really left” when Jake asks what he was doing at Tree Trunks' house at the start of the episode, and later tells Jake that he's “homeless.” What was that about an unmarried couple's living arrangement again?
Advertisement
When Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig finally decide to get married in “Apple Wedding,” Princess Bubblegum goes through great lengths to ensure everything runs according to plan on Tree Trunks' special day. Tree Trunks' response? She accuses Princess Bubblegum of trying to “hijack” the wedding. There's that ego rearing its ugly head again. She's so self-absorbed that she can't even see when someone is trying to do something nice for her. Now, sure, Princess Bubblegum actually does go ahead and hijack her wedding, but that comes later…
Plus, there's still this:
Advertisement
Gross. Where'd you learn how to make out? Fifth grade? You've had THREE husbands before Mr. Pig, Tree Trunks. You should know better than to air-lick each other's tongues.
“Mystery Dungeon” is actually the first episode featuring Tree Trunks at her most tolerable. She helps the group according to her abilities, and doesn't seem to require too much of an egotistical motivation to do so. Aside from saving her own butt in the process, of course. But, even when she's actually being helpful, she exhibits behavior and language that simultaneously betrays her generous exterior. She's obsessed with people liking her—a trademark sign of egomaniacs like her—a characteristic she's admitted to in a previous episode. When she's confronting Ice King's involvement in her and her group being trapped in this dungeon, she comes at it from the perspective of how it relates to her. It can't simply be a matter of Ice King having done something deplorable, which is how she starts her mini-monologue confrontation. She ropes herself into the conversation, talking about how kind and honest she is.
Tree Trunks is, simply put, an obnoxious character. And anyway, I already found the best pie place in NYC. It's called Little Pie Company and they put goddamn sour cream in their apple pie. No thanks, Tree Trunks.

Two trolley museums outside New York City have incredible pieces of history from 9/11 – the last cars from the PATH train that was trapped beneath the World Trade Center after the Twin Towers fell. Both were in the 9/11 hangar at JFK Airport and were donated to the Shore Line Trolley Museum in East Haven, Connecticut and the Kingston Trolley Museum in the Hudson Valley in 2015. Both are on view already and both museums will have special events, opening up PATH train Car 745 for the first time to the public on September 11th next month.
A few months ago, while tracking down the Mineola, August Belmont Jr.'s private subway car which is also in the collection of the Shore Line Trolley Museum, we had the opportunity to step inside Car 745. It was a sobering, reflective moment – the advertisements are still there as well as the signage on the front of the train, that says “WTC.” Shaun Winton, director of the Shore Line Trolley Museum, told us that coffee cups and other items were found inside – literally abandoned in the rush to evacuate.
In the minutes after the first plane hit at 8:46 am, three PATH trains were pulling into the World Trade Center station. One was arriving from Newark and two others from Hoboken. Amidst the chaos, quick thinking by PATH deputy director Victoria Cross Kelly and trainmaster Richie Moran, who was in the Port Authority Trans Hudson Control Center located in Jersey City, saved the lives of countless potential passengers who would have entered the World Trade Center site later when the foundations were much less stable.
Moran sent a command to the first Hoboken train to literally turn around at the World Trade Center station without stopping, not letting off passengers or opening any doors. The Newark-arriving train was filled with more passengers and left the station. The second Hoboken train, which arrived on Track 3 of the World Trade Center at 8:52 am, was ordered to be evacuated completely, employees included.
This second Hoboken train never left the World Trade Center complex, and was found later in 2001 during the long, recovery process. Only two cars of the seven cars on the train survived, the others were crushed in the collapse of the Twin Towers. It took a week to excavate the train, in an area accessible through an emergency exit hatchway that was still intact on West Street near Vesey Street, the Shore Line Trolley Museum recounts.
Peter Rinaldi, senior engineering manager with the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, climbed onto the platform of the PATH station, walked through the doors of Car 745, that were left open. The museum writes, “He stepped aboard the car and into the operating cab and at that moment became determined that, somehow, this car must be saved. Over 14 years later, his vision became a reality as car 745 touched down on trolley museum rails and became part of our collection.” Car 745 was the front car that day and the museum says it is shown “exactly as it was found.”
In addition to theCar 745 itself, the Shore Line Trolley Museum also has pieces of the PATH train tunnel itself from World Trade Center, which was intended to be incorporated into the exhibit.
The PATH Train Car 143 from 9/11 at the Kingston Trolley Museum
Up at the Kingston Trolley Museum, Car 143 of the same Hoboken train, sits in the yard emblazoned with an American flag and a sign that reads “Last Train,” with the symbols of the Twin Towers. As Eric Garces, President of the Kingston Trolley Museum recounts, Car 143 cars were part of the first series of cars purchased by the Port Authority for the new PATH train, running from 1965 until September 11th, 2001. It was the second car in the train found under the World Trade Center and appears to have sustained more damage than Car 745, with many windows blown in.
The Kingston Trolley Museum received their car after the Shore Line Trolley Museum, said one of the workers on site when we visited. They are still fundraising what's needed to create an exhibition for the car – at only $1610 of their $14,000 goal. They will also open their car to the public for the first time on September 11th this year.
We're planning to organize an Untapped city tour to the Shore Line Trolley Museum to see the World Trade Center PATH train, August Belmont Jr's private subway car and more from the incredible collection. Sign up for advance notice of this tour here:

The woman who inspires me most is a woman whom I have often professed to absolutely despise. Dear readers beware! This essay is no heart-warming tale about a valiant old grandmother or selfless missionary worker. This is a story of jealousy and competition, a twisted cycle of hatred, love, and inspiration that has been a part of my life since I was born. You see, I have the great privilege -- and deep misfortune -- of being the brother of a prodigy.
Announcements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners ‘Punch to the Gut' Musical on Residential Schools Returns to Vancouver Children of God has been shaped by intense audience reactions, says director Corey Payette.
My older sister entered the world a year and a half before I did, the first of many races in which she would emerge the victor. Of course, it wasn't a contest then. She was not yet Robyn the Prodigy, whose accomplishments eclipsed my own. She was only Robyn, my sister and playmate, my guide and my protector. My earliest memory of Robyn is of her stroking my hair and reading me a story. I sometimes wonder if she, too, remembers that moment. I hope so. It's nice to remember that before we were rivals, we were friends -- that there was a time when she would read to me and stroke my hair with tiny hands.
I am me
Being the brother of Robyn Thom is something like walking around with a large bird on my head -- it is impossible to forget that she is there, even if I cannot see her. It is inevitable, on the first day of a new school year, that at least one of my teachers will glance at his or her attendance list and say, "Thom....hmm...you wouldn't happen to be Robyn's brother, would you?"
Said teacher will then proceed to rattle off a list of Robyn's achievements, which include winning the international science fair, inventing a new type of plastic, swimming competitively at a national level, achieving a near-perfect score on the SAT, and, most recently, gaining an acceptance to Harvard University. I will then smile and suppress the almost irresistible urge to smack that teacher with a binder. No, I always want to say. My name is not Robyn's Brother. My blood may whisper her name, but I am not only a shadow. I am me.
Intense competition
When I was seven years old, I overheard my father say, "Yes, sir, my daughter is born to do great things." Someone replied, "What about your boy?" My father just laughed. At nine, Robyn was already a winning competitive swimmer and figure skater, straight-A student, and an excellent pianist. I was a skinny little boy who was bullied by his classmates, and had to be pushed into the water before I would learn to swim. It was that moment, I think, that I began to hate my sister. She was everything I wanted to be -- someone my father was proud of. That was when I promised myself that I would surpass Robyn -- that someday I would be the child everyone looked at admiringly, and she would be the child that everyone pitied.
The next nine years were an intense competition. Every time I studied for a test or played the piano, every time I went to a swim practice or a music festival, I did it not for myself, but because I wanted to beat my sister. Each effort was in vain. Robyn threw herself into any activity with a ferocious determination and a raw talent that was almost frightening at times. My report cards unfailingly received straight As, but hers would be in the high 90s. I would win a local music competition, but she would get a gold medal at a national swim meet. Our rivalry would often erupt in vicious fights over things like who would set the table for dinner, fights which could result in us not speaking to each other for a week.
When sister comes home
Our last, and biggest, argument was less than a year ago. I don't even remember how it began. We screamed the most horrible things at each other; I remember telling her that I hated her. That I was glad she was going to Boston for university because I couldn't stand living with her. She told me that I was worthless. A local newspaper had recently printed an article detailing her achievements, and I ripped it to pieces. It was over, I thought. I was through with trying to prove that I was just as good as my famous sister. I was through. For a moment, there was this feeling of tremendous triumph, like I was free of an enormous weight. And then I just felt empty.
Now that she's gone, her absence is palpable. I feel as though I've lost something, which is funny, because really, she's still all around me. Her collection of medals still jangles proudly in our living room at the slightest breeze, her trophies gleam mockingly from the mantelpiece. At school, people still come up to me and ask if it's true that Robyn will compete in the next Olympic trials for swimming. It's as if, now that she's no longer living with us, I can suddenly see more clearly: I can see that I need her. I can see that it is my struggle to prove that I am as good as she is that has inspired me all this time. It is her fierce determination; her will to dominate and succeed that has been reflected in me.
When my sister comes home for Christmas, there are some things I would like to tell her, but probably won't because they are too awkward to say. Somehow, though, I think she'll know what I mean. They are: I resent you. I love you. You infuriate me. And most of all, you inspire me.

CLOSE Keurig Green Mountain has agreed to be acquired by JAB Holding Co. for about $13.9 billion in cash, while General Electric has abandoned plans to sell its appliance business to Electrolux due to U.S. anti-trust regulators. Bloomberg

Keurig Green Mountain, which manufactures coffee makers and instant flavor pods, has agreed to be purchased for $13.9 billion by an investment group led by private-equity firm JAB Holding Co.
The purchasers include the backers of Netherlands-based Jacobs Douwe Egberts, a global tea and coffee company formed in 2014 as the combination of the coffee franchises of Oreo-maker Mondelez International and D.E Master Blenders.
The deal marks a nearly 78% premium over Friday's closing price for Keurig shares. The stock rose 72% to close Monday at $88.89.
The move comes amid slumping sales of the pods and brewers that Keurig made popular. The company has been cutting costs, including slashing 5% of its workforce in August, and introducing products to offset the downturn in its core offerings.
The deal suggests that the paths of Keurig and JAB's other properties — including Jacobs Douwe Egberts, Peet's Coffee & Tea and Caribou Coffee — may intersect as JAB seeks to reverse Keurig's fortunes. JAB said it would operate Keurig (GMCR) as an independent, private subsidiary based in Waterbury, Vt.
The Keurig purchase is likely part of a much bigger global strategy by JAB to "consolidate coffee in Europe and the United States" by becoming a major global player, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Pablo Zaunic said in a conference call Monday.
Keurig representatives declined to comment on the deal, and JAB did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
"Keurig Green Mountain represents a major step forward in the creation of our global coffee platform," JAB Chairman Bart Becht said in a statement. "It is a fantastic company that uniquely brings together premium coffee brands and new beverage dispensing technologies like the famous Keurig single-serve machine."
Until the deal was announced, Keurig shares had fallen 61% for the year as investors reconsidered the company's growth prospects.
Keurig's revenue fell 13% to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 26. That included a 9% drop in the sale of pods, which represented 83% of the company's revenue for the quarter, and a 32% drop in the sale of brewers and accessories.
The Coca-Cola Co., Keurig's largest shareholder, said it is backing the deal, which comes more than two months after the introduction of the Keurig KOLD system, which allows users to make carbonated drinks at home.
The company also recently introduced pods used to create single-serve helpings of Campbell Soup.
Keurig has played a central role in changing the market for coffee brewed at home and in the workplace. The company's pods, which come in many flavors, are inserted into a tabletop Keurig machine, which makes coffee and other beverages such as hot chocolate and tea.

Georgia, like many other states, is suffering from the drought. Here's Drought Monitor's assessment of the current state of drought in the southeast; Georgia is affected far more than any other state in the region.
More than half of the state is experiencing at least moderate drought; 17 percent is seeing “exceptional” conditions.
If you ask state officials, however, you get the real story: Drought? Whatsa drought?
Environmentalists, scientists and farmers point to places like the Flint [River], as well as reservoir levels and stream and rainfall data as proof of drought. Republican Gov. Nathan Deal and much of the business community contend that there is no drought. Unlike his predecessor, Deal has yet to declare one.
The state's resistance to more drastic measures stems from its desire to protect its business-friendly image, critics say. “Atlanta is the brightest symbol of the ‘New South,' and the Southern miracle depends on the use of natural resources,” said Gordon Rogers, executive director of Flint Riverkeeper, an environmental group. “And the key resource is water.”
So the logic goes: For Georgia to attract investment, people have to believe that it has abundant resources. And if the state declares drought, people might think that there's no water and no one will ever move there, or something. Seems smart. North Carolina smart.
The state is also trying to avoid hammering the water-intensive landscaping industry.
The last drought, in 2007-08, hit metro Atlanta harder than this one. So, the state took dire steps to ensure adequate water supplies. Then-Gov. Sonny Perdue, a Republican, rallied folks to pray for rain. But Georgians say what mattered most was that Perdue talked up the drought. People tweaked their daily lives to conserve water, like taking shorter showers or turning off the tap when brushing their teeth. More controversially, Perdue made an official drought declaration and imposed strict restrictions on how much and when people could water their lawns. Along with the recession, the watering ban pummeled one of the state's largest industries, so-called urban agriculture, which includes turf grass and landscaping, leading to layoffs and bankruptcies. This time, the $8-billion-a-year industry was spared what Georgia Agribusiness Council President Bryan Tolar calls the “knee-jerk reaction” of the watering ban.
Tolar's got it right. When a state is more than half in drought, suggesting that maybe everyone cut back on water use is a knee-jerk response. Similarly, when you are on fire, people are far too quick to stop, drop, and roll.
It is much easier to stick your head in the sand when your state has been dried into dust.
The Order: 1886. This article is part of a series called Shut Up, Videogames , in which critic Ed Smith invites games old and new to pipe down, or otherwise. In this edition, he looks at the genre defying third-person action-adventure,
It's no masterpiece — it's the story of immortal knights fighting werewolves and vampires in Steampunk London. But The Order: 1886 (2015) is still more than videogame critics deserve. Its low review scores and petulant detractors are proof, once again, that games could never become art (whatever that would mean) because the people playing them and the people responsible for curating them simply wouldn't allow it. Verily, no-one who reviewed The Order during its launch last year had a bloody clue. From complaining about its length, its closed, straightforward levels and its unwillingness to let the player explore, critics recited the same handful of complaints they throw at every game they can't be bothered to consider. Even the praise levelled at The Order — “great atmosphere,” “solid gunplay,” “creative weapon design” — was recycled air. It's a sorry state when a game as uninterested in tradition and form as The Order can only be viewed through the antique framework of magazine videogame review. And when critics have grown so smug and apathetic that only brazen, moist-eyed complaisance like Everybody's Gone to the Rapture (2015) can get them to think — even for a second — about what they're saying.
The Order cannot only be viewed through the antique framework of magazine videogame review
There are so many fantastic moments in The Order: 1886 . The one-on-one knife fight with the alpha werewolf. Standing over the airship ballroom, identifying assassins disguised as guards via the discrepancies on their counterfeit uniforms. Igraine is a fantastic character. The ending, considerably more muted and sober compared to what could have been, is a rare example in the gaming industry of restraint and sombreness over spectacle—not that the game struggles with spectacle. Ready At Dawn Studios, quite rightly, picked up an award from the Visual Effects Society , and I can see why. Where so many games conflate visual lustre with colors, wide open spaces and fantastical expression, Ready at Dawn is fascinated by cold, old interiors. I've spent a lot of my life inside English churches, and the great halls at country estates, and the same woody smell and fragile silence that hangs heavy in those places permeates The Order , especially during scenes around the Knight's roundtable.
At times, The Order lapses into rote third-person shooter or horror game style but largely I'm impressed and relieved with how defiant it remains throughout, refusing to emulate the many other games based around guns and monsters. I've never played anything like The Order: 1886 . And I don't mean in the dumb, false Saints Row way — this isn't a sandbox game where every wacky, supposedly idiosyncratic idea has been researched and focus tested, and is remarkable only to the kind of people who think the Joker from The Dark Knight (2008) is a complicated character. I've bemoaned in this article the use of clichés, so forgive me in advance, but The Order is a true original. Videogames are often created to slot neatly into genres — shooter, horror, “interactive story.” But like its antagonistic Hybrids, The Order refutes easy classification. That wilful lack of straight identity meant, essentially, it was too complicated for game critics, not the individuals, mind you — they're smart people — but the field in which they work.
Individuality and videogames are a square peg and a round hole. We credit work to studios. We judge all games by the same or similar criteria. We refer to artists with the dehumanizing titles “developer” and “designer,” or even worse, “dev.” The lack of diversity in the videogame industry is visible from space, but beyond precluding women, gay people, and people of color, there's a surreptitious effort, smuggled through customs under the rubrics of consumer friendly or matter-of-fact writing to homogenize and compartmentalize videogames. Everything must have a term and a place. Everything must fit at least some of our pre-existing notions about what games are or should be. So when a game joyfully undermines the conventions of so many genres, a game like The Order , which cannot be easily separated out or discussed like one would discuss a household appliance, it goes misunderstood and forgotten.
Peter Hore is an Australian-born man best known for public stunts such as disrupting the 1997 Melbourne Cup by running onto the track during the race, interrupting a tennis match at the Australian Open, and gate-crashing celebrity funerals.[1][2]
During a World Cup football qualifying match between the national teams of Australia and Iran in 1997, Hore ran onto the field and cut the Iranian team's net.[3][4] According to ESPN FC, the resulting delay was a turning point in the match, allowing the Iranian team to "regain their composure" and go on to win.[5]
In 2007, Hore publicly told Queensland premier Anna Bligh that he would run for her seat in South Brisbane the following year.[2] He ran against Kevin Rudd as an independent in the Division of Griffith in 2007, polling over 2,200 primary votes as "P.M. Howard".[6]

The spectacle surrounding Greg Hardy's domestic violence arrest mushroomed Wednesday, with his girlfriend claiming in court records that the Carolina Panthers star defensive end threw her on a couch covered in firearms and threatened to shoot her if she told anyone about their fight.
Wednesday afternoon, Panthers fans and a national audience began listening to a series of 911 tapes connected to the case. In one, a heavily breathing Hardy describes girlfriend Nicole Holder as out of control, intoxicated and trying to attack him with the heel of her shoe.
“Like, yo, she's out of it, my man,” Hardy tells the 911 operator. “And she will not stop coming at me, bro.”

In another call, apparently made from the security desk of Hardy's building, a woman who claims to have attended the gathering in the player's condo yells that a woman had been beaten there for more than 30 minutes.
“We need the police here now before this girl gets seriously hurt. Now!” she said.
Wednesday morning in a Mecklenburg County courtroom, District Court Judge Becky Thorne Tin said Holder's injuries and the nature of the allegations against Hardy “raise concerns” about Holder's safety.
The Pro Bowl lineman was arrested Tuesday on misdemeanor charges of assaulting a female and communicating threats. He was released on $17,000 bond.
Hardy, 25, trading in his orange inmate jumpsuit for sunglasses, a black tank top and Panther sweatpants, did not talk to reporters waiting outside the jail. His attorney, Chris Fialko of Charlotte, says the charges against his client are unfounded.
A league source said the Panthers, who are scheduled to pay Hardy $13.1 million for the coming season, met with the player and his agent, Drew Rosenhaus, on Wednesday to discuss the arrest. Rosenhaus, who attended Hardy's court hearing, declined comment as he left the courthouse.
Earlier that day, while Hardy was still in jail, his team dealt with the irony of hosting a domestic violence awareness rally in the very stadium in which Hardy has starred.
Arrest warrants accuse the 6-foot-4, 290-pound Hardy of throwing the 24-year-old Holder to the floor and into a bathtub, slamming her against a futon and “strangling” her during an argument at his home.
Hardy also said he would kill her, the warrant stated, a threat “made in a manner and under circumstances which would cause a reasonable person to believe that the threat was likely to be carried out.”
Fialko, however, told Tin that Holder attacked Hardy and his friend and assistant, Sammy Curtis, and that his client called 911 when Holder refused to leave his home.
He said that after the fight, Holder called Curtis more than a dozen times Tuesday trying to reach the player.
The dueling versions of events don't explain what ignited the predawn confrontation.
But in a complaint accompanying her request for a restraining order against Hardy, Holder added compelling details to her version of the fight. They include allegations that an enraged Hardy choked her with both hands and threatened to kill her.
At one point during their struggle, she said in her complaint that Hardy picked her up and threw her into a tub, then dragged her across the floor by her hair. As Hardy screamed threats, Holder said he lifted her over his head and threw her on a couch “covered in assault rifles and/or shotguns.”
She said Hardy keeps a cache of 25-30 “AK-47s, automatic-looking weapons, shotguns, rifles and pistols” in his North Tryon condo and a former residence.
Holder said Hardy threatened to shoot her if “I went to the media or reported his assaults to anyone,” according to her complaint.
“I begged them to let me go and I wouldn't tell anyone what he did,” she wrote. “They took me out into the hall, pushed me down and went back inside his apartment.”
When police arrived, Holder said she met them while crawling to the elevator.
Champagne then AA
Alcohol may have been a factor in the fight, which broke out during an early morning “after party” at Hardy's uptown residence.
Tin noted that both Hardy and Holder were intoxicated when police arrived.
An Instagram post by Curtis appears to show that Hardy spent part of Monday night at Bubble, a champagne lounge and nightclub in the EpiCentre, the uptown complex where Holder works as a waitress. The club is about two blocks from Hardy's residence.
In February 2013, Holder was convicted of DWI. Her license was suspended and she was fined $100 plus court costs, and ordered to serve 20 hours' community service.
During Hardy's bond hearing, Judge Tin ordered the NFL player to attend three Alcoholics Anonymous meetings each week until his next court date on June 27.
She then warned Hardy not to have any contact with Holder, even if she called.
“Do you understand?” the judge asked Hardy, who stood with his hands clasped behind him.
“Yes, ma'am,” he responded quietly.
Weapons at home
Holder did not attend the hearing, but she appeared in the corridor outside the courtroom afterward with a woman later identified as a sister. She was wearing a dress, large sunglasses and had her arm in a sling. Her attorney, Stephen Goodwin of Matthews, said Holder was “torn up” about the incident and was in no condition to talk.
He said Holder had been injured “head to toe” and had gone to the emergency room afterward. Her worst injury, he said, had been to an elbow.
“My client was not the aggressor by a long shot,” Goodwin said after the hearing. “She weighs less than 120 pounds. ... It was a fight. He threw her around the room.”
Even before his first known arrest, Hardy's off-the-field behavior already has troubled the Panthers, who are in the midst of deciding whether to offer the player tens of millions of dollars over a multiyear contract.
Carolina selected him in the 2010 draft after Hardy fell down other teams' draft boards because of questions about his character. At the University of Mississippi, he was suspended for missing team meetings and violating team rules.
Now, his legal problems could grow. On Thursday afternoon, a judge will hear Holder's request for a restraining order. She wants Hardy barred from her home, from the EpiCentre where she works, and from her parents' residence in an adjoining county.
She also wants the courts to block Hardy from buying more weapons and seize the ones he has.
North Carolina law requires permits for handgun purchases, which are good for five years. Buyers can obtain up to three permits with a single application. Each permit is good for one handgun or up to five long guns.
In her complaint, Holder says some of Hardy's guns have permits and some do not.
Police did not mention any guns in their report or on the arrest warrants. A department spokesman did not respond to an emailed question on whether police will be investigating the claims about Hardy's weapons. Staff researcher Maria David contributed.
Fibromyalgia Treatments: Use & Benefits
Wondering what other fibromyalgia patients use to treat their symptoms and how they rate these therapies? Emma K. Guymer, M.D. looked at key symptom ratings, frequency of other associated conditions, and use of various treatments in 150 fibro patients in Australia.*
The evaluated patients were referred by Melbourne physicians to a local rheumatology clinic between March 2008 and September 2010. No one was pre-selected based on symptoms or treatments because the study goal was to look at factors in a community sample of people with fibromyalgia.
Out of 150 patients, 63% met the strict tender point criteria (i.e., they had at least 11 of the 18 specified tender points), while the remaining study participants were diagnosed with fibro based on symptoms. The latter method is common practice by many physicians who recognize the widespread pain of fibromyalgia and its associated symptoms. Both approaches are described in our website section on diagnosis.
As expected, patients meeting the tender point criteria had higher ratings for pain, fatigue and trouble sleeping, as well as a greater number of associated conditions. Among all 150 patients the average number of associated conditions was five. The two most common were chronic headaches and irritable bowel syndrome, as shown below.
“A higher number of associated conditions in this group of patients was correlated with a longer duration of symptoms, worse pain, and a higher illness impact,” states Guymer. Why more associated conditions were found in patients with a longer illness duration was not addressed.
Study participants' average age was 47 and duration of fibro was 10 years. Guymer found that the younger a patient's age, the more serious they rated their fatigue. She suggests that may be because “younger people expect to have higher than usual energy levels in keeping with their peers.” This implies older patients are more apt to attribute fatigue to aging, which could be a false assumption.
What about the use of various treatments and their rated benefits? At the time of the study, low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (such as amitriptyline), Cymbalta, and Lyrica were available in Australia, although not specifically approved for treating fibromyalgia. Guymer's research report emphasizes that these three medications have “evidence of significant benefit in the management of fibromyalgia.” But as it turned out, these meds did not live up to expectations.
Only 35% of the patients were taking the medications Guymer described as “evidence-based.” Perhaps the low usage of these meds was due to their poor performance. The only benefit obtained from them was a slight improvement in physical function, but they did not reduce the key symptoms of pain, fatigue, or disrupted sleep.
Psychological approaches to pain management had been tried by 30% of the 150 fibro patients, but did not produce improvements. “Complementary or alternative therapies were being used regularly at least once a month for the past three months by almost half of the patients,” says Guymer. Examples included naturopathy, osteopathy, physical therapy, massage, acupuncture, chiropractic treatment, and movement therapies such as tai chi. These treatments provided a significant decrease in anxiety.
Patients engaged in regular aerobic exercise at least 20 minutes twice per week (44%) had reduced illness impact scores, better physical function, and less fatigue, anxiety and depression. Whereas patients who were less likely to exercise had a greater number of other associated conditions and higher scores for pain, fatigue, and sleep disruption. It's difficult to know whether those who exercised were just more able to do so.
Staying fit is an important goal for maintaining overall health and function for anyone, with fibro or not. Surprisingly, milder movement therapies, such as tai chi and yoga, were not considered forms of exercise in this study despite reports showing they help fibromyalgia patients maintain function.
Exercise and certain medications (tricyclic antidepressants, Cymbalta and Lyrica) are all touted to improve the pain of fibromyalgia, yet this study failed to substantiate these claims. Guymer and her colleagues did not point this out in the article, but the data was clear about lack of pain relief. One could only guess this omission is somehow related to the consultation fees received by the authors from the makers of Cymbalta and Lyrica (Eli Lilly and Pfizer).

Being overweight boosts the risk of dying from diabetes and kidney disease but not cancer or heart disease, and carrying some extra pounds actually appears to protect against a host of other causes of death, federal researchers reported yesterday.
The counterintuitive findings, based on a detailed analysis of decades of government data about more than 39,000 Americans, supports the conclusions of a study the same group did two years ago that suggested the dangers of being overweight may be less dire than experts thought.
"The take-home message is that the relationship between fat and mortality is more complicated than we tend to think," said Katherine M. Flegal, a senior research scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who led the study. "It's not a cookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all situation, where excess weight just increases your mortality risk for any and all causes of death."
The study, published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was greeted with sharply mixed reactions. Some praised it for providing persuasive evidence that the dangers of fat have been overblown.
"What this tells us is the hazards have been very much exaggerated," said Steven N. Blair, a professor of exercise science, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of South Carolina. "It's just not as big a problem as people have said."
But others dismissed the findings as fundamentally flawed, saying an overwhelming body of evidence has documented the risks of being either overweight or obese.
"It's just rubbish," said Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health. "It's just ludicrous to say there is no increased risk of mortality from being overweight. . . . From a health standpoint, it's definitely undesirable to be overweight."
The proportion of flabby Americans has been rising steadily, and two-thirds are now classified as overweight, including about one-third who carry so many extra pounds that they qualify as obese. The trend has triggered widespread warnings of an impending epidemic of diabetes, heart, disease, cancer and other ailments.
Flegal and her colleagues raised the possibility two years ago that being overweight was less risky than feared. Their analysis of data from decades of federal surveys concluded that people who were overweight -- but not obese -- had lower overall mortality rates than those of normal weight. But their study came under heavy criticism.
In the new research, the team sought to confirm and expand on the original findings, examining additional data from later surveys and parsing individual causes of death across a range of weights. The analysis is based on the best health statistics that federal scientists collected between 1971 and 2004, including cause-of-death data from 2.3 million adults from 2004.
The researchers used widely accepted federal definitions of "overweight" and "obesity" based on body mass index. A BMI of between 25 to 30 classifies someone as overweight and above 30 as obese. For example, a 5-foot-4-inch adult is considered overweight at 146 pounds and obese at 175.
The researchers calculated that in 2004, obesity was associated with as many as 112,000 excess deaths from heart disease and more than 45,000 deaths from diabetes and kidney disease. Obesity was not, however, associated with an overall excess in cancer deaths, though it was linked to as many as 19,000 excess deaths from malignancies commonly blamed on fat, including breast, uterine, ovarian, kidney, colon, esophageal and pancreatic cancer.
The most surprising finding was that being overweight but not obese was associated only with excess mortality from diabetes and kidney disease -- not from cancer or heart disease. Moreover, the researchers found an apparent protective effect against all other causes of death, such as tuberculosis, emphysema, pneumonia, Alzheimer's disease and injuries. An association between excess weight and nearly 16,000 deaths from diabetes and kidney disease was overshadowed by a reduction of as many as 133,000 deaths from all other deaths unrelated to cancer or heart disease. Even moderately obese people appeared less likely to die of those causes.
Although the study did not examine why being overweight might guard against dying from some diseases, Flegal said other research has suggested that extra heft might supply the body with vital reserves to draw upon to fight illness and aid recovery.
"You may not just have more fat. You may also have more lean mass -- more bone and muscle," Flegal said. "If you are in an adverse situation, that could be good for you."
The findings are consistent with other research, others said.
"This doesn't surprise me," said Glenn A. Gaesser, a professor of exercise physiology at the University of Virginia. "I think we've overstated the case that being overweight is something that poses a great health hazard."
Willett and others, however, said the study was too small to fully account for factors such as smoking and preexisting illnesses that could skew the findings. Being overweight, they said, not only increases the risk of dying from many major diseases but also has other negative consequences.
"I think it would be very unfortunate if these findings made us complacent about becoming overweight," said JoAnn E. Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. "We know being overweight is linked to increased incidence of major chronic disease, including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease," she said, adding that it "impairs physical function and decreases quality of life."
In fact, another paper published in the same journal found that obesity is increasing disabilities among the elderly, making them less able to do simple things such as walk a quarter-mile, climb 10 steps, bend over or lift 10 pounds.
Flegal stressed that the findings should not encourage people to be overweight or change any public health recommendations.
"This doesn't mean being overweight is good for you," Flegal said. "But it is associated with less mortality than expected."
We were disappointed to read this weekend's piece on GMO crops in the New York Times (“Doubts About the Promised Bounty of Genetically Modified Crops”). The reporter chose to cherry-pick data to argue that GMOs have failed to provide significant benefits, especially yield increases, to farmers in the United States. The reporter's arguments were misinformed– and overlooked the perspectives of millions of farmers in the United States, India, South America and elsewhere in the world, who have chosen to plant GMOs over the past two decades.
We were especially disappointed because we engaged with this reporter on multiple occasions over several months to provide interviews, background information and recommendations of third-party experts and resources. Much of this context was omitted from the article. As a result, the article may create unfortunate confusion and concern among consumers who are unfamiliar with modern agricultural practices.
As we told the reporter on multiple occasions, analyzing yield trends across geographies is complex because agronomic characteristics, maturity rates and other factors have to be taken into consideration. Making comparisons across very broad geographies – such as the United States and Europe – is especially difficult. Focusing on a comparison between smaller regions allows for better control of those variables and a more accurate comparison.
For instance, in a new analysis on the Huffington Post, Monsanto's Chief Technology Officer, Dr. Robb Fraley, analyzes yield trends between the Canadian province of Ontario and the country of France. These two regions are agronomically similar. The big difference? GMOs are common in Ontario but not used in France. From 1997 to 2015, corn yields increased in Ontario by 51 percent, while French yields only grew about 10.5 percent.
Importantly, while this increase is significant, yield improvement is only one of the many benefits GMOs offer to modern agriculture. Let's look more broadly at those benefits.
The article completely overlooked the benefits of GMOs for farmers in the developing world – an area where this new technology is truly changing lives, particularly when it comes to food security. According to Qaim and Kouser (2013), access to insect-resistant GMO cotton in India has increased family incomes and improved calorie consumption significantly. Indeed, because of access to GMOs, food insecurity among Indian cotton-producing households has fallen by 15 to 20 percent.
GMOs and other modern agricultural tools have also helped accelerate the adoption of practices such as conservation tillage and no-till, which helps increase carbon sequestration in soil. Brookes and Barfoot (2016) calculated that in 2014 alone, conservation tillage enabled by glyphosate-tolerant GMO corn and soybean removed 22.4 billion kilograms of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. That's the equivalent of taking 10 million cars off the road for a year. That benefit alone should make headlines.
The article also made misleading claims regarding the use of pesticides on GMOs. Brookes and Barfoot also report that GMOs have reduced pesticide spraying from 1996 to 2015 by 8.2 percent.
In addition, despite the article's alarmist language about pesticide safety, it is important to note that all pesticides registered for use in the United States have undergone rigorous health and safety evaluations by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These assessments ensure that pesticides can be used safely according to their label instructions, whether they are being used on GMOs, conventional or organic crops.
It's easy for anyone to cherry-pick numbers to make a misleading argument. But it's impossible to argue with the real-world benefits both large and smallholder farmers have seen around the world.
As a company, we are committed to delivering new tools and innovations to growers to help nourish our world in a more sustainable way. We believe GMOs are one important tool, among many, that will help feed our growing world. We invite readers of the Times piece to dig deeper than the headlines and explore the benefits of GMOs for themselves. A great place to start is at the Conversation or GMOAnswers.com.
Here's a running list of links to responses by farmers, academics and others who are providing accurate information and setting the record straight on misinformation in the article as well.

Steven Gerrard believes the Premier League are on red alert after Liverpool FC maintained their title challenge.
Brendan Rodgers' side leapfrogged Arsenal into second place and are only four points behind leaders Chelsea after an emphatic 3-0 win at Southampton.
Luis Suarez scored his 24th goal of the season before creating the second for substitute Raheem Sterling and earning the penalty from which Gerrard netted during injury time.
And skipper Gerrard said: “I think we have sent out a message.
“Arsenal lost and we won, and I'm sure there are now plenty of people in the Premier League looking out for us.
“We have no Europe, so we are fresh going into every game.
“All we asked for at the start of the season was to be in there with 10 games to go. We are certainly in it.
“We are not the favourites, Chelsea and Manchester City are the favourites. We just need to keep going.
“If we keep winning then the belief is going to grow. It's important to stay calm and take each game as it comes.
“Yes we don't have the experience, but we have a lot of good things going for us.
“The challenge now is can we put in a good performance at Old Trafford in our next game and see where we are with four or five games to go.”
Liverpool have taken 23 points from the last 27 and scored at least three goals in their last four top-flight games.
And asked if a championship triumph was possible, Gerrard responded: “Why not?”
* Southampton 0 Liverpool 3: Reds go second as Kopites start to dream
With the Reds having lost their last two meetings with Southampton, Rodgers sprung a surprise by employing a midfield diamond and pushing both Suarez and Daniel Sturridge up front.
“Credit has to go to the manager,” said Gerrard. “He had his tactics spot on.
“We got it wrong here last year and we got it wrong against Southampton at the start of the season.
“But a sign of a good side is when you learn from your mistakes. It was difficult at times in the first half, but we were solid defensively and always a threat on the counter.
“Our idea was to play a bit longer and try to beat their press, and leave two up top. If you want to play two versus two against Suarez and Sturridge, all the best.”
Between them, Suarez and Sturridge have now scored 42 Premier League goals – only one less than the whole of the Manchester United team.

Rodgers, though, was equally pleased with the performance of his defence who kept only their third clean sheet on the road in the league this season – and helped ensure Liverpool's biggest-ever win at Southampton.
“We had an outstanding performance, a really significant performance to keep a clean sheet, score three and maybe score another three or four more,” said the Reds boss.
“Defensively we were outstanding. We pressed the ball well, and in terms of our defensive performance that was right up there with the win against Arsenal.
“This is a difficult place to come to. We probably surprised Southampton by playing a diamond in midfield. The players showed great concentration and got their rewards.”
Rodgers again played down any talk of ending a championship drought that stretches back to 1990, but added: “It's great for the supporters to dream.
“They have seen the evolution of this team over the last 18 months.
“We have been consistently progressing over the last year. We stay calm and don't be carried away.
“I'm not focusing on the title. I'm focusing on winning the next game.
“We will stay calm. We have 10 games to go and want to continue working at the same level.”

A flagship railway station being constructed on the outskirts of Edinburgh has been extensively damaged after a break-in.
Edinburgh Gateway is a £41m project intended to complete a vital link with Edinburgh's trams and improve access to the airport.
British Transport Police said it was broken into between 19:30 and 21:00 on Saturday.
Buildings under construction, vehicles and machinery were damaged.

Insp Lindsay Clarkson said: "The station was broken into last night and extensive damage was caused to vehicles, machinery and the buildings in the station. Windows were also smashed and graffiti daubed all over.
"BTP takes criminal damage the rail network extremely seriously. It is nothing more than selfish vandalism that makes people fearful of their surroundings and costs the railway industry thousands of pounds to clean up.
"Unfortunately the costs associated with the clear up and fixing the damage caused is ultimately covered by the fare-paying passenger, which is not acceptable."
Donald Trump wanted to be the trade president, the jobs president, the “America First” president. Now, less than three months into the White House, he is a president wading into a civil war in Syria with no end in sight and no clear pro-America parties on any side of the years-long conflict.
Trump faced his first crossroads as commander in chief this week — whether to stand by as Syrian President Bashar Assad gassed his own people to death or intervene militarily in a humanitarian tragedy in exactly the way he argued against before he was president. And unlike in his career as a businessman developer, walking away from two bad choices was not an option.
Story Continued Below
He chose to intercede, ordering Thursday's strike on a Syrian air base that American officials say was used by the Assad regime to launch sarin gas attacks against civilians. In response, Russia announced on Friday that it would boost Syria's air defenses in response to the American airstrike, a move that will cloud Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's first official visit to Moscow, planned for next week.
The move risks the wrath of Trump's nationalist base, which is opposed to foreign military entanglements. It also threatens to open an international crisis for an administration that has struggled to advance domestic priorities amid constant infighting among top lieutenants and fellow Republicans in Congress.
One person close to the White House questioned the timing of Trump's action, which came in the middle of his much-anticipated two-day summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, billed as an opportunity to focus on America's trade deficit, an issue Trump has spoken passionately about for decades.
“You have the second-biggest economic world leader sitting in your home and you're going to overshadow him?” the person close to the White House said of the timing. “It's a amateur hour.”
Dennis Wilder, who served from 2015 to 2016 as the CIA's deputy assistant director for East Asia and the Pacific, echoed that sentiment: “Missiles fly while Xi is feted. It makes Trump look strong but embarrasses Xi.”
The White House tried to paint Trump's Syria strike as rising to a presidential moment. On Friday morning, the administration released a photograph of Trump, in his red power tie, being briefed on the airstrikes at Mar-a-Lago surrounded by advisers. It was reminiscent of the famous 2011 photo of President Barack Obama in the Situation Room watching the raid in which Osama Bin Laden was killed.
But if that image was meant to project competence and confidence, it came after days of vacillation over how the administration would handle Assad, whose grip on power White House press secretary Sean Spicer said just last week was “a political reality that we have to accept.”
Aboard Air Force One on Thursday, Trump said, “He's there, and I guess he's running things, so I guess something should happen.” Hours later, dozens of American Tomahawk missiles rained down on the Assad-controlled Syrian air base, near Homs.
Trump notably invoked “God” three times in his three-minute address about the bombings he ordered. It was a marked shift for a politician who in 2015 and 2016 mostly eschewed religious terminology except when he was wooing evangelical voters.
“No child of God should ever suffer such horror,” Trump said of the gas attacks, asking later “for God's wisdom” in his response. But it was Trump's final reference to God that was most telling. “God bless America and the entire world,” he said, offering a universal twist on the phrase American presidents have used for decades to close national speeches.
Some in the White House pitched the Syria strike as a limited move and not one that suggested Trump is lurching in a more interventionist direction, advocated by hawks like Republican Sen. John McCain. “I would not in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy or our posture relative to our military activities in Syria,” Tillerson said.
Still, the administration embraced the language of internationalism and America as the world's most important actor, if not chief enforcer. “It's important that some action be taken on behalf of the international community to make clear that these chemical weapons continue to be a violation of international norms,” Tillerson added.
That is a far cry from the economic nationalism that has been advocated by Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who has been engaged ing a series of power struggles from the start of the administration, first with chief of staff Reince Priebus and more recently with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, and Kushner's allies, including advisers Gary Cohn and Dina Powell.
Trump's core supporters strained to reconcile the militarized images of bombs landing thousands of miles away overnight with the America First rhetoric they embraced.
“I'm officially OFF the Trump train,” tweeted Paul Joseph Watson, an editor at the reliably pro-Trump site InfoWars.
“Missiles flying. [Marco] Rubio's happy. [John] McCain ecstatic. Hillary's on board. A complete policy change in 48 hrs,” tweeted Laura Ingraham, the talk radio host and a prominent Trump backer who spoke at the Republican National Convention.
Mike Cernovich, a pro-Trump blogger who has trafficked in fake news but whom the White House has also boosted in recent weeks, pushed the hashtag #NoMoreWars. “Push back,” he wrote, “it's what honest people do.”

Trump's decision to intervene marks a clear break from his pre-presidential rhetoric.
In 2013, Trump had urged Obama “do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside” in one tweet. In another all-caps missive, Trump wrote, “FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA – IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.”
By October 2016, Trump mostly complained about how “our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad,” as he put it in one debate. On the campaign trail, Trump suggested working in concert with Russia to defeat the Islamic State, the most powerful force in Syria besides Assad. “I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS,” Trump said at another debate against Clinton.
Democrats have hammered the president for hypocrisy after he lamented how “beautiful babies were cruelly murdered,” as Trump said Thursday night, while he has demonized Syrian refugees and pushed to block Syrian children from coming to America as refugees with his executive orders.
Yet, with Russia discussing strengthening Assad's defenses, it is not clear how an impulsive and emotional president who takes poorly to any perceived slight will respond. He already cast the decision to strike Syria as driven, in part, by the emotion of seeing children writhing to death from sarin.
“A big impact on me — big impact,” Trump said at the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday. “That was a horrible, horrible thing. And I've been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn't get any worse than that.”

Melissa Thomas, 24, was charged with revenge porn but walked free from court in Manchester today
A jilted mistress who sent a naked video of her lover to his wife after he started a legal battle to prove he was the father of their lovechild has walked free from court today.
Melissa Thomas, 24, sent the video of her 63-year-old ex-lover in the shower to his wife in a WhatsApp message, threatening to show it to social services.
Her ex-lover, who had left her in 2014 after discovering she was pregnant, had patched things up with his wife and recently launched a bid to get a DNA test through the courts to prove that he was the father.
Thomas, from Salford, admitted disclosing private sexual photographs and films to the wife with intent to cause distress.
But she denied a further charge of sending the clip to her former lover, who also received the footage on Facebook.
And today at Manchester Magistrates' Court, she walked free after a district judge said that she had been spared jail because she was the main carer for their son.
She was handed a 12-week suspended prison sentence and she was ordered to pay £100 compensation to the victim's wife, as well as a victim surcharge of £115 and court costs of £85.
In a statement read to the court the man - a father of two - said: 'I'm disgusted that a person could act in this way. I have done everything I can to see my son, I pay child support I have taken him on holiday and this is what I get in return. I no longer wish to be in contact with Melissa and will sort out contact through the courts.'
The court heard how Thomas sent the footage to her ex-lover's wife with the message: 'When you phone social services, why don't you show them what your husband sent me. Good luck, you'll need it when I'm finished.'
Earlier, the man, who has not been named for legal reasons, also received the two-year-old clip on Facebook. It came along with the caption: 'I just found this video on Facebook with your name and contact attached you perv. How can you threaten a young boy? Is your wife committing benefit fraud?'
Fearing the footage was being circulated on the internet, he showed the messages and the 2014 video to his wife, who reported Thomas to the police.
Prosecutor Kate Gaskell said Thomas began her affair in September 2013 when she met her lover through a friend of his wife's daughter.She said: 'The relationship continued until October 2014. In September of that year he found out the defendant was pregnant. That relationship had finished and his wife had left him but they had got back together and the child was born in July 2015.
'There was no contact between them from November 2014 to March 2015 when Melissa found out that he was going to court to get DNA testing relating to the child. There were difficulties relating to the child with access and child support which carried on between the two.
Melissa Thomas, 24, sent the video of her 63-year-old ex-lover in the shower to his wife in a WhatsApp message, threatening to show it to social services
'He wanted to see the child but this was made difficult for him because of the defendant. On the 29 of August 2016 he recieved a WhatsApp message. It was a video clip of him which lasted approximately 13 seconds, of him in the shower, fully naked front facing which was taken on a Caravan Holiday in June 2014.
'The video was taken by another female but was taken with his knowledge and he was aware of that. The defendant and another female had taken the video while away at a Golden Sands caravan park - and the video was taken with his consent at that time.
'The messages that came with the video were "I just found this video on Facebook with your name and contact attached you perv. How can you threaten a young boy'. 'Is your wife committing benefit fraud". There then followed another photograph of the child sat between his bare legs.
11-MONTH HATE CAMPAIGN AGAINST HER FORMER LOVER The incident came three years after Thomas, a former tourism student, was caught vandalising another ex-lover's garden in an 11-month hate campaign. She had initially falsely accused the victim of assaulting her then was said to have created a Facebook page in his name so she could post abusive messages to her own account - and pretend they came from him. As a result of the lies, the man was arrested four times, wrongly charged with common assault and spent a total of 30 hours in a police cell before police found evidence which backed up his denials. In March 2013 Thomas was given a two year suspended prison term.
'He showed the messages and the video to his wife and was worried that the video was being circulated on the internet and he was in a panic.'
The man's wife took his phone to a local police station but when she returned home, she received messages including the clip to her own device via WhatsApp from a phone belonging to Thomas.
Miss Rogers said: 'The messages said 'When you phone social services why don't you shout them what your husband sent me. Good luck, you'll need it when I'm finished'. The lady said she felt that the messages were degrading and outrageous messages.
'She said that it brought back thoughts of the affair and she has worried the defendant has other sexually explicit videos from the time of the affair that she could use to threaten them, and is worried that the videos will end up on a pornographic website.
'She does not want people in the area seeing and talking about the video and approaching them about it. There is no evidence of the video being posted on social media. The video itself is a full frontal naked shot where he is identifiable. He said it was a highly embarrassing personal video sent without his permission.'
Thomas later admitted sending the video to the man's wife because she 'didn't like them'. She claimed she had 'no desire to cause any distress to those she sent it to - adding that she herself had been a victim of revenge porn and that had 'personally made her mentally unwell and that she understands the distress caused and how they feel.'
Defence lawyer Suzanne Ludlow said: 'Miss Thomas admits that she knew her actions would cause harm and she admitted that with a prompt guilty plea. It is a rather unusual set of circumstances.
Today at Manchester Magistrates' Court (pictured), she walked free after a district judge said that she had been spared jail because she was the main carer for their son
'The pair were in a relationship and his wife was fully aware that they had an affair.
'The issue was between Thomas and [the victim] over their son and this had come to a head when she sent this message.
'She admits that she should not have sent that message and should have backed down rather than what she did do and she deeply regrets it.
'Thomas accepts that she should not have done what she did. She has not only put herself in a risky position but also her son.
'When she sent the messages she was not thinking properly.
'She has not had an easy life or the best upbringing and that is how she got into a relationship with [the victim]. She now has a stable address and her main priority is her son.
'She is very aware of the seriousness of these offences and she really regrets sending that message. It was a silly and stupid thing to do which has put her liberty at risk.'
District Judge John Temperley said: 'Miss Thomas, in your favour are the following factors.
'Your early guilty plea, the remorse you have shown for this case and significantly the fact that this video did not go any further than the wife.
'Had that been the case it would have had a much more serious effect than it has.
'Nevertheless people still go to prison for this kind of offences.
'However, you are the sole carer of your son and if you were to lose your liberty he would suffer.'
COLUMBIA, S.C. — In the autumn of 2007, Tim Tebow came to this town to deliver a crushing blow. Then the Florida Gators' dynamic quarterback, Tebow cemented his destiny as that year's Heisman Trophy winner by accounting for seven touchdowns against the University of South Carolina Gamecocks.
Sitting in the stands in Williams-Brice Stadium that day, and watching glumly, was the Honorable Stephen K. Benjamin, who at that point was still three years away from being elected mayor here. At the end of Tebow's display, Benjamin remembered having one thought: He was glad that Tebow was leaving town and hoped he was gone for good.
Now, a decade later, Mayor Benjamin is thrilled to welcome Tebow back.
“We are so glad he is finally on our side,” Benjamin said. “It's a heck of a story.”

Joshua Crowther writes,
In just 24 hours Super: Issue Three is the most overfunded comic in Kickstarter history. In just one day it hit it's goal and is now 16833% funded. Okay…so the goal was only for $3, but since the last Kickstarter wasn't successful, I took the time to think about what the most important goal of any writer: To get their book into as many hands as possible. All writers, famous or lamentably obscure, are cursed with a crushing desire to take random words, try to organize them into a logical sequence, and then get anybody and everybody to look at them.
“So,” I realized, “I already paid for the art. If only one person wants this book, and I need to print just one copy, how much money will it really take?” The answer was $3. Luckily, it seems, more than one person wants the book, and now if you want one too, you are guaranteed a copy by backing the Kickstarter.
What's the comic about? Well, if you've ever seen the TV show, Batman '66…it's basically nothing like that at all. Not even a little. It's basically about a young man with quite literally the most common superpowers: flight, invulnerability, super-strength. Think Thor, Superman, Martian Manhunter, Nova, etc. The catch is that he lives in the real world. That means no super villains, no alien invasions, or spandex suits. The goal is to create the most realistic “superhero” comic of all time. It won't boil down to some super-powered fist fight at the climax, foiling nefarious plans and thus conclude the plot. (Something that even films with similar ideas, such as Chronicle, have always end up doing.) This is a comic that questions if a super powered individual could save the world from the real travesties we see on the news: war, poverty, and starvation.
What would really happen? How would people react?
In addition to being the most overfunded Kickstarter of all time, it may also be the fastest. While most Kickstarters keep you waiting for months (sometimes even over a year) for your book. Super: Issue 3 gives you instant access to digital copies the moment you pledge. For physical copies, you could be receiving them within two weeks or fewer.
If you'd like to jump on this historic Kickstarter, once again, you can go here. Hell, you can even just go there to download the whole first issue for free.

I moved and a LOT of things have come up. For a short while, I thought my previous neighbors had stolen my package. But, to my surprise, the post office had kindly held onto it for me and I received it yesterday! First of all, cuteness overload. Everything was wrapped so cute and the card was BADASS!I SERIOUSLY almost pissed myself when I opened up the Naked Basics palette. I have wanted it for months and with having a baby on the way, I couldn't afford it at the time. It means so much. The man and I are in love with the salt water taffy from Maine. It's the best I have EVER had! The whole box smelled wonderful from the candy and the mini Yankee Candles, too! I also adored the little bottle of maple syrup. So cute! You did a wonderful job selecting my gifts. Especially at a time when I really could have used a good friend. From the personalized card, you really made me feel like I had a friend sitting next to me opening up the box. YOU ARE AWESOME! Maybe it's just the pregnancy hormones, but I cried at how thoughtful and just plain AWESOME this gift was. Thanks a million!
Taken in total, it's clear — for Mr. Lamar, there's nowhere to turn for trust, safety, peace.
And so on “DAMN.” he's biting back, something that begins before the music even starts. The album and song titles are rendered in caps, with a period at the end. Defiant, controlled jabs. Exclamations without exclamation points. Mr. Lamar peers out from the album cover, focused and wary.
That continues on this sometimes boisterous, sometimes swampy, rarely fanciful album — it's Mr. Lamar's version of the creeping paranoia that has become de rigueur for midcareer Drake.
And yet this is likely Mr. Lamar's most jubilant album, the one in which his rhymes are the least tangled — on several songs, he returns to the same phrase, for emphasis — and his stories here are the most pointed. On “FEEL.,” he's watching his carefully stacked walls of protection begin to crumble:
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been faking
I feel like the feelings are changing
Feel like my daughter compromised and jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
He trudges a similar path on “PRIDE.,” which begins with a harrowingly beautiful intro by Steve Lacy, of the group the Internet, which Mr. Lamar follows with a low, groaning flow as he details the misery of doubt:
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in men
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make amend
Mr. Lamar's belief in music may well be the only faith left unshaken here. His songs limn classic Los Angeles gangster rap, but also that city's kinetically inventive progressive independent scene of the early-to-mid-1990s. He sprinkles in a couple of gestures to classic hip-hop, including a callback to the signature clipped cadence from Juvenile's “Ha” on “ELEMENT.,” and the recurrent use of the celebrated New York mixtape DJ Kid Capri, whose excited yelps are peppered throughout. Mr. Lamar also recruits high-profile guests: There's a smooth collaboration with Rihanna, “LOYALTY.,” and “XXX,” which features some reassuringly understated singing by Bono, of U2.
“DAMN.” is also a bit of an exhalation after a few years of high-intensity balancing of social and aesthetic concerns. On “ELEMENT.” Mr. Lamar reinforces that his concerns are interior, especially coming off his last album, “To Pimp a Butterfly” from 2015, which became a flash point for black political awareness and activism. “Last LP I tried to lift the black artists,” he raps here, “But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists.”
And taunting — an underappreciated Kendrick Lamar skill — is the core of “HUMBLE.,” one of the album's most fiery songs: “I don't fabricate it, most of y'all be fakin'/ I stay modest 'bout it, she elaborate it/This that Grey Poupon, that Evian” It's an approach he returns to often here, more than his usual knotty parables.

First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter.
Why Trump won the debate without even showing up
DES MOINES, IA -- Earlier this week, we wrote that Donald Trump's decision not to attend Thursday's GOP debate could be a brilliant tactical move -- or a disastrous one. Well, after watching the two hours of debate last night, it was clearly the former. Why? We can count three reasons:
His closest competition had a bad night: The man who's his closest competition in Iowa, Ted Cruz, had maybe his worst debate performance of the cycle. And a lot of it was due to the fact that he -- not Trump -- was the candidate with the target on his back. Marco Rubio went after Cruz, hard. So did Rand Paul. But it was Cruz who also did himself no favors by trying to win an interruption contest with co-moderator Chris Wallace (and lost) and who attacked the moderators' questions like he did at the CNBC debate (but was booed in the process). Cruz got his taste of being the frontrunner, and he struggled. The Des Moines Register's front page sums it up: “Rough Night for Cruz.”
He got to skip Fox's brutal video montage: Trump also won by not showing up because he avoided getting the same kind of brutal video montage that Fox News showed first on Rubio (with his past statements vowing to fight amnesty and an earned path to legalization -- before backing the Gang of Eight immigration bills), and then on Cruz (on supporting immigration reform and a path to legal status). It was evidence to Iowa conservatives that NO ONE is going to get to Trump's right on the issue of immigration.
And he got to sit on his lead in Iowa with three days to go: Given it all, Trump got to protect his lead in Iowa and in the other early contests. Now it's still possible that Trump could lose Iowa – due to turnout -- but it won't be because of last night's debate. When you think about it, what we all thought was Trump's gamble turned into the safest move for someone with the lead.
Trump's own bizarre counter-programing event
Meanwhile, NBC's Ali Vitali has the dispatch on the event where Trump DID show up. “The buzz for Trump's counter-debate programming was huge. The news out of the event, however, was less so. A packed auditorium of about 700 at Drake University listened to Trump speak — but Trump spoke for less time than veterans and fellow politicians that joined him on stage. In fact, he wasn't the only 2016 Republican candidate to speak behind the ‘Trump' branded podium. Former Sen. Rick Santorum and former Gov. Mike Huckabee both joined Trump after appearing at the Fox undercard debate -- but it wasn't politics that brought them there, they said. Instead, it was to support the veterans. Still, it was a somewhat bizarre sight to see former Iowa caucus winners and current candidates alike speaking behind a podium emblazoned with the frontrunner's name on it. Santorum chose to counter that weirdness by standing off to the side of the podium, to avoid a bad shot. Huckabee on the other hand accepted it. ‘I figure you're gonna get the photo anyway, I might as well just stand here and be done with it,' he said with a laugh.”
Imagining what the GOP race would have looked like without Trump
As our colleague Alex Moe observed, last night's debate was a reminder of what the GOP race MIGHT have looked like if Trump hadn't run for president. Strikingly, Jeb Bush had his strongest debate of the cycle (just compare and contrast his showdown with Rubio on immigration last night vs. the showdown over Rubio's Senate voting record in October's CNBC debate). Rand Paul wasn't far behind. In fact, we have to agree with the take that Trump's candidacy hurt these two men more than any others in the GOP field. We already mentioned Cruz' rough night. But Rubio also has his struggles. Yes, he stood out -- in a good way -- during the first half of the debate. Yet when the conversation turned to immigration, especially the video montage, Rubio had to play defense on what has been his biggest vulnerability in this race. So the good news for Cruz was that, despite his own struggles, Rubio also got pounded from the right and left (from Jeb) on immigration.
Handicapping Rubio
The Rubio plotline has become a fascinating story. Does he surprise with a strong third place in Iowa (as our NBC/WSJ/Marist poll showed from yesterday) -- or even somehow finish in second? Or does he lag in the low double digits?
Another reason why Iowa is important for Clinton
A win prevents a big cash drain over the months ahead: As Hillary Clinton has attended fundraisers in last 48 hours in Philadelphia and New York, they're a reminder why she needs to win Iowa. If Bernie Sanders ends up carrying both Iowa and New Hampshire, he's going to create a real cash drain for Team Clinton, especially since Sanders raises his money over the internet, while Clinton raises much of hers at big-money fundraisers.
Sanders stumps with Cornel West -- maybe the biggest Obama critic from the left
In Iowa tonight, Bernie Sanders will campaign with academic Cornel West in Davenport and Dubuque. But as the Democratic race has turned into a contest over who is Obama's true heir -- Candidate Obama from '08 (Sanders), President Obama from 2009-2016 (Clinton) – West's appearance with Sanders is another reminder how complicated Sanders' relationship with Obama is. Here are some quotes from West on Obama, per the Washington Post's Jonathan Capehart:
West has called Obama “a Republican, a Rockefeller Republican in blackface.”
He also called Obama “a black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs and a black puppet of corporate plutocrats.”
And he said this about the president: “I think my dear brother Barack Obama has a certain fear of free black men,” West said. “It's understandable. As a young brother who grows up in a white context, brilliant African father, he's always had to fear being a white man with black skin. All he has known culturally is white.”
On the trail
Donald Trump holds a rally in Nashua, NH at 10:00 am ET, while everyone else is in Iowa… Hillary Clinton has events in Des Moines, Dubuque, and Davenport… Bill Clinton hits Fairfield, Muscatine, and joins his wife in Davenport… Ted Cruz makes five stops in the Hawkeye State… Marco Rubio holds four… Jeb Bush also is in Iowa, hitting Carroll, Sioux City and Sioux Center… John Kasich, Chris Christie, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina also are in Hawkeye State… And ditto Bernie Sanders, who hits Mount Pleasant, Washington, Muscatine, Davenport (with Cornel West), and Dubuque (with West again)
Countdown to Iowa: 3 days
Countdown to New Hampshire: 11 days

[Author] me <tom.wimmenhove () gmail com> [Description of the vulnerability] The rolling code used by the keyfob and car is predictable in the sense that it is not random. It is simply incremental. [Impact] An attacker can 'clone' the keyfob and, unlock cars and, when increasing the rolling code with a sufficiently high value, effectively render the user's keyfob unusable. [Affected vehicles] The exploit has only been tested on a 2009 Subaru Forester, but the same fob is used, and the exploit should work on, the following vehicles: - 2006 Subaru Baja - 2005 - 2010 Subaru Forester - 2004 - 2011 Subaru Impreza - 2005 - 2010 Subaru Legacy - 2005 - 2010 Subaru Outback [Solution] Don't use the most predictable sequential type of rolling code. Don't send the command twice so that, in case of Samy Kamkar's rolljam attack, not even the XOR checksum has to be recalculated when changing a lock to an unlock command, since the 2 commands cancel each other out, leaving the checksum in tact.

Alheio à folia momesca, me valho do noticiário de alguns jornais e da internet para concluir que o Japonês da Federal não fez muito sucesso na folia de rua. Pelo menos no Rio de Janeiro. Por aqui, máscaras reproduzindo seu rosto parecem não ter agradado. Poucas foram vistas. Menos mal.
O japonês da federal, na verdade, só ganhou notoriedade por conta de o Departamento de Polícia Federal (DPF), através da Superintendência Regional do Paraná (SR/DPF/PR) ou da própria direção geral em Brasília, ter permitido sua excessiva aparição nas operações da Lava Jato. Foi uma estratégia – e aí vem a dúvida de qual o objetivo – ou um simples e repetido erro?
O fato de um agente condenado por corrupção, cuja expulsão do DPF foi revertida por uma questão técnica e não pela prova de sua inocência, tornar-se o rosto dos federais nas operações gerou desconforto interno entre seus colegas.
De tanto aparecer nas fotos das 22 fases da Operação Lava Jato escoltando presos, Newton Hidenori Ishii, 60 anos, virou o retrato do Departamento de Polícia Federal (DPF) na Operação Lava Jato para a população. Mais curioso ainda é a propaganda que aparece no Facebook relacionando o Ministério Público Federal e o juiz Sérgio Moro (acima) com a campanha do abaixo-assinado para propor ao Congresso um projeto de iniciativa popular com mudanças nas leis de combate à corrupção. Ali, junto ao juiz Moro e ao procurador Deltan Dallagnol – apontados como os dois principais paladinos da moralidade e honestidade no país – quem aparece ao lado não é nenhum delegado da Força Tarefa, mas o agente Ishii, que apenas escolta presos. Pior ainda, um condenado por corrupção. Ao que parece, falta coerência.
Essa excessiva exposição vem irritando seus colegas do DPF, inclusive e notoriamente, delegados. Entre estes, os que participam diretamente da Força Tarefa (FT) no Paraná. Uma delas*, no Facebook, comentou sobre o fato de serem representados por alguém que não compõe a FT:
“Por isso eu desisto…. Chega de virar noite (…) Ao menos se fosse um dos colegas que trabalham de fato”.
As críticas nas páginas dos delegados nas redes sociais, repetiram-se em diversos momentos. Eles consideram não ser o agente a pessoa adequada para representá-los junto à população. Criticaram, de forma um tanto quanto preconceituosa, até o fato dele provavelmente não ser articulado como deveria: “talvez não formule um frase com correção, é surreal” (sic). Acham que faltou à instituição escalar alguém gabaritado para representá-la:
“A ausência de um rosto nosso (seja qual razão for), fez a imprensa dar à PF o rosto de um “escoltador”. É patético…”,
resumiu um delegado do norte do país, um dos mais indignados com a situação e que mais comentários postou. Outro colega seu, lotado em Brasília, foi mais direto ao relembrar o passado do Ishii que Luis Fernando Veríssimo, em artigo irônico, intitulou de “Japonês Bonzinho”;
“Na verdade, o agente deveria era ter ido pra rua (…) Ter como rosto da PF alguém que foi demitido por praticar crime é uma tragédia”. CORREÇÃO DO BLOG: Erroneamente, na legenda da ilustração acima, afirmávamos se tratava de uma página do MPF no Facebook. Erramos. O MPF do Paraná não tem página no Facebook. Trata-se de páginas de apoio à campanha, sem responsabilidade da instituição propriamente dita. Pedimos desculpas a todos os membros do MPF e ao leitores de um modo em geral.
O passado de Ishii, policial federal desde 1974 quando passou no concurso e que conta os dias para aposentar-se em maio, tem manchas. O processo que responde por corrupção, formação de quadrilha e facilitação de contrabando e descaminho, ainda não transitou em julgado. O Recurso Extraordinário que tanto o Ministério Público Federal como os réus condenados ingressaram no Superior Tribunal de Justiça (STJ), dormita no gabinete do ministro Félix Fischer, desde abril de 2015, a espera do julgamento.
Como Odebrecht, dúvida nas transcrições – O japonês ainda responde a uma Ação Civil Pública iniciada em junho de 2008. Com muitos réus entre policiais federais e auditores da Receita Federal, atravessadores e contrabandistas – eram mais de 40 inicialmente – o processo está em um ritmo lento, ainda na fase do depoimento de testemunhas. que a se encontra no interrogatório das testemunhas. Mas, curiosamente, nela, o agente Ishii e sua defesa levantaram a mesma dúvida dos advogados de Marcelo Odebrecht na ação que este responde na Operação Lava Jato: a transcrição das gravações não foi fiel.
Sua expulsão pelo Processo Administrativo Disciplinar (PAD), e, 2009, acabou anulada por decisão do STJ, em 2014. Àquela altura, delitos administrativos já tinham prescrito, inviabilizando um novo procedimento. Ishii briga na Justiça para reaver os valores que deixou de receber após ser demitido.
Disputado por partidos políticos – Mesmo sem condenação transitada em julgado, o agente japonês, teoricamente, não pode ser considerado um “ficha limpa”. Afinal, seu processo já passou pela segunda instância. O Tribunal Regional Federal da 4ª Região (TRF-4) ao julgar a Apelação Criminal impetrada pelos réus, reduziu sua pena. Mas, manteve a condenação.
Tal situação poderá prejudicar os planos que alguns políticos nutrem de lança-lo candidato. Como comentou uma delegada de São Paulo. Ao defender maior participação dos delegados na mídia, revelou sua conversa com um deputado federal:
“Vocês tem toda razão …. ! Precisamos reforçar o papel do Delegado na mídia. Falei com um deputado federal conhecido e ele me contou que vários partidos disputam a tapa o japonês da federal para candidatura em seus partidos. Fiquei chocada!!!”
Prontamente seu colega respondeu:
“Um agente que agora é disputado a tapa pelos partidos.“
E foi complementado pela colega da Força Tarefa:
“E ganha até para senador no Paraná.”
O colega do norte do pais ironizou:
“O azar dele é que as eleições, agora, são municipais, rs (…)
Mas, ao comentar o posicionamento da colega de São Paulo, ele assumiu a parcela de responsabilidade, só não ficou claro se com relação ao papel dos delegados ou com relação à candidatura do agente:
“Não tenho dúvidas. Este é o nosso país. E, acredite, não somos inocentes nisso tudo. Temos culpa. To-dos nós.“
Passando o carnaval em casa, cuidando da filha que contraiu uma virose, o agente japonês garante que não está nos seus planos ingressar na carreira política. “Não tem nada a ver. Não sei porque ficam falando estas coisas. Na realidade eu estou entrando em férias“. Mas, não será o primeiro se depois de negar se deixar morder pela mosca azul. Hoje, insiste, uma candidatura não faz parte dos seus planos: “Nem penso nisso. Não é minha pretensão. Vou trabalhar, me aposentar e vou para casa”.
Tucanos se apropriando – Ishi pode estar até sendo sincero ao dizer que não tem pretensões políticas, mas já está fazendo o jogo político. e sendo aproveitado politicamente. Basta ver as páginas do Facebook do jornalista e marqueteiro cibernético Sérgio Kobayashi. Tucano assumido, com passagens pelo governo de José Serra, na prefeitura de São Paulo, de Geraldo Alckimil, no governo do estado paulista e com Gilberto Kassab na prefeitura paulistana, hoje preside a RTVE – Rádio e TV Educativa do Paraná.
Com Alckimin, ocupou a Fundação do Desenvolvimento Escolar (FDE) e a verba que deveria ser prioritariamente usada na construção de escolas, pagava assinatura de jornais e revistas.
Bastou encontrar-se com Ishii nos 60 anos da E-TV do Paraná, em dezembro, para registrar o fato em um selfie e em seguida badalar o japonês em sua página do Facebook, sempre com críticas ao PT, Dilma e Lula, como tornou-se habitual em se tratando de Kobayashi. Desde então, sua página é alimentada por fotos e charges em que o agente federal do Paraná sempre aparece prendendo ou ameaçando algum petista.
Comunicação Social na berlinda – O japonês da federal diz desconhecer as críticas dos delegado – “nem tenho Facebook, como vou ficar sabendo” – e garante que não foi transferido de posto, como noticiado recentemente. “Não sei de onde retiraram isso. Continuo na mesma função, só estou saindo de férias. A gente riu para caramba dessa notícia, de que eu tinha saído. O meu chefe, o superintendente também não sabia, o direto-geral também não sabia e tampouco eu“.
Sua colega do Paraná responsabilizou a imprensa e o próprio DPF pelo fato de Ishii tornar-se hoje simbolo da instituição:”Não há uma política institucional de valorização do nosso trabalho, a mídia pega aquilo que aparece, e quem é escolhido pra as escoltas de presos famosos certamente aparece, a opção é da Administração” (…)
Nisso, o delegado do norte do país, complementou:
“A ADPF precisa sepultar a IN (Instrução Normativa) da mordaça, ainda que seja na justiça. Embora precisemos ter critérios, ela inibe a atuação junto à imprensa. Precisa ser reformuladas”
A crítica acabou caindo em um setor do DPF que sempre teve dificuldades internas: a Comunicação Social. Normalmente, seus responsáveis, ficam entre o mar e o rochedo e, não raro, apanham dos dois lados, pois nem sempre a política da direção do órgão é de transparência. Em governos passados, era bem pior, quando a Comunicação Social só divulgava o que interessava e escondia os erros encontrados. Bons tempos da dupla François Renne e Bruno Craesmeyer, que não brigavam com notícia e nem desprezavam jornalistas.
Hoje, as sindicâncias abertas a partir da Lava Jato para investigar vazamentos, escutas clandestinas e outras irregularidades, são um exemplo direto. À imprensa não se repassa o que realmente ocorre. Daí surgem as informações em off (sem a fonte aparecer). A crítica à Comunicação Social, também surgiu no Facebook dos delegados, no texto que reproduzimos ao lado.
A questão é que os delegados, no relacionamento com a imprensa trabalham de forma dissimulada. Seja pelas proibições internas – a Instrução Normativa que, oficialmente, impede o contato com jornalistas sem autorização superior -, mas também por um jogo de interesse. Quando vazam informações, principalmente para detonar suspeitos, transformando-os em réus antes mesmo de concluírem as investigações, na verdade fazem um jogo político. Em alguns casos, como na Lava Jato, nitidamente partidário, contra o governo e o PT. Em outros, pesam os interesses internos na corporação ou a vontade de aparecer e ficar bem com os jornalistas,.
Não raro, no dia-a-dia, há uma gama grande de delegados que sequer acompanham as investigações par e passo. São agentes, mais experientes e traquejados, que por estarem à frente dos caso, colhendo informações na rua ou mesmo no cruzamento de dados, detêm as informações relevantes e se tornam alvo dos jornalistas. Nestes casos, os vazamentos sempre serão em segredo, pois os APFs não podem se pronunciar, salvo em raras exceções.
O que fica nítido é que a figura do Japonês da Federal na Lava Jato criou mal estar até mesmo fora do DPF, como narraram alguns delegados:
“Colegas, sem emitir juízo de valor, informo que recebi, inclusive de fora da PF, mensagens demonstrando preocupação com a exposição excessiva na mídia do APF da SR/PR, conhecido como “JAPONÊS DA FEDERAL”, e que poderia, em tese, criar transtornos para ele próprio, para a PF, e para a investigação realizada no IPL da Lava Jato”,
advertiu um deles, do Rio de Janeiro, sendo complementado por outro de Brasília:
“Um colega da PC/RJ (Polícia Civil do Rio) trouxe a seguinte novidade, que aponta para a necessidade de providências urgentes; Ele (o japonês) precisa urgentemente ser removido dos holofotes. Não se trata de fazer nada contra ele. Apenas de retirá-lo das prisões importantes, promovendo um rodízio entre os agentes que a executam para evitar que sejam criadas celebridades que surfarão na onda da Lava Jato.”
Dentro e fora da Polícia Federal já há quem perceba que a super exposição do agente que já foi condenado pode trazer problemas à instituição e à própria Operação Lava Jato, no minimo suscitando desconfianças. Resta saber o que a Direção Geral do DPF busca atingir mantendo-o na linha de frente. Só pode ser o descrédito de todo o trabalho, afinal, o simbolo da Polícia Federal na operação que se propõe a acabar com a corrupção no país é alguém condenado justamente por corrupção. Falta coerência.
*Como o interesse do blog é apenas noticiar fatos, sem gerar problema aos servidores federais que, ao fazerem suas crítica à administração do DPF, exercem um direito, deixamos de identificá-los publicamente. Situação diversa de quando atacaram autoridades, inclusive, a presidente Dilma Rousseff, o que fere a legislação que regulamenta o deveres dos Policiais Federais.
Ted Cruz went head to head with a Trump supporter outside a restaurant in Marion, Indiana, confronting the man over the front-runner's violence while seeking his support.

“If I were Donald Trump, I wouldn't have come over and talk to you, I wouldn't have shown you that respect in fact, you know what I would have done, I would have told the folks over there go over and punch those guys in the face. That's what Donald does to protesters…In fact he say's I'll pay your legal fees if you punch him in the face”
“You're lying like you always do,” said the Trump supporter.
Cruz continued to explain why he felt Trump was an incompetent candidate before the supporter interrupted “Indiana doesn't want you.”
Cruz responded: “a question that everyone here should ask do you want your kids repeating the words of Donald Trump? Would you be proud if your kids came home cursing and yelling and insulting?”

Welcome to Toronto or what the cool kids call it, #the6ix! Toronto regularly ranks high on “Best City in the World” lists and has the second, yes the SECOND coolest neighborhood in the ENTIRE world. So I'm not being biased when I say Toronto is my favorite place in the entire world and I hope after this weekend you at least understand why a lot of people agree with me. One of the best things about Toronto is its young and vibrant food scene. Toronto isn't world renowned for its food… yet. However in the past 10 years or so the food scene has grown into what I would argue is one of the best in North America and is a hidden gem in the foodie world.
Due to Toronto's multicultural nature, again ranking near the top if not the top in the world, there are so many different choices of cuisine in Toronto. This is by no means an extensive list as there are so many options in the city but all the choices are either walking distance or a cheap Uber ride away from the venue.
Late Night Eats 24hr Joints
Toronto for the most part is not a 24hr city but there are a few decent diner style options to eat at if you are looking for dinner after a 9th round loss.
Thompson Diner
http://www.thompsondiner.com/
A little pricey for what it is but it's the closest decent 24 hr spot to the venue. Some of you may have even booked a room in the Thompson hotel above the restaurant. It's also close to a lot of pubs and bars and clubs so if your plan is to go out drinking on one of the nights this is one of the better choices pre or post drinking binge.
What to order: It's hard to pinpoint a must order at a diner but poutine is always a good choice. No sane person dislikes poutine.
The Lakeview
http://www.thelakeviewrestaurant.ca/
This is my go-to place for afterhours eating. It's decently priced and has a lot of great sandwiches and various fried things, even fried chocolate bars!
What to order: If you want to go really indulgent get a Pie Milkshake. If they have apple pie that's my go-to shake.
Honorable mention:
Zets
http://zets.ca/
Zets is great Greek diner style food. Some people swear by it but it really isn't worth the trip that far from the venue unless you head there before your flight as it is very close to the airport.
Fast food alternatives
If you want a meal around the price of McDonald's but you are aware that Mcdonald's is a horrible option, these are for you.
The Burger's Priest
Burger's Priest is the burger chain that started the whole burger craze that's been going on in Toronto over the past few years. BP is a basically a copycat of Shake Shack that has matured and come into its own identity. Some in Toronto may say another place has a better burger but no one can argue that BP is one of the top choices for a burger in Toronto.
What to order: I like to keep it simple with The Priest, but The Vatican is just as good as it sounds. Don't bother with fries. Here's a link to the secret menu if you are into stuff like that http://www.theburgerspriest.com/secret-menu/.
Bahn Mi Boys
http://www.banhmiboys.com/
I love Bahn Mi. I've ate too many to count but surprisingly I wouldn't suggest going to Bahn Mi Boys for a Bahn Mi. They are great there but their tacos and baos are just as good and much easier to eat. There are two locations and both are walking distance to great MTG stores.
What to order: I love me a Squid taco but whatever you order you have to share a kimchi fries with someone. It's covered in pulled pork, kimchi and other goodness. It's basically their version of a poutine. If you are alone the kimchi fries is good enough to eat by itself or you can get a taco or bao as well if you are really hungry.
Poutine
Toronto isn't really a poutine city, but most Americans that travel to Canada want to try our national dish so I am obligated to give you some suggestions.
Poutini's House of Poutine
http://www.poutini.com/
One of the two places I'll go to if I feel for a poutine. A quick Uber from the venue.
What to order: Bacon Poutine. Tastes as good as it sounds.
Smoke's Poutinerie
https://smokespoutinerie.com/
The other place I'd go to if I was feeling for a poutine. Lots of locations for this chain.
What to order: Bacon Poutine. Tastes as good as it sounds.
Dinner
Bestellen
http://www.bestellen.ca/
Toronto is sometimes known as hogtown due to its history in the meat packing industry. There are a lot of meat and pork options in the city but Bestellen is one of the best. If you only have one splurge dinner during your trip to Toronto this HAS to be it.
What to order: If you have 8+ friends you HAVE to get the whole roasted suckling pig. It's an amazing experience, extremely filling and well worth the money. Minimum 8 people, $60 per head which includes apps, a whole suckling pig, sides and dessert. Be sure to book 72 hours in advance.
Copacabana/Copa by the Sea
http://www.thecopa.ca/
All-you-can-eat Brazillian Steak house. I haven't ate at Fogo before but I'd imagine this is very very similar. If you like seafood, the “by the sea” location is great. I ate there when it first opened and had A LOT of scallops.
Wvrst
http://www.wvrst.com/
It's basically a bar that has great selection of beers and ciders as well as an extensive selection of sausages. Lots of room, but on busy nights the wait can be long if you go during dinner and night time drinking hours.
What to order: Duck fat fries. I don't suggest getting the dirty version. If you like truffles, upgrade to the truffle mushroom mayo.
Oddsoeul
http://www.blogto.com/restaurants/oddseoul-toronto
Probably one of my favorite restaurants. Korean food is just good food. Full of flavor and always makes an impact. Oddsoeul goes the fusion route with great success. It is reasonably priced versus some places and the food is super tasty.
What to order: If they have the pork neck I would definitely get it. Sometimes it's not available. Basically like a huge order of ribs for around $20-$25. One order can feed 2 easily, possibly more.
Imanishi
http://www.imanishi.ca/
New Japanese izakaya that made Toronto Life's Best New Restaurants of 2016 list. I've only eaten here once but I am sure I will make many more trips to their restaurant.
What to order: Corn tempura. I've never seen this offered anywhere else so I can confidently say that this is the best corn tempura I have ever had.
Brunch
Brunch is by far the best option to make your trip worth it if you scrubbed out and didn't make day 2. It's also a great option if you drank a little too much Saturday night.
School
http://www.schooltoronto.com/
This place is a little pricey but servings are decent, it's super close to the venue and the food are just good. If you got an Airbnb in Liberty Village, which hopefully you did as it's the closest and probably the cheapest option to stay for the GP, you are in luck because School is in the Liberty Village neighborhood.
What to order: Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast. By this point I think you can tell that I like pork, especially bacon. I also love the combination of sweet and salty which this dish does effortlessly.
Saving Grace
http://www.blogto.com/restaurants/savinggrace
A quaint little place with a very cozy feel. I don't know much about the chef/owner but it feels like it is family owned. You really feel the love put into the food. There can be a wait to get in on weekdays so if you plan to go on the weekend definitely be prepared to wait.
What to order: Espressado milkshake. It's an avocado milkshake with an espresso shot. If you have never had an avocado milkshake this is your chance to change that. I'm an Asian so I grew up drinking avocado milkshakes and other sweet avocado concoctions but as I grew older I realized the rest of the world views avocado only as a savory ingredient. Get it together people!
Dessert
If it's warm enough to eat ice cream there are a few spots for you to try and if you want to live like a true Torontonian, then it is ALWAYS warm enough to eat ice cream.
Sweet Jesus
http://www.sweetjesus4life.com/
Way over the top soft serve. Worth the price even just for the Instagram pic opportunity. Check out the pics on their website so you know what you are getting into.
What to order: the S'more latte is on point if you don't feel like ice cream otherwise pick your poison, nothing is a bad choice.
BangBang
http://www.bangbangicecream.com/
Great ice cream with insanely on point flavors. They produce small batches so the flavor options are always different. There is usually one or two savory options as well if you want an interesting taste adventure. They even have an anchovy and seaweed topping option.
What to order: I would actually stay away from the cookie sandwich option. If you want more than just ice cream go for the cinnamon roll sandwich option with whatever flavor you think will go well with it. It's a new feature and it's amazing. Also, there is currently a Mango Pudding with warm coconut sticky rice available and it is the truth.
Glory Hole Doughnuts
http://www.gloryholedoughnuts.com/
I know this isn't an ice cream spot and I know that doughnuts aren't traditionally a dessert but it's worth a trip to Glory Hole if you want something sweet. There are a lot of gourmet cupcake joints around the city but there are very few gourmet doughnut options but even if there were Glory Hole would still be on the top of the list. Yeasty style doughnuts and Cake style doughnuts are on the menu depending on the flavor. Their yeast ones are my favorite but I'm biased to that type of doughnut.
What to order: Toast and Butter is my favorite but if you make the trip get a half dozen or a dozen and try a bunch with some friends. You won't be sorry.

Fourth time lucky for Julian Barnes, who wins the Man Booker prize 2011 for his novel The Sense of an Ending after missing out on three previous occasions
Julian Barnes finally won the literary prize that has eluded him on three previous occasions when he was tonight presented with the Man Booker prize for his short novel, The Sense of an Ending.
His victory came after one of the most bitter and vituperative run-ups to the prize in living memory - not among the shortlisted writers, but from dismayed and bemused commentators who accused judges of putting populism above genuine quality.
But few of those critics could claim Barnes' novel is not of the highest quality. The chair of this year's judges, former MI5 director general Stella Rimington, said it had "the markings of a classic of English Literature. It is exquisitely written, subtly plotted and reveals new depths with each reading."
Much of the row over the shortlist has stemmed from Rimington's own prioritisation of "readability" in the judging criteria. But tonight, she said quality had always been just as important.
"It is a very readable book, if I may use that word, but readable not only once but twice and even three times," she said. "It is incredibly concentrated. Crammed into this short space is a great deal of information which you don't get out of a first read."
Accepting the prize, Barnes thanked the judges for their wisdom and the sponsors for their cheque. He also offered some advice to publishers: "Those of you who have seen my book, whatever you think of its contents, will probably agree it is a beautiful object. And if the physical book, as we've come to call it, is to resist the challenge of the ebook, it has to look like something worth buying, worth keeping."
Afterwards Barnes admitted a sense of relief at finally winning. "I didn't want to go to my grave and get a Beryl," he said referring to Bainbridge, who was shortlisted five times, never won and received a posthumous Best of Beryl Booker prize.
He said the "readability" row had been "a false hare" to which he had paid little attention, adding: "Most great books are readable. Any shortlist of the last ten years that I've read has contained nothing but what you would call readable books."
Barnes once called the prize "posh bingo" and he said he had not changed his view – it simply depended on whom the judges were and what they liked. "The Booker prize has a tendency to drive people a bit mad," he said, not the least writers with "hope and lust and greed and expectation" so the best way to stay sane, he said, was by treating it as a lottery until you win "when you realise that the judges are the wisest heads in literary Christendom". Asked what he would spend the £50,000 prize money on he said a new watch strap was first on his list. "I could buy a whole new watch."
The book, at 150 pages, is undoubtedly short, but not the shortest to ever win the prize – that record belongs to Penelope Fitzgerald's Offshore, which won in 1979 and is shorter by a few hundred words.
The Sense of an Ending, Barnes' 11th novel, explores memory: how fuzzy it can be and how we amend the past to suit our own wellbeing. It tells the story through the apparently insignificant and dull life of arts administrator Tony Webster.
"One of the things that the book does is talk about the human kind," said Rimington. "None of us really knows who we are. We present ourselves in all sorts of ways, but maybe the ways we present ourselves are not how we really are."
Rimington said the question of whether Barnes was overdue to win the £50,000 prize never entered her mind or figured in the debate. "We really were, and I know you find it very boring of me to say so, looking at the books that we had in front of us," she said.
Despite the sometimes hostile reaction to the shortlist, Rimington said she had enjoyed the process of judging. "I've been through many crises at one time or another in which this one pales, I must say. We've been very interested by the discussion. We've followed it sometimes with great glee and amusement. The fact that it has been in the headlines is very gratifying."
It took the judges (Rimington, MP Chris Mullin, author Susan Hill, the Daily Telegraph's head of books Gaby Wood and the former Spectator editor Matthew d'Ancona) just 31 minutes to decide on the winner, after what Rimington called "an interesting debate." They had been divided 3-2 at the beginning of the judging meeting, but were all agreed by the end.
"There was no blood on the carpet, nobody went off in a huff and we all ended up firm friends and happy with the result," she said.
Barnes, 65, had been shortlisted for the prize three times previously; in 1984 with Flaubert's Parrot, when he lost out to Anita Brookner; win 1998 with England, England, losing to Ian McEwan; and with Arthur & George in 2005, when he lost to John Banville.
What was particularly striking this year was that Barnes was the only seriously big hitter on the shortlist, and the only author to have been shortlisted previously.
The others on the shortlist were Carol Birch for her much-admired Jamrach's Menagerie, a historical high seas adventure; two Canadian writers - Patrick deWitt for The Sisters Brothers, a picaresque western, and Esi Edugyan for Half Blood Blues, which mixes the raw beauty of jazz and the terror of Nazism; and two debut novels – Stephen Kelman for Pigeon English, which tells the story of a Ghanaian boy who turns detective on a south London housing estate; and AD Miller for Snowdrops, a Moscow-set tale of corruption and moral decline.
The shortlist undoubtedly prompted a livelier debate about what makes a great novel with many commentators annoyed by judge Chris Mullin's belief that a book had to "zip along" to be worthy of being considered. Last year's Booker chairman Andrew Motion also weighed in, accusing the judges of creating a "false divde" between what is high end and what is readable, and questioning the absence of authors such as Alan Hollinghurst, Edward St Aubyn and Ali Smith.
The row has also led to a group of writers, publishers and agents announcing plans to set up a rival literary prize that would reward the artistic achievement of a writer above 'readability.'
Full details of the Literature Prize have yet to be announced but the agent Andrew Kidd said they felt "a space has opened for a new prize which is unequivocally about excellence." However, not everyone condemned the shortlist. Book sellers, in particular, were happy with a list that resulted in record Booker sales. A spokesman for Waterstones, Jon Howell, called the critical reaction "ungracious sniping" and said Barnes was a worthy winner.
If anyone is upset at the win, it may well be the bookies. William Hill said more than half of all bets had been for Barnes, a 6/4 favourite.
• This article was amended on 19 October 2011. The original described Matthew d'Ancona as editor of the Spectator. This has been corrected to former editor.
Judged on nothing other than things I hear from my friends and Internet buddies, it seemed to me like many more people were paying attention to D.C. United this season, if for no other reason than the presence of Charlie Davies. Judged on television ratings, my impression would seem to be correct.
Last year's wretched United side averaged just a 0.14 rating through five games on Comcast SportsNet, while this year's up-and-down club has averaged a 0.62 rating in the D.C. market, which equals an increase of 340 percent. United hasn't had a higher average rating through five games since 2005, when United was coming off its fourth MLS Cup.
Now, the 0.62 number is still extremely modest — that's about 15,000 households in this market. But to give just one comparison, in the 2007-08 season, the Caps averaged a 0.57 rating in this market. That was the first playoff year, when people started talking about Rock The Red and all that.
And of these five broadcasts, four have been on Saturdays, which isn't necessarily a hot day for ratings.
The growth has been even more dramatic among key demographics, with ratings up 495 percent among 18-49-year old men and up 435 percent among 25-54-year old men.
The top-rated game was opener against Columbus, which earned a 0.90 rating, good for about 22,000 households.
Incidentally, The Post's ombudsman dropped this bombshell over the weekend, in a column about sports coverage in the print edition.
The Post's proprietary internal studies show that women as well as men are more interested in men's pro teams and men's sports generally than they are in women's teams or women's sports, and by large margins. Among women and men, interest in the Redskins and football ranks first — way out front — followed by the Capitals, Nationals, Ravens, Wizards and Orioles. The Mystics, D.C.'s women's pro basketball team, are next, with D.C. United close behind.
The Mystics ahead of United? The Ravens ahead of the Wizards? The Nats ahead of anyone? These are strange, strange numbers to me. I hope to find out more about this soon.
Friday night, the Washington Capitals lost to the Florida Panthers. It was the second meeting between the two teams this season, with the Capitals winning the other match-up 3-2 (SO) in early November at Verizon Center.
During the third period of Friday's game, as Panthers forward Krys Barch dumped the puck into the Capitals zone, CSN's Craig Laughlin had a question for play-by-play man Joe Beninati.
“Didn't Barch pull out his tooth in the first meeting… in the penalty box?” Laughlin asked.
“Yeah, I was never sure if he did that for real or if it was all a big joke,” Beninati responded with a laugh.
The whole conversation can be heard here.
There was no consensus on what exactly happened that night. Many people, including me, believed they saw a tooth fly into the stands on video. The NHL — with all the resources and connections in the world — called it a joke and labeled their video, Krystofer Barch pretends to throw tooth. The day after the incident, The Today Show aired video of the incident and claimed it was a fake-out too.
But with Joe B and Locker wanting answers, I was compelled to spring into action. I put on my fedora, got out my giant cordless phone, and did some digging. Here's what I found out.
Saturday, November 2nd started like any other day for Richmond-native Cale Watson — well, except for one difference. After getting through a week of work at his job at a retail music distribution company, the 28-year-old was geeked-out to be making the two-hour drive up to Verizon Center to see the Capitals play again.
Watson, who described himself as an avid hockey player to me in a recent phone interview, has been going to Caps games since he was eight-years-old. This game was especially exciting for him because the tickets he bought were directly behind the Panthers penalty box.
“Just by the seats, I knew it was going to be a fun game,” Watson said. “But because of the Barch incident, it was a night I'll never forget.”
After conducting three separate interviews with people seated by the penalty box at the game that night and examining video and photo evidence, I can now conclusively end the debate on what happened that night.
With the Panthers down a few goals in the third period, Barch, Florida's enforcer, came onto the ice and tried to bring energy to his beleaguered team. Unfortunately, that backfired when he took a run at Steve Oleksy in the Caps defensive zone. An aware Oleksy stuck out his hip, and flipped Barch into the air. The Panthers forward landed head first onto the ice, his mouth making contact with the playing surface.
After Oleksy skated away, Barch — bleeding and in a rage — skated towards the benches and tries to stir things up even more, desperately trying to get someone on the Capitals to fight.
Eventually Barch would be the only player sent to the penalty box, receiving two minutes for charging Alexander Urbom. He was not happy about it.
“You could barely hear what he was saying, but there were a lot of F-bombs coming from him towards the ref,” Watson said. “I think there was some kind of call that he wanted that he wasn't getting.”
“At some point, when he got into the box, the guy I was with sitting next to me started yelling at him,” Watson continued. “People in the crowd behind us were yelling at him. Barch was looking at us, but we couldn't really make out anything that he was saying because it was so loud.”
Watson then noticed a man seated directly to the left of the penalty box in the front row get his iPhone out. He was taking video of the whole thing.
“There was a little kid next to him and you could see Barch begin to chat with him,” Watson said. “I don't know what he was saying, but I'm pretty sure the older guy with the phone yelled out to Barch, ‘Give me a smile with that pretty face.'”
Watson claims that he heard Barch say, “Here. Take a picture of this, you bleep bleep.”
So Barch dug into this mouth and ripped out his tooth. Wait, what? So that really happened?
“He really did pull out his tooth,” Watson said to me emphatically.
“Then he threw it and it hits the little kid,” Watson continued. “The kid sits down and grabs it. All of us come over, ‘Did he really throw that to you? Is that really his tooth?' The little kid was on cloud nine.”
Watson later took a photo with the tooth in his hand.
Long-time Washington Capitals fan Matt Fierce was the person who took video of the incident. He provided a copy of it to RMNB.
Fierce explained that his dad was nice enough to give him two tickets to the game that night. He decided to bring the only person who he thought would enjoy the game as much as he would, his 10-year-old nephew Grant.
Grant, a polite and precocious fifth grader at Blessed Sacrament, plays hockey in Virginia for the Caps Academy Peewee B Travel Team. He was the one who caught the tooth.
“It was awesome,” Grant said to me on the phone about receiving such a unique souvenir.
“The week after the game, I showed my classmates and everyone that didn't play hockey — like all of the girls — and they went, ‘ewwwww,' Grant explained to me. “My best friend that's a hockey player said, ‘That's awesome.'”
“Then the girls said, ‘that's gross.' I told them I didn't care.” Grant said proudly.
I asked Grant why he thought Barch threw part of his own body into the crowd. With logic of an adorable 10-year-old, Grant said, “I honestly think he did it to show all his lady friends that he's tough.”
Yes, that was definitely it. It's definitely not because Barch is crazy.
Barch's tooth remains in Grant and Matt's custody. They hope to be able to get it authenticated somehow someday. I think at this point, however, they have more than enough evidence to prove it's Barch's.
“That was totally the most bizarre thing I've ever seen at a hockey game,” Watson told me in conclusion. “It's one of those things where you have to see it to believe it.”
I've seen it and I still don't believe it. But at least now you know the truth: it did happen.

I've taken about five brief breaks while writing this review to play You Must Build a Boat (#ymbab). The game has its hooks in my brain. Yes, EightyEightGames' latest title really is that good and this is coming from someone who has never been a big fan of puzzle games.
While the puzzle role playing game (PRPG) genre is relatively established in the video game world, this is the first time I've played a game of this type beyond dabbling with 10,000,000 for a brief period a few years ago.
Sometimes it feels like every video game wants to borrow something from the RPG genre. Most modern racing games task the player with levelling up their vehicle, and sports titles seem to always want you to increase your players' attributes.
This is far from a bad thing, though. RPGs offer some of gaming's most compelling experiences, and have an interesting way of motivating the player to continue pushing forward with incremental rewards.
EightyEightGames' You Must Build a Boat continues the trend of infusing RPG gameplay elements into a puzzle game in the best way possible. But why are you building a boat in the first place? The game cheekily reminds you of your ultimate goal after you complete every level as well as during its intro sequence, but you'll never be given an answer to the question above. The amusing air of mystery surrounding exactly why you're building a sea bearing vessel only adds to #ymbab's appeal.
You Must Build a Boat is a continuation of 10,000,000, EightyEightGames' first genre-bending triple tile-matching, endless runner-puzzle game, and anyone familiar with that particular title will instantly feel right at home with #ymbab.
In You Must Build a Boat the player is tasked with matching a variety of different types of tiles in rows of three while an adventurer progresses in a small box on the top of the screen. You'll encounter enemies that are weak against magic attacks (which means you'll likely want to match three staff tiles), and treasure chests (which force you to match keys).
If you take too long to find a corresponding triple match (or more than a triple match), your character will lose ground and slowly shift to the back of the screen. If you completely fall off the display your run is over, although the game still amusingly says, “You Win” at the finale of every attempt. Simple mission objectives are also thrown into the mix and often involve matching a certain number of tiles. These goals help ensure you always have a reason to continue playing You Must Build a Boat.
There is also a lot of variety in You Must Build a Boat, especially for a puzzle game. Every monster you encounter has specific weaknesses and strengths, and the better you memorize each enemies' characteristics, the more successful you'll be. (On your boat there is a quirky character named Woodward who explains each foe's stats.)
You Must Build a Boat's strategic tile-matching system gives the game a sense of purpose (and sometimes urgency when I needed to find that last set of keys) I've never felt before in a puzzle title. You aren't just working to clear a screen or towards a high score – two main goals in most puzzle games which have never quite clicked with me. For someone who has never really understood the appeal of puzzle games, this new spin on the genre is definitely welcome.
But while You Must Build a Boat shares similarities with 10,000,000, EightyEightGames has added a few features beyond just a pixelated boat when it comes to the developer's puzzle formula. Traps are a new addition in #ymbab, hovering over your character's head at random and holding an icon you'll need to match in a short period of time. Items, such as magical spells, a bow and arrow and scrolls, are also now part of #ymbab's puzzle grid, rather than items laid out across the top of the screen like in 10,000,000.
Your ever-expanding boat also allows you to upgrade your spells, staff, and sword, and even recruit enemies you've encountered in your travels, Pokemon-style. These creature then help you in battle, giving the player even more reasons to continue playing. The only issue I have with #ymbab is that you can't play it in landscape mode, a small but frustrating oversight for a title where seeing your entire play space is so important.
You Must Build a Boat is one of those rare games I completely misjudged after watching its release trailer. Initially I thought EightyEightGames' latest title was just another pixelated retro-infused platformer looking to capitalize on the people's nostalgia. Thankfully, #ymbab is significantly more than this.
In fact, I'd even say it's the first game to make me finally understand the appeal of the puzzle genre. Whether you're a fan of puzzle games, or just pick-up-and-play mobile gaming in general, you'll find a lot to like about You Must Build a Boat.
You Must Build a Boat is available on iOS for $3.49, Android for $3.79 and Steam for $5.49.

Last week a a former Houston TX. female high school teacher pleaded guilty to having an inappropriate sexual relationship with one of her students but, predictably, avoided a jail sentence.
Nikki Scherwitz, 25, was sentenced to 10 years probation and fined $5,000.
While the light sentence does not come as a surprise for most, what is unusual about this story are the reactions of the local community and local news media. Residents and students alike were very vocal about the unfairness of the punishment, and even more importantly they were quick to openly point out the double standard when it comes to sentencing men for the same crime.
“The men get 25 to life, but a woman gets a slap on the wrist with only a $5,000 fine,” said Mario Salinas, a student at Brazosport High School.
“If it was a guy, a male teacher with a female student, it wouldn't be the same,” agreed Oscar Guttierrez, another student.
Prosecutors justified the plea bargain saying that the victim was almost 17, the legal age of consent in Texas. They also pointed out that she will be considered a felon and has to comply with very strict probationary conditions.
Local news station KHOU 11 aired a segment about the case and featured a legal expert who invoked the 14th amendment's equal protection clause.
Paul Elam of A Voice for Men, as well as other men's rights activists, noted the refreshing tone of the news coverage.
“That a sexual predator was given a slap on the wrist because she is female is not news” said Elam. “What is different in this case is that Channel 11 News in Houston actually quoted students who are clearly aware of the sexual bias in the courts.”

College basketball's preseason magazines have hit the newsstands, and it's always fun to check out preseason top 25s. Let's face it: Much of it is a guessing game and is based on a combination of last season's success, the number of key returnees and the quality of the newcomers.
While I agree with many of my colleagues, certainly a few teams are getting a little too much credit.
Which are the most overrated teams in the preseason?
UCLA Bruins
Freshman point guard Lonzo Ball is fun to watch, but will coach Steve Alford put the ball in his hands and let him go? That's the key. Ball just flat-out makes people around him better with his tremendous court vision and passing ability. However, I'm not sold that Ball will ultimately be the primary ballhandler with Bryce Alford and Aaron Holiday on the roster. When you look at the talent on this roster, it's impressive: Ball, Alford, Holiday, Isaac Hamilton, Thomas Welsh and skilled freshman forward T.J. Leaf. But this is also a group that went 15-17 overall and finished ahead of only Arizona State and Washington State in the Pac-12 a year ago. I'm just not sold the Bruins are worthy of top-25 inclusion.
Wisconsin Badgers
Some have the Badgers in the top 10. Wow. That's a little high. The Badgers turned it on under coach Greg Gard last season, then made an improbable Sweet 16 appearance. Gard brings back everyone: Bronson Koenig, Nigel Hayes, Ethan Happ as well as fellow starters Vitto Brown and Zak Showalter. But I can't get the vision out of my head of Hayes struggling in the NCAA tourney. Wisconsin could be a top-20 team virtually all season, but I'm not sold on top-10.
Creighton Bluejays
The Bluejays seem to be a favorite of just about everyone who compiled a top 25 this season, with a 20-15 record from a year ago and the addition of former Kansas State guard Marcus Foster. Can Foster return to his freshman form, when he was one of the top scoring guards in the Big 12, or will he revert to the player who was an issue for Bruce Weber as a sophomore? Maurice Watson Jr., and Cole Huff had success for coach Greg McDermott a year ago, but the Big East will still be tough at the top with Villanova and Xavier -- as well as Seton Hall and Georgetown. I'm just not quite ready to throw Creighton in the top 25 just yet.
Rhode Island Rams
Coach Danny Hurley was without his best player, E.C. Matthews, for nearly the entire season, and Matthews will be back. But the Rams haven't proved anything of note yet, going 17-15 a year ago and 9-9 in league play. There's certainly some pressure on this group this season with Hassan Martin and Kuran Iverson being seniors and Matthews hoping to leave for the NBA after this year. The Rams are in just about everyone's top 25, and while they look the part on paper, they need to do it on the court.
Maryland Terrapins
A couple of polls have mentioned the Terps. Coach Mark Turgeon returns Melo Trimble, but first things first: Which Trimble will return? The one who was considered one of the best point guards in the country and could both make shots and also make those around him better, or the one from the second half of last season who couldn't make shots and struggled to run the team? Then there's the fact of Turgeon's having to replace four starters: Diamond Stone, Robert Carter, Jake Layman and Rasheed Sulaimon. This could be a bit of a rebuilding year in College Park.
Mission Original
launch date(s) Shuttle Landing site Mission details
STS-1A
OFT-1 June 1979 Columbia Edwards Originally scheduled as the first orbital test. The crew was to consist of a commander and pilot, and the test flight was to last 2 days and 5 hours. No crew was named at the initial announcement of the mission, but John Young and Robert Crippen were officially announced as the STS-1 crew in March 1978, when the shuttle was still originally scheduled for a 1979 launch.[4]
STS-3
OFT-3 September 1979 Columbia Edwards Originally scheduled as the third orbital flight test. The 7-day mission was to see the two-man crew (commander and pilot) test shuttle maneuvering and remote manipulator systems.
STS-4
OFT-4 December 1979 Columbia Edwards Originally scheduled as the fourth orbital flight test. The crew was to consist of a commander and pilot, and the mission was to last seven days.
STS-5
OFT-5 February 1980 Columbia Kennedy Originally scheduled as the fifth orbital flight test. The crew was to consist of commander Ken Mattingly, pilot Henry Hartsfield and one or two mission specialists.[8] The mission was to last 7 days. First landing at Kennedy Space Center.
STS-6
OFT-6 March 1980 Columbia Edwards Originally scheduled as the sixth orbital flight test. The crew of four were to conduct first test of operational payloads and conduct the first EVA from the shuttle. The mission was to last seven days.
STS-7 30 May 1980
27 February 1981 Columbia Kennedy First operational flight. The crew of three were to place the LDEF satellite into orbit and the mission was to last five days. The LDEF was eventually released in 1984 from Challenger during STS-41-C. By 1979, when it became clear that the original launch schedule could not be kept to, STS-7 was re-manifested with the TDRS-A satellite and scheduled to launch on 27 February 1981 with a crew of four and a duration of two days. This rescheduled STS-7 would also have landed at Kennedy Space Center.[9]
STS-8 1 July 1980 Columbia Edwards The crew of three were to place the satellites TDRS-A and SBS-A into orbit during the 2-day mission. TDRS-A was sent into orbit on Challenger's maiden flight, STS-6, in April 1983.
STS-9 1 August 1980 Columbia Edwards The crew of three were to place the satellites GOES 4 and Anik-C1 into orbit during the 3-day mission. GOES 4 was launched atop a Delta 3914 a month after its originally scheduled launch on the shuttle. After this mission, Columbia would be returned to the Rockwell plant at Palmdale for removal of the ejection seats and test instrumentation and would receive higher capacity fuel cells, all in preparation for the first Spacelab mission.
STS-10 14 November 1980 Columbia Edwards Originally scheduled for launch on 1980. The crew of three were to place the satellites TDRS-B and SBS-B into orbit during the 3-day mission. TDRS-B was rescheduled for STS-51-E but became re-manifested on STS-51-L, where it was destroyed along with Challenger on 28 January 1986.
STS-11 18 December 1980 Columbia Edwards Scheduled to carry the European Spacelab-1 science module. The crew of five were to consist of three NASA astronauts and two European payload specialists. The mission was to last seven days. This first Spacelab mission was later launched as STS-9 in November 1983.
STS-12 30 January 1981 Columbia Edwards The crew of three were to place the satellites TDRS-C and Anik-C2 into orbit during the 2-day mission. An alternate mission was also planned which replaced the TDRS-C with an Intelsat-V satellite, and would last five days instead of two. TDRS-C was eventually made as the replacement for the destroyed TDRS-B and launched from Discovery on STS-26 in September 1988.
STS-13 3 March 1981 Columbia Edwards The crew of three were to place the GOES-E satellite into orbit during the 5-day mission. GOES-E was eventually launched on a Delta 3914 over two months after its originally scheduled launch on the shuttle.
STS-14 7 April 1981 Columbia Edwards Scheduled to carry four Spacelab instrumentation pallets and a pressurized "igloo" used to support the payloads. The crew of five were to consist of two payload specialists. The mission was to last 12 days.
STS-15 13 May 1981 Columbia Edwards During this mission, the satellites TDRS-D and SBS-C would be placed into orbit. The Anik-C3 satellite could be substituted in place of SBS-C. TDRS-D was launched from Discovery on STS-29 in March 1989, with SBS-C being launched on Columbia's first operational mission, STS-5, in November 1982.
STS-16 16 June 1981 Columbia Edwards Originally scheduled for launch on 16 June 1981, carrying the Spacelab-3 science module. A "payload of opportunity" of 9 tons (8.16 mt) also existed, which could accommodate a communications satellite. The crew of five were to consist of two payload specialists.
STS-17 16 July 1981 Enterprise Edwards Originally to be the first spaceflight of the shuttle Enterprise. It was to place an Intelsat V satellite into orbit and retrieve the LDEF. Enterprise never flew in space, and instead its place as the second shuttle in the fleet was taken by Challenger.
STS-18 29 July 1981 Columbia Edwards Scheduled to carry a Spacelab pallet and pressurized "igloo". A tentative planned payload would be flown for the Department of Defense, which would make it the first such payload flown on the Shuttle.
STS-19 2 September 1981 Columbia Edwards Was to carry a series of five Spacelab pallets.
STS-20 30 September 1981 Enterprise Edwards Originally scheduled for launch on 30 September 1981, carrying the Spacelab-4 life-science module and an unpressurized Spacelab pallet.
STS-21 14 October 1981 Columbia Edwards A crew of three was to retrieve the Solar Maximum Mission satellite and bring it back to Earth after a five-day mission. Columbia would have carried an "OMS Kit" which contained additional fuel for the shuttle's Orbital Maneuvering System, necessary to safely reach the SMM's orbit. The SMM, launched in February 1980, was eventually retrieved and repaired in orbit on STS-41-C in 1984, and continued operating until 1989.
STS-22 25 November 1981 Enterprise Edwards Was planned to carry an ESA-operated Spacelab module and additional pallet.

The folks behind Pirate Bay are upset over a new Web site from antipiracy group CIAPC that looks just like their own site.
To kick off its latest antipiracy campaign, the Finland-based CIAPC (Copyright Information and Anti-Piracy Center) set up a new Web site urging people to find more legal means to download music, TV shows, and other digital content. To hammer home its point, the CIAPC site intentionally borrowed the exact design and style of the Pirate Bay site.
The group even duplicated the CSS stylesheet used by the Pirate Bay, ensuring that its site is a virtual duplicate, according to torrent news site TorrentFreak. The only difference is that the CIAPC's site shows an image of a sinking ship in contrast to the floating pirate ship that marks the Pirate Bay site.
But the move may land the CIAPC in hot water.

"We are outraged by this behavior," a Pirate Bay spokesman told TorrentFreak. "People must understand what is right and wrong. Stealing material like this on the Internet is a threat to economies worldwide. We feel that we must make a statement and therefore we will sue them for copyright infringement."
The Pirate Bay's usage policy states that organizations can use the system only if they first get permission from the system operators, something the CIAPC obviously didn't do. As such, the site imposes a fine on any group that violates the terms.
"We reserve the rights to charge for usage of the site in case this policy is violated," the policy states. "The charge will consist of a basic fee of EUR 5,000 ($6,663) plus bandwidth and other costs that may arise due to the violation."
The CIAPC isn't likely to pay the fine, so the Pirate Bay could try to take the group to court.
The Pirate Bay itself is no stranger to lawsuits. Its site provides links to torrents, allowing people to freely download music, TV shows, movies, and apps. As such, it's gotten into legal skirmishes over copyright infringement. But the site somehow has a way of staying alive.
In February 2012, the Pirate Bay stopped hosting torrents directly and instead became more of a search engine for people to download files from other torrent sites.
A spokesman for the CIAPC told CNET that it hopes "the operators of the Pirate Bay site come out publicly with their true identities and get in touch with the CIAPC."
CNET contacted the Pirate Bay for comment and will update the story if we receive any information.
Updated at 4:30 a.m. PT February 15 with response from the CIAPC.
A senior political figure who shall remain nameless, but is currently mayor of London, once told me that on the final day of general election campaigning he had just enough time left to visit one of two places: a students' hall of residence or an old people's home. He chose the old people's home.
The calculation was clear: it was in the old people's home that he stood the better chance of meeting actual voters. To his credit, he knew something drastic needed to be done about this, but it was a sad acknowledgement that in politics the young are nowhere near the front of the queue.
Around 75% of people aged 65 and over will vote in this election; unless something thunderously radical happens in the next six weeks, only around 42% of 18- to 24-year-olds will do the same. The over-65s coming out to vote and the under-24s staying in has been the norm for the past few decades. This is why we're now all hearing so much about the pros and cons of the triple lock on pensions, but absolutely nothing about student fees and housing benefit.
The older electorate has become an effective voting lobby, more powerful than the gas industry. Because the over-65s turn out in such large numbers, every politician needs to court them and doesn't want to utter a single word that will alienate them or drive any of them to political opponents.
Why can't it be like this for 18- to 24-year-olds? If they registered and voted in force, they would become powerfully unignorable. I admit that “Powerfully Unignorable” is not a great campaign slogan, but it's much better than “Mostly Forgotten”.
Of course, a lot of young voters choose not to vote because they've been put off by what's on offer. When the prime minister asks to consult the electorate but refuses to be consulted by it in televised debates, what's the point of joining the discussion? When parties steal each other's tactics and policies – Labour going all out for Brexit, the Tories pinching old Ed Miliband policies such as caps on energy bills, and the Lib Dems, the party of coalition, declare they will not do coalitions, then it's easy to wail, “they're all as bad as each other” and stay indoors.
But the reality is this is an act of protest that immediately becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's no coincidence that the collapse in the 18- to 24-year-old vote has seen the advent of tuition fees, reductions in housing benefit for 18- to 21-year-olds, the scrapping of the education maintenance allowance, no entry to the “national living wage” until the age of 25, and cuts to student disability allowances.
These are measures taken in recent years by Labour, Conservative and Lib Dem ministers alike because, in the end, the youth vote was never going to trouble them. So, if financial savings were going to have to be made somewhere, they were going to be made from young people. This in turn has produced disenchantment: if the young are going to be so neglected, why should they bother voting? And so it spirals on: each reduction in registration and turnout met with a further opportunity for ministers to raid young people's resources. While older voters are invited to the top table, the young are dumped around the back by the bins.
That's why, for this election, I've been joining others and urging 18- to 24-year-olds to reverse this cycle by registering to vote and then getting out and using that vote. My advice doesn't get any less basic than this: just vote. Yes, I assume a large percentage of young voters are likely to vote for progressive parties. That's great. I'm all for it.
But really, each vote is each voter's privilege, to do with what they like. So, go out and vote any which way you think is best. Vote for who you really believe in. If you don't believe in anyone, vote for who you think might make any kind of difference, whether it's to your constituency or to the makeup of the next parliament. Vote with your heart or your head, I don't mind; that's your quiet moment. Spoil your vote if you want to. Just get out and vote.
The material benefits are clear. If young voters turn out in large numbers, then they become a powerful bloc that needs to be heeded and addressed. It's the basic politics of self-interest: the more 18- to 24-year-olds vote, the more their concerns will be taken seriously.
But there's idealism in this too. It's about keeping democracy healthy. If we don't participate in democracy, we won't have much of a democracy left in which to participate. The truly wasted vote is the one that isn't cast.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not ignoring the fat sheaf of opinion polls predicting a huge Conservative majority. But it makes me all the more determined to point out to voters the many ways a vote can still be used effectively.
Although we were all mostly appalled by Donald Trump's victory, there is some consolation that he has the courts and Congress placing checks and balances on him. In Britain, we don't have these restraints. Total power resides with the prime minister. The bigger the majority, the more unchecked her (or his) sway across health, education, taxation, benefits, and indeed all legislation, not just Brexit negotiations.
And it is possible to act to stop that majority from growing, if that's what most concerns you. It's now possible to find out via websites such as Votingcounts.org.uk, Tactical2017.com and Compassonline.org.uk what the best option is in your constituency.
For too long, politicians have played a cynical game in which they target the slim minority of the electorate who hold the balance of power – the target seats with slender majorities, the swing states, the key regions. It's a system that took a awful lot of the electorates for granted. That system ran aground last year. Populist explosions not just for Marine Le Pen and Trump but for the likes of Nigel Farage, Bernie Sanders and Emmanuel Macron in France are the extremely loud shouts of frustration from whole sections of the electorate who have been feeling more ignored or taken for granted. It has made the electorate more unpredictable, more loudly disloyal, which in turn has stirred fear in established political parties. In short, the parties don't know what we're up to, and they really don't like it.
That's good, because it puts power back where it belongs, with the voter. The downside, though, is that votes can go in either direction. Brexit, the election of Trump, the rise of Le Pen, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's increasing autocracy in Turkey; these are the will of democratic electorates. Unpredictability is extremely unpredictable. Votes matter and those who don't vote risk getting not more of the same but the opposite of all they believe in.
HOW THEY VOTED

■ Since 1992, voter turnout has fallen – with the sharpest declines among voters aged 18-24 and 25-34.
■ In 1992, 75.4% of 18-24s voted, but this dropped to 44.3% by 2005. Among 25-34 year olds, the number of people voting fell from 86.6% to 55.2%, according to British Election Survey data. In 2015, it is thought the turnout among those aged 18-24 rose to 58%.
■ The turnout among 18-24s in the EU referendum is thought to have been higher than anticipated at 64%, the London School of Economics says.

In light of the Oregon attorney general's decision to not defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage, Oregon is now revising its marriage licenses to include forms for same-sex couples.
Previously, when people applied for a marriage license, they were asked either to identify as a “bride” or “groom.” Now, the new form designates as “Party A” and “Party B.” Applicants can also choose to be identified as “bride,” “groom” or “spouse.”
Another change to marriage licenses: eliminating the term “maiden name.” Instead, applicants will be asked to provide their “name at birth.”
Most of Oregon's counties use an electronic version of the marriage form. Clerks are in the process of working with a software vendor to update the online forms.
Two lawsuits alleging Oregon's 2004 ban violates the U.S. Constitution have been consolidated, and U.S. District Judge Michael McShane has scheduled April 23 oral arguments in the case.

Certain organizational features of brain networks present in the individual are lost when central tendencies are examined in the group. Here we investigated the detailed network organization of four individuals each scanned 24 times using MRI. We discovered that the distributed network known as the default network is comprised of two separate networks possessing adjacent regions in eight or more cortical zones. A distinction between the networks is that one is coupled to the hippocampal formation while the other is not. Further exploration revealed that these two networks were juxtaposed with additional networks that themselves fractionate group-defined networks. The collective networks display a repeating spatial progression in multiple cortical zones, suggesting that they are embedded within a broad macroscale gradient. Regions contributing to the newly defined networks are spatially variable across individuals and adjacent to distinct networks, raising issues for network estimation in group-averaged data and applied endeavors, including targeted neuromodulation.

Group averaging was necessary in positron emission tomography (PET) studies as radiation places severe restrictions on repeat imaging. A major technical breakthrough came with the ability to average brain volumes across individuals to boost signal to noise (e.g.,). However, group-averaging approaches are limited due to blurring over anatomical and functional variability ().
Motivated by these findings, we conducted an extensive set of analyses focused on the individual. We discovered that the DN could be reliably subdivided into parallel networks within the individual. Similar separations were made for other major networks. Regions of the separate networks lay side by side across distributed zones of cortex and were sufficiently variable between individuals to obscure their existence in group-averaged analyses. To make these observations, we analyzed data from four individuals scanned repeatedly over 24 sessions.
From Lakefront:
MILWAUKEE (May 18, 2017) – Lakefront Brewery has been retooling its brand, continuing to keep up with a changing market. From a logo update to graphics to beer brands, everything is becoming stronger and more focused. “Successful brands live in a very narrow space,” said Lakefront Brewery Brand Manager, Michael Stodola. “Over the next 6 months, Lakefront fans will see our transformation. It's more about dependability, fun and an honest day's work.”
Even longtime, beloved brands will see an update. Riverwest Stein, Fuel Café, Eastside Dark and others will be showing up on shelves this summer with a new look. Chris Johnson, Director of Business Development said, “With our 30th anniversary right around the corner, it was a good time to reevaluate our image and identity in the market.”
Russ Klisch, Owner and Co-Founder of Lakefront Brewery said, “From our beginnings on Chambers street 30 years ago to now, our image continues a steady climb upward. This is another great step.” Klisch started the brewery in 1987 with his brother, Jim. “We've learned a lot about this business and about ourselves. Innovation, growth and being fresh are keys to success in the craft beer world. We're lucky to have enjoyed all three.”
Look for new Lakefront packaging to be popping up everywhere over the summer. From bottle labels and 6-packs, to 12-packs and tap handles, Lakefront Brewery is prepping for the next 30 years. There are even more new beers arriving. “We're starting a new Double IPA series kicking off in July, as well as a new Single Hop (SHOP) series,” says Johnson. “And look for a 30th anniversary beer, the Lakefront 30, and a Black Friday special reserve.----
“We're only 30 years old. Time to celebrate our success, our city and our fans,” says Klisch.
Recap
Deng leads Bulls over Pacers in preseason
Posted Oct 22 2010 10:33PM
CHICAGO (AP) Luol Deng had 29 points and eight rebounds to lead the Chicago Bulls to 102-74 preseason victory over the Indiana Pacers on Friday night.
Derrick Rose added 14 points and six assists for the Bulls (4-4) in their final preseason game before Wednesday night's opener at the Oklahoma City Thunder.
Indiana Pacers President of Basketball Operations Larry Bird watched the blowout from a few rows behind the bench.
Darren Collison and Roy Hibbert both had 14 point for Indiana (3-4), which played without Danny Granger and T.J. Ford.
The Pacers open the season at San Antonio on Wednesday.
Chicago scored 10 straight points to take a 25-13 lead. Deng scored four points in the span and had 15 points in the first quarter, going 10 for 10 from the line. Chicago closed the first half on a 13-4 run to take a 59-38 lead.
Deng finished the half with 17 points and Rose added 11.
It was the second straight game the Pacers were without Granger and Ford. Granger sprained his left ankle and Ford didn't play because of a strained right hamstring.
Bulls center Joakim Noah missed his second consecutive game with the flu. Kyle Korver played after missing Wednesday's game against Toronto with an ankle cyst. He scored seven points.

Photo: Cesar A. Gonzalez Brain Scanner: A device can quickly spot a brain injury by measuring the organ's impedance using RF energy.
Researchers have developed an inexpensive helmetlike device that scans the brain with radio-frequency signals to immediately reveal signs of brain damage. They claim that using this tool could be a quick, cheap way to tell whether a person has a potentially life-threatening brain injury that would require a hospital visit for detailed medical imaging. This would be especially useful in rural settings, where the nearest big hospital is often many kilometers away.
The technology is simple to use and could cost as little as a blood-pressure measurement device, says Boris Rubinsky, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, who has been developing the technique for various applications over the past six years.
The invention is based on the idea that healthy and abnormal brain tissue conduct alternating current differently. In tests on humans, reported in the 14 May issue of PLoS ONE, Rubinsky and his colleagues could differentiate between healthy and injured brains by measuring this difference. Among the damaged brains, they could distinguish whether there was tissue swelling or internal bleeding.
Symptoms of swelling or bleeding in the brain are not immediately obvious. The sure way to know is with magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography (CT) scans. But the detailed images generated from those techniques might not be necessary in many situations. And in rural areas or in economically disadvantaged parts of the world, such as Mexico and India, those imaging technologies are expensive and not readily available, Rubinsky says.
“Say a child falls down in an accident,” he says. With no outward signs of brain trauma, “if the parents are poor and far from a local hospital, they may not take the child to the hospital. But if there was a very inexpensive device locally in the village to determine that there is an injury, they'd take the child.”
The helmetlike device has two coils that are placed on either side of the head. One coil emits radio-frequency signals at 1 to 200 megahertz. These signals travel through the brain to reach the receiving coil. The impedance of different tissue changes noticeably over a specific narrow frequency range, Rubinsky explains. In a normal brain, this change shows up over a certain set of frequencies, while in tissue infused with saline or blood it occurs over other frequency ranges. A computer algorithm analyzes the signals from the receiver coil to spot this shift, thereby determining if the brain tissue is normal or if it contains excess blood from internal bleeding or excess fluid indicative of swelling.
Rubinsky's colleague César A. González, a professor at the National Polytechnic Institute's Superior School of Medicine, in Mexico, tested the device on 46 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with brain damage at a military hospital in Mexico. He confirmed the results with CT scans.
Rubinsky says that data from the device could be sent via cellphone to a central hospital processing facility to avoid the need for a computer at local rural sites. The technology could be adapted to measure brain health and could also be used for detecting tumors and infections, he adds.
The new technology could be more cost-effective than other similar techniques, such as electrical impedance tomography, which makes it suitable for developing countries, says Te Tang, a biomedical engineering professor at Florida State University. Tang adds that the pilot study is encouraging.
However, says Kenneth Foster, professor of bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, “to succeed, the method would have to be reliable and also suitable for use by relatively unsophisticated operators.” Proving its reliability will require more-extensive, better-designed studies.

"I'm not like most girls."
- Most girls (via stone-)
We need some perspective here. One of the deeper lessons I've learned is that while there are lots of people who have similar tendencies, it doesn't quite cut neatly across gender lines.
There are lots of guys working to be pick-up artists, as you're well-aware. Their methods, as crass as they are, work. But they work because 1) they go to lots of women in bars and 2) there are all sorts of different women in different situations there. Part of me thinks that certain women play along with the pick-up artist game: they know the guy is trying to be something more, and that's attractive in a weird way. Again, emphasis on “certain.”
The deeper lesson: there is no such thing as all men are the same, no such thing as all women are the same. Yes, women tend to like flowers and dancing and chocolates. Yes, men tend to like sports. But it's not clear what any of that adds up to. I recently was at a bar and talking to a former soccer player about American football. He would talk about how his team needed to make this trade or that trade to be better, or if only they had such and such a coach they'd win every game. I listened and asked questions, some about his experiences playing, hoping for an answer to this question: Are there certain things a former athlete notices about sport that isn't his which others wouldn't notice? (I think the answer is: not necessarily. They can be just as obnoxious a fan as the guy who call into local sports radio).
Point is: you've got two entirely different approaches to the concept of “sport.” One guy's a fan who wants to win. The other is trying to learn more about the game. There's nothing wrong with either guy (okay, maybe there's something wrong with me). But you're missing a lot if you reduce men to “all the same” because many have an interest in sports.
“I'm not like most girls” is a usually defensive reaction. Yeah, it's predictable. But don't think because women tend to be concerned about something that they're worse because of it. Some things are important and they should be concerned about them. Sometimes they should be defensive. Maybe the “girl” in question would be a bit less defensive if she were treated like she is unique. She is, after all. I can show you women who serve in the Armed Forces and want everything in their life to be pink. I can show you women who are extremely stoic, have terrible taste in furniture and clothes, and are absolute geniuses. I can show you women who are terrific writers, others that won't read a word even if you promised to pay them a million dollars for it. If you're serious about relationships, you need to be serious about how people are different.

The Illinois Department of Transportation is considering adding a carpool and express toll lane to Interstate 290, an official confirmed Friday.
IDOT officials provided an update on their proposed reconstruction of the Eisenhower Expressway Wednesday, the Chicago Tribune's Pioneer Press reported.
"Let buses use it for free, let people that are in carpools use it for free, but if you want to use it in a single-occupant vehicle, you're gonna have to pay," Secretary of Transportation Randy Blankenhorn told NBC 5.
The proposed tolls for ineligible cars using the lane could run between 12 cents and 25 cents per mile, officials said, depending on the time of day.
The agency has identified three toll rates: peak hour, peak shoulder and off-peak, an official said.
IDOT aims to add a fourth lane to I-290 in each direction between Mannheim Road and Austin Boulevard, the newspaper reports. The agency would then convert the two center lanes, between I-88 and Racine Avenue, to a "Hot 3+" lane, which would allow carpool vehicles and buses to ride for free. Other commuters could also use the lane but would be charged a toll. Three traffic lanes in each direction would remain free for drivers, the Pioneer Press reports.
"If you're in a carpool of three or more, you ride in (the lane) for free," Pete Harmet of IDOT said. "Everyone else has to pay a toll. The idea is to set a toll rate so you have a 45 mile-per-hour speed through there, minimum, so that is then a reliable trip. As we know, there are days when the Eisenhower is quite unreliable."
IDOT officials cited Florida and California as states where carpool lanes are enforced by either registration or turning a transponder on while carpooling.
Harmet said there had been no final decisions made on how to charge the proposed tolls.
Travelers looking for ever-more convenient ways to get to Yunnan's more secluded areas are increasingly booking airline tickets. In an effort to meet this growing demand, tourist hot-spot Tengchong has added three new air routes connecting it with other major travel destinations in the province.
Regularly scheduled flights now link Tengchong Hump Airport (腾冲驼峰机场) to Dali, Lijiang and Jinghong in Xishuangbanna, InKunming is reporting. Several of the flights have layovers in Kunming before reaching their final destinations. All of the new routes are handled by China Eastern Airlines.
Flights to and from Tengchong are another step toward upgrading airline connectivity between many of Yunnan's smaller cities.
Plans are also underway to begin services between Lijiang, Pu'er, Dehong and Wenshan. As air travel options in the province grow, lengthy transfers in Kunming and other airports could conceivably be phased out.
Earlier this year Lijiang received permission from central authorities to begin scheduling international flights. By also connecting to Tengchong, Lijiang airport moves closer to establishing itself as a major travel hub in southwest China.
The Tengchong airport originally opened in 2009 and is named after the air route over the Himalayas flown by the American Volunteer Group (aka the Flying Tigers) and the commercial airliner China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) during World War II. The airport has the capacity to handle 300,000 passengers a year.

When I was a kid, I bought a wooden labyrinth. I ended up not liking it much as I wasn't great at it and it was always the same. The Blobs, a game I see as similar to labyrinth, are much, much better (not to mention cheaper).
This maze game is much more than an avoid-the-holes game. While there are holes in some levels, there are also moving spikes, shooters, trap doors, fans, and more to avoid, all while trying to obtain the three stars of each level and while trying to keep your blob in one piece. Surprisingly the game does not become overly difficult. Parts of the game (fans for example) are frustrating, but it's a good kind of challenge. There is a good difficulty progression along with a good balance of obstacles.
In this game there are 120 levels across 6 worlds. Some games may become tiring or boring after a while but this game does not. After finishing a level for the first time I immediately press next level.
Each world is dramatically different. Each level is also usually significantly different than the one before it. This is good. You never know what the next level will be like. The only time that the level design is troublesome is when wooden floors look like they have holes that you can fall through.
Besides this, though, the game is excellent. It's a very unique and entertaining spin on the old (and more boring) game called Labyrinth.
Update: We have just heard from the creators that a free 12 level trial is due out next week on the App Store.
Police say a customer drinking coffee at a 7-Eleven store in Seattle shot and killed a masked man who swung a hatchet at him and the store clerk. (Reuters)
A masked man burst into a 7-Eleven near Seattle early Sunday morning, swinging a hatchet and slicing the store clerk.
Before the masked man could seriously hurt anyone, though, a customer who was drinking his morning coffee pulled out a concealed weapon and fatally shot the attacker.
Authorities did not name the attacker or the customer, but they did hail the concealed weapon owner as a hero.
“This could have been disastrous,” King County Sheriff Sgt. Cindi West told KIRO7. “Had this guy not shot, who knows what would have happened? We might have a dead clerk right now, and instead we have a dead bad guy.”
The clerk, Kuldeep Singh, suffered minor cuts to his stomach. He, too, thanked the customer for saving his life.
“He [was] killing me,” Singh, 58, said of the hatchet-wielding attacker. Singh added that the customer was a “nice guy.”
West said that the incident will be investigated fully but that the 60-year-old customer was currently being considered a Good Samaritan.
The “customer, the shooter, is shaken up but from everything that we see right now from the scene – there's no wrongdoing on his part,” she told King 5. “In fact, he probably saved a life in this case.”
The incident near Burien, Wash., about eight miles south of downtown Seattle, probably will add to the ongoing debate about concealed weapons and their effect on crime.
Concealed-weapon ownership has skyrocketed in recent years as more states have moved to allow it. The percentage of Americans who believe owning a gun will protect them and others also has risen steadily.
There is little consensus on the efficacy of concealed weapons in reducing crime, however. Although supporters of concealed-weapon ownership argue that it discourages crime, some studies have shown it has no effect. Other studies have found it actually increases crime.
Anecdotal evidence abounds on both sides of the argument.

In January, a man in Renton, Wash., just a few miles away from Burien, brought his concealed weapon into a movie theater. Dane Gallion was reportedly worried about public shootings. Instead of stopping one, however, he committed one, shooting a woman in the back in what his attorney later claimed was an accident. Gallion was arrested and charged with third-degree assault.

Similarly, a Michigan woman was charged with misdemeanor reckless use of a handgun after she shot at shoplifters fleeing a Home Depot in October. After she was sentenced to 18 months probation, Tatiana Duva-Rodriguez said she would “never help anybody again.”
Both individuals were stripped of their rights to carry concealed weapons.

In November, when a would-be robber burst into a Chicago bodega waving what looked like a handgun, a customer with a concealed weapon fatally shot the intruder, only for it to turn out that the robber's gun was fake. In that case, the concealed-weapon owner was not punished.
But there are also instances in which concealed weapons appear to have saved innocent lives.
On Jan. 22, the day after the movie theater shooting, a pair of concealed-weapon permit-holders prevented what might have been a mass shooting in Columbia, S.C. When two armed men tried to knock over a barbershop, a pair of customers pulled out their weapons and opened fire, killing one and sending the other one scrambling. There were several children inside the barbershop at the time of the shooting, according to WISTV.

Sunday morning appears to have been another instance in which a bystander with a concealed weapon saved an innocent life, albeit by killing an attacker.
Wearing a baseball hat atop his curly white hair and mustache, the customer was sitting in his usual spot near the clerk's counter, sipping his morning coffee, when the masked man burst into the 7-Eleven.
Without saying a word, the attacker slashed at the customer with his hatchet before turning toward the store clerk.
“The guy came in with a mask just swinging the hatchet at both of them,” West told King 5.
That's when the customer drew his pistol and fatally shot the masked man.
The customer was too shaken to speak to media afterward, West said.
Meanwhile, the motive for the bizarre, early-morning attack may never be known. The masked attacker is believed to have been in his 40s, according to authorities. His identity will be released at a future date.
Clarification: The 7-Eleven is located outside of Burien city limits, although Burien Police responded to the incident, a city official said.

With six months to think of a way to improve their group selection format, OnGameNet reached the momentous conclusion to change absolutely nothing. That's right, it's a straight up lottery again.I'll copy and paste my short description from Bacchus 2010:The draw resulted in the following groups...And while the format stayed unchanged, the mood was a little different. All that stuff that happens between the drawings, the delicious fluff that turns an otherwise fifteen minute procedure into a two hour show? This time, it was dreadfully boring.Hiya did his usual bit where he teased Jaedong and Stork for the sake of teasing, but with Sea unusually subdued on the day, it was really a poor showing on the mic overall. Even the normally reliable announcer goading was rather lacking.The flavor bits were kept to a bare minimum, with just three short montages shown between breaks. The most interesting one of them was a five minute clip of the Starleaguers pondering their lives if they had not chosen the path of the pro-gamer, yet it ended up being just a mishmash of audio clips and old school records without any clear insight into any one gamer.The neat, black suit-jackets donned by all the players provided some attractive window dressing, but at the same time served to accentuate the eerie sterility of the occasion.Whereas MBCGame has long since fully embraced reckless impropriety and shameless pandering to the fans as the hallmarks of their group selection (a terrifically amusing affair), OnGameNet has flip-flopped for years on what direction theirs should take. After dabbling with a dizzying three hour marathon of fan-service just a year ago, it appears that 'mostly lifeless' is their new theme.Yet, maybe it's not an entirely bad change of direction. There's no need for the OSL to go out of its way to facilitate fan service at this point in its history, when it has cemented itself as the most respectable and only permanent establishment in e-sports.Creative tinkering is a hallmark of the OSL, so I don't expect this style of group lottery to last into next season. But I venture to suggest that at this point in time, austerity and severity might serve to better improve the OSL's stature than more song and dance.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Radeon GPUs have been gaining popularity in gaming and virtual reality, thanks to the performance afforded by their use of 14nm FinFET manufacturing technology and High Bandwidth Memory, coupled with aggressive pricing. However, the company's High Performance Computing (HPC) products, previously branded as AMD FirePro, have not gained much traction in spite of their double precision floating point performance and support for lots of GPU memory. This is in large part due to the fact that AMD's GPU software (drivers, libraries, etc.) was designed for a Windows environment for workstations and gaming, not for Linux and the server applications that dominate the datacenter acceleration market. But this may be about to change.
Recently AMD began to reposition their newer workstation and presumably future server GPU's as “Radeon Pro”, and has launched a completely revamped Linux software stack to enable AMD to compete with NVIDIA in the fast-growing datacenter markets for HPC and Deep Learning. Note that NVIDIA recently generated $151M in these segments during their latest quarter, over twice the level of a year ago. The new AMD software could pave the way for AMD to gain a foothold in this fast-growing market, although the company must address significant challenges to realize this potential.
What has AMD announced?
AMD is delivering a new software stack called the R adeon O pen C ompute Platfor m , or “ROCm”, to address the HPC and Deep Learning market. Prior to this software release, the prospective AMD customer typically had to port their code to OpenCL, or use C++ with an entirely different approach for parallelizing their application, to run on an AMD GPU. Now, the programmer simply runs his/her CUDA code through an AMD “HIPify” tool to create the Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability (HIP) source code, which can then be compiled using AMD's new HCC (High-Performance Compute Compiler) or NVIDIA's NVCC compiler. The AMD code would then execute on a brand-new Linux driver, called ROCk, which supports a handful of AMD's more recent GPUs. This is a smart approach, as it does not place undue burden on the programmer, and allows him/her to continue to maintain a single source code for both AMD and NVIDIA execution. In addition, AMD is providing a slew of libraries, applications, benchmarks, tools and HSA runtime extensions to ease the transition to their hardware for HPC and Deep Learning.
How Well Does ROCm Perform?
AMD has provided data to demonstrate the performance of the new ROCk driver, compared to the prior Catalyst (Windows) driver. As you can see, the new driver delivers dramatically lower latencies to dispatch compute kernels, a key metric for running GPU parallelized codes. AMD also has provided data showing that the use of the HIP abstraction layer for CUDA codes does not significantly impact performance on either AMD or NVIDIA hardware.
Will this help AMD get (back) into the HPC game?
Well, let's say this software is necessary but insufficient. ROCm provides the needed software for datacenter applications, but AMD's hardware in this space is now lagging behind NVIDIA. Specifically, while the Firepro S series of GPUs compared favorably to NVIDIA Kepler GPUs in double precision performance and memory size when it was introduced in 2014, those older NVIDIA GPUs are being replaced with the new, more powerful PASCAL generation, which also offer High Bandwidth memory at the high end of the product line (P100 with NVLink). And the newer Radeon Pro products, based on Polaris chips, are designed for professional graphics at the time of this writing, not servers. If AMD introduces a Radeon Pro for servers based on Polaris, it would have solid single precisions performance but would likely not provide double precision math and ECC memory needed for many scientific HPC applications. But that might be ok if AMD wants to focus on codes such as seismic analysis or Machine Learning. For the latter fast-growing segment, AMD would need to augment their current GPUs with devices that natively support ½ precision floating point and 8-bit integer arithmetic to compete with NVIDIA PASCAL. So, while AMD has taken two steps forward with their software, they've taken one step back for HPC GPUs from a competitive perspective. We look forward to hearing more about their roadmap beyond Polaris, especially as it relates to support for the specific math operations mentioned above. Even then, the company would need to deploy customer-facing experts and invest in the ecosystem, where NVIDIA already has a strong position.

Što bi, eto, bilo s onim mladićima iz Šibenika, Tisnog i Vodica, što bi bilo s njihovom njujorškom vatrogasnom braćom da su tada, umjesto na Kornatu i Manhattanu, bili na hodočašću u kakvom marijanskom svetištu? Osim što bi, Slava Ocu, danas bili živi? Nije smiješno? Naravno da nije.
Znanstveno je zapravo potpuno neobjašnjivo kako su Hrvati opstali cijelih hiljadu i pol godina. To je bilo prvo što sam pomislio pročitavši slabo vjerojatnu vijest iz Zagreba: tajnik tamošnje Vatrogasne zajednice Damir Vlahović svim je dobrovoljnim vatrogasnim društvima u gradu poslao cirkularni dopis, s izričitom zapovijedi da se 11. rujna svi do posljednjega imaju pojaviti na zavjetnom hodočašću u Mariji Bistrici, jer u protivnom neće dobiti novac iz gradskog budžeta. „Napominjemo da je hodočašće u programu rada Zajednice“, podsjeća se u dopisu, „i da društva koja neće na njemu sudjelovati neće moći sudjelovati u raspodjeli sredstava iz našeg financijskog plana.“
Kako su, naime – to bih volio da mi netko učen objasni - u tamnim dubinama historije zauvijek iščezli neki uistinu veliki i ozbiljni narodi poput Etruščana i Sumerana, Huna i Avara, Hazara i Sarmata, kako su cijele veličanstvene historijske civilizacije i kulture, s razvijenom kulturom, pismom, umjetnošću, filozofijom i nevjerojatnim inženjerskim dostignućima, nestale iz atlasa kao isprane deterdžentom s aktivnim kisikom bez namakanja, dočim Hrvati - narod temeljito nesposoban za samostalan život, što i dan-danas ne umije navodniti njivu uz rijeku, a vatrogascima dijeli opremu po potvrdama od župnika crkve Majke Božje Bistričke – eno i danas stoji nasred karte svijeta, postojano poput tvrdokorne mrlje od gulaša?
Damir Vlahović, recimo, iskreno je iznenađen da je njegov firman nekome uopće neobičan, a kamoli skandalozan. „Stvar je u tome da nam Grad plati trideset autobusa, a pola ih bude prazno jer se ljudima ne da dolaziti. To ostavlja loš dojam, pa smo odlučili da je toga dosta. Takvo ponašanje nije u redu, jer nas Grad financira, a ovo je jednako važna aktivnost kao i sve druge“, mrtav ozbiljan pojasnio je tajnik zagrebačke vatrogasne udruge: „To je samo odlazak u Mariju Bistricu, a nitko ne mora zaista otići na misu. Svi oni koji ne vjeruju u Boga, ili pak vjeruju u nekog drugog boga, mogu taj dan provesti šećući se mjestom, a ne u crkvi. Nije da kažnjavamo one koji ne žele doći, ali ima društava koja ne rade ništa.“
To, eto, mene zanima: kako je moguće da je takav jedan narod - kojemu vatrogascima u opisu posla i redovnih aktivnosti stoji ostavljanje „dojma“ u svetištima i klanjanje drvenim totemima, pa ne dobivaju novac iz budžeta ako se ne pojave na hodočašću – uopće historijski živ? Kako je moguće da takvom veličanstvenom narodu, čijim je vatrogascima molitva Gospi „jednako važna aktivnost kao i sve druge“, i kojemu sâmo zapovjedništvo za vatrogasce što se ne klanjaju kipovima kaže da „ne rade ništa“ – kako takvom narodu nije do sada sve izgorjelo?
Pitate li, međutim, umjesto mene gospodina tajnika, odgovor je jednostavan i savršeno logičan: Hrvate od vatre čuva Majka Božja Bistrička, Kraljica Hrvata. Zašto bi joj se inače vatrogasci morali moliti, zašto bi herojima koji dobrovoljno gase požare i spašavaju ljude obavezna redovna aktivnost bilo i ritualno marširanje u paradnim uniformama oko jednog nevješto izrezbarenog kipa žene s djetetom?
Katolici, naime, imaju osebujan odnos prema vatri. Vas su, na primjer, učili da je vatra „dobar sluga i loš gospodar“, ali katolicima je vatra Božji znak, otvoreni komunikacijski kanal s Gospodinom, nešto poput biblijskog Skypea. Što bi bilo s nama, braćo i sestre, kakva bi nam se povijest pisala da je onoga dana, kad je napasajući ovce na brdu Horebu ugledao „grm sav u plamenu“, Mojsije umjesto Jehove zazvao sinajske vatrogasce? Shvaćate li sad kolika je odgovornost na zajednici zagrebačkih vatrogasaca i njegovu tajniku, kojima valja u trenutku procijeniti je li požar u reciklažnom skladištu željeznog otpada na Jankomiru izbio zbog neispravnih električnih instalacija, ili se to u gorućem skladištu objavio "Bog njegova oca, Bog Abrahamov, Bog Izakov, Bog Jakovljev"?
Mene je, recimo, strah i pomisliti koliko smo Jehovinih poruka do sada izbrisali i pobacali u recycle bin, jer se za svaki gorući grm, šumu, skladište, kuću, automobil ili dalmatinski otok odmah neodgovorno zvalo vatrogasce. Uporno nam se Dragi Bog ukazuje na svom Skypeu, povazdan siromah Jehova vrti i zove, a mi namjestili zvono na zvuk vatrogasne sirene, pa mu sekretarica svaki put javi: „Pretplatnik je trenutačno nedostupan, molimo pokušajte kasnije.“
Trideset autobusa, punih deset tisuća eura platio je stoga iz gradskog sefa Milan Bandić, hiljadu i pol zagrebačkih vatrogasaca bit će 11. rujna u Mariji Bistrici, i eto Gospodinu lijepe prilike da konačno na Skypeu dobije Hrvate. Tajming je vrlo dobar: upravo ovih dana navršava se devet godina od pogibije dvanaest vatrogasaca na Kornatima, koji su životima platili katastrofalnu nesposobnost, neopremljenost i neorganiziranost hrvatskog vatrogasnog sustava – koji, samo podsjećam, otada nije promijenjen - a 11. rujna bit će i točno petnaest godina od onog strašnog utorka kad je u terorističkom napadu na New York u apokaliptičnom ognju od kerozina i rastaljenog čelika poginulo tri hiljade ljudi, i među njima, u najtežoj vatrogasnoj tragediji u suvremenoj povijesti, tri stotine četrdeset i tri vatrogasca.
Što bi, eto, bilo s onim mladićima iz Šibenika, Tisnog i Vodica, što bi bilo s njihovom njujorškom vatrogasnom braćom da su tada, umjesto na Kornatu i Manhattanu, bili na hodočašću u kakvom marijanskom svetištu? Osim što bi, Slava Ocu, danas bili živi?
Nije smiješno? Naravno da nije. Reći ću vam što još nije smiješno: nije smiješno kad država pošalje u smrt trinaest vatrogasaca, i kad je jedini preživjeli zbog toga tuži, pa joj desetak godina kasnije mora platiti dvjesto pedeset tisuća kuna sudskih troškova. Koje će sustav onda proslijediti vatrogasnim društvima što se mole Bogu. To, eto, nije smiješno. Kao što neće biti smiješno kad se sutra ili prekosutra Jehova objavi u nekom plamtećem zagrebačkom neboderu, kad u požaru izgori cijela zgrada zajedno s dvadesetak ljudi, kad istraga ustvrdi kako vatrogasci koji su stigli na vrijeme nisu imali odgovarajuću opremu da spase ljude, kad se potom otkrije kako odgovarajuću opremu nisu imali jer je njihovom dobrovoljnom društvu Vatrogasna zajednica grada Zagreba uskratila financijska sredstva, i kad se na kraju ispostavi da im je Vatrogasna zajednica uskratila novac zato što se 11. rujna 2016. nisu pojavili na obaveznom hodočašću Majci Božjoj Bistričkoj.
Smiješno je, primjerice, kad Željka Markić zatraži izbacivanje Slavenke Drakulić i Marguerite Duras iz školske lektire, a katolički vigilanti ispred hrvatskih crkava dijele brošure o opasnostima Minionsa i tinejdžerskih vampirskih serija: to je smiješno. Smiješno je kad nacionalna televizija u središnji Dnevnik pozove astrologinju da objavi kako predsjednika HDZ-a čuva Dragi Bog. Smiješno je, jebiga, kad načelnik tržišne inspekcije Ministarstva gospodarstva traži povišicu na ime stručne spreme, jer je na Filozofskom fakultetu Družbe Isusove u Zagrebu upravo doktorirao s temom „Utjecaj religioznosti na prometnu kulturu Varaždinske županije“. Smiješno je i kad kardinal Josip Bozanić i biskup Vlado Košić nastupe kao visoki pokrovitelji Prvog hrvatskog kongresa forenzičke ginekologije. To je, da ga jebeš, smiješno.
Još uvijek se računa u smiješno čak i kad Grad Zagreb, dakle prirezni obveznici, daju deset tisuća eura za vatrogasnu ekskurziju u Mariju Bistricu. Sve do tada je, rekoh, barem malo smiješno.
Nimalo, međutim, nije smiješno kad se zagrebačkim vatrogascima zbog izbjegavanja obrednog hodočašća u Mariji Bistrici ukidaju financijska sredstva. Ničega smiješnog nema kad je kriterij za raspodjelu javnog novca – ponavljam: ne crkvenog, ne privatnog, već javnog, dakle vašeg novca – za aktivnosti vatrogasnih društava – ponavljam: ne crkvenih, ne folklornih, već vatrogasnih, dakle spasilačkih društava! – potvrda o sudjelovanju na hodočašću jednom drvenom vjerskom totemu. Ponavljam: ne na vatrogasnoj vježbi, ne na kakvom vatrogasnom natjecanju, već na hodočašću vjerskom totemu!
Ničega smiješnog više nema kad tajnik zagrebačke Vatrogasne zajednice za društva i članove koji ne žele na hodočašće mrtav ozbiljan kaže kako ionako „ne rade ništa“. Pa sve i da ona drvena figura u bistričkoj crkvi zaista ispunjava želje, ne bi Hrvati u ovo doba godine imali mnogo želja povrh one da im vatrogasci ne rade ništa!
Nije to stoga sarkazam, već znanstvena znatiželja: kako je propalo veličanstveno Ptolemejsko Kraljevstvo, koje je izmislilo pneumatsku vatrogasnu pumpu, a još uvijek, dvije i pol tisuće godina kasnije, opstaje narod kojemu se vatrogasci za takvu jednu pumpu doslovno moraju moliti drvenom totemu?
Media reports in Pakistan suggested that Ibrahim's condition worsened after a sudden heart attack
Even as some media reports are speculating that India's most-wanted underworld don Dawood Ibrahim has died after being recently hospitalised, his close aide Chhotta Shakeel told Indian media that "Bhai is fit and fine."
Some media reports in Pakistan suggested that Ibrahim's condition worsened after a sudden heart attack, and that he had been suffering from multiple ailments for some time now.
Talking to Times of India over the phone from Karachi, Shakeel said all the reports about Dawood Ibrahim's death are plain wrong. "Listening to my voice, do you think any such thing has happened? These are all rumours," he said.
According to the NDTV, India has been trying to trace the 61-year-old Dawood for years, wanted for plotting the serial blasts in Mumbai in 1993 that claimed 257 lives and injured over 700 people.
He also faces charges for money laundering and extortion.

President Trump's top United Nations envoy on Thursday accused Iran of violating Security Council bans on weapons transfers, as she stood next to the wreckage of Iranian rockets she said were taken from Saudia Arabia and other battlefields in the Middle East.
“We do not often declassify this type of military equipment recovered from these attacks, but today we are taking the extraordinary step of presenting it here in an open setting,” said Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. “We did this for a single urgent purpose: because the Iranian regime cannot be allowed to engage in its lawless behavior any longer. International peace and security depends on us working together against the Iranian regime's hostile actions.”
Haley spoke to reporters from a hangar at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C., alongside a series of weapons systems that she sourced back to Iran. Most notably, she pointed to a ballistic missile Saudi Arabia salvaged from an attempt to strike King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh. That missile was launched by the Houthis, according to American and Saudi officials, a rebel group in Yemen that is backed by Iran.
“The Iranians are not supposed to be exporting any missiles or any related material,” Haley said. “You will look at all of these weapons and there are markings all over it that show without a doubt these are Iranian-made, these are Iranian-sent, and these are Iranian-given.”
Haley emphasized that the U.N. Security Resolution banning such weapons transfers is the same one that authorized the international implementation of the nuclear deal negotiated during former President Barack Obama's tenure. She used that linkage to set the table for a pressure campaign against Iran — an implicit rebuttal of U.S. allies who see Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal itself as an argument against the Trump administration's aggressive posture.
“This is blatant violations of what they are not supposed to be doing,” she said. “And what we are saying is, everybody has tiptoed around Iran for fear of them getting out of the nuclear deal. And they are allowing missiles like this to be fired over [at] innocent civilians, and that is what has to stop.”
She suggested that Saudi Arabian clashes with the Houthis have prompted western allies to rethink their position on pressuring Iran.
"They all know that this could have hit anyone of their airports,” Haley said. “I think now they realize they can't look the other way any longer, they have to address this.”

The Cleveland Browns plan to start rookie Cody Kessler at quarterback Sunday, but the Redskins believe Terrelle Pryor will take some snaps as well.
Pryor, a quarterback-turned-wide receiver, showed last week against the Miami Dolphins that he can do a little bit of everything. In addition to catching eight passes for 144 yards, he also completed three passes for 35 yards and ran the ball four times for 21 yards and a touchdown.
So the Redskins used a converted receiver of their own to prepare for that possibility, even though Pryor denied this week that he'll be under center against the Redskins.
“I am not in the game plan at QB ‘cause we thought Kessler did a great job,” Pryor said during a conference call. “I haven't had any plays at all so far. This practice coming up, tomorrow is third down and red zone so I doubt I am in the game plan for it.”
Redskins inside linebacker Will Compton chuckled when told of Pryor's remarks, then said, “Yeah, okay.”
So Washington's defense prepared this week to defend a variety of read-option plays and quarterback keepers by having practice squad wide receiver Kendal Thompson run the scout team offense here and there.
“Just anything I can do to help – anything to give the defense that type of look,” said Thompson, a rookie, who played quarterback in college until switching to wide receiver this year in his quest to make it in the NFL. “It hasn't been anything too major, or too extensive. Just a few plays here and there to work. … I try to make quick reads, and with him being a former QB, he has that same mentality of being able to make quick reads and be decisive. So, I've tried to do just that.”
Redskins defensive players have given Thompson a thumbs up for his play at quarterback.
“We know what kind of plays we'll see when No. 11 is in the game at quarterback,” Compton said. “With Kendal being a former quarterback, it's just good because you've got an athlete back there running the plays. When he's running the ball, it helps us get an idea of the types of angles we need to take when approaching him. He's a receiver so he's obviously athletic, and he came out of college as a quarterback, so you know he can throw it just as well as Pryor, too.”
Safety Will Blackmon agreed.
“It's been good. We need someone that's going to make us run,” safety Will Blackmon said. “And when they bring [Pryor] in, they take the quarterback out the game, so it doesn't make sense for us to leave our quarterback in. So they bring in Kendal. [Defending that threat] is nothing crazy, but we have our rules, knowing where we need to be. [Playing Thompson] just helps raise our awareness and prepare us.”
Using human urine can help us work toward a closed-loop fertility system. While not a plant-based technique per se, using their own urine is a way that veganic gardeners can cycle back the nutrients from the foods they consume, while also diverting their urine from the water system where it acts as a pollutant.
Nutrients in human urine
When we eat food, our kidneys filter out excess nutrients that our body is unable to use, and these nutrients are then expelled from the body in our urine. Our urine contains significant levels of nitrogen, as well as phosphorous and potassium. The relative ratios are typically around 11 parts nitrogen to 1 part phosphorus to 2.5 parts potassium. Americans produce about 90 million gallons of urine a day, containing about 7 million pounds of nitrogen. Studies conducted in Sweden (Sundberg, 1995; Drangert, 1997) show that an adult's urine contains enough nutrients to fertilize 50-100% of the crops needed to feed one adult. Rather than importing nutrients for gardening, and exporting nutrients via the toilet, we can help close this loop by keeping our urine in the local food cycle. It can be especially beneficial for fertilizing in city environments where other local forms of fertility may be scarce due to lack of green spaces.
The truth about flushing
The high nitrogen levels in urine are favorable for plant growth, though this can actually pose a major environmental hazard when we flush urine down the toilet into the public water systems. After we flush, part of the nitrogen is removed during an energy-intensive denitrification process. The remaining nitrogen often makes its way to natural waterways, where it can off-balance the ecosystems through a process called eutrophication: the excess nitrogen causes increased algae and aquatic plant growth, and as these plants decompose it depletes the oxygen supply that is needed by aquatic animals, often causing death. So it's preferable to cycle the nutrients in our urine through terrestrial environments rather than aquatic environments, by fertilizing trees, bushes, wildflowers, lawns, and even our gardens.
Is it safe for our health?
Is urine safe to use in our gardens? Pretty much. In healthy populations, human urine is almost always sterile. In the rare cases when it isn't sterile, urine is generally still fine for personal use, or can be stored for several months to minimize pathogen risk. But you don't have to take our word for it: there are detailed resources available that give comprehensive information. The following is intended to be a brief and non-exhaustive overview of health concerns and solutions, though we ask that people do their own research and draw their own conclusions.
Health concerns and solutions:
Avoiding fecal contamination: this is the most important element in the safe use of urine. While pee is almost always sterile, feces contains dangerous pathogens. Make sure that you get a 100% stream of pure urine. Special toilets are available that will separate your urine and divert it into a holding tank, though a simple plastic jug probably works even better to avoid any chance of fecal contamination. You can also store urine in a sealed container for several months to minimize any potential pathogens. (Sidenote: feces can be made safe for gardening through a specific composting process described in the Humanure Handbook, though should otherwise be completely avoided in gardening).
Avoiding illness: If someone has a urinary tract infection, or is using medications, they should avoid using their urine in edible gardens. Though there are still advantages to using the urine on lawns or landscaping, to avoid sending it to aquatic environments.
Individual use: Urine is considered quite safe for individual use. Our urine is probably sterile, and even if it's not, we can't catch anything from our own urine that we don't already have. It's recommended that after applying urine, we wait a month before eating the crops as a simple precaution.
Group use: When mixing urine from multiple people, again, it's probably sterile, though there is more chance of pathogens, especially from accidental fecal contamination. Store the urine for 6 months in a sealed container before using it, and wait another month before eating the food crops as an added precaution.
Being extra safe and socially acceptable: Where safety and social acceptability are concerns for the user, there are a variety of ways of cycling the nutrients from urine. For those who choose to fertilize fruit and vegetable gardens, most people would focus on fruit-bearing crops like tomatoes and cucumbers rather than peeing by the root vegetables. Or, we can fertilize perennial plants like bushes and trees with urine, and later use the plants' leaves in our compost pile or as a mulch, as a very safe and socially-acceptable way to cycle the nutrients back to our gardens. Or, when cycling our urine for environmental reasons, there's no need to add it to our food crops: it can just as easily be applied to non-edible plants, like trees, wildflowers, lawns and landscaping projects.
Container gardens that occasionally receive watered-down pee
Using pee: A how-to guide
Keep in mind that urine is very high in nitrogen. You may need to pee daily, but your plants don't need your daily pee. Choose plants that need lots of nitrogen, such as corn and squash, tomatoes and cucumbers during their fruit-bearing stage, and older plants that need a boost. Signs of nitrogen deficiency include yellow or pale green leaves, and some plants have key signs, like pointed cucumbers. Don't overdo it at the beginning of the season, as excess nitrogen can lead to bushy, leafy plants that bear little fruit. Signs of excess nitrogen include curled leaves, and these plants may also attract aphids. For garden plants in need of a genuine nitrogen boost, once or twice a month is generally fine, though some people will add highly diluted pee a couple of times a week. If you have more pee to give, try your lawn, trees and bushes.
As a basic premise, the urine must be mixed with carbon-rich materials in order for the nitrogen to become accessible to the plants. Carbon-rich materials can include leaves, straw, or just good quality earthy soil. The nitrogen in urine is in the form of urea, creatine, and ammonia; when mixed with carbon-rich materials, the aerobic bacteria convert it into nitrates, which the plants can then uptake.
Here are a few possible ways to use pee in your garden or landscaping. Please read the safety guidelines too.
Recipe 1: Watered-down pee
For soil with good drainage that is crumbly and earthy-smelling. Also works well for container gardens. Grab a reclaimed plastic container and take a pee. Dilute it with eight to ten parts water, and apply it to the soil. Easy peesy. Working the urine into the soil or applying the urine under the top layer of soil would ensure that less nitrogen is lost due to conversion to ammonia gas, and the presence of soil organisms would help neutralize the (rare chance of) pathogens, though just pouring it on the soil works okay too. After applying the pee, water the plant.
Recipe 2: Straight up pee
For soil with a thick layer of carbon-rich mulch, like wood chips and leaf mulch. This is the easiest method. Just pee on the mulch. The mulch will stop the plants from receiving an overly-concentrated blast of urine, as well as helping to break down the nitrogen into a source the plants can use. Peeing between two layers of mulch will lessen nitrogen losses from conversion to ammonia gas.
Recipe 3: Compost pee
Urine can be composted. It's very high in nitrogen, so it counts as a "green" in the compost, and shouldn't be added to a compost bin that is already high in nitrogen-rich materials like food scraps. Be sure to add plenty of carbon-rich materials, like dry leaves, sawdust, straw and cardboard. Urine can act as a starter for a compost, encouraging the decomposition process, such as adding urine to a pile of leaves.
Recipe 4: Straw bale bathroom
You can urinate directly on a bale of straw until the straw decomposes, and this compost can later be added to your garden. We've even met a gardener from Montreal who plants directly in the decomposing straw bales to create a new garden.
Recipe 5: Greywater with a hint of yellow
Greywater is the waste water from showering, doing dishes, etc, and urine can be added to a greywater system. The greywater provides some carbon and significantly dilutes the urine. Ideally this should drain into an aerobic greywater system with natural filters like plants and gravel. Instructions for installing such a system can be purchased from the EcoWaters Project in the guide How to Build a Washwater Garden Plan.
Keep in mind: Urine is high in salt. This is one reason why it needs to be properly diluted. Not all plants respond well to high salt content. Reducing the salt in your diet can be helpful to your own health and improve the salt ratio in your urine.
Is it good for our gardens?
Pretty much. As long as we don't add excessive amounts.
Like all liquid nutrient sources, this shouldn't become the primary form of fertility for our gardens. In natural ecosystems the soil organisms break down organic matter, like leaves and food scraps, and make the nutrients accessible to plants: this is nature's digestive system. Liquid feeds (including urine, compost teas, chemical fertilizers...) bypass this natural system and feed the plants directly, much like a human receiving a liquid diet through an intravenous tube rather than eating lunch. We need to provide the soil organisms with organic matter in order to keep the soil healthy and biodiverse. So in general, liquid feeds should only be used as a complement to other forms of fertility, such as compost and mulch. On the upside, adding a little urine can help activate the decomposition of organic matter, so a wee bit of pee here and there is fine.
Adding too much urine can also affect plant health. Ever see a yellow patch on a lawn because a dog keeps peeing in the same spot? Too much nitrogen; it burns the plant roots. However, the reverse is true, that a lawn that is yellow because of a lack of nitrogen can have green patches where the dog pees. So, in order for urine to be helpful, we need to be observant of our gardens and moderate how much we apply.
Is this even veganic?
Sort of. That depends on how you look at it.
Using human urine isn't a “plant-based technique,” so in its purest form it can't be considered “plant-based growing”. Though, all veganic gardens naturally contain free-living animals, like microorganisms, earthworms, and birds, who eat organic matter and create “micro-manure” as part of their normal daily life. So while veganic growing excludes the addition of waste products from animals that have been bred and raised, humans can be seen as “free-living animals” who voluntarily contribute their waste. This can also help reestablish humans as contributing members of a local ecosystem, rather than separating ourselves (and our bodily waste) through mechanized processes.
Here at the Veganic Agriculture Network, we keep our large countryside garden completely plant-based, to produce veganic food without the addition of any animal products (human or non-human). In the city, we use a little of our urine in our balcony container gardens to provide additional fertility to the plants, and to avoid the occasional flush in a highly urban environment.
Is urine gross? Does it smell?
Despite urine having an “ick” factor in many modern cultures, it's been used throughout history for a variety of purposes, including cleaning wounds, making bread, and in the process of dying clothing. There are even people who drink their own urine on a regular basis. While there are good reasons to be cautious around feces, urine is generally sterile and fine to use for a variety of purposes. To learn more about the history and culture of urine, see Liquid Gold and Life of Pee.
Urine does sometimes smell. There really isn't much problem if you use it immediately, especially if you dilute it. If you choose to store the urine (i.e. to eliminate potential pathogens) keep it in a closed container to reduce the smell. When applying it to the soil, it can help to slightly bury the urine in the soil or under mulch. We've used diluted urine in container gardens on a balcony for quite some time, and the neighbors haven't even noticed.
Is it allowed?
For home gardens it should be fine, especially if you keep it low-key, but what about commercial farms? In some countries urine is accepted in commercial farming, such as Sweden, where it's even applied mechanically to large-scale farms. The regulations vary from country to country, and using human urine could also affect the certification status of a farm. So if you are a commercial farmer, please contact the relevant local services to learn whether urine is an acceptable soil amendment in your region.

Tupac called time on his relationship with Madonna because she was white, it's been claimed.
TMZ has obtained a handwritten letter penned by the late rapper from his prison cell, which is set to go under auction later this month at Gotta Have Rock and Roll with a starting bid of $100,000.
The emotional note, written by the talented California Love lyricist when he was 24 – 18 months before he was gunned down and killed, was reportedly sent to Madonna, now 58, when he decided to end their sexual relationship.
Dated January 15 1995 and written from prison, the Hit Em Up star's letter gave an insight into his relationship with the Material girl singer, then 37.
Appearing to explain why he called time on their relationship, Tupac explained: ‘For you to be seen with a black man wouldn't in any way jeopardise your career, if anything it would make you seem more open and exciting.
‘But for me, at least in my previous perception I felt due to my ‘image' I would be letting down half of the people who made me what I thought I was', the rapper, whose mother Afeni Shakur was an active member of the Black Panther Party activist group wrote, adding: ‘I never meant to hurt you.'
‘Can you understand that?' he added.
In 2015 Tupac's brother Mopreme Shakur confirmed Madonna's claims that the pair had dated, revealing that it began with a ‘passing of a note' during the star's Above The Rim press day in 1993.
But by the time the letter was written in 1995, things had clearly taken a turn between the A-list duo.
Keen to give his side of the story to the apparent breakdown in their relationship, Tupac's note began: ‘I've waited a long time 2 finally write this.
‘Mainly because I was struggling to find all the answers so that I wouldn't leave any unanswered questions.
‘First and foremost I must apologise to you because like you said I haven't been the kind of friend I know I am capable of being,' he said of their relationship.
Appearing to address a public media feud, he continued: ‘An interview where you said ‘I'm off to rehabilitate all the rappers and basketball players' or something to that effect, those words cut me deep, seeing as I'd never known for you to be with any rappers besides myself.
‘It was at this moment out of hurt and natural instinct to strike back and defend my heart and ego that I said a lot of things.'
With another section blurred, the Rose That Grew From Concrete poetry book author continued: ‘Can you feel me?
‘In the time since, as you can see, I have grown both spiritually and mentally.
‘It no longer matters how I'm perceived. Please understand my previous position as that of a young man with limited experience with an extremely famous sex symbol.'
And appearing to want to make amends, Tupac went on to offer an olive branch to the hitmaker.
‘I offer my friendship once again this time much stronger and focused. If you are still interested I would like to further discuss this with you but some of it couldn't wait.'
Proving his caring side, the political rapper added: ‘PLEASE BE CAREFUL MADONNA.
‘Everyone is not as honourable as they seem. There are those whose hearts bleed with evil and envy'.
In an ominous message Tupac, who had previously survived being shot five times, but was gunned down a year and a half after the letter was penned, added:
‘They would not hesitate to do you harm let my five bullets be proof of that!'
‘Ps If there is any information you can share with me regarding Jack and crew please do, it could well be a matter of life and death.
‘Always, Tupac.
‘I don't know how you feel about visiting me but if you could find it in your heart I would love to speak face to face with you. It's funny but this experience has taught me not to take time for granted,' the poet and rapper finished his heartfelt letter with a heart.'
In 2015 Madonna confirmed the duo had dated after being introduced by Do The Right Thing actress Rosie Perez, in an interview with Howard Stern on his SiriusXM radio show.
‘One time I was mad at [Letterman] when I said the f-word a lot, but the rest of the time was good,' she said.
‘I was in a weird mood that day. I was dating Tupac Shakur at the time, and he had got me all riled up about life in general. So when I went on the show I was feeling very gangster.'
Tupac's brother backed this up in a later interview, explaining: ‘She gave me a note to give to him.
‘[I didn't read it,] I was just happy she was giving him a note. Everybody was there, I went over and gave it to him. He was about the business and then they linked up. I would take him to her house and s**t when we got back to L.A. Yeah. They were a thing for a minute.'
A photo taken at a Vogue dinner in New York City the following year shows the Material Girl sitting at the same table as Tupac in 1993.
It's not clear exactly how long the two were together but it was certainly over by February 1995 when he started serving a prison sentence for an alleged assault.
The letter, due for action in mid July, is expected to fetch a sizeable sum.
In 2015 another handwritten letter by Tupac went up for sale for $225,000.
Tupac Amaru Shakur was known by his stage names 2Pac and (briefly) Makaveli.
He sold over 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.
His album All Eyez On Me was one of his biggest hits, including political, racial messages as well as themes around the hardship of inner cities and his life.
However his success soon triggered an East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry, that led to a contentious relationship with The Notorious B.I.G. and the label Bad Boy Records.
On September 7, 1996, Shakur was fatally shot in a drive-by shooting at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas after attending a Mike Tyson boxing match at the MGM Grand with Death Row Records founder Suge Knight.
He was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where he died six days later.
No-one has ever been charged with his murder.

HONG KONG, Feb 26 — China is set to launch a link between gold markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong this year following a landmark stock connect scheme, aiming to enhance its pricing power of gold contracts and ultimately challenge its competitors in the West.
While China is the world's largest consumer of the precious metal, having surpassed India, daily trading of gold in financial centre Shanghai is small compared with London.
The move to develop gold trading comes as more trade flows to Asia and is in line with Beijing's efforts to open up its domestic markets to foreign investors. China wants more market players to use its yuan currency when settling trade contracts and for making investments.
“We will cooperate with the Shanghai Gold Exchange and set up a link this year, making it a platform for market participants in Hong Kong to enter mainland China's gold market,” Chan Sheung Chi, president of Hong Kong's Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange Society said this week.
Chan offered no details on how the gold connector would work, but said the launch time could be as early as in June.
The Shanghai Gold Exchange is the world's biggest physical gold exchange, and all buying and selling of spot bullion in China has to happen through the exchange.
Precious metals and commodities are areas where Beijing has been eager to promote yuan usage, but so far progress has been slow compared to its use for settlement in cross-border trade.
The Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange Society, which was founded in 1910 and has 171 member firms, introduced gold bar contracts denominated in yuan in 2011. China's Bohai Commodity Exchange also launched cross-border spot trading of iron ore and natural rubber in yuan in Hong Kong in 2013.
Potential for the yuan's internationalisation via gold trading is huge as China isamong the largest consumer of many commodities, including coal and copper. Shanghai's pilot free trade zone also launched an international board for gold trading last year.
The push to open up its tightly-controlled markets comes at a time when western regulators are investigating banks over pricing of metals, providing an opportunity for Asian rivals to have a bigger say in commodity pricing.
US officials are investigating at least 10 major banks for possible rigging of precious-metals markets, even though European regulators dropped a similar probe after finding no evidence of wrongdoing, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
London is presently the global benchmark for spot gold while New York is the benchmark for futures prices.
Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, said the bourse had entered into a new era for mutual market access with the mainland and the former British colony should rely on its advantages to make use of this opportunity.
Li expects more market link-ups to follow after the stock connect scheme was launched last November, including for equity derivatives, commodities, international equities, fixed income and currencies.
German exchange operator Deutsche Boerse said last week it aimed to conclude a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with the Shanghai Stock Exchange soon, completing a key element to its Asian expansion plans. — Reuters
Canada's best bathroom is in the place you'd least expect it.
The restroom at the Valleyview Shell Super Station – a massive truck stop in a tiny town about 350 kilometres northwest of Edmonton – has been voted the winner in Cintas' Canada's Best Restroom Contest.
According to the contest website, this unsuspecting loo was awarded the 2010 top honour by Convenience Store Magazine for its geo-thermal heating and cooling technologies.
And with its solid adler wood stall doors, tiled walls and sparkling Victorian style semi-flush mount chandeliers (yes, seriously) this luxurious washroom blows away any horror movie/pornographic movie-type notions typically associated with gas station bathrooms.

“The cleanliness and energy-saving design demonstrates how the staff at Valleyview Shell Super Station goes above and beyond to appeal to their customers,” said Cintas' Senior Marketing Manager Leslie Molin.
“We are excited about the opportunity to present the award to such a deserving establishment and dedicated team.”
According to store manager Blake Sparks, the spotless bathrooms are good for business.
“Customers appreciate that they can count on us for a clean place to stop and use the washroom,” he said in a press release.
“People comment to our staff all the time about our elegant décor in the washroom and the importance we place on the maintenance of our facility.”
The Valleyview Shell Super Station beat out two B.C. restaurants and two Toronto food establishments in the top five.
David Morris Fine Cars Ltd., in Edmonton, was the last Alberta establishment to be honoured with a nomination in 2011, but was bested by a Toronto eatery.
Finalists were selected based on cleanliness, visual appeal, innovation, functionality and unique design elements. Thousands of votes were cast online.
Chick-fil-A: the future of psychology majors—and failed GOP presidential candidates? Photo illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo. Photos by Sean Rayford/Getty Images and Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images.
Only a few months into primary season and the GOP has already identified plenty of scapegoats. Immigrants. Planned Parenthood. Psychology majors.
As Jeb Bush said at a recent town hall, “Universities ought to have skin in the game. … When a student shows up, they ought to say, ‘Hey, that psych major deal … that's great … but realize you're going to be working at Chick-fil-A.”
After bemoaning that “the No. 1 degree program in the country is psychology,” Bush concluded, “I just don't think people are getting jobs as psych majors.”
This is rich coming from the candidate who responded to the Oregon shootings with “Stuff happens” before pivoting to the party line that mass violence is a mental health problem, not a gun problem. So who is going to solve those mental health problems if not psychology majors?
As a psychology professor, I'm biased, but I think psychology majors have more to offer than fast food prep skills. We live in a complex society with challenging problems. The social sciences offer tools to solve these problems.
Take the rising cost of health care. We can debate how it's funded, but one fact is indisputable: Americans today die from different diseases than our great-grandparents did. Every semester, I show my undergraduates a chart juxtaposing the leading causes of death in 1900 and in 2010. A century ago, we were struck down by infectious illnesses like pneumonia and the flu. Today, our top killers are chronic diseases. Cancer. Heart disease. Diabetes. What these diseases have in common is that they're lifestyle-related, which means that behavior matters. Until we develop a wonder drug to cure addiction and eliminate obesity, our most costly health problems are linked with everyday choices. Guess who can understand these choices and figure out how to help people quit smoking, start exercising, and put on sunscreen? Psychology majors.
Psychology majors can also work with patients coping with illness, caregiving stress, insomnia, and chronic pain. My research focuses on the biological effects of psychological stress. We know that children who suffer early trauma show increased risk of alcoholism, heart disease, cancer, and lung disease as adults. In Wednesday night's debate, Mike Huckabee argued that we can cut health care costs by eradicating chronic illnesses. But curing these illnesses isn't just about developing better medication. It's about managing stress and preventing psychosocial adversity. Psychology majors can help us do that.
And it's not just physical health problems that cost society. Depression is the second-leading cause of disability worldwide, resulting in more than 200 million lost workdays each year and costing employers upward of $50 billion. Mental health and substance abuse disorders carry a massive societal burden and are also massively undertreated, with poor and minority Americans receiving the least adequate care. Studies estimate that half to two-thirds of Americans with a psychiatric diagnosis receive zero mental health care. With a treatment shortage that severe, we don't need fewer psychology majors; we need more.
Contrary to what Bush may think, the biggest employer of psychologists isn't the fast food industry, but the Department of Veterans Affairs. As an intern at a VA hospital, I worked with patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, anger management problems, and substance abuse disorders. Psychologists have developed effective behavioral treatments for all of these problems, but waitlists are long. We need psychology majors—not just doctoral-level psychologists, but paraprofessionals at the bachelor's and master's levels—to disseminate and deliver mental health treatments that work.
This week, a video of a police officer body-slamming a South Carolina student went viral. One of the many troubling aspects of this video is the fact that an armed officer was in the classroom at all. Over the last decade, police presence in schools has risen while funding for school psychologists and guidance counselors has declined. It's been reported that the 16-year-old girl in the video was recently orphaned and is in foster care. She could have benefited from psychological counseling, not an arrest record. The incident reflects a costly societal trend of outsourcing mental health care to the criminal justice system. Many inmates have psychiatric diagnoses, and many receive “treatments”—like prolonged solitary confinement—that exacerbate rather than ameliorate these diagnoses. We need psychology majors to help turn the school-to-prison pipeline into a school-to-treatment pipeline. Social science can inform an evidence-based correction system and help us bring mental health care to troubled citizens before they offend.
Jeb Bush's diss on psychology majors may have been offhand. But it reflects a disturbing Republican distrust of the sciences, particularly the social sciences. Last spring, the House passed legislation to cut the National Science Foundation's Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences by 45 percent. And just this month, the House debated a bill that would further hamstring NSF by demanding that its grants be in the “national interest.” Never mind that research spending consumes a minuscule slice of the federal budget. This legislation opens the door for politicians, rather than scientists, to set our national research agenda.
Science and technology education has been in vogue lately, and it's great that we're getting kids excited about engineering and tech. But by glorifying “hard” sciences at the expense of the humanities and social sciences, we're missing out on important bodies of knowledge. Technological innovation moves us forward, but for society to thrive, we also need social workers, preschool teachers, therapists, nurses, guidance counselors, and home health care providers—people who do the hard and often undervalued work of caring for others. Psychology majors can excel in those positions and many others, and Chick-fil-A will have to find its employees elsewhere. After Wednesday night's debate, I can think of least one Republican candidate who will be needing a job.

NEW DELHI: Muslims have the lowest share of working people - about 33% - among all religious communities in India. This is lower than the nationwide average work participation rate of 40%.The figure for Jains and Sikhs stands at 36% each. Buddhists, comprising mostly Dalits who embraced Buddhism in the 20th century, have a high working population share at 43%. For Hindus, the figure is 41%. Drawn from the Census 2011 data, the statistics show a faith-based profile of India's 482 million strong workforce. The figures haven't changed much from the 2001 Census, indicating a stasis in the economic status of communities.The key reason behind low work participation rates in some communities seems to be the low work participation of women. Women's participation is just 15% for Muslims and Sikhs, and even lower at 12% among Jains. Among Hindus, there are 27% working women, while it is 31% for Christians and 33% for Buddhists. Several smaller faiths fall under 'Other Religions'. These are mostly tribal communities from peninsular India and the northeastern states. Their work participation rates are markedly different from other communities. Nearly 48% of members of this section work, more than any of the country's six major religious communities. Women's work participation is also highest in tribal communities, at nearly 44%.Census data also provides a picture of how many are engaged in what kind of work. For the country, 55% of workforce is in agriculture, as cultivators or as agricultural workers. The Census classifies all occupations in industry and services as 'Other', a convention since British times. This makes up 41% of all workers.Only 13% of Jains are involved in agriculture, the lowest for any community.While 41% of Muslims and Christians work in agriculture, this goes up to 47% among Sikhs and to 54% for Buddhists. The highest share of workers involved in agriculture is among Hindus, at 57%.The Jain community is predominantly working in industry and services. Muslims too are largely concen trated in these sectors as are Christians. Muslims are also notably more involved in the `Household Industry' category which is mainly artisanal work like carpentry, black-smithing etc.Among tribal communities classified under 'Other Religions', over 80% of their members are working in agriculture, indicating their poor economic status.
The tax was unpopular. It was reduced to 0% on 1 June 2018. [1] The Government of Malaysia tabled for first reading the Bill to repeal GST in Parliament on 31 July 2018 (Dewan Rakyat). [2] GST was replaced with the Sales Tax and Service Tax starting 1 September 2018.
The existing standard rate for GST effective from 1 April 2015 is 6%. Many domestically consumed items such as fresh foods, water and electricity are zero-rated, while some supplies such as education and health services are GST exempted.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an abolished value-added tax in Malaysia . GST is levied on most transactions in the production process, but is refunded with exception of Blocked Input Tax, to all parties in the chain of production other than the final consumer.
GST was scheduled to be implemented by the government during the third quarter of 2011,[3] but the implementation was delayed until 1 April 2015. Its purpose is to replace the sales and service tax which has been used in the country for several decades. The government is seeking additional revenue to offset its budget deficit and reduce its dependence on revenue from Petronas, Malaysia's state-owned oil company. The 6% tax will replace a sales-and-service tax of between 5–15%.[4][5]
The Goods and Services Tax Bill 2009 was tabled for its first reading at the Dewan Rakyat (the lower house of the Malaysian parliament) on 16 December 2009.[6] It was delayed amid mounting criticism.[7][8][9] The government responded by asserting that the tax on oil income will not be sustainable in the future. National Consumer Complaints Centre head Muhammad Sha'ani Abdullah has said, “The government should create more awareness on what the GST is. The public cannot be blamed for their lack of understanding, and thus, their fears”. Sha'ani says that the GST will improve accounting, reduce tax fraud, and facilitate enforcement of the upcoming Anti-Profiteering Act. Muslim Consumer Association of Malaysia leader Datuk Dr. Ma'amor Osman said the GST could help end dishonest business practices, but expressed concern about how the tax would be applied to medical products and services. A group leading the campaign against the GST, Protes (which objects to the GST because of concerns about its effects on low-income Malaysians), cancelled a planned protest but has stated that they will continue to agitate against the legislation.[10]
During the government reading of the 2015 budget, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced a GST tax of 6% starting on 1 April 2015. This will replace the Sales and Services Tax.[11][12][13][14] Implementing GST tax will be a part of the Government's tax reform program to enhance the capability, effectiveness and transparency of tax administration and management. The GST was implemented on 1 April 2015.[15]
By June 2015, worldwide crude oil prices fell to half its value, with several nations & oil industries considering it a crisis.[16] The income from the newly implemented GST managed to supplant Malaysia's national budget from the deficit induced by a loss in oil tax revenue.[17] On 7 March 2016, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Abdul Halim congratulated the government for implementing GST.[18]
By May 2018, the new Malaysian government, led by Mahathir Mohamad, decided to reintroduce the Sales and Services tax after completely scrapping GST. The GST standard rate has been revised to 0% beginning the 1st of June 2018, pending the total removal of the Goods and Services Tax Act in parliament.[19]

Arsene Wenger has revealed the latest team news ahead of the Watford game at Vicarage Road on Saturday:
on the latest team news…Basically we have the same squad available as last week. I think it will be a similar squad.
on if Giroud could start against Watford…Giroud is still a little fraction behind physically.
on Ramsey and Iwobi…They are progressing well. Will it be immediately after the break [that they are back]? That's what we'll have to see in the next two weeks.
on Gabriel…He's progressing very well. He's ahead of schedule. We said six to eight weeks and we think it could be six.
on Jenkinson…Carl Jenkinson, we plan six weeks from today. He had to do his shoulders as well - sometimes when a guy has weaknesses and he has a big injury, you take advantage of the fact that he has a big injury to sort out the short ones. That's what we did with him. He had the two shoulders done [too]. He went through a tough time, Carl. But he's brave, conscientious, motivated and I think he will come back well.
More polls to follow later in the season!
Last week, a senior Indian diplomat visited the Ontario Khalsa Darbar, better known as the Dixie Gurdwara, in Mississauga, a suburb of Toronto. The occasion was a condolence meet for a senior member of the community who had passed away recently.
Over the past couple of years, Indian officials have been to this particular gurdwara at least thrice. While this may appear a commonplace occurrence, this particular temple, once known to be frequented by pro-Khalistan elements, was long considered forbidden territory for any representative of the Indian government.
Other gurdwaras also thought of as “out of bounds” because they were controlled by hardcore elements have witnessed such visits. The official who was at the Dixie Gurdwara, India's consul general in Toronto, Dinesh Bhatia, has also been to temples in Rexdale, Malton, Scarborough and Brampton.
Ranjit Singh Dulay, secretary of the Dixie Gurdwara, told Hindustan Times, “The gurdwara is open for everybody. We cannot refuse anybody as long as they are coming to pray.” However, he did add people were “upset” after the events of 1984 and its aftermath but following overtures and apologies from the Indian government, “sometimes the relationship starts changing, and people are getting softer”.
While Bhatia did not comment on specific visits, he said, “It is a privilege to receive blessings at Indo-Canadian places of worship. I'll continue to seek support and blessings at religious places important to the community. The cohesiveness of the Indo-Canadian community is visible at these places of worship.”

These forays to temples once aligned to the Khalistan cause is part of an outreach programme undertaken by the government that includes backchannel talks with former Khalistani extremists and pruning of a blacklist.
When Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Canada in the spring of 2015, one of the more significant stops on his schedule was at the Khalsa Diwan Society's historic Ross Street Gurdwara.
While such visits would not have been contemplated even five years ago, when portraits of Khalistani “saints” such as Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale were, at times, prominently placed at some gurdwaras, “time has been a great balm”, as one official put it.
More moderate elements are being elected to gurdwara managements, reflecting the change in the mood. That is partly due to newer immigrants from Punjab having little to do with the Khalistan movement. However, as the number of hardcore advocates of Khalistan has dwindled, those remaining have become more strident.
There are about 40 gurdwaras in the province of Ontario, and of those nearly 30 are in the Greater Toronto Area. The vast majority of these have never been inclined towards the radicals.
The few remaining that have some support for separatists also now appear to be on the path to moderation. Still, the visits by Indian officials so far have been for public events, such as condolence meets, and officials have yet to be formally invited to some gurdwaras.

Prominent Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov on Wednesday was placed under house arrest as part of an embezzlement case widely seen as political.
Serebrennikov was detained by law enforcement on Tuesday and charged with embezzling 68 million rubles ($1.1 million) in government funds as part of the “Platforma” project connected to Moscow's Gogol Center. He faces up to ten years in behind bars.
Serebrennikov was sentenced to remain under arrest until Oct. 19.
Speaking from a cage in the courtroom, Serebrennikov protested his innocence, describing the charges against him as “incredibly absurd and impossible,” according to a Mediazona live feed from the courtroom. He asked the judge not to place him under house arrest, saying it would mean he would no longer be able to work. He added he was not a flight risk since law enforcement had earlier confiscated his passport.
Публикация от babettaspb (@babettaspb) Авг 23 2017 в 4:32 PDT
The crackdown against Serebrennikov began in May when his theater, the Gogol Center, was raided by law enforcement and Serebrennikov was detained by authorities for questioning. He was later named a witness in the case. Three former employees connected to the Gogol Center are also on trial, including an accountant who during a court hearing earlier this month accused Serebrennikov of being the mastermind of the alleged fraud scheme.
Serebrennikov's lawyer called several prominent cultural figures to testify in the director's defense, including director Andrei Smirnov and literary figure Irina Prokhorova, who offered to pay his bail. As Serebrennikov pleaded not guilty to the charges, a crowd of around 200 people chanted “Kirill!”and “Freedom!" outside the courtroom. The crowd included some of Russia's most well-known cultural figures. “This is a two-act performance which has been going on in Russia for a long time,” journalist and prominent commentator Sergei Parkhomenko told The Moscow Times outside the Basmanny Court. "The first act is that everyone is guilty. In Russia anyone who receives state funding is trapped, because it is impossible to comply with all the regulations, and consequently they're hung up by several hooks." "The second act is such that is that any of these hooks can be pulled at any moment, either to exact bribes or to make a political statement.”
Публикация от Darya Orel (@dashulka_eagle) Авг 23 2017 в 3:24 PDT
Ahead of presidential elections next year, many within the upper echelons of Russia's cultural circles see Serebrennikov's case as politically motivated. Serebrennikov is widely believed to have the backing of Kremlin adviser Vladislav Surkov, feeding theories that the director's arrest is also part of an internal power struggle. But many outside the court on Wednesday said the director's arrest was meant to send a broader message. “Those who are opposition-minded are being shown that nothing will save them, whether or not they're famous, talented, stupid, fat,” said Parkhomenko. “The message is: ‘If we want to snack on you, we'll eat you whole.'” Journalist Viktor Shenderovich compared the case to the prosecution of former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was Russia's richest man until he was arrested in 2003 and jailed for more than a decade in a case widely seen as political.

Gigaom, long one of the better sources of technology news, has shut down after running out of money.
Founded in 2006 by Om Malik, "Gigaom recently became unable to pay its creditors in full at this time," according to a statement released by Gigaom management last night. "As a result, the company is working with its creditors that have rights to all of the company's assets as their collateral. All operations have ceased. We do not know at this time what the lenders intend to do with the assets or if there will be any future operations using those assets. The company does not currently intend to file bankruptcy. We would like to take a moment and thank our readers and our community for supporting us all along."
While that statement left some room for interpretation, a personal blog post by Malik indicated that the site won't be revived. "Gigaom is winding down and its assets are now controlled by the company's lenders. It is not how you want the story of a company you founded to end," he wrote.
Gigaom had a lot of great journalists who will have little trouble finding new jobs. In particular, I've always admired its tech policy articles, especially the broadband and FCC coverage by Stacey Higginbotham, who did some of the best writing on how interconnection disputes with Internet service providers can degrade online video quality. Gigaom was one of the first sites I clicked on every morning.
Gigaom is shutting down. The site. And the company. But @om built something amazing and it changed my life. I love him and my colleagues. — Stacey Higginbotham (@gigastacey) March 10, 2015
In addition to journalism, Gigaom had research and events businesses. The company relied on venture capital funding, most recently raising $8 million just over a year ago. Malik left the site a year ago.
"In 2008, our company decided that we would not pray at the altar of pageviews and advertising metrics that do nothing but devalue our readers' time and attention," Malik wrote in a post on February 20, 2014. Gigaom had "more than 70 really smart people" on staff, he noted.
Malik closed that post by quoting the Japanese writer Haruki Murakami (author of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle): "Writing, to me, is the meaning of life. My life became something special because of writing.”
The Mariners' trio of Robinson Cano, Nelson Cruz and Kyle Seager didn't disappoint in their opening debut Thursday, combining to go 6-for-9 with a homer, a double, three RBIs and three runs scored in a 9-4 win against the Padres.
Notable
The Mariners debuted their much-anticipated heart of the batting order with Robinson Cano batting third, Nelson Cruz batting clean-up and Kyle Seager batting fifth. The trio didn't disappoint combining to go 6-for-9 with a homer, a double, three RBIs and three runs scored. Prospect Patrick Kivlehan continued to swing the bat well, belting a three-run homer in the eighth inning to deep left-center. Roenis Elias looked solid in his first start of the spring, pitching two scoreless innings and allowing three hits and issuing a walk. Relievers Danny Farquhar (2/3 inning, one run, three hits), Charlie Furbush (1 inning, two hits, two runs) and Joe Saunders (1 inning, one run, two hits and a walk) all struggled.

Ocala, Florida —The bald eagle—the symbol of our nation—which is protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, faces a new threat in Marion County today.
Michelle Whitfield, head of the wildlife department at the Animis Foundation, said bald eagles and other wildlife are being poisoned, but not how one would think.
The Animis Foundation alleges that the Marion County Animal Shelter has been recklessly dumping euthanized animals at the Marion County Baseline Landfill, which is located next to the shelter.
Whitfield said two years ago when a bald eagle was found nearly dead at the landfill, Animis and Dr. Shannon Kennedy performed a toxicology screen on the eagle's blood. She said the results were disturbing. Test results showed the eagle had been poisoned with pentobarbital, a drug commonly used by veterinarians to euthanize animals.
Pentobarbital is a barbiturate, which slows the activity of the brain and nervous system.
Whitfield said the eagles are eating the dead animals that have been discarded by the shelter; therefore, the pentobarbital is being passed onto the eagles.
Now, residents want to know if the animals are being discarded like trash instead of incinerated. Questions about whether or not the drug could seep into the aquifer have also been raised.
“Animis contacted authorities two years ago when we made the discovery. We were under the impression that Audubon would be testing all eagles and reporting the findings to the Florida Wildlife Service (FWS),” said Whitfield. “Yesterday, I found out that nobody has been testing the birds. All of the proper authorities were notified, but nothing has been done.”
On February 2, 2015, two additional bald eagles were found near death at the Baseline Landfill. The eagles were treated for poisoning. Once stabilized, they would be transported to the Audubon Center for Birds of Prey. This makes a total of 10 bald eagles in the past two years that have been found at the landfill.
Marion County officials released the following statement:
“This afternoon, we were made aware of citizen concerns expressed on social media and via emails regarding two distressed bald eagles found at the county landfill facility on Monday. While bird and eagle sightings are not uncommon at landfills, we don't frequently encounter distressed wildlife at our facility. In these situations, however, addressing the animals' well-being becomes the staff's first priority. On that day, Solid Waste immediately contacted a wildlife rehabilitator licensed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), per FWC protocol. As of today, Solid Waste has reached out to the FWC and the rehabilitator for continued updates. The cause of the eagles' distress is not known or confirmed by any official tests at this time.”
###
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation (FWC), initially, was not involved with this investigation. In fact, the FWC was not even made aware of the situation until February 4, when county officials called the FWC and began to ask questions about Animis.
In an attempt to discredit Animis, the county wanted to know if Animis was associated with FWC, which they are not. Animis is its own licensed entity; however, FWC wanted to make it clear that Animis is on FWC's approved list of wildlife animals rescue rehabilitators. Animis frequently rescues animals for the FWC if an officer with FWC is not available.
Greg Workman, Regional Public Information Coordinator for the FWC said, “Although we are not heading up this investigation, it is a very serious matter. Bald eagles are federally protected; therefore, this case was turned over to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Because it is federal, we felt it would be better serviced if handled by FWS.”
Rumors began to spread through social media the moment Animis posted the story on Facebook, and people quickly began to confuse FWC and FWS, which are two separate agencies. It should be clear that FWC is not the lead in the investigation and was at no point made aware of the situation until yesterday.
Gavin G. Shire, Chief of Public Affairs with FWS, said, “USFWS Special Agents in Florida are conducting a preliminary inquiry with Florida Wildlife Conservation Commission investigators to address this issue.”
In a report published by FWS it states, “Each year a number of bald and golden eagles, other wildlife, and domestic dogs are intoxicated or killed after ingestion of pentobarbital residues in the tissue of exposed euthanized carcasses. Exposure of these carcasses is almost always the result of improper disposal at landfills.”
Ocala Post reached out to the Marion County Animal Shelter and asked what their procedure was for discarding euthanized animals. As always with Marion County officials, Ocala Post never received a reply.
Mara Burger, Public Information Specialist with the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), said, “The proper disposal of domestic animals is covered by Rule 62-701.520(4)(c), which allows disposal in Class I landfills or on the property where they died. Proper disposal is defined as “buried at least two feet below land surface and above the water table.”
The DEP has not yet responded to Ocala Post's questions in regards to whether or not there would be an investigation against the Marion County Baseline Landfill.
Ocala Post also contacted the EPA; we are waiting on a response.
Ocala Post received a formal copy of the results from the toxicology performed on the bald eagles by Andreas Lehner, Ph.D., an Analytical Chemist with Michigan State University. The results stated, “There was a moderate amount of pentobarbital, which fits the presumed diagnosis.”
[Updated February 5, 2015, at 8:30 p.m.]
Ocala Post was notified earlier today that one of the bald eagles passed away. The other is still recovering.
Ocala Post was also contacted by several former employees of the Marion County Animals Shelter that wish to do an interview. Stay tuned for those details.
[Updated February 5, 2015, at 9:32 p.m.]
Marion County Public Information Manager, Barbra Hernandez posted the following on Ocala Post's Facebook page:
“We want to provide you the latest updates regarding the bald eagles located at the landfill facility on Monday. Today, we were able to speak with staff at the Audubon Center for Birds of Prey, who notified us that one of the eagles continues to recover at their facility. Unfortunately, we were saddened to learn that the other eagle did not make it. Audubon Center staff also confirmed that, as of today, no official toxicology tests have been performed. This information was also shared by Dr. Kennedy, veterinarian for the Animis Foundation, with whom we spoke today. Throughout the day, we have received several citizen inquiries regarding the burial of deceased animals at the landfill facility. We know many of you have questions about our Solid Waste and Animal Services policies for handling and properly burying deceased animals. Please know that our departments operate under strict state regulations and county guidelines. We would like to share with you additional information about our practices here: http://marioncountyfl.org/home/showdocument?id=6589.”
How does Solid Waste handle deceased animals at the landfill?
Step 1: Deceased animals are transported (whether by individual, agency or business) to the landfill's inbound scale and reported to Solid Waste staff. Scale personnel notify the operators on the landfill.
Step 2: Operators excavate a hole at least 3 feet or more in depth, exceeding state statute requirements for a hole to be at least 2 feet in depth.
Step 3: The vehicle containing the deceased animal(s) is brought near the excavated hole for depositing. The landfill operator completes the deposit and covers with materials excavated from creating the hole.
Step 4: Operators continue to push and pack materials over the surface until end of work day.
Step 5: On closing, operators cover all areas on which they worked with a 6-inch dirt cover or a tarp, both methods authorized by the FDEP permit.
When a pet owner brings their pet in to be euthanized, the pet owner would have the choice of taking the body of the animal home or allow the animal to be discarded with the trash at the landfill.

After this story went viral, Elaine DeIorio McClain, Public Information Officer for the Marion County Office of Public Information, responded to Ocala Post's information request. However, the response contained information Ocala Post had previously included in the article.
Stay tuned to Ocala Post for updates, as Ocala Post is waiting on further correspondence from FWS.
Traditionally when a bird poops on you that's a sign of good luck. While it might sound strange to some, Catalonia an autonomous community of Spain, has taken this tradition to a whole other level, involving 18th Century customs that involve poo. Like the bird poop theory, Catalonians see poo "as a sign of good luck as it fertilizes the earth and ensures a good harvest for the coming year."
According to Barcelona -- Metropolitan, the "The Caganer" and the "Caga Tió" are two beloved Catalonian traditions. While they might make us laugh and be silly, it's interesting to learn the history of these Christmas traditions.
THE CAGANER
"The caganer is a small, defecating figure associated with Christmas. The caganer is a tradition not only in Catalunya but also in other areas of Spain, Italy and Portugal. The typical Catalan caganer is squatting with his trousers around his ankles; he wears a red barretina and is often reading a newspaper or smoking a pipe.
"The tradition of the caganer is believed to be 300 years old. An Iberian votive offering which depicts a holy warrior excreting has been discovered near Tornabous in the Urgell and can be dated back to the early 18th century. Originally, the caganer was a necessary figure in the nativity scene. He was thought to bring good luck and happiness to the family and his fecal droppings were a symbol of wealth and the promise of a productive new year.
"The caganer today is still often placed within the Catalan nativity scene. Local nativity scenes generally depict the entire town of Bethlehem and the caganer is usually found squatting in an obscure corner.
"The caganer is said to be one of the most popular figures in the Catalan nativity scene. In December 2010, a 19-Foot, 8.22-Inch caganer was placed in the Maremagnum Shopping Centre. This gargantuan figure grabbed the Guinness World Record for Largest Caganer."
According to TIME, "reasons for his existence vary. The BBC has done some serious digging with one local in Barcelona explaining that, "It's typical of Catalonia. Each house buys one for Christmas, I don't know why (we do it), it's just a tradition."
TIME found Joan Lliteras, a "caganer connoisseur," who owns a collection of some 600 caganers as well as being the founder of an association, explained the tradition in more detail.
"There was the legend that if a countryside man did not put a caganer in the nativity scene, he would have a very bad year collecting vegetables," he said, claiming that the figurine is a symbol of fertility and good fortune. "The caganer is never in the front of the nativity scene. That would be a lack of respect. He's always hidden in a corner, under a bridge or behind a tree and every morning the children play a game, hunting for the caganer."
Caganers have become a booming business with an "inevitable celebrity spin-off," TIME points out. Christmas markets sell the likes of politicians, soccer players, foreign presidents, rock stars and royalty. There's one of the Queen of England and another of Presiden Obama, among many others.
THE CAGA TIÓ
"Caga Tió is a much-loved Catalan tradition used to celebrate the Christmas season. It's a log which is often given human physical features, such as eyes, eyebrows, legs and a nose. It's wrapped in a blanket for warmth and is crowned with the traditional Catalan barretina. The whole family customarily comes together before the beginning of the Christmas season in order to create the Caga Tió.
"Caga Tió is cared for by Catalan children in the weeks leading up to Christmas. From December 8th his behind is wrapped in a blanket and he's fed orange peel and turrón (a type of Spanish nougat) every evening. It's thought that the more the Caga Tió is fed, the more presents or Christmas goodies he'll excrete from his behind come Christmas day.
"El Tió needs some persuasion to drop his load on Christmas day and the children of the household are given sticks in order to beat him into delivering his many and various festive offerings. While beating the Caga Tió, Catalan children traditionally sing a song -- the words may vary from town to town but the tune stays the same. A typical version goes like this: 'Caga tió, caga torró, avellanes i mató, si no cagues bé et daré un cop de bastó. Caga tió!' This translates literally as: 'Sh*t log, sh*t turron, hazelnuts and cottage cheese, if you don't sh*t well, I'll hit you with a stick. Sh*t log
Catalonia is an autonomous community of Spain, designated a "nationality" by its Statute of Autonomy. Catalonia comprises four provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona. The capital and largest city is Barcelona, the second largest city in Spain, and the center of one of the largest metropolitan areas in Europe. It borders France and Andorra to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the east, and the Spanish regions of Aragon and the Valencian Community to west and south respectively. The official languages are Catalan, Spanish and Aranese (an Occitan dialect).
Catalonia, which is one of Spain's most developed regions with a population of 7.5 million, has been fighting to be an independent state from Spain.
According to the BBC, the Catalan Government has set a date for when it plans to hold a vote in Catalonia with two questions, the second of which implies, if a majority of people vote "yes", that Catalonia would no longer be part of Spain.
"However, the Spanish Popular Party led-government, as well as the main opposition Socialist Party have already said this can not happen," the BBC reports. "Catalan pro-independence parties, which hold a majority of parliamentary seats in Catalonia, still sound determined to hold the vote, come what may."

The Grand Falls Hospital is one of the first public buildings in New Brunswick, Canada, to utilize a new energy-efficient, pellet-fired heating system.
“I am pleased to see the Grand Falls hospital utilizing a wood-pellet heating system to reduce its reliance on oil and take advantage of a more environmentally-friendly solution,” said Health Minister Hugh Flemming. “This project supports local wood industries and will allow for some significant savings for the hospital in the long term.”
Flemming said building on the potential of biomass and wood-fueled energy solutions was a government commitment, noting the results have been positive for the hospital's new 850-kW, energy-efficient heating system during the first few months of operation.
The new pellet-fired boiler plant was built by Biomass Solutions Biomasse, a New Brunswick company, which responded through a public tender process to construct and operate the unit. Under a renewable energy agreement – public-private partnership – with the province, the company will turn the unit over to the hospital after 10 years.
“Biomass reduces long term energy cost for our provincial buildings and helps to create jobs in our province based on natural resources,” said Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Claude Williams. “This effort will reduce our exposure to the volatility of fossil fuel markets. Biomass is considered to be carbon neutral and reduces emissions as the boilers burn very clean. This fits in well with our Green Building Policy.”
The projected savings are $4 million over a 20-year period for the Grand Falls facility. The plant is projected to reduce annual fuel oil consumption by 300,000 liters while creating an annual locally-produced pellet fuel requirement of 650 metric tons.
“This is innovative infrastructure project and partnership with the private sector is one that the Grand Falls General Hospital is pleased to be a part of,” said the hospital's facility director Nicole Labrie.
Other public buildings are also getting involved in pellet-fired systems including École Marie-Gaétane in Kedgwick. The school boiler was also developed through a renewable energy agreement with Design Built Mechanical Inc. of Charlo for a 15-year term.
By year's end, two new schools and a new nursing home will use the same technology. Southern Carleton Elementary and Centennial Elementary School, currently under construction in the Woodstock area, and Les Résidences Jodin in Edmundston, will also rely on pellet-fired systems. Annual savings are expected to be in the vicinity of $50,000 per school and $82,000 for the nursing home.
Jake McDorman has to become a master hacker in no time flat in the new episode of “Limitless.”
In the episode, Boyle (Hill Harper) learns his former military buddy is accused of murder. The friend blames it on the loss of control of his prosthetic arm, so Boyle asks Brian (McDorman) to help determine if the artificial limb was hacked.
In an exclusive clip of the episode obtained by TheWrap, Brian agrees to help Boyle. There's just one small catch: He has no idea what hacking actually involves.

WHAT goes up must come down. It is natural to assume that the law of gravity should also apply in financial markets. After all, isn't the oldest piece of investment advice to buy low and sell high? But in 2010 European investors would have prospered by following a different rule. Anyone who bought the best-performing stocks of the previous year would have enjoyed returns more than 12 percentage points higher than someone who bought 2009's worst performers.
This was not unusual. Since the 1980s academic studies have repeatedly shown that, on average, shares that have performed well in the recent past continue to do so for some time. Longer-term studies have confirmed that this “momentum” effect has been observable for much of the past century. Nor is the phenomenon confined to the stockmarket. Commodity prices and currencies are remarkably persistent, rising or falling for long periods.
The momentum effect drives a juggernaut through one of the tenets of finance theory, the efficient-market hypothesis. In its strongest form this states that past price movements should give no useful information about the future. Investors should have no logical reason to have preferred the winners of 2009 to the losers; both should be fairly priced already.
Markets do throw up occasional anomalies—for instance, the outperformance of shares in January or their poor performance in the summer months—that may be too small or unreliable to exploit. But the momentum effect is huge. Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton of the London Business School (LBS) looked at the largest 100 stocks in the British market since 1900. They calculated the return from buying the 20 best performers over the past 12 months and then holding them, rebalancing the portfolio every month.
This produced an annual average of 10.3 percentage points more than a strategy of buying the previous 12 months' worst performers. An investment of £1 in 1900 would have grown into £2.3m by the end of 2009; the same sum invested in the losers would have turned into just £49 (see chart 1).
Messrs Dimson, Marsh and Staunton applied a similar approach to 19 markets across the world and found a significant momentum effect in 18 of them, dating back to 1926 in America and 1975 in larger European markets. A study by AQR Capital Management, a hedge fund, found that the American stocks with the best momentum outperformed those with the worst by more than ten percentage points a year between 1927 and 2010 (see chart 2). AQR has set up a series of funds that attempt to exploit the momentum anomaly.
Even the high priests of efficient-market theory have acknowledged the momentum effect. Well-paid fund managers have spent decades trying to find ways to beat the market. But you have to wonder why they bother devoting so much money and effort to researching the fortunes of individual companies when the momentum approach appears to be easy to exploit and has been around for a long time.
Logic suggests that the effect should be arbitraged away. If the best performers of the past 12 months continue to do well, smart investors will buy them after 11 months have elapsed, reducing the returns on offer to those who wait the extra month. In turn, others will buy after ten months, then nine, eight and so on until the effect disappears.
When efficient-market theorists come across a market anomaly, they tend to dismiss it in one of three ways. The first argument is that the anomaly is a statistical quirk obtained by torturing the data; it will not persist. But the momentum effect was noticed in 1985 (by Werner de Bondt, a Belgian economist now at DePaul University in Chicago, and Richard Thaler, of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business) and has not gone away.
The second is that any gains from the strategy will be dissipated in higher trading costs. Clearly, the LBS team's strategy of rebalancing a portfolio every month would be expensive but Mr Marsh says these would not offset an annual performance gap of over ten percentage points.
The third is that higher returns simply reflect the higher risks of the strategy. This has been used to explain away two other notable anomalies: the size and value effects. Small companies tend to do better than bigger ones in the long term, but they tend to be less diversified and therefore more risky. And shares that look cheap on conventional measures (asset value, dividend yield, price-earnings ratio) also tend to deliver above-average returns, but belong to firms that are likelier to go bust.
According to a paper by Cliff Asness, who co-founded AQR, the better performance of momentum stocks is not merely a reflection of higher risk. He finds that the momentum effect persisted even when the data were controlled for company size and value (defined as price-to-book) criteria. Another explanation is needed.
One possibility relates to timing. The efficient-market hypothesis assumes that new developments are instantly assimilated into asset prices. However, investors may be slow to adjust their opinions to fresh information. If they view a company unfavourably, they may dismiss an improvement in quarterly profits as a blip, rather than a change in trend. So momentum may simply represent the lag between beliefs and the new reality.
Once a trend is established, a share may benefit from a bandwagon effect. Professional fund managers have to prepare regular reports for clients on the progress of their portfolios. They will naturally want to demonstrate their skills by owning shares that have been rising in price and selling those that have been falling. This “window-dressing” may add to momentum. Paul Woolley of the London School of Economics has suggested that momentum might result from an agency problem. Investors reward fund managers who have recently beaten the market; such fund managers will inevitably own the most popular shares. As they get more money from clients, such managers will put more money into their favoured stocks, giving momentum an extra boost.
It is hardly a surprise that the momentum effect has been exploited by some professionals for decades. Commodity trading advisers (CTAs), also known as managed futures funds, exist to exploit the phenomenon. They take advantage of trends across a wide range of asset classes, including equities and currencies as well as raw materials. Martin Lueck was one of the three founders of AHL, one of the more successful CTAs, and now works for another trend-follower, Aspect Capital. “Trends occur because there is a disequilibrium between supply and demand,” he says. “The asset is trying to get from equilibrium price A to equilibrium price B.”
Many of the trend-following models were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They were exploited by investors such as John Henry, best known outside the financial world for owning a baseball team, the Boston Red Sox, and a football club, Liverpool (which is on a downward trend of its own). One of the simplest was to buy an asset when the 20-day moving average of its price rose above its 200-day average. In a recent study Joëlle Miffre and Georgios Rallis of the Cass Business School in London found 13 profitable momentum strategies in commodity markets with an average annual return of 9.4% between 1979 and 2004.
Modern CTAs like Aspect and Winton (run by David Harding, another founder of AHL) devote a lot of effort to researching new ways of exploiting momentum. That has sometimes meant trading faster and faster, with a time horizon of milliseconds rather than months. However, not all market movements are part of a trend. Some are merely random fluctuations. “As you trade faster, it is easier to get misled by the noise,” says Mr Lueck. Trend-followers can get “whipsawed” in volatile markets, buying at the top of a short-term trend and then selling at a loss shortly afterwards.
That may be one reason why the momentum effect has not been arbitraged away: it can go horribly wrong. Just as trees do not grow to the sky, share prices do not rise for ever. The effect tends to work for the best performers over the past 12 months, but not for those that have shone for longer periods, say three or five years.
That may be because of another anomaly, the value effect. Investors eventually get too pessimistic about struggling firms, and price their shares too cheaply. That turns them into bargains. Broadly, whereas momentum works over the short term, value is successful over longer periods. The result can be sharp reversals in markets—and nasty surprises for momentum traders. One such turning-point occurred in 2009. Investors who used a short-term momentum strategy, buying the winners of the previous six months, would have lost 46% in the British market and 53% in America, according to the LBS team. Similarly bad years were 1975, 2000 and 2003.
The momentum effect allows investors to get rich slowly. But many fund managers are impatient and thus use leverage (borrowed money) to enhance returns. Such an approach would lose so much money in bad years that clients might lose faith. “To exploit momentum, you need investors who understand the portfolio is going to be subject to a very high level of volatility,” says Mr Marsh of the LBS.
Momentum is so significant in stockmarkets that academics are starting to analyse what role it plays in professional fund managers' returns. This is all part of the long process of removing the “magic” from financial performance. In the early days of fund management, in the 19th century, there were no stockmarket indices. Fund managers could thus claim that a positive return was down to their own brilliance, rather than a general rise of the market, and clients could not tell the difference.
After the development of benchmarks like the S&P 500, clients began to demand that fund managers proved their skill by outperforming an index. Many failed; but even some who succeeded may have done so by holding concentrated portfolios of only a few stocks. Such portfolios were more risky than the overall market. So the next step was to measure the managers' performance after adjusting for risk. Even those managers may have done well because their investment style (value, for instance) was in fashion. So academics started to allow for that, too.
In effect, the portion of the investment return that was purely a result of fund managers' skill was being reduced at every stage. Now, says Mr Marsh, academics are looking to see whether some outperformance is really all down to momentum.
All this analysis matters because these factors can be replicated. These days investors can not only match a benchmark through simple index-tracking funds; they can also own portfolios that exploit the value and momentum effects without paying hefty fund-management fees. The investment-management industry may become even more commoditised.
The momentum effect raises a further important issue. If markets are rational, as the efficient-market hypothesis assumed, then they will allocate capital to its most productive uses. But the momentum effect suggests that an irrationality might be at work; investors could be buying shares (and commodities) just because they have risen in price.
That would help explain why bubbles are created and why professional investors ended up allocating capital to dotcom companies with no earnings and business plans written on the back of a cigarette packet. Momentum can carry whole economies off track.
"SJW" redirects here. For other uses, see SJW (disambiguation)
Social justice warrior (SJW) is a pejorative term for an individual who promotes socially progressive views, including feminism, civil rights, and multiculturalism,[1][2] as well as identity politics.[3] The accusation that somebody is an SJW carries implications that they are pursuing personal validation rather than any deep-seated conviction,[4] and engaging in disingenuous arguments.[5]
The phrase originated in the late 20th century as a neutral or positive term for people engaged in social justice activism.[1] In 2011, when the term first appeared on Twitter, it changed from a primarily positive term to an overwhelmingly negative one.[1] During the Gamergate controversy, the negative connotation gained increased use, and was particularly aimed at those espousing views adhering to social liberalism, cultural inclusivity, or feminism, as well as views deemed to be politically correct.[1][2]
The term has entered popular culture, including a parody role-playing video game, Social Justice Warriors, released in 2014.[6][7][8]
Origin
Dating back to 1824, the term social justice refers to justice on a societal level.[9] From the early 1990s to the early 2000s, social-justice warrior was used as a neutral or complimentary phrase,[1] as when a 1991 Montreal Gazette article describes union activist Michel Chartrand as a "Quebec nationalist and social-justice warrior".[1]
Katherine Martin, the head of U.S. dictionaries at Oxford University Press, said in 2015 that "[a]ll of the examples I've seen until quite recently are lionizing the person".[1] As of 2015 , the Oxford English Dictionary had not done a full search for the earliest usage.[1]
Pejorative use
"the 'social justice warrior,' i.e., the stereotype of the feminist as unreasonable, sanctimonious, biased, and self-aggrandizing." Scott Selisker[10]
According to Martin, the term switched from primarily positive to overwhelmingly negative around 2011, when it was first used as an insult on Twitter.[1] The same year, an Urban Dictionary entry for the term also appeared.[1] The term's negative use became mainstream due to the 2014 Gamergate controversy,[11] emerging as the favoured term of Gamergate proponents to describe their ideological opponents.[1] In Internet and video game culture the phrase is broadly associated with the Gamergate controversy and wider culture war fallout, including the 2015 Sad Puppies campaign that affected the Hugo Awards.[2][5][12][13][14][excessive citations] Usage of the term as a pejorative was popularized on websites such as Reddit,[15] 4chan,[15] and YouTube.[citation needed]
Use of the term has been described as attempting to degrade the motivations of the person accused of being an SJW, implying that their motives are "for personal validation rather than out of any deep-seated conviction".[4]
The negative connotation has primarily been aimed at those espousing views adhering to social progressivism, cultural inclusivity, or feminism.[1][2] This usage implies that a person is engaging in disingenuous social justice arguments or activism to raise his or her personal reputation.[5] Allegra Ringo writes for Vice that "[i]n other words, SJWs don't hold strong principles, but they pretend to. The problem is, that's not a real category of people. It's simply a way to dismiss anyone who brings up social justice."[5]
The term has been used by Rita Panahi to criticize what she perceives as double standards in social justice.[16]
Vice reporter Clinton Nguyen quoted the term during a report which analyzed the aggressive behavior behind 'social justice'-oriented Tumblr users, citing an example in which Tumblr users engaged in sustained harassment towards an artist on the site over the content of the artist's work. The subsequent torment was so vicious that the artist attempted suicide. Users who supported the artist reported at least ten attackers to the police, and led to at least one arrest.[17][non sequitur]According to David A. French, the aims of social justice warriors are opposed to those of the Christian right.[18][further explanation needed]
The term is commonly used by participants in online discussion in criticism of feminism.[10] Scott Selisker, writes in New Literary History, "[Forum participants] often make personal criticisms of what they see as a type: the 'social justice warrior,' i.e., the stereotype of the feminist as unreasonable, sanctimonious, biased, and self-aggrandizing".[10]
In August 2015, social justice warrior was one of several new words and phrases added to Oxford Dictionaries.[1][19][20] Martin states that "the perceived orthodoxy [of progressive politics] has prompted a backlash among people who feel their speech is being policed".[1]
Elizabeth Nolan Brown writes on Reason that proponents of "social justice" on both the left and the right share similarities such as outrage, claims of victimhood, and portraying opponents as bullying and evil and their side as the truly oppressed.[21]
In May 2014, the concept was incorporated into a parody role-playing video game titled Social Justice Warriors.[6][7] Developed by Nonadecimal Creative, Social Justice Warriors involved the concept of debating online against Internet trolls who make racist and other provocative comments by choosing from different responses such as "'dismember their claims with your logic,' rebroadcast their message to be attacked by others, or go for the personal attack."[7] Users were able to select a character class; and gameplay involved changes to user meters of Sanity and Reputation.[7] Game creator Eric Ford explained that the game was designed to foster critical thinking and was not "intended to suggest that racist, sexist, or other offensive comments shouldn't be confronted online. The goal is to encourage critical thinking on how it can be done more effectively, and at less cost to the real-world social justice warriors."[7]

The CEO of a Tennessee company that specializes weapons and tactical training is threatening to “start killing people” if President Barack Obama moves forward with gun control measures.
In a video posted to YouTube and Facebook on Wednesday, Tactical Response CEO James Yeager went ballistic over reports that the president could take executive action with minor gun control measures after the mass shooting of 20 school children in Connecticut last month.
After the Drudge Report likened Obama to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin on Wednesday, pro-gun conservatives expressed outrage over the idea that the White House could act without Congress.
“Vice President [Joe] Biden is asking the president to bypass Congress and use executive privilege, executive order to ban assault rifles and to impose stricter gun control,” Yeager explained in his video message. “Fuck that.”
“I'm telling you that if that happens, it's going to spark a civil war, and I'll be glad to fire the first shot. I'm not putting up with it. You shouldn't put up with it. And I need all you patriots to start thinking about what you're going to do, load your damn mags, make sure your rifle's clean, pack a backpack with some food in it and get ready to fight.”
The CEO concluded: “I'm not fucking putting up with this. I'm not letting my country be ruled by a dictator. I'm not letting anybody take my guns! If it goes one inch further, I'm going to start killing people.”
As The Atlantic noted on Wednesday, gun advocates can stop “freaking out” because Obama cannot ban assault weapons or close the gun show loophole without Congress.
The president, however, can take small steps like modernizing the background check system and limiting importation of assault rifles.
By Thursday morning, the video promising violence in response to gun control measures had been removed from Yeager's YouTube page, but the link had not been removed from Facebook.
Calls to Yeager and Tactical Response were not returned by the time of publication.
Watch this video, uploaded to YouTube on Jan. 9, 2013.
Update (11:15 a.m. ET): Yeager has replaced his YouTube video with an edited version that does not include the threat to “start killing people.” Raw Story preserved a copy of the original threat below.
Watch this portion of the video that James Yeager removed from the original clip, broadcast Jan. 9, 2013.
UPDATE: Yeager uploaded a second video to YouTube on Thursday, in which he advised that no one should do “anything rash.” He added that he didn't “condone anybody committing any kind of felonies up to and including any aggravated assaults or murders.” Watch the video below:
There are some great infographics floating around talking about logical fallacies, like this one, so I'm not going to beat a dead horse talking about strawmen and ad hominem. Instead I'm going to sink my teeth into avery special logical fallacy: Special Pleading.
Special Pleading
Often combined with the appeal to emotion, this is one of the most common justification for bullshit identity politics, used by desperate tumblrites trying to get in on the “oppressed minority” action despite not fitting any of the criteria of a said minority.
Special Pleading for Asexuality
Here I have an excellent example of special pleading from spiritgurgle, who edited and then deleted her very confident post after people started laughing at it:
There is a difference between sexual attraction and sensual attraction. Only main difference is the actual penetrative sex. Like you can look at someone and think “damn I want to get close to naked and touch them without having sex” and still be asexual. Repeat after me:
I AM ASEXUAL ENOUGH AND NO ONE CAN TELL ME OTHERWISE.[…]
Do you see any inconsistencies here? The most basic definition of an asexual person is one who does not experience sexual attraction, which you'd think would go hand in hand with not wanting to have sex. We understand, of course, that sometimes people have sex of curiosity, or to please a partner, but this is something wholly different from repeatedly deciding to engage in sex because you enjoy it and then insisting it's not “sex” because an extremity doesn't enter an orifice.
It's the same contradiction you get when a fervently anti-gay politician is found to be a fan of the D and insists that repeatedly soliciting sex in the men's room and hiring male prostitutes does not make them gay.
It's the same contradiction you get when straight asexuals act entitled to being part of the gay community despite being, you know, straight people who like the opposite sex but don't want to have sex with them.
In theory at least, since many dispute the idea of asexual meaning “lacking sexual interest” whenever they have the chance. By `gurgle's definition, every single person who regularly eats out a lady, engages in mutual masturbation, or humps their partner without an extremity entering an orifice, can still qualify as asexual just as long as they write a philosophical treatise on how it's ~sensual~ attraction and has nothing to do with sex.
When you start to ignore people who want you to never dare question their “definitions” of words, you start seeing other inconsistencies with the asexual label, such as the “gray A” category, which Avenwiki defines as “those who do not normally experience sexual attraction but do experience it sometimes”. Well shit, son. There's a word for people like that; people who experience sexual attraction. You know, those slutty sexuals who make up 99% of the world's population.
Special Pleading for Identifying as Trans*
Special pleading is also a stand-by logical fallacy of transtrenders, an irritating and vocal component of the tumblr “trans” community who claim to be trans despite experiencing no dysphoria whatsoever.
A quick refresher on the definition of trans: this term was created to describe people who were uncomfortable with their sexual characteristics and wanted to transition to the opposite sex. It was later found that this condition developed due to irregular brain development before birth. Trans people's distress can be exacerbated by people expecting them to act as their gender role but this is not the root cause of dysphoria, because an idea of one's gender is not the same as socially-assigned ideas of what men and women should act like.
Transtrenders are individuals who call themselves trans despite not experiencing a persistent feeling that their sex is not quite right. They are typically cross-dressers, people who feel uncomfortable with the social roles imposed upon them or, the most damaging, people who decide that gender is a social construct and they can therefore call themselves whatever they want. Special pleading occurs when such individuals talk about how they love their sexual characteristics, have no desire to transition but will tear into you as cis scum for daring to question their trans identity. In spite of them not actually being trans.
Another wonderful irritant, specific to the FtM community, is people who claim to be lesbian and FtM. Of course, the usual tumblr response is “what do you care what people identify as”? I care because I hate stupid bullshit. The definition of a lesbian is a woman who is attracted to women. The definition of an FtM individual is someone whose gender is male and who unfortunately happened to be born into a female body. A trans man can not simultaneously be both a man and a lesbian any more than a biological man can be a lesbian. To argue otherwise is another example of special pleading, because you are saying “even though this is the definition, I'm right even though all evidence points to the contrary”.
Special pleading, I believe, reeks of entitlement regardless of the person doing the pleading. A lot of people on tumblr are so on board with the idea of “no one can define your identity but you” that they will regularly argue they deserve to be part of X group. When people point out that not only do they not have any reasoning to support their claim, but in fact their experience is in direct contrast to the criteria, they will respond with “I am X and nobody can tell me otherwise”.
The fact remains though, that when you have no grounds to support your claim, all the special pleading in the world won't make you X, Y, or Z.
Following White House press secretary Sean Spicer's comparison of Syrian President Bashar Assad and German Chancellor Adolf Hitler, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called for Spicer to be fired.
“While Jewish families across America celebrate Passover, the chief spokesman of this White House is downplaying the horror of the Holocaust,” Pelosi said in a statement Tuesday.
“Sean Spicer must be fired, and the President must immediately disavow his spokesman's statements,” she continued. “Either he is speaking for the President, or the President should have known better than to hire him.”
During his daily press briefing Tuesday, Spicer said that, in contrast to Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons last week, “you had someone as despicable as Hitler, who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons.”
He clarified later in the briefing that Hitler “brought them into the Holocaust centers, I understand that. But I'm saying that in the way Assad used them, where he went into towns, dropped them down to innocent — into the middle of towns.”
After the briefing, Spicer clarified again, saying in part that he was trying to draw a distinction “of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers.”
As forces loyal to embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad are launching continuing assaults on Aleppo, some fighters in the city have set their sights on a new enemy: croissants.
A religious judicial council in Aleppo has issued a fatwa clarifying that croissants are forbidden under its interpretation of Sharia law, according to a report in Arab daily Asharq Al-Awsat, translated by Al-Arabiya.
The fatwa or religious ruling, a copy of which circulated online, condemns croissants as a symbol of colonial oppression. According to Asharq Al-Awsat, the fatwa specifies that the pastry's "crescent shape celebrates European victory over Muslims."
The ruling appears to have been made by Sheikh Abu Mohammed of the Islamic court Hayaa al-Sharia. Since its establishment, reports Al-Monitor, Hayaa al-Sharia has also investigated people for drinking alcohol and wearing shorts.
The court is one of a number of competing Islamic religious councils that have sprung up to fill the power void in Syria's rebel-held areas, notes the New York Times. Hayaa al-Sharia reportedly received support from Jabhat al-Nusra, the Islamist group du jour that garnered headlines in April after pledging its allegiance to al-Qaeda. According to the Washington Post, the court also enjoys the backing of the fighters of Ahrar al-Sham and the Tawhid Brigade, two of the biggest Islamist rebel organizations in the north of Syria.
The influence of Aleppo's religious courts has grown exponentially in the absence of legitimate government in the city. However, fatwas like the one issued against croissants and an earlier one forbidding women from wearing tight clothing or makeup clash with the city's moderate history, leaving many of its residents uncomfortable.
Are croissants really a symbol of colonial oppression? The supposed link seems to derive from a tale told in a 1938 French cookbook. According to the Larousse Gastronomique, the pastry's crescent shape is a tribute to bakers who foiled a Turkish attack on Budapest in 1686.
But food historians have questioned the validity of the story, noting that the modern form of the croissant was not documented until 1906.
Ireland's newest political party has seen a 25% increase in membership since its launch yesterday.
The launch of Identity Ireland was interrupted by anti-racism protesters in Dublin.
The party is seeking to curb immigration and calling for the return of the Punt, among other measures.
"Yesterday at the start of the day we had 115 members - that's gone up by around 25%," chairman of Identity Ireland Peter O'Loughlin told Newstalk Breakfast.
"We believe Ireland should be a sovereign country in charge of our own affairs, in charge of our border policies, in charge of our monetary policy, and basically running the country in the interests of Irish citizens".
"The EU has become intensely autocratic...the various policies it pursues have done a massive amount of damage to modern Europe".
On the issue of the Euro, Mr O'Loughlin said: "The currency actually needs to be broken up very badly, it's going to end in tears".
On immigration, he said "It's basically a filter system.....you take into account the economic circumstances".
"It's not the level of wealth they have, it's what people can contribute to your society".

Tennessee Titans: Tunsil, Ramsey or Jack?
Despite having the worst record in the NFL last season, the Tennessee Titans are trending upward. Last year, they drafted Marcus Mariota with the No. 2 overall pick and he looked nothing short of spectacular for a rookie signal caller. Tennessee's goal now is to build a viable team around the young superstar so that they can return to the playoffs.
The three players that would help them get there are Laremy Tunsil, Jalen Ramsey and Myles Jack.
Tunsil is the cornerstone left tackle who will protect Mariota for the next 10 years. If the Titans are going to try and build around Mariota, finding someone who can protect his blindside should be paramount.
Ramsey is a catalytic presence in the defensive backfield as he can be extremely productive at any spot on the back end of the defense. For a team that was severely lacking in the secondary, Ramsey would be a wise selection.
Jack is an athletic chess piece that can be utilized in a variety of ways. As a tremendous coverage defender, Jack can play any linebacker spot along with strong safety. Jack would give the Titans a leader on the defense and go a long way toward solidifying it.
Cleveland Browns: Wentz, Ramsey or Bosa?
The Cleveland Browns are a mess right now and this draft will be critical for them in their attempts to turn around the franchise. The best players to help make that turn around are Carson Wentz, Jalen Ramsey and Joey Bosa.
Wentz is probably the No. 1 quarterback on the Browns' board and the quickest way to turn a franchise around is to find an elite quarterback. Wentz has the mental makeup and arm talent to become that type of player for the Browns, which makes him an enticing option at the No. 2 overall pick.
Ramsey would give the Browns an elite defensive back who would significantly improve the back half of the defense for Cleveland. The Browns had a poor defense last year and Ramsey could be a shortcut to making them better.
Bosa is an elite defensive lineman and the Browns have one of the worst defensive lines in the NFL. Bosa could play as a 5-technique defensive end or outside linebacker in Cleveland's base defense while reducing down to a typical defensive end or defensive tackle in nickel.
San Diego Chargers: Buckner or Ramsey?
The San Diego Chargers need a lot of help on the defensive side of the football, which is while they will likely be deciding between two stud defensive players with the No. 3 overall pick, DeForest Buckner and Jalen Ramsey.
Ramsey would be an apt replacement for Eric Weddle and allow the Chargers to still have an elite defender in the deep middle for San Diego. Ramsey is an elite talent who could be a great tandem with Jason Verrett for years to come.
Buckner is a monster on the defensive line and he would be an elite 5-technique defensive end for the Chargers. The Oregon defensive end has the length, strength and hand usage to dominate in a two-gapping system, while also having the ability to win as a pass-rusher in nickel situations.
Dallas Cowboys: Bosa, Buckner, Elliott or Ramsey?
The Dallas Cowboys have a ton of ways that they could go at the No. 4 overall pick. Joey Bosa, DeForest Buckner, Ezekiel Elliott and Jalen Ramsey would all be great selections and make the Cowboys a better team.
The Cowboys have a huge hole at defensive end with the departure of Greg Hardy and Bosa would be a great fit in the Cowboys' scheme. He would give the Cowboys a dominant run stopping defensive end who could put a lot of pressure on opposing quarterbacks.
Buckner would be a versatile chess piece who could play at either defensive end or tackle spot in defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli's defense. He would be able to flourish with the Cowboys and allow them to be extremely multiple with their defensive line looks.
Ramsey would give the Cowboys a great young tandem in the secondary with Byron Jones. He could play at a number of spots in the secondary for the Cowboys, which would allow them to be utilized a lot of different personnel looks.
Elliott would give the Cowboys an elite talent at defensive end and allow them to be the smashmouth team they were in 2014. He would take a lot of pressure off Tony Romo and the defense, while also allowing the Cowboys to run at the highest level.
Jacksonville Jaguars: Jack or Bosa?
The Jacksonville Jaguars have been acquiring a lot of talent as of late and this year they need to continue drafting well if they want to climb out of the doldrums of the NFL.
Myles Jack would give the Jaguars an athletic and talented linebacker who could mask a lot of holes on the defense. The UCLA stud would be able to cover tight ends or even line up against receivers in the slot while also being a dynamic player against the run.
Joey Bosa would give the Jaguars a talented duo of young pass rushers when paired with Dante Fowler. Couple that with Jared Odrick and Sen'Derrick Marks and the Jaguars would have an up and coming defensive line.
Baltimore Ravens: Stanley, Buckner or Bosa?
The Baltimore Ravens were a huge disappointment last year, but that doesn't mean that they aren't a talented team. With a good draft and players returning from injury, the Ravens have a shot to make the playoffs this year.
With the departure of Kelechi Osemele, the Ravens need to upgrade their offensive line. Ronnie Stanely will likely be the best talent left on their board and he will likely warrant consideration. Stanley has elite footwork and would be able to protect Joe Flacco's blindside for years to come.
Bucker would give the Ravens the type of production they have looked for from the five-technique defensive end position for years. Buckner would significantly improve all the players around him, which would make the Ravens defense that much better.
Bosa would make a similar type of impact as Buckner, but he would likely give them more impact as a pass-rusher. Bosa could line up all over that defensive line and be productive from each spot.
San Francisco 49ers: Goff or Jack?
The San Francisco 49ers are in the midst of a full roster upheaval this season as their new head coach, Chip Kelly, installs his schemes and attempts to acquire the personnel that will best fit his team.
It is no secret that Jared Goff would be a great fit with the 49ers. The California quarterback would be able to stay around the Bay Area and his skill set fits Kelly's scheme extremely well. Goff's ability to process information and make accurate throws fits what Kelly is looking for in a quarterback.
The 49ers have been a team that has had elite inside linebackers for quite some time; however, the Chris Borland and Patrick Willis' retirements left them devoid of the type of talent they are used to at the position. Jack would rectify that as he would be a great player next to NaVorro Bowman.
Philadelphia Eagles: Goff, Elliott or Lynch?
The Philadelphia Eagles have a new head coach, Doug Pederson, and they will be hoping to reverse the harm of their least regime this year. Despite the fact that they have allocated a lot of resources to the quarterback position, they may be looking to find a quarterback of the future at No. 8.
Jared Goff would likely be their first choice as his ability to manipulate the pocket and make timely and accurate throws would be a great fit in their offense. Nevertheless, if he is gone, the Eagles may look at Paxton Lynch at No. 8. Lynch would likely need to sit a year, but his arm talent and athletic ability would give the Eagles an elite young talent to mold into their scheme.
If the Eagles decide to go another route, Ezekiel Elliott would be a great choice. With DeMarco Murray gone, the Eagles need a bell cow at running back and Elliott fits the bill perfectly.
Canadian politicians like Kellie Leitch who hope to appropriate the rhetoric and strategy of right-wing populism should understand the real life implications of such an approach.
Donald Trump was successful in employing this scheme for his campaign, but at real cost to his country: the FBI reported a 6.7 per cent rise in hate crimes for 2015 over the year earlier, fuelled by a 67 per cent increase in anti-Muslim attacks.
If Leitch and other copycats want to go down that road, they should be held accountable for doing so.
'Dog-whistle politics'
Michael Chong, one of several contenders running against Leitch for the Conservative Party leadership, was right when he characterized his colleague's new-found obsession with "Canadian values" to be "the worst of dog-whistle politics."
Leitch has been pushing for future immigrants, including those escaping despotism and war, to be "screened" for conformity to "Canadian values."
A screen capture of the electronic survey in which the Kellie Leitch campaign asked its controversial question. (kellieworks.ca) In other words, it's not enough to follow the law of the land. One must also be aligned with the opinions of Kellie Leitch on what it means to be a real Canadian.
Such an absurdity raises the question of how Conservative Party members like Michael Chong — or anyone else, for that matter — would fare if the Liberals constructed such a test today.
Anti-establishment populism
Of course, none of this rhetoric is uncalculated. Leitch's campaign manager is Nick Kouvalis, a long-time Conservative strategist who helped both Rob Ford and John Tory become mayor of Toronto.
He's now widely recognized as an effective employer of the "elites-are-out-of-touch" sort of anti-establishment populism.
Stephen Harper's divisive tactics and ideological emphasis on identity-based wedge issues had finally rubbed Canadians the wrong way by the time of last year's election, but the national and international climate has changed since then.
Donald Trump's presidential campaign was an example of exploiting people's worst fears, Steven Zhou says. (Gerry Broome/The Associated Press) It turns out that there's always room for exploiting people's worst fears, insecurities and paranoia. Certainly U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's victory is the foremost example. He won on a highly nativist platform.
But that was preceded by Great Britain voting to leave the European Union, citing a loss of economic opportunities due to European elitism and unchecked immigration.
Here in Canada, a recent Nanos poll found that 74.9 per cent of Canadians now back plans to screen immigrants who come from the Middle East. A phone survey conducted by the Toronto Star also found that around 67 per cent of Canadians are in favour of screening all immigrants for "anti-Canadian values."
A political regime that fleshes out these populist sentiments with practical policies will take Canada further down the road of racial and ethnic divisiveness.
Exploiting insecurity
These are already uncertain times for many people who are without full-time work and overall economic security. That opportunistic politicians will seek to exploit this insecurity by providing dangerous outlets through identity and anti-immigration politics is par for the course.
But it's an especially dangerous tactic these days, given the emboldened nature of right-wing factions and groups after the Trump victory.
Trump, Leitch and others may not align themselves explicitly with the outlook and rhetoric of controversial right-wing groups, but their cynical campaign strategies often dovetail with the same policy imperatives that hateful right-wingers have used to recently rebrand themselves (hence this whole resurgence of the so-called "alt-right").
And once they see that these politicians can actually achieve victory by emphasizing issues like immigration reform or "lost [insert country name] values," they begin to perceive their own prospects in a more positive light.
And who will bear the brunt of this kind of populism, particularly when the campaigns are over? Certainly not the elite political class to which Kellie Leitch and her cohort remain attached, regardless of how much they deny it.
A flyer posted around McGill University in December. Steven Zhou says minority groups like Muslims, immigrants and refugees will bear the brunt of populist rhetoric. (Andrew Potter/Twitter) It's going to be the Muslims, the immigrants and the refugees who'll be left to weather the storm created in today's post-9/11 climate.
Leitch often tries to bolster her own image in interviews by saying she's for the ordinary, average guy or gal — but that phrase obviously doesn't apply to everyone.
In other words, they're not "ordinary" or "average" human beings if they come from another country or culture.
And if Leitch ends up succeeding in her bid, these vulnerable groups, many of whom are already in the cross hairs of security agencies who operate with minimal oversight, will become more isolated and antagonized than ever.
Defensive position
Journalists have found Leitch either backtracks or assumes a defensive position when asked to specify the exact groups of people she believes are contravening Canadian values.
See, for example, her combative September interview with Macleans, or an interview with Chatelaine in which she dismissed the interviewer's suggestion her screening proposal targets Muslims as "absolute nonsense."
That's because she doesn't want to own up to the full extent of her rhetoric.
Generic 'values'
Nor can she offer a pithy summation of what these precious values are without veering into the amorphously generic: freedom, equality, hard work, tolerance. That's because she doesn't want to pay any real political price for her tactics.
But regardless of how she walks this rhetorical tightrope, Leitch and those who want to take a similar approach must be held accountable for the way they try to galvanize support.

The state Department of Labor is investigating an accident at Zoom Flume Water Park that seriously injured a minister visiting the park with his church youth group.
The Rev. Paul Meador suffered injuries to his lower legs on the 150-foot flume ride last Saturday at the Greene County water park. Meador is pastor of Trinity United Methodist Church in Coeymans Hollow and First United Methodist Church in Dormansville.
The Rev. Jim Moore, the Catskill Hudson district superintendent for The United Methodist Church, posted a note on his Facebook page asking people to pray for Meador.
"Last Saturday Paul took his youth group to a water park and went down a slide for which the landing pool had not been filled," Moore wrote. "With no water to slow him he crashed at full speed into a concrete wall and he has multiple broken bones in his feet, ankles and legs."
Moore said Meador has already undergone two surgeries at Albany Medical Center and has more to come.
"It is expected that he will be there for two or three weeks, and that he will have to use a wheelchair for the next 6 months," Moore wrote.
Denise Kerrigan, owner of the East Durham water park, told the Times Union earlier this week that the ride appeared to be operating properly. Kerrigan, who could not be reached Friday, had said it was a "fluke accident" and nothing like it had happened before.
Kerrigan said the flume has a run-out at the end of the slide and Meador traveled the length of the run-out and hit the wall at the end.
"We feel terrible about this accident," Kerrigan said.
A spokesman for the state Department of Labor confirmed that the accident is being investigated, but declined to comment further, saying it was an active investigation.
Moore wrote in his post "I spoke with Paul this evening, and he is facing this challenge as a man of faith. His churches are supportive, as is his family, but there is a long journey ahead. Please pray for him, his family, and the churches as they make the journey of healing together."

Scrambling for the support of black voters as a crucial primary in South Carolina nears, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont made appeals on Tuesday to corral their backing. Mrs. Clinton used an address in Harlem to propose $125 billion in new spending to reinvigorate poor and minority communities, and Mr. Sanders barnstormed the South, pledging to combat institutional racism and reform police departments nationwide.
With Mr. Sanders trying to cut into his rival's long-held advantages among black voters, Mrs. Clinton, her voice growing hoarse, warned her audience, in a reference to Mr. Sanders: “You know, you can't just show up at election time and say the right things and think that's enough. We can't start building relationships a few weeks before a vote.”
The black vote is likely to make up roughly half the Democratic electorate in the party's Feb. 27 primary in South Carolina, and the two candidates highlighted similar themes in their appeals: the disproportionate economic barriers that young black men, in particular, face and the need to overhaul a criminal justice system that incarcerates young black men at high rates and to work with police forces to prevent officers from shooting black men or singling out African-Americans for arrest.
Mr. Sanders, speaking to students at a town-hall-style meeting at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, said he was tired of seeing “videos of unarmed people being killed by police officers.”
Audio has emerged from Hillary Clinton's private party with campaign contributors, and her tone is just as bitter as her accusations.
This morning, MSNBC aired audio recordings of Hillary's comments to donors in New York City last week.
“Take it from Nate Silver, who's pointed out that swing state voters made their decisions in the final days, breaking against me because he FBI letter from FBI Director Comey,” Clinton said to a few shouts of “yeah!” and a smattering of applause.
“Nate Silver believes, I happen to believe this, that that letter most likely made the difference in the outcome,” she said.
Clinton went on to also blame the Russians, saying the country's alleged hacking of Democratic email accounts stemmed from a “personal beef” he had with her.
“We have to recognize that, as the latest reports made clear, Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyber-attacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me,” Clinton charged.
The MSNBC morning group panned Clinton's accusations.
After stating “a lot of us” have respect for Clinton, “this is a sad way to step off the stage. The Comey letter certainly had an impact in the election in that it reminded voters of what she failed to do for many, many months and that's to address specifically and credibly her email problem,” Mike Barnicle said.
Intel plans to cut five percent of its global workforce in 2014, the company said Friday.
The announcement, first reported by Reuters, comes a day after the company released its fourth-quarter earnings report. That report reaffirmed what we all know: PC shipments are in rapid decline.

Earlier this week, Intel announced that it was halting plans to open its $5 billion "Fab 42" chip factory in Chandler, Arizona. Originally, the facility was to be used for all of Intel's latest and most high-profile chipsets. Instead, the facility will remain vacant and according to the company, "be targeted at future technologies."
Intel has 107,000 employees, so five percent cut equals about 5,300 jobs. In a statement to Reuters, Intel spokesman Chris Kraeuter said that the cuts were "part of aligning our human resources to meet business needs."
Intel has long dominated the PC chip business. However, with slowing sales and continuous quarter-over-quarter drops of traditional computers and laptops, Intel is on the ropes. Its attempts to enter the smartphone and tablet space have been largely unsuccessful, with ARM-based rivals such as Qualcomm and Samsung dominating that market.
There may not be a more charmingly ad hoc tradition than hockey's emergency goaltender. If one of a team's two goalies gets hurt or otherwise incapacitated before a game with not enough time to fly in a backup from the minors, the NHL maintains a list of potential goalies in each city—older guys with careers, probably played a little college hockey, have some connection to the team—who can report and sign at a moment's notice, and, if things go well, get to sit on the bench and never ever get into a game.
The Coyotes' Anders Lindback suffered an off-ice injury hours before Arizona hosted the Canadiens last night, so they went to the rolodex and found Nathan Schoenfeld, 31, whose most outstanding qualification might be that his father-in-law is the team's equipment manager. Schoenfeld got the text message about an hour before puck drop, while he was in the middle of bathing his twin five-week-old boys.
He hopped in the car and made it to the arena in about a half-hour. Along the way he called his father, former Coyotes coach and current Rangers assistant GM Jim Schoenfeld, to ask if New York had any scouts in the stands.
“I said, ‘Well if you do, let them know to check out the backup goaltender tonight,” Schoenfeld said.
Schoenfeld, who works as a bank manager, has been around the team dating back to when his father was coach. Though he skates with the alumni, he hasn't played in an actual competitive hockey game since he last played club hockey at Arizona State in 2006.
“I don't think I'm game-ready but ready in case they need me to sit on the bench,” Schoenfeld said.

He did indeed get to sit on the bench and watch starter Louis Domingue make 17 saves in a 6-2 win over Montreal. Head coach Dave Tippett said he wanted to see if Schoenfeld would chirp players from his perch, like a true backup, but “he was pretty quiet.”
In the locker room, Schoenfeld was awarded the Yotes' championship belt, and Martin Hanzal, after a three-point night, declared him the team's lucky charm. For what will officially go down as an amateur tryout, Schoenfeld will be paid $500 and get to keep his game jersey.

Here's how I'm taking my whiskey this St. Patrick's Day: in homemade vegan chocolate ice cream, with a little kick of orange for good measure. That's so me I'm making myself laugh, but whatever, me! It tastes like those little whiskey-filled chocolates in ice cream form…mmmm…and takes the edge off nicely, too. I'll be finding pots of gold in no time.
When I started brainstorming about St. Patrick's Day recipes, I was mad at myself because everything I wanted to make involved alcohol. Yo dawg, that's racist, I feared. So I consulted my only most trusted sources: my mom, my boyfriend, and the internet, all of which are at least half Irish. The concensus is that everyone's down with St. Patrick's Day being a boozy good time, including actual Irish people in Ireland. So if you're like me, consumed by liberal guilt when you even think of a stereotype, this is good news. We can relax, queue up some Dropkick Murphys and kick back a Guinness and a shot. Or have a bowl of spiked vegan ice cream.
Incidentally, I'm plenty Irish myself. In a plot twist, the verifiably Irish side of my family were anti-drinking, anti-dancing, anti-card playing Protestants, although I have heard fragments about a great-great grandmother who smoked a corn cob pipe.
So how healthy is this ice cream? Not very, but how healthy is whiskey? Also not very, but they're both fun to treat yourself to on St. Patrick's Day. And actually, it could be a lot worse. Vegan, no cholesterol, fairly high in fiber and protein – you don't see these qualities in most school lunches, let alone whiskey-flavored chocolate ice cream. The magic ingredient is tofu, which gets kidded a lot but makes a great base for creamy desserts.
Did you notice the bottle of Jack lurking in my pics? I know, sacrilege, but wait. On St. Patrick's Day everything's Irish, including Jack Daniel's. And speaking of whiskey, if you're hardcore leave out the orange flavoring.
Dark Chocolate, Whiskey and Orange Ice Cream
makes 4 cups
12 oz. extra-firm tofu
2 cups soymilk
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup + 1-2 Tbs Dutch or dark cocoa (or regular cocoa, but then it won't be dark chocolate)
3-4 Tbs whiskey
1 tsp vanilla
1/2-1 tsp orange extract
1/4 tsp salt
1. Combine the first 4 ingredients in a food processor or blender and process until everything's smooth and creamy. Add the remaining ingredients and continue to process until you have a uniform, smooth liquid. Taste it and see if you want to add more of anything. When you have it just like you want it, transfer it to a plastic container and put it in the fridge for a few hours before churning it in an electric ice cream maker. Or, try one of David Lebovitz's methods for making ice cream without a machine. I've yet to try any of them, but David Lebovitz.
2. One you have it churned somehow, enjoy it soft-serve or let it chill for an hour or so in the freezer so you can make firm scoops. It gets really hard after it's been in the freezer for several hours or a day, so pop it into the microwave briefly to soften it up and scoop more.

On sale – J DILLA – GIVE ‘EM WHAT THEY WANT
From Dilla's long-lost (and still tangled) album The Diary, “Give ‘Em What They Want,” 12-inch on clear vinyl with five tracks produced in 2002 by J Dilla and Supa Dave West, on Pay Jay Productions.
Dilla set out in 2002 to record an album collaborating with his favorite producers, and Supa Dave West was among them. The first two vocal tracks on this record are built around the same lyrics – “Give ‘Em What They Want” produced by Dilla and “The Doe” produced by West are typical of how he would re-record a track, changing his delivery to fit another producer's beat.
The last vocal track “So Far,” also produced by Supa Dave West, will be familiar to some fans of MP3 bootlegs. On this record, it's mastered for the first time by Dave Cooley, who worked on Donuts, The Shining and Ruff Draft.

Man stabbed to death in front of his family 'for asking parents of crying child in restaurant if she was okay'
Father Alan Smith, 63, had been celebrating daughter's birthday
Alleged kille r Matthew Quesada, 26, l eft, grabbed knife and tracked him down to second restaurant, court told
Mr Smith's frantic daughter tried to step between her father and the attacker, jury hears
Quesada's mother and girlfriend accused of assisting an offender
Victim: Alan Smith was stabbed in a 'frenzied attack' in a diner after asking if the alleged killer's crying daughter was alright, a court heard
A father out celebrating his daughter's birthday was brutally knifed to death in front of his horrified family just because he asked if a crying child was alright, a court was told yesterday.
Alan Smith, 63, was stabbed at least five times as he sat with his partner, daughter and son-in-law in a cafe in east London.
His alleged killer, Matthew Quesada, became enraged when Mr Smith approached him in the BB Cafe to ask if his young daughter, who was crying, was okay, the jury heard.
Quesada responded 'What's it to you? What's it got to f****** do with you?' before storming out of the cafe.
'Humiliated and angered' by what happened and 'bent on exacting revenge' Quesada, then aged 25, ran to his girlfriend's home to drop off the girl and grab a weapon.
With a knife concealed up his sleeve, He then raced after the family as they entered a second diner - the Roma cafe - where they had gone to eat to avoid any further trouble.
It was there that Quesada allegedly launched a 'frenzied and wordless' attack, stabbing Mr Smith in the head and body.
As Estelle Jenkins tried to get between her father and his attacker, Mr Smith struggled up from the bolted down table before falling to the floor where he kicked out in a vain attempt to stop the onslaught, the court heard.
Quesada only fled when the victim's son-in law Mark Jenkins threw a chair at him, halting the attack, as Mr Smith's horrified partner Denise Facey looked on, the court was told.
As Mr Smith's life ebbed away an air ambulance doctor had to perform emergency heart surgery on a cafe table that formed a 'make-shift operating table.'
He was flown to hospital where he died from his wounds, three of which were fatal.
Accused: Matthew Quesada's mother Victoria Passley-Quesada, left, and girlfriend Maria Brigette are both standing trial alongside him accused of assisting an offender
Quesada, now 26, denies murdering Mr Smith on March 26 last year.
Roger Smart, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey jury Quesada accepts he stabbed Mr Smith and the issue will be his state of mind at the time.
The court heard in the lead up to the alleged murder, Mr Smith was waiting for his family to arrive at the BB Cafe in London's Leyton when Quesada entered with his crying daughter.
After a few minutes when the crying did not subside and while Quesada washed his daughter's hands in the sink, Mr Smith approached to ask if everything was alright with the little girl, it was claimed.
However, the father-of-two reacted angrily and tried to push past a waiter to get into the kitchen but was blocked,
He then tried to use the cafe's phone, but stormed off with his daughter after he wasn't allowed.
The Old Bailey heard that as Quesada went next door to borrow a phone Mr Smith's family arrived.
As Mr Smith told them they would eat elsewhere, Quesada was overheard saying 'I need the piece' over the phone as he stood glaring as Mr Smith and his family left the cafe.
As they walked off Quesada shouted out: 'You see. You? I'll see you.'
Mr Smart said: 'A warning. A man in an aggressive state. A man humiliated, angered by what had happened inside the BB Cafe, bent on exacting revenge.'
'Frenzied attack': Mr Smith's family tried to leap between him and alleged killer Matthew Quesada during the stabbing in Roma Cafe, the court heard The time between the call and the murder was just four minutes, it was said. Minutes later he was seen running after Mr Smith and his family as they entered the Roma Cafe on the Lea Bridge Road where they had gone to eat instead. Mr Smart said: 'He entered only a minute or so after the deceased and his family had sat down in the cafe and approached the table at which they were all sitting. 'Mark Jenkins was facing the door to the cafe and noticed Quesada when he approached their table. Mr Jenkins saw that the defendant had hidden a knife inside the cuff of his sleeve. 'As he got to their table, the defendant leaned across and without uttering a word, lunged at Mr Smith. 'The defendant attacked Mr Smith in a frenzied knife attack, making a plunging motion and hitting the deceased's head and body. 'At this point Mr Jenkins jumped up and stepped away from the table. The defendant repeatedly lunged at Mr Smith across the table hitting him at least five to six times.
Confrontation: The court heard the attack was sparked when Mr Smith asked if the crying baby was alright as he waited to meet his family in the BB Cafe in Leyton
'Mr Smith tried to get out from the bolted down table. He managed to get to his feet and his daughter Estelle Jenkins tried to get between her father and the defendant.
'Mr Smith fell to the floor and kicked out at Quesada, trying in vain to protect himself from the attack.'
Warded off by Mr Jenkins, Quesada was spotted jumping over the back gardens from his girlfriend's flat before getting into a waiting car and speeding off.
A day later Quesada who had shaven off his distinct Afro style hair and changed his clothes was arrested along with his mother Victoria Passley-Quesada inside her car in south London.
He had on him his British passport, flight details for that day's flights to São Paulo in Brazil, along with a holdall.
His mother Passley-Quesada, 54, of Purley, Surrey, is accused of hiding him from the police, looking up flights, and helping him in his bid to escape.
His girlfriend Maria Brigette, 26, of Hibbard Road, Leyton, east London, is accused of updating him on the police investigation. Both deny assisting an offender.
New York state's post-Prohibition craft booze industry is still very much in its infancy. The Farm Distillery Act, passed in 2007, set the regulatory path for small-scale outfits to open up with reduced-price licenses and to welcome tourists into their facilities—provided they sourced half of their raw materials from the state.
Since 2003, when Tuthilltown Spirits became the first distillery to make bourbon in New York since the 1933 repeal of Prohibition, there's been a boom in small-scale distilling outfits from the Catskills to Brooklyn.
The more than 40 distilleries that are now up and running “have already created nearly 200 jobs and buy 1,000 tons of grain from New York farms and lure in a half million visitors clambering through their tasting rooms annually,” according to Edible Manhattan.
Another new, and potentially much larger industry, could wipe out all of that progress, according to Ralph Erenzo, Tuthilltown's cofounder: drilling for natural gas in the massive Marcellous Shale using hydraulic fracturing.
As in Germany, where the powerful, historic brewing industry is warning that natural gas exploration could ruin the groundwater its beer depends on, Erenzo warns that the burgeoning New York spirits industry could be similarly ruined by fracking.
“The single most important raw material the distiller must have at his disposal is water,” he writes in an op-ed in Albany's Times Union. “It makes up a majority of our product and is the source of employment for our 45 employees.”
Erenzo applauds local governments for passing bans and moratoriums on fracking, but he warns that only a statewide ban will protect the natural resource from which he derives his livelihood.
“This time the threat is personal,” he writes. “It's the success or failure of my business and hundreds of craft beverage producers across the state. Pollution of the aquifer and groundwater feeding residential and commercial wells is permanent.”
A federal judge dismissed Sarah Palin's defamation lawsuit against The New York Times on Tuesday.
Palin sued the Times for defamation after an editorial in the newspaper on mass shootings tied an ad run by the former vice presidential nominee to the 2011 shooting of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (R-Ariz.).
"Nowhere is political journalism so free, so robust, or perhaps so rowdy as in the United States," Judge Jed Rakoff wrote in an opinion dismissing the case.
"In the exercise of that freedom, mistakes will be made, some of which will be hurtful to others."
Rakoff found that Palin did not meet the legal standard of proving malice toward a public figure, noting that the paper issued two corrections to the editorial in the hours after it was published.
“Such behavior is much more plausibly consistent with making an unintended mistake and then correcting it than with acting with actual malice,” he wrote.

He also noted that Palin would have to sue the individual responsible for the alleged defamation and not the entire publication, but that her case would still fall short if she had done so."Here, plaintiff's complaint, even when supplemented by facts developed at an evidentiary hearing convened by the Court, fails to make that showing. Accordingly, the complaint must be dismissed," the decision reads."Negligence this may be; but defamation of a public figure it plainly is not."Rakoff, who was appointed by former President Clinton in 1996, is a senior United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.Palin alleged in the lawsuit that the Times falsely accused her of "inciting a mass shooting at a political event in January 2011” and of running a claim it “knew to be false.”Theeditorial had initially stated that Palin's political action committee had run an ad showing Democratic lawmakers faces under crosshairs, when, in reality, the clip depicted their districts, not their faces.The editorial was in response to the shooting at a GOP congressional baseball practice in June that left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) severely wounded.The newspaper issued a correction on the editorial saying the piece "incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords.""In fact, no such link was established," the correction read.
The U.S. Army wants to create a North Cascades training area for helicopter pilots that would include a high-altitude landing site in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area and another within a mile of the Pacific Crest Trail.
Army aviation officials at Joint Base Lewis-McChord want to create a North Cascades training area for helicopter pilots to practice flyovers and high-altitude landings on U.S. Forest Service lands.
The high-elevation mountain training area would extend over an aerial space largely east of the Cascades from around Leavenworth up to the Canadian border.
It would include seven remote landing zones, including one just inside the boundary of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area and another within a mile of the Pacific Crest Trail north of Highway 20.
The new proposal outlined in a scoping document would also include three low-elevation training areas in Southwest Washington.
This would be a significant expansion of the Army's off-base aerial operations in Washington.
Army officials say the North Cascades landing sites would provide vital preparation for operating in Afghanistan or other high-altitude areas where pilots must cope with decreased aircraft performance.
JBLM's high-altitude training is currently done in Colorado.
But Army officials say trips to Colorado are expensive, and the training sites there are often unavailable. So, they want a closer site, according to the document.
The Army document says pilots could fly as low as 25 feet over obstacles in the Washington high-altitude training zone.
The zone would be available for use day and night and all year long. Helicopter units would make up to 75 practice landings in a given month, according to a statement released to The Seattle Times.
The Army's push to create these new training areas follows a Navy plan released last year to have trucks with mobile electronic emitters in the Olympic, Okanogan and Colville national forests assist in training jets for electronic warfare.
The Army proposal, still in an early phase, will be followed by an environmental-assessment study. The Army would request a special-use permit for the landing zones from the Forest Service.
Glen Sachet, a spokesman for the Forest Service's Pacific Northwest region, said his agency will then do its own review.
The proposed landing site just within the eastern edge of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area is likely to get special attention.
“Typically, helicopter landings are not allowed in wilderness,” said Sachet, who said the Army would have to show there are no areas outside the wilderness suitable for the training.
The proposal already has drawn scrutiny from the Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, a watchdog group that has done an initial analysis of the landing sites.
In addition to the Alpine Lakes Wilderness landing site and the one near the Pacific Crest Trail, they found that two sites intersected a mountain bike and motorbike trail, while another was in a wetlands area.
“Our national forests are not some annex of the Defense Department. We think that except for a few sites, they should be off-limits to the military,” said Andy Stahl, the group's executive director.
Army officials say that both training needs and pilot safety were considered in selecting the proposed landing zones. They range in size from approximately 1 acre to 6.5 acres. While they would be used to simulate missions, there would be no refueling, use of live ordinance, troop movements or equipment placed on the ground, according to the Army proposal.
Pilots would train on AH-64 Apache, MH/CH-47 Chinook and MH/UH-Black Hawk helicopters.
Army officials, in the statement released to The Seattle Times, said “adjustments” to the proposed landing zones could occur and that a land-use agreement would have to be reached with the Forest Service.
The Army hopes to produce a draft environmental assessment by Sept. 1.
Through the end of September, the Army would hold public meetings and accept comments on the proposal.
Seattle Seahawks fans celebrate after the Seahawks' earned a trip to the Super Bowl by beating the 49ers.

Seattle, out-of-towners keep telling me, is experiencing a wave of football furor unlike any other NFL market they've ever seen. You can't miss the signs of Seahawks Fever. It's not just the familiar “12th Man” flag on the Space Needle. This week, each construction crane and radio antenna in town is emblazoned in Seahawks colors. Every building in the skyline has installed its own navy and green floodlights, and the effect at night is something like a hand-tinted cityscape from a lost German Expressionist classic. The “emerald city” of the Pacific Northwest has literally become the Emerald City.
Last week, Seattle's venerable alt-weekly, the Stranger, ran a sports page for the first time in its 23-year history. On Saturday, the cast of the Seattle Opera's production of Rigoletto came onstage for a final curtain call dressed in Seahawks jerseys. Today, I ran out to a nearby superstore in hope of finding a Seahawks jacket for my suddenly football-obsessed bandwagon fan of a son. The store had planted a “12” in its floral arrangement out front; a crowd was taking pictures. Inside, they had been completely sold out of Seahawks-wear for more than a week. This town of mild winters and mild-mannered computer engineers is suddenly more sports-obsessed than any icy Rust Belt football fortress.
And why not? A Super Bowl appearance would be cause for celebration anywhere, but in Seattle, sports success is a particularly rare blossom. In recent years, MLS' Seattle Sounders and the WNBA's Seattle Storm have had some success, with the Storm even winning a few titles. But the last professional championship for a Seattle team in one of the four major sports was the SuperSonics' 4–1 win over the Washington Bullets in the 1979 NBA Finals. Before that, you have to go back to the Seattle Metropolitans, a regional hockey club that won the Stanley Cup in 1917. I was a North Seattle kindergartener when the town won its last championship. It's the first real news event I remember. This year, I turn 40.
Seattle can't claim the longest championship drought currently running in America. In Cleveland, 2014 will mark half a century of abject failure. San Diego, for its part, hasn't won squat since 1963. But Seattle often winds up atop lists ranking cities' sports futility, because our long decades of mediocrity have been punctuated with occasional moments of hope—always followed by bitter, soul-crushing disappointment. Also, the Sonics no longer exist. Clevelanders can at least take consolation in the fact that they still have their terrible NBA team. Hooray?
Consider the Seattle Mariners. As a child I often went to see the lowly Mariners play in the Kingdome, led by future non-Hall-of-Fame “stars” like Alvin Davis and Harold Reynolds. Usually the M's lost, and even if they won, you still had to spend a few hours in the dreary concrete Kingdome, the major league ballpark that most closely resembled an airport parking garage. Only the arrival of Ken Griffey Jr. and one well-timed double by Edgar Martinez saved the team from a mid-'90s move to Tampa. Six years later, the team was a legitimate contender, winning a record-tying 116 games and briefly making believers out of fans—until they lost the pennant in five games to the New York Yankees. Even more demoralizing for Seattle fans: The series was held a month after Sept. 11, 2001. For the only time in history, America was actually cheering for the Yankees.
The Seahawks finally made it to the Super Bowl in 2006, their 30th season in the league, only to lose to the Steelers on account of some forehead-poundingly iffy officiating. (Years later, the ref apologized for those bad calls. Thanks, we appreciate that.) The Sonics flirted with greatness from time to time after that 1979 championship, but lost in the NBA Finals in 1996 to a 72–10 Bulls team. The team is now situated for fantastic long-term success … in Oklahoma City. The NBA allowed the move in 2008, while refusing to OK a similar deal to move the Sacramento Kings to Seattle five years later. The sports gods are capricious, especially when they are David Stern.
I myself am a product of the sturm und drang—and the inevitable heartbreak—of Seattle sports fandom. You learn quickly never to hope for too much or to celebrate too soon: The specter of eventual futility lies on the other side of every small victory. Expectations must be managed. When I went on Jeopardy! in 2004, my only goal was not to be That Guy, the one with negative money who gets booted before Final Jeopardy. Even after the first win, I expected to lose every subsequent game. This is the kind of psyche you get up here, molded not only by the annual six months of drizzle, but also by the sub-.500 memories of Harold Reynolds and Jim Zorn and Rashard Lewis. Only in Seattle could an NFL team take the field to the pathos-filled violins of “Bitter Sweet Symphony,” as the Seahawks do, and have everyone understand.
Given Seattle's famous climate, local weather forecasters have had to coin a word for non-dreary interludes: they are “sunbreaks.” When the rain stops and the clouds lift even for a few hours, locals pounce. Offices empty; parks fill up. It's the upside of bracing for misery: Any ray of hope, no matter how transient, is a cause for celebration. That's what I think about when I see school buses full of Marshawn Lynch jerseys and scowling Seahawks logos fashioned out of Post-its on high-rise windows: We are enjoying a sunbreak. And who knows? We're not supposed to hope, but maybe this is the team that ends the heartache. Maybe, after almost 40 years, the clouds are finally lifting.
Two Kotaku sources have added more credence to the rumor that the next Xbox, expected to battle the PlayStation 4 in late 2013 or early 2014, will be an always-online system, though it will be able to tolerate dropped connections.
"Unless something has changed recently," one of the sources told us over email, "Durango consumer units must have an active internet connection to be used."
Durango is the codename for the next-gen Xbox.
"If there isn't a connection, no games or apps can be started," the source continued. "If the connection is interrupted then after a period of time—currently three minutes, if I remember correctly—the game/app is suspended and the network troubleshooter started."

The PS4 will not require an online connection to start or run games, Sony has confirmed. No gaming console ever has.
Reporting about the next-gen Xbox is still mostly a matter of checking rumors and leaks. No one in or out of Microsoft is authorized to discuss the console publicly. But there are a growing number of people tied to the gaming industry, including our sources for this story, who have had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with Microsoft's plans for the machine. Development of games for the console is intensifying. Microsoft has sent beta development kits, sporting a new controller and Kinect motion/voice sensor array to game creators. Our main sources for this story have a perfect track record in getting these kinds of things right.
Advertisement
That said, a caution and a caveat: other sources familiar with the codenamed Durango console have told us that they are still unaware of any Microsoft plans regarding an online requirement. No one has been able to say it's not true and some have speculated that this is required at the operating system level and therefore isn't something Microsoft has to tell all developers or retail partners. Microsoft also has the ability to change this type of requirement seemingly at a moment's notice through changes in firmware or networking infrastructure.
Microsoft doesn't comment at all about its next-gen system, so the best we have from them on the matter is as follows: "We do not comment on rumors or speculation. We are always thinking about what is next for our platform, but we don't have anything further to share at this time." That's from a Microsoft spokesperson after we asked, today, about this always-online rumor and told them this story was planned.
Advertisement
But if Microsoft is about to walk this back, they probably haven't done so yet. One of our sources says that the always-online plan was in effect as recently as two weeks ago.
The always-online rumor has been swirling for about a year. We'd been hearing it but couldn't nail it down with the specificity we have today. We raised it as a possibility, tied to a good source, but were unclear how dropped connections would be handled. We also weren't clear if this was something like Microsoft's anti-used-game system, a plan the company briefed partners on in 2012 but that we had heard so little of since that it may well have gone away—or if this was like the plans for the new Kinect, which, it has become increasingly clear, is an essential element of the Durango.

An always-online requirement would obviously be a big deal. It raises many questions about how the system would perform in places that don't have reliable Internet and about the extent that the connection would be used to authenticate ownership of games. This is something every gamer would want to know about. So, since we first heard about it, we have tried to confirm whether the requirement was real and in the cards. Sources in development, publishing and retail mostly responded with shrugs.
In January, the hacker SuperDaE began sharing with me official development documents for the next-gen PlayStation and Xbox. Many of the dozens of pages of the Xbox/Durango documentation were full of programming code but the parts in plain English—the parts that, honestly, we could understand—said nothing about an online requirement. They were, however, crystal clear about the new system needing the new Kinect to operate: "Every Durango console ships with a Kinect sensor. A Kinect sensor must be attached and configured for the console to function."
Advertisement
Some sources told us that they believed that the Durango development kit required an online connection so that Microsoft could keep tabs on them and update them with new, ever-evolving firmware. Others weren't sure.
A few weeks ago, we heard from one reliable industry source who told us about a Durango developer making a game that would use an always-online connection for gameplay purposes, to constantly be able to share game data back and forth. It wasn't clear, though, if this indicated the Durango's capacity to be always online—Nintendo's Wii had its own optional 24/7 always-online mode—or if the online connection was a must.
Meanwhile, the site VGLeaks, which appeared to have access to many of the same Durango documents shared with Kotaku by SuperDaE posted a new document that appeared to indicate an online connection was required for the console. It referred to an "Always Online, Always Connected" console, the better to give users current content and quick access to their entertainment, without waiting for updates or for the machine to boot up. We were unable to confirm this document's authenticity, but the major gaming website IGN reported that they confirmed that it is real. The gaming magazine Edge has also reported that their sources say the next Xbox will require an online connection.

The new confirmation we've heard from sources, including the specifics about how the Durango would handle a dropped connection, bolsters our confidence that all this smoke is a sign of some fiery facts.
But why would they do this?
Every person we've talked to about the always-online connection, internally and externally, has been incredulous. They predict a fiasco. They detect hubris in a Microsoft riding high off of the Xbox 360's incredible post-Kinect sales performance. But they also detect, as I have, an intensified interest in Microsoft's part to position the next Xbox as an entertainment device, to not emphasize games as significantly as they had with past Microsoft consoles. Add that to far shakier rumors of the next Xbox working as a cable box or DVR or some other TV-viewing enabler—something not a single source of mine could confirm—and you might wonder: if my cable box always has to be connected, why not my next Xbox?
Advertisement
There are reasons for Microsoft to not do this, of course. They merely need to see the disastrous launch of EA's always-online SimCity and decide whether the negative backlash of selling people a product that can't work when the servers go down is worth it—especially if the earlier version of that product didn't require that kind of Internet connection.
They could also look at the competition and imagine a consumer standing at a store, deciding whether to buy a PS4 or the next Xbox. One wouldn't require online; the other, if our best sources are right, would. Surely, some would prefer the system without the online requirement.

As mentioned above, things can change. Microsoft may reveal its next Xbox this month, in May or, at the latest, at E3 in June. We'll know more then. We'll hopefully know what they've decided.
ExxonMobil drew tough questions and skeptical responses from a federal judge on Thursday as it urged her to shut down two state investigations into whether the oil giant misled investors and the public about climate change risks. The judge's inquiries suggested the company had failed to build a strong enough case to halt the probes.
U.S. District Judge Valerie E. Caproni pressed Exxon's lawyers to demonstrate how the investigations by the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York are politically motivated efforts to suppress its free speech, as the company claims.
"I can expect you to come forward with something that doesn't require wild leaps of logic," she told Exxon's lawyers.
The two attorneys general, Eric Schneiderman of New York and Maura Healey of Massachusetts, have asked the judge to dismiss Exxon's lawsuit. Caproni gave them until Dec. 21 to file additional written arguments. Exxon will then have until Jan. 12 to respond.
Caproni's tough questioning of Exxon and the tight schedule for the parties to argue the legal points of dismissing the case suggest the judge is close to reaching a decision, said Tom McGarity, a University of Texas law professor who has been following the case.
"It's hard to say she is sending a direct signal about what side she will rule for," he said. "But it sounds like she wants this resolved quickly and that she'll seriously consider a motion to dismiss."
Investigations into What Exxon Knew
The hearing in a Manhattan court was yet another step in the nearly two-year battle by Exxon to thwart investigations into how the company represented its understanding of the risks climate change poses to investors and potential investors. The time frame in question includes the years when Rex Tillerson, now U.S. secretary of state, was Exxon's chief executive. (News reports today suggest Tillerson could be pushed out as secretary of state in the coming weeks.)
Caproni heard arguments in April and has been reviewing hundreds of pages of written arguments submitted by the attorneys general and Exxon. The case had previously been handled by a Texas judge who transferred it to New York earlier this year.
The legal battle began in the wake of an investigative series of stories, first by InsideClimate News and later by the Los Angeles Times, that disclosed Exxon was aware through its own scientific research of the consequences of climate change as early as 1977.
Melissa Hoffer, chief of the energy and environment bureau for the Massachusetts Attorney General's office, said during the hearing that it was these investigations that helped bring Exxon to her office's attention.
The two attorneys general have focused their investigations on how the company informed investors about the impact of future climate regulations on Exxon's oil and gas reserves—estimates of the amount oil and gas it will be able to profitably extract in coming years.
Exxon's Free Speech Argument
During the hearing, Caproni repeatedly asserted that the attorneys general have every right to probe whether the company committed fraud by failing to adequately disclose climate change risks. She also cast doubt on Exxon's attempts to frame the investigation as a political witch-hunt.
"The attorney general of New York is a political animal," she said. "He's entitled to act like a political animal."
Much of Exxon's argument rested on a March 2016 press conference in New York where Schneiderman announced the formation of a coalition of attorneys general under the banner AGs United for Clean Power. The intent of the coalition was to hold Exxon and the fossil fuel industry accountable for contributing to climate change.
Exxon has argued that Schneiderman and Healey's participation in the press conference and coalition show they are biased against the company. It claims they are abusing their power to punish Exxon because they disagree with the company's climate change positions.
Caproni, pressing Exxon on that free speech argument, noted the company's current support for action on climate change. "Your client currently accepts the existence of climate change," she said, citing its support of the Paris climate agreement and a carbon tax. "What speech are they trying to suppress?"
Exxon attorney Justin Anderson told Caproni the company could have legitimate differences about the causes and severity of climate change. He said discussions of those differences were being suppressed by the attorneys general.
Much of the hearing centered around this question, with Caproni pressing Anderson for an explanation of why the investigations should not be allowed to proceed and then, at times, mocking his responses.
"If they're wrong, they don't have a case," she said. "If they're right, then Exxon should be held to account."
Alexis Sánchez was at the heart of a dressing room bust-up after Arsenal's away win against Burnley last month and the tensions between the forward and some of his team-mates – which have simmered for some time – were laid bare during the club's victory at Crystal Palace on Thursday night.
Sánchez was involved in a well-documented confrontation with Laurent Koscielny at Arsenal's training ground last March, on the eve of the visit to Liverpool – a game for which Sánchez would be dropped – and the divisions in the team were there for all to see in the 3-2 win against Palace.
Alexis Sánchez fires Arsenal to victory over Crystal Palace at the double Read more
Sánchez scored twice but five of his outfield team-mates did not celebrate his first goal with him. The refuseniks were Koscielny, Héctor Bellerín, Sead Kolasinac, Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere. Sánchez appeared to gesture in surprise at the lack of celebrations around him. When Sánchez scored his second, Koscielny did not move from his spot inside his own half. The rest of the team did follow Wilshere – who had made the goal – over to the away enclosure where Sánchez was celebrating.
The Burnley flare-up on 26 November was not physical but it involved Arsenal players calling out Sánchez over what they have come to consider as his bad attitude. He was told in no uncertain terms that the team were tired of his on-field histrionics; the way he sometimes whirls his arms in frustration when things go wrong.
Sánchez, who had scored the only goal of the game at Turf Moor from the penalty spot, argued he was merely trying to help his team-mates but it was put to him that the best way to do so was through encouragement. It is fair to say Sánchez took issue with that.
The 29-year-old, whose contract expires in June 2018, was desperate to leave the club last summer and he was on the brink of a £60m move to Manchester City on transfer deadline day. But Arsenal failed to close a deal for Monaco's Thomas Lemar and they pulled the plug on Sánchez's switch because they would not sell him without having a player to replace him in the lineup.
Arsène Wenger believed Sánchez would re-focus for the final year of his contract; that his ferocious will to win would overtake his other concerns when he stepped on to the field. The manager also hoped that the prospect of a World Cup with Chile at the end of the season would serve as additional motivation. Sánchez was heartbroken in October when his country failed to qualify.
Sánchez has scored eight times for Arsenal this season and he was excellent at Palace in a game that his team had to win. But his form has been up and down and it has been a constant topic of discussion at Wenger press conferences.
Jack Wilshere ‘sure' of new Arsenal contract after Arsène Wenger talks Read more
Some of his team-mates have grown weary of him and, as it has become obvious to them that he will not re-sign at Arsenal, they feel it would be better for all parties if he was sold. City still want him and the question is whether they will move in January or wait until the summer, when he will be available for nothing. Paris Saint-Germain have also been credited with an interest in him. Wenger's position is he expects Sánchez to honour the remainder of his contract, although that could change if City, PSG or anybody else made an offer for him in January.
Thierry Henry, the former Arsenal striker, said on Sky Sports after the Palace game that it was clear to him there was a rift among the players. “There is a division in the team,” Henry said. “He [Sánchez] is asking them to come and celebrate. ‘Why are they not coming? Don't you want to celebrate?'
“I don't know what the situation is there but usually when your team scores, you don't look at who scores. If you start to think: ‘Shall I go, shall I not go?' – there's something we don't know exactly what's happening. What I'm trying to say is you're not here for Alexis Sánchez, you're here for Arsenal. Arsenal scored, go and celebrate. I noticed it [Sánchez's gesture]. Sanchez made me notice it. It was like he thought he was alone.”
Henry's fellow Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness said: “It's a divided dressing room. Some of them are not having Sánchez and his situation. I think it's clear. I think it tells you there's a dynamic going on in that dressing room that would suggest it's not well.”

That Apple TV Refresh Is Coming Next Week
Nope, Apple didn't show off new Apple TV hardware yesterday.
And Apple didn't talk about new software for its Web video box, either. But it's still coming.
People familiar with the company's plans said that Apple TV is scheduled for an internal overhaul on Sept. 18, the same day Apple releases its iOS 7 mobile operating software.
The one new feature I'm aware of is a tweak to Apple's AirPlay system. I didn't do a great job of explaining this before, so here's another stab: The new software will allow people who have purchased content from Apple's iTunes store to play that stuff on other people's TVs, via its AirPlay system.
The key part is that they will be able to tell an Apple TV box they don't own to stream the media they do own, directly from the cloud. That's a change from the current system, which requires users to download stuff to their iPhones and iPads and fling it to the TV from there. It also echoes the way Google's new Chromecast device works.
Hope that makes more sense.
I had thought Apple might have talked about this yesterday, but Tim Cook and company didn't mention Apple TV in any way.
You might assume that this means they don't think the software overhaul is significant. Or you might argue that they didn't want to spend much time discussing anything besides their new phones. Note, for instance, that iTunes Radio, which is also in the works, didn't get any stage time. (Correction: Thanks to several of you who pointed that iTunes Radio did in fact get a brief mention yesterday.)
Back in 2011, my partner Brad suggested that USV invest in a search engine called DuckDuckGo.
I laughed at the idea, “why would we ever want to compete with Google?”
“Because they do something Google will never do”, Brad explained.
That thing was private search, no storage of search history, no storing of personal information.
DuckDuckGo was doing about 100,000 searches a day when we had that conversation.
Last week, they had a day in which over 20mm direct searches were done.
That's 200x growth over the six plus years we have been invested in DuckDuckGo.
Brad was right, of course, and I saw that pretty quickly as did everyone else at USV and we made that investment.
And I'm very glad we did.
I suspect I've told this story a few times now at AVC.
I love it so much.
CORRECTION: Meryl Streep's “We're all Africans, really” comment was a direct response to a question about Arab and African films, not a response to questions about the Berlinale Film Festival's all white jury, as the article and headline originally suggested. A recording of the panel shows that Streep's original comments were misrepresented in subsequent reports.
At the panel, a reporter from Egypt spoke about how the festival had a film “representing Tunisia, the Arab world and Africa in the main competition” and followed that up with a question for Streep: "How do you see this part of the world? And is it easy for you to understand that culture? And are you following any of the Arab movies?”
This was Streep's response.
“Yes, in fact I've just seen a film called Theeb, which I loved. I saw Timbuktu recently … I don't know very much about, honestly, about the Middle East, and yet I've played a lot of different people from a lot of different cultures. The thing that I notice is that we're all, there is a core of humanity that travels right through every culture. And, after all, we're all from Africa originally. We're all Berliners, we're all Africans, really."
Our original story appears below. The post first appeared with the headline Meryl Streep's diversity: 'We're all Africans, really'
Ask Meryl Streep about diversity, and she'll give you a rather curious answer.
"We're all Africans, really," the three-time Oscar winner said on Thursday, in response to an inquiry about the all-white panel at the Berlin International Film Festival. Streep is serving as the festival's jury president this year.
She added that the festival is determined to include "all genders, races, ethnicities, religions." Its 2016 jury is made up of seven white people: actor Lars Eidinger, British film critic Nick James, French photographer Brigitte Lacombe, British actor Clive Owen, Italian actress Alba Rohrwacher and Polish director Malgorzata Szumowska.
"This jury is evidence that at least women are included and in fact dominate this jury, and that's an unusual situation in bodies of people who make decisions," Streep said. "So I think the Berlinale is ahead of the game."
An Egyptian reporter also asked Streep if she "understood films from the Arab world and North Africa," according to AP. Though she doesn't know much about the area, she says, "I've played a lot of different people from a lot of different cultures."
"There is a core of humanity that travels right through every culture, and after all we're all from Africa originally," she said. "Berliners, we're all Africans, really."
Okay, Meryl.
Diversity has been a major issue in Hollywood as of late, especially concerning this year's Academy Awards. Only white actors were nominated for Oscars, with mostly white nominees in other categories as well. Celebrities like Lupita Nyong'o and Ava DuVernay spoke out against the nominations, while Jada Pinkett and Will Smith vowed to boycott the awards show altogether.
by Theodore Dalrymple (November 2014)
A kind friend of mine, knowing my interest in such matters, recently sent me a little book containing a collection of inscriptions found in second-hand books collected by a diligent anthologist, a man called H. B. Gooderham. The books were not, on the whole, precious old volumes but rather cheap and relatively recent paperback editions, many of them in rather scruffy condition. Nor were the inscribers famous persons, nor even identifiable. They were, rather, Everyman.
In his brief introduction to the book, the anthologist says that:
… the overriding emotion evoked by these inscriptions is one of pathos. At their most basic level all are records of human connections – or at least attempts at human connections – given added poignancy by the fact that all have been discovered among the shelves of second-hand book shops and, for whatever reason, are no longer in the hands of the original dedicatees.
I am wholly in agreement with this: there is nothing quite like an inscription in a book no longer owned by the dedicatee to capture the melancholy, the bittersweetness, of the passage of time, to recall us to our own mortality and to remind us of the vanity of so much of what preoccupies us.
I love looking at the inscriptions in my books, for they are also a powerful stimulant of my imagination. Of course they raise questions that now cannot be answered, but it would be a dull world in which every question could be answered. For example, I have an edition of Julius Caesar which was published after the MGM film version of 1953, in which Marlon Brando played Mark Antony, James Mason Brutus, John Gielgud Cassius, Deborah Kerr Portia and Greer Garson Calpurnia. It was published with schoolchildren in mind, and the preface says something that I doubt would be permissible in a schoolbook nowadays:
On the stage and screen Shakespeare's influence is as profound today as when he lived: profound because in this world of joy and sorrow man disobeys Divine Law. Shakespeare the teacher shows us in his 14 tragedies how, when the PRIDE of Coriolanus, the Jealousy of Othello, the REVENGE of Hamlet, the GREED and WEAKNESS of Macbeth, the LUST of Antony, the short-sighted IDEALISM of Brutus, etc., are allowed to dominate man, unhappiness, unrest, and often war result.
Sir John Gielgud, the great actor, provided an introduction to the play, though I am not sure how keen personally he was on the Divine Law, in which he describes actors' difficulty with the play, especially when performed in Roman dress:
The classical costumes, though becoming and graceful to players of fine physique, can be ridiculous and hampering to men who are too short, too tall, too thin or too fat. There is always the danger of the effect of a lot of gentlemen sitting on marble benches in a Turkish bath.
That is an image that I shall treasure for ever.
The inscription in the front of the book was in a cultivated hand of the kind that I wish I had, but that it is too late in life for me now to learn (I other words, I don't want it enough). The inscription was dated 21 February, 1957 was signed John. I entertained a brief hope that the John in question might be Gielgud himself, but after a brief search on the internet I found a specimen of Gielgud's handwriting, and it bore no resemblance to that in this book. I will never know who John is – or was, most likely he is no longer with us.
The inscription was as follows:
To Ted – wishing you great success and realisation of your ambition.
I know who Ted most likely was, or is, for the page is embossed by a stamp: Library of Edward C. Raeburn. Nothing came up on an internet search for that name, and it seems to me likely that it must be at the least 70 years since his birth, probably more, for no one would have given the book to a boy less than 13 years old. John's hand is that of an adult, and in the England of 1957 (and John was English, since he spelled realisation with an s rather than a z), mature men did not address themselves to young people by their first names. I suspect, then, that Edward C Raeburn was born considerably more than 70 years ago.
What was his ambition, and did he realise it? Was it connected to the theatre or films? Did he want to be an actor or director? Surely no one would give the script of the film version of Julius Caesar to someone who wanted to be an electrician or an airline pilot? If Edward C Raeburn wanted to be something in the theatre it is most likely that he failed, except possibly at the lowest level, or else he would be findable on the internet; and most people, after all, do fail in their ambition if they have one at all.
Is failure in ambition failure in life? Is success in ambition success in life? I love failures: and to me a failed actor, one who spends much of his career out of work and is impoverished, is a much more attractive figure, and possibly a more interesting one, than an actor who achieves stardom. Success by his own lights is apt to make a person pleased with himself and therefore not an interesting interlocutor. The man who knows he has not achieved as much as he ought is a better companion.
But to return to my little book sent me by my kind friend: one of the lessons it teaches is that one should never inscribe a book intended as a gift with a poem of one's own, for it is sure to be bad and probably pretentious, ridiculous in the eyes of anyone other than the person one wishes to impress with it. Bad poetry fulfils a social function, of course, for reading bad poetry is an easy way to learn to appreciate good poetry; but still the rule holds that if you feel a compulsion to inscribe a gift with poetry, it is best to quote someone else's.
Declarations of love found in books are particularly poignant, especially when they were written comparatively recently. Here is one written less than five years before the book was published:
To my darling Husband – We have now been married for 6 very special months. Enjoy memories of our wonderful honeymoon as you read this.
The book in which this was inscribed was Death on the Nile, by Agatha Christie, not perhaps the most auspicious of choices of book for such an inscription, since the story is of murder on honeymoon.
Why did this book appear for sale only a few years after the inscription was written? I hardly dare think that life had imitated art. Perhaps the wife of the darling husband had died tragically of natural causes, and he had found this reminder of her too painful to bear: but I doubt it. He surely would have kept the book in those circumstances. Perhaps he rather than she had died and the wife found memories of him too much to bear, but again I rather doubt it. Much more likely, because more commonplace, is that the marriage failed and the couple separated in acrimony, the darling husband being only too eager to dispose of reminders of his mistake (his new girlfriend wouldn't have liked reminders of his previous liaison).
Actually, there was a graphological clue to the instability of the marriage. Graphology is not, any more than is physiognomy, an exact science, but one feature of female handwriting that I have found a useful if not invariable sign of emotional instability is an i dotted with a circle. The hand of people who do this is generally rounded and childish. I have a clear picture of young women who dot their i's with little circles. They are pretty in a rather common way, their hair tends to be blonde, naturally or not, and they wear a lot of mascara and other cosmetics round their eyes, and in general they do not have a light hand with their makeup. They are friendly and jolly, inclined to exhibitionism, but their emotions are shallow if intense. I imagined Anita, the signatory of the inscription, who signed her name with a little circle above its i, as such a one.
The saddest of the inscriptions was written in a more cultivated hand, ‘To my dearest Sonia,' on the flyleaf of an edition of The Arabian Nights that dated from 1997.
We've had our own 1000 and 1 nights of marriage – more or less. Three years already! I still discover things about you I love each day or rediscover: your constancy, your generosity, your sense of justice. I count myself a happy man to have found you, and I hope it lasts as many years as we can count. I love you. Tom
Who, reading this, can remain unmoved by the sadness its discarding suggests? A human tragedy is implied in a few words, even if we can never know what exactly it was.
One inscription was of sociological moment. It was in a book with the ominously slushy title of Forever:
Dear Claire,
This has got to be a teenage classic! So to a 40 year old from another heres [sic] to forever being a teen.
much love
Nat
Xxx
Ominously again, the signature was decorated with a little heart, pathognomonic (as we doctors say of a sign that invariably points to a particular illness) of emotional kitsch.
What was most interesting in this, I thought, was the idea that being forever a teenager is something that would be desirable. We all regret our youth as we grow older, and increasingly live in the past, but that is not quite the same as actually wanting to return to adolescence. When I think of my past, it is more with regret than with longing, that I did not use my opportunities better, that I made choices that even at the time I knew to be wrong. If youth knew, if age could, is the old French expression, and it is right.
The Peter-Pan-ism expressed in this inscription is something new. I would have said that somebody might make a fortune if he could produce the elixir of eternal adolescence, except that it is not necessary, for our culture does it for us. It keeps us immature. First comes precocity, then arrested development.
The figure of the ageing rock star is interesting though not inspiring. When one sees pictures of these seventy year-old adolescents one is torn between repulsion and pity. Their faces are canyoned by age and, but with their uncompromisingly youthful hairstyles, dress and comportment, they look like revenants in a budget horror film, as if they have just brushed the clay of the churchyard in which they were buried from their face and body. There are more and more people in our streets who look like this but who have never been rock stars; we grow older as a population, but not with acceptance, let alone grace.
Adolescence, it needs hardly be said, is an age of bad taste, when all that is garish and meretricious attracts, and all that is subtle and meritorious repels. To make of adolescence the state in which one wishes to remain is to wish upon the world the permanent triumph of the kitsch, the shallow and the gimcrack. And accordingly, the adolescent sensibility is one that prevails in much of the art world, where the most adolescent of goals, transgression, is still aimed at. Shock the parents, épater le bourgeois, such is the golden rule.
The problem is that the parents have long since refused to grow up and the bourgeoisie has long since decamped to Bohemia. It is hardly surprising that so much artistic production now has all the freshness of last week's bread, for few are so conformist as rebellious youth.

To most of us, Alief means “Little Saigon,” the area along Bellaire Boulevard, roughly from Highway 6 to the Beltway, filled with many of the city's best Vietnamese restaurants. But the neighborhood is more eclectic than that label would imply, offering everything from Malaysian to Hawaiian food.
Fish cakes, made fresh every day, are the backbone of this restaurant's small menu. The eponymous item, bun cha ca, is a fish cake–noodle soup made with sweet chicken broth and sharpened with fish paste and chile oil, which burns the diner's lips with each bite. The chefs show off with three types of meaty fish cakes in each bowl, along with a motley collection of veggies.
Meat and seafood lovers rejoice at the selection of stews and fried flesh that changes every day on this loaded buffet. Cross your fingers that there's kare-kare, a rich stew of pork hocks, green beans and eggplant melting in peanut butter–coconut sauce. The crispy-skinned lechón (suckling pig) and fried calamari are far better than you'd expect on a hot line, too.
There are no carts at this dim sum specialist. Instead, diners order from a picture menu and profit with fresh, made-to-order cha siu bao, rice rolls and congees. Weekday lunch specials, like curried seafood with rice, cost no more than $6.99. The heart-shaped mango pudding is appealing, but we recommend heading down the street to ECK Bakery for heavenly egg custard tarts.
We all know that the banh mi is the result of French colonization of Vietnam, but this Euro-centric bakery makes the idea a little more prominent. There are only a few options on the menu posted above the counter, but among the expected chicken and meatball sandwiches, there's also French ham and saucisson, salami's Gallic cousin. Get it on a crusty baguette or croissant, both baked in-house.
In the former Seoul House space in Saigon Houston Plaza, Korea's first fried-chicken franchise is serving America its signature twice-fried birds. Get it on-the-bone or as tenders, with spicy or mild sauces—either way, your chicken will come with pickled daikon and crispy, salty fries. The bulgogi-and-slaw-topped hot dogs are worth a try, too.
It's impossible to encompass the diverse scope of Indonesian cuisine in a single restaurant, but this counter-service mom-and-pop spot gives it a courageous shot. Get a whole or half fried chicken with shrimp paste, or deep-fried duck with rice and spicy sauce. Love sate? There are three varieties here, including lamb with sweet soy sauce.
The poké trend takes a fast-casual, build-your-own form here. Join a counter staffer as he assembles your bowl or sushi burrito to your every specification, from base to protein to unlimited mix-ins. Pair yours with a bottle of off-brand Ramuné soda and serve-yourself mochi ice cream—we especially love the mint-chocolate flavor.
There are banh bao and a few jelly desserts on offer here, but most people come for one thing: bo ne. The Vietnamese steak-and-egg dish is exceptional, and, as evidenced by the Sunday crowds, clearly the neighborhood's preferred hangover remedy. The sweet, marinated meat is served on a sizzling platter with a homemade baguette for dipping in the broken yolk, which mixes deliciously with the marinade.
The restaurant's rice rolls, known as banh cuon, are some of the best in the city, but for those who can bear to skip them (or take them home for later), there are rewards. Chief among them is cha ca thang long, turmeric-and-galangal-marinated catfish served on a sizzling platter with dill. Break off pieces into a bowl, combine with noodles, herbs and fermented shrimp paste, and enjoy the funky flavors.
There is a certain uniformity amongst tech journalists in the USA. They all have Apple Macs, they all have iPhones, and, generally speaking, they all love Apple, and particularly the clicks than an iPhone story generates.
They can, therefore, be forgiven for feeling the rest of the world shares their opinions, but a recent survey by the Verge has revealed this may not quite be the case.
The professional survey, performed by consulting firm Reticle Research between September 28th to October 10th, included 1,520 people nationally representative of the US, based on 2016 US Census estimates, and can, therefore, be assumed to be more representative of the average US resident than the average tech buyer.
Given income inequality, this means someone with a household income of only $56,516 who would find spending thousands a year on expensive Apple products somewhat abhorrent.
The survey reveals Apple is even less trusted than Google, being greatly distrusted by 10% of people and only greatly trusted by 27% of people. Only 5% of people greatly distrusted Microsoft and 33% trusted Microsoft greatly.
In fact, 20% of people surveyed would not care at all if Apple disappeared tomorrow, and less than 40% would care “very much” if they did. Only 10% of people disliked Microsoft so much they would not care if they disappeared tomorrow, whereas 63% would care very much.
While the Verge theorized about Apple losing the trust of the market due to fumbles and anti-consumer mistakes such as losing the headphone jack, I think it is much more likely that Apple's “let them eat cake” approach of making high margin devices only for those who have money does not sit well with the average consumer. While their products may be aspirational, this is more about image than substance.
With the rich only getting richer and the poor getting more numerous and poorer, I suspect Apple will continue to rake in the cash but will be increasingly be seen, like the old Vertu brand, as the simple status symbol the company has always aspired to be, rather than an actual technology leader.

Following a Twitter conversation between some vapers and some others who mistakenly think they understand science, I decided to write a quick lesson for those who might want more than a bumper-sticker about this. The issue at hand is whether you can learn anything about the world from individual testimonials about people's experiences or other one-off “anecdotes”. The answer is obviously yes. It is safe to say that more than 99% of what each of us knows comes from such evidence. So why do so many people not understand this obvious fact, and habitually denigrate such evidence as “anecdotes”? It seems to be because they are stuck in a grade-school understanding of science.
I have written entire papers that are substantially about this point, but here is my quick explanation for how to better think about this. (Oh, and as an aside, anyone who thinks that this exposition is more correct due to the fact that I have also published versions in journals knows even less about understanding scientific evidence, but that is another story that readers will know I cover elsewhere.)
A good basic lesson in science for a seven-year-old is the following: Just because one reasonably likely event followed another reasonably likely event does not mean that the first caused the second. We all know that intuitively in most cases, but it is also easy to get tricked under particular circumstances. This is basically what superstition is — institutionalizing such unfounded observations in a desperate search for explanations for “random” events. Moreover we can be intentionally tricked into believing otherwise by people who profit from the claim of cause and effect. The most notable example is the medical profession, whose leading method throughout time (and to a substantial extent still today) was to wave their hands over someone and then take credit for the recovery that was going to happen anyway.
Moving on to about age eleven, with a bit of math available, another useful lesson is that unlikely events happen and seeking an explanation for any one of them is likely to result in the formation of superstition. My favorite example is starting a lesson with: “wow, you would never believe what happened! I was walking to class and saw a car with license plate number B2X 113…” (or whatever would fit the pattern for local license plates) “…What is the chance of that happening?! I wonder what caused it?” Of course, the chance of that exact event happening is impressively small. But the chance of seeing a car with some license plate number is about 100%, and since you could tell that story no matter what the number is, there is nothing interesting here.
With those lessons, we immunized grade-schoolers against being tricked by coincidence, teaching them to not over-conclude from one observation. We also teach young children “do not get into a car with a stranger”, which is good simple advice at the appropriate level for them. It guards against the worst possible mistake. But anyone who does not eventually learn that life is not so simplistic will have a rather hard time getting from the airport to their hotel.
Unfortunately, far too many people only get to the grade-school level in their understanding of scientific inference, but nevertheless think they are experts. People working in serious sciences get past that and learn the value of single observations (imagine: “The orbit of Mercury is not what Newtonian physics predicts. But who cares? That is just one anecdote. Ignore it.”). But a large portion of those pontificating about health science, particularly physicians, do not understand scientific inference any better than fifth grader. The worst problem is that they do not realize that.
Learning exactly how to tease the informational nuances out of any data, whether it be columns of numbers or a single personal testimonial, requires a lifetime of study and some decent intuition. But it is possible to teach a simple lesson to the “that is just an anecdote!!” crowd to make it obvious that their “never get in a car with a stranger”-level understanding is overly simplistic.
Consider a man who at 3:00 has no major injuries; shortly thereafter he gets into a car crash (and nothing else noteworthy occurs); upon talking to first-responders at 4:00 he says “I am basically ok, but I really hurt my wrist in the crash”; at 6:00 that evening, an x-ray shows he has a broken wrist. He tells us this anecdote, leading with the causal claim, “I broke my wrist in that car crash.” Do we believe his assertion of cause an effect? And, thus also conclude that (sometimes) car crashes cause broken wrists? It was, after all, just one story.
Of course we believe him. We are not idiots.
Would we say “I am only going to believe that car crashes can cause broken wrists after I see a statistical study in a journal that shows that to be the case”? Again, no, because we are not idiots.
I figure it is a safe bet that no one has ever done that study, comparing the hourly incidence rate of wrist fracture proximate to car crashes to the rate among those not experiencing car crashes. Again, because no one with the basic literacy skills to conduct a study is that much of an idiot (though if they did, they could undoubtedly get it published in a peer-reviewed journal). Now if the question were how often do car crashes cause wrist fractures, that would require gathering statistics, and that has been done. But it is obviously not necessary for assessing the basic point of whether the phenomenon ever happens. Moreover, the nice clean, controlled, artificial experiment with crash test dummies would tell us even less about the basic question of whether this phenomenon actually ever happens in the real world.
The only thing that would cause us to seriously doubt his claim is if we somehow thought he was lying about the events. Otherwise, if those events happened, we have evidence of cause-and-effect as convincing as ever exists in the real world. There is never any actual technical proof of causation in the real world, but this is evidence at the level that we loosely call proof. Sure, it is theoretically possible that hidden space aliens shot his wrist with a ray gun at just about the same time as the crash, or perhaps listening to Aerosmith on the car radio caused his wrist to fail (this is why there is never any proof), but it seems safe to assume otherwise.
So what is the difference between this “anecdote”, in terms of providing scientific evidence, and the grade-school teaching example (say “he had a cough; he took some homeopathic medicine; the cough went away; therefore the medicine cured the cough”)? There are a few key features, and recognizing them is the difference between thinking like a scientist and just repeating imperfect rules-of-thumb you learned in grade school. First, there are good reasons to believe that a car crash could cause a broken wrist, unlike singing along with Walk This Way. I trust I do not have to explain those. Second, the incidence rate of spontaneous wrist fracture, unassociated with any dramatic event, is trivially small during any given afternoon, in contrast with the rate of an extant cough going away sometime over a several-day period. Thus it is safe to rule out the “it would have happened anyway” alternative. Third, the event and the outcome are both well-defined and definitively occurred, unlike many superstitious cause-and-effect claims (e.g., “I prayed yesterday that I would have a good day today, and, sure enough, I found $100 in the sofa cushion” — something similar to the license plate example).
Of course, these are not the only characteristics that might cause you to draw scientific conclusions from a single observation. (They do not describe that case of drawing conclusions from Mercury's orbit, for example.) There are no simplistic rules like that, which is why scientific inference requires thinking, not recipes. But they are the useful ones in this case.
In what other case might these observations about drawing a conclusion from a single observation be useful? Obviously the case of people quitting smoking thanks to e-cigarettes or some other low-risk substitute. There are obvious good reasons to believe that finding a better substitute for a behavior can cause an end to that behavior. The rate of spontaneous, unexplained smoking cessation in a given week, or even month, is very small. The ostensible cause and effect are very clearly defined and definitively observable. Thus, when a single individual says “I smoked for years; I tried to quit some times but failed; but then I tried switching to e-cigarettes and that finally let me quit smoking”, you either have to claim she is lying about the basic facts or recognize that it is as close to proof as can exist that e-cigarettes caused her to quit smoking. From that you can further conclude that — at least sometimes — e-cigarettes cause smoking cessation. No further study is necessary. Of course, if you want to figure out how many times this has happened or how often the attempted switch is successful, then you need to gather the right statistics; but those are different questions.
So, dear reader, congratulations. If you read this and understood it (or already understood the points, of course), you understand science at better than the “never get in a car with a stranger” level. It is not, by itself, everything you need to know about drawing scientific inference from non-systematic observations, but it is a definite step up from the naive, simplistic, and grossly incorrect claims that “anecdotes cannot prove anything” or “anecdotes are the lowest form of evidence” (whatever that means).
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A former chaplain at an Arkansas women's prison is charged with sexually assaulting three inmates.
Prosecutor Henry Boyce announced Thursday that 50 counts of sexual assault charges had been filed against 67-year-old Kenneth Dewitt.
The charging documents allege that Dewitt carried on sexual relationships with three inmates between 2013 and 2014.
Jeff Rosenzweig, an attorney representing Dewitt, says he is making arrangements to turn himself in to authorities.
Arkansas Department of Correction officials said two inmates at the McPherson Unit in Newport, about 90 miles northeast of Little Rock, notified prison staff in December 2014 that they had been in sexual relationships with Dewitt.
Department spokeswoman Cathy Frye says staff notified Arkansas State Police immediately. A separate federal investigation into complaints of sexual harassment at McPherson is ongoing.
The country's biggest cities are seeing an uptick in their white residents after decades of losing them to the suburbs, according to an analysis of new Census data by Brookings Institution demographer William Frey.
Between 2010 and 2014, 24 of the country's 50 largest cities saw their white population rise and just five watched it fall. In the decade before that, from 2000 to 2010, only 15 cities saw white population gains and 35 saw declines. Here's a Frey chart showing the white population gain in the 50 biggest U.S. cities in the last five years, in stark contrast to previous decades:
Detroit is the clearest example of this trend. After 60 years of bleeding out its white population, the city gained 14,000 white residents from 2010 to 2014, notes Frey. This rise was partly because many white Millennials have recently moved to the long-languishing city, prompting some shaking of heads. A recent Fox Business article—with an Onion-esque headline that reads “Meet the Millennials Who Say Detroit Is the Place To Be”—features interviews with some of these young whites. Here's 23-year-old Avery Hairston:
“There's this romantic element to Detroit, rooted in history of invention and entrepreneurship. The fact that it's partially abandoned now adds an element of ‘wild wild west' mystic,” he says.
Young people, generally, have set sail for cities in recent years because they display “an enthusiasm for urban living,” as CityLab's Richard Florida puts it—at least more so than their parents did. Some Boomers have the city itch, too. The biggest rises in white populations have been within the 15-to-34 and 65-to-74 age brackets (below), according to Frey.
While white Millennials are a part of the trend toward cities, people of color have actually added more to city population growths in the last five years. So it's probably not likely that “the nation will see substantially whiter big cities in the future,” writes Frey. But as interesting as this movement of young whites is, Frey thinks it may just be a blip on the chart. Here's how he sums it up:
There is also the possibility that the recent city revival could be short-lived and related to the plight of struggling millennials who may really prefer suburban living but are still unable to benefit fully from the post-recession economic recovery. Nonetheless the new white city gains indicate that long term trends like city white flight are not irreversible, even if the current turnaround winds up being a short-lived phenomenon.

The smart grid turns to high-performance computing to guide its development and keep it working.
One mid-August afternoon in 2003, a cascade of events shuts down the power grid from Ohio through much of the Northeast and Ontario, affecting an estimated 50 million people. In many places, the power returned by evening. But some areas went without electricity for four days, and others had rolling blackouts for more than a week. The cost ran into the billions of dollars.
A joint U.S.-Canadian task force concluded that both human and technological failures started the cascade when transmission lines began to fail, overloading the network's remaining lines. Unaware of moment-by-moment developments, operators did not divert a surge of power out of the system. As a result, they were unable to prevent the blackout.
In the blackout's aftermath, the North American power system, sometimes called the biggest machine on Earth, is turning into what utilities planners call a “smart grid.”
The smart grid will provide the information and diagnostic tools operators need. Network-wide high-speed sensors will provide real-time readings from multiple points. High-level automation will apply algorithms to help make effective decisions. And this revamped machine will need high-performance computing to guide its development and keep it working.
New algorithms are becoming increasingly important as renewable energy sources, mainly wind and solar power, continue to grow and introduce random supply fluctuations.
Researchers charged with helping the grid become as reliable and cost-effective as possible face several challenges. An important example is the security-constrained problem – arriving at the optimal level of vital but expensive reserve energy at all times.
“You're trying to compute the mix of energy that will not just minimize the cost, but you will minimize the cost and will survive the loss of any one asset,” explains Mihai Anitescu, a senior computational mathematician in the Laboratory for Advanced Numerical Software in the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory.
Such computations are an important part of a Department of Energy Advanced Scientific Computing Research program-sponsored project Anitescu leads: Multifaceted Mathematics for Complex Energy Systems (M2ACS). He works with colleagues at Argonne, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Chicago to develop simulations and computational tools for a more stable and efficient power grid.
Among the tools the M2ACS team is developing are algorithms that gather data from throughout one of the four giant networks, or interconnects, that comprise the grid. The algorithms run scenarios that enable operators to make intelligent decisions in time to prevent blackouts and equipment damage.
Any power grid is peppered by random influences, such as equipment failures and rising and falling consumer demand. Add the growing use of renewable energy sources, with their unpredictability, and the algorithms become even more complex. For example, “you do not know exactly how much wind you're going to have,” Anitescu says. “It's not like a coal plant, where you say, ‘Just give me one gigawatt.' It's going to be what it's going to be. So you have to allow for more scenarios to deal with the uncertainty in renewable supply.”
The team has developed randomly determined optimization algorithms that can generate tens of thousands of scenarios incorporating billions of random variables and billions of constraints on the demands placed on grid components. By limiting the uncertainties inherent in outcomes that may result from a given operator decision, the algorithms allow power facilities to make more intelligent decisions. That also means they can operate with smaller reserves, maintaining a stable system while saving money and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The algorithms are scalable, meaning each facility can invest in only as much computer hardware as it needs.
“We can now solve a large number of scenarios for the real-size networks,” says Anitescu, whose study showed networks would be able to incorporate “more uncertain sources such as wind and power without losing reliability.”
Exactly how to add more wind, solar and other power sources hinges on another set of tools the M2ACS team is developing: predictive models of the grid's behavior.
Each time a generator quits, a transmission line goes down or a lightning strike delivers a dose of electricity to the grid, the system must adjust. Within each interconnect, generators are synchronized to put out their 60 cycles per second in unison. As generators accelerate to make up for a lost generator or transmission line or slow down when power demand drops, they can veer off that critical rate. Since the generators, transformers and other equipment are all designed to function at 60 cycles, an excursion too far off that frequency can damage equipment.
To avoid expensive, lengthy shutdowns and repairs, many relays – the circuit breakers of the grid's high-voltage realm – are set at conservative levels. They may cut off power when they could have continued running. “It's what happened at the Super Bowl in 2013,” Anitescu says. “That blackout happened because somebody assigned the breaker too low of a value.”
The team's predictive models aren't for use in making on-the-fly decisions. Instead, they're for predicting grid behavior in various conditions, then designing networks and setting the parameters for relays. “We are at the stage where we can now simulate an interconnect in real time or faster than real-time,” Anitescu says. These tools will likely be further developed and become available for use in a few years, he predicts.
The M2ACS team thinks their tools and simulations can lead to a deeper understanding of the grid. Although humans built the world's biggest machine, it may hold some mysteries. For example, researchers are still interpreting one observation from the 2003 blackout: Part of the grid did not fail that day. “The cascade did not go to a full blackout, although that is what the theory predicted,” Anitescu says. “An island emerged which was self-sustaining.”
The surprising resilience of a grid section suggests that a cascade may not necessarily lead to a blackout. Maybe the grid can be modified to “fail gracefully,” Anitescu says. “In other words, we don't at the moment design for limited failure. We design for complete non-failure but then if a failure starts to grow, we don't know quite what the system will do.”
Inspired by this idea, two M2ACS collaborators, Christopher DeMarco at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Jonathan Weare at the University of Chicago, are borrowing mathematical tools from chemistry to determine how the grid can operate at different levels of connectivity, analogous to the different energy levels in a chemical compound. A step away from an all-or-nothing, on-or-off model of the grid might be a step toward a more responsive and reliable system.
Today, the power grid is somewhat calm but also expensive. With growing renewable sources, it's likely to be harder to tame. “It's like not having realized the full potential,” Anitescu says. “But there's going to be a lot more freedom – and people being able to use the energy as they want to use it. And we have to allow for that.”

It was often said that one of the biggest wishes of Enzo Ferrari was to build a car capable of winning the Indianapolis 500, but aside from a futile effort with Alberto Ascari in 1952 (one we discussed at an earlier date in this project) the Prancing Horse remained a high-profile absentee from the Brickyard for nearly 40 years. That very nearly changed however in 1986, when commercial interests and political upheaval in Formula One led to the construction of one of the most intriguing Indycar projects of all time.
By the early 1980's, Ferrari's Commendatore Enzo Ferrari had begun to grow disillusioned with what he saw in Formula One, his cars weren't winning as often as he wanted, whilst the political upheaval stemming from the FISA/ FOCA war of 1982 was still being felt around an increasingly uncertain paddock. At the same time, sales of Ferrari production cars had begun to slow in North America, and Enzo soon came to believe that his F1 team's involvement in a sole US Grand Prix did not provide the necessary level of promotion of his company across the Atlantic. This, added with Ferrari's passion for the Indianapolis 500, led to the 86 year old to commission the construction of a new single-seater machine designed to compete at the Indianapolis 500.
On paper, construction of such a machine would serve Ferrari on two fronts; a presence in the CART series would give Ferrari a much-needed increase in exposure over in America, but more importantly would also serve as a political tool within the Formula One paddock; where the input of Ferrari into the future of the sport would be taken further into account due to the threat of them leaving the sport being seen as increasingly legitimate.
In early 1985, Gustav Brunner was hired as a designer for the Ferrari team to work on the Indy project, visiting that year's Indy 500 with then Ferrari president Vittorio Ghidella. Murmurings surrounding the presence of Ferrari at the Brickyard began to spread around the paddock, and Goodyear president Leo Mehl recommended the Truesports CART team for a research and development partnership, the stories surrounding the project began to gain significant momentum. In the fall of 1985, Truesports driver Bobby Rahal demonstrated a March 85C for Ferrari at the Fiorano test track for 40 laps, where Rahal was impressed with the kindness and respect he received from the Italian marque during his spell with the team. Further testing on the March took place in the hands of Michele Alboreto over the winter, and soon emerged as the basis for a fully working Ferrari Indycar machine which came to be known by those within the team as Project 637. By the summer of 1986, the Ferrari Indycar was available to begin testing, with Alboreto setting laps times in the new machine comparative to those that he managed in the March nine months previously. Rumours soon began to spread over a link-up with Truesports for 1987, until rule changes in the world of Formula One soon brought an abrupt end to the Ferrari Indycar dream.
Shortly after Ferrari unveiled their Indycar machine for the first time; it was announced by the FIA that Formula 1 would return to a 3.5 litre normally aspirated, eight cylinder formula in time for the 1989 season. The news over the engine regulations didn't sit well with Ferrari, who had long been an advocate of a 12 cylinder layout for his machines and felt that the new rules would hinder Ferrari's competitiveness within the sport.
During a meeting with FIA officials at Maranello, It was reported that Enzo stated that if V12's were not allowed as part of the new regulations then he would pursue other options within his team. At that moment, everyone in the room heard an engine being started, which could be identified as a turbocharged V8 of about 3 litres, with Ferrari pointing out to the people in the room what they were hearing. The attendants supposedly all of a sudden realized that Ferrari was indeed in an advanced state with its Indy project. At that moment, the deal was struck that V12 engines would be allowed in F1, under the condition that Ferrari wouldn't further pursue its Indycar plans, and in the process bringing an end to Project 637 once and for all.
Sadly, the Ferrari 637 never turned a wheel in competition and has become just a footnote in history, but the aura and intrigue surrounding it's conception makes it one of the most compelling what if stories in the history of the Brickyard. And one worthy of still be discussed in years to come.

When Valve announced the Steam Controller, many in the PC gaming world emitted a sigh of relief upon hearing that a dedicated next-gen PC gaming controller was being created. The controller featured out-of-this-world touch pads and even a center placed touchscreen that would be able to display custom buttons and functions.
Unfortunately, today two game developers have tweeted from the Steam Developer Days Conference that Valve has decided to remove the touchscreen all together and replace it with buttons. The reason being is that the touchscreen distracted gamers too much and Valve wants its users to focus on the big screen in front of them, not the small one on the controller. Additionally, the gamepad's buttons have been reconfigured into a diamond pattern for better backwards compatibility with older games.
Hillary Clinton was interviewed on Saturday at FBI headquarters in Washington, as part of the investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state in the Obama administration.
Trump deletes tweet with image of the Star of David, Hillary Clinton and money Read more
The interview lasted three and a half hours, the Clinton campaign said, and came at the end of a week in which the attorney general, Loretta Lynch, expressed her regret over a private meeting with Bill Clinton which critics used to cast doubt on her impartiality on the email issue.
Clinton's campaign confirmed the meeting early on Saturday. Later, the former secretary of state told MSNBC she had been “eager” to participate in the interview and was “pleased to have the opportunity” to help the justice department bring the investigation to a conclusion.
Speaking to MSNBC's Chuck Todd, Clinton agreed that the FBI interview had been “civil and businesslike” but declined to discuss specifics. It remains unclear when the investigation will come to an end or whether any prosecutions will follow.
Clinton has nonetheless been eager to close down an issue that has dogged every step of her presidential campaign. Her email practices while heading the state department were first revealed in March 2015. She launched her bid to succeed Barack Obama in the White House the following month.
The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has said he would pursue a criminal indictment of Clinton if elected president. On Saturday, he tweeted: “It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!”
Reince Priebus, chair of the Republican National Committee, released a statement in which he said: “Hillary Clinton has just taken the unprecedented step of becoming the first major party presidential candidate to be interviewed by the FBI as part of a criminal investigation surrounding her reckless conduct.
“That the FBI wanted her for questioning reinforces her central role in deliberately creating a culture which put her own political ambitions above state department rules and jeopardized our national security.”
Between May 2015 and February 2016, more than 30,000 of Clinton's emails were released in tranches. Among the emails was information marked as classified by government officials, although Clinton's campaign has said the material was not classified at the time it was exchanged. The matter was referred to the justice department, which opened an investigation in July 2015.
In May of this year, a state department audit found that the use of the private server had violated department rules. Violations cited in the audit included the use of mobile devices for official business without checking if they were secure.
Asked on NBC if she had violated the law, Clinton reiterated that communications marked as classified during the state department's review of her emails had only been done so retroactively.
“Let me just repeat what I have repeated for many months now,” Clinton said. “I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.”
She added: “There is a process for the review of material before it is released to the public and there were decisions made that material should be classified. So therefore it would not be publicly released.”
Clinton's meeting with the FBI signaled that the investigation could be nearing its final stages. She is set to formally accept her party's nomination for president later this month, at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.
Polling has found Americans split over Clinton's email issue. Republicans are overwhelmingly more likely than Democrats to view her behavior as unethical, but the controversy has taken a toll more broadly on whether voters view Clinton as trustworthy.
Clinton acknowledged to MSNBC it was a perception she needed to overcome.
“I have said that I'm going to continue to put forth my record, what I have stood for, do everything I can to earn the trust of the voters of our country,” she said. “I know that's something that I'm going to keep working on.”

Lynch said on Friday she would accept whatever recommendations were put forward by the FBI and career prosecutors upon the conclusion of the case.
Lynch described her encounter with Bill Clinton, at an airport in Phoenix, as a purely social discussion. But Republicans and even some Democrats said the timing of the meeting raised concerns and Lynch acknowledged it had “cast a shadow” over the justice department's investigation, a process she insisted was independent.
“It's important to make it clear that that meeting with President Clinton does not have a bearing on how this matter will be reviewed and resolved,” Lynch said at the Aspen ideas festival in Colorado.
“The recommendations will be reviewed by career supervisors in the department of justice and in the FBI, and by the FBI director. And then, as is the common process, they present it to me and I fully expect to accept their recommendations.”
Clinton told MSNBC the meeting was both short and unplanned, and characterized it as “an exchange of pleasantries”. She also echoed Lynch's claim that the justice department review was not discussed.
“I think, you know, hindsight is 20/20,” she said. “Both the attorney general and my husband have said they wouldn't do it again.
“Obviously no one wants to see any untoward conclusions drawn.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced new rules for labeling meat from grass-fed livestock. The rules stipulate that meat labeled "grass fed" must come from animals fed solely on grasses, hay and other non-grain vegetation.
This label will help consumers choose meat from 'smart pasture operations' that are better for the environment. Unlike massive confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), these farms use sophisticated land management practices to maximize productivity without despoiling our air, water and soil.
Raising livestock on pastures avoids the crowding and illnesses that plague livestock in CAFOs. Modern grass-fed methods are also more cost-effective and environmentally friendly because they take advantage of low-cost grasses that typically require little added water, and few or no synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. A growing number of farmers across the country are now turning to this modern approach to livestock production.Additionally, grass-fed beef is better for public health. Grass-fed cattle contains higher levels of beneficial fats that may prevent heart disease and strengthen the immune system than meat from cattle raised in CAFOs. The study also found that grass-fed meat is often leaner than CAFO meat.
The rule becomes effective on November 15.

Of course, it doesn't matter that the morning after pills don't cause abortion - they simply stop ovulation to prevent a pregnancy from occurring, or prevent sperm from reaching the egg. It's more important that elected judges not give voters (or the Catholic church) a reason to target them when they run again:
CHICAGO (Reuters) - An Illinois appellate court Friday affirmed a lower court finding that the state cannot force pharmacies and pharmacists to sell emergency contraceptives - also known as "morning after pills" - if they have religious objections. In 2005, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich mandated that all pharmacists and pharmacies sell "Plan B," the brand name for a drug designed to prevent pregnancy following unprotected sex or a known or suspected contraceptive failure if taken within 72 hours. Some anti-abortion advocates object to the drugs, which work by preventing the release of an egg, preventing fertilization or stopping a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus. In 2011, an Illinois judge entered an injunction against the rule, finding no evidence that the drugs had ever been denied on religious grounds, and that the law was not neutral since it was designed to target religious objectors.
And how, exactly, is this to be implemented? If there are four pharmacists on staff and one of them has religious objections, that person gets veto power? Of course, this also applies to those who don't want to sell the pill to sluts. Why, if you worked hard enough, you can come up with religious reasons to refuse all kinds of medication! No medication to people with Type II diabetes, because gluttony is a sin. No pain killers for new mom with an episiotomy, because the Bible says women should suffer giving birth. And let's not forget people dying of cancer: No more morphine! God wouldn't want you dying one minute before your appointed time.
Personally, I think Jesus would be appalled.

EAST LANSING - Danton Cole , an 18-year coaching veteran with international, professional and collegiate experience, has been appointed head coach of the Michigan State hockey program by MSU Athletics Director Mark Hollis. Cole, who was a key member of some of the most successful Spartan hockey teams in program history, comes to Michigan State from USA Hockey's National Team Development Program where he has mentored some of the nation's top young players on the U-17 and U-18 teams for the past seven seasons.
"We're looking forward to having Danton Cole back with us at Michigan State," MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon said. "He brings a championship pedigree and a heart for working with student athletes. He's going to develop well-rounded young men who will achieve greatness both on and off the ice—people who will be terrific representatives of Spartan hockey and Michigan State University."
" Danton Cole has a wealth of experience throughout the game as both a player and a coach, and an understanding of what it takes to win championships at every level," said Hollis. "He's raised the Stanley Cup as a player, understands the obligations of running a Division I hockey program, and he's plugged into the country's best young talent from his time with the USA Hockey National Team Development Program. He has demonstrated the ability to develop young talent into great players. Most importantly, his comprehensive approach to developing men of character goes beyond on-ice instruction and into the classroom with a commitment to education, as evidenced both by his work with the NTDP and his time as a student-athlete during which he captured the Big Ten Medal of Honor.
"Danton once told me that being the head coach at Michigan State was his dream job. But what really impressed me was when he volunteered to assist me in doing whatever it took to help Spartan hockey be successful – even if it meant finding someone else to coach. I was struck by his willingness to put the program above himself. That selfless nature and devotion to Spartan hockey will serve Danton well as he guides the Spartans for years to come.
"Hockey has taken Danton Cole so many different places, but it's with great pride and excitement that I welcome him back home to Michigan State."
Cole is the seventh head coach in program history.
"I'm really honored to have the opportunity to represent Michigan State University and Spartan hockey," said Cole. "This is a position to which I've always aspired. I wasn't sure the timing would ever work out, but I'm very fortunate. My mom and dad both went to Michigan State – I didn't grow up around MSU, I grew up at MSU. It has been an enormous part of my life. Once I got into coaching, it didn't take long for me to realize I wanted to get back on campus and try to accomplish what we did when I was playing for the legendary Ron Mason.
"I want to thank Coach Anastos and the previous staff for all of their efforts as we continue to move the program forward and build upon the great tradition of Spartan hockey. As a program, we want to compete for Big Ten championships and be a part of the NCAA Tournament, because as I experienced as a player, once you get in the tournament, you're on the doorstep of a national title. We're going to identify and recruit young men that want to be Spartans and share our vision of excellence on and off the ice. Another priority will be to continue working toward a renovation of Munn Ice Arena, providing our student-athletes and fans a world-class facility and tremendous home-ice advantage."
Cole has guided Team USA to two gold medals (2012, 2014) and one bronze medal (2016) at the International Ice Hockey Federation Men's Under-18 World Championship and three top-three finishes at the World Under-17 Hockey Challenge (2011, 2013, 2014), the top events in each age group.
His teams have also enjoyed success in numerous international tournaments, having captured U17 titles at the Four Nations (2010, 2012) and Vlad Dzurilla (2011) tournaments. While leading the U18s, the U.S. has placed first on three occasions in major competitions: twice at the Four Nations (2011, 2015) and once at Five Nations (2014) tournaments.
Cole's first taste of international coaching came with the U.S. Under-18 Select Team at the 2009 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Cup, where he served as assistant coach. He assumed that same role in 2013 for the bronze-medal winning U.S. Men's National Team at the IIHF Men's World Championship.
Cole's coaching career started immediately following his playing days. After retiring from the Grand Rapids Griffins in 1999-2000, he remained with the team for the season as an assistant before spending 2001-02 with Muskegon in the United Hockey League, guiding the team to the playoff championship.
Cole followed that with a nearly three-year stint as head coach of the Griffins which included two Calder Cup Playoff appearances in 2003 and 2004. After coaching the UHL's Motor City Mechanics through 2006, he amassed a five-year pro coaching record of 222-126-17 (.632).
In 2006-07, Cole landed his first college job as an assistant at Bowling Green. After one year at BGSU, he was hired as head coach at Alabama-Huntsville where he went 23-59-12 in three seasons. He led UAH to the College Hockey America tournament title in his third season with the school in 2009-10, earning the program's second-ever berth in the NCAA Tournament, before moving on to USA Hockey in 2010.
Cole's playing career at MSU began in 1985-86 as he helped further the Spartans' trek to sustained national prominence. In his four years at Michigan State, the Spartans went 131-44-8 (.738), winning a NCAA National Championship (1986), making three NCAA Frozen Four appearances (1986, 1987, 1989), capturing two CCHA regular-season titles (1986, 1989) and two CCHA Tournament championships (1987, 1989).
As a junior at MSU, Cole was second in team scoring with 20 goals and 56 points, and then was the third-highest scorer as a senior with 29 goals and 62 points.
Cole, who was the recipient of the Distinguished Spartan Award in 2013, ended his Michigan State career with 69 goals and 94 assists for 163 points. He shares the MSU career games played record of 180 with former teammate Don McSween.
Cole graduated with a degree in finance and excelled in the classroom at MSU as he was a three-time CCHA All-Academic Team honoree. He is one of nine Spartan hockey players to have received the Big Ten Medal of Honor, garnering the accolade as a senior.
Cole was drafted in the sixth round, 123rd overall, by the Winnipeg Jets in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft. After making his pro debut with the AHL's Moncton Hawks in 1989-90, Cole saw his first action in the NHL that season as well, recording two points in two games for the Jets.
Cole went on to play 11 seasons professionally. He played 318 NHL games over six seasons with Winnipeg, Tampa Bay, New Jersey, the New York Islanders and Chicago.
He is one of 11 Spartans to have hoisted the Stanley Cup as he helped the New Jersey Devils to the 1995 Cup.
Cole played four more seasons in the IHL for the Grand Rapids Griffins before retiring with the team in 1999-2000.
He represented the USA as a member of the Men's National Team on three occasions (1990, 1991, 1994) and earned outstanding player of the 1991 IIHF Men's World Championship.
A native Michigander, Cole was born in Pontiac and raised in Lansing. He played youth hockey around the state and then in the Ontario Junior Hockey League in 1984-85, recording 95 points in 41 games.
He graduated from Waverly High School, where he was a two-time all-league baseball selection.
Cole, 50, and his wife Debbie, have three daughters - Ashton, Madeleine and Payton.

Valencia Valencia Eibar Eibar 4 0 FT Game Details GameCast
Lineups and Stats
Valencia continued their recent revival with a convincing 4-0 Primera Division defeat of Eibar that was inspired by a hat-trick from striker Paco Alcacer.
The victory was their third in succession, following previous successes away at Barcelona and at home over Sevilla, and takes them up to eighth place from 13th, after their recent struggles towards the foot of Spain's top flight.
Since succeeding Gary Neville, Pako Ayestaran - Rafael Benitez's former assistant manager at Valencia and Liverpool - has now overseen three wins and a defeat, and ended any lingering fears one of the country's biggest clubs were at risk of relegation.
The talented Alcacer, 22, gave the hosts the lead in the 10th minute having missed the penalty awarded for Dani Garcia's foul on Daniel Parejo. Eibar goalkeeper Asier Riesgo could only parry Alcacer's effort straight back into his path, from where the striker comfortably finished into a near-open goal.
With pressure growing in their pursuit of another, Valencia's second goal came 18 minutes later. Receiving possession from Joao Cancelo, from directly in front of goal Alcacer comfortably sent a right-footed shot into the top right corner.
He secured his hat-trick five minutes before half-time, when heading in from close range after Rodrigo's well-placed cross.
Cancelo added a fourth in the second half, by shooting into the top right in the 56th minute when Rodrigo found him in the penalty area.
The result pushes Eibar down to 11th from 10th place.

Real Talk: How To Skate Open Roads and Not Get Busted
10
Back in high school I got into some minor legal trouble after an incident involving an unlocked back door at the local garbage truck garage and about 15 cans of spray paint. The incident taught me about the second most important rule in life: don't get caught*.
Cliche slogans notwithstanding, skateboarding at high speed on a public road is a crime in most places. Even where it isn't expressly illegal, people get freaked out by skaters and call the cops all the time. In my experience the police usually just give me a lecture about how dangerous this is and tell me to get lost, but I have gotten a couple tickets over the years.
Generally, in life, you don't want to be talking to the cops for any reason. Here's how to skate and minimize your exposure to the boys in blue:
KNOW THE SPOT: Even if you don't know the spot, you should know about spots and how to handle the various scenarios of roads, traffic and policing conditions. If you're not a local, ask a local. If you are local, figure it out. No matter the spot, local or visitor, take a drive through where you're going to skate to check road conditions. Getting even a quick feel for the road that day is always recommended and is you're first best line of defence against accidents and arrest.
TIMING: For safety and stealthiness reasons, you don't want to skate during extremely busy traffic periods even if you know the spot. First light in the morning on a weekend is usually the best time. Midday during the week, between the morning and afternoon commutes is also good. Avoid rush hour.
DON'T LURK: As they say up in Portland, be ninjas, not pirates. If you're skating a heated-out spot, don't roll up to the spot and spend 25 minutes changing wheels, smoking, and getting your gear on. Prepare your board at home and be ready to skate immediately when you get out of the car. If you do need to wrench on your board, do it out of sight of passing traffic. And remember: real G's move in silence like lasagna.
DON'T SKATE LIKE AN IDIOT: Stay in your lane and give people the smile-and-wave. Spotters are recommended even on quick missions. Don't do that fucking stupid swerve-at-oncoming-cars NorCal thing. If you do do something stupid, peace out for an hour or so.
BE ALERT: The shuttle driver and/or spotters should pay attention to uphill cars or pedestrians. If they are visibly bummed, it's time to leave for the next spot. See above rule for don't skate like an idiot.
ONE AND DONE: It usually takes at least ten minutes for police to show up after they're called. If you know the spot is heated, take one run and jump into the car quickly and and leave for the next spot before they arrive. There are few things as satisfying as driving past cops on their way to bust you.
BONUS CRIMINALITY ADVICE:
ONLY COMMIT ONE CRIME AT A TIME: Skate long enough and you will eventually deal with the police. Most cops don't really give a shit about skateboarding. They absolutely do care about controlled substances, and the stereotype about skateboarders being potheads has a firm basis in truth. A skate ticket might ruin your afternoon. Getting popped for possession in the wrong place might ruin your life. Smoke at home or get one of those crazy science vaporizer things.
Finally, if you do everything right and the cops come anyway, just tell them you left your ID at home and your name is Patrick Switzer.
*In case you were wondering, the number one most important rule in life is “never pay retail.”

On June 24, the interior minister of the elected Thai government – ousted the month before in a military coup – officially formed an opposition movement in exile, denouncing the junta as illegitimate and vowing to fight against it. The name of the movement, Seri Thai, echoes a World War 2 resistance movement who fought against the Japanese. It will strike a chord with those who oppose the coup. The date of the announcement – always important to numerically minded Thais – is also symbolic, referencing the anniversary of the 1932 revolution that abolished the absolute monarchy and set out to establish democracy in the country.
However, to dismiss the timing of the statement as pure symbolism may be missing the point. In many ways, the crisis that has convulsed Thailand for much of the past decade dates back to this turbulent period and can be understood as part of a long, historical struggle between civilian politicians and royalist elites for primacy – a theme explored in the recently released book “Good Coup” Gone Bad, a collection of essays on the 2006 military coup, currently not available for purchase in Thailand.
Rapid social change, displeasure at the privilege given to Siam's multitude of aristocrats, and the exogenous shock of the great depression laid the foundations for the revolution of 1932. As these things go, the events on June 24 were underwhelming and can be more accurately described as a bloodless coup. However the ease with which power was taken not only obscured the momentous change that had taken place, as seven hundred years of arbitrary monarchical rule were overthrown in a single day, but also failed to signal the eighty years of contention that would follow as a result.
The protagonists of the coup – led by civil servant Pridi Banomyong and military officer Plaek Phibunsongkhram – inherited state institutions packed with royalists, many of them blue bloods who could claim lineage to the expansive family trees of past monarchs. Either unwilling or unable to abolish the monarchy altogether, they moved instead to neuter it by placing it under a constitution. However, the aristocrats steadfastly refused to share power with the new “commoner” elites and much bickering ensued. Despite the coup promoters ceding some ground, the conflict eventually culminated in the Boworadet Rebellion of 1933, led by the fiery Prince Boworadet. The elite uprising was put down after heavy fighting in the capital, leaving the royalists considerably weakened. In 1934, unable to accept his new conditions King Prajadhipok left Siam, never to return. He abdicated the following year.
In the years that followed, Phibun deserted his ally Pridi, along with the more noble aims of the 1932 revolution, and lurched to the Right, becoming the first of Thailand's many military dictators. However, what distinguishes him from the others was his distrust of the palace and his efforts to curb its power. From the era of Sarit Thanarat onwards this changed, as the military and the monarchy formed a close alliance that has lasted until today, allowing the palace and aristocrats to expand their influence. The two institutions leaned on each other considerably through the next few decades of Red Scare, student uprisings, deadly crackdowns, public lynchings and the “politicide” of the Thai Communist Party.
During the eighties, the appointed premiership of Prem Tinsulanonda – an ex general and palace favorite – brought stability and steady economic growth. The period was a high point for Thai royalism and those on the “yellow” side of the political divide look back on it with nostalgia. Given the weak institution he inherited, the reestablishment of royal prestige during the reign of King Bhumipol was nothing short of miraculous. However, with development and integration into the international community came demands for a fuller democracy, threatening the hegemony of the elites.
In 1988, Chatichai Choonhavan became Thailand's first properly elected prime minster in over a decade, only to be overthrown three years later by a military coup. In what has now become a familiar script, the military move was justified on the grounds that Chatichai was corrupt and presided over a “parliamentary dictatorship.” Since then, only Thaksin Shinawatra has completed a full term in office, although he too was unceremoniously dumped by the military in 2006, one year into his second term. His sister Yingluck, ousted in May this year, is the latest in a long line of elected politicians deemed unacceptable, not only by the traditional elites centered around the palace but increasingly by the Sino-Thai capitalist elites, with much overlap between the two.
The historical narrative that the new Seri Thai movement present is that, more than eighty years after the 1932 revolution, two competing visions of Thailand remain at odds with each other. In one, sovereignty lies with the people and the constitution is paramount. In the other, the kingdom is ruled from above by “good” and “moral” people. Both visions seem to enjoy considerable support but high electoral turnouts suggest the majority of people have not lost their faith in a democratic system. In the declaration read out on June 24, Jakrapob Penkair – spokesman for Seri Thai and founding member of the Red Shirts – declared that their purpose was to “oppose the military dictatorship and its aristocratic network.” He claimed that the junta was attempting to “re-entrench anti-democratic elements into Thailand's body politic and to sabotage the development of Thai democracy.”
Seri Thai are not the only ones to have invoked the 1932 revolution. On the same day, a group called Reporters Without Censors issued a declaration to uphold journalistic standards despite the junta's grip on the media. The group referred to the revolution, claiming that it was “based on the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity which, although you have yet to be consolidated in the Thai political system, are nonetheless rooted deep in the hearts of the Thai people.”
Online, a plaque commemorating the revolution and the enactment of the first constitution became a popular meme for those opposing the coup, with the image appearing as people's profile pictures on Facebook. A small group even attempted to mark the anniversary by gathering in the Royal Plaza in Bangkok, where the plaque is embedded in the cement, only to find the area cordoned off and guarded by the military.
And in 2012, the Red Shirts held a rally to commemorate the eightieth anniversary of the revolution, with core leader Nattawut Saikua telling the crowd that “despite the events of 1932, very little has actually changed in Thailand and the core of the old system remains, dragging its feet.” He claimed that “an epic struggle was on the verge of happening”.
On the other side of the Thai political schism the rhetoric is different. The Yellow Shirts – whose protests between 2005 and 2008 helped bring down two elected governments – wore t-shirts emblazoned with slogans such as “we will fight for the King.” Animated by a toxic blend of ultra-royalism and nationalism, they saw politicians as venal and Thaksin as an existential threat to the monarchy. Their sense of entitlement and righteousness were frustrated by their inability to win at the ballot box and so they advocated a “new politics” in which representatives were appointed not elected.
The PDRC – whose six month protest brought chaos and violence to Bangkok, paving the way for May's coup – are the latest incarnation of the same ethos. Their claims of representing the maha prachachon, or “great mass,” are at odds with their elitist outlook, succinctly articulated by movement leader Chitipas Bhirombhakdhi. In a now infamous interview, the heiress to the billion dollar Beer Singha fortune – and an aristocrat on her mother's side – said that “many Thais lack true knowledge of democracy, especially rural people.” The proposed solution is an unspecified period of rule by an appointed government, who will oversee vague “reforms” to create an “absolute democracy” free from corruption and vote-buying which, they claim, sullies the current system. Most Thais in the provinces believe the move is designed to take away their votes.
Thailand cannot move forward until it has dealt with its past. As in 1932, the advance towards a meaningful democracy once again faces resistance from entrenched royalist elites. Today, however, the struggle is not only between aristocratic and “commoner” elites but has been nationalized to include all levels of a deeply divided society. Like the coup of 2006, the recent military takeover has deepened Thailand's crisis instead of resolving it. This is unsurprising because neither were genuine attempts to break the impasse but were instead measures for the royalists to regain the upper hand.
The only way for Thailand to move forward is to hold free and fair elections, respect the votes of all Thais, and ensure that all sides accept the results. If, under the guise of “order” or “reforms,” the royalist junta continue to frustrate people's legitimate claims of suffrage then the prospects for Thailand look bleak. Any move to disenfranchise Thai voters could precipitate the most serious conflict yet. If this comes to pass then the bloodshed long thought to have been avoided in 1932 may simply have been delayed.

Top 10 Catchiest Songs (as proven by science) A team of UK scientists have come up with a list of the 10 catchiest songs ever Text Share Tweet Email
Normally, we'll peruse through our music collections, scour the internet for suggestions, read through musical books, and/or ask our readers for input before we put out a top list. There's no real science behind our methods...except for this one. Scientists over in London have come up with a list of the 10 catchiest songs of all time.
12 The science behind The Music
The London team recruited thousands of volunteers, and listened to them sing along to a selected list of tracks (hopefully more than 10). What they quickly discovered was that the catchiest songs each had four key elements in common:
1) They contained long and detailed musical phrases
2) The chorus (or hook) had several pitch changes
3) The singers were male
4) There was a noticeable higher male vocal level
11 In Dr Daniel Mullensiefen's words:
Every musical hit is reliant on maths, science, engineering and technology; from the physics and frequencies of sound that determine pitch and harmony, to the hi-tech digital processors and synthesisers which can add effects to make a song more catchy.
We've discovered that there's a science behind the sing-along and a special combination of neuroscience, maths and cognitive psychology can produce the elusive elixir of the perfect sing-along song.
We hope that our study will inspire musicians of the future to crack the equation for the textbook tune.

Italy is doomed to go the way of Germany and Sweden unless it finds a solution quickly to its sudden migrant “invasion” problem, before even more arrive:
The exodus from Libya to the Italian coast has continuing unabated with no visible action on the part of the Italian government or the European Union to halt it.
The Islamic State has expressed its plan to “conquer Rome” as central to its mission to “defeat Christianity.” An Islamic State video also warned that “Libya could be used as a springboard for attacks” in Italy. More problematic for Italy is that Libyan president Fayez al-Sarraj has been refusing to take back his own people who are sent back.
In April, Italy faced a similar crisis of migrants flooding in, and sent 6,242 migrants back home to North African countries.

Jermaine Jenas feels Steve McClaren has been “bought time” at Newcastle United – by in-form Georginio Wijnaldum.
McClaren's beat Liverpool 2-0 at St James's Park at the weekend – but the club is still in the drop zone.
The win has bought McClaren some time to save his job, but it won't count for much unless they find some consistency. Jermaine Jenas
Jenas – who also played for Sunday's opponents White Hart Lane Tottenham Hotspur – experienced highs and lows during his three years on Tyneside.
And the 32-year-old, now a pundit, has offered an insight into what it is like when things are not going well.
“The win has bought McClaren some time to save his job, but it won't count for much unless they find some consistency,” said Jenas.
Wijnaldum took his goal tally for the season to seven with a strike against Liverpool.
And Jenas said: “The man who gives me most confidence is Wijnaldum.
“When things are good at Newcastle – and I was at the club during some very good times – there's nowhere better to play football.
“But I also had a taste of when things were bad, and then it becomes a very tough place to play. The pressure that mounts on you from the fans is the equivalent of the huge support you get when things are great, but in reverse.
“I remember when I went to QPR they were fighting relegation, and before I joined a couple of their players warned me that the fans can get on top of you at Loftus Road when things are bad.
“I remember thinking it couldn't be anything like Newcastle, and it wasn't.
“When I was on Tyneside during tough periods, you could quite easily lose a few players to tight hamstrings and sore backs.
“Playing at home in front of 52,000 unhappy Geordies is not easy, and there's no hiding place. It's the easiest excuse for players to not play well, or in some cases not play at all.
“This is the kind of environment Newcastle's squad – many of them inexperienced in the Premier League – have found themselves in, but Wijnaldum has stood tall.
“What I love most is the responsibility he takes in that team. He's always available for the ball and prepared to receive it in tough areas.
“He doesn't just want the ball when he has space – he'll take it anywhere.”
SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) — An outbreak of listeria across three states, including California, has prompted a massive nationwide recall of frozen organic and non-organic vegetables.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list that includes 358 products under 42 different brands sold at grocery stores including Safeway, Trader Joe's and Costco. The products may be contaminated with deadly Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. The frozen fruits and vegetables on the list were sold in all 50 states and parts of Canada.
So far 8 people have been hospitalized. Two patients later died from other causes according to the CDC.
The items were packaged by CRF Frozen Foods in Washington state. The company issued a voluntary recall in April and suspended operations at its plant in Pasco. On May 4, CRF expanded the recall to include all of its organic fruits and vegetables.
Customers who purchased the products should throw them out or return them to the point of sale for a refund.
Products include but are not limited to: organic and non-organic broccoli, butternut squash, carrots, cauliflower, corn, edamame, green beans, Italian beans, kale, leeks, lima beans, onions, peas, pepper strips, potatoes, potato medley, root medley, spinach, sweet potatoes, various vegetable medleys, blends, and stir fry packages, blueberries, cherries, cranberries, peaches, raspberries, and strawberries.
The products were processed at the CRF facility since May 1, 2014 and have sell by dates between April 26, 2016 and April 26, 2018.
In a press release, CRF apologized to consumers for the inconvenience and warned:
“Listeria can cause “serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.”
Costco and Trader Joe's have issued recalls covering their affected products, as well.
The model O-R3 autonomous security robot manufactured by Singapore-based Otsaw Digital. (Otsaw Digital)
Mini autonomous police cars paired with companion drones and facial-recognition technology will begin patrolling the streets of Dubai by the end of the year to help identify and track suspects.
The announcement by city officials this week comes as Dubai races to reshape the future of its law enforcement.
But don't expect a high-speed chase out of the little cars. In demonstrations, the robot never appears to move beyond a stroll's pace. But the four-wheeled security vehicle comes with a built-in aerial drone that can be deployed to surveil areas and people that the robot can't reach.
Named the O-R3, the patrol car can navigate on its own using machine-learning algorithms, but police can control the robot remotely from behind a computer dashboard. The vehicle also comes equipped with thermal imaging and license-plate readers. The manufacturer, Singapore-based Otsaw Digital, claims the car-and-drone duo is the first of its kind.
The Dubai police force and Otsaw said the robots are intended not to replace human officers but to better manage resources and manpower — Otsaw touts that the vehicles can operate 24/7 and recharge themselves. “We seek to augment operations with the help of technology such as robots,” Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri, the head of the Dubai police, said in a statement. “Essentially, we aim for streets to be safe and peaceful without heavy police patrol.”
Last month, Dubai recruited the world's first police bot, tasked not with dispensing weaponized justice but with the more modest assignment of monitoring tourist attractions. The robot, dubbed “RoboCop,” speaks two languages — English and Arabic — but soon will speak four, officials said. But the electronic officer is just the first of many to come. Within the next few years, the city will introduce a nearly 10-foot-tall model, capable of speeds of almost 50 mph, that can also be controlled by a human officer from inside its frame and carry heavy equipment.
By 2030, Dubai plans for robots to make up 25 percent of its police force.
Purging a virus from organ transplants
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an extremely common virus, which as other members of the herpes virus family causes life-long infections in humans. Most individuals are exposed to HCMV during childhood, yet symptoms can be easily fought off by a healthy immune system. However, infections can be life-threatening for individuals with defective immunity, for instance newborn babies, people with AIDS, or those taking immunosuppressive drugs following organ transplantation. Scientists at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) have discovered the molecular switch that allows HCMV to either lie dormant or reactivate its infection. The switch can be manipulated with simple drugs to force the virus out of dormancy, making it easy to target with antivirals. Published in eLife, the study shows how HCMV could be fought in high-risk patients and purged from organs before transplantation. HCMV infects 60% of the population in industrialized countries, and almost everybody in less affluent places. This virus persists for life by hiding in blood-making ("hematopoietic") stem cells, where it lies dormant and goes completely unrecognized. It occasionally reactivates in the descendence of these hematopoietic stem cells, but these bouts are rapidly tamed by the immune system. However, in people whose immune system has been compromised, e.g. by AIDS, and organ transplant recipients who have to take immunosuppressive drugs, HCMV reactivation can cause devastating symptoms.
Throwing the switch
The lab of Didier Trono at EPFL discovered a protein that switches HCMV between dormancy and reactivation. They found this protein to be bound to the HCMV genome in latently infected hematopoietic stem cells and, upon a variety of external stimuli, to undergo a modification that allows for viral activation.
Furthermore, the researchers were able to control this switch with a drug called chloroquine, usually used against malaria. When they treated hematopoietic stem cells containing dormant HCMV with chloroquine, the virus reactivated and became exposed, opening the door to maneuvers aimed at eliminating virus-infected cells.
The simplicity of the study's design underlies its enormous significance. On one hand, it sheds light on the molecular mechanism by which HCMV becomes dormant in hematopoietic stem cells, possibly offering insights into similar infections by other herpes viruses. On the other hand, the study provides a straightforward method for forcing HCMV out of dormancy in infected tissue. Coupled with a simultaneous dose of an antiviral, this could become a standard regimen for eradicating HCMV from high-risk patients and purging it from tissue before transplantation.
Trono's team is now testing the method's efficiency in purging HCMV from cells to be used for bone marrow transplantation. Following that step, the group will be developing the first trials in humans.

Per the Los Angeles Times, part of the Rams' rookie orientation program this week involved a lecture from Mike Lutzenkirchen that turned the room silent.
Lutzenkirchen's son, Philip, tried out for the Rams in 2013 as a tight end following a standout career at Auburn. The following summer, Philip Lutzenkirchen and one other man were killed in an automobile accident. Both had blood-alcohol levels above the legal limit according to toxicology reports.
Mike Lutzenkirchen now speaks to various groups across the country about his son's accident and his memory.
“I'm just hoping…I can get one player that's doing something they shouldn't be doing, in any facet, to step back and evaluate,” Mike Lutzenkirchen said. “But more importantly, if I can get that teammate to step back there with you, because I'm not doing that and I'm not going to continue to let you do it, now you've got two people thinking about one bad error in life.”
The NFL replaced the annual rookie symposium this year with a mandatory two-day orientation for drafted and undrafted rookies at each team's facility.
Every team's rookies hang around at least an extra week following mandatory minicamp, and included in that time are various educational programs that include speeches from former players, lessons on money management and even etiquette classes.
Ex-player La'Roi Glover oversees such events for the Rams rookies as the team's director of player engagement.
“We're just trying to educate them,” Glover told the newspaper. “If I can put one extra tool in that toolbox, then it's a mission accomplished for the group.”
Sunday, June 7, 2015 Mass. General Hospital launches phase II trial of BCG vaccine to reverse type 1 diabetes FDA approval of trial testing generic vaccine announced at ADA Scientific Sessions
A phase II clinical trial testing the ability of the generic vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) to reverse advanced type 1 diabetes has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The approval of this trial, which will shortly begin enrolling qualified patients, was announced today at the 75th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) by Denise Faustman, MD, PhD, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Immunobiology Laboratory and principal investigator of the study.
The five-year trial will investigate whether repeat BCG vaccination can clinically improve type 1 diabetes in adults between 18 and 60 years of age who have small but still detectable levels of insulin secretion from the pancreas. Faustman's research team was the first group to document reversal of advanced type 1 diabetes in mice and subsequently completed a successful phase I human clinical trial of BCG vaccination. She announced the FDA approval to launch the phase II trial during her ADA presentation, “Low Levels of C-Peptide Have Clinical Significance for Established Type 1 Diabetes.”
“We have learned a lot since the early studies in mice – not just about how BCG works but also about its potential therapeutic benefits, similar to what are being seen in trials against other autoimmune diseases,” says Faustman. “We are so grateful to all of the donors, large and small, who have made this trial possible – especially the Iacocca Foundation, which has believed in us and has been a supporter since our early days. Our goal is to complete enrollment and also to raise the remaining funds needed for the trial by the end of this year.”
A generic drug with over 90 years of clinical use and safety data, BCG is currently approved by the FDA for vaccination against tuberculosis and for the treatment of bladder cancer. The vaccine is known to elevate levels of the immune modulator tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which Faustman's team previously showed can temporarily eliminate in both humans and mice the abnormal white blood cells responsible for autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Increased TNF levels also stimulated production of protective regulatory T cells.
In the phase I clinical trial, which was published in the August 8, 2012, issue of PLOS Medicine, two injections of BCG spaced four weeks apart led to temporary elimination of diabetes-causing T cells and provided evidence of a small, transient return of insulin secretion. The phase II clinical study will include more frequent dosing over a longer time period to determine the potential of repeat BCG vaccination to ameliorate the autoimmune state and improve clinical parameters such as HbA1c, a marker of average blood sugar control.
In the new trial, which will be double blinded and conducted at MGH, 150 adults with long-term type 1 diabetes will be randomized to receive two injections four weeks apart of either BCG or placebo and then a single injection annually for the next four years. Patients will be closely monitored over the five-year trial period. The primary outcome measure will be improved results on the HbA1c blood test, which have been shown to prevent complications.
“In the phase I clinical trial we demonstrated a statistically significant response to BCG, but our goal in phase II is to create a lasting therapeutic response,” says Faustman, an associate professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. “We will be working again with people who have had type 1 diabetes for many years. This is not a prevention trial; instead, we are trying to create a regimen that will treat even advanced disease. In addition to our phase I trial, we took guidance from the BCG clinical trials that are underway globally for other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.”
Lee Iacocca, founder of the Iacocca Foundation, says, “My family and I have been fortunate to be part of this research for many years. It is incredibly exciting to be talking about curing people, not mice. I made a promise to my late wife to find a cure for type 1 diabetes. Now my family and I look forward to the continued progress and are proud to support this effort to get closer to that goal.” The Iacocca Foundation provided major funding for the phase I trial and has taken a leadership role in funding the phase II trial.
More than $19 million has been raised out of a total of $25 million needed to conduct the phase II study over the next five years. Additional information about the clinical trial, including information for potential participants and financial supporters, is available at http://www.faustmanlab.org or by emailing DiabetesTrial@partners.org. Details on the trial and enrollment also are available at: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02081326.

The Sharks (30-16-2) defeated the Colorado Avalanche (13-30-2) in the second game of a home-and-home in Denver on Monday night by a final score of 5-2.
San Jose started off very slow, as the Avalanche took the first four shots of the game, but luckily for the Sharks, Martin Jones denied the early Avalanche attack. The Sharks finally recorded their first shot just under five minutes into the contest.
The Sharks then received their first power play at the 5:47 mark of the first period, but only managed two shots on goal during the man advantage. The Sharks entered the game with the 20th ranked power play in the league (16.9 percent).
The Sharks first major scoring chance of the first period came just past the 13:00 mark when Brenden Dillon slung a shot to the net, which was blocked by Nathan MacKinnon and ricocheted to Mikkel Boedker, but he missed the net wide.
San Jose kept their foot on the gas throughout the second half of the first frame, and the pressure finally paid off when Brent Burns lit the lamp for his 20th goal of the season. He received a pass from behind the net, and sent a beautiful wrist shot just outside the right face-off circle at a sharp angle that beat Avs goalie Spencer Martin with 59.8 seconds left in the first period. David Schlemko and Logan Couture picked up assists on the goal. The Sharks entered the game 23-7-1 when scoring the game's first goal.
Jones made an absolutely brilliant save a minute into the second period with a toe save on Carl Soderberg.
Following the Jones save on Soderberg, the two teams had just one shot a piece over the next seven minutes before Melker Karlsson picked up a two-minute minor at the 8:52 mark. The Avalanche tied the game at 1-1 when Jarome Iginla rocketed a one-timer past Jones on the power play.
San Jose dominated puck possession through the middle part of the second period, but were unable to net the puck. The Avalanche went through an eight-minute stretch without putting a shot on net.
After matching one another in the first period with nine shots per team, both teams put four shots on net in the second period to get each of their totals up to 13 shots on goal through 40 minutes.
The Sharks came out hot in the third period with a great shift by Karlsson's line, followed by the Captain Line as they generated four shot attempts, but only one got through to the Avs goaltender.
At the 17:07 mark Patrick Marleau netted his 13th goal of the season and his 494th of his career off of a shot by Marc-Eduoard Vlasic to grab a 2-1 lead for the Sharks. Boedker picked up the second assist.

Two minutes later, Martin denied Dillon from his first goal of the season on a 2-on-1 attempt by the Sharks to keep the Avalanche alive. However, Marleau wouldn't have anything with keeping the Avalanche in the game as he netted his second goal of the night on a backhanded wraparound. Burns and Couture picked up assists on the terrific finish.

Marleau just couldn't keep his name off the game log, however as he picked up a two-minute hooking penalty on his next shift, which the Sharks were able to kill off with ease.
Marleau came out of the penalty box and immediately was fed a beautiful pass by Joe Pavelski on a 2-on-1 and cashed in on it to complete the natural hat trick (in 7:42) and pushed the Sharks ahead 4-1. It was Marleau's first hat trick since Nov. 20, 2011, which was on the road against the Avalanche.
The Avalanche would jump back into the game with a goal by Nikita Zadorov even though there was an immense amount of goaltender interference happening in the Sharks goal crease. The Sharks challenged the goal, but the referees confirmed that the goal was a good goal.
San Jose received a two-man advantage shortly after the Avalanche goal, but the Sharks were unable to capitalize on the power play.
Once more, the man, the myth, the legend Patrick Marleau netted his fourth goal of the third period with a breakaway goal to retake a three-goal lead at 5-2. The last time an NHL player scored four goals in the third period was Mario Lemieux on Jan. 26, 1997.
A Joe Thornton hat trick for Patrick Marleau! pic.twitter.com/HmVNJFO7TW — San Jose Sharks (@SanJoseSharks) January 24, 2017
It marked Marleau's first career four-goal game of his career. He joined Tomas Hertl and Owen Nolan as the only players in Sharks history to score four goals in a game.
While the Sharks extended their winning streak to five games, the Avalanche fell to 2-15-1 in their last 18 games.
The Sharks will return to the ice tomorrow on the road tomorrow night against the Winnipeg Jets. Puck drop will be at 5:00 PM.
Notes
Joonas Donskoi left the game in the first period and headed to the locker room. Donskoi did not return to the contest.
Matt Duchene was a late scratch for the Avalanche as he had the flu. The Avalanche did not have an additional player at the ready, so they played with just 17 skaters.
Burns' 20th goal marked just the third 20+ goal season by a Sharks defensemen, joining himself (27 goalis in 2015-2016) and Sandis Ozolinsh (26 goals in 1993-1994).

Belgian police have arrested six British men driving three UK ambulances not far from Brussels, as the Belgian capital was on lockdown, with security agencies fearing a “serious and imminent” threat of a terrorist attack.
The medical vehicles, with British license plates, were spotted on Saturday at a service station in Bierges, along the E411 highway, 30 minutes southeast of Brussels.
Law enforcement officers arrived on the scene quickly at around 14:00 local time (13:00 GMT), supported by six armored trucks. A witness spoke to RTL Belgium, saying: “There were a number of police vehicles and the police officers had their weapons drawn.”
Six British nationals of Pakistani origin were arrested at the scene and were taken for questioning and had their fingerprints taken. No weapons were found, but police said they came across “clothes, food and money.”
“Those who were arrested appear to be part of a humanitarian convoy to Turkey, which would therefore mean they are not a terrorist threat,” a commissioner from the Wavre Police Force stated, as cited by RTL Belgium.

Belgian police said that the six British nationals were arrested near an Esso gas station, which was regularly frequented by Salah Abdeslam. A manhunt is under way to try and capture the 26-year-old who is wanted in connection with the November 13 Paris terrorist attacks.
The fact that suspicious-looking ambulances were seen in the vicinity of Brussels provoked a scare after reports saying terrorists in Germany had sought to launch an attack in Hanover using a medical vehicle.
On November 19, the German authorities were forced to call off a friendly football match between Germany and the Netherlands after learning of a detailed document that showed how a group of several terrorists planned to set off several bombs at the stadium in Hanover, while the match was being played.
The attackers planned to smuggle the bomb into the stadium using an ambulance.
The arrests by Belgian police came as the capital Brussels was in a state of lockdown on Saturday after the security agencies said city faced a “serious and imminent” threat of a terrorist attack. The government issued an official warning to the public to avoid crowded areas.
Brussels is still remained on high alert Sunday, with police searching for two terrorists involved in the Paris terror attacks.
The mayor of the Brussels municipality of Schaerbeek, Bernard Clerfayt, told Belgium's RTBF radio that the two terror suspects are in Brussels and "could commit dangerous acts," it was reported Sunday. Belgian police have been trying to track down Abdeslam for over a week now.

Salah Abdeslam returned to Brussels from Paris following the November 13 assaults. He managed to arrive back in the Belgian capital having evaded police three times. His elder brother Brahim blew himself up at a cafe in Paris.
Salah Abdeslam hails from the Brussels district of Molenbeek, which has been in the headlines over the past week as it was from this district in the Belgian capital where some of the terrorists who carried out the Paris attacks were living.
Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon says it is time for the government to take the necessary steps to tackle the problems of jihadism and radicalization in the area, while adding that they will check “every address in Molenbeek.”
"It is unacceptable that we do not know who is living in this area," he said in an interview with the Het Nieuwsblad newspaper. "There are two people registered in some apartments, but actually 10 living there.”
Jambon is calling for door-to-door searches to take place.
“The local authorities must go from door-to-door, ring the bell and ask who actually lives there. An address should be checked by a police officer when a person goes to live at a new abode,” the interior minister added, speaking to Het Nieuwsblad.
The reported destruction of two important manuscript collections by Islamist rebels as they fled Timbuktu is an offence to the whole of Africa and its universally important cultural heritage. Like their systematic destruction of 300 Sufi saints' shrines while they held Timbuktu at their mercy, it is an assault on world heritage comparable with the demolition of the Buddhas of Bamiyan by the Taliban in 2001.
The literary heritage of Timbuktu dates back to the 15th and 16th centuries when the gold-rich kingdoms of Mali and Songhai traded across the Sahara with the Mediterranean world. It took two months for merchant caravans to cross the desert, and while gold and slaves went north, books were going south.
In his Description of Africa, published in 1550, the traveller Leo Africanus marvels that in the bustling markets of Timbuktu, under the towers of its majestic mosques, the richest traders were booksellers.
They were selling manuscripts by Arab scholars on everything from astronomy and arithmetic to Islamic law, as well as mystical texts on Sufism, the otherworldly, saintly style of faith that the al-Qaida-affiliated Ansar Dine finds so offensive.
This legacy of Arab learning that goes back to the great scientists and mathematicians who preserved the classical Greek heritage in the early middle ages is richly represented in the manuscripts of Timbuktu – but not necessarily in its original form. For scribes copied and recopied books in this city that loved leaning, creating a legacy of works transcribed in the 18th and 19th centuries as well as earlier.
They also wrote down their own history and laws, chronicling the families of Timbuktu and preserving the poetry and stories of north Africa – at least, that is what seems to have lain in the many manuscripts of Timbuktu's lost legacy that were just starting to be properly conserved when this terrible religious vandalism plagued the city.
When European empires scrambled for Africa in the 19th century the continent was seen as illiterate and lacking in history, memory, or literature. Its art was seen as "primitive", partly because it lacked a written art history.
Timbuktu is a palimpsest in the sand that proves otherwise. Libraries like the Ahmed Baba institute were rescuing Africa's history from oblivion. Timbuktu is Africa's city of books and learning that disproved racist myths about the continent. That luminous inheritance is what the Islamists have destroyed.
It's been a bountiful month of lush giveaways, and instead of easing off, we're pushing the peddle down – the bike peddle that is! Thanks to San Francisco's Timbuk2 and their new Custom Prospect Laptop Backpack.
We've got a review in the works as we speak, so before then we'll take a snippet from Timbuk2 to fill you in on the Prospect…
“A weatherproof commuter bag. A bike-friendly power pack. A style-forward day pack. With top-to-bottom customizability, the Prospect can be whatever you want it to be.

Remember the big “we passed a health care bill” party at the White House? That happened two weeks ago. Mark Wilson/Getty Images
Donald Trump is committing gaffes and/or light treason with such preposterous frequency that even well-respected and extremely knowledgeable public intellectuals like myself are having trouble remembering everything that's going on. Time is dilating, just like Einstein said it could, as each moment is filled with more and more Trump news. Everything feels like it happened forever ago. For instance:
News broke that Trump told Russia's foreign minister and ambassador that James Comey was a “nut job” and that a current White House official is a “person of interest” in the Russia-Trump campaign collusion investigation.
Actually happened: Like 20 minutes ago.
Feels like it happened: This one still feels fresh.
Roger Ailes died.
Actually happened: Yesterday.
Feels like it happened: Wednesday.
News broke that Trump had told former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who has been asked to testify before Congress about the Russia investigation, to “stay strong.”
Actually happened: Yesterday morning.
Feels like it happened: Tuesday night.
News broke that Flynn had rejected a plan to seize ISIS' capital, Raqqa, that perhaps not coincidentally would have alienated the government of Turkey, which paid Flynn more than $500,000 last year through an intermediary.
Actually happened: Wednesday night.
Feels like it happened: Tuesday morning.
Trump complained to Coast Guard graduates that he is the most mistreated politician “in history.”
Actually happened: Wednesday afternoon.
Feels like it happened: Monday. Remember when we all started the week off by chuckling about how people like Abraham Lincoln had gotten a little more mistreated than Trump?
News broke that Trump told James Comey, before Comey was fired, that he hoped the FBI would stop investigating Flynn.
Actually happened: Tuesday at about 6 p.m.
Feels like it happened: Last week.
The New York Times published a story in which anonymous Trump advisers suggested that he couldn't possibly have given away valuable intelligence to Russia's foreign minister and ambassador because he doesn't actually know enough valuable intelligence.
Actually happened: Tuesday afternoon.
Feels like it happened: Two weeks ago.
News broke that Trump had blithely discussed said top-secret intelligence—which turns out to have come from Israel—with Russia's foreign minister and ambassador in an Oval Office meeting.
Actually happened: Monday night.
Feels like it happened: It simply does not compute that this story—about the president possibly blowing our decades-long relationship with Israel by blurting out top-secret national security information during a conversation with representatives of a foreign power that is widely known to be actively interested in sabotaging our government and is closely allied with more than one country that wants to see Israel wiped off the face of the planet—was only the second-biggest story during the week that it happened.
Trump tweeted a threatening message about possibly having “tapes” of his conversations with fired FBI director Jim Comey.
Actually happened: Last Friday morning.
Feels like it happened: 2015.
Trump admitted that he was going to fire Comey before deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ever wrote the memo about Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email case.
Actually happened: Last Thursday at around noon.
Feels like it happened: 2012.
The entire Trump administration, more or less, went on TV to claim that Comey had been fired because Rosenstein's memo recommended doing so.
Actually happened: Last Wednesday.
Feels like it happened: During the ‘90s. Friends was on.
Trump met with Nixon's national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, at the exact moment that everyone was comparing him to Nixon for firing the FBI director.
Actually happened: Also last Wednesday.
Feels like it happened: In an extra-temporal dream space in which the Nixon administration and the Trump administration are taking place at the same time—one as a sort of hollow made-for-TV recreation of the other.
Trump met with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador the day after firing his FBI director in what everyone assumed was an attempt to shut down an investigation into Trump's connections to Russia.
Actually happened: This, too, happened last Wednesday!!!
Feels like it happened: What a day, last Wednesday. A Wednesday that will live in infamy.
James Comey was fired.
Actually happened: Last Tuesday afternoon.
Feels like it happened: In the nineteenth century.
Sally Yates testified before Congress.
Actually happened: Last Monday.
Feels like it happened: I don't remember who Sally Yates is. Who is Sally Yates?
The House passed the American Health Care Act.
Actually happened: Two weeks and one day ago.
Feels like it happened: Milliseconds after the first inorganic compounds swirling in the ooze of ancient Earth spontanously replicated themselves—creating life where, before, there had been none.
We had a non-Trump president—one whose problem, if anything, was that he was too careful and deliberate.
Actually happened: Jan. 2009-Jan. 2017.
Feels like it happened: Pretty sure this didn't actually ever happen. Doesn't sound like the America I know.

Defensive end Jeremy Mincey started the year on one of the worst teams in the league, but was cut just as they were getting better.
Now, he's found his way onto one of the best.
The defensive lineman who was just released by the Jaguars has agreed to terms with the Broncos, according to Jeff Legwold of ESPN.com.
The Jaguars left him home from one road trip and deactivated him from another game for violating team rules, including missing meetings. After he returned to the field, they eventually cut the expensive mistake of the previous regime.
Mincey had some success under Jack Del Rio in Jacksonville, so the Broncos defensive coordinator may be able to convince him to show up on time for a playoff run. He's been a productive pass-rusher in the past, and any amount of that the Broncos can find is going to help given their recent struggles in the secondary.
A Home Without a Coleus Houseplant is not a Home!
Many of us have done gardening at some time in our lives and some have carried this hobby indoors. One plant which can spread beauty throughout homes or apartment is the Coleus. Easy to keep alive through even lengthy non attendance and very simple propagation techniques, it can bring much joy to the plant enthusiast.
The most popular is known as Coleus Hybridus (painted nettle) and a much more vibrant Coleus plant, simply called “Rainbow Mixed Colors” on the seed package, is unbeatable in color variations.
Because of the high level of regeneration of the Coleus plant, you could easily propagate a single nursery bought plant or one started from seed into several totally new plants.
It's simple! Once the plant has blossomed to beautiful foliage, cuttings can be taken. Trim 4 to 6 of the lower leaves close to the stem and place the cuttings in a jar or glass, about 1/3 filled with simple tap water.
Several plant cuttings can be placed in the same jar, but the water level will have to be monitored more closely. The Coleus gets pretty thirsty and could drain the water supply in a very short time.
Store in a low lighted area for several days, until roots are produced at the base of the cuttings. Wait until new roots have produced at least half a dozen and the longest have reached about 1″.
They are now ready to be transposed into a more permanent growing media. Choose the correct type of soil for your new botanical jewels.
Find soil that will grow your new cuttings and keep them in their healthiest state throughout their adult lives and produce the brightest of color variations in their ever changing leaf patterns.
The soil should contain the greatest amount of organic material as possible along with self contained nutrients.
Select a growing pot which would accommodate a progressive growing stage. You could probably begin with a 4″ wide pot. Each individual plant should have ample room to remain in this size pot for about 2 months.
When the Coleus has outgrown its original pot, it's time to move it to a bigger pot size. This should last for the rest of its natural life. The process can be started all over again and you will have a house full of these spectacular plants.
BANGKOK (Reuters) - With huge numbers of visitors and patchy law enforcement, Thailand has a booming black market for fake identity documents, and it was here that two passengers on a missing Malaysia Airlines jet were apparently able to get hold of stolen passports.
Thai authorities struggle to track thousands of lost or stolen passports each year. Some are known to be sold on through syndicates to drug traffickers. Others are suspected to have ended up in the hands of Islamist militants.
“Fake passports and identity fraud in general is a massive problem in Thailand,” police commander and Thailand's Interpol director Apichart Suriboonya told Reuters.
Sometimes documents are sold by their owners to cover travel costs, Apichart said.
They are passed on to middlemen, Thai or foreign, who work with criminal networks, he said. The passports may be altered, for example with a new photograph, but sometimes the fraudulent user hopes to pass as the real owner.
The passenger manifest issued by Malaysia Airlines included the names of two Europeans - Austrian Christian Kozel and Italian Luigi Maraldi - who were not on the plane. Both had passports stolen on the Thai holiday island of Phuket.
The passports were used to buy tickets from travel agents in the resort town of Pattaya, to Beijing and on to Europe. Thai and foreign investigators were questioning staff at one travel agent on Monday.
There is no evidence the plane's disappearance is linked to the two passengers travelling under the stolen passports.
Police showed Reuters a copy of Maraldi's passport used to make the travel booking with what was apparently the original photograph of Maraldi in it. It was not immediately clear if the tickets were bought online or collected.
Thailand's fake document business has been flourishing for years.
In 2010, Thai and Spanish authorities arrested suspected members of an international ring providing forged passports to militants. Thai authorities say the ring may have passed fake documents to those behind the Madrid train bombings in 2004.
Pockets of Bangkok are notorious counterfeit goods emporiums with fake drivers' licences, press cards and airline cabin crew identity cards on display. The Thai capital also boasts experts in forging visas.
“Thailand is fertile territory for people looking to steal European passports, there are lots of foreigners and many foreigners visit,” a European diplomat said.
“UNSAVOURY CHARACTERS”
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said more than 60,000 passports - both Thai and foreign - were reported missing or stolen in Thailand between January 2012 and June 2013.
Police in Phuket said Maraldi reported his passport stolen in June last year, while Kozel's passport was reported stolen in March 2012. Police said they get reports of up to 10 lost passports a month in the province.
Phuket police officer Angkarn Yasanop said foreigners can earn $200 (120.14 pounds) to sell their passport and then report it stolen. Many lost or stolen passports end up with Thais and other Southeast Asians trying to migrate for work, he said.
Larry Cunningham, who recently retired as Australia's honorary consul in Phuket, said a huge problem was tourists leaving passports as a deposit when renting jet-skis or motorbikes.
Crooked operators then make a false allegation of damage. The tourist, unwilling to pay, reports the passport stolen at an embassy on consulate and gets a new one. The old passport is sold on into the underworld.
“Phuket has some very, very unsavoury characters and they're not all Thais,” Cunningham said. “Nothing would surprise me about Phuket.”
Interpol's stolen and lost travel documents (SLTD) database contains 40 million records from 167 countries but its secretary general, Ronald Noble, says not enough countries are using it.
“The bad news is that, despite being incredibly cost effective and deployable to virtually anywhere in the world, only a handful of countries are systematically using SLTD to screen travellers,” Noble told a conference last month.
Apichart said Thai databases were not properly linked to Interpol data.
“The technology we use in Thailand to check fraudulent identity cards is outdated at many points of entry,” he said.
A multicopter complex armed with anti-tank missiles has been unveiled at a military robot conference near Moscow. Consisting of several drones, the complex is set to perform reconnaissance tasks, monitor the battlefield and eliminate targets.
The versatile airborne robotic complex has been developed by Sistemprom, an integral part of the United Instrument Manufacturing Corporation (Rostec). It was presented at the Russian Armed Forces Robotics conference at Kubinka's Patriot military expo, west of Moscow.
The system consists of four drones: a robotic helicopter, sentinel multicopter, reconnaissance multicopter, and an assault multicopter armed with “rocket-powered munitions.” The drones can perform tasks separately or as a joint task force.
“Sistemprom's hardware is called to replace [soldiers] effectively where it is possible, be it scouting, patrolling, monitoring, cartography, transportation and combat missions,” Sergey Skokov, Rostec's deputy director general, told RIA Novosti on Wednesday.
A group of drones could operate in a fully autonomous mode – establishing a position and keeping to a designated route, and also interacting with other robotic complexes.
Each component of the complex has specific capabilities.
The robotic helicopter has an operating range of hundreds of kilometers, can perform video surveillance, make meteorological observations, and deliver cargo to designated coordinates.
The reconnaissance multicopter collects video and photo material using a thermal imaging device, and passes the data in real-time mode to its control station.
The sentinel multicopter can adjust artillery fire, verifying a target's coordinates, and monitor the situation of the battlefield.
The assault multicopter is armed with unspecified “rocket-powered munitions.”
All the drones use the combined GLONASS/GPS navigation system for positioning, course bearing and target linking.
Another Rostec company, Vega Concern, has presented a modernized hardware and software robotic group control package capable of managing up to 10 UAVs and robots on the ground, acting as an integral task force.
The system's mobile control center is mounted on a vehicle with good cross-country ability, is equipped with crew stations for five operators, and could function autonomously for up to a week. Setting up the mobile control station takes less than 15 minutes.

Here's what the article said about Michigan:
"Far too much of the Michigan narrative centers on Detroit and its many issues. The Motor City's become a scrappily rising underdog you can't help but root for, but Michigan's greatest strengths lie in the state as a whole. Did you know Michigan has more coastline than any state other than Alaska? Did you know it has such an embarrassment of beer riches that you can easily hit Bell's and Founders in the same afternoon? Did you know the UP is so remote and uniquely beautiful that it almost feels like a secret 51st state where they inexplicably love British meat pies? Did you know most residents are more than happy to apologize for Kid Rock? If you answered yes to at least three of these than you already understand Michigan's charms. If you answered no to these questions, you should listen to the dulcet tones of Michigan tourism pitchman Tim Allen and get yourself there immediately."

Facebook is reportedly in talks with the federal government to allow it and other web companies to disclose basic information about data requests that would normally be kept secret under national security laws, according to All Things D. If successful, Facebook and other companies would apparently be given wider permission to publish details about sensitive requests — such as those that fall under FISA — including how many requests were made and granted, and how much information was handed over. Just this Tuesday, Google penned an open letter to the attorney general and the director of the FBI to make the very same request.
The tech giants need to save face
ATD caveats that the negotiations may not go anywhere due to the issue's sensitivity, but they do believe the discussions are being taken seriously. It's unclear if other parties are involved in the talks, however ATD specifically notes that Google — despite its common interest — is not a participant.
Should Facebook manage to push the government into allowing for more transparency in data requests, it and the other web giants that appeared on the PRISM slides may be able to save some face moving forward. Like Google's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg himself has publicly called on the government to allow for more transparency when it comes to data colleciton. And while some companies have chosen to publish "transparency reports" to give their users an understanding of how they handle data requests, as was revealed last week, those reports don't include large swathes of data that are barred from disclosure.
Update: AllThingsD now reports that in addition to Facebook, the government has also been in talks with Google to make FISA requests more transparent to the public. Sources say that the talks have reached an advanced level, though there is still the chance that nothing will come of them.
Enjoy Your View Here. I could sit there all day. Shooting against the sun. Looking to the north from the wooden look-out. At the end of the path. The iconic sight, in the year 2014. The Descent. One of my favourites of the series.
It's not the first time I've visited or photographed The Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lake shore. But it sure seems like every time I do I end up using different media to capture the iconic scenery: digital, 35mm black and white, or 120 format C41 process. This year I went up there with Fuji Velvia RVP50 slide film (E6), and the results are truly exciting. If you love these photographs, you'll wish you could see the physical slides themselves. I think these are some of the best photographs of the Sleeping Bear Dunes that I've captured, to date. What's next, perhaps 4×5? Who knows. But here's a link to the older sleeping bear post in C41 color if you are interested. Until next time.
“I've always loved getting clean,” says Piper Chapman, at the beginning of the first episode of “Orange Is the New Black.” We see a montage of Chapman, a blond, WASPy wild child, taking a bath as a little girl, then as an adult showering with her lesbian lover and, later, soaking in a tub with her boyfriend. “I love baths. I love showers. It's my happy place.” Then the camera cuts to her in prison, in Litchfield, New York, wearing improvised flip-flops beneath a measly drizzle of water. “Was my happy place,” she corrects herself.
Two episodes later, Piper is standing in line for the bathroom. “It's all yours,” Sophia Burset, the prison's transgender hairstylist, tells her. Piper really has to go, but there's a hitch: the stall has no door. “That's O.K. I think I'll wait,” she says. Sophia sizes her up: “Give it a week. You'll be pissing and farting with the rest of us.”
Harsh, right? But what if, instead of a lukewarm trickle, the water coming out of that shower were brown and smelled funky? What if the problem in the bathroom weren't the lack of privacy but rather that, every time someone flushed, her waste would surface in the neighboring stall? Those are some of the more than ninety complaints filed by inmates at the Riverhead correctional facility in Suffolk County, New York, where “Orange Is the New Black” has filmed scenes for its second season.
The New York Civil Liberties Union, seizing on the show's use of the Riverhead facility, launched a campaign called Humanity Is the New Black (or, sorry, #HumanityIstheNewBlack) to protest conditions at Riverhead and at Yaphank, another Suffolk County jail. “I think the NYCLU campaign is great,” Piper Kerman, whose memoir is the basis for the series, told me by e-mail. “Now that the second season has been launched, O.I.T.N.B. superfans know that there is a second season storyline about plumbing, disgustingly unsanitary conditions, and correctional corruption at Litchfield. So art does imitate life (and vice versa).”
The Humanity Is the New Black campaign is the latest push by prison-reform advocates, joining a lawsuit filed by the N.Y.C.L.U. and the law firm Shearman & Sterling on behalf of Suffolk County inmates that has been stalled for more than two years. People housed in the Riverhead facility, according to the lawsuit, are forced to live with overflowing sewage and amid black mold, rust, and rodent infestations. “This is really unhealthy from top to bottom,” Corey Stoughton, an N.Y.C.L.U. staff attorney and a counsel on the case, told me. “You add up the daily task of living in that environment, and it's just beyond what any human being should have to bear.”
As I reviewed about a dozen of the inmates' handwritten grievances, provided to me by the N.Y.C.L.U., a pattern quickly emerged: the water is undrinkable, the inmates write; the stench rising up from the sewers is revolting; they feel sick. Many refer to what they call the “Ping-Pong bathrooms”—a term that is explained in a complaint filed in 2011 by a fifty-year-old man: “The next cell backs up into mine, when I wake up throughout the night there are feces and urine in my toilet.” He adds, “I've complained to officers number of times.” Another inmate writes, “I am constantly being exposed to other inmates human bodily waste I am in cell #9.” A third inmate states, “I have been drinking the water here and came to realize it's the problems I'm having with throat, stomach and lung.” Another complains of “rashes and hard skin on my back and feet from the water in the shower.” His complaint ends with a request: “I wish to seek help from medical please as soon as possible.”
Michael Sharkey, the chief of staff in the Suffolk County sheriff's office, told me in response that, while he couldn't address specific complaints because of the pending lawsuit, “All jails in New York State are monitored by the New York State Commission of Correction. You have to meet their standards, and we consistently meet their standards.”
The problem, as criminal-justice reform activists view it, is not only one of substandard conditions but of scope. Almost seven million people are incarcerated at adult correctional systems across the country, according to a Department of Justice report released last year. About one in every thirty-five adult Americans has been under some form of correctional supervision, with black males more than six times as likely as white males to be incarcerated. (In Suffolk County, black people represent seven per cent of the general population but forty per cent of the inmates.) Seventeen hundred inmates, on average, are housed at the Suffolk County correctional facilities—a short drive that may as well be light-years away from the nearby Hamptons. The facilities serve as jails, not prisons, which means that they are locally financed and locally operated. They are also supposed to be temporary. And yet expanded jail construction in the state of New York had cost taxpayers an estimated billion dollars by 2008. A study by the Center for Constitutional Rights states, “In many counties, these projects have been the largest financed capital project in the history of the county.”
Adam Gopnik, in an article about U.S. prisons published in the magazine in 2012, writes that, for the poor in America, and particularly for poor black men, prison is as much a fact of life as college is for rich white people. “Mass incarceration on a scale almost unexampled in human history is a fundamental fact of our country today—perhaps the fundamental fact, as slavery was the fundamental fact of 1850,” he writes. “The more professionalized and procedural a system is, the more insulated we become from its real effects on real people.”
It's these effects—on real people, not merely as a Hollywood backdrop—that the N.Y.C.L.U. is focussing on. Talking about the Riverhead inmates, Stoughton asked me, “Why are they there? By and large, they're there because they couldn't make bail, because they're poor. And if they had five hundred dollars or fifteen hundred dollars to post bond, they wouldn't have to be there.” In a video testimonial, Jason Porter, a thirty-three-year-old former inmate, describes enduring thirty hours during which sewage floated freely on the jail's floors and “all over the walls, the cells, the ceilings.” He summed up by saying that, at Riverhead, “It's almost inevitable: you're going to get something.”
“You would think that that would be on the TV show, not in real life,” Stoughton replied when asked about Porter's account. She told me that she had binge-watched the first season of “Orange Is the New Black,” and she praised the show's creators for the nuanced ways in which they portray the characters. “They get that people in jails are human beings that deserve to be treated like human beings,” she said. The frustration that she and the inmates had with the show was not that it was filmed at the Riverhead facility but with what they consider the misguided policies of the Suffolk County authorities. “You have this county that's on the one hand making money off of, and wooing, Hollywood, and then you have this reality—and the reality puts fiction to shame.”

Yesterday, Pharrell and Scott Vener's Beats 1 Radio Show OTHERtone shared a preview of today's episode which features hip-hop and electronic producer Flying Lotus as a special guest. As FACT Mag shared earlier today, the clip starts out with Vener posing the question to FlyLo: I don't mean this as a provocative question, but do you think hip-hop is in a good place right now, like lyricist-wise? To this, the big-grinned California producer can only chuckle before responding, "Yeah, absolutely."

Pharrell then jumps in to point out "every generation" usually has a negative view of the music genres that are being shaped by the generation younger than them. The three then go on to examine the ongoing shifts in hip-hop and which direction it appears to be growing in. Watch above.

Examination of the question of how long have Aborigines been in Australia.
How long have Aborigines been in Australia? The answer commonly given is 40,000 years. Depending on which evolutionist is telling the story though, it could be 50,000 or 60,000 years—or even longer.
It should be remembered that such claims are always based on many assumptions (beliefs which cannot be proved to be true). In respect of radiocarbon dating, for instance, it is assumed that the earth's production and decay of radioactive carbon are in balance (as long-age theory says they should be, but observation says they are not). A radiocarbon ‘age' of say 30,000 years may thus actually represent a true age of only a few thousand years. When this erroneous age is assumed to be true, it is then used to assign an even older date to something found at a lower level, and so on.
Underpinning everything, of course, is the theory of evolution and its passengers. As the archaeologist Professor Brew put it, ‘If a C-14 date fits our theories, we put it in the main text. If it does not entirely contradict them, we put it in a footnote. And if it is completely "out of date", we just drop it.'1
It is instructive to visit a site such as the famous Kakadu National Park in Australia's Northern Territory, where the well-known ‘X-ray' style of rock paintings can be found. Modern house paint lasts only a handful of years, yet the visitor to rock-painting sites is told that many of these applications of a simple mixture of ochre and water are tens of thousands of years old!
Rapidly fading
Some of these ‘ancient' paintings have had a silicon strip or dripshield applied around their rim to deflect water run-off, as they have been observed to erode quickly when it rains.
Of course, they may have been touched up from time to time, but to assume this happening consistently for tens of thousands of years further begs the question of whether these great ages are real. In fact, in another part of the same park one finds paintings of Europeans smoking pipes, and of sailing ships. The photo on bottom left of page 48 shows a Kakadu painting of a rifle.
Naturally, everyone is forced to accept these as ‘recent'. The incongruity is glibly passed over by referring to it as the ‘world's oldest unbroken record of continuity of art' or something similar. But the creationist explanation, that all the paintings are at most several centuries old, fits the facts at least as well—with no awkward contradictions like the fact that these rock paintings are seen to erode quickly in the absence of manmade dripshields.
Reasoning in circles
Evolutionists sometimes say that at least some of the Kakadu paintings must be tens of thousands of years old, because they show animals which became extinct tens of thousands of years ago. It seems obvious, however, that one evolutionary assumption is being used to prop up another. It is perfectly feasible that the animals in question only became extinct a few centuries ago.
Evolutionists are forced to ignore or downplay other evidence that the Aborigines have been here for a much shorter time-span. For example, many Aboriginal tribes have legends—long pre-dating their contact with missionaries—of a global Flood, sometimes with astonishing parallels to Scripture.2
There are also other Aboriginal stories which appear to be corrupted memories of the time before they separated from other peoples at Babel—for example, accounts of the creation of man and woman, and the dispersion of tongues at Babel. The stories of one tribe insist that this incident happened not in the Middle East, but near Cooktown, in Australia's Far North Queensland.3 Not surprisingly, they have no cultural memories of Jonah and the fish, or of Moses crossing the Red Sea; it all ends with Babel, and they didn't get it from the missionaries.
An ‘ancient' art gallery discovered recently in Australia's remote north-west Kimberley region has caused its evolutionist discoverer to postulate that more than a thousand years ago, some Christian seafarers must have reached the tribe. A newspaper article mentions only that the art is ‘closely linked with Christianity'. In personal correspondence, the discoverer would only reveal that the art contained motifs of ‘the Great Flood and the rebirth of the people from one family'.4
If in fact it turns out that there are no post-Babel stories in this ‘biblically inspired' rock art, the theory that they were inspired by early Christian contacts would be hard-pressed to explain this. Why no New Testament motifs, for instance? It would be much easier to explain as just one more example of the Aborigines' memory of the Flood.
Racism refuted
Modern biology has also revealed that the old evolutionary racist belief, that Aborigines have large biological differences from Europeans because of long periods of isolation, is no longer tenable. God has indeed ‘made of one blood' all nations of men; it is now common knowledge that the genetic differences between all the various races are so minor that they can be represented as a series of very closely overlapping circles.
Unfortunately there is a strong emotional component to this issue of the Aborigines' allegedly long stay. The perception is that 40,000 years somehow makes the Aborigines' dispossession more immoral than if they had been here for only 2,000 or 3,000 years. The ‘ancient' theme has also become closely linked, in Australia, with black pride and land rights, not to mention the added mystique (and therefore commercial appeal) when marketing such things as Aboriginal art and souvenirs. Even Aboriginal rock music of late has been given the ‘40,000 years' hype treatment to help it sell.
Under such ‘fashionable' social pressure, it is no wonder that each new ‘dating' of the Aborigines seems to just keep growing older and older.
In reality, the weight of evidence is consistent with the fact that the Aborigines, as descendants of Noah's family,5 and thus close cousins to the rest of humanity, have been here only a few thousand years—certainly less than four thousand.
1952 called; it wants Cardinal Raymond Burke back.
And it can have him.
From Religion News Service:
[O]ne of the most outspoken critics of Pope Francis' push for reform is roiling the waters yet again, this time arguing that the Catholic Church has become too “feminized.”
More than 30 years after the Vatican began allowing choir girls to help priests during Mass, Ray Burke still misses the traditional sausage-fest. He wants his choir boys.
“Young boys don't want to do things with girls. It's just natural,” Burke said in an interview published on Monday (Jan. 5). … “I think that this has contributed to a loss of priestly vocations. It requires a certain manly discipline to serve as an altar boy in service at the side of [a] priest, and most priests have their first deep experiences of the liturgy as altar boys.”
Feel free to head-desk along with me. After the explosion of pedophilia scandals that have thrown the Catholic Church into turmoil for decades now, it takes a certain linguistic cluelessness for His Eminence to refer to what boys don't want to do with girls and to speak of “deep experiences” with altar boys.
But wait, there's more.
“If we are not training young men as altar boys, giving them an experience of serving God in the liturgy, we should not be surprised that vocations have fallen dramatically,” Burke said.
Of course. That the Church has an increasingly well-known history of pedophilia, rape, and other crimes against children would have nothing to do with falling applications.
In the interview, Burke also blamed gay clergy for the church's sexual abuse crisis, saying priests “who were feminized and confused about their own sexual identity” were the ones who molested children.
One of the most interesting pieces of religion news from 2014 was that Burke had been ousted as the Vatican's second-in-command, and demoted.
Not to worry, Cardinal: in my eyes, you'll always be a number two.
Walmart CTO Jeremy King. Walmart Okay, so maybe the deals weren't so great on Amazon Prime Day or Wal-Mart's same-day online sale. Still, perhaps take a moment to consider everything that goes on behind the scenes to make online shopping happen.
Consider this:
In addition to all the web traffic that a company like Wal-Mart has to deal with, there are all kinds of complex wizardry that goes into wrangling a tremendous amount of data — millions of items, their prices, customer recommendations, warehouse availability — into a website that you can actually search and buy stuff from.
This is why four years ago, Wal-Mart opened its Walmart Labs division in the heart of Silicon Valley's Mountain View, not far from Google, LinkedIn, and Yahoo.
It started from Wal-Mart's acquisition of a 65-person search-and-analytics startup called Kosmix in 2011, but now it employs 2,200 "technologists" — developers, engineers, data experts, and the like — to solve the retailer's biggest digital problems.
"When you build a product for Wal-Mart, millions of people see it," says Wal-Mart SVP and Chief Technology Officer Jeremy King, who heads up Walmart Labs.
Walmart.com sees "millions of transactions" every day, he says. And when you give smart people access to the data and resources they need, you get "magic," King says. It's not a word he uses lightly.
"I'm a big Ayn Rand fan, and magic is a bad thing in that world," King says.
Online and offline were separate worlds
Wal-Mart has had a technology presence in northern California since the year 2000, but at that point, the company's site and its stores were a total mismatch: Not every item from the stores was available online, and even Wal-Mart's internal item numbers weren't consistent between the stores and the website.
It made life difficult for customers and Wal-Mart alike, especially as Amazon's star continues to rise. Around 2011, Wal-Mart CEO Mike Duke knew it was time to take action and attack ecommerce sooner rather than later, or else risk getting overshadowed.
He wanted developers.
Walmart CEO Mike Duke. King, then at eBay, joined after a personal recruitment pitch from Duke, who was looking for someone a little more entrepreneurial to shake things up.
It was an aggressive approach — Duke was supportive and wanted to give Walmart Labs whatever it needed to work, but his attitude was something like "don't call home until you get results," King recalls.
It wasn't long before King realized that stuff had to change on the back end, he says. The company was using a mishmash of different technologies, some of it outsourced to outside vendors and some of it not.
They were collecting massive pools of customer data, but it was just sitting there, unused.
"We have to dump these vendors," King recalls thinking early on in his Wal-Mart career.
And that's what they did, opting to build their own systems that could connect developers to data (though a Wal-Mart spokesperson was quick to note that it still engages with vendors on stuff like storage and networking).
King boasts that Wal-Mart is one of the earliest and biggest users of Apache Hadoop, the hot data-crunching technology that businesses big and small are making use of to build better, smarter applications.
Similarly, when it came to building out a cloud to efficiently support all of the traffic coming to the site, Walmart Labs became one of the first big users of OpenStack, a free cloud technology that's still finding its way into the traditional enterprise.
The important part, King says, is that whatever they build, they build it themselves — often contributing the things they've learned back to the developer world as open source. Plus, the promise of working with hot technologies at huge scales is a great recruitment pitch, he says.
"You can't outsource innovation," King says. "It's important to own and build it at that scale."
The advantage is that Wal-Mart's developers are closer to the data and closer to the systems that actually support Wal-Mart's customers every day.
The Walmart Labs office. Walmart Wal-Mart data scientists have come up with complex math that can algorithmically ensure that the website meets the retailer's famous low-price guarantee — if the software detects a lower price somewhere, it automatically lowers it, King says.
Plus, the data means that they can optimize Wal-Mart's logistics, too, King says. If a lot of people in one area are ordering, say, diapers, Walmart.com's software can detect that and allocate more diapers to that area's warehouses.
"In the end, you need to build a team that has daily access to the life of the customer," King says.
Walmart Labs has no direct place in the brick-and-mortar operation of the company, King says, but he has a "great relationship" with Wal-Mart CIO Karenann Terrell. And as the lines between ecommerce and in-store shopping get blurrier, they're working together closely.
"To make that kind of change, it's not Walmart Labs sitting in the corner," King says.

One of the most important questions for every educated Catholic of today is: What is to be thought of the theory of evolution? Is it to be rejected as unfounded and inimical to Christianity, or is it to be accepted as an established theory altogether compatible with the principles of a Christian conception of the universe?
We must carefully distinguish between the different meanings of the words theory of evolution in order to give a clear and correct answer to this question. We must distinguish (1) between the theory of evolution as a scientific hypothesis and as a philosophical speculation; (2) between the theory of evolution as based on theistic principles and as based on a materialistic and atheistic foundation; (3) between the theory of evolution and Darwinism; (4) between the theory of evolution as applied to the vegetable and animal kingdoms and as applied to man.
Scientific hypothesis vs. philosophical speculation
As a scientific hypothesis, the theory of evolution seeks to determine the historical succession of the various species of plants and of animals on our earth, and, with the aid of palæontology and other sciences, such as comparative morphology, embryology, and bionomy, to show how in the course of the different geological epochs they gradually evolve from their beginnings by purely natural causes of specific development. The theory of evolution, then, as a scientific hypothesis, does not consider the present species of plants and of animals as forms directly created by God, but as the final result of an evolution from other species existing in former geological periods. Hence it is called "the theory of evolution", or "the theory of descent", since it implies the descent of the present from extinct species. This theory is opposed to the theory of constancy, which assumes the immutability of organic species. The scientific theory of evolution, therefore, does not concern itself with the origin of life. It merely inquires into the genetic relations of systematic species, genera, and families, and endeavours to arrange them according to natural series of descent (genetic trees).
How far is the theory of evolution based on observed facts? It is understood to be still only an hypothesis. The formation of new species is directly observed in but a few cases, and only with reference to such forms as are closely related to each other; for instance, the systematic species of the plant-genus Œnothera, and of the beetle-genus Dimarda. It is, however, not difficult to furnish an indirect proof of great probability for the genetic relation of many systematic species to each other and to fossil forms, as in the genetic development of the horse (Equidæ), of ammonites, and of many insects, especially of those that dwell as "guests" with ants and termites, and have adapted themselves in many ways to their hosts. Upon comparing the scientific proofs for the probability of the theory of evolution, we find that they grow the more numerous and weighty, the smaller the circle of forms under consideration, but become weaker and weaker, if we include a greater number of forms, such as are comprised in a class or in a sub-kingdom. There is, in fact, no evidence whatever for the common genetic descent of all plants and animals from a single primitive organism. Hence the greater number of botanists and zoologists regard a polygenetic (polyphyletic) evolution as much more acceptable than a monogenetic (monophyletic). At present, however, it is impossible to decide how many independent genetic series must be assumed in the animal and vegetable kingdoms. This is the gist of the theory of evolution as a scientific hypothesis. It is in perfect agreement with the Christian conception of the universe; for Scripture does not tell us in what form the present species of plants and of animals were originally created by God. As early as 1877 Knabenbauer stated "that there is no objection, so far as faith is concerned, to assuming the descent of all plant and animal species from a few types" (Stimmen aus Maria Laach, XIII, p. 72).
Passing now to the theory of evolution as a philosophical speculation, the history of the plant and animal kingdoms upon our globe is but a small part of the history of the entire earth. Similarly, the geological development of our earth constitutes but a small part of the history of the solar system and of the universe. The theory of evolution as a philosophical conception considers the entire history of the cosmos as an harmonious development, brought about by natural laws. This conception is in agreement with the Christian view of the universe. God is the Creator of heaven and earth. If God produced the universe by a single creative act of His will, then its natural development by laws implanted in it by the Creator is to the greater glory of His Divine power and wisdom. St. Thomas says: "The potency of a cause is the greater, the more remote the effects to which it extends." (Summa c. Gent., III, c. lxxvi); and Francisco Suárez: "God does not interfere directly with the natural order, where secondary causes suffice to produce the intended effect" (De opere sex dierum, II, c. x, n. 13). In the light of this principle of the Christian interpretation of nature, the history of the animal and vegetable kingdoms on our planet is, as it were, a versicle in a volume of a million pages in which the natural development of the cosmos is described, and upon whose title-page is written: "In the beginning God created heaven and earth."
Theistic vs. atheistic theories of evolution
The theory of evolution just stated rests on a theistic foundation. In contradistinction to this is another theory resting on a materialistic and atheistic basis, the first principle of which is the denial of a personal Creator. This atheistic theory of evolution is ineffectual to account for the first beginning of the cosmos or for the law of its evolution, since it acknowledges neither creator nor lawgiver. Natural science, moreover, has proved that spontaneous generation—i.e. the independent genesis of a living being from non-living matter—contradicts the facts of observation. For this reason the theistic theory of evolution postulates an intervention on the part of the Creator in the production of the first organisms. When and how the first seeds of life were implanted in matter, we, indeed, do not know. The Christian theory of evolution also demands a creative act for the origin of the human soul, since the soul cannot have its origin in matter. The atheistic theory of evolution, on the contrary, rejects the assumption of a soul separate from matter, and thereby sinks into blank materialism.
The theory of evolution vs. Darwinism
Darwinism and the theory of evolution are by no means equivalent conceptions. The theory of evolution was propounded before Charles Darwin's time, by Lamarck (1809) and Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire. Darwin, in 1859, gave it a new form by endeavouring to explain the origin of species by means of natural selection. According to this theory the breeding of new species depends on the survival of the fittest in the struggle for existence. The Darwinian theory of selection is Darwinism—adhering to the narrower, and accurate, sense of the word. As a theory, it is scientifically inadequate, since it does not account for the origin of attributes fitted to the purpose, which must be referred back to the interior, original causes of evolution. Haeckel, with other materialists, has enlarged this selection theory of Darwin's into a philosophical world-idea, by attempting to account for the whole evolution of the cosmos by means of the chance survival of the fittest. This theory is Darwinism in the secondary, and wider, sense of the word. It is that atheistical form of the theory of evolution which was shown above—under (2)—to be untenable. The third signification of the term Darwinism arose from the application of the theory of selection to man, which is likewise impossible of acceptance. In the fourth place, Darwinism frequently stands, in popular usage, for the theory of evolution in general. This use of the word rests on an evident confusion of ideas, and must therefore be set aside.
Human evolution vs. plant and animal evolution
To what extent is the theory of evolution applicable to man? That God should have made use of natural, evolutionary, original causes in the production of man's body, is per se not improbable, and was propounded by St. Augustine (see SAINT AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO, under V. Augustinism in History). The actual proofs of the descent of man's body from animals is, however, inadequate, especially in respect to paleontology. And the human soul could not have been derived through natural evolution from that of the brute, since it is of a spiritual nature; for which reason we must refer its origin to a creative act on the part of God.

White Hall, Ala. — In rural Lowndes County, Ala., on March 5, a dozen people gathered in the yard of a small, white frame house here to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of “the original Black Panther Party.”
Most have heard of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, the Black nationalist and socialist organization anchored in California. From 1966 to 1982, the BPP sponsored armed citizen defense against police violence as well as uplifting social programs for its community. Before the surveillance, harassment and assassination carried out by the FBI's infamous counterintelligence program (Cointelpro), the BPP had offices in 68 cities and thousands of members.
The seedbed of that revolutionary organization was in the Lowndes County community of White Hall — population 831 — and in the house that served as headquarters for the local SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) voting rights campaign. SNCC grew out of a 1960 student meeting organized by Civil Rights and economic justice activist Ella Baker at Shaw University in Raleigh, N.C., and was a catalyst throughout the South for grass-roots, militant voter rights organizing.
In 1966, SNCC and local activists formed the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, an all-Black, independent political party that ran a slate of Black candidates in county elections. All Alabama parties had visual symbols on the ballot. The Alabama Democratic Party had the logo of a white rooster with the words, “White supremacy for the right.” That language was not removed until 1996.
The LCFO chose a ferocious black panther for its symbol, saying it represented “courage, determination and freedom,” so the organization began to be known locally as “the Black Panther Party.”
LCFO handbills on voting rights contained the seeds of the later BPP Ten-Point Program, as the organizers announced they would set up local health clinics and called for adequate community nutrition. When Kwame Touré (Stokely Carmichael) and other SNCC members in the Lowndes County campaign went on to California organizing, they asked local activists if they could use the Black Panther Party name in their new organization, the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.
‘The Panther is not dead!'
From the front steps of the SNCC Freedom House, Willie Ricks (Mukasa Dada), a former SNCC member who organized in Lowndes County, said: “This little, small, country place is a historic place. The panther is not dead.” He affirmed the Black Panther Party spirit still lives in the Black Lives Matter movement. Dada had coined the phrase “Black Power” in a famous interchange with Touré.
Dada also honored those who gave their lives in the struggle — from Viola Liuzzo to Che Guevara — and spoke of the struggle's roots in Africa: Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa. He acknowledged the socialist and nationalist leadership of Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Léopold Senghor of Senegal, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Sékou Touré of Guinea as part of an African and socialist revolution. He stated that the liberation of people of African descent would come only with the freeing of the entire continent of Africa from imperialism and capitalism.
He concluded, “Reparations for the people who built the world up and got nothing for it! If we want freedom, we have to fight for freedom.“
Dada told of the armed struggle necessary to defend voting rights for the 95 percent Black population in Lowndes against white supremacy. SNCC workers went to the plantations ready with weapons in order to register voters. People who tried to vote were evicted from their homes by plantation owners. When evictees built a “tent city” by the side of U.S. Highway 80, the housing was repeatedly shot up by the Klan.
Dada said, “If anyone was attacked, we ran to them.”
When SNCC workers first arrived in Lowndes, they flagged down a school bus bringing children of the Black community home from their segregated school. They asked the driver, John Jackson, 16, if they could ride from house to house with him, to let people know SNCC was opening voter registration. Jackson took them to his father.
Matthew Jackson, a farmer, armed them and assigned his children and grandchildren as their aides. Jackson senior also gave them the frame house for their use, located next to the Jackson family home of 100 years. Its central breezeway had been used as a schoolhouse for the Black community's children before any public education had been allowed them.
Roots of resistance
The support of the Jackson family and other local activists comes from deep roots of resistance in Lowndes County — a resistance in the area going back to the Indigenous peoples of the Creek Confederacy.
A historical marker at the road to the SNCC Freedom House announces a nearby 1813 “Battle of Holy Ground,” where U.S. troops defeated a Creek uprising. What the marker doesn't say is that the battle at Ikan Atchaka/Econachoca (“sacred ground”) was a key moment when the Redstick Movement of the Creek nation militarily resisted the U.S. imposition of slavery and property ownership on their region and society. In this battle, Creeks and self-liberated Black people fought together against the U.S. troops. (tinyurl.com/zlmag9d)
During the 18th and 19th centuries, all five major Southern nations or confederations of Indigenous peoples — the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek (Muscogee) and Seminole — were subjected to a strategy of “civilization” by the U.S. that tried to make some members of the nation into slaveholders, thus dividing the people through unequal levels of property ownership.
As soon as slavery was introduced into the U.S. Southeast, enslaved people began to liberate themselves by escaping to swampy lands near the Alabama River to live in “maroon” lands and secret encampments of Native peoples.
Though no direct connection can be traced, it seems possible that the appeal of the black panther to local Lowndes County people might rest in its Indigenous roots — the fact that the Panther gens, the Katsalgi, was one of the primary Creek social units. In folk narratives, the panther is sometimes featured as a leader or commander of other animal peoples. (native-languages.org)
Certainly militant resistance by oppressed people continued even as slavery and white supremacy became entrenched as the law of the land. In 1861, in Lowndes and Montgomery counties, a hundred enslaved people of African descent, together with “poor whites of the country,” planned a rebellion in which they would redistribute the “land, mules and money” of the plantation owners. Twenty-five Black and four white insurrectionists were executed when the plot was discovered. (Herbert Aptheker, “American Negro Slave Revolts,” International Publishers, 1943)
The struggle for economic as well as racial justice arose again in the 1930s in Lowndes County when the Sharecroppers Union (SCU), organized primarily by the Communist Party USA, led 6,000 members in Lowndes, Macon, Montgomery and Dallas counties. In 1935 the SCU conducted a spring cotton-choppers' strike and a summer cotton-pickers' strike to counter wages of $4 a month, plus board, and to stop mass evictions of the workers to consolidate land for mechanized farming. Demands included equal pay for women and no discrimination against Black people.
Repression in Lowndes County was brutal, with floggings, rapes and assassinations of union organizers and supporters. However, “armed strikers organized their own ‘posses' and in one instance a group ‘met the vigilantes as they started to raid a striker's shack. When the [boss'] gang saw the opposition was formidable, they ran, and since then the raids have not been so frequent.'” (Robin D.G. Kelley, “Hammer and Hoe: Alabama Communists during the Great Depression,” University of North Carolina, 1990)
This long, long tradition of resistance showed up the night SNCC called the first meeting for voter registration in Lowndes County. A room full of Black farmers showed up — armed. When told that SNCC was “a nonviolent organization,” an older farmer replied, “You turn the other cheek, and you'll get handed half of what you're sitting on.“ (Kelley)
Southern native Minnie Bruce Pratt cast her first vote in Alabama in November 1966 — for the Black Panther Party.

A scientific paper published today proposes that e-cigarettes could cut smoking-related deaths in the U.S. by more than 20%, based on a statistical model of how people smoke and vape.
Referring to what it calls “vaporized nicotine products” or VNPs, it says that it models the impact of VNP use on public health “in terms of how it alters smoking patterns among those who would have otherwise smoked cigarettes and among those who would not have otherwise smoked cigarettes in the absence of VNPs.
“The model incorporates transitions from trial to established VNP use, transitions to exclusive VNP and dual use, and the effects of cessation at later ages.”
And it concludes that “based on current use patterns and conservative assumptions, we project a reduction of 21% in smoking-attributable deaths and of 20% in life years lost as a result of VNP use by the 1997 US birth cohort compared to a scenario without VNPs.
“Under most plausible scenarios, VNP use generally has a positive public health impact. However, very high VNP use rates could result in net harms.”
Pointedly, and apparently referring to one of the major criticisms that e-cig advocates level against research which purports to find that vaping increases the prevalence of nicotine addiction among youth, it notes that “previous models of VNP use do not incorporate whether youth and young adults initiating VNP would have been likely to have been a smoker in the absence of VNPs.”
By contrast, “this study provides a decision-theoretic model of VNP use in a young cohort that incorporates tendencies toward smoking and shows that, under most plausible scenarios, VNP use yields public health gains.”
Also important in the study, according to its authors, is the use of national rather than regional data, and a distinction between regular vaping and casual trial of e-cigarettes.
“Our model is consistent with recent evidence that, while e-cigarette use has markedly increased, cigarette smoking among youth and young adults has fallen dramatically,” lead author David Levy of Georgetown University in Washington, DC, said in a statement.
The paper, “The application of a decision-theoretic model to estimate the public health impact of vaporized nicotine product initiation in the United States”, is published in the journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research and authored by a U.S./Australian/Canadian team.
What This Means: We will publish a much more detailed examination of this study in the near future. For now, it's worth noting that it goes to the public-health heart of the policy debate – in a world where smoking exists, are e-cigs good, on balance, or bad? – and also worth observing that it is a theoretical modelling, albeit one based on real data, rather than a recording of absolute fact.
For both these reasons, it is likely to gain considerable attention, critical and welcoming.

Officially, the V8 twin-turbo BMW M5 F10 makes exactly 560 hp. With the Competition Package, the power increases to 575 hp, and there are approximately 300 vehicles from the 30-year-M5 Edition with 600 horsepower.
There is no question the eight-cylinder turbo has potential for more power output, so it comes with no surprise that the folks over at Sport Auto got their hands on a tuned up F10 M5 producing 649 horsepower.
The BMW M5 F10 with Competition Package sends 74 more hp to the rear wheels therefore it delivers increased performance around the track. Thanks to the Competition Package, the M5 comes with a revised limited-slip differential on the rear axle which increases the driving dynamics and cornering.

Sport Auto took this F10 M5 around the legendary track and they recorded a lap time of 7:53 minutes, 11 seconds faster than the stock Competition Package M5.
The Mercedes E63 AMG S-model with 585 hp and four-wheel drive was recently timed at 7:55 minutes, while the Audi RS 6 Avant was last tested with 8:05 minutes.
On the Hockenheimring, this BMW M5 F10 LCI achieved a time of 1:13.0 minutes, four tenths ahead of the stock M5 and five and eight tenths ahead of the previously mentioned competition.

Up to now, we've had many, many stories about the Iraq War. But most of them are stories of patriots fighting zealots, with the difficult history and messy present of Iraq put deep in the background. The Sheriff of Babylon, Vertigo's superb miniseries, switches it around; ostensibly a story about an American law enforcement consultant investigating a murder, instead it's the Americans in the background, and the day-to-day realities of Baghdad front and center.
Tom King, the author, would know. A former operations officer in the CIA's Counterterrorism Center, King spent years immersed in the culture and politics of countries we rarely think about unless they turn up on CNN. There are no Osama Bin Ladens in King's take on Iraq, simply people using labels as a matter of convenience to gain influence and money. The result is a complex depiction of a country very different from the foreign country invading it in the particulars, yet helplessly influenced by how that country sees it, and how that perception drives money and power. To say nothing of the personal consequences, as we see in this preview…

Photo by Tom Olmscheid/Workingpress Photo Agency Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk during Friday's special session.
It looked like the setting for a mock legislative session: Instead of desks and nameplates on the floor of the Minnesota House, there were theater-style seats assigned by slips of sticky paper, while a small lectern stood in for the Speaker of the House's usual podium. There was a gallery for the public to watch, though it only had 20 seats. And there was a version of the Abe Lincoln portrait that usually hangs at the center of the chamber and watches over proceedings, though it was a miniature one.
However it seemed, though, it was all very real: the setting for a historic, one-day 2015 special legislative session.
The usual Capitol chambers were closed down in the midst of a messy restoration project, so legislative staffers retrofitted a ground-floor hearing room in the State Office Building to look like a miniature version of the Minnesota House. Down the hall, a similar room had been set up for the Senate, where they imposed the same strict dress code and rules of decorum that senators are required to follow in the Capitol chamber.
“Members, we are making a bit of history today,” House Speaker Kurt Daudt said at the start of session, noting that this is the first time in 110 years a special legislative session has been held outside the halls of the state Capitol.
In the end, though, the odd setting of the proceedings was almost more notable than the final outcome — despite the hours of drama involved in getting to a resolution. After weeks of negotiations, lawmakers sealed the deal early Saturday by approving three budget bills.
While there was uncertainty throughout the day about passage of an agriculture and environment budget, lawmakers ultimately passed a bill that honored their leaders' original agreement on a 38-29 vote, after ping-ponging the bill between the House and Senate chambers throughout the day.
Legislators also passed a $17 billion education budget that spends $525 million more on schools over the next two years, as wells as a jobs and energy bill. All together, the three budget bills account for roughly half of the state's $42 billion two-year budget. A bonus: Legislators rounded up enough votes to pass a Legacy amendment funding bill and a $373 million total package of construction projects, two non-essential budget measures that ran out of time on the final night of the regular session.
The whole affair stretched from Friday morning into early Saturday morning and averts a partial government shutdown. Nearly 10,000 state government workers had already received layoff notices in the mail in case legislators didn't reach a deal by June 30, the last day of the fiscal year. Saturday morning, Gov. Mark Dayton said he will sign the final bills.
Rifts in the DFL
But the back-and-forth drama of the session exposed serious rifts between some Democrats — and left much business unfinished.
Tensions were particularly high in the Senate, where a majority of DFL members opposed the final agriculture and environment bill that was negotiated by their leader, Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk. Those senators were upset with provisions in the bill that rolled back long-time environmental protections and eliminated the nearly 50-year-old citizens' board of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.
The first attempt to pass the bill, on Friday afternoon, failed in the Senate by a single vote, with very few DFL votes and fewer Republicans votes than had originally supported the bill. Bakk went back to the drawing board — and to his caucus — and emerged with a new plan: offering amendments to the bill that could win DFL support.
Sen. John Marty, DFL-Roseville, the lead opponent of the agriculture and environmental budget, amended the bill to restore the MPCA's citizens' board and eliminate a provision that would exempt mining sulfide waste from solid-waste rules. The bill passed, garnering many of the Senate DFL votes the previous version didn't.
But Republicans complained that Democrats were backing away from a deal they had made with Dayton and other caucus leaders: to not support any amendments to the budget bills.
In the House, Republicans quickly took up the new bill — and amended it back to the way it was under the original deal, before sending it back over to the Senate for a final vote. “We are honoring the commitment we made to Minnesotans with the four legislative leaders and the governor,” Daudt said. “Now the Senate has the opportunity to do the right thing and send this bill to the governor.”
The final vote in the Senate ultimately passed, but not without Bakk having to make a deal with Senate Republicans behind closed doors to give them “significant, specific tax reductions” in a 2016 tax bill, Senate Minority Leader David Hann said.
“The new agreement calls for substantial Republican tax cuts to be added to already-planned reductions in the existing bill,” he said. “We're very satisfied with the concessions made by Democrats to deliver significant tax cuts in the next legislative session.”
Much to do
The conclusion of the legislature this year leaves much up in the air for next session. Legislators left nearly $1 billion of a $1.8 billion budget surplus on the bottom line to deal with those tax cuts, as well as a long-term transportation funding plan sought by Democrats. Those topics failed to gain traction in divided government this year.
Dayton also didn't get his number one priority, universal preschool education, and plans to continue his push next year.
A lawsuit could be looming as well over a change that would allow county governments to go around the state auditor's office and seek private companies to do annual reviews. The provision was one of the final sticking points in special session negotiations between Dayton and House Republicans.
“Our office is currently pursuing all avenues,” said auditor spokesman Jim Levi.
Another Alabama football player is taking up a spring sport.
Linebacker Keith Holcombe recently joined the Crimson Tide baseball team after finishing his second season with Nick Saban's squad. A 37th-round draft pick (1,110th overall) out of Tuscaloosa's Hillcrest High School in 2014, Holcombe is listed as an outfielder on Alabama's roster.
Fellow defenders Tony Brown and Marlon Humphrey ran track last year.
Holcombe was an all-state baseball player in high school. As a senior, he hit .467 with 86 hits, 55 runs and 31 stolen bases. As a pitcher, he had an 8-2 record with a 3.68 ERA and 43 strikeouts.
"I think for Keith, I think, baseball's not's done," Hillcrest coach baseball coach Mark Garner told AL.com in 2014. "There's been so many open doors just from this year that Keith has been able to look at for down the road and in the future and everything. It's going to be exciting to see how football and baseball mesh together in his future."
After redshirting his first football season at Alabama, Holcombe made an impact as a special teams player in 2015. His blocked punt early in the SEC Championship Game win over Florida set the tone in a low-scoring first half. Holcombe made eight total tackles as a redshirt freshman with five coming on special teams.
Holcombe drew top reviews from linebacker Reggie Ragland during 2015 spring practice.
"Now in a couple of years, that's who everybody needs to watch out for," Ragland said. "He's going to be a stud for us."
Just how Holcombe manages his time between the baseball team and spring football remains the top question as the season approaches.
Alabama opens the rebuilt Sewell-Thomas Stadium at 6:30 p.m. on Feb. 9 against Maryland.
Louis Nix is scary.
Some nights, he slaps on a "Saw" mask, go out on the Notre Dame campus, jumps out from behind bushes and scares students. When a 330-pound nose guard leaps out at you, your pancreas tends to leap out of you. One poor girl cried. "I've had campus police called on me," Nix admits.
Which is weird, since Nix loves nothing more than to laugh.
One Halloween, he dressed as Jesus Christ, and as he walked around he'd freeze every 20 feet or so into a Touchdown Jesus pose.
The question is, can he save Notre Dame?
Louis Nix is a monster.
Louis Nix didn't go pro because his mom, Stephanie Wingfield, wanted him to get his degree. Stephanie Wingfield
He could be a monstrous problem for 10-point favorite Alabama in this BCS title game on Jan. 7 in Miami. He's the size of a British phone booth, with the feet of a flamenco dancer, and the hands of a silversmith. He was as movable as the Lincoln Memorial during huge Irish fourth-quarter goal-line stands against both Stanford and USC this season.
He'll be up against Crimson Tide All-Galaxy center Barrett Jones. If Jones can handle Nix, Alabama can run to its third BCS title in the past four seasons. If Nix can handle Jones, Notre Dame can become the first team to go from unranked to national champs since BYU in 1984.
Of course, most people think Jones and Alabama will win, because most people think any SEC team could beat anybody, up to and including the 1972 Miami Dolphins.
"I don't listen to the SEC hype," says Nix. "I could've been an SEC player. All those schools recruited me. I've got friends who play in the SEC. They tell me it's about like it is here, except they say they don't do much school stuff at all. I tell him, 'Man, this [expletive] at Notre Dame ain't no joke.'"
Nix hasn't had much trouble. He's on schedule to graduate next December with a film, theater and TV degree, in three and a half years.
From there, it's on to the NFL, then to a career in movies and TV, where he wants to be on both sides of the camera.
He's big enough to do it.
Louis Nix is a banana.
He bruises easily. On the inside, not out.
When he was a boy, he wasn't allowed to play Pop Warner because he was always too big for his age group. Actually, too big for any age group.
"I'd explain it to him," says his mom, Stephanie Wingfield. "He'd look kinda hurt. And he'd say, 'OK, but I don't think it's right.'"
If you think Nix is big now, you should've seen him when he was an Irish freshman. He was half a cheeseburger away from 370 and about as fit as a LoveSac. He couldn't even get through a single workout.
He's lost 40 pounds since then, and yet there was a fan this season in Norman, Okla., who kept yelling from the stands: "Nix! You're fat! Fat!"
"The worst part was when I checked him out, he was fat," Nix says. "That hurt me. Man, we big guys gotta stick together."
Nix looks in a mirror and sees an elf. Others see Santa.
"Sometimes he'll look at me and put on his puppy dog face and say, 'I'm fat,'" says his girlfriend, Kiah Schaefbauer. "And I always hold him and tell him, 'No, Boo Boo Bear, you're not fat. You're just big-boned.'"
When Nix weighs in each week, it's as if the Pope is about to take a steam bath.
"It involves a whole lot of movements," Nix admits. "I don't let anybody see what I weigh."
ND cornerback Bennett Jackson says it doesn't matter. "He's so wide, we can't see the scale anyway."
Louis Nix is a quarterback.
In his mind, that is. His little brother once wrote an entire paper on what a good quarterback he is, and Nix tells coach Brian Kelly it's up to him to make sure that the kid isn't wrong.
"I guarantee I'd score if you put me at quarterback," he was telling Kelly the other day. "Guarantee it! Who's going to stop me? I'm [puts his hand over his mouth] pounds!"
Of course, Nix's chance of getting behind center would improve greatly if he'd stop going on Kelly's own radio show and making fun of the way Kelly turns purple when he's yelling at him.
Louis Nix is a mama's boy.
He could've turned pro at the end of this season and started making seven digits, but he didn't for a very good reason: His mom told him not to.
"I want him to get his degree," says Wingfield, a hospital cafeteria worker in Jacksonville, Fla.
Maybe more than that, she wants to walk with him on Senior Day next season. She didn't get to be there for his high school senior day because she had to work. Nix was the only player on the team that night without a parent.
So she'll be there in South Bend next November, even if they have to wheel her out on the field. See, she needs two new knees, but without any health insurance, she can't afford it. Nix says he plans to pay for it as soon as he turns pro, so now she's just going to have to wait a year.
"I've hopped around this long," she scoffs. "I can keep hopping."
Louis Nix is happy.
"He butts dials me all the time," says Kiah. "But he also plays tricks on me. So I have to listen for a while. The other day, I could hear him singing and singing. He must've sang at the top of his lungs for two minutes, all by himself in his room. I loved just listening to him singing his heart out."
Louis Nix is on.
Nix is a big man with big plans. Cal Sports Media/AP Images
He calls himself Irish Chocolate and his "Chocolate News" videos are a YouTube hit, whether he's interrupting QB Everett Golson practicing keyboards or catching Kelly as he's leaving surgery for a herniated disc in his lower back. ("They added two inches to me," he told Nix.)
"Louis talks to anybody he tackles," says teammate Prince Shembo, a linebacker. "We'll tackle some running back and he'll be like, 'You REALLY nice.'"
Nix likes to lay on them "stomach-to-stomach," as he says, jabbering straight into their helmets.
He was doing that last year to Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck until Luck turned the tables. After a particularly teeth-rattling hit, Luck looked up and went, "Ooooh. Nice hit! Nice hit!"
Nix got off him, laughing, using Luck's helmet as a brace.
Louis Nix is not going home again.
He wants to take his big bones and make a big living in the NFL (New England's Vince Wilfork is his favorite player), but he absolutely doesn't want to play for his favorite team, his hometown Jacksonville Jaguars.
"I don't want to go home and work. It's hard to be successful with so many people hanging around you."
Can you imagine? Just in his family alone, Nix has 13 siblings and half-siblings, five still at home, one only 14 months old.
He says he's happy to help them all -- but from another zip code.
Until then, he'll help his mom out the way he always does during vacations and the offseason: taking odd jobs like mowing lawns, moving furniture and cleaning buildings.
"He watches out for me," says his mom.
Louis Nix is on the verge of a very big step.
Two weeks ago, he asked Kiah what she wanted for Christmas.
She held his hands, looked into his eyes, and said, "A ring."
Nix's nonstop mouth suddenly ... stopped.
"He just looked at me, like, 'Oh, my God. Is she serious?'" says Kiah, who then threw up her hands and said, "Oh, no! Not THAT kind of ring. A BCS championship ring!"
You talk about scary.
Google has filed a complaint with European regulators alleging that Microsoft has violated competition laws by waging a proxy patent war against Android. Google hasn't made the complaint available to the press, but a statement from the search giant alleged that "Nokia and Microsoft are colluding to raise the costs of mobile devices for consumers, creating patent trolls that sidestep promises both companies have made."
"They should be held accountable, and we hope our complaint spurs others to look into these practices," the statement said.
While Google itself has not been the target of many Android-related patent lawsuits (and recently prevailed in its fight with Oracle), the company alleges that the threat of lawsuits against companies that manufacture Android handsets are creating an unfair advantage for Microsoft's own Windows Phone platform.
A Google spokesman told Bloomberg that the complaint focuses on the transfer of 2000 patents to a litigious firm called Mosaid Technologies. According to Google, Microsoft has publicly pledged not to assert those patents against competitors, but is now attempting to get around that promise by passing the patents to a third party who is not bound by the same promise. Google says Microsoft and Nokia are entitled to a share of Mosaid's licensing revenues.
The complaint is a "desperate tactic," according to Microsoft. "Google is complaining about patents when it won't respond to growing concerns by regulators, elected officials and judges about its abuse of standard-essential patents, and it is complaining about antitrust in the smartphone industry when it controls more than 95% of mobile search and advertising," the Redmond giant said in a press statement.
A Nokia spokesman called the complaint "frivolous," insisting that it was not abusing standards-essential patents and that Microsoft and Nokia manage their patent portfolios independently.
The EU is investigating Motorola Mobility, which was recently acquired by Google, for allegedly abusing standards-essential patents related to mobile phone technology.
Florian Mueller, a blogger with financial ties to Google's opponents, claims that the United States International Trade Commission has already dismissed similar charges.
Legal scholars have told Ars that patent thickets are uncharted territory for antitrust law. In an interview last year, Michael Carrier of Rutgers-Camden Law School pointed to potential collusion between Microsoft and Nokia as an antitrust trouble spot. However, he said, "the Department of Justice is sometimes slow to catch up to the realities of how patents are used in the industry." That might be why the fight is largely playing out in the European Union.
But by the late 1960s, the younger viewers networks prized were spurning corn pone, and Mr. Griffith had decided to leave after the 1966-67 season to make movies. CBS made a lucrative offer for him to do one more season, and “The Andy Griffith Show” became the No. 1 series in the 1967-68 season. But Mr. Griffith had decided to move on, and so had the times. “Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In,” with its one-liners about drugs and Vietnam , and “The Mod Squad,” about an integrated trio of undercover officers, were grabbing a new audience.

But the characters in “The Andy Griffith Show” — Barney ( Don Knotts ), Gomer (Jim Nabors), Opie ( Ron Howard , who went on to fame as a movie director), Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) and the rest, including Gomer's cousin Goober Pyle (George Lindsey, who died in May) — have remained tantalizingly real to their fans, who continue to watch reruns on cable TV and online.
Andy Griffith was more complex than Andy Taylor, although the show was based on his hometown, Mount Airy, N.C. Before he fetched up in Mayberry, he was known for bringing authenticity to dark roles, beginning with the lead in “A Face in the Crowd,” in 1957, the story of a rough-hewn television personality who, in the clutches of his city-slicker handlers, becomes something of a megalomaniac.

From the 1970s to the 1990s, Mr. Griffith starred in no fewer than six movies with the words “murder” or “kill” in their titles. In 1983, in “Murder in Coweta County,” he played a chillingly wicked man who remains stone cold even as he is strapped into the electric chair.
Sheriff Taylor aside, Mr. Griffith was no happy rustic; he enjoyed life in Hollywood and knew his way around a wine list. His career was tightly controlled by a personal manager, Richard O. Linke.
“If there is ever a question about something, I will do what he wants me to do,” Mr. Griffith told The New York Times Magazine in 1970. “Had it not been for him, I would have gone down the toilet.”
Far from the gregarious Andy Taylor, Mr. Griffith was a loner and a worrier. He once hit a door in anger, and for two episodes of “The Andy Griffith Show” he had a bandaged hand (explained on the show as an injury Andy received while apprehending criminals).
But the show's 35 million viewers would have been reassured to learn that even at the peak of his popularity, Mr. Griffith drove a Ford station wagon and bought his suits off the rack. He said his favorite honor was having a stretch of a North Carolina highway named after him in 2002. (That was before President George W. Bush presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005.)
He was also gratified to find his character ranked No. 8 on TV Guide's list of the “50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time” in 2004. ( Bill Cosby 's Dr. Cliff Huxtable was No. 1.) But one honor denied him was an Emmy Award: he was nominated only once, for his role in the TV movie “Murder in Texas.” “The Andy Griffith Show” itself, though nominated three times, also never won an Emmy, but Mr. Knotts did — five times — for his performance as Deputy Fife, and so did Ms. Bavier, once, as Andy's aunt.
Andy Samuel Griffith was born in Mount Airy on June 1, 1926, the only child of Carl Lee Griffith and the former Geneva Nann Nunn. His father was a foreman at a furniture factory. Mr. Griffith described his childhood as happy, but said he never forgot the pain he felt when someone called him “white trash.”
After seeing the trombonist Jack Teagarden in the 1941 film “Birth of the Blues,” he bought a trombone from Sears, Roebuck & Company, then wheedled lessons out of a local pastor, who later recommended him to the University of North Carolina , where he won a music degree and married Barbara Edwards.

He moved on to singing, and for a while hoped to be an opera singer. He tried teaching music and phonetics in a high school but left after three frustrating years. “First day, I'd tell the class all I knew,” he told The Saturday Evening Post in 1964, “and there was nothin' left to say for the rest o' the semester.”
In spare moments Mr. Griffith and his wife put together an act in which he posed as a country preacher and told jokes (one was about putting frogs in the baptismal water) while she danced. They played local civic clubs.
In 1953, performing for an insurance convention, Mr. Griffith, in his bumpkin preacher persona, told a comic first-person tale about attending a college football game and trying to figure out what was going on. Some 500 discs of the monologue were pressed under the title “What It Was, Was Football,” and it became a hit on local radio. Mr. Linke, then with Capitol Records, scurried to North Carolina to acquire the rights and sign Mr. Griffith.
Mr. Linke was soon guiding him onto television and nightclub stages. But Mr. Griffith's big break came on Broadway, in 1955, when he was cast in “No Time for Sergeants” as a mountain yokel drafted into the Air Force — a role he had played on television, on “The United States Steel Hour.” The play was a hit, running for almost two years, and he reprised the role for the 1958 film version.

His first movie role, in “A Face in the Crowd,” was far more complicated. The character, Larry Rhodes , known as Lonesome, is a vagrant who is discovered playing the guitar in an Arkansas jail and then groomed to become a beloved television star, only to be undone by his dark side. Mr. Griffith told The New York Times Magazine that he was so consumed by the stormy character that it affected his marriage.
“I'll tell you the truth,” he said. “You play an egomaniac and paranoid all day and it's hard to turn it off at bedtime. We went through a nightmare.”
In 1959, Mr. Griffith returned to Broadway in the musical comedy “Destry Rides Again,” in a role that had been played in films by Tom Mix, James Stewart, Joel McCrea and Audie Murphy. Though reviews were mixed, Newsday declared, “There isn't a more likable personality around than Andy Griffith.”
The pilot of “The Andy Griffith Show,” in February 1960, was actually an episode of “The Danny Thomas Show” in which Mr. Thomas, as Danny Williams, is arrested by a sheriff for running through a stop sign while driving through Mayberry.
Danny baits the sheriff, calling him “hayseed” and “Clem.”
“The name ain't Clem, it's Andy, Sheriff Andy Taylor!” he responds.

Sheldon Leonard , producer of Mr. Thomas's show, had decided to build a sitcom around Mr. Griffith after seeing him in “Destry.” Mr. Griffith negotiated for 50 percent ownership, which gave him a large say in the show's development.
Critical to the show's success was the casting of Mr. Knotts as the inept but lovable Barney Fife. So was the simple but appealing formula: characters would confront a problem, then resolve it by exercising honesty or some other virtue.
When Mr. Knotts left the show in 1965, a year after Mr. Nabors, Mr. Griffith became “nervous” about its future, he said. But though some critics and viewers said the show in its later years lacked the sparkle it had once possessed, its ratings never tottered.
Still, after the 1967-68 season, Mr. Griffith had had enough and left the show. But he did produce a kind of sequel series for the following season, “Mayberry R.F.D.,” with Ken Berry starring as a widowed farmer alongside many of the regular characters from “Andy Griffith.” It ran three seasons.
Mr. Griffith's acting career stalled afterward, despite a five-year deal with Universal Pictures. He said he was not offered roles he wanted to play. Returning to television in 1970, he starred in two short-lived shows, “The Headmaster” and “The New Andy Griffith Show.”
Then came a raft of made-for-TV movies. One, “Diary of a Perfect Murder,” served as the pilot for a new series, “Matlock,” in which Mr. Griffith played a rumpled but cagey defense lawyer. The show's run, from 1986 to 1995, exceeded that of “The Andy Griffith Show.”
Mr. Griffith continued to play occasional movie and television parts, including that of an 80-something widower who rediscovers romance, and sex, in a nursing home in “Play the Game.”
He never lost his singing voice. In 1996 he recorded a gospel album, “I Love to Tell the Story: 25 Timeless Hymns,” which won a Grammy .

In 2010 he showed a political side when he extolled President Obama 's health care legislation in a television commercial for it. Republican politicians and conservative talk show hosts leapt on him, and Jon Stewart made boisterous fun of the brouhaha on “The Daily Show.”
Mr. Griffith's marriage to Barbara Edwards, in 1949, ended in divorce in 1972. An eight-year marriage to the Greek actress Solica Cassuto ended in divorce in 1981. In 1983, he married Cindi Knight, who survives him, as does a daughter from his first marriage, Dixie Griffith. A son from his first marriage, Andy Jr., known as Sam, died in 1996.
To viewers, Mr. Griffith's portrayal of the sheriff seemed so effortless, they presumed he was just playing himself. He wasn't, he insisted; he was always acting. But he took that misimpression as a compliment to his artistry.
“You're supposed to believe in the character,” he said. “You're not supposed to think, ‘Gee, Andy's acting up a storm.' “
State senate passes bill by overwhelming 31-17 and critics say it's the most discriminatory of similar legislation across the south
A bill that would allow businesses and public employees in Mississippi to deny service to same-sex couples because of their religious beliefs passed the state senate on Wednesday night. Senators voted 31-17 in favor of the Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act.
Georgia governor vows to veto religious freedom bill Read more
Similar bills have been introduced in North Carolina and Georgia. Since signing the the bill into a law, North Carolina's governor Pat McCrory has come under fire from LGBT activists and large US companies such as Apple, Google and Bank of America. Georgia governor Nathan Deal said he would veto his state's law.
LGBT activists say the Mississippi bill is the most discriminatory yet. It seeks to protect beliefs that marriage is a union between a man and a woman; that “sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage”; and that sex is determined by anatomy and genetics at birth.
The bill, HB1523, will now go back to the Mississippi house, which is expected to vote in its favor a second time, having passed it in February by an 80-39 vote. The bill will then head to the desk of Mississippi governor, Phil Bryant, who is expected to sign it into law.
“I don't think it's discriminatory,” the governor told WLOX TV earlier this week. “I think it gives some people, as I appreciate it, the right to be able to say: ‘That's against my religious beliefs and I don't need to carry out that particular task.'”
Opponents of the bill say it will allow open discrimination against LGBT people. For example, under the law a florist or caterer could decline to work on a same-sex marriage or a doctor could refuse to provide counseling, sex-reassignment surgery or fertility treatment. Schools and companies would be able to set, in the words of the bill, “sex-specific standards or policies concerning employee or student dress or grooming”.
Clerks could also decline to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, skirting federal law.
“I think it sets a state's ability to decide who they want to serve, who they want to discriminate against,” Charlie Osborne, a protester against the bill, told WLOX after joining others at the state capitol in Jackson on Tuesday. “It's a slippery slope.”
Nykolas Alford, another protester, said: “This [bill] is like Jim Crow for the gays.”
Justin Nelson, president and co-founder of the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, said: “Religion is being used for the most immoral purpose possible: the denigration of entire populations to second-class citizens based entirely on fear and propaganda.
Gay marriage declared legal across the US in historic supreme court ruling Read more
“This is the most broadly discriminatory bill we've seen introduced, and should serve as a shocking reminder to anyone not yet convinced that the fight for equality in America continues long after marriage rights have been granted by the United States supreme court.”
Mississippi state senator Jennifer Branning, who introduced the bill, said it was written as a response to the supreme court case that legalized same-sex marriage last summer.
“This is presenting a solution to the crossroads we find ourselves in today as a result of Obergefell v Hodges,” she said. “Ministers, florists, photographers, people along those lines – this bill would allow them to refuse to provide marriage-related business services without fear of government discrimination.”
Branning also insisted that the bill “takes no rights away from anyone” and is “not a bill to allow any type of discrimination at all”.
So you're lying in bed, waiting for the alarm to go off, when you start smelling the wonderful aroma of bacon sizzling in a pan.
A little strange, since you're the only one home, but totally pleasant nonetheless. How is it possible?
With a new mobile device from the creative minds at the "Oscar Mayer Institute for the Advancement of Bacon."
The Wake-Up and Smell the Bacon device plugs into the headphone jack of an iPhone, and when it's activated, the device emits a small puff of the scent of bacon, with the accompanying sizzle sound.
Bacon lovers — and who isn't? — can start applying Thursday to get the device for free; it won't be sold in stores and quantities are limited.
"With nearly two million mentions of #bacon on Instagram, it seems people never get tired of bacon," said Tom Bick of Oscar Mayer in a news release announcing the device. "Oscar Mayer is thrilled to bring the first-ever, bacon-scented mobile device to market, giving bacon aficionados a new reason to welcome their morning alarm clocks."
Bacon fans can apply to win one of the devices each day from now through April 4, by going here.
Those who aren't lucky enough to get a device can still download a free app for the sound of sizzling bacon, along with amusing bacon sayings, or "baconisms."
Last year, the Oscar Mayer Institute for the Advancement of Bacon came out with an e-commerce site, Say It With Bacon, in time for Father's Day.
The comments are the latest in a back-and-forth feud between the two potential 2016 hopefuls. | AP Photos Paul slams Christie on Sandy ads
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) took an implicit swipe at newly reelected New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie Wednesday when he criticized the use of federal funding to air post-Sandy television ads.
At a Senate hearing on Sandy recovery efforts, Paul asked Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan whether it was appropriate for Sandy aid money to be used to air the ads — and while Paul never named Christie, it was a clear reference to ads made by the state of New Jersey in which Christie appeared after the devastating Oct. 2012 hurricane.
Story Continued Below
“Some of these ads, people running for office put their their mug all over these ads while they're in the middle of a political campaign,” Paul said at the hearing, per ABC News. “In New Jersey, $25 million was spent on ads that included somebody running for political office. Do ya think there might be a conflict of interest there?”
( SEE RESULTS: 2013 elections)
Christie and his family appeared in a series of ads earlier this year called “Stronger Than the Storm,” which used some of the federal emergency disaster funding from Hurricane Sandy to encourage people to visit the Jersey Shore. At the time, New Jersey Democrats criticized Christie for using federal funding to make ads that they argued were essentially free campaign messaging.
“That's a real problem. And that's why when people who are trying to do good and trying to use taxpayers' money wisely, they're offended to see our money spent on political ads,” Paul said. “That's just offensive. In New York, you actually have a rule. They're not allowed to do it. So New York did the same thing, which I still object, but at least they didn't put someone's face on the ads and their family, and it looks like a bio ad.”
The comments are the latest in a back-and-forth feud between the two potential 2016 hopefuls, which earlier this summer resulted in Paul calling Christie the “king of bacon” for his use of federal funds in his state and Christie responding that Paul was “juvenile.”
Earlier Wednesday, Paul responded to Christie's claims that D.C. is dysfunctional, saying things aren't as bad as the New Jersey governor makes them out to be.
“Is Washington dysfunctional? Yeah a lot of times. But I think what this shows are sometimes it can work,” he said at a press conference, referencing his working across the aisle on issues including combating sexual assault in the military.
Some in Syria's opposition have begun to call for military intervention, and the implementation of a 'no-fly zone' similar to that enforced by NATO in Libya [EPA]
The ebb and flow of the Arab revolutions is revealing political storms that could flood the Arab world with chaos. The people and their organised opposition groups mustn't fall prey to the dictators' ultimatums of "me or the flood".
It is a false choice. The Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions have shown a third way forward; one that no longer considers dictatorships as a fait accomplis, nor a spiralling descent into civil war, nor to become dependent on international protection.
This is not to say that all situations and challenges are one and the same, and revolutions must evolve like carbon copies of each other. Circumstances are, of course, different among Arab states.
But behind the specifics of each Arab society and polity there are also commonalities worth considering, without generalisation.
Three dimensions or general guidelines should, in particular, be examined.
Numbers speak louder than words
Some of the regimes, as in Libya or Syria, have had bloody records during the years, and their violent crackdown in recent months has pushed people to arm themselves or to ask for international intervention or protection.
But the militarisation of the Libyan revolution and the international intervention in Libya has proven costly. Before the intervention started, the estimated deaths stood at one to two thousand people.
By the time it ended several months later, tens of thousands were dead. Some put the figure at 20,000, others more than double that.
The huge difference in the estimates underlines just how bad and messy things have become.
Those Syrians asking for international intervention must consider the terrible cost paid by the Libyans.
Moreover, the oil-rich North African nation might be able to pay for reconstruction, but it won't recover the terrible "collateral damage" in human losses and injuries.
Syria, meanwhile, is not only poor, it's also a complicated society with growing ethnic tensions and deep societal polarisation. It's not clear how imposing a no-fly-zone in Syria could ease the regime's crackdown. The Syrian military is heavily deployed among the population centres and would be hard to hit without terrible cost to citizens.
Short of costly foreign military intervention with boots on the ground that would also cripple Syria's national security capabilities for decades to come, with dangerous regional and international ramifications, it's not clear how any foreign military intervention could help.
Furthermore, NATO, the only international military alliance capable of such operation as in Libya or the Balkans, has made clear they have no appetite for another mission. They also emphasised they wouldn't act in any way without a UN Security Council mandate.
In addition, Russia and China have already made clear their rejection of any such military scenario in Syria or a repeat of Libya.
Short history, shorter memory
People have every right to defend themselves - and I am in no position to ask people to suffer at the hands of their oppressors. However, those advocating the militarisation of the Arab revolutions as a strategy and asking for international intervention to support the growing insurgency have either lapsed or selective memory.
In the not so distant past, a generation of young officers between the ages of 26-36 took the reins of power and went on to rule for decades with iron fist - in Syria, Yemen, Libya and Algeria.
No domestic military answer succeeded in resolving any Arab or Middle Eastern problems in recent decades - except in terms of ridding people of colonialism. And even that has come with a very heavy price - as in the case of Algeria.
Certainly, the international corollary is also correct. No international military intervention/adventure in the region has succeeded in resolving central issues of governance, development and freedom either.
Western and other interference over the past century has not only failed to resolve any problem, foreign powers have mostly complicated the national and political situations and compounded the region's problems.
The seeds of the current ethnic and sectarian divisions facing the likes of Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine/Israel were planted by European colonialism in the hope of dividing and ruling the area.
Syrians asking for international intervention need to reflect calmly, not only upon NATO's intervention in Libya, but also over the intervention in Iraq - where hundreds of thousands have been killed, and where the sectarian tensions continue to cripple the nation, leaving it at the mercy of the US and Iran.
In short, the likes of Syria and Yemen cannot afford to be dragged into civil wars by dictators or into total dependency on Western/international protection.
For their own
It's quite ironic that Moscow and Beijing that have long claimed to speak on behalf of the people are now transparently siding with the autocracies, and those who long stood with dictators are now claiming to stand with the people.
At the heart of their disagreement lies a far more sinister calculus than peoples' rights.
BRICS powers such as China and Russia insist on the stability of an inter-state system that respects national sovereignties that secures their interests - regardless of what happens inside these states.
Meanwhile, western powers - speaking in the name of "the international community" - are advancing a more globalised international system that gives them greater access to independent nations on economic, security and humanitarian grounds.
The Arabs need to remember that regional and international powers have "interests" - not "friends" - in this region.
On their own
For their part, Egyptians have returned to the streets and public squares of their major cities in recent days, forcing the military to apologise for its policies, to appoint a new government with full authority and to promise to vacate its executive role after presidential elections by the middle of next year.
And even that has fallen short of peoples' demands - after tens have died in the protests at the hands of vengeful security forces. Yet the revolution has made important strides.
The week's balance sheet, like the year's in total, has been in favour of the revolution that continues to show a restless and vibrant public eager to open a new page in the history of their country.
As I wrote in February, the question for Egypt is not who replaces Mubarak - rather what replaces the Mubarak regime.
The generals' backing of the revolution against Mubarak and company might have quickened his downfall and eventual imprisonment, but it also delayed a serious change in the country's operating system.
This meant that change would be slow and short of the expectations of the people - who feel there hasn't been a sufficient enough political and institutional break with the past.
True, the revolution did help dissolve the former ruling national democratic party and put its leaders on trial, but the system that incubated the party and military remained intact.
But as the Egyptians and the Tunisians successfully pursue their revolutionary goals peacefully - albeit slowly breaking with the past, the complications stemming from militarising the revolutions in Libya, and potentially in Yemen and Syria, would not only slow down those revolutions, but would also backfire.
Attaining their goals through peaceful means is far more productive and constructive for the Arabs in both the short and long term than pursuing military solutions with outside military help, campaigns that, in all likelihood, would take even longer and be more destructive.

Olympics Labor Campaign Aims for Sweat-Free Games

Let the games begin. London has been buzzing with Olympic fever and its attendant political controversies, from the scandalized security apparatus surrounding the event to the sidelining of local working-class communities to make room for the sporting bonanza. But the biggest abuse of power takes place far from the podium: the exploitation of factory workers, who pour their sweat into the Olympic brand long before any sports star dons the logo on the field.
While there was a furor in Washington over Chinese-made Team USA uniforms, the debate over the use of offshored manufacturing labor to make Olympic apparel is just the tip of larger trend of abuse in multinational supply chains. Labor activists with the Playfair 2012 campaign have seized the Olympic arena as a platform to spotlight how labor gets cheated around the world. As we reported earlier this year, the group has for years pressured Olympic organizers to uphold fair labor standards in the sourcing of paraphernalia like sportswear and those adorable stuffed mascots. Those items may seem trivial, but the games are in large part a commercially-driven enterprise, and the corporations that source these knick-knacks in Indonesia, China and other parts of Asia are representative of an international supply chain rife with sweatshops, child labor and union-busting. (We also recently reported on a parallel campaign around Rio Tinto's ties to Olympic medals and dirty labor practices.)
A follow-up report issued by the campaign in May detailed harsh conditions in Olympic-supplier factories in China, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. The investigation highlighted abysmal wages, suppression of worker organizing, and poor housing:
Workers had legal benefits systematically denied to them by repeated use of short term contracts. Employers used these to avoid paying social insurance including pensions, sick leave and maternity benefits.
Workers were forced to perform overtime under threat of losing their jobs.
In all 10 factories there was no recognised union or credible workers' representatives, meaning workers had no voice on pay and conditions. In China workers were threatened with job losses for distributing leaflets that could ‘hamper employer-employee relationships; and in the Philippines all workers interviewed said that they were scared to join a union as they would lose their jobs.
One surveyed worker at a Philippines factory explained the lesson management drilled into new hires at orientation: “They said that union is not allowed in the company, as there is no need for a union anyway.”
Playfair has demanded that the suppliers of Olympic-brand goods adhere to standards for non-discrimination in employment, prohibition of child labor, and decent wages. Though these standards are notoriously difficult to enforce, the organizers and brand names of the 2012 games have committed, at least on paper, to helping protect workers and prevent abuses in their supply chains.
Playfair's July progress report noted that the London organizing committee did commit to some of the key principles the group proposed:
The publication of the names and locations of factories in China and the UK covering 72% of licensed goods for London 2012.
Making information about workplace rights, based on national laws and the ETI Code, available in Chinese and English, and establishing a hotline so that Chinese workers can complain if their rights are violated.
Providing training to some workers in Olympic supply chains to make them more aware of their rights.
A commitment to work with Playfair 2012, the organisers of Rio 2016 and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ensure that future Games benefit from the lessons learned.
Last year Playfair scored a breakthrough by compelling major Olympic sportswear suppliers Adidas, Nike, Puma, Pentland (Speedo), New Balance and Asics to sign on to a protocol to protect workers' rights to freedom of association in Indonesia. So far, though, the campaign has also reported on lackluster performance by multinational brands in adhering to their past promises to uphold workers rights and improve working conditions.
A follow-up investigation by Playfair into labor practices at Adidas, for instance, found that “Despite being committed to a living wage through sourcing agreements with the London Games Organisers LOCOG, [A]didas continues to refuse to implement the payment of a living wage to workers producing Olympic sportswear, or any [A]didas goods.”
But the Playfair protocol in Indonesia does seem to be edging toward positive change in some workplaces. According to the campaign, the list of principles, which builds on existing International Labour Organisation standards, aims to ensure direct accountability for multinationals, and is part of a broader process of engagement with civil society actors:
Indonesian unions KASBI, SPN, Garteks, TSK and GSBI have played a leading role in the protocol negotiations. These unions collectively represent more than half a million workers of whom 70% are women. The negotiation process was supported by a number of local and international NGOs including Jakarta Legal Aid Institute, the Play Fair Alliance and Oxfam.
The Olympic games are a fitting arena for a labor struggle that transcends borders. Transnational labor groups like the newly launched IndustriALL Union and the International Trades Union Confederation, as well as global non-governmental organizations, have been at the helm of the Playfair campaign. Ashling Seely, a representative of IndustriALL, told In These Times:
Trade unions are at the heart of the Play Fair campaign and have been since the campaign began in 2003. … Our core demands on respect for freedom of association and collective bargaining, for living wages to be paid, and for an end to precarious work relationships, are relevant in most countries, and the campaign is built on the principle of solidarity.
Seely added that future campaigns will target the construction and factory labor in the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympic games in Brazil.
While Playfair's pressure campaigns have helped bring labor into the Olympic spotlight, the long-term struggle lasts much longer than the summer sports season. The ultimate goal for the labor movement is to change the rules of the game of global trade, and unions are just getting warmed up.
Cold weather storms this time of year can be mild (lasting several hours), or severe (lasting several days, with strong winds and very low temperatures). Knowing how to prepare for these events is important for your safety and the safety of your family. Here are a few things you can do to be ready for inclement weather if you live in a cold climate like Michigan.
According to FEMA, there are three phases to coping with a cold weather disaster. These are Prepare, Survive, and Recover.
Preparing for a Cold Weather Emergency
In preparation for a storm or extreme cold, the first thing you can do is gather supplies. The following are some essential (and a couple non-essential) items you might want to stock up on before the next cold front hits.
First aid kit. A first aid kit is absolutely essential, especially if the roads are bad and emergency help cannot reach you. Have a first aid manual available, and consider taking a first aid certification course, such as the one offered by the American Red Cross.

The great thing about these devices is that you will be able to get emergency notifications and, if the power goes out, it will provide you with light and a way to charge your cell phone. It also doesn't hurt to have a couple of extra LED flashlights with 5-year batteries.

It also doesn't hurt to have a couple of extra LED flashlights with 5-year batteries. Water. Keep at least a 3 day supply of water, 1 gallon per person per day. A water filter or purification method can be substituted if you have a source of water nearby and a way to melt it if it's frozen.

Prepared food. MREs (Meals Ready to Eat) were originally developed for the military, but are now available in many varieties designed for civilian use. They come dehydrated in pouches—just add hot water. If you cannot boil water, you can also make them with cold water. Although this isn't particularly appealing, at least you won't go hungry!

Candles/Cans of Sterno fuel. – These provide light and enough heat to boil water or warm up some food. Also be sure to have a box of dry matches or a couple of lighters.
Fuel. If you have a fireplace, wood stove or pellet stove, make sure that you have plenty of fuel to burn. If the electricity goes out, this is a great way to stay warm.

if you have a pet. Adequate cold weather gear and bedding. We're from Michigan, so we should already have this covered!
We're from Michigan, so we should already have this covered! Salt or other some other product to melt ice. It's useful to have road salt in order to keep from slipping on your walkways or driveways when it's time to dig out.

Comfort Items
Craft beer. What better to accompany your MREs when the storm is raging outside!
What better to accompany your MREs when the storm is raging outside! Games and books. If the power goes out, you'll need something to do besides sleep.
It's best to supply yourself adequately so you will not have to drive. In addition to stocking up on essential items, you should develop a communications plan with your family, including those who do not live in your area. If you have a household generator, make sure it's in working order and ensure the batteries in your smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors are fresh. Finally, bring pets indoors to protect them from the storm.
During the Emergency
FEMA recommends that you stay inside during the storm and stay off the roads. Limit your outdoor exposure as much as you can. If you really do need to go outdoors, make sure you're properly clothed, layering and covering as much of your skin as possible.
In order to avoid freezing pipes, do not lower your thermostat at night during extreme cold snaps and keep your taps dripping. Although it may cost a little more to keep your home warmer, it's a lot less expensive than repairing frozen pipes and the water damage that can accompany them.
If the heat goes out, close off unused rooms and turn on all of your taps so that they drip. If you have a fireplace or wood burning stove, camp out in that room to stay warm. In addition, never heat your home with a grill, propane heater, camp stove, or your kitchen range. If you do so, you risk carbon monoxide poisoning.
After the Emergency
If your heat or electricity has gone out for an extended period of time, consider going to a friend's or relative's house (who has power), a hotel, or a community shelter. If the temperature is consistently well below freezing, move the contents of your refrigerator and freezer to a garage or unheated service porch to keep the food from going bad.
Use extra caution when shoveling snow. Push rather than lifting the snow, take frequent breaks (go inside and warm up), and make sure that you are properly clothed. Also, take careful note of symptoms of frostbite.
Stay Safe!
Keep these preparedness steps in mind when the next cold front hits. Doing so will help ensure you and your loved ones stay safe and comfortable, even when the weather takes a turn for the worse.

Rubio said on Twitter that the House GOP's proposed $600 increase to the child tax credit “doesn't achieve our & [President Trump's] goal of helping to work families.”
The House GOP tax plan released Thursday calls for increasing the child tax credit to $1,600 per child from $1,000.
Rubio and several other GOP lawmakers also met in June with Ivanka Trump, a senior White House adviser and the president's older daughter, about the child tax credit and paid family leave.
The House GOP tax plan would consolidate the current seven brackets to four, with the top tax rate staying at 39.6 percent. The other individual rates in the bill are 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent.
The standard deduction is nearly doubled, and the bill also creates a $300 credit for expenses related to care of parents and non-child dependents. The bill preserves the child and dependent care credit and the earned income tax credit.
Sony has confirmed (via GameIndustry.biz) they're shuttering the UK-based internal studio Guerrilla Cambridge.
The publisher said the need to shut the studio down is “regrettable,” as the decision came from a full review of all the current projects being worked on across PlayStation consoles. The assessed that “in order to deliver on our strategic objectives, it is necessary to make some changes to the European studios structure.”
The developer was primarily known for the classic MediEvil series on the original PlayStation, and most recently put out the ambitious PlayStation VR title RIGS: Mechanized Combat League. Founded back in 1997, the studio was acquired by Sony and later restructured as a subsidiary of Guerrilla Games.
Sony confirmed that no other studios will be affected, however all Cambridge employees will be laid off, with Sony attempting to reallocate them to other projects if possible. They've also pledged to help assist former employees find work in other local studios.
Here's a bit more of Sony's statement:
“Whilst we accept that this decision will mean that we risk losing high calibre staff, by focusing on other Studios with exciting new projects in development, (including continued work on PlayStation VR), we believe we will be in a stronger position going forward and able to offer the best possible content of the highest quality to our players.”
“This decision should not take anything away from the incredible games and services that Guerrilla Cambridge has delivered.”
HONG KONG — Hopes dimmed for an imminent pickup in China, the world's growth engine, as a batch of disappointing economic data released Thursday showed industrial production and retail sales falling well short of expectations in July.
Industrial output, a major measure of how healthy the Chinese manufacturing sector is, grew 9.2 percent from a year earlier, far below the 9.8 percent that analysts polled by Reuters had expected. The figure also marked a slowdown from the 9.5 percent seen in June.
Retail sales, which give an indication of domestic demand, grew 13.1 percent in July. Economists had expected the figure to remain at the 13.7 percent level recorded in June.
Finally, investment in fixed assets — items like equipment and property that are expected to be held for long periods of time and cannot easily be converted to cash — expanded 20.4 percent in the first seven months of the year, about the same as in the January-June period, frustrating hopes for a more marked pickup that could help lift the overall economy.

The Chinese economy has been stumbling for months, stung by weak overseas demand for its exports and by the lingering effect of Beijing's efforts last year to rein in inflation.
It's now been just about five years since Sufjan Stevens took orchestral indie pop to epic, expansive heights on his Illinois album, which placed in our top 20 of the past decade. Since then, Sufjan has worked on plenty of different projects, like Christmas records and the BQE orchestral work, but he still hasn't released a proper follow-up. And it was starting to look like he'd never release a new, full studio album. Talking to Paste last year, he said, "I no longer really have faith in the album anymore. I no longer have faith in the song."
But the National's Bryce Dessner, a friend of Sufjan, tells Exclaim! that Sufjan is at work on that elusive new album right now. According to Dessner, Stevens is recording the album at the National's Brooklyn studio.
Dessner says, "We've played on some of the tracks and been listening to some of the stuff as he's been working on it." He added, "It's going to be incredible. It's going to probably blow people's minds."
Dessner also says that the new work won't sound like the music Stevens has released in the past, and he offers the unsurprising tidbit that Sufjan is "very solitary in what he does".
Nothing solid yet, then, but the prospect of a Sufjan/National record should get us through some rainy days.

Welcome to Patch Chat, a Dev Corner thread we make to talk about our new patches every two weeks: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-73-notes I'm Aesah on Riot's Playtest Team, a group of Diamond+ players who play with the new champions, reworks, balance tweaks, items, and map updates before they are released. It's our job to the test the changes that our designers come up with and ensure that we're introducing positive changes to LoL in terms of both balance and fun. We'll be watching this thread to answer as many questions as we can. 7.3 is primarily focused on addressing champions that were too far out of line in pro play. We certainly consider how these changes affect the majority of our players too- This nerfs were warranted there as well, with many of these champs being near permaban status in normal and ranked drafts. The offenders include Camille, Ivern, Jayce, Kha'zix, Leblanc, Malzahat, Rengar, and Zyra. All of us on the Playtest Team are avid gamers so feel free to talk to us as fellow LoL players!

Many fighters and managers had high hopes for the World Series of Fighting when it first appeared on the mixed martial arts scene. In a UFC dominated market it offered another option for national exposure and a healthy purse. Those same fighters and managers are now expressing frustration with the promotion for a lack of communication with its athletes and for failing uphold their agreements.
Last month Jacob Volkmann took to a social network to tweet his displeasure with the WSOF. His comments were met with a quick response by WSOF matchmaker Ali Abdelaziz, who said: "I honestly can't believe this guy. We went out of our way to take care of Jacob Volkmann, and now he's going to talk trash about us? Unbelievable."
Speaking to Volkmann about the incident, he took issue with Abdelaziz's statement that they went out of their way to take care of him. Instead he says the cause behind the dispute was WSOF's failure to live up to the agreement they had with him.
"Before I signed with World Series, I asked Ali how long would I have to wait between fights. It was important to me, because I didn't want to be sitting around. He texted me 4 to 5 months. Promised me it would never be any longer than that. I saved the text. I got it right here on my phone."
"At the end of September it had been three months since my last fight so they owed me one and offered me Luiz Firmino. But they told me they could only pay me 6 and 6, even though my agreement said 9 and 9. They promised me that they'd get me on the January show and pay me 11 and 11 to make up for it if I did it. I wanted to fight and needed the money so I said yes."
"January comes around and I'm planning on having a fight. I'm getting ready but I don't hear anything. A week before the event I get a call telling me they're sorry but they can't get me one. I'm mad. I'm also broke. I'm out money from what I should have made for my last fight and now I'm not going to get 11 and 11. I need the money so Shawn [Lampman] felt sorry for me and said he'd give me $3,000 right away to help make up for it. I'm happy he did but it still didn't make up for what I should have got."
"And they still don't have a fight for me after that. So I ask them to let me take a fight outside [WSOF]. They agree, so I fight in April, and since I really need the money now I do something dumb and take another fight on three days notice against T.J. O'Brien and lose."
"Now they don't want to give me any fights because I lost outside of World Series of Fighting and I am 'damaged goods', even though I had to do it because they weren't getting me fights and paying my bills to begin with."
"I tweeted about it so I could warn other fighters. So after that they tell me I'm no longer with World Series of Fighting, and make a big deal about how they verbally released me back in February even though they didn't give me the written release until now."
Volkmann's is not the only such case. Earlier this year Josh Burkman also took to twitter to voice his dissatisfaction, which was met by a quick response by Abdelaziz, triggering an ugly back and forth.
Burkman's complaints were almost identical to Volkmann's:
"I've got a clause that keeps me active, meaning they have to give me a certain amount of fights in a certain period of time. Going into the [WSOF 9] card, we were coming right up on that deadline where they owed me another fight. I told Ali that I wanted to fight on the card, but he said the card was filling up and at budget."
"So, they put me on the card against Stinson but sent me a bout agreement that paid me less than what my contract with them said I am supposed to get paid."
With another event not scheduled until months later, Burkman reluctantly agreed to the new terms.
While both of these incidents became to the public's attention through twitter, they are not the only ones. John Gunderson has confirmed that he too got into a heated dispute with the WSOF when he was asked to take a smaller amount than what his contract called for in order to get a fight. (Gunderson also wanted it known that he and WSOF have since made amends and that he now gets along great with Ray Sefo and Ali Abdelaziz.)
Other fighters and managers, who wished to remain anonymous, have told us similar stories, of being told that they could only book them in a fight if they agreed to fight for less than what their contract stipulated.
As one industry insider explained it:
"It's something you see small, rinky-dink shows doing. Promise a guy the moon and then once he's signed tell him you don't have the space or money to pay him what you said you'd pay him. They know the fighters aren't going to fight them. None of them are rich enough to hire a lawyer and take it to court. They have bills to pay so they're going to swallow their pride and take what they offer. And the promoters know this."
"Ali and them can pretend they're bending over backward to help these guys out by saying, 'hey the fighters signed an agreement for the new amount so they must have been OK with it.' The truth is they're telling people one thing to get them to sign and then not delivering on their end of the deal."
This is not the only source of grievances with the promotion.
"I'm very appreciative of what's theyhaving done for Rousimar Palhares," says manager Alex Davis. "Of hiring Rousimar, of giving him a title shot. Very appreciative. The only thing I need for me to do my job correctly, which is good for them and Rousimar Palhares, is I need straight answers. That's all."
Unfortunately, according to several fighters and managers, straight answers are lacking. Our sources have expressed frustration with what is, according to them, an unreasonable lack of communication by WSOF. As examples they cited incidents where fighters were told they were booked for an event only to learn much later that they weren't appearing on that card, of bouts being announced without the fighter or manager being informed or agreeing to them, of promises of new contacts never materializing, and of long waits with no word of when they will eventually be given a match.
We contacted World Series of Fighting to request an interview with Ali Abdelaziz or another official from the promotion, so that we could ask them about the accounts that were relayed to us. They denied that request but emailed us a statement by President Ray Sefo.
World Series of Fighting has unfortunately at times not been able to get all of our athletes fights at the due in part to scheduling windows from NBC Sports. Also, on a few occasions when a fighter has been injured, we've been unable to find an opponent at the last minute, so the non-injured fighter - again unfortunately - must wait. All promotions have these issues. As far as fighters agreeing to fight for less money, when we have a budget - as all companies must have - and we tell a fighter they are not scheduled on a card and must wait until a future event as the card is full and budget is met, certain fighters have agreed and asked to fight anyway, even if it's for less money, and we have accommodated these requests. For this to happen, a fighter must sign an amendment to his agreement. Fighters always have the option to wait, or if World Series of Fighting has not given a fighter a fight in the time specified in their agreement, then the fighter may cancel the agreement and go compete for another promotion.
The experience has proved so frustrating for Jacob Volkmann that he told us he has decided to retire, having determined that it is impossible to have a career within mixed martial arts.
Josh Burkman is also ready to move on. "I have three fights left in the World Series of Fighting and my goal is when I'm done I'm not resigning, I'm leaving and going to the UFC. World Series of Fighting is just a job now"

When news broke that Lenovo installed third party software to serve ads from a company called Superfish on many of its laptops, the cybersecurity world had a meltdown, and for good reason: the Superfish package leaves users completely vulnerable to having their communications intercepted, even on sites with encrypted connections.
According to a statement released by Lenovo today, the Superfish software has been disabled since January, and the company will no longer ship machines with the software pre-loaded. In a post on Lenovo's forums on January 23rd, Lenovo representatives stated they were awaiting a software fix from Superfish.
However, security researchers are still finding evidence of Superfish on some users' computers.
Security researchers from CloudFlare built a site called Badfish that Lenovo owners can use to easily test whether their machines are affected or not. Visit Badfish here. If your browser asks you to trust the site's certificate, you're all good. If you see a green "YES" instead, it means Superfish is intercepting the connection.
According to Badfish's creator, Cloudflare security researcher Fillipo Valsorda, the site caught a stunning number of Superfish infections just today. "In the last 30 minutes, 269 out of 3380 (8%) test visitors resulted positive for Superfish," he tweeted today. According to a report by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, also released today, their Decentralized SSL Observatory has detected 44,000 Superfish certificates.
The software from Superfish is an adware package that injects ads into web pages users visit by breaking secure HTTPS connections—the protocol for transferring encrypted data between computers and websites. Superfish installs a HTTPS certificate on the user's laptop and intercepts connections in order to present itself as the site's real certificate, an important part of the "handshake" between the machine and website that ensures both parties are who they say they are so an encrypted session can begin.

This essentially means the user's communications are open to interception on every site they visit. Even worse, the encryption key used for Superfish's certificate is the same on every machine, and it was just cracked by Errata Security CEO Rob Graham—meaning any hacker can launch attacks on users without them knowing.
In other words, if you have Superfish on your Lenovo laptop, you're a dead duck in still water for hackers hunting for vulnerable users. "If this software or any of its control infrastructure is compromised, an attacker would have complete and unrestricted access to affected customers' banking sites, personal data and private messages," Marc Rogers, CloudFlare researcher and head of security for DEFCON hacker conference, wrote in a blog post.
If you own a Lenovo laptop, it might not be a bad idea to check Badfish to see if your machine has dangerous adware installed before an attacker gains access to your information.​
Today, we filed our brief with the Supreme Court in our lawsuit challenging the FISA Amendments Act, the 2008 law that ratified and expanded the National Security Agency's warrantless wiretapping program. (You can read our brief here.)
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act – FISA – is a post-Watergate statute that was meant to rein in and regulate domestic surveillance undertaken in the name of national security. In 2008, Congress amended the statute, giving the National Security Agency unprecedented power to conduct dragnet surveillance of Americans' international communications. The ACLU immediately challenged the law, but the government has tried to keep our case out of court.
Our clients are a coalition of attorneys and human rights, labor, legal and media organizations whose work requires them to engage in sensitive and sometimes privileged telephone and e-mail communications with people located outside the U.S. The government argues they lack standing to challenge the law because they can't prove that their communications have been monitored under it. But, as we argue in our brief:
The government's insistence that plaintiffs cannot establish standing without proving the certainty of surveillance is at bottom not a standing argument but a bid for a kind of immunity. This is because its proposed standard is one that neither plaintiffs nor anyone else will ever be able to meet—not because the surveillance they fear will never take place but because they will be unaware of it when it does... The government theory of standing would render real injuries nonjusticiable and insulate the government's surveillance activities from meaningful judicial review.
Last year a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the government's argument, and late last year the full Second Circuit refused the government's request to reconsider that ruling. But instead of allowing the case to be heard on the merits, the Obama administration asked the Supreme Court to review the case. Our brief urges the Court to affirm the appeals court's decision. We write:
More than forty years ago, when surveillance technology was comparatively primitive, this Court recognized that “few threats to liberty exist which are greater than that posed by the use of eavesdropping devices” ... and it cautioned that the threat to core democratic rights was especially pronounced where surveillance authority was exercised in the service of national security.... To accept the government's theory of standing would be to accept that the courts are powerless to address the threat presented by surveillance authorities exercised in secret, and powerless to protect Americans' most fundamental rights against the encroachment of increasingly sophisticated and intrusive forms of government power.
Next week, a number of other organizations plan to file friend-of-the-court briefs in support of our lawsuit. Oral argument before the high court will be on October 29.
For more background on the battle over warrantless wiretapping, read this blog post. And, for more information on just how expansive the warrantless wiretapping spying program is, watch this video featuring NSA whistleblower William Binney.
Coincidentally, the 2008 amendments are scheduled to expire at the end of December, and we are calling on Congress to fix FISA by prohibiting dragnet surveillance, mandating more transparency about the government's surveillance activities, and strengthening safeguards for privacy – join us in calling on your member of Congress to Fix FISA.

Kealey is pleased the new regulations specifically allows vapour-products shops to be the only places where customers can sample vaping products. The association is working on a curriculum to certify and accredit those who make and those who sell vaping products.
The vaping industry has no problems having sales to minors banned or having the use of its products outlawed in all the public places where smoking tobacco is banned, he said.
"Manitoba is the first government to get it right," Marc Kealey, lead public affairs counsel for the Canadian Vaping Association, said from Mississauga. "We worked closely with Manitoba Health."
Health Minister Kelvin Goertzen got big praise Wednesday from the vaping industry he had just regulated even more strictly.

Kealey is pleased the new regulations specifically allows vapour-products shops to be the only places where customers can sample vaping products. The association is working on a curriculum to certify and accredit those who make and those who sell vaping products.
In Winnipeg, Mike knows vaping, and Mike is cool with the province's new ban on selling to minors and on vaping anywhere tobacco smoking is banned.
"I think it's fair," Mike said Wednesday. He manages the Flamingo Vape Shop on Main Street, but declined to give his last name.
"That's all that passed?" he asked. "We already don't sell to minors. We ID anyone we think is under 25."
As for vaping in places such as a mall: "I find that rude, just because of common courtesy. No one wants to inhale."
Changes to the Non-Smokers Health Protection Amendment Act (E-Cigarettes) will take effect Oct. 1, including the banning the sale of vaping products to minors, Goertzen said.
"Electronic cigarettes have been growing in popularity over the past number of years, particularly with youth and young adults, but there is little conclusive evidence about the potential harm of long-term e-cigarette use," said Goertzen.
The province will also place restrictions on the display, advertising and promotion of e-cigarettes and vapour products, Goertzen said.
Adults can still sample products within a vaping shop.
The new legislation is a good start, but not a complete deterrent or solution to vaping's unknown health problems, said Neil Johnston, director of health initiatives and interim CEO and president of the Manitoba Lung Association.
"As a lung association, we hope vaping won't happen, but it's thing we have to live with. Less harmful doesn't mean non-harmful," Johnston said.
Flavoured vapour is intended to help people stop smoking, but some brands and products may contain nicotine, and people can concoct whatever mixture they wish at home, including illegal drugs, Johnston said.
Federal studies show 13 per cent of people 15 to 18 have tried it, yet there's little research into the long-term effects, he said.
"It normalizes smoking behaviour. It's definitely a growing phenomenon," Johnston said. "You need long-term studies."
Johnston expects pushback from big tobacco, which he said is moving into vaping to make up lost revenue from the reduction in smoking.

Not so, said Kealey: "We are in no way, shape or form associated with big tobacco."
NDP health critic Matt Wiebe pointed out that the legislation was introduced when his party was still in power.
"The legislation went through extensive committee hearings and consultations with stakeholders," he said.
Mike conceded fears about the long-term health impact of vaping is a fair point.
"Vaping's only been around seven or eight years. The majority of people who come in to vape, 80 to 90 per cent, they're trying to quit smoking," he said.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN STATEMENT ON FOX NEWS DEBATE
(New York, NY) January 26th, 2016 - As someone who wrote one of the best-selling business books of all time, The Art of the Deal, who has built an incredible company, including some of the most valuable and iconic assets in the world, and as someone who has a personal net worth of many billions of dollars, Mr. Trump knows a bad deal when he sees one. FOX News is making tens of millions of dollars on debates, and setting ratings records (the highest in history), where as in previous years they were low-rated afterthoughts.
Unlike the very stupid, highly incompetent people running our country into the ground, Mr. Trump knows when to walk away. Roger Ailes and FOX News think they can toy with him, but Mr. Trump doesn't play games. There have already been six debates, and according to all online debate polls including Drudge, Slate, Time Magazine, and many others, Mr. Trump has won all of them, in particular the last one. Whereas he has always been a job creator and not a debater, he nevertheless truly enjoys the debating process - and it has been very good for him, both in polls and popularity.
He will not be participating in the FOX News debate and will instead host an event in Iowa to raise money for the Veterans and Wounded Warriors, who have been treated so horribly by our all talk, no action politicians. Like running for office as an extremely successful person, this takes guts and it is the kind of mentality our country needs in order to Make America Great Again.
So you went to design school. You have a badass portfolio filled with projects that you got an "A" on. You know the software like the back of your hand. You even have recommendations from your professors.
Now what?
I see this question asked on a daily basis by students who have recently, or are about to — graduate from design school. I'd like to share with you some useful advice that I have either learned by way of mentors and through my own experiences.
Since everyone carves their own career path, the advice here may not apply to you in particular. It can be applied to self-taught designers as well as new graduates, or even experienced designers. My hope is that even one piece of advice below will help you have a more successful start to your career in the design industry.
Work with people who are better than you
You may have heard this one before, and for good reason. When applying for a position you should make an effort to land at a company in which you will be working with other designers that are more experienced and more skilled than yourself. When people say, "Don't be the best in the room", you should take it literally. In doing so, you will be given an opportunity to learn from your fellow co-workers things that design school most likely never taught you.
When surrounding yourself with experienced and skilled designers you should become a sponge. Soak up every single ounce of knowledge that you can. You should be ready and willing to help out in any way possible. Ask a lot of questions, then ask some more. You can even go as far as considering your co-workers as college professors that you don't have to pay for — in fact, you are getting paid while learning. How awesome is that?
Landing a job where you will be surrounded by talented designers may require some research on your part but it can most definitely supercharge your career growth.
Do personal project
Ask nearly any successful designer how they got where they are today and chances are the first thing they will tell you is by spending countless hours working on personal projects. The term "personal project" can mean several things — it could mean that you take on an unsolicited redesign of your favorite iOS app. It could mean that you design your own typeface. It could mean that you develop your own scripts for After Effects. It could also mean that you do a collaboration with a peer.
When I first started designing professionally, I was doing website and banner ads for local small businesses. While that type of work paid the bills, the work was never "fun" nor "cool”. At the time, it may have been considered "good work" by my employers but it was never what I had wanted to do deep down inside. I had always wanted to do work that I enjoyed — so I made a strong effort to do personal projects when I wasn't working.
This came in the form of playing "Photoshop Tennis" — a game that was popular in the early 2000's. I'd do 3-4 matches a week in which I'd compete against my peers on design forums. Although at the time I never really looked at it this way, these were essentially personal projects. Looking back, I realize how much those Photoshop Tennis matches helped me grow as a designer by learning and experimenting.
A prime example of how personal projects can benefit your career is shown by prolific Illustrator and Designer, James White of Signalnoise Studios. James has experienced success thanks to his awesome pop-culture illustrations and movie posters, almost all of them, you guessed it — personal projects. These personal projects allowed James to discover, develop and refine his personal design style which ultimately led to him landing projects for huge clients such as Toyota, Nike, Wired, MTV and Google.
Another well known advocate of personal projects is letterer Jessica Hische, who's personal project, The Daily Drop Cap, allowed her to explore new techniques and styles in her lettering. Probably one of the most impressive examples of designers who practice personal projects is Beeple. By doing his "Everydays" for the past 2800+ consecutive days, he has clearly honed his skills in Cinema 4D to the point that he has become one of the most prolific 3D Artists today.
Personal projects allow you to not only develop a your own style, but also allow you to learn new techniques through experimentation, bolster your portfolio with work in an area that interests you and practice and improve existing skills, all at your own pace and with no fear of failure.
By doing personal projects on a regular basis, I can promise you — you will see positive results in one form or another.

Do not get taken advantage of
The fact that I have to write this saddens me greatly, but there are horrible people out there, and chances are — you will meet them and as sure as the sun rises in the morning, they will do their best to take advantage of you as an employee by underpaying you. Don't take it personally. It's business after all, but as a recent graduate you should do everything in your power not to be taken advantage of.
I've met designers who were being paid less than a cashier at Target makes. Do not let yourself be lowballed just because you need a job to pay off those massive student loans. Do not accept a job where you are expected to work nights and weekends without any form of compensation. Do not work for a company that refuses to give their employees even the most basic of benefits — it all adds up.
Yes, you do need to pay those loans but at the same time, with your first job out of design school, you are laying a foundation for the rest of your career. By accepting a job that pays you less than entry-level salary, you are setting yourself up for a future of being behind. Sure, you can catch up by working hard, impressing your boss and getting a raise to put you closer to what you're worth, but by doing so you are simply selling yourself short.
You can avoid this by doing your research and knowing what you are worth. There are several salary websites out there such as Glassdoor.com in which you can look up your region, field and experience level to get a good idea of what you should be getting paid. AIGA and Coroflot.com also conduct yearly salary surveys that are worth taking a look at. If you can't find the information you seek online — ask someone who is already established in the field. Just because you are inexperienced, it does not mean you should be taken advantage of.

Never get tired
A few years ago I attended a lecture at the Wolfenstein Museum with Steven Heller and his wife Louise Fili. Mr. Heller answered questions from the audience at the end of his lecture. One question stuck out in particular — "What is the one thing you can suggest for a young designer to be successful?" Mr. Heller's response really stuck with me. He simply said; "Never get tired." I immediately knew that he didn't mean to not get tired in the sense that you will probably be working your ass off thanks to the long hours, tight deadlines and all of the other wonderful joys of you will experience as a designer but rather that you should never get tired of improving yourself as a designer.
You may get tired of putting in 110% effort in your work. You may get tired of reading design books. You may get tired of doing tutorials and teaching yourself new techniques. I assure you, I get tired all the time. There are stretches of time where part of me just wants to just go on cruise control and collect a paycheck — but thanks to Mr. Heller, I realized that it is the ability to push past being tired that helps to separate an average designer from a good one.
Do not take on any work without a signed contract
Regardless of where you are at in your career, it is of the upmost importance that you do not take on any work without a signed contract in place. All too often designers get burnt by clients for non-payment. Having a contract protects you and your client by setting expectations and in a sense, rules for the project. In your contract you should include a form of payment agreement. You can also include other agreements such as cancellation fees, payment schedule, transfer of rights, reproduction and display of work as well as project timelines.
By having a signed contract, this provides you with a sort of legal safety net. Should you ever come across a deadbeat client that refuses to pay you — you now have the proof needed for your claim to stand up in the case of a lawsuit.
It should also be noted that if you intend on bringing in a lot of freelance work it may be of value for you to hire a lawyer to handle your contract needs. Whether you handle your contracts yourself or hire a lawyer to draft up your contracts, it is an often overlooked yet incredibly crucial step to protecting yourself as a designer.
Related: You can download a free contract from Ash Thorp's website that you can customize to suit your needs. He also speaks with guests on his podcast, The Collective Podcast at length about protecting yourself with a contract.
Sign up for Behance, Dribbble, Coroflot and other gallery sites
When I first started in the industry, gallery sites like Behance did not exist. At most, there were forums. Nowadays, having a profile on sites like Behance, Dribbble and Coroflot among many others is necessary.
I urge you to upload your best work and use these communities to promote yourself by linking up with other designers and sharing your work. You can also see passive results from having a profile on these sites since many recruiters and agencies search for talent here. I have received a handful of job opportunities from Dribbble (while paying for the "Pro" account, which allows you to be listed as a designer for hire), Behance and Coroflot.
Connecting with other designers on these sites is another benefit of having a profile, so long as you contribute to the community in a meaningful manner. This means that you should not spam a link to your work in the comments of other member's work. It means you should leave meaningful and helpful comments and build relationships with other members naturally.
Most of these gallery sites are free to use and are a surefire way to increase your exposure and network with other designers.
I hope that you have found the advice I've given to be helpful. Going out into the workforce can be a scary thing but we've all gone through it. Again, the advice I've given may not be for everyone, in fact some people may even disagree with what I've said. Over the course of your career, you will probably get advice from multitudes of different people. It is up to you to take bits and pieces of that advice and combine it to create your own path to success.
If you are an experienced designer and have advice to give recent graduates and current students for that matter — please post in the comments below. I would love to hear from you.
Homeless Families Wait Longer For Shelter Under Seattle's System
Enlarge this image toggle caption John Ryan/KUOW John Ryan/KUOW
If you have an emergency, you dial 911. If you find yourself in need of emergency food or shelter, you can dial 211 — but help might not come very soon.
On a busy morning at Seattle's Crisis Clinic, specially trained operators such as Alex Williams, handle a flood of 211 calls.
"We do try to stress that, unfortunately, because the need is so great, it isn't likely to be immediate, and it could be months, even, before they are placed in a shelter," Williams says. "It can be frustrating and difficult to deliver that message."
The hotline connects callers to all sorts of services. In the Seattle area, it's also the front door for a program called the Family Housing Connection.
Under that program, homeless families typically wait more than six months before they land a spot in some kind of low-income housing.
Nationwide, the need for shelter dwarfs what governments and charities have been able to provide for the homeless.
That gap is worsened in the Seattle area by the bottleneck of the Family Housing Connection, located in King County.
Capricha Alfred is stuck in that bottleneck.
"I'm staying in a night shelter," she says. "Been there since July."
I met Alfred and some other homeless moms at a day shelter called Mary's Place.
Before getting into a shelter, Alfred and her son had spent about nine months couch surfing and staying in her car.
"I was also going to school and trying to at least keep life somewhat normal," she says.
The Family Housing Connection is a centerpiece of King County's plan to end homelessness. It's a centralized way for homeless families like Alfred's to get help.
They just make a phone call to 211, and the Family Housing Connection takes over from there.

"They put you in a database, and they say, 'Well, if someone is looking for you or someone like you, then we'll call you,' " Alfred says. "And it's like, 'OK, so what do I do 'til then?' The concept was probably, you know, meant well, but it doesn't work."
Homeless families often have what are called "barriers" to getting housing, which could be anything from a criminal record to poor mental health. And each shelter or housing program has its own criteria for deciding who qualifies to live there.
Jennifer Cicardini and her kids have been homeless since June. She says she's been turned down for housing because she lost her kids' social security cards after they all lost their home. She's trying to replace the cards.
"I'm on a lot of different waitlists throughout Washington," Cicardini says. "Some of those waitlists are years long, I know that."
"It's a struggle, but there is places and resources out there that are willing to help. You've just got to kind of go out there and find it."
Most Seattle area shelters don't let families just show up or call to get in that night, even if the shelter has empty beds. That's unlike emergency shelters for single people.
Family shelters in King County have up to 20 percent of their apartment-like units empty each night, and not for lack of demand.
"We have 500 homeless families on the streets, and we have vacant shelter beds," says Sharon Lee, head of Seattle's Low Income Housing Institute. "You're waiting, waiting, waiting. So how is this an emergency crisis response to homelessness?"
Managers of family shelters say some vacancies are inevitable. But they say the Family Housing Connection makes the problem worse.
The officials who created the program say the long wait for shelter predates their 3-year-old system.
But they acknowledge it's not working well, and they're trying to fix it.
King County was one of the first communities to create a central portal for homeless services. Now, they're a federal requirement. Other communities are struggling to set up or reboot their programs.
The Obama administration expects to issue new regulations this summer on how to serve the homeless more effectively.
More people were put to death in countries around the world last year than in any other year during the past quarter-century, Amnesty International said Tuesday.
The report said at least 1,634 people were executed in 2015, a rise of 54 percent from the year before and the highest number the human rights watchdog has recorded since 1989.
Executions were carried out in 25 countries, but just three – Iran, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan -- accounted for 90 percent of all recorded executions.
Pakistan ends moratorium
In Pakistan, the December 2014 Taliban attack on a school in Peshawar that killed 141 people led the government to end its moratorium on executions.
"Initially the moratorium was meant to be lifted only for terrorism-related crimes," said Chiara Sangiorgio, death penalty researcher at Amnesty International. "But very soon, we saw persons being sent to the gallows for murder or other ordinary crimes, often on the basis of trials that leave a lot of doubts about the safety of the conviction.”
Amnesty said at least 158 people were executed in Saudi Arabia, a predominantly Sunni country. Among those executed was Shi'ite cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr.
Riyadh said it uses the death penalty against terrorists, but Amnesty claims it is often used against political dissidents.
Drug offenses
In Iran, many executions were carried out for drug-related offenses.
“A significant proportion of the 977 executions that we recorded for Iran were carried out for drug-related offenses – even if international law clearly states that the use of the death penalty should be restricted to intentional killing," Sangiorgio said.
Iran is one of the last countries to execute child offenders, in violation of international law. Last year, it executed at least four people who were under 18 at the time of their crimes, the report said.
However, the true number of people executed globally is likely much higher, because China is excluded from Amnesty's data, she added.
“This figure does not include the thousands of people that we believe were executed in China last year, where the use of the death penalty and the figures in particular in relation to the use of the death penalty remain classified as a state secret," she said.
Belarus, the only European country to use the death penalty, and Vietnam also do not provide data.
US executions
The U.S., the only country in the Americas to use capital punishment, was fifth on the Amnesty list of the most executions carried out in 2015.
There were 28 executions in six U.S. states – the southern state of Texas accounted for almost half the total.
America "recorded the lowest number of executions since 1991. And also the lowest number of sentences imposed since the death penalty was reintroduced in the United States in 1977," Sangiorgio said.
Amnesty Secretary General Salil Shetty said, "Thankfully, countries that execute belong to a small and increasingly isolated minority."
For the first time, a majority of the world's countries -- 102 -- have now fully abolished the death penalty. Four countries adopted the ban in 2015: Fiji, Madagascar, the Republic of Congo and Suriname.
Crampton rockets to 3.69 top qualifying pass
Australia's Richie Crampton has top qualified for the Amalie Motor Oil NHRA Gatornationals at Florida's Gainesville Raceway with a 3.698 second run.
The pass was the fifth quickest in history and the first 3.6 second 1000 feet time outside of Brainerd.
“We struggled a bit yesterday, and we were looking forward to the overcast conditions today because we all know what (crew chief) Aaron Brooks could do when the weather was like that, with a cool track temperature,” said Crampton. “To do what we did in the first qualifying session today and then run a 3.6 was very cool. Hats off to Aaron Brooks and my Lucas Oil guys.”
Crampton said he had a suspicion Brooks was going to throw the kitchen sink at the track.
“I knew we were going to try and do it. We all know what Aaron is like. When the weather is good he is not going to let an opportunity to roll the dice slide by him.
“I knew that he would be trying and that the car would be up to it, I just didn't know if the track would hold it.
“I was confident but I wasn't sure we were going to make it all the way down there. By half track I knew we were on a heck of a good run. It put me back in the seat so hard and I haven't made runs like that for quite some time so it got my attention pretty good.”
The South Australian native said he could feel the tightness in the track from the driver's seat.
“During the burnout you can feel the rear tyres hook up at the end of the burnout. Sometimes with as little stall in the clutches we use it can be hard to back up (reverse) as good as the race tracks can be.
“I nearly threw it away, it carried the front end so far off the starting line and drove me a little bit to the right, I had my hands full trying to get it back into the groove and keep it stuck.
“There's probably 2000 ways to get it wrong and only a couple of ways to get it right.”

Friday saw the Big 12 with their 10 members decide that in 2017, they will re-start their championship game.
That means 9 of the 10 FBS leagues now will have a conference championship game (CCG). The only holdout is the Sun Belt.
But don't think a Sun Belt CCG is coming anytime soon. After deciding to not renew New Mexico State and Idaho and stick at 10 football-playing members in 2018, Sun Belt commish Karl Benson went around saying that there likely won't be a championship game until 2018.
This has been going on since 2013.
When the Sun Belt added Georgia Southern and Appalachian State as full members and Idaho and New Mexico State as football-only members in March 2013 to begin play in summer 2014, the league had 12 members. The purpose of the latter two was to get a CCG starting in 2014.
Days later, Western Kentucky was added to Conference USA, putting the Sun Belt back at 11 members in summer 2014 and unable to hold a CCG.
The Sun Belt, instead of just adding another FCS move-up, waited. With James Madison not interested, the league decided upon Coastal Carolina in late August 2015 to begin Sun Belt football play in 2017. The CCG was back on.
In January, the NCAA voted to deregulate CCG's. As long as a conference either 1) played a complete round-robin schedule or 2) had two equal divisions playing round-robin among themselves, they could have a CCG.
While it was too late for the 2016 season, with Coastal making 12 members for 2017 and then 10 members beyond that, it seemed like it was time.
So why the holdup?
It seems that the league members want to keep the schedule relatively simple for 2017, instead of blowing it up for Coastal, then blowing it up again when Idaho and NMSU exit.
It's no secret that there's some Sun Belt leaders against a CCG. Terry Mohajir, AD of Arkansas State, is against the idea, saying it could cost a Sun Belt team a New Year's Six Access Bowl spot if they lose in a CCG.
But let's be real. A Sun Belt team isn't going to get an Access Bowl spot without taking the CCG plunge.
That 13th game represents a risk, but also a chance at a great reward. It'll get the league notoriety on a weekend where there's going to be only nine other FBS games, all championship games.
An 11-1 Sun Belt Champion team is always going to be disadvantaged when going up against a 12-1 American Athletic or Mountain West Champion. The risk of having a team go 11-2 or 12-1 and lose a CCG is worth having a team potentially go 12-1 or 13-0 and get the Sun Belt that Access Bowl spot and the jackpot.
The Sun Belt was last in the 2015 Group of 5 rankings. It's not like a CCG is gonna have the league finish any lower.
The Sun Belt needs to keep up with the joneses. It's time to add a Sun Belt Conference Championship Game. In 2018, put App State, Coastal Carolina, Georgia State, Georgia Southern and Troy in the East Division, then put South Alabama, UL-Lafayette, UL-Monroe, Arkansas State and Texas Statein the West Division. For 2017, have Troy vs South Alabama be a protected cross-division game and get going.
Without a CCG, that Access Bowl spot will never become a reality.
Every year on International Women's Day we are reminded that we still live in a world where most women are left behind. This is especially true for lesbian and bisexual women as well as trans and intersex people (LBTI people) who face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination daily.
Patriarchy, misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia are all intricately linked, oppressing and marginalizing LBTI people, resulting in exclusion and violence in the domestic and public sphere. Immense social pressure to conform to gender roles forces many into hiding and silence, invisibilizing their experiences of subjugation and discrimination.
OutRight's human rights documentation reports from Iran to Indonesia show that LBTI people face situations of sexual abuse and harassment and abuse by family members who refuse to accept their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can often lead to forced marriages, and domestic violence by spouses and other family members alike. Because of social stigmatization and the invisibilization, domestic and family violence often goes unreported and is severely under researched. Punitive laws, such as those that exclude marital rape from being considered a crime, laws that criminalize same-sex relations and lack of gender identity recognition laws, exacerbate the situation and add to impunity for individuals perpetrating violence against this community..
But as challenging as existing social norms and legislative environments are, those of us who fight for women's rights and LGBTI rights - all human rights - know that change is possible. In February, OutRight conducted a training with 34 government officials in Quezon City, Philippines on how to address domestic violence and family violence against LBT women.
After attending OutRight's training, a local gender and development officer contacted OutRight's Philippines- based trainer to tell her that she was assisting a 13-year old trans girl who had been beaten by her father as he did not accept that she is transgender. The officer met the trans girl in the street with bruises and welts all over her body. The officer said that thanks to the training, she felt equipped to deal with the situation, in a way that she wouldn't have before. She said the stereotyping and bias that she had been socialized into had been replaced by understanding of sexual orientation and gender identity. The officer has since issued a district protection order against the father and the girl are now living with her grandparents who are accepting of her gender identity.
More often than not stories of abuse, humiliation, exclusion, and violence of trans and intersex people and lesbian and bisexual women do not end well. When we have leaders who incite fear instead of inclusion, who choose discrimination, racism, and xenophobia instead of acceptance and equality, who block funding for sexual reproductive health services to women in need, who are anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, and anti-Muslim, and who threaten the very fabric of international law and state relations, we must stand up for our rights and for human rights for all.
To combat this we must truly stand up to ensure that no one continues to face persecution and violence at any level. In order to achieve a reality where everyone is included and all people have equal rights, we need to hold government leaders to account, we need laws that protect instead of penalize, we need to stand against sexist, racist, Islamophobic, and xenophobic policies, and demand justice for all who have been unduly harmed by such actions.
Today, I ask that you help to make visible to struggles of LBTI people, to bridge the gap between exclusion and being accounted for. I ask that you make space to talk about LBTI inclusion with a stranger, a friend, or a family member. I ask that you go to an event to learn more about the issues impacting our communities. Finally, I ask that you never let hateful and divisive rhetoric and action trump common humanity or the universality of all human rights and all human beings.
In the hot lobbying firefight going on at the moment over the government's systematic stifling of international online shopping by Canadians, one important voice is absent: consumers.
This is not terribly unusual. Farmers seldom ask the cow for permission to milk it.
But Canadian consumers seem largely unaware that a significant matter of their economic self-interest is being decided by others, quietly and behind closed doors.
In the Canadian order of things, access to consumers is controlled by government, which grants pretty much exclusive privileges to Canada's business sector, in return for guarantees of stability and an unshaken status quo.
That is especially so with e-commerce, at least where the massive American and European marketplaces are concerned. So strictly is international online shopping controlled, and penalized, that Canadians seem to have largely given up trying.
If a Canadian buys something worth more than $20 Cdn from a U.S. website, a federal customs agent will intercept it, open it, delay it, add federal and provincial sales taxes, and, depending on the origin of the merchandise, perhaps pile on some duty charges. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) Once Canada Customs tacks on protectionist duties and sales taxes and customs brokers add their fees, the package often becomes so expensive as to render the purchase pointless, which of course is the point.
Further, the Canadian threshold for taxing and applying duty to imports, known as de minimis, is a mere $20, the lowest in the developed world (the Americans don't tax or apply duty to any package worth less than $800 US, more than 40 times the Canadian limit).
This pax canadiana, designed mainly for the benefit of Canadian retailers and, they would argue, their employees, has been around forever, but a loose coalition of Americans and Canadians has for years been demanding that Canada open its online consumer market.
The group includes small and large Canadian businesses that buy and sell mostly with Americans, courier companies, big online retailers, resellers like Amazon and eBay, and even powerful American politicians.
eBay Canada has been lobbying the federal government to raise its $20 threshold for charging Canadians cross-border duties and taxes on goods purchased online from the U.S. (REUTERS) "Canada's low de minimis threshold represents an unnecessary trade barrier between our two countries," wrote 12 U.S. senators in a letter to then-Canadian ambassador Gary Doer last year.
Now, the coalition believes it is close to success, perhaps as early as this autumn's budget update, but believes the key is galvanizing Canadian consumers.
"Either we start behaving like a trading bloc or we don't," says Maryscott Greenwood of the Canadian-American Business Council, which recently put up an online petition, sponsored by Liberal MP Sonia Sidhu (who has an Amazon facility in her Ontario riding), demanding that Canada "dump the duties and taxes."
The council says it has so far collected more than 1,000 signatures from Canadians, but lobbyists like Greenwood also know that Canadian consumers, unlike Americans, are relatively quiescent, and many seem to have accepted that being Canadian means paying more taxes and higher prices for just about everything.
Bruce Cran, president of the Consumers' Association of Canada, says his group simply cannot afford a seat at the Ottawa table, but is delighted to lay out the CAC position: it wants the Canadian de minimis threshold raised to at least $800, which is the American level, and which is also the amount of merchandise a Canadian can physically bring back across the border after 48 hours in the U.S.
In the past, says Cran, CAC had the ear of Stephen Harper's finance minister, Jim Flaherty, even though the Conservatives ultimately did nothing about the de minimis threshold. (A spokesman for interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose could not articulate the party's current position on the issue.)
Stepping gingerly
Nowadays, Cran says, his group is ignored, and business groups are allowed to speak for consumers.
"How does that make sense?"
International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press) That's not to say there aren't free traders in cabinet. International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland, for one, is seen as supportive of a sharp increase in the Canadian import threshold.
But the government, knowing the Retail Council of Canada's resolute opposition to any change in the status quo, and the fact that the RCC represents businesses employing 1.9 million workers, is stepping gingerly.
The RCC complains that unlike American retailers, Canadian merchants must collect sales taxes for Ottawa and the provinces, which puts them at an unfair disadvantage.
"We are listening to both sides intently," says Daniel Lauzon, spokesman for Finance Minister Bill Morneau.
"While we're broadly supportive of streamlining customs processing and importation requirements, when it comes to waiving duties and taxes, we need to carefully consider the impact that would have on Canadians and on Canadian businesses," he wrote later, in a magnificent bit of boilerplate echoed by Chrystia Freeland's spokesman.
Ad hoc
Andrea Stairs, CEO of eBay Canada, says the status quo is ad hoc and shambolic.
"There is no effective de minimis level right now," she says.
Canadian travellers are given a different limit than Canadian online shoppers. And while courier services faithfully turn every shipment over $20 to a customs broker, Canada Post is more haphazard, taking in shipments from the U.S. Postal Service and "literally dumping parcels on a conveyor belt" for Canada Customs to peruse.
Andrea Stairs, CEO of eBay Canada, says packages worth more than the $20 Canadian threshold are more likely to have taxes and duty added if they're sent via courier rather than by post. (Canada Post) As a result, consumers who insist a purchase be sent by post instead of courier can easily find a shipment worth much more than the $20 threshold on their doorstep, unopened, untaxed, with no duty or broker's fee added.
Like the coalition behind the online petition, eBay badly wants the de minimis level raised. So does Amazon, but neither e-commerce giant is ready yet to use the power and reach of their websites to appeal directly to Canadian customers, which, says one lobbyist involved in the effort, "would mean game over by tomorrow morning," but which would also annoy the government.
"We've preferred working with the government to get it to move," says Stairs. "And we've done some scholarly work." (That's a reference to a recent C.D. Howe-reviewed study that basically concluded the government spends dollars to collect dimes for the sake of protecting retailers.)
Lauzon, the finance minister's spokesman, says the government intends to consult Canadians "widely" about the issue in the months to come.
And almost certainly, the subject will come up during the Three Amigos summit this week. The U.S. takes every opportunity to press for a de minimis increase.
But the reality is plain: unless Canadian consumers speak, and loudly, the milking machine will remain in place. There is no force more powerful than the status quo.​
Can You Survive Dying Light?
by Travis Huber
Ok. So anyone who knows me knows that I love a good zombie game. They also know that I love a good FPS title. But with the exception of the Left 4 Dead series of games, I rarely have found a first-person zombie fest that has kept my attention. Well, for those of you who find yourself in the same predicament, I have found your solution. Dying Light has brought back the fun of a great survival horror game and even added in a little different twist to it.
The game starts with a news briefing about the city of Harran that has been infected by an unknown virus. So the government decided to build a hasty wall around the city and quarantine everyone in it. The only trouble is that the rest of the world started helping the ones who had survived and were trapped inside the quarantine wall. They air-dropped food, supplies and most importantly, antizen. Antizen is the medication that helps keep you human longer once you've been bitten by an infected person. But in order to get the antizen that gets dropped in, you have to fight your way through a growing number of zombies that are very keen to motion on their level and sound. They like to pack up and chase down whatever piques their interest.
That's where things get a little fresh. For those of you who loved Mirror's Edge, you can rest easy knowing that you have found a new home for intense, first-person parkour action. The only two ways to survive in Harran are killing the infected or running, but you can't just run on the streets, they belong to the infected. You have to use everything in your environment to your advantage. The traversal techniques and controls take a little getting used to, but once you do, you can mad-dash your way through the city and attack an enemy and then disappear.

The whole point of your being in Harran in the first place is to find the would-be leader of the city, who has gone rogue and stolen top-secret documents concerning the origins of the virus as well as the early-stage vaccine trials. So you parachute your way into town, only to land and get your ass kicked by some locals. Then you get saved by someone else after you uncork a couple of pistol rounds that bring the zombies in herds. You get rescued by a guy and a girl and the guy dies trying to save you. Once you get to safety, you realize that you have infiltrated a survivor and now switch to using them as a cover so you can work your way in close to the leader and the documents. But will you view things the same way as you near your objective? Well, you'll just have to find out for yourself.
Now that the story bit is out of the way, let's talk shop for a minute, beginning with the most evident thing, the graphics. I have to tell you that I am truly blown away by how gorgeous this game looks. From every angle and every vantage point, the sprawling, desolate city has been created in vivid detail and the lighting effects help to create a sense of realism to your plight that can even make you feel a little like this event could actually happen. Or at least, if it did happen, this is what a decimated major city would look like. There were a few framerate issues during early gameplay, but they could have been due to the fact that the game was installing while I was playing it. But even still, the issues were there. However, apart from this one little thing, I found no other fault with the graphical content. Animations were fluid and timely and well-synced with the voice audio and atmospheric audio.
And since we're on the topic of audio, let's get deeper into that. The voice acting is top-drawer for this title. Seriously, this is some of the better voice acting I have heard in a long time. The voices aided in fleshing out the characters and made them memorable–which is a good thing since you spend most of your time listening to them on a radio, rather than actually seeing them. Beyond the voice audio the soundtrack is incredibly well done. It helps to add to the overall effect of whatever is going on at the moment but is ambient enough to not become a distractor. There was a time or two that I thought things got a little loud, but that's a personal thing more than a technical issue. So overall, I think that the audio couldn't have been any more spot-on than it was.
Next let's talk control. As previously stated, this game introduces a first-person parkour traversal system that can either be a huge asset, or your worst nightmare. I am not going to lie to you–if you have never played a game in first-person with super-fast movements and vertical movement as well as horizontal, you may be in for a surprise. You might even need some Dramamine before attempting this one. The pacing is frenetic at best when you are trying to escape the hordes of undead while trying to secure food and supplies. The controls take a little bit to get used to and I feel like some of the buttons are a little counter-intuitive in their placement (but that may be because I have been playing a solid amount of Assassin's Creed IV lately as well). Be that as it may, once you get the hang of it, you can literally fly your way through line after line of traversals that will put a huge amount of distance between you and your assailants.
In less than three months Ireland will vote on whether to allow marriage equality – and opinion polls suggest that the once staunchly Catholic nation may be ready to vote yes.
But that result is not guaranteed; even now, a fifth of people remain undecided about marriage equality. The battle for “middle Ireland” is on.
This makes it even more remarkable that – in stark contrast to Australia or the United States – every one of Ireland's major political parties has come out in favour of a yes vote in the referendum.
So how has Ireland got to the brink of allowing marriage equality? And what are the lessons for marriage equality supporters elsewhere, including in Australia?
What the referendum is about
The referendum will be held on May 22, with the result announced the following day – conveniently the day of the Eurovision, fondly nicknamed by some as the “Gay Christmas”.
Last month, the Irish government released the wording that people will be voting yes or no to, which is:
Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.
The referendum follows on from Ireland's introduction of civil partnerships in January 2011. Campaigners for civil marriage have argued that there are 160 statutory differences between civil partnership and marriage, mainly in the areas of taxation, children and adoption.
The most pressing of those issues involves adoption rights for same-sex couples. This will be addressed separately in the Children and Family Relationships Bill, which was published mid-February.
The case for and against
Even though the referendum is not about parental rights, the debate about it has so far largely focused on children and defending the traditional view of marriage.
The Iona Institute for religion and society, a socially conservative Catholic advocacy group, has outlined its argument for sticking with “man-woman marriage” only, “for the sake of the children”.
Alliance for the Family and Marriage
Another group, known as the Alliance for the Family and Marriage, has been criticised for handing out leaflets with unsubstantiated claims about “active homosexual persons” contracting cancer, dying 20 years sooner than average and abusing their own children.
Of course, in all good referendum campaigns the alternative viewpoint has to be made available. In Ireland, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland requires that there is a balance of viewpoints.
So along with the case for the no vote, Irish voters have been watching videos like this one, which argues against the points made in the Iona Institute video.
Wooing middle Ireland
Both sides of the debate agree that the referendum will be won by whoever does the best job of convincing “middle Ireland”.
All the major political parties – Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin – are campaigning for a yes vote.
This is a remarkable shift, particularly for the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil parties, which have historically been more conservative on social issues.
Enda Kenny, the Taoiseach (prime minister) and leader of the Fine Gael party, had previously insisted he did not want to be “pressurised on marriage equality”.
But Kenny has since talked about his own “personal journey” and is now campaigning strongly for a yes vote, declaring last month: “I think it is time to do this so it's a people's choice.”
Kenny became the first Taoiseach to visit a gay bar in December 2014, attending his party's lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans group's Christmas celebration, the significance of which cannot be overlooked.
Added to this journey has been the coming out of current and former members of parliament. Most notable of these has been Health Minister Leo Varadkar, who is touted as a future leader of the Fine Gael party.
Last weekend, the majority governing party Fine Gael held its annual conference in rural Ireland. Speaking on February 21, the Taoiseach delivered a clear message on the referendum, declaring:
A yes vote would send out a powerful signal internationally that Ireland has evolved into a fair, compassionate and tolerant nation.
What about Australia?
The shift in Irish politics is in sharp contrast to the situation in Australia.
In June 2014, Australian Marriage Equality commissioned Crosby Textor – the main research firm used by the Liberal Party over many years – to survey 1000 Australians on their views about marriage equality.
Crosby Textor's polling showed support for marriage equality had reached a new high of 72% of those surveyed. The survey also found majority support in every demographic, including people of faith, people in regional and rural areas and older people.
Crosby Textor polling, commissioned by Australian Marriage Equality
A renewed push to allow same-sex marriage in Australia began this month, with a phone campaign targeting federal MPs. But deep divisions remain on both sides of the parliament.
Beyond the well-known difference of opinion between Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (in favour of the status quo) and his colleague Malcolm Turnbull (in favour of change), National Party MPs have reportedly said they would require a “written guarantee” that Turnbull wouldn't pursue same-sex marriage if he topples Abbott as Liberal leader.
Late last year, Labor leader Bill Shorten declared to the Australian Christian Lobby's national conference that “I believe in God and I believe in marriage equality”.
But not everyone in Labor shares Shorten's view. Last year it emerged that Western Australian Labor senator Joe Bullock had attacked his ALP running-mate Louise Pratt as a “poster child” for causes such as gay marriage at a dinner organised by a Christian society. He also said he'd be willing to be expelled from Labor rather than vote for same-sex marriage.
This issue is not going to go away in Australia. Liberal Democratic Party senator David Leyonhjelm is pushing for a conscience vote, arguing “it's not the government's business to be telling people who they can and can't marry”. Leyonhjelm said earlier this month that he may block government legislation until a free vote is granted, ideally before the May budget.
That means Ireland is not the only country counting down to a May deadline.
Polls show the level of support for equal marriage rights in Ireland and Australia is remarkably similar: 71% in Ireland and 72% in Australia.
What middle Ireland and middle Australia say about this issue is not so different after all. Instead, the key difference between the countries is that in Australia politicians supposedly elected to represent the will of the people are choosing not to listen.
In her 2015 speech to the Conservative conference, Theresa May declared: "We welcome students coming to study. But the fact is, too many of them are not returning home as soon as their visa runs out. If they have a graduate job, that is fine. If not, they must return home. So I don't care what the university lobbyists say: the rules must be enforced. Students, yes; overstayers, no."
The belief that tens of thousands of students were overstaying their visas was used to justify their inclusion in the Conservatives' net migration target (aimed at reducing migration to "tens of thousands" a year). But two remarkable new studies suggest the claim is entirely false. A Home Office paper based on "exit checks" found that that 176,317 – 97.4 per cent – of of 181,024 foreign students left on time or had their visas extended. This compares with a previous estimate that as many as 100,000 overstayed.
A separate Office for National Statistics study similarly debunks the claim. Exit checks found that of those whose visas expired in 2016 and 2017, 69 per cent left the UK, while 26 per cent extended their visas for further study or for work. The remaining 5 per cent had no identified record of departure or extension, or appeared to depart after their visa had expired.
As the ONS concludes: "There is no evidence of a major issue of non-EU students overstaying their entitlement to stay". Some have suggested that the findings prove total net migration is far lower than thought, putting the Conservatives within reach of their target, but the ONS advises caution on this point: "There may potentially be some 'offsetting' with other groups of migrants who will contribute to the total net migration figures in other ways. For example, there could be a group of emigrants who have a tendency to understate their duration from the UK – perhaps British emigrants who return home earlier than intended."
Regardless of the true figure, the data debacle does not inspire confidence in the UK's ability to design a coherent post-Brexit immigration system. May will also face renewed pressure to remove foreign students from the net migration target (Home Secretary Amer Rudd has belatedly launched an inquiry into their economic contribution). As George Osborne's Evening Standard recently said: not one senior cabinet minister supports the policy.
Last July, Boris Johnson and Amber Rudd both suggested that the target should be abandoned before being rebuked by No10 (Rudd did not even reference it in her recent FT article on immigration). Philip Hammond and Liam Fox have publicly argued that students should be excluded from the total. In view of all this, the target is likely to depart No10 when May does.
At the scene of a Los Angeles police officer-involved shooting in North Hills, Calif., on April 22, 2017.
NORTH HILLS (CBSLA.com) – Los Angeles police shot and injured a 25-year-old man who they say threatened officers with a gun in North Hills Saturday morning.
At about 6:15 a.m., officers responded to the area of Burnet Avenue and Rayen Street on a domestic violence call regarding a man who may be threatening a family member with a gun.
According to police, when officers arrived, they encountered a suspect who threatened to shoot them. Police said that the suspect refused to comply with their directives. The officers deployed bean bags and tasers prior to firing at him. The man was shot in the torso, police said. He was transported to a nearby hospital in critical condition. No officers were hurt.
A gun and knife were recovered at the scene. Police did not confirm if the suspect opened fire or how many officers shot their weapons at him. Police said all eight responding officers were wearing body cameras. The footage will be reviewed.
His name and the exact circumstances which precipitated the shooting were not immediately released.
While analyzing Gibson's novel and comparing it to all kinds of scientific and technological projects or with vulgarized or techno-prophetical literature, what is striking is not so much the absolute originality of techno-scientific developments that one can find in Science-Fiction literature. What really changes is the setting or rather, the context, and the social environment. For too many scholars, engineers or popularisers, the social world is disconcertingly simple: everything goes, as if technologies were invented in a social vacuum, as if the surrounding world did not exist or at least, was motionless, without constraints and resistance. A utopian world, rigid and stiff, outside time and space. In contrast however, Science-Fiction re-establishes technologies in fiction, narratives, movement, society. In such a society, there are power struggles, needs for domination, there are human beings, desires, conflicts. Despite the apparent freedom or liberation provided by cyberspace, the characters in Neuromancer are no less typically submitted to constant coercion. Torn between the interests of multinationals, states, criminal organisations or autonomous artificial intelligences (usually very powerful), these characters do not really have free reign in having their bodies transformed. The labour market somehow dictates their choices. There is a sort of generalized competition leading to the wildest corporeal transformations. For instance, let us consider the ensuing consequences for a computer scientist: does he or she really needs a body for programming? A contract killer, a prostitute, a packer in space? Wouldn't it be useful to have several supplementary arms?
Couldn't an actor or actress be forced to have a camera implanted in the eye? One can imagine all sorts of examples. Rather than paying the services of a translator-interpreter, wouldn't it be faster and more advantageous to get an electronic implant in the brain? What is certain is that the reach of bodily transformations goes far beyond surgical or medical aspects. There are more important consequences and more data to consider: who can or must modify himself/herself, how and according to what criteria? It is not a simple task. In Gibson's novels, the body thwarts the soul's wandering and its disappearance into cyberspace. A key-passage shows Case, the hero, or rather “antihero”, during a coupling session to cyberspace: he is trapped by an artificial intelligence which has created a virtual space in order to keep him for neutralization. Things are very well organised: the hero finds himself on the beach of a fictitious ocean, where calm and serenity prevail. Linda, Case's deceased lover appears, numerically reconstituted. Case is not far from giving way to this illusion and forgets to come back to reality, thus abandoning his body and leaving it to die. In a world of absolute mobility and total flexibility, where We did not take the questions of definition into consideration. The basic difference between cyborgs and robots or androids resides in the fusion of a human being with a machine. Despite this minimal criterion, there are thousands of ways to be a cyborg: the implant of a “simple” pacemaker, the complete transformation of the body, the eye-camera, but also artificial limbs and organs, doped athletes, a soul downloaded into a network, etc. everything should constantly move and change, there are elements of stability, foundations that have to be stabilized. Although transformed in thousands of ways, the body in Neuromancer remains a fundamental anchor for one's identity.
CONCLUSION –
It lacked history, culture, even definition, and could therefore serve as a blank slate for cultural critique and a perfect expression of the desire to escape Lyotard's postmodern condition. According to Judith Halberstam, a feminist historian and theorist, Haraway's cyborg was “a condensed image of both imaginative and material reality, the two joined centers structuring any possibility of historical transformation.” This image was particularly useful for feminists who sought to avoid the ideological dangers of recourse to an “authentic” female identity, which is one of the main postmodern feminist criticisms of second-wave feminism, which will be discussed shortly. However, it seemed sensible to refer to relevant themes and precise examples in order to propose some perspectives for in-depth reflection. The next example is precisely aimed at attracting, once again, the reader's attention by proposing a final original perspective on cyborgs. This novel does not refer to any philosophical tradition but most of the narrative takes place in law courts. One can easily imagine problems such as succession, civil rights, property which can emerge from that situation. The soul of the character being trapped into a vacuum cleaner, one can ask whether the latter has become the owner of the family house? Is his insurance coverage still valid? Can he keep his passport? Is he still the father of his children? Such pragmatic aspects make us smile. But what would happen if that bizarre vacuum image is replaced by the body of a humanoid robot? The day human beings more closely resemble cyborgs, like Steve Austin and Duane Fitzgerald, will cause these questions to emerge.
Former prime minister says the Greens are aiding conservatives by reducing the ALP's ability to form government
Former Labor prime minister Paul Keating has turned his caustic wit on the Greens, labelling the party “a bunch of opportunists and Trots”.
Keating, who was prime minister between 1991 and 1996, told a Labor party rally in Sydney the Greens were aiding conservatives by reducing Labor's ability to form government.
It was his first public appearance of the 2016 election campaign.
“They're a protest party, not a party of government, but their game is to nobble the party of government that can actually make changes,” Keating said.
Too many variables and too many disaffected but narrow Coalition win likely Read more
“You can't be a government when you've got a bunch tearing away at you, trying to pinch a seat here and there, all to make themselves look important.”
Keating addressed the rally in aid of Labor shadow cabinet member Anthony Albanese, who is under pressure in his inner-western Sydney seat of Grayndler.
The seat has come under sustained Greens attack after electoral commission redistributions cut the traditional working-class stronghold of Marrickville, as well as Albanese's home and office, from the electorate.
Keating castigated the Greens for positioning themselves as the true Australian progressive party, saying it was Labor who introduced legislation to protect the Daintree, Jarvis Bay and Antarctica.
The Greens had also failed environmentalists by blocking an emissions trading scheme in 2009, he said.
“They purloined the name Greens. We're more green than they are,” he said.
“Ratting on Rudd with the ETS scheme and walking away from the Malaysia solution, things that required a bit of courage ... they could've been the yellows.”
Keating said the Labor party would always eschew ideology for “what works”.
He said easing monetary policy could no longer spur business investment, and governments now had to intervene with infrastructure spending to kickstart economies around the world.
Governments could no longer look to the market for fixing everything, he added: “Governments have tucked themselves away and let central banks lower interest rates in the hope, like lighting a match, if you strike it enough there might be a flame.”
“The model has to change. That means a bigger role for government in things like infrastructure (and) the provision of important public services.”
Image caption Swine flu infection boosted immunity to surprising degrees
People who recover from swine flu may be left with an extraordinary natural ability to fight off flu viruses, findings suggests.
In beating a bout of H1N1 the body makes antibodies that can kill many other flu strains, a study in the Journal of Experimental Medicine shows.
Doctors hope to harness this power to make a universal flu vaccine that would protect against any type of influenza.
Ultimately this could replace the "best guess" flu vaccines currently used.
Such a vaccine is the "holy grail" for flu researchers. Many scientists are already testing different prototypes to put an end to the yearly race to predict coming flu strains and quickly mass produce a new vaccine each flu season.
Dr Patrick Wilson who led the latest research said the H1N1 swine flu virus that reached pandemic levels infecting an estimated 60 million people last year, had provided a unique opportunity for researchers.
This work gives us more confidence that it will be possible to generate a universal flu vaccine Dr Sarah Gilbert, Flu vaccine expert at Oxford University
"It demonstrates how to make a single vaccine that could potentially provide immunity to all influenza.
"The surprise was that such a very different influenza strain, as opposed to the most common strains, could lead us to something so widely applicable."
Extraordinary immunity
In the nine patients they studied who had caught swine flu during the pandemic, they found the infection had triggered the production of a wide range of antibodies that are only very rarely seen after seasonal flu infections or flu vaccination.
Five antibodies isolated by the team could fight all the seasonal H1N1 flu strains from the last decade, the devastating "Spanish flu" strain from 1918 which killed up to 50m people, plus a potentially deadly bird flu H5N1 strain.
The researchers believe the "extraordinarily" powerful antibodies were created as the body learned how to fight the new infection with swine flu using its old memory of how to fight off other flu viruses.
Next they plan to examine the immune response of people who were vaccinated against last year's swine flu but did not get sick to see if they too have the same super immunity to flu.
Dr Sarah Gilbert is a expert in viruses at Oxford University and has been testing her own prototype universal flu vaccine.
She said: "Many scientists are working to develop a vaccine that would protect against the many strains of flu virus.
"This work gives us more confidence that it will be possible to generate a universal flu vaccine."
But she said it would take many years for a product to go through the necessary tests and trials.
"It will take at least five years before anything like this could be widely available."
The number of deaths this winter from flu verified by the Health Protection Agency currently is 50, with 45 of these due to swine flu.
Elon — half a billion dollars, the biggest commercial launch deal in history. Reinforces fact that Falcon 9 is vehicle of choice not just for NASA but also for commercial sector. Also a lot of international customers. Good thing for US in particular because vehicles are built 100% in the US. US hasn't been cost competitive in launch market, but are now.
2015-2017 for launch. Expect a couple dozen launches before then.
Bobby Block: What does mean in terms of what you'll be looking for from the government to accelerate both crew and cargo?
Elon: Won't make much difference, but does validate the NASA's approach. Over the long term the cost to NASA and the taxpayer will be less because fixed costs will be divided by larger number of launches. Dragon is currently long pole, and this deal doesn't affect that.
Block: People talking about Shuttle extension and more flights. If Shuttle is extended will it affect COTS?
Elon: Doesn't see it affecting things. Assume that everyone knows that extending/restarting not a viable option. An extra Shuttle flight will cost a lot of money, more than SpaceX is getting for the entire NASA constract.
Claire Moskowitz: When launching out of Vandenberg?
Elon: Two years from now, roughly. Using SLC-4, former Titan IV facility (just like at the Cape). So they have a good understanding of what it takes to convert, 12-18 months.
Moskowitz: How about Taiwan launch on Falcon 1e?
Elon: Been in discussion for a couple years. Planning to do a number of Falcon 1e launches. Over forty launches manifested by the end of the year.
Alan Boyle: How many launches is the contract? About ten? One more provider to receive lion's share?
Elon: No insight into other provider. SpaceX is primary provider, so other will be a backup or secondary. Can't comment on exact number of launches, depends on final satellite configuration.
Elon: Most of the money goes to satellite production, the half billion is just the launch piece. Part of the cost is dispenser development, so it's not all launch costs.
MSNBC: When is next launch, and what is cash situation (talking about Pasztor's billion-dollar number).
Elon: Pasztor's article rife with errors. In good financial shape but may take on debt for working capital. May also take in strategic investor. Next launch toward end of summer. Falcon 9 carrying operational version of Dragon.
Todd Halvorson: What is total backlog of Falcon 1/9 launches?
Elon: Low thirties in terms of backlog. Will be over forty by the end of the year.
Halvorson: Assuming that Iridium are polar, will any be equatorial?
Elon: Some chance of equatorial, but all current plans high inclination.
Irene Klotz: Location of Falcon 1e with Taiwan satellite?
Elon: Kwaj.
Klotz: How much to convert SLC-4 for Falcon 9?
Elon: $40-$50M.
Klotz: Who was competition for Iridium?
Elon: Everyone. French satellite, so no restrictions on American content issue. Global competition.
Klotz: How is data analysis from flight going?
Elon: Not a lot to report. It went great. Slight roll anomaly isolated to probably the roll-control actuator, but still not positive, still seeking internal consensus. A little too concerned that it went too good. Will be looking for “near misses” to prepare for next flight.
Space News: Is contract for all seventy two birds, or just a piece of the Constellation?
Elon: Doesn't want to discuss that, ask Iridium.
ALan Boyle: Any better sense of how long the Dragon test article will stay in orbit? Is there another client for the mission, perhaps classified? Can you say anything?
Elon: Laughs, can neither confirm nor deny. Dragon will stay up for a year or two, and burn up on entry.
Halvorson: Comment on how SpaceX operates versus legacy companies in terms of costs?
Elon: Doesn't like to give sound bites — oversimplifies. Needs to write a paper on it. Like asking why Southwest is cheaper. Not just because they use 737s. SpaceX operates on a Silicon Valley OS and DNA. Sort of like an Intel or Apple or Google of space transport. Vertical integration helps also, once problems are solved. Too much outsourcing in traditional aerospace. They cut out middlemen. Using legacy components means inheriting legacy cost structure. Tightly integrated team, with factory on the same floor as engineering. Everyone in a cube, including him. Also, very simple, with same propellants in both stages. Upper stage simply a short version of first stage. Same engine on both stages, so lots of economies of scale from Merlin.
Klotz: Launch escape in house, or contract?
Elon: Building liquid escape engines into sidewall of Dragon, which will be safety improvement over solid. Won't have to eject a tower. Having something that you have to eject every flight seems like a crazy idea. Will have escape capability all the way to orbit.
International Business: Is this part of the two and a half billion in contracts?
Elon: Yes, it's about $2.7B, including this, through 2017, but bulk over the next five years.
Are Chinese competition?
Yes, when international customer.
How much financial margin? Can you avoid the Sea Launch problem?
Elon: Cash flow not significantly affected even in stand down. Sea Launch suffered from single-point failure of launch platform. Tough to recover from. SpaceX has site flexibility of Vandenberg, Cape and Kwaj.
Space News: Might want to check out if Chinese were eligible to bid for Iridium work.
Elon: Not sure they were, just thought they were because of French satellite. You may know more than me, but didn't think there was an ITAR issue.
Conference over.
[Update a few minutes later]
The one question that I didn't capture was mine. I asked him if they knew yet why the first stage didn't survive entry, or if they would have to wait for another flight to get better data (because they didn't get the microwave imaging data they wanted). He said that they still didn't know, and might not figure it out until they try again. I followed up, asking if he could conceive of a time that they might just give up on it, and pull the recovery systems out to give them more payload. I was surprised at the vehemence of his answer (paraphrasing): “We will never give up! Never! Reusability is one of the most important goals. If we become the biggest launch company in the world, making money hand over fist, but we're still not reusable, I will consider us to have failed.” I told him that I was very gratified to hear that, because I like reusability.
[Early afternoon update]
Here's Bobby Block's report on the presser.
Geniocracy is the framework for a system of government which was first proposed by Raël (leader of the International Raëlian Movement) in 1977 and which advocates problem-solving, creative intelligence and compassion as criteria for governance.[1]
Definition [ edit ]
Geniocracy: Government of the People, for the People, by the Geniuses (Printed for the first time in English: 2008 Nova Distribution.) The book cover of Rael 's book(Printed for the first time in English: 2008 Nova Distribution.)
The term geniocracy comes from the word genius, and describes a system that is designed to select for intelligence and compassion as the primary factors for governance. While having a democratic electoral apparatus, it differs from traditional liberal democracy by instead suggesting that candidates for office and the body electorate should meet a certain minimal criterion of problem-solving or creative intelligence. The thresholds proposed by the Raëlians are 50% above the mean for an electoral candidate and 10% above the mean for an elector.[1]
Justifying the method of selection [ edit ]
This method of selectivity is deliberate so as to address what the concept considers to be flaws in the current systems of democracy. The primary object of criticism is the inability of majoritarian consensus to provide a reasonable platform for intelligent decision making for the purpose of solving problems permanently. Geniocracy's criticism of this system is that the institutions of democracy become more concerned with appealing to popular consensus through emotive issues than they are in making long-term critical decisions, especially those that may involve issues not immediately relevant to the electorate. It asserts that political mandate is something far too important to simply leave to popularity, and asserts that the critical decision making required for government, especially in a world of globalization, cannot be based on criteria of emotive or popular decision making. In this respect, Geniocracy derides liberal democracy as a form of "Mediocracy".[1] In a geniocracy Earth would be ruled by a worldwide Geniocratic government.[2]
History [ edit ]
Origins in Ancient Greece [ edit ]
An early precursor to geniocracy is the political ideas of Plato. Considered to be the first political scientist, Plato believed government should be ruled by "philosopher kings" with high intelligence and compassion. His Allegory of the Cave exemplifies these ideas. He believed the masses to be too uneducated to rule.
Agenda [ edit ]
Part of the geniocratic agenda is to promote the idea of a world government system, deriding the current state-system as inadequate for dealing with contemporary global issues that are typical of globalisation, such as environmentalism, social justice, human rights, and the current economic system. In line with this, geniocracy proposes a different economic model called Economic Humanitarianism.[1]
Response to criticism [ edit ]
As a response to its controversial attitudes about selectivity, one of the more general responses is to point out that universal suffrage, the current system, already discriminates to some degree and varyingly in different countries, in who is allowed to vote. Primarily, this discrimination is against minors, foreigners, incarcerated felons, and the mentally incapacitated. This is on the basis that their ability to contribute to the decision making process is either flawed or invalid for the purpose of the society.[citation needed]
Status [ edit ]
The current difficulty in the ideas of geniocracy is that the means of assessing intelligence are ill-defined. One idea offered by Raël in Geniocracy is to have specialists such as psychologists, neurologists, ethnologists, etc., perfect or choose among existing ones, a series of tests that would define each person's level of intelligence. They should be designed to measure intellectual potential rather than accumulation of knowledge.
Other components deemed necessary for a more rounded understanding of intelligence include concepts like emotional intelligence. As such, geniocracy's validity cannot really be assessed until better and more objective methods of intelligence assessment are made available.
The matter of confronting moral problems that may arise is not addressed in the book Geniocracy; many leaders may be deeply intelligent and charismatic (having both high emotional/social intelligence and IQ) according to current means of measuring such factors, but no current scientific tests are a reliable enough measure for one's ability to make humanitarian choices (although online tests such as those used by retail chains to select job applicants may be relevant).[citation needed]
The lack of scientific rigour necessary for inclusion of geniocracy as properly testable political ideology can be noted in number of modern and historical dictatorships as well as oligarchies. Because of the controversies surrounding geniocracy, Raël presents the idea as a classic utopia or provocative ideal and not necessarily a model that humanity will follow.[3]
Democratically defined regions [ edit ]
The author of Geniocracy recommends (though does not necessitate) a world government with 12 regions. Inhabitants would vote for which region they want to be part of. After the regions are defined, they are further divided into 12 sectors after the same principle of democracy is applied. While sectors of the same region are defined as having equal numbers of inhabitants, the regions themselves may have different levels of population, which would be proportional to its voting power.[1]

(CNN) From his bed next to the window, Jadon squeezes his father's finger with all his might, even under heavy sedation. Anias rests in a bed near the door of the room, a testament to strength and resilience.
Just the sight of the boys in separate beds came as a surprise to their parents.
"It's shockingly new," said their mother, Nicole McDonald. The boys have shared a bed since birth.
Born conjoined at the head, the 13-month-old twins -- little "warriors," their parents call them -- spent the weekend recovering from the 27-hour surgery that separated them.
"I can't wait to put them beside each other and them see each other," said Christian, their father. "To be honest, I'm just so excited and anxious to see that moment. That's going to be a great day."
Photos: Conjoined twins at the head prepare to be separated Anias and Jadon McDonald were born conjoined at the head on September 9, 2015, via an unscheduled C-section. "They were normal little boys, like any other two little babies you would see," said their father Christian McDonald, "except for being conjoined."

72 critical hours
The surgery -- which began early Thursday and ended shortly before 1 p.m. Friday -- took place at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. It was led by neurosurgeon Dr. James Goodrich, considered the leading expert on what's known as craniopagus surgery.
The first 72 hours of recovery were most critical for long-term survival, doctors told the parents. Christian said the boys were stable and doing well after a weekend of challenges.
Anias suffered a few seizures on Saturday, including one that lasted for 45 minutes, Christian said. The seizures have since been brought under control with the anti-seizure medicine Ativan, he said.
Jadon has yet to move his left side. Though that is troubling, Christian remains optimistic. "That's not something really worrying Dr. Goodrich right now," the father said. "He says that's not out of the ordinary. Hopefully, in time, he will start moving that side."
Both boys have opened their eyes, although they are heavily sedated and hooked up to an array of medical equipment. They're too fragile for Mom and Dad to pick them up just yet.
"Jadon will squeeze your fingers and not let go, on his right side," said Christian. "They're really doing pretty good, considering the surgery they went through."
The parents are now in a waiting game as to when Jadon and Anias become fully alert.
Goodrich and lead plastic surgeon Dr. Oren Tepper said in a joint statement Monday afternoon that "so far, the recovery course has gone as expected."
"We are hoping to be able to extubate Jadon in the upcoming days, and Anias we expect to take longer as we work to control his blood pressure issues," the doctors said.
They added that both boys would probably have to undergo more reconstruction surgery: "We expect that parts of the incisions on both boys' heads will need some revision."
Long recovery ahead
The separation surgery was the fourth procedure for the boys -- and the most complicated. The twins awoke from the first two surgeries after about a week; after the third surgery, it took about a month "for them to be back to themselves," Christian said.
He expects a similar recovery this time. "The more difficult the surgery," he said, "the longer the recovery."
Dad spent a good bit of time this weekend bonding with the couple's 3-year-old son, Aza, while Mom camped out in the twins' room, loving every second of the reunion.
One of the most poignant moments occurred Friday afternoon as the parents waited for Anias to get out of surgery. Jadon had been wheeled out of the operating room about 7 that morning and brought up to the pediatric intensive care unit, or PICU, but Anias' operation was taking much longer.
Christian plopped to the floor of the PICU. Nicole bent over in agony. They'd been told Anias would be brought there any moment, but a 20-minute wait turned into an hour.
"Come on, little Anias," Dad said. "I can't wait to see you, Buddy."
Suddenly, about 1 p.m., medical personnel with dark circles under their eyes emerged from the elevator. Nicole stood with her hands clasped in prayer, Christian by her side. He wiped a tear from his right eye and put his arm around his wife of four years.
They'd waited for this moment since the boys were born at 11:11 p.m. on September 9, 2015 -- and even before that, when they first learned in May 2015 that the boys were conjoined in utero.
Their faces lit up when Anias was wheeled out. Excruciating agony gave way to pure joy and raw emotion. Nicole immediately kissed Anias on his left cheek, tears flowing down her face.
"Hey, Buddy, you look beautiful," Christian said, leaning in for a kiss and blowing on his forehead. "I love you, Pumpkin. You look just like your brother."
Anias was carefully pushed down the hall into the same corner room with Jadon.
Family reunited
Two nights earlier, in the same room, the boys had shared one bed. Christian had climbed into it, while Nicole read them the children's book "I Love You All The Same."
"You are strong, you are smart, you are happy," Nicole told them as they drifted to sleep.

And now here the family was, together. There was even beauty with the exact time of separation, at 2:11 a.m. -- when the two conjoined boys became one and one.
Over the weekend, Nicole took to Facebook to thank the "heroes" at Montefiore -- from Goodrich to his nurse practitioner, from Tepper to anesthesiologists, from nurses to volunteers.
"As absolutely humbled as I am for all of the encouraging messages I've received, it's hard for me to take any credit for the miracle that these boys are," Nicole wrote . "All I did was birth beautiful, unique children and love them with all I have. There are mothers everywhere who do that on a daily basis. I'd like to direct the attention back to the true heroes of our story."
Both parents gave up their jobs and moved from their Illinois town of 5,000 to the Bronx to be near the hospital. They've been relying on donations to make ends meet over the last year, overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from complete strangers.
Since the surgery started, their GoFundMe page has swelled from some $50,000 to more than $250,000. The family is now asking anyone who wants to help the twins to instead make a donation to a family friend whose child is in need of a kidney transplant.
Faith and healing
Messages of support from strangers proved a powerful distraction during the hours of waiting while the twins were in surgery, Christian said. He and Nicole said they felt the love and prayers sent their way. They monitored the hashtag #JadonAndAnias as people tweeted about "our beautiful boys."
"If it wasn't for all these people sending us messages and donating, we wouldn't have been able to keep such a positive outlook," Christian said.
"What I really want to say to the thousands who supported us," Christian said, "is that we are blown away how total strangers can and do love our boys so much. And their love for our boys poured out of them through their messages and donations."
And that's something the McDonald's say they will never forget. It's been "a long, hard journey getting to this point," Christian added.

"We're finally seeing the fruits of our labors and our long, hard nights."
In her Facebook post, Nicole said her family also couldn't have made it this far if it weren't for their faith.
"Without God we would have unraveled many, many months ago," she said. "People say we have handled this situation with grace, but it's with God's grace that we continue on."
Police have moved in on a number of Occupy Oakland demonstrators who began occupying a foreclosed property at 16th and Broadway, and started launching tear gas at them. The police officers, who appear to be from the Alameda County Sheriff's Department, have warned that they will be arresting any demonstrators who remain in the building.
The live-streaming video from globalrevolution at livestream.com is down at present, but there are reports of a fire having broken out in the street.
This appears to be the first incident of police engaging demonstrators. The General Strike and rally in support of it yesterday were almost entirely peaceful, apart from some minor vandalism to a few buildings by people who do not appear to have been connected with Occupy Oakland.
The crowd in attendance was estimated at between 10,000 to 15,000 people, and the Occupy Oakland activists were successful in achieving one of their main goals: that of shutting down the Port of Oakland. Congratulations and many thanks to all who participated in today's rally!

Our gut microbiomes -- the varieties of microbes living in our digestive tracts -- may play a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since dogs can also suffer from IBD, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine analyzed fecal samples from dogs with and without the disease. They discovered a pattern of microbes indicative of IBD in dogs. With more than 90 percent accuracy, the team was able to use that information to predict which dogs had IBD and which did not. However, they also determined that the gut microbiomes of dogs and humans are not similar enough to use dogs as animal models for humans with this disease.
The study is published October 3 in Nature Microbiology.
"One of the really frustrating things about IBD in humans is that it's hard to diagnose -- it usually requires intestinal biopsies, which are not only imperfect, but invasive and expensive to collect," said senior author Rob Knight, PhD, professor in the Departments of Pediatrics at UC San Diego School of Medicine and Computer Science and Engineering and director of the Center for Microbiome Innovation at UC San Diego.
According to Knight, most people with IBD have similar changes in the types of microbes living in their intestinal tracts, relative to healthy people. Yet it's still difficult to discern healthy people from those with IBD just by looking at the microbes in their fecal samples. In addition, Knight said it's not yet clear whether the microbial patterns associated with IBD contribute to the disease's cause or are a result of the disease.
In a separate line of study, pets appear to be a conduit for microbe sharing in a house. Knight and collaborators previously found that microbial communities on adult skin are on average more similar to those of their own dogs than to other dogs. With a fair amount of precision, they can pick your dog out of a crowd based solely on overlap in your microbiomes.
In this latest study, Knight and team collected fecal samples from 85 healthy dogs and 65 dogs with chronic signs of gastrointestinal disease and inflammatory changes confirmed by pathology. To determine which microbial species were living in each sample, they used a technique Knight and collaborators popularized, called 16S rRNA sequencing, to quickly identify millions of bacterial species living in a mixed sample, based on the unique genes they harbor.
With this information, the researchers were able to look for similarities and differences in the microbial species found in IBD and non-IBD dogs. The differences were significant enough that they could distinguish IBD dog feces from non-IBD with more than 90 percent accuracy.
The researchers also compared the dog data to 2014 parallel findings in humans. The team found some similarities in the microbial interactions of IBD samples between dogs and humans, however the overlap was only partial. For example, Fusobacterium bacteria are associated with diseases in humans, but in dogs was associated with the non-IBD samples.
The study's first author, Yoshiki Vázquez-Baeza, a graduate student in UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering's Department of Computer Science and Engineering and a member of Knight's lab, noted a potential limitation of the study -- there were fewer healthy human samples than IBD samples in the 2014 human data set. But to best of their knowledge, he said, their statistical methods should not be affected by that.
"One of the really nice things about this study is that all of the statistical software packages we used to analyze data are available online, and anyone can see our exact calculations," said Vázquez-Baeza. "Too often we read about a study with interesting conclusions, but it's not completely clear how the authors got there. This approach is more open and transparent."
This approach to diagnosing IBD in dogs is not yet available to veterinarians or dog owners, Vázquez-Baeza said. Moving forward, the researchers would like to study the overlap in IBD and non-IBD gut microbiomes among a series of animals. Zoo animals, for example, experience IBD more often than their wild counterparts, and studying them might help Knight, Vázquez-Baeza and team find key microbial players in IBD across species.
IBD is a family of diseases that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. IBD is characterized by chronic inflammation in the digestive tract, which can cause pain, severe diarrhea and weight loss. IBD can be debilitating and sometimes leads to life-threatening complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that more than 1 million Americans are living with IBD.
The preliminary Texas RRC Production Data is out this morning. There appears to be a considerable drop in Texas crude oil production in April. All Texas RRC data in the charts below is through April 2015 and all EIA data is through March 2015.
For those new to this site, the Texas RRC data is incomplete. The drooping lines will eventually, after the final data comes in, closer resemble the EIA data. Though I believe the EIA data is quite a bit too high at this point.
It appears that, when the final data comes in that Texas will have taken a huge hit in January, recovered somewhat in February and March, then took another hit this past April.
Dr. Dean Fantazzini, with his algorithm that calculates the final production numbers, also comes to the conclusion that Texas took a hit in April production. Dean has three results with the most probable in the middle.
Texas Crude only, in April, when the final data comes in, should be slightly above January but still well below December.
Dean's corrected data shows Texas crude only declining in January, recovering in February and March, then declining again in April.
Condensate took a far greater hit in April than did crude only. This is likely because natural gas production in April took a bigger hit than did oil production.
This is Dean's take on what Texas Condensate will be when the final data comes in. December appears to be the peak… so far.
There is no doubt that North Dakota, the USA's second largest producer, is down since December. And I believe the data clearly shows that Texas, the USA's largest crude oil producer by far, is down also. Then how is it possible that the EIA has US Production up so much since December?
In the chart above as well as the one below, the weekly production data are the averaged per month. The June weekly numbers are the average of the last two weeks reported data.
This is what the three different reporting departments say has happened to US C+C production since December 2014. I believe this will turn out to be the largest production error in the history of the agency.
It appears that Texas Natural Gas took a bigger hit than did oil. All natural gas data is in MCF.
This is Dean's estimate of what the final Texas natural gas production will look like. The peak, so far, is in December, just like crude oil.
Texas gas well gas peaked way back in April of 2009. In April it was Texas gas well gas that took the biggest hit of all.
Texas associated gas did not take nearly the hit that gas well gas did. This is gas from oil wells. So it appears that even though oil production did take a hit in April, natural gas took an even bigger hit.
The North Dakota Director's Cut is just out.
Mar Sweet Crude Price = $31.47/barrel
Apr Sweet Crude Price = $38.33/barrel
May Sweet Crude Price = $44.70/barrel
Today's Sweet Crude Price = $48.00/barrel (all-time high was $136.29 7/3/2008)
Mar rig count 108
Apr rig count 91
May rig count 83
Today's rig count is 79 (lowest since December 2009)(all-time high was 218 on 5/29/2012)
The statewide rig count is down 64% from the high.
Comments:
The drilling rig count dropped 17 from March to April, 8 more from April to May, and has since fallen 4 more from May to today. Operators have each been experimenting with running 1 to 2 fewer rigs than their planned 2015 minimum to see if drill times and efficiencies will continue to improve. This has resulted in a current active drilling rig count that is 5 to 8 rigs below what was operators indicated would be their 2015 average if oil price remained below $65/barrel. The number of well completions dropped sharply from 244(final) in March to 94(preliminary) in April. Continued oil price weakness anticipated to last into next year is by far the primary reason for the slow-down. There was one significant precipitation event in the Dickinson area, 10 days with wind speeds in excess of 35 mph (too high for completion work), and no days with temperatures below -10F.
At the end of April there were an estimated 925 wells waiting on completion services, an increase of 45. To maintain production near 1.2 million barrels per day, 110-120 completions must be made per month.
Drilling permit activity decreased slightly from March to April and significantly more from April to May as operators positioned themselves for low price 2015 budget scenarios.
Helms is saying that wells awaiting completion increased by 45. This makes no sense whatsoever. Wells completed in April totaled 153. Spuds were 129 in March and 94 in April. How on earth did “Wells Drilled” increase by 45 above “Wells Completed”?

India will surpass China as the fastest growing petroleum product market in Asia with fuel consumption rising 6 per centin 2018, Moody's Investors Service said today citing EIA data.
As economic activity in China dials back, Moody's said it expects its refined product demand growth will moderate to 2.5 -3 percent in 2017-18, compared with compounded annual growth rate of 5 percent in 2012-16.
"Nonetheless, in absolute terms, the EIA says China will account for 48% of Asia's R&M sector's demand growth in 2018. In comparison, India will surpass China as the fastest growing product market in Asia with petroleum consumption growing 6 percent in 2018," it said.
Moody's said the outlook for the Asian oil refining and marketing sector is stable, with the EBITDA of rated companies growing a modest 5 percent through 2018.
"Driven by China's and India's appetite for petroleum products and continued capacity rationalisation, we believe refining margins will remain firm, thereby supporting the growth in earnings," says Rachel Chua, a Moody's Assistant Vice President and Analyst.
It expected the average Asian refining margins to be largely in line with the average of $ 6.2 per barrel for the last three years, but better than $ 5.1 per barrel in 2016.
"The recent forced closure of about a quarter of US refining capacity has created an undersupply situation, causing fuel prices including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to surge. Nonetheless, we expect the recent spike in crack spreads and refining margins to temper and normalise as the supply crunch eases gradually," Chua said.
In its report, "Refining and marketing- Asia, Outlook stable on modest EBITDA growth and firm refining margins", Moody's said it expects the fundamental business conditions in the sector to continue over the next 12-18 months and have been stable since October 2014, when Moody's initiated its outlook opinion.
Supply and demand will vary by country, but for the region as a whole, Moody's estimates that Asia's incremental growth in demand for fuel of around 0.7 million barrels per day (bpd) will outpace net refining capacity additions of 0.4 -0.5 million bpd over the next 12-18 months.
At the same time, the bulk of the incremental growth in refining capacity will come from China and Vietnam.
"Still, with demand growth surpassing capacity additions over the last five years, Asia is likely to remain a net importer of refined petroleum products over at least the next three years," it said.
Asian refiners, it said, continue to be exposed to the economic slowdown in China, industry cyclicality and geopolitical risks, despite our stable outlook.
"We could change our outlook to negative if net refining capacity additions and increasing refinery output in Asia materially outpace growth in demand, such that our projected EBITDA for the industry declines by more than 10 percent; or if demand from China and India contracts; or if geopolitical developments materially alter operating conditions," it said.
Moody's said it would consider a positive outlook if regional demand overwhelms capacity additions such that refining margins exceed $ 8 per barrel on a sustained basis, leading to raising the EBITDA-growth forecast above 10 percent.
Apple says that it intends to bolster the U.S. manufacturing sector by creating a $1 billion “advanced manufacturing fund” — with some of that initial money going toward a company the tech giant is prepared to partner with, chief executive Tim Cook said.
The announcement, which Cook made Wednesday on CNBC, comes after months of focus by President Trump on jobs, manufacturing and the global economy. Cook did not appear to suggest that his company's decision was influenced by Trump. But the president has showered praise on companies such as Carrier, SoftBank and Charter Communications for promising to hire more American workers — even if some of those pledges predated Trump's tenure.
Unlike those firms, Apple's announcement was not a hiring promise; the company simply said that it was hoping to promote U.S. manufacturing with its new fund.
“We've talked to a company we're going to invest in already,” Cook said.
Apple intends to invest in programs that can train workers how to code, Cook added. But much of the money for this effort will be borrowed rather than drawn from its substantial cash reserves.
Cook has spoken previously about the shortage of U.S. workers who can perform advanced manufacturing. Advanced manufacturing differs from typical manufacturing in that it often requires specialized skills to produce highly engineered components that go into Apple's products.
“The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kinds of skills,” Cook told “60 Minutes” in 2015. “I mean, you can take every tool and diemaker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we're currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.”
Apple has taken some steps to highlight a commitment to U.S. jobs. In 2013, the company announced that it would begin manufacturing its high-end Mac Pro computer in Texas.
But in recent years, the Mac Pro's reputation has faltered amid complaints that the device is difficult to upgrade and poorly suited for next-generation computing. The share of Apple customers who use the Mac Pro are in the single digits, according to company executives in a recent interview with a number of Silicon Valley journalists — raising questions about the state of Apple's U.S. manufacturing presence.
An Apple spokesman declined to comment for this story. Cook said Apple would release more details about its plans for the manufacturing fund later this month.
Even as it pledges to spend big on what Trump views as a major priority, Apple and other tech companies still have billions of dollars in revenues stashed overseas. Bringing that money home would likely incur a hefty tax bill — which is why Trump has proposed slashing corporate tax rates in a way that encourages businesses to repatriate those funds.
Cook said that he's hopeful the Trump administration can succeed with that push.
Labor economists say that restoring U.S. manufacturing jobs will be difficult at a time when automation is increasingly threatening to replace many workers. Businesses may move their factories back to the United States, but because American workers are still more expensive to employ than robots, those corporate decisions may not lead to an uptick in hiring.
“The mentality is, ‘Can we increase our output first by becoming more efficient by using better technology as the first resort?' ” Augustine Tantillo, president of the National Council of Textile Organizations, told the Los Angeles Times.
Analysts predict that even highly specialized industries such as law or radiology may be shaken up by artificial intelligence. And the trend isn't just problematic for older workers; by 2030, more than a third of all U.S. jobs may be done by robots, according to a recent study by the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Donald Trump's plan to separate himself from his business empire does not go far enough and could create major ethics and even constitutional problems on the first day of his administration, experts said.
A Trump lawyer on Wednesday told reporters in New York that Trump will separate from his global business assets by putting them into a trust run by his two eldest sons and a Trump Organization executive. The company will also hire an ethics advisor to clear any new domestic deals, and Trump will donate any hotel profits generated from foreign governments to avoid the appearance of gifts.
With this structure, Trump is "walking through a minefield blindfolded" when he takes office Jan. 20, said Norman Eisen, a former top White House ethics lawyer under President Barack Obama who has led calls for Trump to divest his businesses, along with former George W. Bush lawyer Richard Painter.
"The president-elect's disregard for ethics and precedent and the Constitution in his press conference today are going to precipitate an ethics and constitutional crisis from the day he's sworn in," he told MSNBC on Wednesday.
Many ethics experts had called on Trump to divest his business or give his assets to a truly independent trustee to avoid the potential for him or his family to profit from the presidency. The U.S. Office of Government Ethics, an independent executive branch agency, previously said the involvement of Trump's children would not go far enough to reduce conflicts.
Nicole Rifkin
If Donald Trump really wants to “drain the swamp” in Washington, choosing billionaire Michigan GOP activist Betsy DeVos to be education secretary may not be such a bad idea after all; she's a political operator who has made it her life's mission to weaken public education, with a proven track record of undermining stable systems. If you want to drown government in the tub, first you need to get your assassin through the bathroom door.
For years DeVos been a high profile proponent of charter schools in her home state, and critics say Michigan's education system hasn't fared well for it, with many of the charter schools performing terribly even as they divert resources from the larger system. The only thing that has gotten more attention than her agenda is her tactics. A former head of the state Republican Party and a shrewd political operator, she's been more than willing to use her vast family fortune, estimated at $5.1 billion, to achieve her ends, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to support pro-charter politicians — or punish those who oppose her.
But shoveling money into a race — even if you're using a backhoe — is of limited value. The effects may not last past the next election cycle. So for decades, DeVos and her family foundation have pursued far wider-reaching and longer-lasting changes by helping systematically weaken the barriers that keep money from flooding American politics. And they've been very successful.
“I view Betsy DeVos as waging a decades-long war on democracy and campaign finance reform,” says Paul S. Ryan, vice president for policy and litigation at the nonprofit Common Cause. With the help of her family's bankroll, DeVos has supported a handful of organizations that have slowly but effectively chipped away at the campaign finance regulation system, opening elections up ever more to moneyed interests just like her.
That support helped lead to the infamous Citizens United ruling, which bulldozed the last of the dams keeping corporate cash out of elections. “In a very real sense,” says Ryan, “it's fair to refer to Betsy DeVos as the godmother of the Citizens United decision.”
How DeVos came to contribute, at least indirectly, to one of the most destructive Supreme Court rulings in a generation takes a little unpacking. The story begins with a lawyer named Jim Bopp, a soft-spoken, genial Midwesterner who has probably done more to unravel campaign finance law than any other individual in America.

It was Bopp who initiated the Citizens United case, which upended the campaign finance landscape in 2010, eliminating most limits on corporate giving, after a group of politically motivated filmmakers sued for the right to distribute a feature-length attack ad on Hillary Clinton. He's litigated hundreds of other cases at all levels of government, including landmark rulings like McCutcheon v. FEC and FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, which Paul describes as a “precursor” to Citizens United. (The Wisconsin decision likewise dealt with corporate campaign spending, loosening rules on when it can be prohibited; Citizens United essentially obliterated them.) Taken together, the cases Bopp devised have gone a long way toward dismantling the spending limits established under the landmark McCain-Feingold legislation of 2002.
Much of Bopp's litigation stems from a nonprofit that he effectively controls called the James Madison Center for Free Speech. The organization seeks out and pursues a slew of potential test cases in far-flung parts of the country, cases that turn on minute points of campaign finance law and, Bopp hopes, will serve as a basis to invalidate the last vestiges of the campaign finance regulation system. And though the Madison Center be but little — revenues rarely exceed $100,000 per year — it is fierce, and has played an important role in Bopp's strategy over the years. In fact, it's hard to separate the center from Bopp's firm at all; the two entities share an address and phone number, and almost all of the center's revenue flows to Bopp's firm, which means that the center, for all intents and purposes, underwrites his activities.
From at least 2002 — the earliest year for which tax records are available — to 2013, DeVos served as a member of the Madison Center's governing board, records show. Her family charity, the Dick and Betsy DeVos Foundation, has also provided at least $70,000 to the organization over the years. (Her support has found its way to other groups with similar priorities, such as the Center for Competitive Politics and the Institute for Justice.) In 2002, the foundation's grant of $35,000 amounted to about 17 percent of the Madison Center's operating budget. Bopp declined to comment for this story, and questions directed to DeVos through representatives were not returned.
Bopp is a true believer, and his view of campaign spending is rigorously consistent, if less than compelling to progressive ears. Money is speech; speech cannot be limited; therefore, money cannot be limited. He views campaign spending caps and other forms of regulation not as a way to stave off corruption, but as a noxious curtailment of the First Amendment.
DeVos seems to share his contempt for campaign finance laws. When her political action committee All Children Matter ran afoul of Ohio campaign regulations in 2008, drawing a record $5.3 million fine, she simply shuttered the organization. The fine is still outstanding, and as her confirmation hearing looms this week, some Democratic senators are calling on her to pay it off before she can be considered.
It seems unlikely that she will have a change of heart, however. In a 1997 op-ed, DeVos was transparent about her view of money in politics. As reprinted by the Center for Public Integrity, DeVos wrote, “My family is the largest single contributor of soft money to the national Republican Party…I have decided, however, to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence. Now, I simply concede the point.”
Beautiful Jim Key was a famous performing horse around the turn of the twentieth century.[1] His promoters claimed that the horse could read and write, make change with money, do arithmetic for "numbers below thirty," and cite Bible passages "where the horse is mentioned."[2]
William Key
Beautiful Jim's trainer, "Dr." William Key, was a former slave, a self-trained veterinarian, and a patent medicine salesman.[3] Key emphasized that he used only patience and kindness in teaching the horse, and never a whip.[4] Beautiful Jim became a celebrity thanks to the progressive promotion of A. R. Rogers. The horse performed at large venues from Atlantic City to Chicago.[5]
Tours [ edit ]
Beautiful Jim Key and his trainer periodically toured the United States in a special railroad car to promote the fledgling cause of the humane treatment of animals. They performed in the best venues in most of the larger American cities, including New York's Madison Square Garden. The horse was among the most popular attractions at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Beautiful Jim Key was supposedly so smart that he could do math, maybe even trigonometry, in his head. .
President William McKinley saw Beautiful Jim Key perform at an exposition in Tennessee and declared, “This is the most astonishing and entertaining exhibition I have ever witnessed.” The President also commented that it was an example of what “kindness and patience” could accomplish.[6]
Cruelty to Animals [ edit ]
The horse was made an honorary member of George Thorndike Angell's American Humane Association.[7] He also got 2 million kids to gather to pledge never be mean to animals. Also, every animal he met he befriended them and tamed them.

“So here's what I say to all of you Never Trumpers — Glenn Beck, I hope you're listening. You own Hillary Clinton's Supreme Court appointments. You own it! You are doing everything you can do to cast doubt in people's minds!”
He continued:
“Arrogant, stubborn, lying about what Trump has said and his record. Purposefully distorting, creating doubt, misperception––and you're so obsessed… with Trump, you don't even go over how corrupt Hillary is…”
“And you are going to say, ‘Hannity, we blame you. You gave Donald Trump time on your show.' And I gave every other candidate time. His agenda is infinitely better than hers. And if you can't see that, then that's your problem. You own it. You own her. You own every dumb thing she's about to do. I blame you. Got it? I am going to name names regularly if she wins.”

"I think all Americans should be concerned. It's clear that is running a very cynical campaign pitting groups of Americans against one another," Clinton said ahead of tomorrow's primaries.
"He is trafficking in hate and fear. He is playing to our worst instincts rather than our angels of our better nature," the former secretary of state said in response to a question.
Clinton, 68, said Trump, 69, incites violence in his audience.
"He actually incites violence in the way that he urges his audience on, you know, now talking about punching people, offering to pay legal bills, and then on the specifics, you know, we know that he has been incredibly bigoted toward so many groups, he talks about deporting eleven, twelve million immigrants-we're a nation built on immigrants-he talks about preventing Muslims from coming into our country-we believe in religious freedom," she said.
"There's just so much of what he's doing that I think we all have to reject. Because it is so at odds with our values. You don't make America great by tearing down everything that made America great and so let's stand up and with one voice and reject that," Clinton said.
The Republican and Democratic parties have intensified their campaigning ahead of the Tuesday's primaries in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio.
In response to another question, Clinton claimed foreign leaders are ready to endorse her to stop Trump.
"I am already receiving messages from leaders. I'm having foreign leaders ask if they can endorse me to stop Donald Trump," she said.
She did not name any foreign leaders, but did say the Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has endorsed her publicly.
Clinton said she didn't want to "spill the beans right now, but suffice it to say, there are many arguments that we can use against him."
"But one argument that I am uniquely qualified to bring, because of my service as secretary of State, is what [Trump's] presidency would mean to our country and our standing in the world," she said.
Earlier Clinton's sole Democratic presidential rival Bernie Sanders called Trump a pathological liar.

At least one of the eleven men that died in the initial explosion that triggered a disaster in the Gulf expressed concerns about safety practices on the oil rig. Transocean toolpusher Jason Anderson told his wife, Shelly, that he was concerned about BP's safety practices on the rig. Anderson was so worried about an accident that he spent his last trip home getting his affairs in order.
"Everything seemed to be pressing to Jason about getting things in order. In case something happened. Teaching me how to do certain things on the motor home so that I could go and do things with the kids, make sure that I knew how to do everything," an emotional Shelly Anderson told NBC's Lisa Myers.
Her husband drew up a will and talked about his hopes for their daughter and son.The last few times Jason called her from the rig he was was clearly worried.
"They were getting pressure from someplace higher up to do things that maybe weren't exactly the way Jason thought that they should be," she said. "It was a safety issue."
"Jason's father told us Jason was concerned that BP, which controlled the rig, kept wanting to stray from procedures to finish the well faster, which Jason considered unsafe," Myers reported.

BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota law enforcement purchased more than $600,000 worth of body armor, tactical equipment and crowd control devices during the height of protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline, state invoices show.
The purchases, tallied by The Associated Press from invoices obtained through a public records request, included pepper spray, flash-bang and smoke grenades, riot helmets, gas masks, night-vision goggles, more than 2,000 rounds of non-lethal ammunition and more.
The equipment ultimately made up a small share of the $35 million in policing costs associated with the pipeline, and state officials defend the purchases as reasonable for a protest that attracted thousands of “water protectors” to southern North Dakota who skirmished — sometimes violently — with law enforcement.
“There was a legitimate, deliberate plan that was put together that said, ‘OK, how can we do this and do it safe for folks on both sides?'” state Homeland Security Director Greg Wilz said. “At the end of the day we were successful.”
Most of the purchases were in September, October and November of last year, when confrontations near a protest encampment grew most heated. Authorities established their own operations center a short distance away and manned it for months, making 761 arrests. About 75 officers were deployed on a typical day, though the number jumped to as many as 540 during one skirmish.
Invoices show Minneapolis-based police equipment company Streicher's was paid nearly $613,000 for gear.
Protesters who have filed an excessive force lawsuit say police became “militarized” by October of last year and point to the use of such equipment, including tear gas, rubber bullets and concussion grenades. They allege a wide range of injuries, including burns, broken bones, eye injuries, and wounds requiring stitches and staples. Among those injured was Sophia Wilansky, a 21-year-old New York woman who underwent several surgeries for a serious arm injury. Protesters maintain she was injured by a grenade thrown by police, while authorities say she was hurt by a small propane tank that protesters rigged to explode.
“Having police officers show up looking like Stormtroopers, seems in many ways only exacerbated clashes that did occur,” said Lauren Regan, founder and executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center, which is part of the lawsuit. “When police officers anonymize themselves, when they put on all that Rambo gear and face shields and no one can identify them, it tends to incite that mob mentality.”
Police say officers were subjected to thrown objects and in one instance gunshots, though they did not report any serious injuries.
Two experts on policing — Michigan State University Intelligence Program Director David Carter and John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor Eugene O'Donnell — both said the purchases seemed reasonable.
″(Police) may not have the ready availability of massive numbers of people and resources, so there may be more of a need to go over the top in being ready just because of the geographical factor,” O'Donnell said.
Wilz, the state homeland security director, said North Dakota found no model for responding to such a large protest in a rural area, received no help from federal law agencies and basically came up with its own plan.
Authorities feared guns were in the protest camp based on social media postings, and area stores had alerted police that protesters were buying products such as wasp spray to use against officers, he said.
“That's why the helmets and the shields and the protection came out,” he said. The heavily armed police force “did look like an escalation,” he acknowledged, “but largely it was there to protect the officers who were trying to protect the general public on all sides of this issue.”
The equipment wasn't shared with private pipeline security in the protest area, Wilz said. All of it has been stored at state facilities for future use, he said.
The state also spent $12,350 on a subscription to Geofeedia, which collects, maps and stores information from social media posts. Police around the U.S. have used it to aid surveillance during protests, but it has drawn criticism from civil liberties groups. Facebook, Instagram and Twitter all have restricted access to Geofeedia in the past year under pressure from the American Civil Liberties Union.
Bills for protest-related expenses are still coming in. Much of the $35 million went to payroll, but restaurants, hotels and supply businesses in the Bismarck area received millions for services and product sales.
All of the spending will be audited by the state at some point, according to Secretary of State Al Jaeger and state Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ray Holmberg, two members of the state's Emergency Commission, which approved borrowing money to cover the protest policing costs.
At least $10 million of the expense is being funded by taxpayers. Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners has given North Dakota $15 million to help with the bills. The state also has received a $10 million grant from the U.S. Justice Department for the same purpose.

An investment in the club to be involved in its initiatives and in exchange for benefits, and exclusive rewards. This is the new proposal that Atalanta highlighted in a dedicated area of its portal www.atalanta.it.
After having performed a record season that ended up with a historic qualification to the Europa League, Atalanta recently launched this innovative crowdfunding idea.
Through its official website, Atalanta published a poll to check the willingness of fans interested in helping the club to develop its strategies and reach forecasted objectives.
Fans are asked to express their thoughts in reference to the development of innovative facilities for the sake of both the team and the fans, the projects linked to the Atleti Azzurri stadium, a medical center (for the club, fans and the whole community of Bergamo), investments in the Zingonia Sports Center, various experiences for the community (Fanzone, Wifi at the stadium) and the Nerazzurri museum, which should be built inside the facility recently purchased and ready to be restored.
Those willing to provide their economic contribution will enjoy several benefits such as:
Image copyright Roskomnadzor Image caption At the moment, monitors search websites individually to weed out profanities
A computer programme to seek out swear words on the internet should go live in the autumn, to enforce a Russian law against online obscenity, it's been reported.
Already, Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor employs monitors to scan about 5,000 websites for obscene terms by hand, under a law passed last year that fines and seizes equipment from violators, the Izvestia newspaper reports.
The country's Academy of Science says the law applies to "obscene references to the male and female reproductive organs, copulation and women of loose morals, and all words derived from them" - a genre in which Russian vocabulary is particularly rich.
One commenter notes that expletives are part of everyday speech. "If they ban swearing in Russia, all technical progress will grind to a halt," he says. "Warehouses will close and the army will lose its combat readiness. For our Motherland, it will be the end," he adds, deploying a euphemism that sails close to the official guidelines.
Another law to root out swearing in feature films provoked much online mockery last month, with critics saying the measure amounts to backdoor political censorship. With the arrival of the "swearbot" program some analysts say bloggers might be at risk, especially as a law that defines major blogs as mass media is speeding towards approval.

Lee Berthiaume, The Canadian Press
OTTAWA -- The long road to replacing Canada's aging fighter jets took a surprising turn Tuesday as the federal Liberal government added a caveat to its latest battle of the bidders: contenders deemed to be harming the country's economic interests will find themselves at a "distinct disadvantage."
The plan is to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force's current fleet of CF-18 with 88 sleek, modern new planes, Procurement Minister Carla Qualtrough and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan told a news conference -- a contract worth between $15 billion and $19 billion.
But the economic-interests test, still in the development stages with the help of the aerospace industry, was an unexpected twist that appears to have raised as many questions as answers.
The government also confirmed Tuesday that it is walking away from plans to buy 18 Super Hornets from U.S. aerospace firm Boeing amid a bitter trade dispute with Montreal-based rival Bombardier. Canada will instead buy 18 second-hand F-18s from Australia to deal with what the Liberals call a critical shortage of jets until the entire fleet can be replaced.
While the full cost and delivery schedule are still being ironed out, the move will ultimately save time and money, Sajjan insisted.
The deal must still be approved by the U.S. government, which originally sold the F-18s to Australia and retains control over the transfer of such arms.
During question period Tuesday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer blasted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's plan to buy old, second-hand aircraft that are of a similar vintage to the planes the government is replacing.
"If the prime minister is so keen on buying fixer-uppers, will he come over?" Scheer quipped. "I have an old minivan I would love to show him."
But it was the Conservatives themselves who made a hash of the fighter-jet file and created the need for an interim fleet, Trudeau retorted.
Gen. Jonathan Vance, Canada's chief of the defence staff, was also on the dais at Tuesday's news conference alongside Qualtrough, Sajjan, Transport Minister Marc Garneau and Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains. The Australian aircraft are safe and will meet Canada's needs, he insisted.
"Make no mistake, these aircraft will work fine and those aircraft are very much needed," Vance said.
The decision to walk away from the interim Super Hornets -- which carried an estimated price tag of $6 billion -- was hardly a surprise, considering the government's recent anti-Boeing rhetoric. But it remains to be seen how Boeing will be impacted by the economic-interest test, since the Chicago-based aerospace giant has major operations in Canada.
Boeing has already made it clear it's eager to enter the Super Hornet into the competition, despite its chilly relations with Ottawa over Bombardier. Qualtrough said the competition would be transparent and open to all, and that the new test will apply to all major military purchases in future.
But the ministers didn't dispute the notion that Boeing could be already at a disadvantage.
"The purpose of this new policy is to clearly demonstrate that anyone that wants to engage Canada, if they cause economic harm, will be at a distinct disadvantage," said Bains.
"That's the objective. This is really about our national interest. Our economy. And good-quality jobs in Canada."
Boeing will review the government's announcement, including the new economic-harm test, before deciding on next steps, company spokesman Scott Day said in an email.
At the same time, Day noted that Boeing employs 2,000 Canadians, including many in Winnipeg, conducts business with 560 local companies, and contributes $4 billion to the economy each year.
"If you look at Boeing's record in Canada, I think you have to let our record speak for itself."
That touches on one of the main questions with the new test, said defence analyst David Perry of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute: how the test is applied to companies like Boeing, which already have large interests in Canada.
"That will be fascinating to see because there will be an extraordinary amount of subjectivity in that," Perry said.
"They have the trade action and complaint against Bombardier. But they also do billions of dollars of economic activity in Canada every year. How do you weigh those two things?
"I think that will be extraordinarily difficult."
IBM has completed its latest blockchain project with French bank Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, an effort that found the two firms using the technology to create a system for identity verification.
The companies said the proof-of-concept uses the Hyperledger blockchain fabric to enable customers to provide proof of identity to third parties, such as local utilities and retailers. IBM and Crédit Mutuel further sought to label the proof-of-concept as one that provides evidence of how blockchain is being applied in non-financial applications.
In statements, Crédit Mutuel COO of innovation and operations Frédéric Laurent said:
“This project offered a complete view of customers' documents across our distributed network and helped us to understand and master blockchain for other client uses.”
Going forward, Laurent said that the bank is now ready to “incorporate” the technology into its ecosystem, though it did not provide more details on how it may move forward on this objective.
The announcement comes as France-based financial institutions become more active in their explorations of the technology despite the more negative views of some prominent politicians.
Last week, BNP Paribas and Caisse des Dépôts, for example, were among several French and European financial institutions to reveal they are working on a post-trade blockchain platform aimed at small businesses.
Further, the news comes as IBM has become increasingly active in showcasing work completed with its clients as part of its blockchain services offerings, first revealed in February. Earlier this week, IBM opened its latest workshopping space aimed at supporting the technology in New York City.

A Texas high school anatomy teacher has been arrested for allegedly having an improper relationship with a student.
The Lockhart Police Department said 27-year-old Sarah Fowlkes of Lockhart High School "engaged in sexual contact" with a 17-year-old male student earlier this month.
Police told NBC Austin affiliate KXAN Fowlkes turned herself in on Monday and bonded out later that day.
Fowlkes' attorney Jason Nassour said, "You've got a young lady who was arrested on the statement of a 17-year-old kid with no corroborating evidence."
Nassour said his client is smiling in her mug shot because she is innocent.
He added that "this isn't a guilty person sitting there like they just got caught. When everything's fleshed out it won't be as it appears."

The head of the Detroit FBI sought to reassure metro Detroit's Arab-American and Muslim communities Wednesday in the wake of a report that the agency flew a spy plane over Dearborn.
Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Detroit office Paul Abbate met with Arab-American leaders in Dearborn at the office of the Arab-American News along with U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Dearborn) and Dearborn City Councilman Mike Sareini.
Several Arab-American groups released statements denouncing fly-overs.
Osama Siblani, publisher of the Arab American News, said some local residents are "very nervous about the FBI, ICE, everybody related to the government. They've been harassed at borders, harassed at airports, harassed at home. They've been told over and over that they are a terrorist, and they are treated as such."
But the FBI released a statement saying the agency does not target any group or region because of their ethnic or religious background. Abbate said that the FBI routinely uses airplanes for specific surveillance and does not conduct mass surveillance.
"We do not target specific communities," Abbate said. He added that the FBI is "not aware of any specific or credible threat to the Detroit metropolitan area."
Abbate did not comment on records that show a small plane circling around Dearborn over the weekend.
A 2010 single-engine Cessna, registration number N102BR, can be seen on flightradar24.com on Saturday from roughly 7:30 pm. to 9 p.m., taking a flight path from the Harrison Township area then across Wayne County to southwest Dearborn, where it circles about 19 times before turning north.
A similar flight is taken Sunday evening, over an area including the Henry Ford Museum, Fairlane Green shopping center and a number of surrounding neighborhoods.
The area of Dearborn that the plane circled over includes a mosque, the American Moslem Center, but is not as heavily populated by Muslims as is the eastern section of Dearborn.
The plane is registered to OTV Leasing of Bristow, Va., records show. The Associated Press reported last spring that dozens of airplanes associated with the FBI were using fake companies with post-office boxes in Bristow, about an hour's drive from FBI headquarters. The AP investigation listed OTV Leasing among at least 13 fake companies used by the FBI, the Detroit News reports.
More than 40% of Dearborn's population has roots in the Middle East, the highest concentration among all cities in the U.S. Most of them are Muslim. A year ago, Arab-American groups expressed concern when a report compiled by the National Counterterrorism Center listed the city as second only to New York City among communities with the highest number of terrorists, or those tied to terrorists.
The FBI Detroit office issued a statement today:
"Contrary to the suggestion of some recent media reporting, the FBI does not employ aviation assets to conduct mass surveillance nor to target specific communities. Neither does the FBI monitor lawfully protected First Amendment activity. Further, the FBI Detroit Field Office is not aware of any specific or credible threats within the local Detroit metropolitan area," said the statement.
Abbate told the Free Press that "it's no secret" that the FBI uses airplanes sometimes.
The statement explained: "As stated in the June 4th, 2015 release from the FBI National Press Office, the FBI routinely uses aviation assets in support of lawful, predicated investigations targeting specific individuals and, when requested and appropriate, in support of state and local law enforcement.
"The use of aviation assets is strictly regulated and governed through rigorous oversight by DOJ and in full compliance with the Attorney General Guidelines and the FBI's Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide. The FAA is fully aware and supportive of this practice."
Dr. Muzammil Ahmed, chair of the Michigan Muslim Community Council, said the best security comes from citizens working with law enforcement, rather than law enforcement working unilaterally.
"We were a little bit surprised" to hear of the flyovers, he said. "I'd like to reserve judgment until we get further details of what transpired."
The Arab American Civil Rights League in Dearborn called for an investigation into the airplane over Dearborn. Its chairman, Nabih Ayad, said: "The right to privacy is a fundamental American value enshrined in the Constitution and protected by the Bill of Rights...While we absolutely acknowledge the great work that the FBI does in protecting us every day, we also expect the FBI to lead by example in protecting our privacy from unreasonable searches. We can work together as Americans to seek that balance between personal privacy and security."
The Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said it was concerned and intended to file a complaint. The Michigan chapter of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee also expressed alarm, saying in a statement: "The use of government aircraft to conduct profiling of a religious or ethnic community without probable cause is unconstitutional and harmful to the entire Dearborn community."
Other Arab-Americans in Dearborn didn't mind the airplane.
"I'm all for any governmental activities that will make us safer," said Majed Moughni, a Dearborn attorney. "If spying will lead to an arrest, so be it. We are law abiding citizens who have nothing to hide."

Marijuana legalization activists on Thursday successfully brought weed into the Capitol Hill office of Senator Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican, in an attempt to have the nation's next attorney general abandon his anti-pot stance.
At least two of the more than 20 activists who made their way into Mr. Session's Russell Building office Thursday afternoon managed to sneak the contraband past a U.S. Capitol Police security checkpoint, according to U.S. News & World Report.
Once inside the senator's office, one activist blatantly rolled a joint while others engaged in a conversation with Mr. Session's communications director, Chris Jackson, regarding the medical use of marijuana and their concerns over the continued federal prohibition of pot, U.S. News reported.
Mr. Jackson was offered weed by the activists but declined, the report said.
While marijuana has been mostly decriminalized in the nation's capital since 2015, the activists who smuggled pot into Mr. Session's office risked arrest on account of having brought the substance into a federal building.
Despite marijuana being legalized for recreational and medicinal purposes by a growing number of states each year, the U.S. Justice Department still considers the plant to be a Schedule 1 drug with no proven health benefits. President Barack Obama's administration has largely decided against intervening in states that have passed marijuana laws of their own in recent years, but activists uncertain about his successor's plans have called on Mr. Sessions to promise he won't change course under the incoming presidential administration.
Mr. Trump last month announced Mr. Sessions as his pick to lead the Department of Justice, alarming legal marijuana advocates who took notice earlier this year when the adamantly anti-pot lawmaker testified that “Good people don't smoke marijuana.”
“We need grownups in charge in Washington saying marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized, it ought to be minimized, that it is in fact a very real danger,” Mr. Sessions said during a Senate hearing in April.
Thursday's coordinated demonstration marked the second time in as many weeks that activists have visited Mr. Session's office on Capitol Hill in hopes of better understanding how he plans to enforce federal drug laws as attorney general under Donald Trump.
“If you're not going to arrest people in your own office who bring marijuana… why would you break down people's doors as a federal policy?” D.C. Cannabis Campaign organizer Adam Eidinger asked during Thursday's demonstration, U.S. News reported.
Mr. Eidinger and other pro-weed advocates previously said the planed to host a series of “Smoke Sessions” prior to Mr. Trump taking the oath of office, and plan to protest Mr. Session's confirmation hearing next month as well as the president-elect's inauguration.
“We can't idly sit by and watch all the hard work we've done to legalize cannabis in D.C. be eroded by an out of touch prohibitionist!” the organizers wrote on their website.

The Chinese Navy has faced a serious problem with feeding its crews on long voyages. This is because traditional Chinese food is time consuming to prepare and uses more water than Western chow. You can cut corners and provide simple (and unappetizing) meals on short training voyages and get away with it. That does not require much manpower or lots of water but does little for morale. The officers usually get fed better but the sailors expect that.
On longer voyages quality food is an important element in maintaining morale for the entire crew. This was discovered over the last four years as China sent 13 Task Forces (3-4 ships each) over 4,000 kilometers to Somalia for anti-piracy duty. These ships were away for six months or more and the navy was forced to innovate to keep the food appealing. The solution turned out to be more Western style food. This worked mainly because most of the sailors were young and keen to try Western food. This stuff is still relatively expensive (but very popular) in China, if only because a lot of it relies a lot on meat (burgers and chicken). Chinese officers had studied food service in Western navies and noted that the Western navies were able to use more equipment and automation as well as pre-packaged items to greatly reduce the manpower (and fresh water) needed to prepare attractive and nutritious meals.
All this was seen on the new Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning, which has a crew of 2,500 and is expected to go on training cruises lasting a week or more. Operating a carrier, especially one conducting a lot of takeoffs and landings, is very stressful for the crew. So burgers, fried chicken, and reheated frozen Chinese dishes are served. This is expensive but it maintains morale and the ability to keep the busy schedule going. The Chinese Army has also been forced to use pre-packaged foods (like Western MREs) for combat operations where time consuming food preparation was not practical. Of course the Chinese have long (for thousands of years) used rice balls for emergency rations. The new prosperity in China has led to entrepreneurs developing traditional Chinese dishes in storable form. This has provided the armed forces with a constant supply of new ideas on how to keep the troops supplied with satisfactory food while on the move.
Lego said the runaway success of a range of £2 lucky dip figurines aimed at those with pocket money to burn had provided the building blocks for a record year for the Danish toymaker.
With a cast of characters that includes an Egyptian queen and an evil dwarf, "Minifigures" have taken UK playgrounds by storm, helping the brand to report growth of more than 10% in the UK for the six months to 30 June.
Drew Brazer, UK managing director, said the inexpensive Minifigures were "accessible" toys for children to collect. Long-running sets such as Lego Star Wars and City were continuing to sell well but Ninjago, a new franchise launched in January that pitches Lego ninjas against skeletons, had also been a hit, he said.
Group sales at the family-owned toymaker were 25% higher at 7.3bn kroner (£876m), while profits were also up at DK1.9bn. The Billund-based company said that it now had 7% of the global toy market compared with 5.9% at the end of last year. The company, which was started in 1931, has performed well despite the downturn as parents stuck to tried and tested toys to entertain their children.
Brazer said Lego had not been as affected as rivals by rising manufacturing costs in the far east as it produces less in the region. The company makes the majority of its products in its native Denmark as well as the Czech Republic, Hungary and Mexico.
Lego's chief executive, Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, said that the group saw "double-digit" growth in all 130 markets barring Japan, where the tsunami and earthquake caused disruption. "The first six months of the year have exceeded our expectations on all markets, and the financial result is very satisfactory," he said, adding: "But as the bulk of our sales occur in the closing months of the year, it is too early yet to say anything definite about the overall result for 2011."
Lego also said it was shaking up its management structure. The reorganisation will see a number of senior executives including Christian Iversen, executive vice-president, leave the business in the autumn. Vig Knudstorp said the changes would "make it simpler" and provide a platform for future growth.

Premier Kathleen Wynne says it's time to loosen Ontario's liquor laws in order to get more locally produced beverages into the hands of consumers, and she's keen on starting with Ontario wines.
“I think having some sort of controlled availability is what we need to look at, absolutely,” she said.
Decades of strict government control in Ontario limit winemakers, which is why many have been urging Queen's Park to allow privately run VQA stores that would sell mostly Ontario vintages.
In a one-on-one interview with CTV Toronto's Paul Bliss, Wynne said she is ready to relax the law for more points of sale of Ontario wines.
Wynne will not push to put booze in corner stores, but she said change is coming.
Winery owner Jeff Aubry is skeptical over the premier's promise, however.
“I'm happy to hear it, but I've heard it before,” he said.
Aubry says the current laws limit his ability to sell all of his stock, which is produced at Coyote's Run Estate Winery in Niagara-on-the-Lake.
He can only sell at his winery, to restaurants and the LCBO, which takes 75 per cent of his bounty.
“They're our customer, and they're a good customer, but they're the only one,” he told CTV Toronto. “If they don't take a wine, then I have to drink it.”
Aubry said he'll produce 120,000 cases of wine when the harvest begins this week. Of that, the LCBO will purchase about 80,000, leaving him to find a way to sell 40,000 cases.
Hillary Dawson, president of the Wine Council of Ontario, says the province's wine industry is on the brink of expansion. She believes consumers now embrace local wines that used to be dismissed as insufficient.
“Let's give them another place to grow their business and I think you'll see our industry explode,” she said.
Aubry says Ontarians don't realize how many restrictions the government imposes.
“They think what we have here is normal – it's not,” he said. “It's actually one of the most repressive alcohol distribution regimes in the Western world.”

Roberto Martinez was the right man for the job
David Moyes was a tough act to follow - but Roberto Martinez's debut campaign with the Blues exceeded expectations.
The Catalan is his own man, different in many respects to Moyes. He has won over Blues fans with stylish, attacking football, a willingness to put his faith in young talent and a friendly, approachable demeanor, something which also endears him to his players.
It also earned him the respect of Liverpool supporters when he spoke to movingly and eloquently at this year's Hillsborough Memorial Service.
On the pitch, the Martinez era got off to a slow start. The Blues were unbeaten but unimpressive in their first three Premier League games, drawing with Norwich City, West Brom and Cardiff City.
Everything changed in the frantic final hours and minutes of the transfer window, when Martinez chairman Bill Kenwright did brilliant business. The Blues bagged £27.5m from the sale of Marouane Fellaini to Moyes' Manchester United and also pocketed £5m from West Brom for Victor Anichebe. Their loss was offset with the signing of James McCarthy from Wigan in a deal rising to £14m, and the loan captures of Gareth Barry and Romelu Lukaku.
It proved to be a masterstroke. Barry and McCarthy made their debuts in the 1-0 win over Chelsea. Blues fans had to wait an extra week to see Lukaku, who came off the bench to head a thrilling late debut winner at West Ham.
Everton would go on to amass a club record Premier League points haul, surpassing their previous best of 65 (set in 2008) by mid-April, as they chased a top-four finish.
The Moyes-Martinez transition could have been a difficult one.
It has turned out to be anything but for Everton. For Moyes at Old Trafford, it was a different story altogether.
School of Science is back
“Roberto had a dream, to build our football team,” is the first line of a new chant aired by Blues fans this season. We all know how it ends - by concluding that the School of Science philosophy, separated from Everton for so long, is back.
As the banners and the songs confirm, Martinez has been responsible for the return of some traditional Everton values this season. “Trying to keep the ball in a more technical manner,” is how the boss describes it and the stats tell their own story.
Under Moyes last season, the Blues averaged 416 accurate passes per game. At times in 2013-14, the figure has hit the 580 mark.
The football produced under Martinez has been stylish, incisive, inventive and, more often than not, attacking.
Systems have changed from week to week, with full-backs pushed on, forwards exchanging positions, strikers playing on the wing and false nines deployed through the middle. Forwards have been rotated to keep them fresh, often switching positions during a game. Rival managers have been kept guessing as much as the fans and media.
It has not always worked out - Martinez was unable to find the winning formula for crucial contests against Crystal Palace and Southampton - but has also seen the Blues claim some big scalps, from Manchester United (twice) to Chelsea and Arsenal.
The School of Science term has been associated with the Blues since the 1920s, but really took hold in the 60s when the Holy Trinity of Kendall, Ball and Harvey were in their prime. It was lost for a while, returning during the glory years of the 1980s.
It is back again - and will surely stay for as long as Martinez reigns.
The future's bright
Martinez has hailed the emergence of John Stones and Ross Barkley as Everton's “success story” of the season - and the fans have enjoyed seeing the young pair get so much game-time in royal blue.
The Everton manager has not been afraid to put his trust in his squad's younger players.
At the club's recent general meeting, Martinez proudly pointed out how a total of 14,499 minutes had been amassed by players aged 24 and under during his tenure - a leap of more than 10,000 compared to the 2012-13 campaign.
"When you've got a strong way of playing you rely on your young player to give you something, and that's been very significant," Martinez told shareholders. "You can imagine - in terms of the bravery, the talent and the long-term vision that we have at the club - how important that is.”
Barkley, 20, played just 206 minutes in an Everton shirt under Moyes last season. This season he clocked up more than 2,300 minutes, scoring six goals in 25 Premier League starts - including phenomenal strikes against Newcastle and Manchester City. The flair and verve with which he plays fits the Martinez blueprint perfectly.
The same applies to Stones, a player signed by Moyes but blooded by Martinez. The defender nailed down a regular place in the side when Phil Jagielka was ruled out by injury and has displayed maturity beyond his 19 years. Despite only recently making his 20th senior appearance for the club, calls for Stones to be included in England's World Cup squad were growing louder as the end of the season approached.
Barkley and Stones were not the only young guns to impress this season. Loan stars Lukaku, 20, and Gerard Deulofeu, 20, have honed their skills at Goodison, while homegrown players like Luke Garbutt, Ryan Ledson and Tyias Browning have made the bench in recent weeks.
Those outside of the first-team picture - the likes of Matthew Pennington, John Lundstram and Matthew Kennedy - were loaned out to gain experience in the rough-and-tumble world of the Football League.
This summer is crucial - Martinez's biggest test yet
Having enjoyed such a positive debut season, securing European football for the first time since 2009-10, the challenge now for Martinez is to build on his achievements.
The summer will be pivotal as the Blues boss must assemble a squad capable of being competitive on both the domestic and European fronts. Some moves will need to be made before the World Cup, others will likely be triggered by the emergence of players in Brazil.
“It's not about improving the squad, it's about increasing it,” said Martinez. "When you are playing in Europe you need six or seven new players. That's the reality and we will do that. I get excited about bringing new players in. You need fresh blood.”
Backing from the board will be required, as will Martinez's ability to make the most of his resources. He snapped up three players on season-long loans last summer and, between them, they made more than 80 Premier League appearances and contributed 20 goals. Barry, Lukaku and Deulofeu must be retained, replaced or signed on a permanent basis.
Everton's squad will need to expand to handle the demands of Europa League football - the relentless group games, long-distance Thursday away trips - and Martinez's biggest task will be to ensure there is no negative impact on Premier League form.
As he has proved this season, the Blues are in safe hands.

Results There was no evidence that participants offered the physical activity intervention reported improvement in mood by the four month follow-up point compared with those in the usual care group; adjusted between group difference in mean Beck depression inventory score −0.54 (95% confidence interval −3.06 to 1.99; P=0.68). Similarly, there was no evidence that the intervention group reported a change in mood by the eight and 12 month follow-up points. Nor was there evidence that the intervention reduced antidepressant use compared with usual care (adjusted odds ratio 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 2.06; P=0.44) over the duration of the trial. However, participants allocated to the intervention group reported more physical activity during the follow-up period than those allocated to the usual care group (adjusted odds ratio 2.27, 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 3.89; P=0.003).
Main outcome measures The primary outcome was self reported symptoms of depression, assessed with the Beck depression inventory at four months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes included use of antidepressants and physical activity at the four, eight, and 12 month follow-up points, and symptoms of depression at eight and 12 month follow-up.
Interventions In addition to usual care, intervention participants were offered up to three face to face sessions and 10 telephone calls with a trained physical activity facilitator over eight months. The intervention was based on theory and aimed to provide individually tailored support and encouragement to engage in physical activity.
Participants 361 adults aged 18-69 who had recently consulted their general practitioner with symptoms of depression. All those randomised had a diagnosis of an episode of depression as assessed by the clinical interview schedule-revised and a Beck depression inventory score of 14 or more.
A Cochrane review 3 of physical activity interventions and depression suggested a pooled standardised mean difference of 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.51 to 1.12), based on 23 trials and 907 participants. This evidence on the effectiveness of physical activity should be considered with caution, however, owing to several methodological issues. Many of the included trials were small, with even the largest reporting fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm. The majority of trials recruited participants from non-clinical settings, often offering financial or other incentives to those who agreed to participate. Most studies involved relatively short follow-up periods so that evidence for a more sustained benefit is limited, and, finally, few of the interventions designed to increase physical activity were readily applicable to clinical practice. It is therefore difficult to be confident about generalising the pooled results of the meta-analysis 3 to the population with depression treated by doctors in primary care.
Depression is one of the most common reasons for consulting a general practitioner within the United Kingdom, and its associated economic burden is considerable. 1 Although antidepressants are effective, many patients and healthcare professionals would like other options to be available as an alternative or adjunct to drug therapy. 2 Some evidence 3 shows that physical activity might be an effective treatment and it has been recommended as part of the latest guidelines on depression from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. 4
Methods
The TREAD study was a pragmatic, multicentre, two arms parallel randomised controlled trial. Adults presenting with a new episode of depression were randomised to receive either usual care from their general practitioner or usual care plus the TREAD intervention. Full details of the protocol have been published previously5 and the results are available in the final report of the trial.6
Recruitment of participants and baseline assessment Our inclusion criteria were broad as we wanted to recruit adults presenting in primary care with new episodes of depression. However, we excluded those who had failed to respond previously to antidepressants as this group often requires more intensive interventions. We also excluded those aged 70 or more as we thought this older group might have greater physical health problems, making the intervention more difficult to implement. Most of the participants were identified by their general practitioner during routine consultations, although in some practices the electronic patient records were also regularly screened for details of adults with a recent diagnosis of depression to identify any potentially eligible people. The study targeted adults aged 18-69 who either were not taking antidepressants at the time of assessment or had been prescribed antidepressants within four weeks of assessment but had not taken these for at least four weeks before that period. General practitioners excluded those who were unable to complete self administered questionnaires in English; had medical contraindications to physical activity; were being treated for psychosis, bipolar disorder, or major substance misuse; or were pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of assessment. At baseline, patients were only eligible to be included in the study if they had a current diagnosis of ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) depressive episode F32 from the computerised clinical interview schedule-revised,7 8 a Beck depression inventory9 score of at least 14, and provided written informed consent. Recruitment for the trial took place between August 2007 and October 2009 in general practices in the south west of England.
Randomisation, concealment, and blinding Randomisation was stratified to take account of self reported antidepressant use (yes, no) and was minimised by severity of depression (clinical interview schedule-revised score ≤25, 26-33, ≥34 at baseline), recruiting centre (Bristol, Exeter), and self reported level of physical activity (≤1, 2-3, ≥4 days per week, with at least 30 minutes of moderate or vigorous intensity physical activity). Treatment allocation, concealed from the study researchers using an automated telephone system, was administered remotely and employed a computer generated code. Owing to the nature of the intervention, none of the participants, general practices, clinicians, or researchers performing the outcome assessments could be blinded to treatment allocation.
Follow-up Collection of follow-up data took place between August 2008 and October 2010. Participants were asked to provide data at three time points; four, eight, and 12 months post-randomisation, using a self completion questionnaire to eliminate any observer bias. The four month follow-up was chosen as the primary outcome endpoint as it represented the stage in the intervention period at which we expected to observe the largest effect, as well as being an appropriate point at which to review the participants' progress from a clinical perspective. The eight month follow-up broadly coincided with the end of the intervention delivery period,. Data were collected at 12 months to investigate any longer term effects of the intervention on study outcomes. To maximise retention, researchers arranged to meet participants to supervise their data collection at the four and 12 month follow-up points, whenever possible. Participants who were unable to attend these follow-up sessions were contacted by telephone to arrange a further appointment or were sent the questionnaire by post if a face to face session was not possible. Due to restricted resources, eight month follow-up was done solely by postal questionnaire.
Intervention and comparator (usual care) Participants in both groups were asked to continue to follow the healthcare advice of their general practitioner for their depression and were therefore free during the trial to access any treatment usually available in primary care, including the use of antidepressants, counselling, referral to “exercise on prescription” schemes, or secondary care mental health services. In addition to this usual care, participants allocated to the intervention group were also offered assistance from a physical activity facilitator. The intervention was based on theory10 11 and was designed to provide individually tailored support and encouragement to engage in physical activity (see box for a summary of the key features). A manual6 was devised to guide the physical activity facilitators, which described a range of motivational interviewing techniques and behavioural strategies to promote participants' uptake of locally available opportunities for physical activity. The aim was to encourage sustainable activity that could be easily incorporated into the participants' lifestyle. The aspiration was for the participants to engage in moderate or vigorous activity for 150 minutes a week in bouts of at least 10 minutes, but if that seemed unrealistic then the facilitator encouraged any increase in physical activity, whatever the intensity.

Lasted about 6-8 months, with most facilitator time in first four months The intervention programme comprised an initial hour-long face to face assessment session followed by two short telephone contacts, then a further face to face meeting for half an hour. Over the course of 6-8-months, the physical activity facilitator offered up to eight further telephone contacts and one more face to face half hour meeting. The scheduling of sessions was left to the discretion of the physical activity facilitator and the participant, although the intention was to have most sessions early in the intervention period, to encourage an increase in physical activity, whereas the later sessions were less frequent and designed to maintain any change. The expectation was that at least five sessions, including one face to face meeting, would have been completed well before the primary outcome endpoint at four months post-randomisation. The physical activity facilitators worked part-time, came from a psychology or an exercise science background, and received training in delivering the TREAD intervention and working with participants who had depression. The facilitators were regularly supervised by some of the investigators.
Outcomes The primary outcome was the Beck depression inventory (version II) at the four month follow-up. The Beck depression inventory is a self report 21 item scale, with higher scores indicating more severe depression.9 The score was treated as both a continuous outcome (range 0-63) and a binary outcome (<10 indicating recovery). Secondary outcomes included the Beck depression inventory at eight and 12 months post-randomisation and a self reported binary measure of antidepressant use from the four, eight, and 12 month follow-up. Physical activity was measured at all three time points using a self completion seven day recall diary in which participants were asked to record 10 minute bouts of light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity in the week before the assessment. We transformed these data into a single weighted score of MET minutes of physical activity per week (where MET was the metabolic equivalent of the task as a ratio to the basal rate). MET minutes were calculated by multiplying the number of minutes of light activity by 2, moderate activity by 4.5, and vigorous activity by 7.5.12 Current government guidelines suggest that adults should carry out 150 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity per week.13 We therefore created a binary variable (<1000 MET minutes per week, ≥1000 MET minutes per week) as an approximate guide as to whether participants were meeting this guideline. The recall diary for physical activity was compared with accelerometry data after the four month follow-up in a subset of participants (n=99). Full details of this comparison are in the report of the trial6 and indicate that there was reasonable agreement between the two measures, considering that accelerometry and the recall diary measured somewhat different aspects of physical activity. There was, however, greater variability between the accelerometer and recall diary for more vigorous activity. Two further secondary outcomes (health related quality of life14 and outcome expectations of physical activity15) were also assessed and analysed; the results are also available in the full trial report.6
Toronto Wolfpack director of rugby Brian Noble admits he's hugely excited to be part of the new League One side – and said Super League glory is the dream for the ambitious Canadians.
Noble was confirmed as a key part of the Wolfpack setup at the launch on Wednesday, with Paul Rowley working as the club's head coach.
And the former Great Britain boss said that he's hugely ambitious about it.
“I was asked basically. I bumped into Adam Fogerty who I've known for years. I met Adam over a couple of breakfasts, went to see David Argyle in his apartment in London alongside Eric Perez, and I thought I'd love to be a part of it,” he said.
“It's brand new – I've done a lot of things in the game but to be involved in this and to take something from nowhere is exciting. Old Trafford is our ambition so it's hugely appealing.
“I'm very ambitious as we all are. We really want to do it the right way and build it the right way and I'm an expansionist at heart, and it's fresh, it's a new land and it's exciting for this sport.”
Noble also insisted that he would like to see a number of Canadian players in the squad from 2017.
“It doesn't work for me if there isn't a Canadian influence,” he said.
“We'll have to work out the numbers but I'd be disappointed if we don't have five or six Canadians eventually but with the speed we want to go at we'd need some substantial players. We'll have six trials in major USA and Canadian cities trialling people who want to be part of it.
“If you have a dream you've got to dream as big as you can. If you speak to everyone involved their goal is Super League – and once you're in there, you've a chance of winning it.”
Last week, federal prosecutors announced that former Georgia deputy Nikki Autry would be indicted on charges of making false statements to a judge in order to obtain a warrant to raid a home in Habersham County. During that raid, one deputy blindly deployed a flash grenade that landed in a playpen, critically injuring a toddler.
From CNN:
In May 2014, Nikki Autry and a team of special agents and informants from the local Narcotics Criminal Investigation and Suppression Team were “attempting undercover narcotics buys.” Autry presented an affidavit to a magistrate judge falsely swearing that a “true and reliable informant” had bought a small amount of methamphetamine at a residence. Based on the erroneous information she presented, which also included claims of “heavy traffic in and out of the residence,” the judge issued Autry a “no knock” search warrant. When a SWAT team executing that warrant found the front door blocked, one of the officers tossed a flash-bang grenade inside the residence. Once inside the home, the SWAT team realized a portable playpen had been blocking the door, and the flash-bang grenade had landed where a 19-month-old was sleeping, eventually exploding on the child's pillow. The toddler spent weeks in a burn unit in a medically induced coma . . . The federal indictment concludes the raid should not have happened. “Without her false statements, there was no probable cause to search the premises for drugs or to make the arrests,” acting U.S. Attorney John Horn said in a release. “In this case,” he said, “the consequences of the unlawful search were tragic.” According to the indictment, Autry is charged with four counts of civil rights violations for “willfully depriving the occupants of the residence of their right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.” Autry is also charged with depriving the man suspected of selling drugs, Wanis Thonetheva, of “his right to be free from arrest without probable cause.”
Days after the raid, Habersham County Sheriff Joey Terrell cleared his deputies of any wrongdoing. Here's what he said in May of last year:
Terrell said both the district attorney and Georgia Bureau of Investigation have said there was no wrongdoing on the SRT's part. “I've talked to the D.A., I've talked to the GBI,” Terrell said. “I've given them the whole information and they say there's nothing else we can do. There's nothing to investigate, there's nothing to look at. Given the information given, GBI's SWAT team would have done the exact same thing – they'd have used the exact same scenario to enter the house.”
Here's what he told ABC News at about the same time:
The sheriff said that the Special Response Team, SRT, did the best they could with the information they were given. A confidential informant was sent to the residence on Tuesday to make a buy for methamphetamine, Terrell said. At the time of the purchase, there were two Mercedes SUVs parked in the driveway, with a guard standing at the front door and the back door. The informant did not enter the home and made the alleged purchase in the doorway, the sheriff said. “It was really uncomfortable, and really intimidating. The informant made the purchase and left the residence,” Terrell said. “He didn't see anything to indicate that there was a child in the house.” After the buy, the SRT came back with a no-knock warrant to arrest the suspected dealer.
According to federal prosecutors, none of these things were true. There either was no informant or Autry lied about what the informant said. There was no guard. There was no drug buy in the doorway. The GBI also denied at the time that it had approved the raid. The agency began investigating the case in June of last year but doesn't appear to have issued a report.
In a sane world, Georgia officials would have learned from this case that violent, confrontational, forced-entry police raids are a terrible way to serve search warrants on people suspected of low-level drug crimes. In a sane world, we'd understand that because all parties to a drug transaction are consensual, there's no direct victim to report the crime. Therefore, police must use informants, surveillance and undercover operations to get information. That makes the information rather unreliable. In a sane world, we'd understand that conducting volatile, nighttime raids based on dirty information is a good way to get people injured or killed, whether they're drug dealers, drug users, cops or toddlers.
Instead, Terrell initially blamed the baby's injuries on the suspected drug dealer, whom he called “no better than a domestic terrorist.” That was blame-shifting even if the suspect had been guilty. It was Terrell's deputies who created the violence here, not the guy who allegedly sold a small amount of meth. Yet an assistant district attorney told CNN last year that he was considering charging the drug suspect for the injuries to the baby. And, of course, federal officials now say the guy never actually made the alleged drug sale in the first place. So Terrell's deputies didn't create violence as a disproportionate response to a consensual crime, they created violence for no reason at all.
Terrell then blamed the informant for providing bad information. But this indictment means the bad information never came from an informant. Terrell then told CNN that the baby's parents “were aware of drug activity in the home.” (They were staying with their Georgia relatives because their house in Wisconsin had recently burned down.) This led some enforcement supporters to blame the baby's parents for putting their kid in harm's way, an argument reiterated in a Habersham County brief in response to the parents' lawsuit. We now know that none of this is true.
Now the blame will likely shift to Autry, who has since resigned. If the allegations are true, certainly she deserves some blame. But even if Autry lied, the rest of the raid team and Terrell are still culpable. They clearly did no corroborating investigation before commencing with a violent, no-knock raid on innocent people. The raid occurred hours after the alleged drug buy. According to the family, the suspect the police were looking for had been kicked out of the house weeks earlier. The police didn't know this. Terrell today says that if the police had known there was a child in the home, they would have conducted the raid differently. But if the police had waited another couple of days, long enough to do some actual surveillance, it would have been clear that there was a child inside. The toddler's parents had a car parked in the driveway with a carseat inside. The family says there were even toys in the yard.
But more broadly, the suspect himself was arrested at another residence, without a SWAT team and without incident. He clearly wasn't the violent threat the officers had claimed him to be. So why deploy the commando tactics in the first place? Why not use less aggressive tactics, such as waiting for the suspect to leave, surrounding a house and calling the suspect out? If history is any indication, that's a question Georgia officials probably aren't going to ask. They didn't ask it after Kathryn Johnston died. Or David Hooks. Or after numerous similar incidents.
There's one more lesson to be learned here. Terrell isn't the only official who cleared these officers. District Attorney Brian Rickman did too, as did a grand jury. So did the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. How is it that the sheriff, the DA, a grand jury and the state police all looked into this, and none of them found what the feds found — that this entire raid was based on a series of lies?
As I've pointed out before, it isn't the first time this has happened in Georgia. In fact, it isn't the first time it has happened with this particular drug task force. Back in 2009, the same task force that conducted this investigation shot and killed Rev. Jonathan Ayers after confronting him at a convenience store. Ayers was unarmed and innocent. He became a suspect after investigators saw him talking to a local prostitute they were investigating for dealing drugs. In fact, Ayers was ministering to the woman. The task force as a whole and the officers who shot Ayers were cleared of any wrongdoing. They were cleared by Terrell and another sheriff who oversees them. They were cleared by DA Rickman. They were cleared by a grand jury. And they were cleared by the GBI. Rickman told one local newspaper that investigators went “to extraordinary lengths” to get to the bottom of what happened and that “I do not see how anybody could say the process was unfair based on the lengths that they went to.”
And yet this happened:
Ayers left behind a wife, Abigail, who at the time of his death was pregnant with her first child. She filed a lawsuit and hired her own investigator to look into the shooting. What he found is astonishing. As it turns out, Officer Billy Shane Harrison, the cop who shot Ayers, hadn't taken the series of firearms training classes required for his certification as a police officer. It gets worse. It turns out that Harrison also had received zero training in the use of lethal force. He wasn't authorized to make arrests or to carry a gun. Yet somehow he had been given a position on a narcotics task force, a position that not only gave him a gun but put him in volatile, high-stakes situations where he might be tempted to use it. Abigail Ayers's lawsuit also alleged that Harrison and Officer Chance Oxner, who initially bought the drugs from the woman Ayers was counseling, had a history of disciplinary problems, including use of illicit drugs.
So within six years, we've had two-high profile incidents involving this task force, one that critically injured a baby and one that resulted in the death of an innocent pastor. In both cases, the officers were cleared by the local police agency, the local DA, a grand jury and the state police. And in both cases, outside investigators later turned up information not only damning but also devastating, and that should have been obvious to anyone investigating these cases with any interest in getting at the truth, rather than merely exonerating the police officers involved. These cases are worth keeping in mind when we hear about police investigations that clear other cops of wrongdoing, in Georgia and elsewhere.
Combined, both cases cost the local governments well over $3 million in settlements. Ayers got $2 million. The toddler's family got $1 million (which might cover the child's medical expenses). The alleged drug transaction that led to the investigation ending in Ayers's death was for $50 worth of cocaine. The transaction that nearly led to the death of the toddler was for $50 worth of meth. A dead pastor, a widowed wife, a fatherless baby, a disfigured toddler, $3 million in settlements, who knows how much money spent on investigations and legal fees . . . all over $100 in alleged drug sales.
So here's what we ought to learn from this whole ugly affair:
It's a terrible idea to conduct violent, volatile raids to serve warrants on people suspected of consensual, nonviolent crimes. These raids create violence and put everyone in the vicinity at risk.
It's a bad idea to let police officers investigate other police officers who are accused of wrongdoing.
It's a bad idea to create multi-jurisdictional task forces that are self-funded and not directly beholden to any local political official.
Georgia's Mountain Judicial District needs new leadership.
Habersham County needs a new sheriff.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation probably shouldn't be trusted to conduct unbiased, thorough investigations of other law enforcement officers.
I suspect that as with all the incidents before this one (and all the incidents since), none of these lessons will be learned. And so the raids will go on. And so will the body count.
Beleaguered England manager Roy Hodgson's future will be under intense scrutiny should the Three Lions lose to Switzerland in Basel today. Here in England, intense irritation at the consistent failings of the national team have given way to surges of mild anger after a poor World Cup in Brazil this summer, and an abject 1-0 friendly win over Norway last week.
No, England were never going to win the tournament, but they should have shown the required quality to qualify from the initial group stage, at least. The real questions are these though:
How much blame should really be laid at the door of Hodgson?
Could anybody else realistically do a better job with a bunch of over paid prima donnas who, to put it bluntly, don't really appear to care if they pull on the famous England jersey or not?
This country's failings are not down to a lack of quality, that's for sure–well for now anyway. Though perhaps not recognized as “world class” by many people's standards, Raheem Sterling, Danny Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge all have the potential to be world beaters. They are huge talents whilst being the pick of the current crop.
Hodgson doesn't have the luxury of some of his European counterparts in being able to rotate and select different players from a large pool, but the squad is certainly capable of much more than it currently provides, which is an interesting point, and one that Hodgson should be able to provide a legitimate answer for. Defenders of Hodgson will point out that outside of the top thirty English footballers that could currently represent their national team – and some would question their involvement anyway – one would struggle to name many more capable of raising their game consistently enough to force their way into Hodgson's thinking.
Limited game time in Premier League fixtures does not aid Hodgson nor the player, for match fitness and sharpness are key attributes to any professional footballer. So why are these players not always first choices? And why can't Hodgson insist they are played more?
The very shockingly frightening statistic facing the future of English football is this: Since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, the number of English players plying their trade in the top flight has not only dropped dramatically – it has halved – with only 75 English players starting the first top flight game of last season. This represented a mere 34.1 percent of the entire league. Compare this to the 167 starters and a whopping 69 percent of the league share exactly twenty years ago in the 1993/94 season, and a pattern takes shape. Which does not make for good reading to any genuine England fan.
The real debate lies here though, and it is a debate that will inevitably breed sympathy to both Hodgson and his successors. English football sold its soul when Rupert Murdoch and Sky TV rocked up to look after the big boys in 1992. The product on offer has snowballed to the monster it now is – a truly breathtaking, mouth watering division home to a large percentage of the greats in World football. Eyebrows were raised when the great German forward Jurgen Klinsmann signed for Tottenham, ditto down the road at Arsenal, where the Dutch maestro Dennis Bergkamp became a club legend. Eric Cantona at Manchester United, Gianfranco Zola at Chelsea… the list goes on. But these were footballers that changed the English game with their outrageous flair and skill, and of course players that contributed to the bigger picture – the ‘Premier League Show'. The floodgates would open up, and these foreigners would inevitably be followed by less expensive, industrious players, who would flood the squads of both the Premier League, and the Championship. Taking the places of young English talent in the top two divisions? For sure, but justified moves and perfectly legal given that the UK is in the EU, and there was no restraint on trade.
Travel further down the path of English doom, and you will find kids not encouraged to play football anymore at school, funds cut and a criminally lethargic outlook on the future of the beautiful game. Which all brings us back to Basel, and very ‘hopeful' thoughts of the motherland of football being able to place a big wide grin on its' long suffering fans tomorrow night.
England will try to qualify for Euro 2016 from a group containing only Switzerland as its genuine competitor, and for a time, we will all dream of 1966 again, and prey that ‘this will be the year that ends the hurt'. But everybody knows deep down it won't be – and the root of the issue will still be there. It is certainly feasible to presume that England will not have any international standard players to choose from come 2034. The statistics don't lie – but English international players shouldn't come from the Championship either.

In 2011, scientists made one of the most important discoveries in the history of AI development. They found that graphics processing units (GPUs) are far better at simulating biological learning than central processing units (CPUs).
In retrospect, it seems obvious. Human brains are much more like GPUs than CPUs. Both brains and GPUs rely on parallel processing that simulates and predicts real world physics.
In light of this, AI developers created powerful deep neural networks (DNNs) that emulate human brain function. All the major advances in self-driving cars and language translation are the result of this.
Below is a chart from Nvidia. It shows the explosive progress of AI running the Caffe deep learning platform:
In the meantime, pharma is tapping into this breakthrough to cure the diseases of aging and cut healthcare costs.
Deep Learning and Aging
One company that took on aging is InSilico Medicine. InSilico is one of the biotech companies I write about in my weekly publication, Tech Digest. The company uses DNNs to sort through huge amounts of biological data. The DNNs look for biomarkers (measurable indicators of your biological state such as those included in blood tests) that correlate with aging. For humans, this would be an impossibly complicated and time-consuming task.
InSilico has developed a program that will guess your age within a few years based on a standard blood test. Why should you care?
The reason is that biomarkers indicating old age can be altered. We can identify compounds that can make your biomarkers—and you—younger and healthier. A few of these compounds are already known. But scientists lacked the technology to identify the most powerful ones... until now.
Today, there is a race to find the most effective and safest geroprotectors. These are compounds that can restore you and your biomarkers to a more youthful profile.
One player in this field is the Life Extension Foundation (LEF). It's on a mission to find safe and effective natural geroprotectors without regulatory delays and costs.
Last week, InSilico Medicine announced a product called Ageless Cell. It was developed in collaboration with LEF's head of R&D Andrew Swick, PhD, former Director of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases at Pfizer Global Research and Development. The supplement contains four natural compounds that DNNs have shown can rejuvenate older cells.
LEF has access to blood tests from its customers who take the product. That means data should be available in less than a year. If it works, we can expect other DNN-developed geroprotectors.
Investment Implications
Many biotech companies, including startups, are using AI. That means investors can bet on this trend without exposure to the volatility of biotech startups.
Nvidia (NVDA) is the obvious way to play the growth of DNN applications. The company may have been overvalued at one point, but several negative reports drove its price back to bargain levels.
One indication of the potential of this company comes from Insilico Medicine's CEO. He told me that the company ran calculations for the LEF supplement on a 40 Tflop 4xNvidia Titan X (Pascal architecture) supercomputer. Since then, Insilico built another GPU cluster using 16xTitan X (Pascal), delivering 160 Tflops in GPU computing power.
Despite a collaborative relationship with Nvidia, Insilico couldn't get all the Nvidia GPUs it needed for the project due to high demand for the processors. This points to strong growth potential in this market.
While Nvidia pioneered dedicated GPUs for AI, chip giant Intel (INTC) is catching up. Last year, Intel bought AI startup Nervana and integrated its deep learning architecture into Xeon microprocessors. Intel also benefits from an arrangement with Google to advance AI in multicloud environments.
One tech giant that doesn't seem to be riding this wave is IBM. Big Blue made a big mistake by underestimating the market for AI computer components. Instead, IBM invested in its own cognitive system called Watson. IBM may expand its AI product line, but we'll have to see if the shift comes in time to compete with Nvidia and Intel.
In any case, advanced AI is not just a marginal improvement in analytical tools. It's the only technology capable of exploiting the massive knowledge gained from human genome sequencing.

With Game of Thrones gearing up for its final two seasons, there's a ticking clock to develop another science fiction and/or fantasy television epic to take its place. The Hollywood Reporter suggests that Roger Zelazny's The Chronicles of Amber could be next, as The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman is adapting it for the small screen with Skybound Entertainment (who brought The Walking Dead to AMC as well as its prequel series Fear the Walking Dead).
Zelazny's ten-book series, published between 1970 and 1991, also concerns royal family politics over a throne. But in this case, our hero Corwin awakens on Earth with amnesia. He comes to discover that Earth is just one of many “shadows,” or parallel worlds, that exist between the two true worlds of Amber and the Court of Chaos. As a prince of the royal family, it is Corwin's birthright to rule Amber and fend off the forces of chaos.
Skybound CEO David Alpert said:
Chronicles of Amber is one of my favorite book series of all time, and one of my main inspirations for working in film and television. Getting to produce this project is the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. I can't wait to share this amazing story with a new generation of fans.
In Zelazny (who passed away in 1995), A Song of Ice and Fire author George R.R. Martin found both an inspiration and a friend. As he wrote in an in memoriam post in 1995,
Lord of Light was the first Zelazny book I ever read. I was in college at the time, a long time reader who dreamed of writing himself one day. I'd been weaned on Andre Norton, cut my teeth on Heinlein juveniles, survived high school with the help of H.P. Lovecraft, Isaac Asimov, “Doc” Smith, Theodore Sturgeon, and J.R.R. Tolkien. I read Ace doubles and belonged to the Science Fiction Book Ciub, but I had not yet found the magazines. I'd never heard of this Zelazny guy. But when I read those words for the first time, a chill went through me, and I sensed that SF would never be the same. Nor was it. Like only a few before him, Roger left his mark on the genre.
Kirkman and Skybound are still searching for a writer and haven't shared a sense of the actual timeframe of putting together this series. While we wait for more news, refresh your memory with our The Chronicles of Amber Reread.
Banks are working on plans to help women whose husbands use money to bully them.
One in five adults in Britain have experienced financial abuse at the hands of a partner, according to charity Refuge. The majority are women.
Banks are investigating how they can offer better support, and aim to introduce a code of practice by the end of next year.
This could include guidelines on how quickly a bank should freeze an account if needed and mandatory training for staff on how to recognise and help customers who may be experiencing abuse.
Victims: One in five adults in Britain have experienced financial abuse at the hands of a partner, according to charity Refuge
Banks could even introduce a panic button victims can press to alert them that something is wrong when using a mobile phone or online banking app.
This type of alarm system exists on some cash machines in the U.S. as a way of alerting banks to suspicious behaviour.
Co-operative Bank is retraining more than 3,000 staff and its financial guide to help victims is being handed out at shelters run by Refuge.
One 23-year-old victim, Kaylin, told Money Mail how easy it is for financial abuse to go undetected.
For her, it started when her partner asked how much she earned. Then he wanted her online banking password.
Before long, he was monitoring her spending. He took out secret loans in her name and would even check her wage slips to make sure she was at work when she said she was.
'It was all about control. Victims should remember that it's their money,' says Kaylin.
If you or someone you know is the victim of abuse, contact the National Domestic Violence Helpline on 0808 2000 247 or visit refuge for advice.

Children from the age of 11 are to be taught about sexual consent under new government plans.
The government said it wanted to give young people a "better understanding of the society around them" so they could "make informed choices and stay safe".
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said there were "unimaginable pressures" for young people growing up.
The lessons are planned for mixed and single-sex state and independent schools in every part of England.
Healthy relationships 'crucial'
The plans are being drawn up by the Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education (PSHE) Association, an organisation set up in 2006 to oversee PSHE teaching.
The introduction to the draft document, which is due to be launched this year, says young people should be taught about consent before they are sexually active.
It says learning about healthy relationships is "crucial" to keeping those under the age of 16 who are sexually active "healthy and safe from abuse and exploitation".
The document added that "recognising that some young people will be sexually active before the age of 16 does not equate to encouraging underage sexual activity".
Image copyright PA Image caption Nicky Morgan said abuse in Rotherham, pictured, and Oxfordshire highlighted the need for more guidance
Speaking on the Murnaghan programme on Sky News, Mrs Morgan said it was right to explore issues around consent "in an age-appropriate way".
She said: "We've seen this week with the issues about child sexual exploitation that growing up today is difficult and I think there are unimaginable pressures - compared to when I was growing up - on young people, particularly on girls.
"And I do think it's right, again in an age-appropriate way, that issues around consent, when consent is given, when it is not given, when something goes way beyond the boundaries, who do you report to, it is important. And I know schools want to have the confidence and the tools to teach that well."
'Inadequacy' of action
A DfE spokesman said "good PSHE teaching" gave young people a better understanding of the society around them and supported them to "make informed choices and stay safe".
They added: "We are ensuring teachers have high-quality resources and appropriate support and guidance so they can tackle the issues facing young people today.
"We will also raise the status of PSHE to recognise those schools which are already providing pupils with a well-rounded curriculum and ensure all parents can be confident their child's school is providing a curriculum for life."
However, while the PSHE Association welcomed Mrs Morgan highlighting its plans, it said it was "deeply disappointed" the government had not responded to an Education Select Committee recommendation to make PSHE a statutory part of the curriculum.
Joe Hayman, chief executive of the PSHE Association, said: "Without this change, topics like consent will continue to be squeezed from school timetables and taught by untrained teachers.
"Given that five recent child sexual exploitation inquiries have all highlighted the need for schools to teach pupils how to keep themselves and others safe, the inadequacy of government action on this area is surprising and deeply disappointing."
Oklahoma State quarterback Brandon Weeden hears it all the time. He would be a first-round pick if not for his age.
Weeden, who delayed his football career for five years to play minor-league baseball, turns 29 on Oct. 14. That's a big difference from Andrew Luck, who will be 23 when the regular season begins.
But Trent Dilfer, former NFL quarterback and current ESPN analyst, disagrees that Weeden's age is a negative:
His age (and accrued wisdom) has given him great perspective in life and as a player. Nothing is too big for Weeden and although old in age, he has plenty of time to be a good NFL QB. Think about it: who thinks of their QB on a 10-year plan? If he starts well, he can easily be solid for 7-8 years.
Judging by many mock drafts, Weeden won't slide too far into the second round. The popular pick has been Weeden going to the Browns at No. 37.
In Dilfer's insider piece, he analyzes the seven quarterbacks projected to go in the first three rounds. Of those quarterbacks, Dilfer rates two as immediate starters (Luck and Robert Griffin III) and one other (Weeden) as "able to start soon."
The Browns would send a message by taking running back Trent Richardson in the first round and Weeden in the second. This says that the Browns want players who can make immediate impacts. This also says they aren't concerned about the risks associated with taking a running back in the top-five and an older quarterback in the second round.

Often associated with a socialist utopian ideology, brutalist architecture continues to be a topical modernist movement of the early 20th century, and one that continues to spark debate today. Love them or hate them, the raw concrete tower blocks and shopping centres from the 1950s to the mid-1970s are very much part of our urban landscape.
For her latest series, Raw Hill photographer Marietta Varga (featured previously) wanted to highlight a number of brutalist buildings in London – National Theatre of Great Britain, The Barbican and the Alexandra Road Estate – with the aim to change hearts and minds. By using two subjects, posing in around these buildings, she wanted to draw attention to the "characteristic playful aesthetics" and "artistic value" of brutalist architecture.
"Functional, raw, stunning, monumental, special, ugly, geometric, massive, representative, beautiful, rough – people usually have very divided opinions about brutalist architecture," says Marietta. "Many might only associate the movement to political trends and the ideology of an era that is often associated with a negative spirit, forgetting its artistic value and particular beauty."
Born in Siófok, Hungary, Marietta graduated with a photography degree from the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design in Budapest. She now lives and works in London. Discover more of her beautiful work on Behance or Instagram.
Last event of the Jubilee of Mercy gathers homeless and destitute at the Vatican
Pope Francis on Friday asked the poor for forgiveness for all the times Christians turned away when they saw a poor person or a person living in a state of poverty.
The Pope's apology came during his audience with people who live or once lived on the streets, marking the Jubilee of the Homeless, the final event before the end of the Holy Year of Mercy on Sunday, Nov. 20.
Francis asked the 6000 poor people present in the Vatican's Nervi Hall to teach humanity about dignity, solidarity and peace. He ended the audience with a prayer, surrounded by a group of homeless people who had placed their hands on his shoulders.
Francis spoke off the cuff, after hearing the stories of two poor people, Christian, a Frenchman and Robert, a Pole.
“One of the things Robert said was: we are no different to the greats of this world, we have passions and dreams, in some cases thousands of passions, we want to get back to the top. Passion sometimes makes us suffer, it poses an external and internal obstacle. Sometimes passion is pathological but there is also good passion, a positive passion that leads us to dream. In my opinion, a very poor man or woman can have a different kind of poverty than yours, when they lose the ability to dream, when they lose the ability to cultivate a passion. Never stop dreaming. What are the dreams of a poor or homeless person like? I don't know, but you dream. You dream that one day you may be able to come to Rome and in this case, your dream has come true. You dream that the world will change; it is a seed that grows in your heart. You referred to a word I often use: poverty is in the heart of the Gospel. Only a person who feels they are missing something looks up and dreams. If someone has everything there is nothing to dream of. People, simple people, those who followed Jesus, followed Him because they dreamed that He would heal them and free them, and he freed them. Men and woman with passion and dreams, this is the first thing I wish to say to you: teach everyone, all of us who have a roof over our heads, we aren't lacking food and medication, teach us with your dreams not to content ourselves and teach us to dream, starting with the Gospel, starting from the heart of the Gospel.”
The Pope then summarized Robert's message as saying that people manage to see the beauty of life even in the worst situations. “This means dignity. This is the word that came to mind,” he said. “The ability to encounter, to find beauty even in the saddest of contexts that reflect deep suffering. Only a person with dignity can do that. Dignity is when a person is poor but they don't drag themselves along.”
It is, he continued, the same dignity Jesus had. “He was born poor and lived as a pauper. The dignity of the Gospel, the dignity of a man and woman who earn a living. They are poor, yes, but not dominated, not exploited. I know you will often have come across people who wanted to exploit you, exploit your poverty, but I also know you have felt the beauty of life. This dignity has saved you from slavery. Poor yes, but not slaves. Poverty is at the heart of the Gospel so that it can be lived, slavery is not there to be lived but to be freed from it.”
Acknowledging that life is more difficult for the poor than for him, the Pope noted that “there is always someone who is poorer than us.”
“This is also what dignity is about: showing solidarity towards others, being capable of reaching out to those who are suffering more than we are,” he explained. “The ability to show solidarity is one of the fruits of poverty. When there is an abundance of wealth, one forgets to show solidarity, they are used to having everything. When poverty makes you suffer you show solidarity and reach out to those in worse situations than yours. Thank you for this example: teach the world solidarity.”
And yet, there is a poverty that is even greater than material want, and that is war, the Pope said, calling it a “destructive form of poverty.”
“Peace for us Christians began in a stable, a manger, in a marginalized family,” the Pontiff told the gathering. “This is the peace God wants for each of His children. Your poverty, the situation you are in, can be the starting point for your becoming builders of peace. Let the rich wage war amongst themselves, in search of more, more land, more money. It's very sad when you witness war among poor people because it is rare. Because of their poverty, the poor are more inclined to be peace workers, creators of peace, they believe in peace. Be examples of peace. We need peace in the world. We need peace in the Church. All Churches need peace. All religions need to grow in peace because all religions must grow in peace. Each of you in your own religions can help the peace that grows inside our hearts, seeking the harmony that brings dignity.”
The Jubilee of the Homeless was organised by Fratello , an association which organizes and hosts events with and for people in situations of exclusion, in partnership with associations assisting such people. On Sunday they will attend a Mass celebrated by Francis in St. Peter's Basilica. Between these two important events there is going to be a big prayer vigil led by the Archbishop of Lyon, Cardinal Philippe Barbarin.
Introducing today's audience, Etienne Villemain, founder of the Lazar association which sponsored the trip to Rome, suggested the institution of a World Day for the Poor in addition to World Youth Day.
Perhaps the best that can be said about President Obama's preemptive sacrifice to the deficit-reduction gods -- a two-year freeze on pay for non-military federal workers -- is that it represents small change. Amid widespread calls for big immediate cutbacks that could endanger a painfully weak recovery, the president's proposal might seem a modest offering to calm the screeching deficit hawks.
But the price isn't as small as the numbers suggest. In one fell swoop, the president has validated three dangerous myths that, if accepted, are likely to consign the United States to years of economic struggle and a continued widening of the huge gap in our society between the richest and the rest.
Myth #1: Public-sector workers are the root of our economic problems
Anyone who watches Fox on a regular basis might be forgiven for thinking that the biggest problem facing our nation is overpaid public workers. So it's worth pointing out that study after study has shown that public workers are generally underpaid. Yes, federal employees don't receive the bottom-floor wages seen in private service jobs -- a border patrol agent may well make more than a private security employee -- but neither do we see the exorbitant pay at the top. As the economist Nancy Folbre puts it, "Some oinking can definitely be heard out there in the labor market, but anyone willing to follow the numbers can tell that the biggest piggies are not those employed by the federal government."
But these statistics are somewhat beside the point. The deeper problem is that there's no credible case that the pay of public-sector workers has anything to do with our current crisis. After all, if public-sector workers are overpaid today, they were also overpaid a year before the economy tanked. By contrast, we know that many of the private-sector "piggies" on Wall Street had a lot to do with our current crisis. Their pay, however, is not freezing, but getting hotter and hotter.
Myth #2: The number one priority is to cut spending now to reduce the deficit
Most Americans think that getting the economy back on track is far more important than the tackling the deficit. In Washington, however, fiscal austerity--or at least lip service to it--has become the defining test of seriousness. Perhaps it's easier to feel this way when your family, friends, and neighbors are not among the millions of Americans who are out of work or working part time despite wanting a full-time job. How else can we explain why Congress cannot muster sufficient support to extend unemployment benefits to the two million Americans whose benefits are set to expire at the end of this month even as its leaders are poised, with the president's tacit support, to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans -- at a cost that vastly, vastly exceeds the savings produced by a federal spending freeze?
Getting the deficit under control requires an economic recovery. After all, this was the story of the 1990s. The real work of tackling the national debt is figuring out a long-term plan that will bring spending and revenues in line over the coming decades, and this work will only succeed against the backdrop of a reasonably strong economy. In the current context, deficit fixation is actually a dangerous distraction from the real and present danger that our economy will slip into stagnation.
Myth #3: There's no will or ability to challenge the runaway gains at the top of the economic ladder even as middle-class Americans lose ground
We all know Wonder Woman — she's one of the most iconic member of the Justice League and there's a new movie about her coming out next year, maybe you've heard — but what do we know about how she came to be created? The comic character's actual history is a fascinating tale, and today Connie Britton and Oliver Platt have just been cast in Sony's film about her origins, titled Professor Marston & The Wonder Women .
Deadline reports that Britton and Platt are the latest to join the cast which includes Rebecca Hall, Luke Evans, and Bella Heathcoate. Britton plays a psychologist who called Professor Marston , the creator of Wonder Woman, anti-feminist, and Platt will play M. C. Gaines, the editor at Sensation Comics who discovered Superman. Here's Deadline 's outline of the synopsis, as we know it:
The film details the true story of Dr. William Moulton Marston (Evans), Harvard psychologist and inventor who created Wonder Woman in 1941; his wife, fellow psychologist and inventor Elizabeth (Hall); and their polyamorous relationship with Olive Byrne (Heathcote), a former student of Marston's and an academic in her own right.
A bit of trivia: Marston was the inventor of the lie detector test, and believed that women were more honest than men. Sounds like the kind of guy who'd invent a powerful Amazon with a truth lasso. His wife was the one to suggest that his character be female, and their lover Olive was the model for Diana Prince. The plurality of the title — “Wonder Women ,” instead of “Wonder Woman ” — suggests that this movie will be as much about the real women in Marston's life who influenced his character, as the character herself. The trio has a fascinating history, and it's astonishing that their story hasn't been made into a movie yet.
Professor Marston & The Wonder Woman also has a diverse bunch on the production side: director Angela Robinson is a gay woman of color, and the production studio Topple Productions was co-founded by Transparent 's Jill Soloway. Wonder Woman was the standout character in Batman v. Superman , and it's about time we got to know a little more about how she happened in the first place.
Everyone from early investors to cybercriminals has benefited from the huge spike in the value of bitcoin in the past few weeks. It's a boon for one other outfit that has likely racked up tens of millions of dollars' worth of the cryptocurrency: WikiLeaks.
The transparency organization may be sitting on a stockpile of bitcoin valued at around $25 million, and has likely exchanged several other large cryptocurrency caches for fiat cash, according to two sources who independently analyzed WikiLeaks' bitcoin transactions.
“Last wallet looks like his piggy bank,” John Bambenek, a security expert who has previously tracked Neo-Nazis' use of bitcoin, told The Daily Beast, pointing to a specific bitcoin address believed to be linked to WikiLeaks.
An oft-repeated myth is that bitcoin is an anonymous currency. Although it can sometimes be harder for observers to determine which bitcoin address belongs to whom, the blockchain —the ledger listing all bitcoin transactions—is entirely public. Using this, it's often possible to see which bitcoin wallets are associated with one another, perhaps link them to real identities, and infer what a bitcoin transaction was for. As The Daily Beast has previously reported, some law-enforcement agencies, including the IRS, have purchased software designed to make tracking bitcoin easier.
Since at least 2011, WikiLeaks has allowed supporters to send bitcoin donations. As noted by James Ball, a journalist and former WikiLeaks staffer, whoever is in control of this address—presumably WikiLeaks—moved around 3,000 bitcoin, worth $800 each, into a series of other accounts on one day in December 2013. At the time of writing, only around 1.5 bitcoin, or about $23,000, remains in the advertised donation address.
So, where did WikiLeaks' bitcoin fortune go?
Bambenek pointed to several addresses that all received a substantial amount of bitcoin from the main WikiLeaks address, and three WikiLeaks-linked addresses are holding around 1,500 bitcoin, or just shy of $25 million, at the time of publication. A second source, who has access to blockchain analysis software used by law-enforcement agencies but who asked to remain anonymous, independently came to the same conclusion. Bambenek added there are another dozen or so accounts that contain an additional 60 bitcoin.
Of course, there is a chance that WikiLeaks didn't move its funds to another address, but, for some reason, sent 1,500 to someone else.
“Well, considering Julian is holed up in an embassy, it's entirely possible someone else has physical possession. But would you trust that cash to someone else?” Bambenek said.
Julian Assange and the main WikiLeaks Twitter account did not respond to a request for comment.
Unsurprisingly, it appears WikiLeaks may have converted some of its bitcoin donations into much more practical fiat currency, too. Several other large chunks of bitcoin moved from the WikiLeaks donation address to BitPay, a bitcoin exchange platform, Bambenek said. “I am assuming he spent, because it went to BitPay,” Bambenek added, referring to WikiLeaks founder Assange. The second source said WikiLeaks has spent around 3,500 bitcoin since its move to the digital currency.
WikiLeaks' use of bitcoin is not just a cryptocurrency success story, though. The lack of information on how those funds are being used brings up questions around, ironically, the group's transparency concerning its own finances.
“Obviously it's not at all a good thing for a transparency group to be so opaque,” Ball, the former WikiLeaks staffer, told The Daily Beast. As Ball has noted, WikiLeaks has not published any accountability information recently. The Wau Holland Foundation, a German nonprofit that has processed donations for WikiLeaks, has published some details on what WikiLeaks spent its funds on, including processing submissions and covering expenses.
“WikiLeaks had its biggest year of operations [with] Collateral Murder, the Afghan and Iraq war logs, the State [Department] cables in 2010 and spent only €400,000. The value of their current stock of bitcoin is vastly higher and they've spent many already,” Ball continued.
“What is it being used for? Who gets paid what? What are their actual outgoings? They wouldn't put up with this lack of accountability from any other organization, so shouldn't do it themselves,” he added.
Assange has previously spoken about investing in bitcoin. In an October tweet, he cheekily “thanked” the U.S. government for spurring WikiLeaks' move to cryptocurrency in the first place, saying it was due to the banking embargo against the group, which prohibited donations via Visa, PayPal and other processors in 2010.
“It caused us to invest in bitcoin [...] with [over] 50,000% return,” Assange tweeted.
In November, The Daily Beast reported the nonprofit Freedom of the Press Foundation was exploring cutting donation ties with WikiLeaks as the financial blockade was apparently over. Shortly afterward, the nonprofit announced its separation from WikiLeaks.
This month, cryptocurrency-focused news site CoinDesk reported that WikiLeaks would soon accept donations through more cryptocurrencies. In August, WikiLeaks announced it would also source donations in Zcash, a privacy-focused coin.

BEIJING — Huawei and Xiaomi are the rock stars of Chinese high-tech. Coming from vastly different backgrounds and experience, they share one goal: Connect everything.
Huawei's technological prowess in telecom and Xiaomi's agility in China's consumer electronics market illustrate both companies' potential and their weaknesses. Understanding the differences offers a glimpse into the future — where China is guiding the global electronics industry.
First, the commonalities between the two Chinese companies:
1. Staying private
Neither Huawei nor Xiaomi is publicly traded. Huawei, in particular, has famously chosen to stay private since its foundation in 1987.
As Shao Yang, president of strategy marketing department of Huawei's consumer business group, told us, being private has allowed Huawei to dodge the rat race of quarterly pressures and to take a long view. By chipping away at the global telecom gear market over 20 years, Huawei today holds a 50 percent market share in the 4G market in Europe, according to Yang.
Huawei's revenue in 2014 was $45.5 billion, its profit at $4.5 billion.
Xiaomi, a 5-year-old startup, is also private, with $12 billion in 2014 revenue, up by 140 percent compared with the year before. Xiaomi sold 61 million smartphones in 2014, a whopping 227 percent increase from the company's 2013 figure. According to IDC, Xiaomi became the world's third largest smartphone vendor last year.
Xiaomi has never revealed its profitability. Many industry observers believe it razor thin.
While both companies are rapidly increasing market share, they've never had to detail the cost of getting there.
2. Most sought-after partner/investor in the industry
Drop Huawei's name to anyone in the IoT world. Leading vendors in different industries are likely to leap at the opportunity for a partnership with Huawei as they devise their own “everything connected” business strategy. Yang told us, “Companies like Benz and BMW are glad to talk to us.”
Xiaomi, in consumer electronics, is not just the darling of the media. It's also the most sought after investor many startups are looking for. Huami, who developed Mi band, is a good example. Xioami's investment and support in defining the Mi band pushed the wearable startup into stardom in China.
3. Youth movement
The youthful energy Xiaomi emanates is natural. But the older company, Huawei, also takes pride in staying fit and young. With its employee retirement age set at 45 and an annual infusion of 10,000 graduates fresh out of college, Huawei keep its engineering workforce young, passionate and selflessly hard-working.
Similarities between the two companies, however, stop there. Huawei is a behemoth of 170,000 employees. Xiaomi is a startup with 8,000.
Key differences between the two companies in their business strategies are as evident as their difference in scale.
1. Hardware vs. Internet
The foremost difference is probably “how we think of hardware,” said Bin Lin, president and co-founder of Xiaomi. “At Xiaomi, we want to offer our hardware at amazing prices – almost at BOM cost.”
Just as Google never charges per search, Xiaomi's interest is not in profiting from big markup on each hardware sale, he explained.
Instead, “we are interested in connecting the devices we sell to the cloud. We let the computers crawl the data — with your permission — and analyze your behavior, and find the information and services to make your life easier,” said Lin. In short, Xiaomi is going after the big data/service model established by Google and Facebook.
Xiaomi, however, is hardly indifferent to hardware. Xiaomi's founders are fanatical about the details of their products and genuinely interested in how people use them. They just don't regard them as a key source of future revenue.
Meanwhile, Huawei knows better than anybody else about matters related to connectivity, data servers and telecom gear. Their primary business, however, remains selling hardware gear.

Pope Francis holds his weekly general audience on March 5, 2014 at St.Peter's square in Vatican city.

Despite widely reported anecdotes of lapsed Catholics returning to the pews, growth in Mass attendance and renewed interest in the Roman Catholic Church during Pope Francis' first year, a new report has found the "Pope Francis effect" may not exist after all.
In a survey released Thursday about Americans' views of the pope nearly a year into the papacy, the Pew Research Center found no change in the share of American adults who call themselves Catholic, or in self-reported rates of Mass attendance, when compared to pre-Francis numbers. Pew also reported no increase in the percentage of Catholics volunteering at their churches or going to confession.
While Catholics and non-Catholics alike gave Francis high ratings in the poll, and Pew found a "widespread perception that he is a change for the better," it said it was "less clear whether there has been a so-called 'Francis effect,' a discernible change in the way American Catholics approach their faith."
Today, 22 percent of Americans identify as Catholic, which is the same percentage as in the year before Francis' election. Forty percent of those Catholics said they attend Mass weekly, which is also unchanged since the months before Francis became pope.
About 13 percent of Catholics say they have been volunteering more in their church over the last year, but 23 percent said they have been volunteering less and 59 percent say their volunteering has not changed. Just 5 percent of Catholics have been going to confession more often over the past year, while 22 percent have been attending less often and 65 percent say they haven't changed how often they go to confession.
A quarter of Catholics said they have been more excited about their faith over the last year, and 40 percent said they have been praying more during that time. Pew said it could not conclusively link those increases to Francis because the questions on excitement over faith and frequency of prayer were not explicitly tied to the new pope and came elsewhere in its survey.
Even without connecting any major changes in Catholic practice to the pope, Pew found high approval of Francis. More than 80 percent of U.S. Catholics said they viewed Francis favorably, and the percentage who viewed him "very favorably," 51 percent, was comparable to the high approval ratings for Pope John Paul II in the 1980s and 1990s.
While large majorities of respondents praised the pope for spreading the Catholic faith, standing up for traditional moral values, addressing the needs of the poor and reforming the Vatican bureaucracy, Francis got lower marks for his handling of clergy sex abuse.
In the Pew survey, just over half of Catholics gave Francis a rating of "excellent" or "good" for how he has handled sex abuse. When Pew polled on the issue last March, 70 percent of Catholics said that addressing sex abuse should be a "top priority" for the pope -- more so than any other issue.
On Wednesday, in a separate interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera, the pope defended the church's reaction to sex abuse, saying it was "probably the only public institution to have acted with such transparency and responsibility" and that "no other organization has done more." The statement brought a strong backlash from survivors' advocates.
The Pew survey also reported an increasing share of Catholics who believe that by the year 2050, the church will change its stances on birth control, ordaining women and allowing priests to marry.
The Transportation Security Administration said it is unlikely to detect and unable to extinguish what an FBI report called “the greatest potential incendiary threat to aviation,” according to a classified document obtained by The Intercept. Yet despite that warning, sources said TSA is not adequately preparing to respond to the threat.
Thermite — a mixture of rust and aluminum powder — could be used against a commercial aircraft, TSA warned in a Dec. 2014 document, marked secret [PDF here]. “The ignition of a thermite-based incendiary device on an aircraft at altitude could result in catastrophic damage and the death of every person onboard,” the advisory said.
TSA said it is unlikely to spot an easy-to-assemble thermite-based incendiary device during security screening procedures, and the use of currently available extinguishers carried on aircraft would create a violent reaction. The TSA warning is based on FBI testing done in 2011, and a subsequent report.
A thermite device, though difficult to ignite, would “produce toxic gasses, which can act as nerve poison, as well as a thick black smoke that will significantly inhibit any potential for in-flight safety officers to address the burn.”
TSA warned federal air marshals not to use customary methods of extinguishing fires — the water or halon fire extinguishers currently found on most aircraft — which would make the reaction worse, creating toxic fumes. Instead, air marshals are told to “recognize a thermite ignition” — but TSA has provided no training or guidance on how to do so, according to multiple sources familiar with the issue.
TSA circulated these Dec. 2014 materials through briefings, according to sources familiar with the issue, but did not offer up guidance on what to do with this information, and equipment that could mitigate this threat, like specific dry chemical extinguishers, has not been provided. According to the TSA advisory, federal air marshals and other on-flight officers should: recognize a thermite ignition, advise the captain immediately, ensure the individual who ignited the device is “rendered inoperable,” and move passengers away from the affected area.
“We're supposed to brief our [federal air marshals] to identify a thermite ignition — but they tell us nothing,” said one current TSA official, who asked not to be named because the official is not authorized to speak to the press. “So our guys are Googling, ‘What does thermite look like? How do you extinguish thermite fires?' This is not at all helpful.”
Several aviation officials, who also asked not be named, confirmed they had been briefed on the threat, but given no information or training on identifying thermite ignition. “They say to identify something we don't know how to identify and say there is nothing we can do,” one federal air marshal said. “So basically, we hope it's placed somewhere it does minimal damage, but basically we're [screwed].”
Aviation security officials who spoke with The Intercept said TSA floods its employees with intelligence products from other agencies on various types of threats, but does not tell its employees what, if anything, to do about this threat. “You're signing off on this saying you've received this briefing,” a former transportation security official said. “This covers their ass in case something happens, they can say, ‘We shared our intel.'”
“As a general matter, DHS, the FBI and other partners in aviation security regularly share information on potential threats affecting air travel safety,” S.Y. Lee, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, told The Intercept in a statement. “This information is shared in a timely and consistent fashion. When relevant and actionable information is developed, we work to identify countermeasures to mitigate the threat.”
The TSA bulletin was distributed by the agency's Office of Intelligence and Analysis in response to a Dec. 10 classified 29-page FBI Intelligence Assessment titled, “Threat Assessment of Viable Incendiary Devices to Passengers and Aircraft.” A copy of that report was also obtained by The Intercept.
According to the FBI's description of their tests, thermite devices “spew molten metal and hot gasses” and can potentially “burn through steel and every other material” on the aircraft.
“Since 9/11/01, coordination between public safety, aviation, and national security focused agencies occurs on a continuous and collaborative basis to identify and neutralize threats to aviation safety,” the FBI said in a statement to The Intercept. “While often this analysis is done regardless of the specific threat environment, we nonetheless work closely with aviation security experts regularly to examine all potential vulnerabilities. Information is then shared immediately with those responsible for aviation security for appropriate security enhancement considerations.”
Despite the TSA warning, and FBI report, how much of a threat thermite represents to aviation security is up for debate.
“Available reporting at this classification level, however, does not indicate any extremist interest in thermite to target aircraft,” the FBI report said.
A source with knowledge of current threats to aviation said other intelligence gained from safe houses overseas points to greater interest, not in thermite, but in other types of incendiary materials.
Jimmie Oxley, a professor of chemistry at the University of Rhode Island, and an expert in explosives and explosives detection, said thermite — though a theoretical threat — seemed an unlikely candidate to slip through security, particularly since the would-be terrorist would also have to carry an igniter. “You've got to get a pound of something that is a really thick mass through security without anyone noticing,” she said. “I find that hard to believe.”
The problem is one of practicalities, said Oxley, who has worked with the FBI and other federal agencies on explosives testing, but was not aware of the specific TSA or FBI reports on thermite obtained by The Intercept. If the hope were to burn a hole through the aircraft, then the thermite would have to be placed on the floor, and then there's still no guarantee it would take down the aircraft.
Setting off thermite is also impractical, according to Oxley. “Somebody has to give you time to play on the plane,” she said. “Like with the shoe bomber, people do notice if you're doing something weird in this day and age.”
While declining to address thermite specifically, Lee, the Homeland Security spokesman, insisted that the aviation security system is robust: “Today, all air travelers are subject to a robust security system that employs multiple layers of security, both seen and unseen, including: intelligence gathering and analysis, cross-checking passenger manifests against watchlists, thorough screening at checkpoints, random canine team screening at airports, reinforced cockpit doors, Federal Air Marshals, armed pilots and a vigilant public. In combination, these layers provide enhanced security creating a much stronger and protected transportation system for the traveling public. TSA continually assesses and evaluates the current threat environment and will adjust security measures as necessary to ensure the highest levels of aviation security without unnecessary disruption to travelers.”

A photo of the author with her dad. My father, the woman Dad was in the process of a sex change when he was murdered. Years later, I still struggle to understand why
My siblings and I have a hard time on Father's Day. It reminds us that the anniversary of our dad's murder is around the corner: July 7, 1993. I was 22 when he died, shot by strangers in his basement, and every year we wrestle with how to honor his complicated memory. Lately, we can't even agree if he was a man, let alone our father.
I fought with my sister about this two years ago on Father's Day, when I was back home in Seattle visiting her. We avoided the topic all day, until she came home in the wee hours from her bartending job at a gay bar.
Advertisement:
“I was talking with Jean tonight about Dad,” she said. Jean was one of her transgender customers. “And Jean said, ‘Maybe you were never meant to celebrate Father's Day, because your dad was always meant to be a woman.'” She looked at me as though this might be a consolation, but I was having none of it.
“That's absurd!” I said, because I believe our dad was a man through and through. He was 6-foot-7. He was lanky, deep-voiced. I often described his personality as somewhere between Anthony Bourdain and Howard Stern. What was most damning, in my mind, was how physically abusive he was to my mother and me. Bridgette missed much of this. She was 5 when I went into foster care at 15. The court made my dad take anger management classes after that. “He was always talking about how he hated women,” I said. “If that's the case, how could he have really been one?”
Bridgette closed her mouth, and refused to open it again. The topic was too loaded. We didn't speak a word about it for the rest of the trip.
My father decided to get a sex change shortly before his murder. He had been a cross dresser as long as I could remember, but he always kept his “dress-up times” -- as my mother and I referred to them -- confined to the house. Though he went by Tom usually, during these interludes, he insisted we call him “Tommy.” By day he worked male-dominated professions: He owned a tree removal company, which required him to wield chainsaws. When business was slow, he drove a cab. At night he would come home and transform into Tommy, but not every night. He could go for nights, weeks, months without dressing up. In the late '80s, when I went into foster care, he stopped for several years completely.
Then the '90s hit: RuPaul was in vogue, and gay pride went mainstream. It seemed like everyone was coming out of the closet. I had been away from home for five years, living in California, going to Scripps, a small private women's college. But I called home regularly, mostly to check on Bridgette and my younger brother, Reggie. When they started referring to dad as “Tommy,” I knew something was up.
I came back to visit Seattle during the winter break of my sophomore year in college. My father greeted me at the door with a smirk on his face and a tight pink turtleneck that hugged his new breasts. I don't know which made him more proud: having breasts of his own, or so successfully shocking me with them. He was taking hormones.

Soon after that, unbeknownst to me, he started growing high-grade marijuana in the basement. He sold it to finance the sex change. A year and a half into this experiment, two teenagers tried to convince him to let them deal for him. After he refused, they broke into the basement to rob him. When he came down to see what the commotion was, they ran away -- then turned around, stopped, and shot him from 50 feet away.
The police discovered $80,000 of marijuana in my family's home. The detective assigned to my father's case speculated that he was three to six months shy of being ready for the official sex-change operation. The detective also said that all the women at the morgue were insanely jealous of my father's perky breasts. He told me my father's penis had shrunk to the size of a seahorse.
I don't know why he shared this. Maybe he could see I was longing to make sense of things. But I was already numb and shell-shocked.
It had been three days since I received the news from my aunt. She called before 9 a.m. “Your father was shot. He died this morning.” And when I heard that word – “died” -- I crumpled to the floor in sobs. That night, I went to a friend's house and fell asleep after hours of crying, an awful sound that was somewhere between the wail of a child and the howl of a coyote. When I got up the next day, I resolved to silence that wounded animal sound. I was frightened if I gave in to it again, I would lose control completely.

And someone needed to be in control. I needed to book my flight home. I needed to help with the funeral. When I arrived back in Seattle, my mother had not changed her clothes in two days. She'd never been in the best command of her emotions, but this unmoored her. She told and retold the story of how my father died. She tried to take my brother and sister with her to dress my father's body for the funeral. She thought it would bring closure. But I was mortified, and fought her to leave them home. I couldn't bear the thought that their last image would be his naked body, ravaged with bullet wounds and the marks of the coroner's examination. I would have felt this way even if he didn't have breasts.
She relented, and took a friend to clothe the body on her own. She dressed my father in his favorite pink turtleneck and placed a black doily on his head. One of them applied a garish turquoise blue eye shadow, red lipstick and pink rouge.
The next day, at the bizarre funeral my mother led herself, the director came up to me. “We have never seen anything like this in all our days in business.”

I wanted to laugh, but I was too angry. My father's death had turned into a complete freak show.
But I got to wave goodbye to the freak show. I returned to college a thousand miles away and shared my experience with my close circle of friends, who were supportive and understanding. Meanwhile, Bridgette went to the middle school down the block from the porch where our father died, staining the cement with a pool of blood. She was teased mercilessly for being the daughter of a cross-dressing, drug-dealing father -- and this was in Seattle, supposedly a progressive place. But kids can be mean anywhere. I wonder sometimes if this is why she began to defend his choices: because she was so tired of being beaten down herself.
My sister grew up with such a different father than I did. He had decided to become a woman by then, and so began to openly shun (and also, I suspect, secretly relish) the stares and disapproval from outsiders. Meanwhile, I had a father who took me fishing and hunting and taught me how to defend myself against an attack.

The irony is that the only person who ever attacked me was my father. When I reached my teens, he set aside the belt and started using his fists. That's when I left home. I sometimes wonder if he knew that time would come, and wanted to prepare me. I have never known what drove my father's anger, but it was obvious that he carried around a deep self-loathing. What I don't know is which part he despised more: the part that wanted to be a woman, or the part that was born a man.
The last time I saw my father was six months before he was killed. Again visiting at winter break. I gave him a small picture of myself and told him that I forgave him. He laughed and said he was sorry. His laughter was often full of mocking. This was one of those times. Each of us offered our words grudgingly. I went back to school thinking, Well, it's not much, but it's a start. That was the closest to reconciliation we ever got.
I can forgive him for being abusive, but I confess it is harder for me to make peace with his decision to become a woman. Some of my resistance is based purely on appearance: He never looked like a woman, despite the breasts and makeup. But I suspect there is a deeper reason. If I embrace the idea that he was a woman, it would mean I did not have a dad. I would rather have an asshole for a father than no father at all.
Maybe if he had lived we would have worked this out. We would have had a conversation, I would have learned to live with the contradictions. But instead, there are so many unanswered questions I can't ask. There are so many things I wish he could help me understand. Therapy has helped me make sense of some of this, but honestly, what pushes me forward most are my dreams.

Years after my father died, I would have a nightmare that he was my enemy, and he was barring me from seeing my brother and sister. This wasn't so far from the truth. After I left home, he would only let me visit with them if he was present, and he even monitored our phone conversations. But in the dream his actions are harsh, spiteful, unyielding. I would wake up from these dreams with my heart pounding. When I realized he was dead, I felt instant relief that he couldn't hurt me. Then I felt guilt for being thankful he was gone. I wrestled with that guilt, because I knew he was not the monster this dream was making him out to be. He was very human, very broken, and he saw no other path to happiness. Did it ultimately matter if that path didn't make sense to me?
I began to feel more compassion toward him, and with that came grief and loss. I have a different recurring dream now. In it my father has faked his death and is alive, happily living as a woman. I am the only one in my family who knows this, and I must decide if I will tell them. I can't make up my mind. The deep distress I feel over the decision jars me awake. I blink away the dream and find my mind is playing tricks on me again. Then reality hits once more: He is still dead. But I am no longer relieved. Instead, I am surprised to find how much my heart aches to know that he is gone. The simple truth is this: I miss him.
Randy Neugebauer says he called out 'baby-killer' as Stupak spoke on House floor
Updated 3:35 p.m. 3/22/10
By Paul Kane
Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R-Tex.) acknowledged Monday that he yelled out "baby killer" toward Democrats during debate over a Republican abortion amendment in the final minutes of consideration of health-care legislation.
The backbench Republican from west Texas said he has apologized to Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.), who was urging the House to vote down the amendment when Neugebauer made his outburst.
Neugebauer said Monday that the debate brought out too much passion in his disagreement with the deal Stupak struck with Obama and congressional leaders over abortion provisions in the legislation.
"In the heat and emotion of the debate, I exclaimed the phrase 'it's a baby killer' in reference to the agreement reached by the Democratic leadership. While I remain heartbroken over the passage of this bill and the tragic consequences it will have for the unborn, I deeply regret that my actions were mistakenly interpreted as a direct reference to Congressman Stupak himself," Neugebauer said in a statement. (Full statement at end of this post.)
The outburst drew immediate shouts of derision from Democrats in the House, but no Republican took ownership for making the comment and Neugebauer's GOP friends declined to identify him Sunday night.
Democratic aides, angered by the silence, linked the "baby killer" shout to some of the heated rhetoric voiced by tea party protesters at the Capitol over the weekend, which included slurs hurled at black and gay Democrats.
Neugebauer is an unlikely lawmaker to find the spotlight. Elected in a special election in the spring of 2003, his highest-ranking position is as ranking Republican on the Agriculture Committee's Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Subcommittee.
The "baby killer" moment served, in some ways, as a symbolic bookend to the infamous "you lie!" shout to President Obama by another little-known Republican, Rep. Joe Wilson (S.C.), last September before a joint session of Congress.
Obama's address that night kicked off his s personal investment in the legislative push to pass a health-care overhaul, a slow-building effort that culminated with Sunday night's vote.
The full House admonished Wilson for his actions, and he apologized privately to White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel -- although he refused to do so in the well of the House. But the incident made Wilson into a conservative icon for a brief moment, and he raised more than $2 million in campaign contributions over a few short weeks in September.
Some colleagues defended Wilson last fall, noting that his charge was based on a controversial immigration provision in the bill, but there was no such defense from Republicans over this latest outburst.
That Stupak was the target particularly galled Democrats. His anti-abortion views made him a key holdout on the overall legislation, and he -- joined by more than a half-dozen Democrats -- supported the legislation only after reaching a deal with Obama to issue an order reaffirming the ban on federal funding for abortions. The lengthy, and often public, negotiations isolated Stupak within his caucus, but his colleagues never doubted his devout Catholic faith and his personal animus toward abortion.
So, after they had already approved the major piece of health-care legislation on a 219 to 212 vote, Democrats entrusted Stupak with the role of speaking in opposition when the GOP offered its lone amendment to a revisions package -- the Republican amendment being mostly a reiteration of Stupak's own preferred legislative wording to restrict abortions. As he rose to speak, the former state trooper from Michigan's Upper Peninsula received a standing ovation from many of his colleagues.
Stupak rejected the effort as a way to defeat the the entire revisions package, which was later approved and sent to the Senate, but in the middle of his speech, a shout was heard across the chamber: "Baby killer."
Nearly 15 hours later, Neugebauer stepped forward, issuing a statement saying his remark was "inappropriate."
Here is Neugebauer's full statement:
"Last night was the climax of weeks and months of debate on a health care bill that my constituents fear and do not support. In the heat and emotion of the debate, I exclaimed the phrase 'it's a baby killer' in reference to the agreement reached by the Democratic leadership. While I remain heartbroken over the passage of this bill and the tragic consequences it will have for the unborn, I deeply regret that my actions were mistakenly interpreted as a direct reference to Congressman Stupak himself.
"I have apologized to Mr. Stupak and also apologize to my colleagues for the manner in which I expressed my disappointment about the bill. The House Chamber is a place of decorum and respect. The timing and tone of my comment last night was inappropriate."
The mother of Newtown school gunman Adam Lanza reportedly told friends about a genetic disorder that killed her grandfather, nearly took her own life and had already manifested itself in her son.
In emails and private chats, Nancy Lanza said her son had been diagnosed with a form of Asperger's syndrome -- a sensory perception disorder that prevented him from recognizing pain and led him to recoil from physical touch, the New York Daily News reports.
“Nancy indicated that Adam's issues were genetic like hers,” friend Marvin LaFontaine told the newspaper.
Lanza, in hundreds of emails obtained by the newspaper, indicated that doctors had no explanation for the autoimmune disorder that killed her grandfather in just six weeks. Doctors found lesions on her brain in 1999 and Nancy Lanza characterized her illness as “like living on top of a time bomb.”
“I am carrying the gene for this type of self-destruct,” she emailed LaFontaine at the time. “My diagnosis was not good. I was going under the premise that I had a limited time left . . . about enough to get the boys settled in. . . . At one point I was trying to deal with the time frame of about 12 months.”
The disease had gone into remission, but Lanza told a friend in January 2012 it had “flared up.” By November, she realized her son's troubles were deeper than just genetics. Just two weeks before the Newtown shooting, Nancy discovered pictures in her son's room featuring dead bodies, but she did not confront him.
“One (drawing) had a woman clutching a religious item, like rosary beads, and holding a child, and she was getting all shot up in the back with blood flying everywhere,” LaFontaine said. “Nancy was disturbed, really disturbed, but didn't confront him … She wanted to think it over.”
Adam Lanza, 20, fatally shot his mother before killing 26 more people during a rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Dec. 14.

The Razorbacks landed an important piece of their 2016 recruiting class with the commitment of Star City defensive end Austin Capps.
Capps is one of the top players in the state this year and is probably the strongest. He power cleaned 360 pounds recently, which would tie the state record (set by Bijhon Jackson) if he does that at the Arkansas High School Weightlifting Championships.
He's a composite 4* player with offers from Louisville, Ole Miss, and Mississippi State while receiving interest from several others. He's also visited Auburn and LSU. He had discussed letting his recruiting play out through the year but decided to pull the trigger while on an unofficial visit to Fayetteville over the weekend.
Arkansas has done a great job of recruiting defensive linemen since Bret Bielema took over. Capps will join what could be the deepest unit on the team when he makes it to campus next year. The Hogs hope fellow in-state defensive line star McTelvin Agim will be joining him.
Capps is the second commitment of Arkansas' 2016 class, joining Smackover wide receiver Jordan Jones. It's all south Arkansas for the Hogs so far this year (but probably not for long).
SALIM MEHAJER'S sister, the new Miss Lebanon Australia, says she has nothing to fear from an official investigation into allegations her brother bought her beauty pageant victory.
“I would love for [NSW Fair Trading] to investigate and see that I won fairly,” Mariam ‘Mary' Mehajer told the Parramatta Advertiser in her first interview since being crowned last Sunday.
“My brother being a sponsor is such a beautiful thing. He's supporting his community and I think that is so positive.”
The 18-year-old, who was a late entrant and beat seven other contestants, complained about unfair press attention and wants to use her success to change stereotypes of Lebanese Australians.
“I think my community is very misunderstood. I believe the media has used this paintbrush to illustrate this image that we don't actually fit in,” she said.
“A lot of people don't actually classify us as Australians even if we were born here. They're always telling me to go back to my own country.”
Her pageant win has been soured by questions about sponsorship by Mehajer Bros — a company owned by her controversial brother and former deputy Auburn mayor Salim Mehajer — and the fact her sister Aisha was on the organising committee this year.
One contestant has complained to the NSW Office of Fair Trading alleging that the contest was “rigged” and several others are said to have withdrawn when Ms Mehajer was permitted late entry.
Fair Trading is assessing whether the complaint is valid.
Ms Mehajer rejected the claims, pointing out her brother had also been a sponsor last year when Aisha competed and came fourth.
“He [sponsored it] last year and she didn't win so it doesn't mean anything except that he has a good character and he is a good man who puts his ego aside to help others,” Ms Mehajer said.
She said she had not let the controversy affect her.
“I just brush it off. Patience has a beautiful reward. I rather have the fruits of patience than be bitter.”
The law student only entered the pageant three weeks before the event and admitted she felt intimidated by the other contestants.
“A lot of the women were much more mature and much more confident to go on stage and, you know, wear a bikini. I am totally not like that, that was the hardest part, but it was one that I overcame.”
Ms Mehajer, the youngest of eight siblings, declined to answer any further questions about her controversial brother who has had to deny rumours he has split from his wife Aysha.
“My family is my everything. Every day we inevitably get closer. We're all supportive no matter what,” Mary said.
Instead the Auburn teen wants to turn the spotlight on various charity initiatives she will pursue as Miss Lebanon Australia.
“The crown is nothing without action. To me this was not just a beauty pageant but about representing my community,” she said.
Romelu Lukaku must consider leaving Everton for either Manchester United or Bayern Munich at the end of the season, according to his father.
Roger Lukaku told Het Laatste Nieuws‏ that his son, who has scored 25 goals for Roberto Martinez's side this season, is ready to move on.
The 22-year-old Belgium international joined the Toffees in 2014 for £28 million after failing to make the first-team at Chelsea and has become the subject of interest for many of Europe's top clubs with his performances.
"He's ready," Lukaku Sr. told Het Laatste Nieuws‏. "I see that there is interest from Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Chelsea and Manchester United.
"I think he must choose Manchester United or Bayern Munich. Manchester United is a team under construction with no real focus.
"Bayern Munich is a machine where he can rotate well. The only condition is if Robert Lewandowski leaves."
Lukaku distanced himself from the teams suggested by his father, but told Sky Sports News that he wants to play Champions League football next season.
"That is my dad's point of view; I think those are the teams he likes," he said. "It means people are keeping an eye on you.
"I have an agent who is dealing with this for me at the moment. I just want to be good, help my team-mates win games and score lots of goals."
But, asked if he wanted to play in Europe, he said: "That is the next step for me. I'm 23 next summer and I think it would be nice to play in the Champions League from next season."
Lukaku has been linked with a return to Chelsea, but the striker said he does not have any unfinished business at his former club.
"No, I would not say that. I don't think I have anything to prove against them," he said. "I moved on, they moved on. It was the best deal for both teams because they won the league and I became a better player so we will see what the future brings."
Home » You Probably Know, But Need To Hear It Again: The Power of Physical Exercise For Anxiety Relief
You know, but you probably need to be told again: exercise is a foundational pillar of anxiety treatment.
One of the most powerful and effective methods for reducing generalized anxiety and a predisposition to panic attacks is regular, vigorous exercise. Like eating well and getting enough sleep, the power of physical exercise for anxiety relief is one of those things that is widely-known, deceptively simple, and woefully neglected by most individuals suffering from chronic anxiety and panic.
Exercise is an essential component of anxiety treatment. By “essential,” I mean that the effectiveness of other means to address anxiety such as medication, meditation, mindfulness training, etc. should be evaluated in the context of a regular exercise program. Those things all work better if you exercise regularly.
Exercise is a force multiplier for anxiety relief. Whatever else you're working on, exercise makes it even more effective.
There is no silver bullet or one-size-fits approach to anxiety management. The factors to contributing to anxiety and panic vary for everyone. However, regular physical exercise is as close to a “global” prescription for anxiety treatment as there is. Before medication – even before therapy, meditation, diet, sleep hygiene, and mindfulness training – commit to a regular exercise program as the foundation for anxiety treatment.
Physical exercise for anxiety is not going to be the total solution for everyone (though for some it may be). It's not going to work right away. But, it will work.
In other words, if you're not exercising regularly, you need to start.
According to Edmund J. Borne in The Anxiety & Phobia Workbook,
“Regular exercise is an essential component of the total program for overcoming anxiety, phobias, and panic. If you combine exercise with a program of regular deep relaxation, you are undoubtedly going to experience a substantial reduction in generalized anxiety and will very likely increase your resistance to panic attacks as well. Exercise and deep relaxation are the two most effective for altering a hereditary-biochemical disposition to anxiety.”
You have a panic attack when your body's natural fight-or-flight reaction — the sudden surge of adrenaline, cortisol, and other brain chemicals you experience in response to a real threat — becomes excessive or occurs out of context. Physical exercise is a natural outlet for the body to regulate fight-or-flight mode.
Individuals with a hereditary-biochemical disposition to anxiety who exercise regularly are less vulnerable to panic attacks. Exercise can also reduce the intensity of panic attacks when they do occur. Furthermore, exercise can also diminish the tendency to experience anticipatory anxiety toward phobic situations, ranging from heights to social situations.
In addition to the well-known bodily benefits of anxiety such as weight loss, decreased cholesterol and blood pressure, improved digestion, and energy, etc., regular exercise has a direct impact on several physiological factors that underlie anxiety:
More rapid metabolism of excess adrenaline and thyroxin in the bloodstream, the presence of which tends to keep you in a state of arousal and vigilance
Lower sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity
Increased serotonergic and noradrenergic levels in the brain, similar to the effects of antidepressants.
Exercise reduces skeletal muscle tension, which is responsible for feelings of being tense or “uptight”
Increased levels of norepinephrine. Learned helplessness due to chronic stress has been linked to depletion of norepinephrine.
Increased endogenous opioid activity in the central and peripheral nervous system. This euphoric state, sometimes known as “runner's high,” reduces pain and can also have a sustained anxiolytic.
Promotion of neurogenesis (new neural growth) in the hippocampus which has been implicated in the treatment of psychiatric conditions including depression and anxiety
A discharge of pent-up frustration and energy, which can aggravate phobic and panic reactions
The impact of exercise on the mind is as important as its impact on the body.
Exercise improves concentration, memory, our sense of well-being and has a host of other positive psychological benefits.
In Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain, John J. Ratey says,
“Aside from elevating endorphins, exercise regulates all of the neurotransmitters targeted by antidepressants. For starters, exercise immediately elevates levels of norepinephrine, in certain areas of the brain. It wakes up the brain and gets it going and improves self-esteem, which is one component of depression.
Another factor from the body that comes into play here is the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Produced by the muscles of the heart itself when it's really pumping, ANP travels through the bloodstream and into the brain, where it helps to further moderate the stress response and reduce noise in the brain. It's a potent part of a cascade of chemicals that relieve emotional stress and reduce anxiety. Along with pain-blunting endorphins and endocannabinoids, the increase in ANP helps explain why you feel relaxed and calm after a moderate aerobic workout. When you talk about burning off stress, these are the elements at work.”
These physical benefits are just the beginning. If you have anxiety — especially if you are out of shape — you have the world to gain from a regular exercise program. You probably know it, but you need to be told again.
Even with this knowledge, the mind can always locate or contrive reasons to procrastinate. No one is immune to mental excuses. Action is the only solution. Every single person can find a regimen that fits their needs.
Building a habit is key. Start today.
Bobby Wood is on a heck of a run, and everyone knows it. The United States international has 17 goals this season for Union Berlin, surpassing the previous record of 14 for an American in the top two flights of Germany (Conor Casey, for Karlsruher in 2003-04). Wood has now scored in eight straight games and is chasing the 2.Bundesliga record of 12 consecutive matches with a goal.
There is no question that Wood's run is impressive, but what does it mean in terms of what we should expect from him in the years ahead? Looking at the evidence, historical traits, as well as Wood's own personal history, there are both encouraging signs and cautionary tales as to what lies ahead.
To understand his market value, it's best to look back at the last four 2.Bundesliga seasons and examine the players who scored 15 or more goals, as noted in this compliation of scorers.
Predicting the future for a top 2.Bundesliga forward is rough. Even when excluding the older players, those over 30, to make it comparable to Wood ( who is just 23), there are more flops than success stories. Just last season, Rouwen Hennings left Karlsruhe and has scored just one goal for Burnley in the English second division this season.
RECOMMENDED Klinsmann says Wood must play in Bundesliga to reach full potential
But that does not mean Wood hasn't put himself in a very good situation with Union Berlin. For one, he is the youngest player to be near the top of the 2.Bundesliga scoring leaders in a long time, but it's also important to remember Wood lost nearly two years of his development after suffering a meniscus injury in 2011. He suffered several reoccurrences and complications while trying to comeback, and it wasn't until 2013 that he was able to play for a consistent period of time.
Combined with a fallout with his 1860 Munich coach in 2014 and 2015 – something that reduced him to the bench for several months – Wood has had a difficult time coming into his own. His current season at Union Berlin (Wood's first with the club since leaving Erzgebirge Aue last summer) is his first as a regular starter. He has played 2274 minutes for Union, but before this season, he had played just 2421 minutes in the 2.Bundesliga in his entire career, one that dates back to his debut with 1860 Munich in 2011.

So while many previous 2.Bundesliga leading scorers had career years and used that to move to a bigger league, Wood is doing so in his first real test.
Thomas Rongen was the U.S. U-20 head coach during the 2011 cycle and recalls first seeing Wood by accident when he was in Germany scouting dual-national players. Wood had joined 1860 Munich's academy in 2007 at the age of 15 after playing for a top California youth team, the Irvine Strikers. Rongen was in Munich to watch a young Julian Green but stuck around an extra day to watch Wood.
The next two years are more critical. He will get to a Bundesliga team. Can he become a starter, first and foremost? If he does, can he become a guy who can consistently score goals? The jury is still out, to be honest." - Thomas Rongen
“He was an interesting guy,” Rongen said of his initial impressions of Wood. “Strong but not tall. He had a low center of gravity. He was equally good with his left and right foot. He had above average feet, I would say … He lacked, in my opinion, the tactical acumen, so to speak, to be very effective at that time. But he's obviously gotten better.”
“[Wood's success] doesn't surprise me,” he added. “You could clearly tell he was a talented player.”
Rongen is not alone. Amobi Okugo was Wood's teammate on the U-20 team, and the two also knew each other from the Olympic Development Program in Southern California.
“To be honest, I'm not too surprised (at Wood's success),” Okugo said. “He had all the talent, he's just finally putting it all together. I think his injuries were very unfortunate, with the timing of them, but now he's got a good run of consistent games, and is doing well. He wasn't great at finishing back then, but that's all changed.”
If the talent has always there to succeed at this level, one question remains: Where does Wood go in the future? Based on the history of those in his situation, all signs point to a Bundesliga move. He is the third-leading scorer in the second division, and the two ahead of him are four and five years older. There is a chance he could finish with 20 goals this season, an amount that hasn't been reached in that league since 2010/11.
The safe bet is a move to a lower-table Bundesliga team, since that seems to be the market value for a top 2.Bundesliga striker. Earlier in the week, German publication Bild reported Hamburg SV had scouts in attendance over the weekend to watch Wood's game-winning goal in Union's 1-0 win over Heidenheim.
Whether Hamburg makes an offer for Wood remains to be seen, but the club is at the historical level for Wood's next destination (HSV is currently in 12th in the 18-team Bundesliga). As for whether Wood will succeed in the Bundesliga or another top league, that remains to be seen.
Rongen stresses the next challenge will be a steep one for his former player.
“He'll move on,” the Dutch-born Rongen said. “But to me, the 2.Bundesliga and the Bundesliga, and I'm very familiar with German football, there's a huge, huge [difference]. With all due respect, it's like going from the USL or the NASL to the MLS. How many players have made an impact in MLS after they've been dubbed a little bit of a star in USL and NASL? It's few and far between.
STEVE DAVIS Jermaine Jones and the intangibles of influencing matches
“Yes, he's done well, but to me, the next two years are more critical. He will get to a Bundesliga team. Can he become a starter, first and foremost? There are a lot of good players up front for any Bundesliga team. If he does, can he become a guy who can consistently score goals? The jury is still out, to be honest.”
Wood's success might be with an average 2.Bundesliga team, but in terms of American players, that still puts him among the top echelon of forwards based either abroad or domestically. He will certainly be an important player for Jurgen Klinsmann for the Copa America Centenario.
As is his way, Klinsmann wants Wood seek a higher level.
"The first league has to be his goal," Klinsmann told Hamburger Morgenpost. "He's not a national team player by mistake. Bobby is young and has great plans. I can very well imagine he can have his breakthrough."
Klinsmann is typically optimistic when publically discussing his player's prospects, but Rongen is correct. The next two years will tell the story of whether Wood will become another stalwart goal scorer.
Right now, he is at a crossroads, but he's trending in the right direction. That makes him one of the most interesting players to watch heading into this summer's competition.
Here is a young woman who made a video called “How I knew I was non binary.”
Since this is the title of the video, I think it's reasonable to assume that the things she talks about in her video are the reasons why she knew she was non binary. This is what she talks about in her video:
In fifth grade, a girl called her legs “gross” because she hadn't shaved them, and she didn't understand why her legs were gross. She hadn't even reached puberty yet.
In middle school there was strong policing of gender by her peers and she felt depressed. She knew it was ridiculous to try and fit in by being as girly as she could, however, this is what she did.
A girl she knew put on lip gloss to kiss a boy she had a crush on but she didn't like wearing that kind of lip gloss. (However in the video she has lipstick on, so….?)
She got up early in the morning to style her hair and do her makeup because she felt she had to do this to fit in. She considers compliments about her hair to be signs of “fitting in.” However, she didn't feel like herself while doing this.
One day, she cut her hair short and wore androgynous clothes, and her mother expressed her disapproval because people might think she's a boy. She thought it was okay if people thought she was a boy.
She remembers being happier and more extroverted when she was young enough that people hadn't started policing her appearance.
In senior high school, she wanted to throw out all her girls' clothes and buy all boys' clothes, but she was dating a jerk boyfriend and wanted his approval, so she “pretended to be a girl.”
She felt validated while reading Tumblr posts about non binary.
Wow! Based on this information, being non binary means being a whole, unique person with a distinct personality who doesn't meet the shallow, limiting criteria for behavior set by middle school kids. According to this explanation, I'm non binary and so are every person I've ever gotten along with, because we've also never met the dumb expectations of the popular clique. But I don't call myself non binary, because I don't think that's a useful way to describe what's happening here.
Non binary identity is an attempt to identify outside of your actual sex in order to avoid having sex-related stereotypes placed on you by other people. It's not just a synonym for androgynous, which would make some sense, but instead it's supposed to imply that the sex of your body doesn't exist and you are neither male nor female (despite not actually having an intersex condition.) Actually, if non binary was a synonym for intersex, that would probably make more sense—if you didn't have the usual sex characteristics that males and females come with 99% of the time, then “non binary” could describe that. But non binary is not about physical sex characteristics, it's about the social gender role.
In this video, the young woman talks mostly about having her appearance policed by other people, (her peers and her mother,) and them wanting her to meet their current definition of how girls and women should look. This is a totally normal experience that girls go through as they're growing up. Depending on how much sexism there is among the people they grow up around, girl children are taught to varying degrees that girls have to look a certain way in order to be acceptable. If a girl is lucky, and her family and peers are not sexist, then she'll be allowed to be herself. But if her family and peers are sexist, as many people are, then they'll teach her that she absolutely must look feminine or else she's a failure as a human being. That's what happened with the woman in this video. Her peers were very sexist, and it sounds like her mother was too, and that led to her feeling like she needed to style her hair and wear makeup in order to be acceptable, even though she didn't feel like herself when engaging in these behaviours.
There are lots of reasons why kids and teens are sexist. They learn it from their families, their religions and the media, and a few developmental characteristics makes them very keen on enforcing the rules they've learned. Kids and teens are unsure of themselves and very concerned about fitting in. Since they are immature they haven't developed the ability to find their self-worth from within, and they try to find it through superficial signs of acceptance from their peers. They don't have well developed social skills and so they engage in bullying and other anti-social behaviours. Boys learn that they have to behave in domineering and aggressive ways in order to be acceptable as boys, and they enforce this on each other. Girls learn that they have to be pretty and pleasing to boys, and they enforce this on other girls. These sexist attitudes come directly from patriarchy, which all children are socialized into.
Lesbian and bisexual women are very likely not to fit the feminine gender role, since it's entirely based on heterosexuality. However, there are also straight women who don't fit into femininity. There are plenty of straight women who don't feel comfortable being limited in life to wife and mother and having her whole existence center around pleasing her man. The reason why there has been a feminist movement going on for decades now is because large numbers of women don't identify with the sexist expectations placed on us and the limited role reserved for us in patriarchy.
This particular “non binary” woman is attracted to men and eager for their approval, and she is struggling to find a balance between pleasing men and staying true to herself. Surely this is a common experience among all women who are attracted to men, especially when they are in high school.
When I see young women who are going through the normal experience of having their appearance policed by high school peers and believing this makes them literally not female, I realize that navigating a sexist, heteronormative high school social environment is just as difficult as ever and yet we are farther away from helping girls navigate it than we used to be. All these same things happened to me when I was in school. The girls around me had arbitrary, silly, nonsensical, strongly-held beliefs that I was supposed to wear certain clothes, listen to certain music, and say certain things, and if I messed up it was their job to punish me for my transgression. It was terrifying and confusing for me because no one ever explained to me ahead of time what the rules were, and I never knew I was breaking one until the punishment came. Completely random things, like a zipper being in the wrong spot on a pair of pants, or a jacket being “too shiny,” were cause for belittling people.
When I was in high school there was a different word for those of us who didn't understand the social rules and couldn't follow them. We called ourselves “outsiders.” We may have gotten this word from the excellent young adult book The Outsiders, actually. Whatever vocabulary young people are given to explain their experiences is the vocabulary they will use. In the 1990s, nobody was telling us that if we didn't fit in with the popular clique then our biological sex didn't exist and we had to take on a “gender identity.” The experience of not fitting it hasn't changed a bit, but the way we conceive of our differences has changed into something totally nonsensical.
There are a few things that I would tell my younger self, to help her navigate the strange and scary world of middle and high school, based on my adult knowledge of the world. The first thing I'd tell her is that social skills aren't what she thinks they are. I used to think that social skills meant being “cool” and popular, and knowing how to do and say the right things to not get made fun of. Now that I'm an adult, I know that I had good social skills all along, but my peers did not. I knew how to treat people with respect, honour differences, appreciate a person for her personality rather than her appearance, and be kind to my friends. The kids at my school who were bullies were the ones with poor social skills. They didn't know how to get along with other people, they were shallow and superficial and mean. They needed to be taught better how to interact with their peers.
The second thing I'd tell my younger self is that it was good that I didn't meet the dumb criteria set by the girls at school. It was good that I wasn't so shallow that I thought clothing had to only be the latest styles by designer brands, and it was good that I didn't make rude, snappy comebacks and put people down, because that doesn't make you cool, it makes you an asshole, and it was good that I had interests in arts and culture and the humanities, even though this made me “nerdy” when I was young. All the things about me that the bullies didn't like were the things that would make me the person I am, make me proud of myself as an adult, and save my life over and over. My interest in the arts has always been the thing that keeps me from being suicidal. It's been the main thing that makes sense to me in life and the thing that makes me feel the joy of human existence. It was good that nobody managed to bully that wonderful blessing out of me.
I would then explain to my younger self that superficial approval from my peers in the form of them liking my clothes or hair didn't actually consist of a meaningful friendship. Further, the people who are really shallow and superficial were not even capable of meaningful friendship. The deep friendships I had with a small number of other nerdy girls were worth thousands of times more than the superficial approval from shallow assholes that I kept craving.
I would also explain to my younger self that the reason I didn't think I needed an expensive salon haircut and a push-up bra starting at age 13 is because I was a feminist who resisted being a sex object for men and who saw herself as a fully human person. This was a positive thing about me. One of the reasons I found a lot of my female peers' behavior baffling is because I was a lesbian and I didn't think the same way they did. I didn't have this sophisticated understanding back then, but I had an instinct that being overly sexualized and dressed up was not for me, and didn't make much sense for anybody. Those girls who were 13-going-on-20 were groomed by a sexist culture and they were entering dangerous territory. Some of them were hurt while trying to please boys in these shallow ways.
High school girls who don't fit in with the popular clique don't need a gender identity label, they need to be taught how to navigate bullying and sexism. They need to understand that this sort of bullying has been happening for a long time, at least several decades, and maybe since time immemorial, and their mothers dealt with it too. They need to understand what positive values and good social skills are and identify bullies and sexism as the problems. They need to understand that their natural personalities are not a problem and don't cancel out their womanhood in any way, because women do in fact have a variety of personalities. Girls and women who resist sexist expectations are normal girls and women, and if they need to be given any sort of label, a really useful label would be feminist. Girls who take on a gender identity label are not exempt from sexist expectations, because they are still female and sexist expectations are enforced based on sex, not internally-felt identities.
The main thing the feminist movement has taught me is that trying to identify your way out of oppression by claiming to be “not like the other girls” doesn't work as a strategy. The strategy that will work to end sexism and female oppression is the strategy of making structural changes to society so that women are freed from being sex objects for men. As long as women are oppressed based on our sex, we will be targeted for misogyny, regardless of how we feel we identify. The more steps we make toward the goal of ending patriarchy, the fewer girls there will be who feel extreme discomfort when they're expected to meet the demands of femininity, which is literally the social role created to keep us subordinate to men.

Getty Trump blames Romney for super PAC attacks
Donald Trump took a swipe at Mitt Romney on Wednesday night, complaining to a TV interviewer that the 2012 Republican nominee was attacking him via a new super PAC formed for that purpose.
Trump, speaking to Fox News host Greta Van Susteren, was asked about Our Principles, the group run by former top Romney aide Katie Packer that has been running ads portraying him as a fake conservative.
Story Continued Below
“They are all aiming at me, I guess, and that's fine. And so far, it‘s been only driving my numbers up. They should have devoted more time to Mitt Romney and helped him win instead of looking at, you know, taking other people down,” Trump said.
“And now Romney is doing a PAC, because Romney feels badly, because frankly that was an election that he should have won,” he continued.
Our Principles, which is not associated with Romney, launched just before the Iowa caucuses and spent $2.5 million on ads attacking Trump there. The group is now planning a media blitz in South Carolina.
“Four years ago, they should have won that election easily and they failed. So these people that — these ex-Romney people should have focused more on getting Romney elected instead of doing super PACs,” Trump said.

TRENTON -- After months of arguments and uncertainty, Gov. Chris Christie's administration on Wednesday was granted the authority to immediately seize control of financially distressed Atlantic City.
The state Local Finance Board voted 5-0 to approve a state takeover of the local government in the seaside gambling resort -- an effort Christie says is the best way to keep the city from becoming the first New Jersey municipality since 1938 to go bankrupt.
The decision gives the state the power to assume key functions usually controlled by local leaders for up to five years. That includes renegotiating union contracts, hiring and firing employees, selling city assets, reversing decisions of the city council, and more.
The city becomes the first to municipality to be taken over by the state since Camden in 2002.
Read Atlantic City's recovery proposal
"This is definitely a sad day in the history of Atlantic City," City Council President Marty Small said after the vote.
Mayor Don Guardian had said in recent days that if the takeover was approved, the city would challenge the move in court.
But on Wednesday, he said city officials will hold off on such a move until they talk more with the state.
"I think everything is on the table," he said. "We have to see how cooperative (the state is)."
Five casinos have closed in Atlantic City since 2014, causing the city's tax base to plummet and blowing a $100 million hole in its budget. The 39,000-resident city is also more than $500 million in debt.
Christie, state lawmakers, and local leaders have bickered since January about how to help the city. The Republican governor ended up signing a rescue package in May that gave local officials 150 days to come up with a five-year recovery plan. The state could impose a takeover if the plan was rejected.
The state Department of Community Affairs shot down the city's proposal last week. The Local Finance Board then voted Wednesday to finalize the takeover.
The only power the board did not grant the state was the ability to file for bankruptcy on behalf of the city.
Timothy Cunningham, director of the department's Division of Local Government Services, will oversee the takeover. He said he wasn't certain what duties the mayor and council will retain, calling the move "unchartered territory."
"It's an unbelievable responsibility -- one I lost sleep over last the couple of days heading into this," Cunningham said of the difficulty of the scenario. "And I'm sure I'm going to lose sleep tonight."
Ted Light, a board member, said the vote was not an easy one.
"It almost makes you feel you've got to be a god to do these things, and I'm not a god," Light said. "But you have to make the decisions you feel are best."
The state alresdy has oversight in Atlantic City. In 2010, Christie announced the state would take over the city's tourism district and also installed a state monitor. In 2015, the governor appointed an emergency management team there. But the takeover expands the state's role.
One of the key developments now will be what happens to the city's Municipal Utilities Authority, which provides residents water. Guardian said Wednesday he believes the authority was the biggest reason the state pursued a takeover. Critics have feared Christie's administration could seek to privatize it.
Lena Smith of Food & Water Watch, advocacy group that opposed the takeover, said in a statement Wednesday that the takeover "is about denying the people a voice in their own future, and the likely handover of a precious asset -- the city's water system -- to private corporations" close to Christie, state Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester), and Democratic south Jersey powerbroker George Norcross III.
But Wall Street Credit rating agency Moody's Investor Services issued a statement after the vote saying the takeover a "credit positive move" because the state now has the ability to make the city's debt payments due Dec. 1 and 15.
"We will watch developments closely to determine how they will impact the city and the city's Municipal Utilities Authority," Doug Goldmacher, an analyst at the agency said.
And the city appears to find hope in some good else. The vote comes a day after Republican Donald Trump was elected America's president. Christie, one of Trump's top advisers, could be given a post in the new administration, forcing him to resign as governor.
That would mean Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno would succeed Christie.
Asked if Guadagno would be better for the city's situation, Guardian responded: "What do you think?"
Brian Murray, a spokesman for Christie's office, deferred comment to the Department of Community Affairs.
Steve Young, a community activist in the city, actually invoked Trump's election as a reason to vote against the takeover.
"This is an example of what this country could turn out to be under Chris Christie and President-Elect Donald Trump, taking away our rights and sovereignty," Young told the board. "Who do we talk to as residents? What will government look like with the state of New Jersey overpowering the residents? We are headed for some bad times, and your city could be next."

Image caption Mike Logan made the claims on the BBC's Spotlight programme on Tuesday night
Police are to reinvestigate claims that the Provisional IRA bought guns from America and smuggled them into Northern Ireland in the late 1990s.
It follows a BBC Spotlight programme that alleged a senior member of Sinn Féin was involved in a gun-running operation from Florida.
A self-confessed gun-runner told the programme Sean 'Spike' Murray was involved in smuggling guns before and after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.
Mr Murray has denied the allegations.
The senior Sinn Féin strategist described the claims made in the programme as "without foundation".
'Hundreds of guns'
The accusation was made by gun-runner Mike Logan, a former stockbroker based in Florida.
During Tuesday night's broadcast, Mr Logan told BBC Spotlight that Mr Murray had been his main contact in Belfast and had been involved in ordering hundreds of guns.
Mr Logan claimed the firearms were smuggled into Northern Ireland over a five-year period, including a period when the IRA was involved in weapons decommissioning talks.
The Irish American said he had been given immunity from prosecution by the US authorities in return for giving them information about the weapons he had collected.
On the day after the BBC programme was broadcast, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) confirmed it had reopened its investigation in the case.
In a statement, a PSNI spokeswoman said: "PIRA gun running from Florida is now subject to reinvestigation which will include an examination of existing evidence together with the examination of any potential new evidence that has come to light in the last few days."
Earlier on Wednesday, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) met senior police officers to discuss the revelations.
Convictions
DUP minister Arlene Foster called on police to reveal if they were aware of claims that a senior member of Sinn Féin was involved in buying and smuggling weapons from America.
Ms Foster said: "It doesn't really matter whether Sinn Féin dismiss the claims from last night's programme.
"What we want to know now is whether the police were made aware of the information that the individual (Mike Logan) from America gave last night and if they weren't aware, why were they not aware."
The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) had also urged the PSNI to investigate the allegations made in the broadcast "as a matter of urgency".
The UUP's justice spokesperson, Tom Elliott, has written to the PSNI chief constable to express his concerns about the weapons claims.
In 1999, four people were arrested in Florida and subsequently convicted of gun-running.
One of the most prescient dystopian science fiction films of the 1980′s turned out to be the (direct to video?) 1987 movie, “Cherry 2000.”
The future depicted in Cherry 2000 is one where sexual encounters and relationships with real women have become complicated legal transactions requiring lawyers, and have been reduced to merely emotionless business arrangements. The women are typically aggressive, masculine, demanding and shrill. It leads to an environment where the rare romantic guy, who still longs for a traditional loving relationship, would actually find a courtship with a female android more emotionally fulfilling than one with a real live organic woman. It's sort of a more sympathetic, less horrific spin on “The Stepford Wives” theme. In Stepford, the men killed their loving yet sassy wives in exchange for robot sex slaves who would do the dishes and clean the house without giving them any grief. They were portrayed unmistakably as as evil pricks. In contrast, the physically human women are the ones who display the robotic behavior in Cherry 2000, while the romantic men are forced to seek out the loving emulation of androids for any “meaningful” companionship. Of course the film sells out in the end, as the main character who sacrifices everything in a dangerous quest to replace his beloved, short circuited fembot(Cherry, played by Pamela Gidley) with the identical discontinued model, ultimately falls for the crass and bitchy, tomboyish tracker, “Edith”(Melanie Griffith) whom he's hired to help locate the robot.
With the advent of “yes means” laws it doesn't seem like it will be long before men will be required to get some type of verbally recorded or written consent to engage in sexual activity with a seemingly “turned on” girl, to shield themselves from litigation or criminal prosecution if she turns on them later. As if getting a girl pregnant or contracting an STD wasn't enough to worry about, now we have bigger fish to fry. Indeed, there is already a phone app for sexual consent, called Good2Go.
Recent developments over the past two decades have leaded me to conclude we're headed towards Cherry 2000 style dating in America. Indeed, I've started to notice that the crudely annoying spambots on Tinder and Okcupid have been getting more sophisticated in their programming to the point where interacting with them can be more romantically stimulating than talking to actual chicks(which, if you've ever had an unfortunate exchange with one of these Tinderbots you would realize is more of a knock on the sorry state of the 21st century female conversational experience than it is one marveling in wonder at the advancements in artificial intelligence spam.)
Then there are video game characters. Back in a particularly isolated time period of my life in 2001 and 2002, when all I did was drink diet pepsi, eat microwave popcorn and play old Super Nintendo RPGs in my studio apartment, I would occasionally develop what I guess you could call “crushes” on some of the female sprites in the games(such as Rydia from Final Fantasy IV, Marle and Schala from Chrono Trigger, Paula from Earthbound, etc.) even to where I began to curiously research the technological possibilities of transferring human consciousness to a computer. I was thinking of course that if i could somehow hack a sprite that resembled me into the game's ROM, that it might be possible to get something going. Yeah, it's crazy but so what? Realized dreams are the work of madmen. I also saw Tron in the theater when I was a kid so perhaps it left a subconscious impression on me.
In any case, if that kind of emotion was possible to evoke in the days of 16 bit SNES pixelation, I can only imagine how real a romance could be in the context of modern video games which are now much more advanced in their elaborate overworlds, roleplays and simulations. Thousands if not millions of men and women find the virtual experience of video games more appealing than going outside and playing. It would be naive to think that organic human love would be any less vulnerable to competition from artificial intelligence than other components of our earthly existence.
Dust off your 1980′s JC Penney catalog and get your fembots on order, men! This scene is coming to a nightclub or campus near you.

Teenager agrees to 20-year sentence
Seth Andrew Yates, 16, pleas guilty on first-degree murder charges before District Judge Carmen Kelsey, Monday, March 19, 2012. As part of the plea agreement, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Yates killed retired U.S. Army sergeant George Michael Iser, 59, in April 2011. Iser was stabbed more than 40 times with a steak knife in his apartment at the 2600 block of Nacogdoches Road. The word, "Fag" was written in blood on a note left by the body. He was found to be sufficiently sophisticated and was treated as an adult during a hearing in July 2011. less Seth Andrew Yates, 16, pleas guilty on first-degree murder charges before District Judge Carmen Kelsey, Monday, March 19, 2012.

A straight-A student who told police he repeatedly stabbed a stranger who was trying to molest him — then wrote a gay slur in blood from his wounded pinky and pinned the paper to the man's genitals with a steak knife — agreed to a 20-year prison sentence Monday after prosecutors challenged his self-defense claim.
Seth Andrew Yates, 16, was a ninth-grader who had shown signs of troubling behavior before he was arrested last April after police followed a trail of blood from the apartment of retired Army sergeant George Michael Izer, 59, to the teen's nearby home.
Izer was found in his living room with his pants around his ankles and gay porn playing on his TV. He had been stabbed more than 100 times in a “ritualistic” fashion — many of the wounds focusing on his abdomen and groin and many incurred postmortem — attorneys said. His neck was also slit.
Yates, who pleaded guilty to murder, initially told police he met Izer that night after he had been mugged by another stranger. He said he was semiconscious from the beating and that he thought Izer was going to help him but woke up later on the man's couch as he was being touched inappropriately.
Remembering he had a pocket knife on his belt, he stabbed Izer once in the stomach but was grabbed around the neck as he tried to leave, he told police in a written statement.
“So, I don't know, I took the knife and stuck it in the side of his neck. ... I dragged the knife all the way across and then he pretty much quit,” Yates, then 15, wrote. “I freaked out. ... There was a lot of blood. Then I stabbed him another 10 times to make sure he was dead.”
Knowing that Izer had stopped breathing, Yates said he continued to stab the man out of anger, focusing on the upper body and crotch.
“Then I saw a piece of paper sitting by his TV and I just thought I would notify passers-by, whoever found him, why he died,” Yates wrote. “On the paper I wrote, ‘Fag.' ... I was going to write ‘child molester' but it was too painful to finish.”
But there was a large discrepancy in Yates' story that led authorities to realize he wasn't being completely truthful. Video surveillance from a Shell gas station near their Northeast Side homes showed the two meeting shortly before the slaying, Yates uninjured and loitering. He appeared to voluntarily walk off with Izer.
The teen's guilty plea shows that he, too, knew it wasn't self-defense, said Jill Mata, chief of the district attorney's juvenile prosecution unit.
“There are definitely some special circumstances” that led to the plea deal, she said, adding that authorities still don't know exactly what happened in the apartment. “We know there was likely some expectation of sexual contact there. Regardless of whether (Yates) went willingly or not, he was underage.”
The gas station video would have been one of the most difficult issues to overcome had the case gone to trial, defense attorney John Paul Young said after the hearing, adding that neither he nor his client was ecstatic by the sentence but thought it was fair. Yates will have to serve at least half of it before applying for parole.
Yates did not have a criminal history, but at a July court hearing, juvenile probation officer Traci Geppert described him as “very intelligent.” He had attended Highlands High School for most of the year before transferring to MacArthur High about a month before the slaying and was in classes for gifted students, according to court documents.
Previous teachers and administrators noted his outspokenness, such as refusing to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, Geppert said.
“He'd say whatever he wanted with others around and with no regard for what others felt,” she testified then.
Authorities also described Yates' admittance to a psychiatric hospital in Billings, Mont., in August 2009, after physical aggression toward his mother and threats to kill her boyfriend. His father is serving time in prison, prosecutors said.

Barbara Comstock, the Republican nominee in Virginia's 10th Congressional District, recently appeared before an audience of Korean Americans in Tysons Corner, the kind of gathering the GOP is targeting as it seeks to revive the party in the commonwealth and beyond.
When it was her turn to speak, Comstock packed virtually every sentence with a reference to Koreans, including her work with the Korean Chamber of Commerce, that “many” Korean churches are in her district, and that she enjoys attending the annual Korean American festival.
“You always have a seat at the table with the Republican Party,” said Comstock, a state delegate who represents Fairfax County, as audience members applauded politely.
Ever since the GOP lost the 2012 presidential election, Republicans have sought to broaden their appeal beyond the white suburban voters who have long constituted the party's base.
Although Republicans view their quest as national in scope, much effort is focused on Fairfax, Manassas and Loudoun County — Washington suburbs in the 10th where the Latino and Asian populations have ballooned in recent years.
View Graphic Asians, Hispanics are key minorities in Virginia's 10th District
With the GOP's most conservative voices opposing immigration reform and the federal health-care law — issues of great importance to Latinos and Asians — Republicans acknowledge the challenges they face in appealing to those groups.
Their goal, at least initially, is to chip away at Democratic dominance. In the process, they envision another benefit: making the party more attractive to moderate white voters repelled by the image of Republicans as unwelcoming to minorities, immigrants, gays and women.
“The spinoff is that other voters — swing and moderates — like inclusive and optimistic candidates,” said former congressman Thomas Davis III, known for his ties to Asians in Northern Virginia's 11th Congressional District. “They don't like people who are polarizing.”
Chris LaCivita, a Republican strategist, said, “To not have a minority outreach strategy is to not have a campaign. We may not win 51 percent of the Hispanic vote but, hey, can we win 30 percent? You can never get to 50 if you don't start somewhere.”
Making a connection
A slice of Virginia that stretches west through Loudoun, Clarke and Frederick counties, two-thirds of the 10th District is white, while Hispanics and Asians each account for 11 percent. The district, which also includes portions of Fairfax and Prince William counties, is thick with rural and suburban Republican enclaves that have drawn Comstock's attention.
On July 4, while her volunteers attended a festival in Manassas, home to a growing Latino community, Comstock was in Clifton, which is 98 percent white, marching in the town's parade while members of her entourage sang “God Bless America.”
Yet Comstock, who is facing Democrat John Foust in the Nov. 4 general election, has also made sure to advertise her appearances before Korean and Indian audiences. She touts her legislative efforts on their behalf even as advocates say she has supported measures that are anti-immigrant.

The “Comstock Connection,” her newsletter, is rife with blurbs describing her attendance at events such as the Punjabi Mela Festival, a celebration of Indian and Pakistani culture; and the 50th anniversary celebration of the Organization of Korean American Women.
The newsletter also highlighted the first celebration of the Korean Bell Garden in Vienna, a new attraction she said she was “thrilled” to have in her district when she spoke to the gathering of Korean Americans in Tysons earlier this month.
Sponsored by the RNC, the event — held at Woo Lae Oak, a restaurant that is a pillar of Northern Virginia's Korean community — is the kind of grass-roots affair the party is seeking to host around the country.
“Good to see you,” Comstock said repeatedly as she visited tables while an aide shot photos of her with Korean guests that were later posted on Twitter and Facebook. At one point, the candidate conferred with Harold Pyon, a Korean civic leader who could be heard teaching Comstock to say “How are you?” in Korean.
Whether Comstock's efforts add up to votes is unknown.
Tae Kim, 75, a retired computer operator who sat at a table with his wife, said he has split his votes between the two parties, supporting President Obama, but then Republican Ken Cuccinelli II for governor.
On his jacket, he wore a “Comstock for Congress” sticker, but he cautioned against drawing conclusions about his allegiance. “Some lady gave it to me,” he said of the sticker. At the moment, he said, he is undecided.
Asian voters
In 1992, when Bill Clinton won the presidency, polls showed that two-thirds of Asians voted for Republican George H.W. Bush. Twenty years later, Obama won two-thirds of the Asian vote.
The swing in Asian support is the most dramatic of any voting bloc in the country, according to academics, and is rooted in a number of factors, beginning with Asians settling in Democratic strongholds such as New York and California. Clinton also helped draw Asians by courting their community during his presidency.
But Asians also abandoned the GOP after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus felt discriminated against by the Patriot Act, the anti-terrorism law drafted by a Republican senator and embraced by President George W. Bush.
Their sense of estrangement was exacerbated by the emergence of Christian conservatives within the GOP who made immigrants feel unwelcome, said Karthick Ramakrishan, a political science professor at the University of California at Riverside who directs the National Survey of Asian Americans.
“If you had asked me three years ago if it could get any worse, I would've said it can't,” Ramakrishan said of the GOP's standing among Asians. “But it did. They need to stop the bleeding.”
Obama even dominated the Vietnamese vote, Ramakrishan said, a community that had traditionally supported the GOP because of its opposition to communism. “That showed you how bad off the Republicans had gotten,” he said.
After Obama's reelection, the Republican National Committee issued a report concluding that Republicans “need to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian, and gay Americans and demonstrate that we care about them.”
The RNC hired liaisons to those communities, including Jason Chung, a veteran of Virginia politics, to appeal to Asians. His duties include encouraging Republicans nationwide to attend churches and special events such as festivals in immigrant communities. “A lot of complaints I heard in years past is that Republicans and Democrats just show up before the election,” he said. “We're trying to create national exposure at the local level.”
Raynard Jackson, a Republican strategist who is African American, has been critical of the party's outreach to blacks. Jackson lauded the RNC's hiring of outreach workers, but he said that Republicans' Senate and House staffs remain overwhelmingly white.
“A major deficiency,” Jackson said. “How can you go into a black community and you're surrounded by a bunch of white staffers? The optics don't match your rhetoric.”
In addition, the GOP's ability to draw groups such as Latinos is undermined by leaders opposing immigration reform, even as prominent Republicans such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona have preached compromise.
Edgar Aranda-Yanoc, of the nonpartisan Virginia Coalition of Latino Organizations, said immigration issues create a “challenge” for Republicans seeking Latino votes. “It is something the Republicans have to work at,” he said.
Receptive to message
Among immigrant groups, Republicans view Asians as among the most potentially receptive to their message, if only because surveys have shown that they do not feel aligned with either party.
At the same time, surveys have shown that Asians support immigration reform and universal health care and prefer traditional Democratic touchstones such as a big, activist government.
If nothing else, Asians present an opportunity nationally because their population increased 43 percent between 2000 and 2010, equaling the growth of Latinos. In Loudoun, a centerpiece of the 10th, the Asian population grew from 5.3 percent to 14.7 percent.
State Del. David Ramadan (R), an Arab whose district includes Loudoun, won reelection in an area won by Obama. He attributed his success, in part, to relationships he has cultivated by attending Indian and Pakistani festivals, block parties and religious services.
“When I walk into an Indian temple, I am received as if I'm Indian — why?” Ramadan said. “Because I've spent years building those relationships. We are an example to the rest of the state and the rest of the country.”
Comstock, too, has assisted immigrant communities. But some say she has supported measures in the General Assembly that can be seen as onerous to immigrants. One bill requires non-English-speaking defendants convicted of criminal offenses to pay for translation services. Another requires police to ask arrestees if they are in the country legally. A third authorized the State Board of Elections to verify that registered voters are U.S. citizens.
“There's a well-documented pattern over the last several years of Comstock voting or taking positions on bills that are consistently unfriendly to immigrants,” said John Liss, co-executive director of Virginia New Majority, which organizes low-income and immigrant communities.
Asked about her record on immigration issues in Richmond, Johanna Persing, a Comstock spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail that the delegate “has worked on many jobs, small business, education and quality of life issues vital to their communities.”
As examples, Persing cited Comstock's support of anti-human-trafficking legislation and tax relief for the tech sector, which “has many immigrant and first generation entrepreneurs in our area.”
Comstock also voted to require that textbooks in Virginia schools note that the Sea of Japan is also known as the East Sea, an issue of significance to Koreans who recall Japan's imperial rule.
Six days after that vote, Comstock's newsletter included a photograph of the delegate with an Asian woman, the two of them holding a sign saying “Vote Yes” on the bill. The accompanying blurb noted that Comstock was a “co-patron” on the legislation, which is an “important issue for the entire Korean American community.”
Uzbekistan's plan to build a new rail line linking Tashkent to the Fergana Valley would mean eliminating the current international route through Tajikistan, which has relied on roughly $25 million a year in transit fees. Following the break up of the Soviet Union, Tajikistan's rail lines have become marginalized and underutilized, such as this abandoned track in Tajikistan's Sughd Province. (Photo: David Trilling)
Tajiks are worrying that an Uzbek plan to build a new railway bypassing Tajikistan will further isolate their country, increasing hardship in the region's poorest state.
The new railway would link Tashkent to Uzbekistan's densely populated Ferghana Valley regions via the 2,200-meter Kamchik Pass. Once completed, Uzbek authorities could abandon use of a Soviet-era, 110-kilometer-long spur that cuts across Tajikistan's northern Sughd Province. Uzbekistan is already shipping freight to and from the Ferghana Valley by road, only using the international rail route for moving oil and petroleum products. Uzbekistan reportedly pays about $25 million a year in transit fees to Tajikistan – so the new rail link would deal Dushanbe a considerable economic blow.
Quoting Uzbekistan Railways Chief Engineer Khusniddin Khosilov, the privately owned podrobno.uz news website reported last April that the company had already drafted a proposal for a $1.9-billion electric railway line stretching 129 kilometers from Angren, in the Tashkent Region, to Pop in the Namangan Region. According to regional media reports, a feasibility study is expected to be completed this year, and construction – paid for by Uzbekistan Railways, the Uzbek government and loans from “international financial institutions" – is expected to commence next year. Reports have not specified which “international financial institutions” might be involved.
Neither Uzbekistan Railways nor the Asian Development Bank (which has financed a number of transport projects in Uzbekistan) responded to EurasiaNet.org's repeated requests for comment.
The project is not the first time Uzbekistan has taken action to untangle its rail lines. Since gaining independence in 1991, Uzbekistan has built over 1,000 kilometers of new track to circumvent lines that passed through Turkmenistan.
Construction of the Kamchik Pass project is expected to take five years. The line's economic importance would be boosted if it becomes part of a long-stalled Chinese project to construct a railway linking Kashgar in western China's Xinjiang Province with the eastern Uzbek city of Andijan via Kyrgyzstan, turning Uzbekistan into a railway hub linking China and Afghanistan, and possibly Iran. Some Tajik media outlets have expressed concern about China's decision to proceed with a rail link via Uzbekistan and not Tajikistan: they fear this could have severe economic consequences for Dushanbe.
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have the most acrimonious bilateral relationship in Central Asia. The chief source of tension is Tajikistan's plans to build the world's largest hydropower dam, Rogun. Designed by Soviet engineers, and stalled by the Soviet breakup in 1991, the dam would help Tajikistan become energy independent, Dushanbe says. Downstream, Tashkent vigorously opposes the Rogun project, insisting it would hurt its agricultural sector by limiting water flows. Thanks to Rogun, and visible antipathy between presidents Islam Karimov and Imomali Rahmon, the two countries are hardly on speaking terms. Last year, Karimov warned, without naming Tajikistan, that such dam projects could lead to a regional war.
Central Asia observers believe that Uzbekistan's bid to acquire transport independence may further strain bilateral relations. “The line will give Uzbekistan the economic independence from Tajikistan it craves, and will allow it to increase its leverage over its neighbor," Alice Mummery, a Central Asia analyst at the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), told EurasiaNet.org. "Although it hasn't commented publicly, Tajikistan is likely highly concerned that the new rail line will leave it even more exposed to the whims of Uzbekistan."
Rashid Gani Abdullo, a Dushanbe-based political analyst, said Uzbekistan's desire to reduce its rail dependence on Tajikistan is understandable because “the less you depend, the less vulnerable you become.” But that leaves Tajikistan in a bind: Dushanbe “should be concerned with solving the issue of diversifying its access to transnational railway networks,” Abdullo told EurasiaNet.org.
The new Uzbek line will have “mostly unfavorable” consequences for both countries, Abdullo maintained. “For Uzbekistan this is extra costs, although, possibly, the construction of the new line will help economic development in areas alongside it. For Tajikistan, this is the loss of transit fees, at a minimum.”
Transport independence will likely prompt Tashkent to bring additional pressure to bear on Dushanbe in ongoing water and energy disputes, suggested Mummery. “The risk of freight blockades against Tajikistan will increase if Dushanbe insists on pursuing its plans to build the Rogun Dam,” she said.
Farkhod Tolipov, director of the Knowledge Caravan think-tank in Tashkent, believes the proposed line will not have a big impact on bilateral relations. He sees the railroad as purely a transport issue. “We should after all separate the transport component of this problem from the political one. A direct rail link between Tashkent and Ferghana is indeed absent and this is a serious problem for Uzbekistan,” Tolipov told EurasiaNet.org. “This problem has persisted for a long time."
Tolipov also hinted that it may be premature to worry about the rail line's potential impact. “I do not think construction will be carried out any time soon,” he said.
I love this keyboard! I was shopping for a long time for a feature-rich mechanical keyboard as I type like a fiend all day long. I also game, do lots of data entry, and 3D modeling on my computer. Simply put this keyboard rocks at all these tasks. The programmable G-keys are both great for moving in-game commands close to my "WASD" hand position. But they are also incredibly fantastic for mapping hot keys, key combinations, complicate multiple key press commands, and even commonly entered text strings to single key presses to ease and speed up my work in all kind of productivity software. Given most games now a programmed to defeat macros (as the give players an unfair advantage) the macro function for me has been infinitely more useful when working in Excel or my company's database.
It's got the MX Cherry brown key switches which a joy to type on. For those not in the know, Cherry is a German company that specializes in keyboards and is the world market-leader in high quality fully mechanical key-switches. Cherry makes the Cherry MX line of key switches sold with different tactile features and pressure rating by color. Brown features a low pressure with a "bump" feel on the key press. Corsair bought Cherry switches and installed them on this board which is of their own design. All the colors styles of switch are equal in quality, and so its entirely user preference as to which one to get. So while the price is outrageous, but most of the cost is for Cherry switches, which apparently do not come cheap, like most German products.
But of course so do many competing products. Suffice to say i you type a lot either brown or blue Cherry brand key switches are the way to go in any keyboard. They have a very, very fast and positive response that requires only a light touch to type thanks to every key being actuated by metal contacts and steel spring rather than silicone rubber domes . Unlike a rubber membrane aka rubber dome keyboard like 99% of the keyboards you get in nearly all budget keyboards.
Then corsair upped the game by working directly with Cherry to develop switches with RBG led lighting in the switch housing. While the 16 million colors is not quite accurate, it can display thousands of colors many so subtle It's hard to even tell the difference. Corsair is working on firmware upgrades to enable the full 16+ million colors. Only the mode-swtich, and media keys are rubber membrande keys, and I don't press them that often, so I am very happy to save a few dollars for buttons I don't need to be expensive MX switches.
I saw many complaints about the CUE software supplied by corsair to power all the functions of this keyboard. Now I have to preface and confess I am an IT pro, but I found this software easy to use and logically laid out. Yes its quite a bit more complicated than click a key assigning a command, but the way they set it up is very useful if you dive deep into customizing this keyboard. Instead click-then-assign you have the option to first create all the various commands and functions you would like use. Then they sit in a kind of "function" pool you can drag and drop to keys as needed when you are making application specific profiles. Thus you don't have constantly reentered "CRTL+C" in EVERY profile you want a copy function in. Instead you make the function once, and can then drag and drop in 100 profiles effortlessly. IMO this layout is vastly superior to Logitech's or Razor's software systems once you take a moment to learn it. It works very, very similar for creating lighting functions.
Additionally you can remap any key on the keyboard to any other key. For example I do a ton of data entry and have stupid fingers. Thus I remapped / to backspace on the keypad, but thanks to application profiles it only applies when I am running excel! This is a MUCH nicer solution than trying to edit the window's registry to change a key which is, of course, global to every program on the computer. And best yet I can use the 3 "mode" buttons to make a 2nd mode in the Excel profile where / is still mapped to / so entering dates is easy! CUE is a great software and IMO vastly Superior to the competitions. I will cavat though and say that apparently the early releases of CUE were bug-filled abominations that caused BSOD's, crashed, and flat didn't work. But I bought they keyboard in spring of 2015 and I've had a very good experience with it. CUE stays functional through sleep mode and even with the computer running for a week straight. It also has no measurable impact on my computer's performance. I have the fastest Intel i5 CPU you can buy and 16GB of RAM, so your mileage may very here depend on your hardware. And corsair is still actively supporting CUE so you can expect bugs to be fixed in a timely manner.
That being said, yes there is a "simple" mode for all these functions too. So if all you want is red lighting with a simple rainbow ripple its easy to do that. Creating complicated lighting functions is completely optional.
If you are not a DIY type, the official forums are full of uploaded profiles made by users you are free to try too! Did I mention you can effortless export and import all your settings and profiles? Because yes you can! Great for backing up all your hard configuration work in case everything goes FUBAR with your CUE install and you have to do a completely clean installation of the software!
Now for the final bit...the lighting. Yes its awesome. Its not *quite* as bright or evenly lit as Razar's new RGB keyboard, but I think the power and flexibility of CUE and the fact that Corsair uses the superior Cherry MX switches make the K95 a vastly better keyboard overall. The keys are lit more strongly at the top of the key were the LED's are then the bottom so keys like ; that have two marks on them the bottom ; markings will not be a bright. But the lighting is brought enough to easily been seen even at noon with the daylight streaming in through the window on a sunny day.
Of course pretty lights and awesome lighting effect have to "ooooo neato" factor. But they also have great utility. You can color-code your effects to match the application and mode you are using so you can see at glace what program the keyboard is presently running. I can also highlight keys that have various commands assigned to them by color making it really easy to remember what command is programmed where.
Final note: It has 2 plugs but if you have USB 3.0 you only need to use the one with the keyboard embossed on it. The other one is simply to power the keyboard under USB 2.0.
The media keys simply work! Unlike Logitech which always seems to have compatibility problems with its media keys and various media players Corsair's media keys function flawlessly in everything I tried, even with chrome extensions, the domain where most keyboard's drivers FUBAR the media key functions. The volume "roller" is also very nice and has great feel to use with *just* the right amount of resistance to rolling to feel high quality.
The overall build quality is bulletproof. With a metal backing board, Cherry Switches, and quality constitution this board is strong enough to be used as a lethal weapon in battle against home intruders and I expect *still* be able to type afterwards. I would highly advise against nerd raging your fists down on the keys, but I think it would survive it. Obviously I'm not going to try.
Final pro, this keyboard is very attractive. I have a nice minimalist design that also feels very future and high tech. Razor's is OK, but is all plastic, and Logitech's latest offering looks like Tron techno-puked all over your desk. It seems too much like something a 14 year old boy "gamer" would buy to try and impress his pubescent nerd friends. Corsair actually styled a high-end keyboard for sensible adults.
So far I have only minor gripes about the keyboard.
Above is the pros. Now for the cons.
*The keyboard is not wireless! For the price I would have loved to have the option to run it wireless.
*The cable is built into the keyboard. If your cable is FUBAR'ed somehow you are gonna need a new keyboard. For the price that really sucks.
*The cable is thick and not very flexible. Its on par with heavy extension cord. At least it has a very nice braided wrapping to make up for it.
*For some unknown reason Corsair made the backing of the G-keys out of plastic instead of just extending the aluminum plate like the rest of they keyboard. The plastic is high quality but just not nearly as nice as the aircraft grade aluminum that backs the standard 108 key portion of the board.
*I can't seem to change the color of the color of the Caps, Scroll, or Num lock indicators. A super minor gripe but a tiny con.
* I found the included wrist rest to be too low for my liking. Its very high quality and feels very nice however. So save deskpace I removed it and put it away for safe keeping should I change my mind.
*No USB port. Sadly, given this thing eats up 1 or 2 USB ports, it would have been really nice to put a USB port on the keyboard to make up for that.
*100% NOT waterproof. The key switches are open, fully exposed, and the unprotected circuit board is just behind the metal backing plate that forms from "face" of the keyboard. You spill your drink on this keyboard you are going to have a very bad time. Then again no Cherry MX switch keyboard is spill proof so its not Corsair's fault.
*Doesn't ship with a keycap removal tool or any alternate style keycaps like other Corsair products do. Thankfully the tools are like $7 elsewhere on amazon. Chances are you probably wouldn't like the bonus keycaps anyways, so why pay for them?
*I am of the camp that he new "tramp stamp" corsair gaming logo sucks. Thankfully its appears to just be foil sticker. Its a minor gripe but I think you can peel it off you hate it that badly. End of the day I have bigger things to worry about, like bills and real life, than to get upset over a sticker.
The end verdict? They keyboard awesome! I paid $190 for a keyboard and have no regrets!
Not only does it have a very attractive, industrial design, but its very high quality, and great to type on. It had great features, and the CUE software is the *best* gaming keyboard driver i have ever seen once you take the time to learn it. On the IT scale its about 4 in terms of difficulty to use. Not like you have to script every function though command prompt after all! Though you CAN run scripts via macros if it pleases you. The power of this software makes it great for upping your work productivity just as much as powering your gaming wins so its a great choice even for home-office use. And despite some minor gripes I can't remove a star for its faults. For me the only serious one is that I don't get a wireless option. For near $200 I really think I could have gotten the option for wireless, or the ability at least detach the cable. But then there are only like 5 wireless mechanical keyboards currently being made in the world, and this one has the almost most features out of *all* keyboards wired or wireless.
Last but not least I have only run this board for 2 months. I can't report on how I'll fair amid reports that the LED's die on people. So far initial quality is 9 out of 10. So hopefully it will last until something sexier comes out in a good 5 or so years. I like to think they have sorted out issues from the first manufacturing batch, and Corsair does have you covered with an warranty. And hey its amazon, you get a bad one Amazon has your back if you buy from them.
Person texting while sitting down.
As an avid reader of women's sites, I see a new headline literally every day that starts with “These Side-By-Side Photos” or “This Body-Positive Blogger” and has an Instagram post embedded. Heck, I've even written a couple of them.
But I also kind of cringe at them.
If it seems to you like all these viral Instagrams look the same, it's not your imagination. They're incredibly homogenous.
And if any of them leave you feeling less good about your body, that's also not just you. Some of them aren't even all that body-positive, and a lot contain mixed messages.
While I support these people and their efforts to promote body positivity, there's a lot of room for improvement.
Here are some issues I've noticed with body-positive Instagrams – and how we can all do better.
ADVERTISING ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads
1. Thin, White, Conventionally Attractive Women Are Getting the Most Attention
– well – meet society's beauty standards. It's pretty ironic that the faces of a movement based on accepting those who don't meet society's beauty standards are people whowell
@mynameisjessamyn, @gabifresh, @ihartericka, That's not to say others aren't out there. Many fat people, people of color, and genderqueer people are working tirelessly to fight diet culture and inspire people to accept themselves. If you don't know who I'm referring to, try checking out @tessholliday @isupersheng , and @itsmekellieb
But scroll to the health pages of popular women's sites, and it's not so often you'll see people like them.
Instead, you'll find Instagrammers who are white, conventionally attractive, and thin or average size.
I don't mean to imply that these people don't have body image struggles or that they don't deserve to love their bodies. Body positivity is for everyone, including thin and conventionally attractive people.
But the people who are hurt the most by body negativity – and therefore need body positivity the most – are weirdly invisible. And these people often offer a more radical version of body positivity, which could help us all.
Privileged people on body positive Instagrams have inspired a lot of people, and that's great. I don't want them to stop. I'd just like to be seeing a greater variety of people highlighted along with them.
To solve this problem, people on Instagram can make an effort to seek out (and re-gram) marginalized folks like the ones on this list and this list , and publications can also include them in their articles rather than drawing from the same accounts every time.
2. There Are Still Some Body-Negative Messages in There
A lot of body positivity online and offline sounds like “love yourself even if you haven't met your fitness and beauty goals, but still strive toward those goals.”
Or worse, “Alter your body so that you'll love it. Do it for yourself!”
But can you really accept your size but want to change it? I don't think so. The very definition of accepting something is not wanting to change it.
So, it's frustrating to see people talking about how your body's not a problem and then telling you how to fix it.
But she follows this up with:
“ “It's not bad to want to reduce the sight of cellulite, just like it's not bad to want to lose weight and feel more confident overall, but don't set out to lose weight just to have less cellulite. It can be a cherry on top of all the other amazing benefits. If you ask me how to reduce the appearance of cellulite, my answer will be: healthy diet, regular exercise, and proper water intake – that's it.”
So, in other words, it's okay to have cellulite, but if you can get rid of it, great, and here's how. The second part totally detracts from the first.
Many body-positive Instagrams are also punctuated with pictures of “healthy” low-calorie, low-fat, or low-carb meals or pictures documenting the Instagrammers' progress in attaining the appearance they want.
Instagrams like these feed into a major myth diet culture teaches us: that you can love your body and change it – or even love it by changing it.
This can be especially harmful to people in eating disorder recovery who are trying so hard to avoid compromising with their eating disorders and reject all body-negative ideas.
If we really want to promote body positivity, we need to promote it without qualifiers or contradictions.
We need to declare that skin with cellulite is perfect, not suboptimal, but acceptable.
We need to proclaim that fat is beautiful, not just tolerable. Instead of documenting our habits as if we'll love our bodies more once we lose weight, we need to acknowledge that all the self-love we can feel is available to us right now.
3. Those Photo Comparisons Have Some Negative Implications
