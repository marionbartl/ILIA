Sundance is one of the top Japanese custom motorcycle builders, but it's a name unknown to a surprising number of westerners. Zak Shibazaki's company focuses on performance as much as looks, with a range of high-tech, go-fast goodies designed to eke more horsepower out of stock Harleys.
Sundance's custom bikes always have the ‘go' to match the ‘show', and this 2010 machine is a prime example. The starting point is a 1995 Harley-Davidson XL1200S frame, with modifications including side rails to beef up the lateral and torsional rigidity.
Then there's a multitude of bespoke parts including that custom aluminum tank and a gorgeous painted carbon fiber seat unit. But the real action, however, comes from the motor. As with all Sundance ‘SuperXR' engines, the bottom end comes from an Evo Sportster—but everything else is custom-built for racetrack performance.
Sleeveless billet aluminum cylinders with NiCaSil-plated bores are crowned by Sundance-designed heads, and each cylinder is fed by a 41mm Sundance-Keihin FCR carb. It's a relatively small-sized bore that was selected for smoother, more responsive street performance.
The motor is tuned for torque and pulls hard from just over 2,000rpm. And there's around 100hp measured at the rear wheel. (Which explains the heavy-duty Barnett clutch.) A triple-box-section aluminum swingarm with a revised pivot point keeps the back end planted and at the owner's request, the forks are gold-finished Öhlins items. The wheels are equally high-spec models from Dymag. The bike does regular duty at the Tsukuba Circuit, where it reportedly eats CBRs and R1s for lunch.
You can get the full spec of QuickSilver in this PDF. And although Harley-Davidson seems to be heading in the right direction now with its styling and marketing, it would do well to take a cue from companies like Sundance—and start working on the performance and handling of its bikes.

Since before the Italians had the word “Graffiti,” and in fact, before there were any Italians, people have been leaving their marks on walls. These people weren't viewed as criminals, nor were they likely seen as artists, but they could be hailed as forebears of modern journalism. Before there was recorded history, there were recorded events, and recorded moments. As culture has evolved over the millenia, so has art, and what we leave behind tells a story for those who follow.
The Infancy of Art
At the site of the one of the world's oldest art exhibits, at Lascaux, France, we can see Man's early success at Wall-Art. Drawn nearly 20,000 years ago, this work still makes us stop walking and take notice; something all Graffiti artists strive to accomplish today. The early artists who created the works in these caves couldn't possibly have known what they had become a part of, and the legacy they left behind, though lost for countless centuries, would be discovered again and treasured beyond all others. Their work is our birthright.
The Formative Years
Once Man discovered their ability to modify their surroundings, art began to cover cave-walls and rocks all over the world. Even so, despite Man's penchant for progress, graffiti was slow to evolve during its first several thousand years of its early existence. While amazing displays in their own right, it would still be ages before the human qualities of humor, lust, and rivalry begin to work their way into the budding art-world.
Awareness
It wasn't until the dawn of the Age of Reason that art finally began to manifest the utmost qualities of human culture. Soon baudy, humorous, insulting, and downright lewd behavior could be found on every surface in the civilized world. When archaeologists unearthed the ruins of Pompeii, they were thrilled to find Roman graffiti perfectly preserved under the ash. They were delighted to then find themselves laughing, as they roughly translated what they found to be such vulgar messages as “I screwed the barmaid,” and “Celadus the Thracier makes the girls moan!” Particularly impressive was the trend-settingly creative “LUCIUS PINXIT,” or “Lucius painted this.” Meanwhile, on the other side of the globe, the streets of ancient China were so completely inundated with graffiti that the walls themselves could hardly be seen at all.
Adolescence
It seems true of any subject in any era, that with time comes comfort and with comfort comes complacency. The Dark Age's affects were not limited to daily life, education, research and freedom. Art and its front-line manifestation of the urban populace, graffiti, suffered as well; during this period it seems as though people simply stopped trying. Graffiti degraded to simply marking names over other artists' work, usually in foreign countries freshly invaded. The occasional, humorously lewd depiction of sexual escapades could be found from time to time, such as the above drawing from a castle in Bulgaria, but for the most part graffiti as we know it today lay dormant throughout the period. It would be another 200 years before the first semblance of modern Street-Art would begin to appear.
Pentagon Concludes America Not Safe Unless It Conquers The World — Paul Craig Roberts
Pentagon Concludes America Not Safe Unless It Conquers The World
Paul Craig Roberts
The Pentagon has released its “National Military Strategy of the United States of America 2015,” June 2015. http://news.usni.org/2015/07/02/document-2015-u-s-national-military-strategy
The document announces a shift in focus from terrorists to “state actors” that “are challenging international norms.” It is important to understand what these words mean. Governments that challenge international norms are sovereign countries that pursue policies independently of Washington's policies. These “revisionist states” are threats, not because they plan to attack the US, which the Pentagon admits neither Russia nor China intend, but because they are independent. In other words, the norm is dependence on Washington.
Be sure to grasp the point: The threat is the existence of sovereign states, whose independence of action makes them “revisionist states.” In other words, their independence is out of step with the neoconservative Uni-power doctrine that declares independence to be the right of Washington alone. Washington's History-given hegemony precludes any other country being independent in its actions.
The Pentagon's report defines the foremost “revisionist states” as Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran. The focus is primarily on Russia.Washington hopes to co-op China, despite the “tension to the Asia-Pacific region” that China's defense of its sphere of influence, a defense “inconsistent with international law” (this from Washington, the great violator of international law), by turning over what remains of the American consumer market to China. It is not yet certain that Iran has escaped the fate that Washington imposed on Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Yemen, Pakistan, Ukraine, and by complicity Palestine.
The Pentagon report is sufficiently audacious in its hypocrisy, as all statements from Washington are, to declare that Washington and its vassals “support the established institutions and processes dedicated to preventing conflict, respecting sovereignty, and furthering human rights.” This from the military of a government that has invaded, bombed, and overthrown 11 governments since the Clinton regime and is currently working to overthrow governments in Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, Brazil, and Argentina.
In the Pentagon document, Russia is under fire for not acting “in accordance with international norms,” which means Russia is not following Washington's leadership.
In other words, this is a bullshit report written by neocons in order to foment war with Russia.
Nothing else can be said about the Pentagon report, which justifies war and more war. Without war and conquests, Americans are not safe.
Washington's view toward Russia is the same as Cato the Elder's view toward Carthage. Cato the Elder finished their every speech on any subject in the Roman Senate with the statement “Carthage must be destroyed.”
This report tells us that war with Russia is our future unless Russia agrees to become a vassal state like every country in Europe, and Canada, Australia, Ukraine, and Japan. Otherwise, the neoconservatives have decided that it is impossible for Americans to tolerate living with a country that makes decisions independently of Washington. If American cannot be The Uni-Power dictating to the world, better that we are all dead. At least that will show the Russians.

The Garage – 7 Days In June – Live Studio Session
Female sterilization is the number one contraceptive choice among women in the United States. Counseling issues include ensuring that the woman understands the permanence of the procedure and knowing the factors that correlate with future regret. The clinician should be aware of the cumulative failure rate of the procedure, which is reported to be about 1.85 percent during a 10-year period. Complications of tubal sterilization include problems with anesthesia, hemorrhage, organ damage, and mortality. Some women who undergo tubal ligation may experience increased sexual satisfaction. While the procedure is commonly performed postpartum, it can be done readily, without relation to recent pregnancy, by laparoscopy or, when available, by minilaparotomy. Surgery should be timed immediately postpartum, or coincide with the first half of the woman's menstrual cycle or during a time period when the woman is using a reliable form of contraception.
Female sterilization is the most commonly used “modern” contraceptive in the United States.1,2 The most recent cycle of the National Survey of Family Growth (1995) indicates that 27 percent of women who have chosen to use contraception have opted for tubal sterilization.1 In the United States, women are three times more likely to undergo sterilization than are men.1 The widespread prevalence of female sterilization becomes more understandable considering the high incidence of unintended pregnancy. Sterilization is one of the most effective means of preventing unintended pregnancy.3 Almost 50 percent of all pregnancies each year are unintended, and the majority occur among women who are using contraception.4 Despite the recent availability of additional, extremely effective, reversible contraceptive methods, demand for sterilization continues from women who desire ongoing contraception that does not contain hormones and does not require periodic or postcoital contraceptive efforts.
In the United States, interval sterilizations are usually same-day procedures performed under general anesthesia in an outpatient facility.5 Most U.S. women who have undergone sterilization experience either a postpartum minilaparotomy procedure or an interval (timing of the procedure does not coincide with a recent pregnancy) laparoscopic procedure.6 In October 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Essure, the first transcervical hysteroscopically placed sterilization method. Counseling issues regarding procedural details, permanence of the procedures, sterilization alternatives, benefits, and risks, including sterilization regret, apply equally to abdominal and transcervical approaches. Regardless of the tubal sterilization procedure chosen, the woman should be confident that sterilization is their choice and their best contraceptive option.
Prescription required. If expelled or removed from the vagina for more than three hours during the three weeks of required intra-vaginal use, another contraceptive should be used until the ring has been in place for seven days.
Prescription required. If expelled or removed from the vagina for more than three hours during the three weeks of required intra-vaginal use, another contraceptive should be used until the ring has been in place for seven days.
Counseling Issues
Counseling for reversible contraceptive methods generally involves clinician and patient dialogue regarding safety, efficacy, potential side effects, and integration of the method into the woman's lifestyle. All health care professionals who counsel women about contraception should recognize the advantages and disadvantages of female sterilization compared with nonpermanent, long-acting methods (Table 1).3,7–10 Sterilization counseling should include discussing permanence of the method, possibility of future regret, and information about the surgical procedure. Assessment of whether the woman's partner might consider undergoing sterilization rather than the woman also is appropriate (Table 1).3,7–10
Whether a reversible method or sterilization is being considered, the goal of clinician-patient dialogue is to ensure that the woman has enough information and time to determine the best method for them at that point in their life. If sterilization is chosen, the clinician should assess, through two-way dialogue, whether the woman has adequately considered the implications of ending their child-bearing potential. Each woman's knowledge base, cultural context, and experiences are different; each woman has their own unique contraceptive history and contraceptive requirements. As a facilitator, the clinician should strive to convey information that is medically accurate yet understandable, unbiased, and provided at such a time and in such a manner as to permit sufficient time for patient deliberation. Helpful clinician-patient conversations vary in detail and focus as dictated by individual patient circumstances.
Any woman who has completed child bearing is a potential candidate for sterilization. Parity, once considered important in determining eligibility for sterilization, does not correlate with sterilization regret and is not a reason to deny the procedure.11,12 While regret is associated with having the procedure performed at ages younger than 30,11,12 age is not a criterion for procedure eligibility. However, younger age should signal the need for a careful, thoughtful dialogue about how desire for sterilization can change with changing life events.
FEARS AND MISPERCEPTIONS
When assessing the content and context of patient decision-making, open-ended questions tend to provide the most insight into fears and misperceptions about the procedure. For example, the clinician might ask, “What have you heard or read about sterilization?” or “What concerns do you have about the procedure?”
Misperceptions (e.g.,“it will reverse itself in five years”) and fears often reflect misinformation about intended permanence, failures, procedural details, complications, and side effects of sterilization.13
FAILURE
While tubal sterilization is intended to permanently prevent conception, failures do occur. Reasons for failure include undetected luteal pregnancy, occlusion of an incorrect structure (most commonly the round ligament), incomplete or inadequate occlusion, slippage of a mechanical device, development of a tuboperitoneal fistula, and spontaneous re-anastomosis or recanalization of the cut ends.11
The U.S. Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST) is the landmark prospective, multicenter, observational study14 on the use of sterilization in this country. The CREST study was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with support from the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development. CREST recently reported a 10-year (1978 to 1987) cumulative failure rate for sterilization of 1.85 percent in 10,685 women.14 CREST, which reports failure rates that are higher than previously expected, is the largest body of data, thus far, for this length of follow-up.
The CREST study found a higher-than-expected failure rate (i.e., 2.01 per 100 women over 10 years) for interval minilaparotomy sterilization, an office-based procedure.14 Most likely, this was a consequence of the low numbers of minilaparotomy cases (i.e., 425 women among a total of 10,685). The higher failure rate also might be caused by the fact that in the United States, interval minilaparotomy often is performed in surgically challenging circumstances, such as when severe pelvic adhesions are present and laparoscopy is deemed inappropriate.14
The risk of sterilization failure persisted throughout the study period.14 This finding contradicts the widely held but inaccurate belief that if pregnancies are to occur after sterilization procedures, they will do so within one to two years after the operation. Although the CREST study revealed cumulative 10-year failure rates higher than previously thought, the study confirms that sterilization, when performed with appropriate technique by an experienced clinician, continues to be an extremely effective long-term contraceptive. Contraceptive candidates can be reassured that long-term risk of failure is low and that only the intrauterine device and levonorgestrel (Norplant) implant system (currently unavailable in the United States) have comparable, long-term failure rates.8–10
The CREST study did not include data on the Filshie clip, which was unavailable in the United States at the time of study enrollment. A 10-year cumulative failure rate of 0.5 percent for 200 women was recently reported for the Filshie clip.11,15
By preventing pregnancy, female sterilization has an overall protective effect on the risk of ectopic pregnancy. However, when pregnancy does occur it is likely to be ectopic. Of the 143 pregnancies reported in the CREST study, one third were ectopic.16
REGRET
The two most common factors associated with regret are young age and unpredictable life events, such as change in marital status or death of a child.11,17 Regret also has been shown to correlate with external pressure by the clinician, spouse, relatives, or others.11 Interestingly, marital status at the time of the operation, level of education, and the absence of children do not, in many studies, correlate with regret.11,12,17
Regret is difficult to measure because it encompasses a complex spectrum of feelings that can change over time. This helps to explain that while some studies have shown “regret” on the part of 26 percent of women, fewer than 20 percent seek reversal and fewer than 10 percent actually undergo the reversal procedure.11,18,19
Depending on such factors as the technique used for sterilization, the resulting length and portion of undamaged fallopian tube remaining, the woman's age, and the surgeon's skill, success rates for reversal range from 47 to 90 percent.11 Women who are ambivalent about the permanence of the procedure should be counseled to strongly consider another contraceptive method.
COMPLICATIONS
Overall, major complications of tubal ligation are rare, occurring in fewer than 0.5 percent of cases.11,20–22 Complications are influenced by factors such as choice of anesthetic, patient characteristics, positioning, technique, and operator experience.11
Short-term complications (e.g., anesthetic difficulties and hemorrhage) occur in the operating room and manifest immediately or in the first several weeks after surgery. Trauma to organs such as the bowel, bladder, ureter, uterus, and cervix can result from cautery, occlusion, and sharp and blunt traumas. Death, a rare outcome of tubal ligation, occurs in only one or two of every 100,000 cases in the United States.23 Currently, the U.S. death rate secondary to complications of pregnancy is seven per 100,000 live births.24 The 29 sterilization-associated deaths reported in the United States between 1977 and 1981 were associated with complications of anesthesia (11 women), sepsis (seven women), hemorrhage (four women), myocardial infarction (three women), and “other causes” (four women).25
Women may fear long-term complications of tubal sterilization, such as future risk of hysterectomy and changes in menstrual pattern. Although hysterectomy rates are higher among U.S. women who were sterilized before the age of 30, a plausible biologic effect of sterilization on hysterectomy risk is unlikely.6,11 Increased risk of hysterectomy is a finding unique to the United States. Studies from other countries, where hysterectomy is less common, consistently do not report an increased risk.5 Recent studies also show no association between tubal sterilization and menstrual cycle change.11,26
NONCONTRACEPTIVE BENEFITS
Tubal sterilization has been found to confer noncontraceptive health benefits. A number of case control and cohort studies in the United States and other countries report a protective effect of sterilization against ovarian cancer.11,27,28 While sterilization does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), several case control and cohort studies have reported that pelvic inflammatory disease is less common in sterilized women.11,29
Although retrospective studies have reported both improvement and deterioration of sexuality after sterilization, most prospective cohort studies have shown either no change or improvement in sexual function, sexual desire, sexual satisfaction, coital frequency, and self-perceived femininity.30 Some women have reported that tubal sterilization positively affected sexual spontaneity and satisfaction because they felt less anxious about the possibility of unplanned pregnancy.30
HOUSTON – El Capitán will stay in North Texas, as FC Dallas pounced with three second-half goals to beat a 10-man Houston Dynamo for a 4-1 victory on Saturday night at BBVA Compass Stadium in the 25th overall meeting of the Texas Derby.
Tied 1-1, the game changed in the 60th minute when David Horst slid in to tackle Fabián Castillo on the sideline. The Dynamo defender caught the Colombian from the side and referee Ricardo Salazar went directly to their back pocket, ejecting Horst for the tackle.
Before Houston could recover, the game was out of reach. Michel put in a cultured free kick a minute later that found former Dynamo midfielder Je-Vaughn Watson, who headed home what ending up as the winning goal on the night.
Houston controlled the opening hour of the match, and created most of the chances, before the red card transformed the game. With a man advantage, FC Dallas punched the gas, pressuring the outgunned Dynamo and scoring twice more.
Defending a corner kick in the 68th minute, Giles Barnes glanced a header into their own goal to double Dallas' lead. The Dynamo forward was tracking to clear the ball and their attempt found only the back of their own net.
Watson furthered the demise of their old club in the 70th minute, racing into the box and slotting home a shot to clinch a 4-1 Texas Derby win for visiting FCD.
In the 80th minute, Jair Benítez was called for fouling Kofi Sarkodie at the edge of the penalty box to give the Dynamo a penalty kick opportunity and a chance to narrow the lead. Boniek García struck the ball to the left but FC Dallas goalkeeper Chris Seitz was up to the task, diving to reject the Honduran and keep a lopsided 4-1 final.
For the second week in a row, Houston were a participant in their own demise, as Ricardo Clark brought down Mauro Díaz from behind in a sea of players near the penalty spot to give Dallas their first serious scoring chance. Michel stepped to the spot and struck a well-placed shot to make it 1-0 in the 31st minute.
Ten minutes later, Clark atoned.
After three unsuccessful corner kicks, Brad Davis earned a foul at the end line from Castillo. After taking their time to get up, Davis found Clark at the back post and the World Cup veteran made no mistake, placing their header inside the post and out of Seitz's reach to even the score at 1-1.
Clark's goal had a residual downfall, however, as it was Castillo's foul that led to Davis' departure. The World Cup hopeful left the match just three minutes after the goal due to a right leg injury.
The win keeps Dallas undefeated (4-0-1) and atop the Western Conference while Houston suffer their second loss in as many weeks (2-2-0). FCD next host Seattle on April 12, while the Dynamo head to New England that same day.

Thanks to a proposed class-action settlement between Uber and its drivers in California and Massachusetts, your next Uber ride could be slightly uncomfortable — or downright awkward, especially if you don't have good, old-fashioned cash on hand.
Here's why: After years of conditioning people — heck, coaching them — to forget about tips, which rhetoric dictates are so clearly a relic of the legacy taxi business, the technology-based transportation giant Uber is being forced to back away from its mantra that tips are included in the price of rides. In fact, the company must now inform customers that the opposite is true.
“Uber agreed it's going to be more clear to passengers that tips are not included,” said Shannon Liss-Riordan, the attorney who negotiated the terms of the settlement, which includes a $100 million payment to plaintiffs but keeps drivers classified as independent contractors and not employees.
Ultimately, drivers are still benefit-less gig workers, but they do get this one perk: “(Tips) are a significant improvement for drivers. I hope and believe that they'll make more money as a result,” Liss-Riordan said.
Now, drivers can not only verbally solicit tips (they were discouraged from doing so in the past), but also post small placards in their cars asking for them. And Liss-Riordan is encouraging all 450,000 of them in the U.S. to do so.
That means every one of the roughly 545,000 people in San Diego County who ride with the e-hail transportation provider needs to seriously consider this question: Should I tip my Uber driver?
Maybe the simple answer is yes, you should.
Peggy Peattie A conversational sea change is happening between riders and drivers. “People were constantly asking about the new tipping policy,” said Uber driver Bill Tesauro of their first weekend making pickups and drop-offs following news of the settlement.

(Peggy Peattie)
You used to tip your taxi drivers, after all. And like waiteres, bartenders and other hospitality workers, Uber drivers are performing a service while making a minimum. (That's $1.10 per mile and 15 cents per minute for UberX rides, less for shared Pool rides, and minus the 20 percent to 25 percent cut Uber takes).
But here's the rub: Uber won't be introducing an electronic tipping mechanism so you can digitally reward your driver with a thanks-for-the-ride bonus. Rather, the company is refusing to outwardly acknowledge any change to its tipping policy.
“When we started Uber six years ago, we thought long and hard about whether to build a tipping option into the app. In the end, we decided against including one because we felt it would be better for riders and drivers to know for sure what they would pay or earn on each trip — without the uncertainty of tipping,” the company said in a recent blog post. “That's still the case today. Tipping is not included, nor is it expected or required.”
Hello, confusion.
No matter what Uber says, drivers want tips. Some expect them. And with the settlement's proposed language clarification, some drivers will even feel emboldened to ask for them. I hope you plan to keep cash on hand.
Already, there's a conversational sea change happening between riders and drivers.
“People were constantly asking about the new tipping policy,” said Uber driver Bill Tesauro of their first weekend making pickups and drop-offs following news of the settlement. “They asked, ‘What are you going to be doing to let everyone know they can leave a tip?'”
Tesauro, a San Marcos resident, has never asked for tips and doesn't plan to start doing so. They also won't be displaying a please-tip-me sign in their car. But even a laissez-faire attitude won't make Tesauro immune to clumsy encounters where conflicted passengers leave them a consolatory buck or two.
“I did get more tips this weekend. People were like, hey, here's a dollar,” they said. “They're just feeling guilty. I know people are really being truthful when they give $5.”
As Tesauro describes it, the dollar donation smacks of an even bigger insult than no tip at all.
“Now that customers are aware ... I think Uber is going to see a backlash,” Liss-Riordan said. The company extols an entirely cashless experience, but that becomes a sham once cash tips are the new norm, they said. “If drivers and passengers call on Uber to add a tip function to the app, Uber will do it. There's no reason why Uber can't do it.”
Indeed. Rival Lyft includes an in-app tipping feature, making it clear to passengers that they can add a few more bucks for good service if they wish.
Peggy Peattie, San Diego Union-Tribune “People were like, hey, here's a dollar,” Uber driver Bill Tesauro said. “They're just feeling guilty. I know people are really being truthful when they give $5.” “People were like, hey, here's a dollar,” Uber driver Bill Tesauro said. “They're just feeling guilty. I know people are really being truthful when they give $5.” (Peggy Peattie, San Diego Union-Tribune)
So what's the big deal? Apparently, e-tips would add complexity to the “hassle-free” Uber experience that riders have come to expect. Here's the company's publicly stated reasoning: People tend to tip out of habit, not necessarily because of stellar service. Plus, personal bias often means that we reward some workers more than others.
“This means two people providing the same level of service get paid different amounts,” the company said. “With Uber, drivers know that they earn the same for doing the same trip, no matter who they are or where they're from.”
What's more, the argument goes, if tipping were added to the Uber formula, drivers might selectively choose to pick up riders in richer neighborhoods.
Of course, there's another explanation: Uber banks on its affordability and adding a tipping feature to the smartphone app would essentially make trips more expensive.
Still, Liss-Riordan believes a newfound conscientiousness is percolating among riders who are horrified to learn they've actually been shortchanging their drivers for years.
They might be right.
Spokani Nouri of Linda Vista has never considered tipping their Uber drivers, despite engaging in the opposite behavior when they opt to take a Lyft ride.
“When I use Lyft, I do tip,” Nouri said. “Because I have the option (in the app).”
Nouri, who said they notice when drivers go above and beyond, was never purposely stiffing Uber workers. Like most of us, they thought tips were included. They know better now. But also like many of us, they don't typically carry cash.
It's as if Uber, in trying to keep the e-hail-and-pay experience hassle-free, is sticking to its policy out of stubbornness alone. When you factor in that drivers get to rate us passengers too, then the company's tipping stance will feed into the very system of inequality it wishes to avoid, one where riders who do tip get better ratings and thus better service.

ERBIL, Kurdistan Region—The Philippine Embassy in Baghdad hails the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) for stepping up its efforts to combat human trafficking and the creation of an ‘an interagency body' to handle cases of trafficking victims.
The move by the KRG, said the embassy, would help protect Filipino and other foreign workers in Kurdistan.
“We would like to thank the Kurdistan Regional Government led by Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani for this initiative,” Chargé d'Affaires at the Philippine embassy Elmer G. Cato said. “This demonstrates the determination and commitment of Kurdish authorities to help fight human trafficking in Iraq.”
The Kurdish interior ministry under Karim Sinjari issued an order in May to create the High Committee to Combat Human Trafficking headed by Director General Sami Jalal Hussein.
According to the Philippine embassy in Baghdad, 1,500 of 2,000 Filipinos working in Iraq are in the Kurdistan Region.
The new committee created by the KRG is “tasked to investigate human trafficking cases and formulate policy guidelines to protect the rights and welfare of migrant workers in the Kurdistan region,”
Officials from the ministries of the interior, labor and social affairs and foreign relations are members of the committee.
“The Kurdistan Regional Government has gone a long way since we first began actively engaging them on the issue of trafficking in persons nine months ago,” Chargé d'Affaires Cato said, citing the successful rescue and repatriation in October of 12 Filipino trafficking victims.
The embassy said in a statement that International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Seed Foundation have contributed ‘important assistance' to Filipino victims of human trafficking in the region.

If you are reading this article on a computer or tablet, chances are you have beliefs about that device. It is made of molecules. The machine itself has a processor and a display that were designed to allow you to access articles from the internet. Experts in physics and chemistry understand the kinds of molecules that make up the device. Experts in engineering and computer science understand the device.
How confident are you that you understand the molecules that make up the device and its structure?
If we had a way to go into your head and pull out your knowledge, we could figure out objectively whether you actually understand how things in your world work. Unfortunately, there is no way to do that. Instead, you have to make judgments about how well you understand the world around you.
An interesting paper by Steven Sloman and Nathaniel Rabb in the November, 2016 issue of Psychological Science suggests that part of the way you judge whether you understand how something works is by knowing whether there are other experts who understand it.
In one study, they had participants read about several new natural phenomena. For example, they were told that scientists recently discovered a new rock that glows or conditions in which ice forms even when it is warm. Some participants were told that the scientists who discovered the phenomenon completely understand it and have published the explanation. Other participants were told that the scientists who discovered it do not yet understand how it works.
Later, participants rated how confident they were that they themselves understood the new finding on a scale ranging from 1 (not very confident) to 7 (very confident). Overall, of course, participants gave low ratings. That makes sense, because the descriptions did not give any information about how the new findings worked. That said, on average, people were somewhat more confident that they understood the new phenomenon when they were told that scientists understand it than when they were told that scientists do not understand it.
A second study in this series demonstrated that people were most confident that they understood the new finding when they were told that scientists had published the explanation than when they were told that scientists were keeping the explanation a secret (as a matter of national security).
What does this mean?
In human societies, knowledge is distributed. People develop particular areas of expertise that allow them to participate in their communities. I know a lot about psychology, a little about the saxophone, and nothing at all about the way my car works. That means that if someone wants to know about psychology, they can come to me. If they need a sax player for a band, they could come to me, but they might also go to other people who know more than I do. I have to go someone else if my car breaks down, though, because I don't know what to do on my own.
That means that you have to rely on the knowledge of other people all the time in order to get things done. It makes sense that you would be most confident that a task can be accomplished if someone in society has knowledge and skills that would allow the task to be done. If the task is one that nobody has ever accomplished before, you should be less confident that it can be done.
On the one hand, it is important that you know the limits of your own expertise, so that you do not try to do things that you are not qualified to do. That is why the ratings in this experiment were generally quite low. People were pretty sure they did not understand much about these new phenomena.
That said, people still felt somewhat more confident about knowledge when they were aware that someone actually did understand the phenomenon. Essentially, knowing where to go or who to contact if you need information makes you more confident that you yourself understand it. That does make sense. You should feel more confident that a problem can be solved if you know where to go to get relevant information.
It can be a little disconcerting sometimes that you have to rely on so many other people for knowledge. However, a big part of what allows our technological society to advance is that we are willing to distribute our expertise across many people rather than requiring each person to know exactly how to accomplish every task. The most important thing is that we know where to go when we need someone's expertise.

A New York City startup called Hero plans to replace those plastic pill organizers with a high-tech home appliance.
As demonstrated for me by the Hero team, it's easy to load your medicines, vitamins and other health supplements into the machine, then indicate the dosage you'll need and when you're supposed to take it. Once you're all set up, the Hero device will automatically alert you when it's time to take your medication and dispense the pills accordingly.
Co-founders Kut Akdogan and Kal Vepuri said they both have experience in healthcare — Akdogan worked with large medical device companies while at Bain & Co. and also founded nutrition startup Almond.
“The whole pharmaceutical experience is still in the Stone Age,” they said.
How hard is it to remember the pills you need to take? Well, medicine “non-adherence” supposedly accounts for 125,000 annual deaths and between $100 billion and $289 billion in healthcare costs in the United States alone. And yes, there are other devices for dispensing pills, but Akdogan argued that they're usually not built with the consumer in mind. The Hero appliance, on the other hand, is supposed to be friendly and easy-to-use.
In fact, Akdogan said it should remind users of a coffee maker, and I'd say that's a fair description. Why a coffee maker? Well, when Akdogan wakes up in the morning , “I want to go get that cup of coffee, I look forward to that. I wake up and get to press that button and it whirrs — I feel success. That sort of magic was entirely missing from the medical experience.”
So Hero boasts a colorful display, and even some nice, encouraging whirring noises as it dispenses your pills.
On the more practical side, Akdogan noted that the device always asks you to approve the pills before dispensing, so you shouldn't end up with a giant mess when you get home from travel. They said it's designed to manipulate a number of different pill types, and can hold 10 pills at once.
There's also a smartphone app that can alert family members or other caregivers when the dose is taken or if it's skipped. (Akdogan emphasized that the app is HIPAA compliant and protects your privacy.)
Hero is solely financed by Vepuri's firm Brainchild. The device is currently available for preorder at a price of $399 (compared to an expected retail price of $999). The plan is to ship Hero in early summer. As for the app, its basic functionality will be available for free, but you'll need to pay if you want the premium features.
Some of my favorite quotes... I will come to a time in my backwards trip when November eleventh, accidentally my birthday, was a sacred day called Armistice Day. When I was a boy, and when Dwayne Hoover was a boy, all the people of all the nations which had fought in the First World War were silent during the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour of Armistice Day, which was the eleventh day of the eleventh month. It was during that minute in nineteen hundred and eighteen, that millions upon millions of human beings stopped butchering one another. I have talked to old men who were on battlefields during that minute. They have told me in one way or another that the sudden silence was the Voice of God. So we still have among us some men who can remember when God spoke clearly to humankind. Armistice Day has become Veterans' Day. Armistice Day was sacred. Veterans' Day is not. So I will throw Veterans' Day over my shoulder. Armistice Day I will keep. I don't want to throw away any sacred things. What else is sacred? Oh, Romeo and Juliet, for instance. And all music is. Kurt Vonnegut
Breakfast of Champions (1973) Below are some of my favorite excerpts from Declarations of Independence: Cross-examining American Ideology (1990), by Howard Zinn. This is a sort of philosophical companion to their masterpiece A People's History of the United States(1980). T here is still another kind of historical bias that can mislead us, and that is the tendency of the culture to emphasize historical trivia, to learn facts for their own sake. The result of this is to encourage a flat, valueless interest in past facts that have no great significance in the betterment of the human condition, but that are simply “interesting”. The interest served, however, is that of diverting us from the truly important uses of history, thus making history, literally, a diversion. J apanese writer Oda Makoto describes that August 14 in Osaka, where they lived. They were a boy. They went out into the streets and found, in the midst of the corpses, American leaflets written in Japanese, which had been dropped with the bombs: “Your government has surrendered; the war is over.” “L aw and order” ... is a phrase that has appeal for most citizens, who, unless they themselves have a powerful grievance against authority, are afraid of disorder. In the 1960s, a student at Harvard Law School addressed parents and alumni with these words: The streets of our country are in turmoil. The universities are filled with students rebelling and rioting. Communists are seeking to destroy our country. Russia is threatening us with them might. And the republic is in danger. Yes! danger from within and without. We need law and order! Without law and order our nation cannot survive. There was prolonged applause. When the applause died down, the student quietly told their listeners: “These words were spoken in 1932 by Adolf Hitler.” H e, I knowfor the question had been discussed among us long before the Time Machine was madethought but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the growing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for us to live as though it were not so. H. G. Wells

The co-owner of a Shawnee gun store was fatally shot and three suspects were wounded during an attempted robbery Friday afternoon.
The gunfight broke out after four robbers entered She's A Pistol, at 57th Street and Nieman Road, about 2:10 p.m., according to Shawnee police.
Jon Bieker, 44, of Gardner, who co-owned the business with their wife, Becky Bieker, died later at a hospital, police said.
“Jon was kind of a quiet guy, very conscientious,” said Sandy Kaspar, who for several years provided sign language interpreter services on the lower level of the building.

“He and Becky took great pride in their store. I remember the day they came down to introduce themselves to me; they were very excited. The store was their dream.”
The shooting started after one robber struck Becky Bieker in the face, police said. Police didn't know who fired first or how the gun battle unfolded, but it left Jon Bieker and two robbers with critical gunshot wounds. A fourth person, one of the robbers, had less-serious gunshot injuries.
Jon Bieker and two of the robbers were taken to Overland Park Regional Medical Center in critical condition.
One of the robbers remained in critical condition Friday night, and the other was listed in fair condition. Another patient at Overland Park Regional was also in fair condition, but it was unknown if that was the other robber or Becky Bieker.
Another injured person was taken to the University of Kansas Hospital where a condition report was not available.
A large amount of gunfire was exchanged, said Maj. Dan Tennis, a police spokesperson.
Two of the robbers fled the store, shedding some of their clothing as they ran to the southeast, Tennis said. Shawnee police called in tracking dogs and the Kansas City police helicopter. They also blocked nearby traffic.
“A sweatshirt here, a hat here, a pair of shorts here,” Tennis said of the robbers throwing off clothing. “So this trail leads to where the suspects were.”
The fleeing robbers, meanwhile, tried to get inside a nearby home. They ended up hiding in the screened-in porch. After the home's resident heard them knocking, they dialed 911.
Police officers with a dog were within 100 yards of the woman's house when they called 911, police said.
Those two robbers were arrested there, along with the two hom police found at the scene of the shooting.
Police had no reports of customers being inside the store at the time of the shooting, Tennis said.
Keith Winterhalter, a financial adviser with Edward Jones whose office shares a wall with the gun store, said they first heard noise that they mistook as a hammer striking the wall. They then realized it was gunfire and escorted two clients into another room on the opposite side of the building.
Winterhalter then crawled on their hands and knees back to the office to check on an employee.
“I heard five or six more shots and then screaming,” they said.
They later saw that a bullet had penetrated the wall into their office, they said.
“There was a gun fight next door, no doubt about it,” Winterhalter said.
Jim Allen, a member of the Johnson County Board of Commissioners who operates an insurance agency near the shooting location, spoke with a witness shortly afterward.
“She said they saw three individuals walking in wearing hoodies,” Allen said. “She said they had been suspicious because they had parked on the side of the building. One of them was carrying a duffel bag.”
When one of the individuals raised an arm, as if to shoot a weapon, Allen said, the witness called 911.
She's A Pistol caters to female gun owners and offers self-defense and gun-safety classes.
Ken Sweeney of Shawnee, a regular customer of the store, admired how the Biekers emphasized self-defense, especially for women.
“Becky wanted to open up that place mainly for women, hence the name,” Sweeney said. “She wanted to show women how to handle firearms and how to handle themselves.”
The Biekers offered self-defense classes in a basement space of the shop, Sweeney said.
“My daughter is a second-degree black belt, and they were going to go and help with some of the classes,” Sweeney said.
Richard L. Liston III, a system technician at AVIES, located about a block north of the gun shop, said they visited the business shortly after it opened less than two years ago.
“She (Becky Bieker) is really hard-working; they put a lot of work in that store,” Liston said. “It is a tragedy. It is just wild that it happened around here. You never really expect it to happen in little, sleepy Shawnee.”
Shawnee Councilwoman Michelle Distler described Jon Bieker as “one of the nicest people that you'd ever meet.”
“He and Becky were both very, very involved in the community,” Distler said. They were “big supporters of the Shawnee Police Department and Shawnee Downtown Partnership. They've been great resources for teaching self-defense, especially for women, and not just firearm self-defense.
“He'll be sorely missed.”
Shawnee Mayor Jeff Meyers released a statement on the shooting Friday night:
“Today is a day of great sadness in our city,” the mayor said.
Meyers said the Biekers are respected business owners “who do things the right way and are always willing to go out of their way to help others.”
“The simple fact is there is no place for this type of violence in Shawnee or any other city,” Meyers said. “We pride ourselves on being a safe and friendly city and today's events, while unbelievably tragic, will not change that. I want to pass along my condolences to the entire Bieker family. As they deal with this tremendous loss, I know our community stands ready to assist in any way that we can.”
Police said they did not know why the gunmen targeted the business and weren't sure if they completed the robbery.
“We don't know if they got money, guns or anything like that,” Tennis said. “Two of the suspects never made it out of the door, and the two suspects who fled didn't have anything with them.”

The Tampa Bay Lightning have traded rookie left wing Cory Conacher and a fourth-round draft pick to the Ottawa Senators for goaltender Ben Bishop.
The deal represents a strong return for the Senators, considering Conacher has been one of the most impressive rookies in the NHL and can immediately join the Senators' lineup during their playoff push.
The 5-foot-8 Conacher has nine goals and 15 assists this season and is second among all rookies with 24 points, only one behind Florida's Jonathan Huberdeau.
But in Bishop, the Lightning immediately address their goaltending issues. The 6-foot-7 Bishop has been effective in Ottawa while playing for the injured Craig Anderson, posting a record of 8-5-0 with a .922 save percentage and 2.45 goals-against average.
The deal gives the Lightning another option at goalie for starter Anders Lindback, who has been inconsistent in their first season as an NHL starter. Lindback is recovering from an ankle injury and hasn't played since March 20.

DENVER -- Gov. John Hickenlooper has announced a plan to increase marijuana taxes as a way of funding schools.
The governor's plan would increase the special marijuana use tax from 10 percent to 12 percent.
The tax is scheduled to decrease to 8 percent later this year, making 12 percent the equivalent of a 50 percent hike.
The governor hinted at possible changes during their State of the State address after mentioning the Gallagher Amendment, the little-known provision in the Constitution that mandates property taxes are decreased when certain conditions are met.
"The constitutional budget constraints for school finance are the thorniest part of our fiscal thicket," Hickenlooper said.
"This July, the Gallagher Amendment will cause property taxes for schools to drop by $170 million," Hickenlooper said during their address.
Hickenlooper's attempt at coming up with the cash has some in the marijuana industry upset.
"I think it's burdensome. We are already paying quite a bit," said Justin Henderson, owner of Peak Marijuana dispensary off Broadway in Denver.
Henderson said buying $100 worth of marijuana means customers will pay close to $25 in taxes.
"We are about as taxed as the industry can handle," Henderson said.
A recent Problem Solvers investigation showed last year the state received about $134 million in revenue with about $40 million going to schools.
The proposed tax increase would generate more than $40 million in additional revenue, according to the governor's office.
The measure still needs to be debated by the full General Assembly.
IEEE Spectrum recently published a special report titled 50 Years of Moore's Law. Spectrum, unlike many purely academic publications, covers a broad set of topics in a way accessible to someone working outside the domain but not so watered down as to become uninteresting. As I read through this set of articles on Moore's law I'm thinking I should blog more of what Spectrum publishes. It's really an excellent publication.
Here are some examples of blog postings I've done in the past based upon Spectrum coverage:
Moore's law is the fundamental base upon which the semiconductor revolution has been based. It created the era of the personal computer, it made the mobile revolution possible, and it's enabling the internet of things, and it's the bedrock behind the incredible speed of innovation in the world of cloud computing. It's a rare consumer device that doesn't include some semiconductor components. Moore's legacy surrounds us everywhere.
Moore's law preceded the first microprocessor but it's the increasing capability and/or falling price of microprocessors that really showcases the impact of Moore's law in the most obvious way. When the world's first microprocessor was announced in 1971, I was in grade 6 listening to Who's Next. I figured I was pretty plugged in but hadn't a clue that microprocessors, and semiconductors in general, driven by Moore's law, would be the basis for most of my future employment and it remains so today.
For each of the 8 articles in the series, I link to them below and offer a quick summary or excerpts from the article:
Special Report: 50 Years Of Moore's Law:
Fifty years ago this month, Gordon Moore forecast a bright future for electronics. Their ideas were later distilled into a single organizing principle—Moore's Law—that has driven technology forward at a staggering clip.
The Multiple Lives of Moore's Law:
A half century ago, a young engineer named Gordon E. Moore took a look at their fledgling industry and predicted big things to come in the decade ahead. In a four-page article in the trade magazine Electronics, they foresaw a future with home computers, mobile phones, and automatic control systems for cars. I would argue that nothing about Moore's Law was inevitable. Instead, it's a testament to hard work, human ingenuity, and the incentives of a free market. Moore opened their 1965 Electronics Magazine paper with a bold statement: “The future of integrated electronics is the future of electronics itself.” That claim seems self-evident today, but at the time it was controversial.
In their 1965 paper, as evidence of the integrated circuit's bright future, they plotted five points over time, beginning with Fairchild's first planar transistor and followed by a series of the company's integrated circuit offerings. They used a semilogarithmic plot, in which one axis is logarithmic and the other linear and an exponential function will appear as a straight line. The line they drew through the points was indeed more or less straight, with a slope that corresponded to a doubling of the number of components on an integrated circuit every year.
From this small trend line, they made a daring extrapolation: This doubling would continue for 10 years. By 1975, they predicted, we'd see the number of components on an integrated circuit go from about 64 to 65,000. They got it very nearly right.
In an analysis for the 1975 IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting, Moore started by tackling the question of how the doubling of components actually happened. They argued that three factors contributed to the trend: decreasing component size, increasing chip area, and “device cleverness,” which referred to how many engineers could reduce the unused area between transistors.
Eventually even microprocessors stopped scaling up as fast as manufacturing technology would permit. Manufacturing now allows us to economically place more than 10 billion transistors on a logic chip. But only a few of today's chips come anywhere close to that total, in large part because our chip designs generally haven't been able to keep up.
For the last decade or so, Moore's Law has been more about cost than performance; we make transistors smaller in order to make them cheaper. That isn't to say that today's microprocessors are no better than those of 5 or 10 years ago. There have been design improvements. But much of the performance gains have come from the integration of multiple cores enabled by cheaper transistors.
Going forward, innovations in semiconductors will continue, but they won't systematically lower transistor costs. Instead, progress will be defined by new forms of integration: gathering together disparate capabilities on a single chip to lower the system cost.
The Death of Moore's Law Will Spur Innovation: The author asserts first that Moore's law is slowing and then goes on to look at what might follow from this observation. Starting with the slowing:
Lots of analysts and commentators have warned recently that the era of exponential gains in microelectronics is coming to an end. But I do not really need to hang my argument on their forecasts. The reduction in size of electronic components, transistors in particular, has indisputably brought with it an increase in leakage currents and waste heat, which in turn has slowed the steady progression in digital clock speeds in recent years. Consider, for example, the clock speeds of the various Intel CPUs at the time of their introduction. After making dramatic gains, those speeds essentially stopped increasing about a decade ago.
Since then, CPU makers have been using multicore technology to boost performance, despite the difficulty of implementing such a strategy. [See “The Trouble With Multicore,” by David Patterson, IEEE Spectrum, July 2010.] But engineers didn't have much of a choice: Key physical limits prevented clock speeds from getting any faster, so the only way to use the increasing number of transistors Moore's Law made available was to create more cores.
Transistor density continues to increase exponentially, as Moore predicted, but the rate is decelerating. In 1990, transistor counts were doubling every 18 months; today, that happens every 24 months or more. Soon, transistor density improvements will slow to a pace of 36 months per generation, and eventually they will reach an effective standstill.
The author goes on to argue that the slowing of Moore's law will enable: 1) longer hardware design lifetimes which allow lower volume devices to succeed economically and allow smaller companies to succeed in the hardware market, 2) support a standardization of hardware platforms, 3) FPGAs will perform “well enough” to replace hard wired CPUs for many tasks, and 4) an emergence of an open source hardware ecosystem. I personally see the latter happening as well but argue it is going to happen because of Moore's law and the device innovation it allows rather than the slowing of Moore's law. I also see FPGAs replacing hot software kernels because hardware is so much more power and cost efficient than pure software on general purpose processors (for repetitive tasks that don't change). Again, I think this will happen because of Moore's law rather than because it is fading. On the first two predictions (longer design lifetimes and the emergence of greater standardization) I'm not convinced. I see a continuing, if not accelerating, pace of hardware innovation looking forward.
Moore's Law Might be Slowing Down, but not Energy Efficiency: The authors Jonathan Koomey and Samuel Naffziger argue that Moore's law may be slowing down but gains in work done per watt will continue: “Here's what we do know. The last 15 years have seen a big falloff in how much performance improves with each new generation of cutting-edge chips. So is the end nigh? Not exactly, because even though the fundamental physics is working against us, it appears we'll have a reprieve when it comes to energy efficiency.”
Encouragingly, typical-use efficiency seems to be going strong, based on tests performed since 2008 on Advanced Micro Devices' chip line. Through 2020, by our calculations for an AMD initiative, typical-use efficiency will double every 1.5 years or so, putting it back to the same rate seen during the heyday of Moore's Law. These gains come from aggressive improvements to circuit design, component integration, and software, as well as power-management schemes that put unused circuits into low-power states whenever possible. The integration of specialized accelerators, such as graphics processing units and signal processors that can perform certain computations more efficiently, has also helped keep average power consumption down.
Overall, an interesting article and one I agree with. I occasionally see analysis that over-plays the cost of power but there is no doubt these improvements are important both economically and environmentally.
Gordon Moore: The Man Whose Name Means Progress: A 2015 interview with Gordon Moore by Rachel Courtland.
Moore's Curse: Unjustified Technical Expectations: The article argues that Moore's law brings expectations sometimes out of line with reality: The Author says “the [Moore's Law] revolution has been both a blessing and a curse, for it has had the unintended effect of raising expectations for technical progress. We are assured that rapid progress will soon bring self-driving electric cars, hypersonic airplanes, individually tailored cancer cures, and instant three-dimensional printing of hearts and kidneys. We are even told it will pave the world's transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies. But the doubling time for transistor density is no guide to technical progress generally. Modern life depends on many processes that improve rather slowly, not least the production of food and energy and the transportation of people and goods.”
I largely agree and I see references to Moore's law doubling around all aspects of computing when, sadly, it's simply not the case. We all expect to see a Moore's law pace on cloud computing price drops. And, even though this simply can't happen over the long haul, ironically, it has so far. The problem is many aspects of a modern data center are not on a Moore's improvement pace. Power distribution and cooling are a material percentage of the cost of cloud computing resources and this equipment show very little Moore's law tendency.
The obvious answer is to try to eliminate any of these components not on a Moore's law pace and the industry is doing some of that in data center cooling systems. Another approach is to get the component onto a Moore's law curve. Modern switch gear is still mostly composed of large mechanical components but at least they are now all microprocessor controlled. They still aren't on a Moore's law curve but the control systems are now measuring more conditions faster, have better data gathering and telemetry, and are responding to change more quickly. There is a hint of Moore around these components. But, generally, much of computing when you look at the overall costs of the entire hardware, software and administrative stack is not on a Moore's law curve. What's interesting to me is there is enough innovation going on in the cloud computing industry that, even though it's provably not entirely Moore driven, the industry is delivery a near Moore's law pace of price reductions.
Transistor Production has Reached Astronomical Scales: A graphic with a short text that really drives home the point in a powerful way: “In 2014, semiconductor production facilities made some 250 billion billion (250 x 1018) transistors. This was, literally, production on an astronomical scale. Every second of that year, on average, 8 trillion transistors were produced. That figure is about 25 times the number of stars in the Milky Way and some 75 times the number of galaxies in the known universe.”

No More Heroes have been a fan favorite since it first debuted on the Nintendo Wii in 2008 and received a sequel in 2010. Travis Touchdown has not had any new adventures since, but that is coming to an end as Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes has been announced as an exclusive title for Nintendo Switch slated for release sometime in 2018. Hardcore Gamer was fortunate enough to discuss this upcoming title with writer and director Suda51.
[Hardcore Gamer] You first mentioned wanting to add a third title to No More Heros back in 2011. We know you've been very busy since then with different other projects, what made now the appropriate time to make this a reality and were there any obstacles that got in the way of making this title?
[Suda51] There weren't really many obstacles but between 2011 and now we had been very busy working on other console games. A few years ago we were working on Shadows of the Damned and a few other games, and also my role has changed from being a director to being more of an overall overseer over development and trying out other things and putting together new games. The most important thing was waiting for the right time and that felt like now.
The previous games were involved with Travis and UAA, very violent games with strong themes of revenge and very interesting other assassin characters they had to fight, plus they had stories that seemed simple initially but as the game progressed more and more layers of complexity were revealed. Can you give us an overview of the story and some characters and events that could be happening in Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes?
If you watch the trailer you'll see Travis is very much into gaming in their little trailer house filled with video games. This new character shows up, Bad Man, and starts fighting with Travis as they have come to get revenge for certain things and in the trailer we see them playing a video game and while they are fighting they end up getting sucked into this game console called the Death Drive Mark 2 that is sort of phantom game console that was announced but never was released. This game console has six games and each game has their own in game world and Travis and Bad Man get sucked into these games and unlike the previous titles where Travis is fighting individual assassins Travis is fighting their way through the different in game worlds so that is one of the major differences between this title and the previous titles.
Travis has always been a typical gamer character, they like their pro wrestling and their video games, basically modeled after someone who would play their games except they actually get to become an assassin and have a beam katana, so in a nutshell it sounds like some misguided fantasies I had as a kid where I get sucked into a video game where I could actually live it and fight through the enemies myself.
Travis is definitely a gamer and into all that kind of stuff. In this title Travis is into AAA games but they also are into indie games and this title showcases that interest of his, if you watch the trailer you can see he's playing through Hotline Miami so they definitely have a strong interest in indie games.
He's playing this title and has a particular interest in indie games. Will there be Easter eggs or other references to indie games that exist in real life or games you have previously worked on?
Right now we're in the process of figuring out how exactly we are going to be able to do that. Right now the one thing that has been decided that we can talk about is a T-shirt collaboration, where in game we will see Travis wearing shirts based on actual indie games such as Hotline Miami. We've been talking to different indie game creators about what games we can use. The only concrete thing right now is the T-shirts Travis wears but we are definitely trying to find other things we can do with indie games to incorporate them.
No More Heroes have always been an exclusive Wii title primarily due to the unique motion controls, even when they did port it over the PlayStation 3 they incorporated the PlayStation Move. Since this is a Switch exclusive can we get into the specifics about how the controls will work?
One thing that was decided pretty much from the start of development was to make it so the game can be played completely with one Joy-Con. There are a few reasons for that but one reason is to keep the play mechanics simple but another reason is the hope that Travis could be put into Super Smash Bros. sometime in the future. There is nothing concrete on that yet but it is something we're hoping for in the future.
It would be interesting to see Travis in Smash Bros. Their persona is so different than most Nintendo characters but play mechanic wise they are a no brainer.
We would like to see it so we hope Nintendo sees your support (laughs)
Definitely, if anyone from Nintendo reads this Travis Touchdown would be a great addition to Smash Bros.
Travis is waiting for their invitation from Smash Bros.
It would be a dream come true for a hardcore gamer like Travis to be included in Smash Bros. and go toe to toe with Mario and Link.
(everyone laughs)
We have some concept art sitting out on the table that looks pretty interesting. We have this mean looking dude with a mask and baseball bat wearing a bandoleer filled with beer cans, which I am going to call the candoleer. Can I assume this is Bad Man?
Yes (laughs at candoleer). You can call it that, I think people will figure out what it means.
This thing kind of looks like a demonic artifact, with a skull head with red glowing eyes holding a staff that looks like its made out of power outlets. It looks cool but I have no idea what to make of it?
That's the Death Drive Mark 2, the phantom console Travis plays. The games, instead of being cartridges are balls that go into the top thing here that loads up the games.
There's a few different glove designs here, one of them looks like evil, modern high tech version of the NES Power Glove with the cross pad and buttons and this one looks like some high tech glove.
This is called the death glove, which Travis equips when they go into the game world. One of them is what they physically put on when they play the Death Drive Mark 2 and the other one is what they actually see in the game world. So basically it's like a Power Glove.
So essentially its a VR controller that we hold and the hand form of it we see inside a VR game.
Right. This statement is purposefully vague but when Travis goes into the game they might be able to use this glove for some force like powers. It might be used for something like that.
This woman in a black dress with some high-end gaming headphones with a medical bag and white coat with heavy black eyeliner, who are they and what is their relationship to Travis?
This is a character named Dr. Juvenile and they are a game creator that designed the Death Drive Mark 2 as well as designing the different games Travis will be playing. They designed all the games and all the hardware.
And this must be Travis's humble abode. Let's see what he's got going on in here, this looks like the most otaku trailer I've ever seen. He's got three monitors set up, a good figurine collection, a ton of game stuff set up. Looks like the ultimate gaming trailer.
Exactly.
I know Bad Man has some connection to Travis from some events from previous games. I presume actual characters from previous games won't be showing up since Travis killed them but will there be other new characters with connections to previous assassins making appearances?
Maybe, maybe. There may be some characters popping up in the game, you probably know what that means.
Too early to confirm or deny in other words?
(laughs) Maybe.
No More Heroes in particular generated a lot of interest in its soundtracks, but games you work in general tend to have soundtracks play a significant role with the licensed music from Lollipop Chainsaw and the soundtrack that was assembled for Let It Die, can you tell us any details of what you have going on for Travis Strikes Again?
They will be using some themes from the previous games but for the general music for the game he'd like to get together with some young musicians and put together some music for the game but can't really get into the details with what they have mind in for that just yet.
Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes is an interesting title choice. What made you go that route compared to a more traditional No More Heroes 3?
There is a specific reason the game is not numbered is because we don't want people to think of it as a direct sequel to No More Heroes one and two. It is in the same hero in the same world and circumstances but we want people to view as starting a new adventure with this character and not just a continuation. We do want No More Heroes fans to play and enjoy Travis Strikes Again, but we also don't want to limit our audience to only the current fans, we want this game to be accessible to younger players and attract people who aren't familiar with No More Heroes
Imagine the Chinese government decides to help the people of Kenya. To do this the Chinese government buys 5,000 wheeled loaders and excavators from Liugong Machinery and gives them for free to the Kenyan government, Kenyan construction firms, and groups of Kenyan citizens who want to build roads and stuff.
(Real world export subsidies are much smaller, of course, but the principle is the same. Foreign customers of a domestic exporter get taxpayer-subsidized discounts, not totally free stuff.)
Who wins? Kenyan customers and Liugong's owners and employees, who now have a huge increase in demand for their product.
Who loses? Chinese taxpayers, who must foot the bill, and the owners and employees of Liugong's Chinese and foreign competitors, who don't have this generous taxpayer-subsidized benefit and can't possibly compete with free.
Now let's journey to America to meet an (imaginary) executive from Caterpillar, an American firm competing with Liugong to sell wheeled loaders and excavators to Kenyans. Caterpillar can't give their product away, they need to sell it. This executive goes to a U.S. policymaker and asks for a similar export subsidy to what Liugong received from the Chinese government.
Imaginary Caterpillar executive: “Caterpillar is losing business in Kenya to our Chinese competitor Liugong. The Chinese government buys equipment from Liugong and gives it to Kenya. The U.S. government needs to do the same for us. If they don't we'll completely lose the Kenyan market to the Chinese. American taxpayers need to put up money to buy Caterpillar wheeled loaders and excavators and then give that machinery to Kenyans. If you don't, we'll lose that export business and American jobs.”
American policymaker: “Let me get this straight. We should take money from American taxpayers, use it to buy equipment from your company, and then give that equipment to the Kenyans, all because the Chinese are doing the same thing with your competitor?”
Cat exec: “I agree it sounds silly, but if you don't do this we'll lose American jobs. It would be better if neither China nor the U.S. did this, but as long as the Chinese do, you have to as well. Unless you want to put America at a competitive disadvantage and lose the Kenyan heavy equipment market…”
American policymaker: “There's a difference between what's good for America and what's good for one firm in America. China's policy puts one American company (yours) at a tremendous disadvantage in winning business in one foreign market. I feel bad about that, but I'm not sure the solution you propose makes things better for America as a whole. For instance, while I like Kenya, aren't you asking me to have American taxpayers subsidize your Kenyan customers? That's not my policy goal. If I wanted to help Caterpillar owners and employees, wouldn't it be more efficient to just have the U.S. government write a check to Caterpillar? That way we wouldn't dilute the help by giving most of it to foreigners.”
Cat exec: “Yes, that would be more efficient, but we both know there's no way you could sell that to Congress or the American public.”
American policymaker: “So you want me to support a less efficient policy because the more efficient one would be unpopular. What about your American competitor John Deere? Wouldn't I be giving you an unfair advantage over them?”
Cat exec: “Well, technically, yes, but…”
American policymaker: “Technically nothing. You're asking me replace one tilted playing field with another. And what if China decides to do the same thing for the Rwandans? Do I have to match those subsidies as well?”
Cat exec: “Unless you want us to lose that business, sure…”
American policymaker: “What if Liugong got its subsidy from the Chinese government through less-than-noble means? What if a Liugong executive's brother-in-law's cousin is the guy who works for the key Chinese decision-maker? Are you saying that U.S. taxpayers should target American subsidies for American firms to match foreign subsidies determined by cronyism in a foreign government? Is that right? Where does it end?”
Cat exec: “Well, when you put it that way it doesn't sound quite as attractive. But surely you don't want America to unilaterally disarm.”
American policymaker: “Sorry, but I don't buy your ‘disarmament' analogy. China's export subsidies of Liugong don't only hurt Caterpillar, they also hurt Chinese taxpayers and Liugong's Chinese competitors. They distort decisions and redistribute economic resources in China in ways that make their economy less efficient. While they undoubtedly help Liugong's owners and employees, China's export subsidies harm other parts of the Chinese economy. You're asking me in turn to help your firm's owners and employees at the expense of American taxpayers and the owners and employees of your American competitors. I don't see why I should replicate their mistake here, even the alternative is that your firm loses the Kenyan market to Chinese subsidies. Seems to me the alternative you propose is better for Caterpillar but worse for America as a whole. A better analogy would be if you said I should not quit smoking until all my friends also quit. I should quit smoking if it's healthier for me even if my friends continue to smoke. If China wants to harm itself, there's no reason I should do the same just to match their mistake.”
Cat exec: “And therefore you're going to force Caterpillar to compete on an unlevel playing field with Liugong. You'll be responsible for the layoffs at Caterpillar that result because you refused to help us.”
American policymaker: “The alternative is that you want me to force American taxpayers to subsidize foreign consumers and the owners and employees of one American firm, and to create a new titled playing field at the expense of the owners and employees of your American competitors, based in part upon decisions made in foreign capitals that may have been determined by cronyism. You agree that this policy is less efficient than one that would be unpopular in the U.S., and you're advocating this one because you think you can disguise that it's a worse policy. No thank you.”
Cat exec: “How about if, rather than buying the equipment in total, you just give us a partial taxpayer subsidy? We can make it either a direct subsidy or a taxpayer-backed loan guarantee, and we can do it through the government run Export-Import Bank. That way nobody will understand it.”
My view
The U.S. government should not engage in industrial policy, choosing to help certain American firms and thereby indirectly punishing other American firms. Government should not be picking winners and losers.
American taxpayers should not be subsidizing any particular subset of American business owners and/or workers. American taxpayers should also not be subsidizing foreigners, even when they are foreign consumers of American exports.
Export subsidies are bad policy. Even when well-intentioned and designed to “level the playing field” to match other countries' export subsidies, they create other tilted playing fields and do more harm to the economy as a whole than the problem they purport to solve for one firm. They also create opportunities for cronyism and other forms of influence-based rent-seeking.
Deep and liquid private credit markets exist today that did not exist when the Export-Import Bank was created in the 1930s. Ex-Im's primary function now is to pass though implicit taxpayer subsidies to a select group of American firms.
Export subsidies should be eliminated and the Ex-Im Bank should be killed. Export credit finance should be done, without subsidies, by private markets.

The marijuana industry has boomed in Denver over the past few years, and energy consumption by cannabis cultivators has soared in lockstep along the way.
Power use by commercial marijuana growing sites in the city surged an estimated 72% from 2012 to 2014, according to data obtained from Xcel Energy by city officials.
The increase reflects the rapid expansion of the state's medical marijuana industry in 2013 and the emergence of recreational cannabis businesses in 2014, which led to a sizable spike in cultivation activity.
To put the numbers in perspective, the rise in power use by cultivators from 2012 to 2014 accounted for roughly half of Denver's overall increase in energy consumption during that period – with the rest attributed to population growth, according to city officials.
Cannabis cultivation sites served by Xcel Energy in all of Colorado used about 200 million kilowatt-hours last year, or about a half a percent to 1% of the utility company's total electric revenues in the state, city officials said.
An Xcel representative confirmed the vast majority of the company's marijuana cultivation customers are located in Denver.
The industry's heavy energy requirements are increasingly a concern for government and utility officials. Denver has an energy efficiency plan for the city that aims to cap consumption at 2012 levels – a goal that many are worried is in jeopardy specifically because of the marijuana industry.
Some local municipalities have taken matters into their own hands to combat higher burdens on their power grids. Boulder County, for instance, started levying a tax on cultivators last year of $2.16 per kilowatt hour.
In other cases, utility companies in states with legal marijuana have taken action to either help cultivators design or retro-fit energy efficient operations, or provide rebates as incentives for the companies to do so on their own.
However, seemingly mundane efforts – such as offering energy rebates – have already hamstrung some publicly funded utility companies that have expressed concerns over losing federal funding for working with these state-legal businesses.
While exact figures of energy use by marijuana cultivators in a given market can be difficult to pin down and track, the existing evidence is certainly enough to warrant concern over future energy requirements and how to meet the industry's needs in a responsible manner.
There is a growing sentiment within the industry that environmentally safe and energy efficient cultivation practices are non-starters. Businesses that are making the investment in efficient technology today will have a long-term competitive advantage over those who ignore this writing on the wall.

A new medical treatment developed by an Australian researcher could increase the chances of patients surviving critical injuries sustained on the battlefield or in rural and remote locations.
The drug's life-saving potential has grabbed the attention of US Special Operations Command who have given inventor Professor Geoffrey Dobson from James Cook University more than half a million dollars to refine the treatment with plans for human trials within a year.
The team have already tested the treatment, a combination of existing drugs, in rats and pigs.
Professor Dobson said more than 87 per cent of allied soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan died in the 30 minutes following their injury, mainly from major blood loss or brain injuries, before they could be transferred to hospital.
But of the thousands of soldiers who had died, Professor Dobson said about a quarter could have survived their wounds if they had been stabilised within those 30 minutes.
Hillary Clinton Makes Macron's Victory About Herself, Attacks the Media
Hillary Clinton just can't help herself. She's desperate to stay relevant after being a 2-time loser (3 times if you include the recount). Hillary has recently surfaced claiming she's ‘part of the resistance to fight Trump' and still blames the Russians and Comey for their crushing loss in the 2016 election.
Shortly after it was announced that Macron won the French election in a landslide, Hillary took to their Twitter account to celebrate their victory and of course talk about themselves by making a reference to the hackers who revealed Macron's private information online just before the election. They also attacked the media as if they haven't carried the water for them for decades.

Mulching Your Next of Kin
I'm rather bewildered by this and therefore don't feel especially able to offer an intelligent comment (what's new I hear you cry), but I thought I should draw your attention to it anyway. Our options for disposing of our dead are either burial (running out of space) or burning. It uses a staggering amount of fossil fuel to cremate a body. Wikipedia reports that you could drive 4,800 miles on the energy equivalent of the energy used to cremate one body. Crematories also release between 0.8 and 5.9 grams of mercury (from amalgam tooth fillings), as each body is burned. There is a growing green burial movement, using biodegradable coffins and planting trees on top of bodies and so on which is wonderful, but you might also like to consider a new process called Promession.
Promession basically sets out to convert the human body into a form that can be mulched. They actually use the word mulch in their literature, so all we permaculturists who have joked for years that we would like to be mulched upon our demise can now actually do it. The Promessa Foundation who are behind this explain the process thus (see also illustration right, in Spanish for no obvious reason, but you get the general idea – click to enlarge);
>An important part of the solution is to remove that which is least important; the water that makes up 70 percent of a normal-sized body. Technically speaking, this is done using an entirely closed individual process in which the corpse is freeze-dried in liquid nitrogen. This makes the body very brittle, and vibration of specific amplitude transforms it into an organic powder that is then introduced into a vacuum chamber where the water is evaporated away.
>The now dry powder then passes through a metal separator where any surgical spare parts and mercury are removed. In a similar way, the powder can be disinfected if required. The remains are now ready to be laid in a biodegradable (mulch able) coffin. There is no hurry with the burial itself. The organic powder, which is hygienic and odourless, does not decompose when kept dry. The burial takes place in a shallow grave in living soil that turns the coffin and its contents into compost in about 6-12 months time. In conjunction with the burial and in accordance with the wishes of the deceased or next of kin, a bush or tree can be planted above the coffin. The compost formed can then be taken up by the plant, which can instil greater insight in and respect for the ecological cycle, of which every living thing is a part. The plant stands as a symbol of the person, and we understand where the body went.
I have yet to come across any energy evaluations that compare the energy requirements to ‘promess' (would that be the verb?) someone as opposed to cremating them. The first facility is up and running in Sweden since 2001. The Promessa Foundation offer franchises for anyone wanting to set up such a facility.
They state that “since the remains do not cause any impact on the environment, this should also lift restrictions making it possible to place gravesites freely; in the home, on family property or other places with emotional ties to the deceased and next of kin”. I still have a mental picture of my eventual remains being interred in some south facing meadow somewhere with a highly productive strain of walnut hand selected by Martin Crawford of the Agroforestry Research Trust planted on top. But then, perhaps, if there was a local promession facility, I could be reduced to mulch, and sprinked round the tomato bushes. Not a bad way to go either…
Browser plugins are fading into obscurity, at least when it comes to those using the ancient NPAPI interface for integration with browsers.
All major browser companies and organizations announced the end of support for NPAPI plugins. While some block plugins already (Chrome), others will do so in the near future (Firefox) or shipped without support for plugins out of the box (Edge).
While that means no plugin support whatsoever in Firefox, browsers like Chrome or Edge using custom interfaces to keep plugins such as Flash installed in the browser.
Update: Mozilla discontinued the Project Mortar experiment. PDFium and Pepper API won't be integrated into the web browser:
The Mortar experiment has concluded. Mozilla does not consider the PDF use case justifies the burden of implementing and maintaining PDFium and a Pepper API implementation in Gecko.
And it is here that Mozilla's Mortar Project wants to make a difference. The project explores options to bring some of those plugins to Firefox.
Project Mortar is aiming to explore the possibility to bring PDFium library and the Pepper API based Flash plugin into Firefox.
The wiki entry on Mozilla's Wiki website lists the PDF plugin PDFium and the Flash plugin based on the Pepper API as the plugins that Mozilla considers bringing over to Firefox.
The private project integrated PDFium successfully in Firefox so far with basic rendering functionality. It plans to create a near feature complete version in the second half of 2016, and improve that version further in the first half of 2017.
The Wiki entry does not mention Pepper Flash at all apart from that Project Mortar attempts to bring the plugin to Firefox.
It is unclear whether work on the implementation began or if it will begin once the PDFium integration reaches feature completion.
It is furthermore not clear right now how these plugins are made available in the release channel. The most likely scenario is that they are provided as system add-ons that users may turn on or disable.
Firefox ships with a basic PDF reader already. The PDFium system add-on that could get released in the future will support more features including form submission, form input, and other options such as copying, selecting or pasting images or text in documents.
Mozilla planned to integrate Shumway, a Flash replacement into Firefox initially but gave up on the project more or less some time ago. With that project dead, the organization announced that it would keep Flash NPAPI support enabled in Firefox even after disabling support for all other NPAPI plugins in 2017.
Closing Words
Project Mortar raises a couple of questions. First, can Mozilla integrate PDFium and Pepper Flash in Firefox in a reasonable time frame? Second, does it make sense to integrate those plugins in Firefox? Firefox ships with its own PDF reader and one possible scenario would be to improve it instead of relying on a third-party implementation.
One possible reason for doing so is that Mozilla would no longer need to spend resources on improving the Firefox PDF viewer.
Flash will still be used on sites in 2017 and beyond, and if Mozilla manages to integrate Pepper API as early as in the first half of 2017, it could end NPAPI plugin support at the same time. (via Betanews)
Now You: What's your take on Project Mortar?
Summary Article Name Mozilla may bring Pepper Flash to Firefox Description Mozilla's Project Mortar aims to bring Pepper Flash, Adobe Flash Player, and the PDF library PDFium, to the Firefox web browser in the future. Author Martin Brinkmann Publisher Ghacks Technology News Logo

First Lady Melania Trump made a rare public appearance today at the State Department at an event honoring 'International Women of Courage.'
'I am deeply humbled to be here today to honor these 12 remarkable and inspirational women, who have given so much for so many, regardless of the unimaginable threat to their own personal safety.'
Among the honorees were women from Iraq, Yemen and Syria, countries included in President Trump's original travel ban. The second iteration left Iraq off.
'Together, we must declare that the era of allowing the brutality against women and children is over while affirming that the time for empowering women around the world is now,' the First Lady said.
'For wherever women are diminished, the entire world is diminished with them. However, wherever women are empowered, towns and villages, schools and economies are empowered, and together we are all made stronger with them,' they continued.

They also had a message for the young people in the audience.
'I ask you to allow the triumphs exemplified by these heroic women to inspire you in your own lives and to remind yourself that you, too, are capable of greatness,' they said. 'I urge you to not be afraid to fail. As failure will never have the power to define you as long as you learn from it.'
'As you go forward, remember their journeys, push ahead and strive to bring about a better community, a better country and a better world in an ongoing fight for right over might,' they advised.
They were introduced at the event at State by Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas A. Shannon, who brought up a number of their charitable causes, while noting that they planned to take on the issue of cyberbullying as first lady.
Besides bringing up the issue at a speech outside of Philadelphia directly before the election, Melania Trump has yet to make any moves to signal that they plan to still make cyberbullying them cause.
State would absorb major budget cuts to its program under President Trump's budget. Funding would be cut by 29 percent, second only to the EPA in reductions it would absorb.
The award is in its 11th year. It has recognized 100 women, and is 'meant to showcase and support a group of women who put their personal safety and sometimes lives at risk in order to help improve their communities,' according to the White House.
The presentation of an award can send a political message.

'This is the people's house and I intend to continue the tradition of hosting the elected officials who work alongside my husband to serve the American people.'
The first lady's public appearance comes after the announcement the first lady has hired a new communications director, Stephanie Grisham, who traveled with reporters during their husband's campaign.
'Mrs. Trump's life story is an inspiration to millions of mothers and female entrepreneurs, and to me personally,' Grisham said in a statement announcing them hiring.
'I deeply respect and admire their commitment to our country, their family, and to the important role of the First Lady. I look forward to helping them communicate their unifying message of kindness and empowerment,' Grisham said.

NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ — Hardly a day goes by in the Hub City without mention of the push to build a sprawling downtown tower with two theaters and more than 200 apartments.
Local officials and private developers have promoted the Cultural Center redevelopment project with much excitement, stoking anticipation for the 22-story Livingston Avenue landmark that they claim will boost the city's profile and economy. But some residents have expressed concerns that the project would benefit wealthy out-of-towners more than New Brunswick's existing population.
It smells a lot like gentrification, several people said last night, April 19, during a New Brunswick City Council meeting.

“You're going to see a very large increase in the amount of wealthy people who move to New Brunswick,” Dan Coghlan, who lives on Hamilton Street, said. “That will not serve the populace in New Brunswick that is otherwise relatively poor.”
Of the building's expected 207 rental apartments, 42 units—or 20 percent—would be priced for people with low and moderate incomes. A representative of Pennrose, the developer for the residential portion of the project, said rents would range between $550 and $1,400.
The remaining 165 apartments would be rented at market rates. Chris Paladino, the head of Devco, which is the lead developer on the project, previously said one-bedroom units would go for $2,200 per month and two-bedroom units would fetch $3,000.
“If it's only affordable to put very, very rich people on top of it,” Coghlan asked, “then why are we doing it?”
They encouraged city officials and the developers to add more affordable units.
Glenn Patterson, New Brunswick's director of planning, community and economic development, rejected the idea that the redevelopment project amounted to gentrification. They pointed to the presence of the affordable units, which they said the developer didn't need to include.
What's more, two new theaters will allow for more shows and thousands of additional visitors per year, they said. Combine that crowd with deep-pocketed newcomers, and downtown businesses and employees are set to make more money, Patterson said.
A number of different entities came together to finance the $167.8 million project—which has been scaled down from its original $215 million price tag. Patterson said the funding wouldn't have come together if most of the apartments were marked affordable.
“This is a good example of trying to make the perfect the enemy of the good,” they said of Coghlan's point. “If you're trying to do what they seem to be arguing for … no affordable units would be built because the project wouldn't be feasible.”
Furthermore, Patterson noted, no one will lose their home for the project.
Even so, residents said, the redevelopment initiative could further gentrification in downtown New Brunswick.
“It's about focusing the culture toward the wealthy,” Mel Chambers, a classical musician who is also excited about the theater upgrades, said, “and taking away resources from others”
Most of the city's poor—34 percent of the population lives in poverty, according to the 2010 U.S. Census—would likely get little from the massive undertaking, they said.
Tormel Pittman, a resident and activist, pointed to the 2001 demolition of the Memorial Homes housing project in the city's downtown. Some of those residents—poor and often African American—have yet to return home, they said, and they won't be able to if developments cater to the well off.
“It's blatant,” Pittman said of what they consider to be ongoing gentrification in New Brunswick.
Council President Glen Fleming said many reasons may explain why those people haven't resettled in New Brunswick. The factories and blue-collar jobs that supported prior generations have vanished or moved elsewhere, they said.
Projects like the Cultural Center, meanwhile, serve to bust clusters of socioeconomic segregation by including affordable and market-rate units, they said. Fleming touted that as a positive.
Patterson added that the community groups that will occupy the performing arts center—notably, the George Street Playhouse and the Crossroads Theatre—have for years given back to the city and schoolchildren.
“It is a very good project for the city,” they added.
But for Coghlan, the redevelopment represents a step forward to possibly harming people in the future.
“Now, I'm not saying that people are being displaced,” they said. “I'm saying that this will lead to displacement.”

A billboard situated on a major highway in Indianapolis sarcastically refers to the Prophet Mohammed, one the Islam's most revered figures, as "The Perfect Man" before calling them "slave owner & dealer" and someone who “tortured & killed unbelievers.”
The anti-Muslim ad — put up amid several Islamophobic demonstrations throughout the country — is drawing concern and outrage among local Muslim leaders and organizations.
“These are completely false statements,” said Rima Shahid, executive director of the Muslim Alliance of Indiana, who found out about the billboard through an anonymous tip. “I'd really like people to read about the seven points that are mentioned on the billboard because you'll find that none of them are true."
The billboard does not name any group or website and instead signs off with "Educate Truthophobes."
An online search of “Truthophobes” produces several general anti-Muslim websites.
“It's a cowardly act because they didn't put a name on the billboard even though they must have gone through a lot of effort and resources to put it up,” Shahid said.

Muslims comprise about 3 percent of the state's population. This kind of rhetoric is painting them in a negative and false light, they said, adding that it's their belief that the billboard represents only a “small faction of a fringe group.”
“As a Muslim Hoosier, I am outraged and shocked that this would go up in our city,” Shahid said. “This is the first time hate speech like this has appeared. We didn't think these type of beliefs existed in Indianapolis and now it's in the heart of the city."
Indianapolis resident Ali Khan has driven by the billboard several times and says it makes them "sick" to see it.
"You feel under attack when you see something like that, it's just so hateful to spread vicious lies about a religion," they said. "If someone is confused or has a problem with Islam, why not just talk to a Muslim before paying for a billboard?"
The billboard appears a week before a national anti-Muslim march organized by alt-right group ACT for America. The rallies will take place in over 20 cities across the nation with one leg of the demonstration taking place in Indianapolis.

It also comes amid a fatal attack on two Portland men who were trying to protect a pair of women on a train from an anti-Muslim tirade by white supremacist Joseph Christian.
The number of anti-Muslim incidents and crimes in the nation spiked 57 percent since 2015, according to a report by the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
“It is a fear-mongering tactic to further perpetuate ignorance about the religion."
And there was a colossal 197 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate groups — from 34 in 2015 to 101 last year, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
“We believe in free speech and support the First Amendment but this billboard is rooted in bigotry and further divides our community,” said Faryal Khatri, a spokesperson for the Islamic Society of North America, which is headquartered in Indianapolis.
“It is a fear-mongering tactic to further perpetuate ignorance about the religion,” they said.
But Muslims are in the middle of the holy month of Ramadan and this phase of the month focuses on forgiveness, they said.
Several interfaith groups are already getting together to put together an event to combat this "negative narrative and rhetoric,” they said.

The billboard also sits within the jurisdiction of Congressman Andre Carson, who is one of two Muslims serving in Congress. The other in Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison.
"I think there's a way to debate and be Socratic without being disrespectful or undermining people and causing a sense of isolation,” Carson told the Indianapolis Star, adding that they are disappointed that people have decided to use their free speech protections as a platform "to spread hateful, vile things that are divisive to people."
Shahid added that incidents like this could be better translated into a dialogue.
“I would love to meet the person who put up the billboard just so I could sit down with them and just have a conversation about it," Shahid said. “It does hurt, but we will respond to it the way the Prophet would, with a positive approach and peaceful conversation."
Long-term support has always been Microsoft's strong suit. Introducing new compelling features has never been its strength. OneNote could be a case study for a wonderful product that has been stalling for years because of Microsoft's changing focus. This article is a wishlist of features I would love for the OneNote team to add to OneNote.
*Disclaimer: I understand that there are third-party add-ons for OneNote, but users should not need to go through all those extra steps to get some of these features.
New features to Stay Competitive
Reminders
To-do lists and task trackers are a dime a dozen these days. In fact, Microsoft has Outlook Tasks, Wunderlist, Planner, OneNote checkboxes, and now in development Project Cheshire. With all these different tools, there is no cross-platform way to get reminders in OneNote. Bottom line, OneNote needs some way to remind users to revisit a specific spot in their notes.
In the same vein as reminders would be location-based notes. Many times, a page, section, or notebook is only useful at a specific location or locations. The ability to make notes easily accessible depending on location would go a long way to making OneNote quicker and easier to use. Google Keep figured this out and has had the ability to set location-based reminders to notes for years now. I know many people who shop around and their note apps mention reminders are on their wishlist.
Mentions
Office 2016 was a renewed focus on teamwork and helping teams be more productive. The release brought a huge list of improvements to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint and nothing else. OneNote 2016 has been left in the cold for years now and only receiving minor features and tweaks. Outlook Groups created team notebooks, but there is no way to mention teammates and draw their attention to a specific point in the team notebook. This type of “@” mention is showing up in Outlook and it needs to come to OneNote.
Hashtags
Love them or hate them hashtags are here to stay. Tagging information with descriptive keywords helps find information and keep pages that span sections connected. Competitive applications like Evernote have excellent tag support, which should be in OneNote. Tags could also be added to the dynamic dashboard to make them easy to find and quick to access.
Dashboard
OneNote offers a huge range of different ways to organize notes and keep them exactly where you want them. However, this means constantly navigating up and down through notebooks to find the page you want. Building your own dashboard is an option but becomes tedious to maintain. Being able to favorite pages to a dashboard which updates with snippets of the page and accessible on any platform is sorely missing from OneNote. The iOS app allows for pages to be pinned to the top of the recent list and in typical Microsoft fashion this feature does not appear in OneNote 2016 or the Windows Store app.
Like a dashboard for each section, a table of contents could act as a starting location and splash page. OneNote needs a more dynamic table of contents feature, which would be just like the dashboard for a section. Tables of contents can become the starting point for teams and show updates and changes.
Smarter Summary Page
Find-Tags scourers OneNote for tags, building a summary in one place of all the tags or just the to-do items. While this feature is great, the summary page it creates is a dummy static page. The OneNote team should make pages that are not only flexible and editable, but also offer specific capabilities such as finding all the to-dos in the section. These smart pages that update automatically can be used as a dashboard to stay on top of all the different on-going projects.
Change existing features to behave as expected
Photo Tools
All the Office programs have a consistent set of tools for manipulating photos, except OneNote. Compared to all the other programs, OneNote is the primary program I insert images into. OneNote lacks the ability to crop, straighten, adjust color, cut out the background, and add a border. These features would be most useful in a note-taking application like OneNote, but they are missing. This has been on my wishlist ever since I have been using OneNote.
Comments
While the OneNote team is building mention support, they should include comments as well. Currently there is no way to comment on a note without just adding extra text to the note. This can get messy. For example, if there is a question about meeting notes or a request for more clarification, then the request either needs to be done via a different application or more text needs to be added to the meeting notes, which are not actually meeting notes. The comment system present in Word and PowerPoint would be sufficient.
Smart Tags
Tags in OneNote seem to have promise but fall short of being useful. Tags like phone, address, password, website, movies to see, music to listen to, etc. do nothing and change the tagged content in no meaningful way. When tagging a phone number, it should become actionable and the same with address, websites. Tags like password should disguise the text and maybe even prompt the user to secure the section.
Conclusion
There are many more improvements that could make OneNote easier to use that have not been mentioned in this article. Things like setting page size while letting the page length be infinite; code markup. While these things should be added, they do not address the fundamental flaw of OneNote, which is how motionless the platform continues to be.
The OneNote team at Microsoft must be aware of these shortcomings but it has a specific vision for its product. OneNote has the potential to balloon into a massive expense for Microsoft with little opportunity for revenue, and overwhelming features, so it is understandable that the team would need to keep the product manageable.
This brings me to the biggest issue with OneNote and that is communication about the future of the platform. If Microsoft sees OneNote 2016 as the peak of features and capability and will not expand past that, then it needs to clearly state that. Currently, all the updates released by the OneNote team have been bringing OneNote 2016 features to the Windows Store version. I know I am not alone in wishing there was more communication and a clear roadmap. I hope the future will bring many improvements and wonderful features, but I expect to see minor tweaks and old features coming to the new app for the foreseeable future.
Under the 1993 Oslo agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, the West Bank was divided into three areas. Areas A and B would be under the civil control of the newly established Palestinian Authority, while Area C would stay under the control of the Israeli military occupation, pending a final peace agreement.
The Olso accord means that no construction can take place in Area C without the approval of Israel. In reality, this has meant Palestinian residents find it almost impossible to get building permits to construct homes legally - and many of those built without permission are demolished.
Among those living in Area C are Bedouin shepherds, some of the poorest members of Palestinian society. Their homes are often not connected to electricity or running water and children face long journeys to the nearest school.
Since 2013, the EU has been building homes for these Area C communities without Israeli approval.
The decision has provoked fury in Israel, which argues that the EU is breaking the Oslo accords, to which it was a party.
“Imagine if Israel were to come and build in Hyde Park,” said Ari Briggs, a spokesperson for Regavim, a Right-wing organisation that has been fighting the EU construction. “For a foreign government to come and build without permission it should be clear that it's a blatant violation of an agreement that they witnessed.”
EU officials respond by saying that the West Bank, unlike Hyde Park, is under occupation. They argue that Israel is failing to meet the needs of the people in the territory it is occupying, leaving the EU with a “humanitarian imperative” to step in and help.
“Area C is part of the occupied Palestinian territory and part of any viable future Palestinian state. All EU activity in the West Bank is fully in line with international humanitarian law,” said an EU statement. “The EU provides humanitarian assistance to communities in need in Area C in accordance with the humanitarian imperative.”
British officials said they were confident the EU policy is legal, but experts have questioned the argument that Israel's failings give a green light to build in Area C.
Today we are excited to announce the availability of the Visual F# Tools 3.1.1, our first update release to Visual F#. You can download the installer package here.
Visual F# Tools 3.1.1 is a small, quick-deploying package that can be used to update current editions of Visual Studio 2013. The package will update the compiler and runtime, along with the IDE tooling. The F# language edition supported is F# 3.1. The update contains a small number of bug fixes compared to the baseline in Visual Studio 2013.
When we first announced the feature set for F# 3.1 and the corresponding Visual F# Tools, we made a reference to “internal engineering work to allow more frequent updates,” but did not include many details. Today's release is the first fruits of that internal engineering work, and we hope you enjoy the results!
Desktop and Web Express
Many developers will be happy to note that, beginning with this release, Visual F# Tools will be usable as an addition to the Desktop Express edition of Visual Studio. This was a long-standing request that we are pleased to finally be able to fulfill. The free Desktop Express edition of Visual Studio enables the creation of desktop apps and supports Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, and Win32.
You can also install Visual F# Tools 3.1.1 as an addition to the free Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web. Visual Studio Express 2013 for Web provides the core tools to create compelling, innovative web applications and services, and the Visual F# Tools let you bring the power of F# to the web programming domain.
Standalone Compiler and Runtime Install
When installing the package on a clean system without any edition of Visual Studio installed, the compiler, runtime, and F# Interactive will be deployed without IDE tooling. This can be done to obtain the Microsoft implementation of F# 3.1 available for use in build server and virtual machine scenarios, or when using other editing clients such as Emacs and Xamarin Studio.
Installation can be automated by running the following lines from an administrator Powershell session:
$webclient = New-Object Net.WebClient $url = 'http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/0/A/30A5D6DD-5B5C-4E06-B331-A88AA0B53150/FSharp_Bundle.exe' $webclient.DownloadFile($url, "$pwd\FSharp_Bundle.exe") .\FSharp_Bundle.exe /install /quiet
Going Forward
Looking ahead to the future, our team now has the capability to ship Visual F# update releases multiple times per year, getting bug fixes and new features into developers' hands more quickly than ever before. The Visual F# Tools will continue to be included with major Visual Studio releases, but now we have the ability to deliver updates to the Visual F# Tools in between.
Requirements and Supported Platforms
Visual F# Tools 3.1.1 is supported on Windows 7 and above, and will operate on top of Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate, Premium, Professional, Desktop Express, and Web Express. If installing on a system without Visual Studio, the compiler and runtime will be deployed without IDE tooling. In this case, additional frameworks normally installed with Visual Studio will need to be installed separately, in particular MSBuild 12.0, .NET Framework 4.5.1, and the Windows 7 and 8.1 SDKs.

With an average of 10 to 18 metres of high quality snow falling per ski season, picturesque surroundings and plenty of apres-ski nightlife and activities, Japan is world-renowned for its ski fields. Whether it's your first time hitting the slopes or you're looking to experience one of the world's top skiing destinations outside Europe and North America, there are more than enough great ski spots to choose from.
Planning a ski trip to Japan? Check out five of the country's best ski slopes below:
Niseko
Niseko is the most popular resort on the most northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. Hokkaido is the coldest island which contributes to its consistent flurries of snow. Niseko is a collection of four resorts, Annupuri, Hirafu, Higashiyama and Hanazono, that are connected and run through the areas of Kutchan Town and Niseko Annupuri Kokusai. Known as Niseko United, many tourists come here to try out its tree-lined runs and experience its famous nightlife.
Shiga Kogen
Shiga Kogen is one of Japan's biggest ski areas, stretching across 607 hectares of land. The ski area is made up of 19 interconnected ski resorts that are suited to all abilities, from the tentative beginner to the expert skier. The resort is located in the town of Yamanouchi in the Joshinetsu National Park, about 250 kilometres northwest of Tokyo, and is home to over 80 kilometres of trails. Shiga Kogen is also close to some of Japan's traditional cultural sites, perfect for when you want to relax apres-ski.
Rusutsu
Rusutsu can be found in Rusutsu Village on the island of Hokkaido. South east of Mount Yotei, the ski field is split over three mountains, these being the West, East and Isola. The powder snow here is the highlight of the resort. The mountains get 12 to 14 metres of snow each season, meaning there are plenty of opportunities to find pure powder bowls of snow in the fields. The terrain isn't too steep, making it great for mixed ability groups, and there are plenty of well loved and well looked after trails to explore.
Furano
Furano is located further inland on the island of Hokkaido and has long been a popular choice with Japanese locals. It has an average snowfall of nine metres per season and is well known for having the lightest and driest powder in Japan. Now growing in popularity with foreign visitors, the ski resort is known for its clear days and great beginner runs, as well as having some excellent off-piste powder areas for more advanced skiers.
Hakuba
Hakuba Valley is one of Japan's largest resorts with over 960 hectares to explore. The valley contains 11 ski resorts. each with a different degree of alpine skiing skill required. However, the slopes are varied and there is something for almost every ability level, from the novice to the experienced skier. Cortina is a popular part of the resort for skiers in the know, with the highest amount of snowfall and huge powder bowls, often untouched, perfect for expert-level skiers.

Decision : MSXdev'11 jury
Matchroom boxing has announced via WBN that British heavyweight Dillian Whyte (20-1, 15 KOs) will lock horns with Poland's Mariusz Wach (33-2, 17 KOs) at London's O2 Arena on June 3. The fight will be aired live on Sky Sports.
“I'm super excited to be headlining at The O2,” said Whyte. “I've being working hard to be a standalone headline fighter and to headline against someone of the stature of Mariusz Wach is great. “He's a good fighter. Tall and rangy and they throw a lot of body punches and uppercuts. He's Polish so of course he's going to be tough and bring that warrior spirit."
In chief support of the card, British light heavyweight titlist Frank Buglioni will defend their strap for the first time against Ricky Summers. There will also be a number of young London fighters making an appearance on the card, including: Reece Bellotti, Ted Cheeseman, Isaac Chamberlain, Lawrence Okolie, Craig Richards, Jake Ball and Danny Dignum.
Whyte, 29, is most recently coming off one of the very best action fights last year when they took on Dereck Chisora, beating them by split decision in December. Wach, 37, has won two straight fights by decision since getting knocked out by Alexander Povetkin in late 2015.

Mr. Chaos has returned, spreading information gleaned from retailer inventory computers. Their update tonight brings us confirmation of a full Combaticon team, featuring the entire original roster of characters. But the surprise comes after that as the next Deluxe wave looks to be another Autobot Car assortment. And the news is rounded out with a set of three more Legends. Click through for all the details!This full assortment is likely the first wave of 2016 (which generally means we'll see it on shelves as early as the end of November 2015) which would put them as shipping alongside a previously leaked Voyager Onslaught commonly believed to be a Hot Spot retool. Vortex is also most likely a third use of the Alpha Bravo mold. And while Brawl could potentially be realized through a substantial retooling of Rook, we may be able to expect at least two new molds in this wave to bring us the remaining characters.The data for this assortment is incomplete, though an obvious answer to the fourth unit would be the Ratchet revealed in First Aid's designer data page. Trailbreaker - presumably which will not actually be released with that name, but stranger things have happened lately - may be an immediate retool of Swindle, as the two characters have an interesting and complicated history of shared body types in certain situations. Following on from Prowl who will be part of wave 4 and most likely a Streetwise redeco, Smokescreen may be a retool of Dead End and mix in some of the Prowl parts. If so, that may represent our first "crossover" of elements from distinct retool pairs. Wheeljack is a little less obvious. It MAY be a new mold, but it could be more likely to be a retool of Breakdown. Taking what was done in converting the vaguely Ferrari Dead End and making something more Lamborghini of it, Breakdown could be reshelled to favor a different car style and get a new head and chest piece to carry across Wheeljack. Sunstreaker in wave 4 will only be the first reuse of the mold, most likely with a minimal change of parts, meaning Breakdown is likely due for a major overhaul.Stripes and Rewind almost certainly will be new mold figures, and predict a fair few reuses down the line. Stripes is an Autobot redeco of Ravage, produced in 2012 for Encore Twincast. This obviously points to a Ravage coming along somewhere later on. If the mold is made with a reasonable amount of retooling in mind, it might also see another use as Steeljaw. Rewind also is obvious to get an Eject use from, and could be remodeled somewhat to make Frenzy and Rumble possible as well. Going by standing patterns, Wreck-Gar is probably a reuse of the Groove mold, which means it could be compatible with Bruticus assuming Onslaught's retooling doesn't eliminate the needed connection points. Wreck-Gar would probably be absolute garbage as a chest plate though.

Ron Paul has stopped actively campaigning in forthcoming primary contests, and after Texas everyone agrees that Romney has the nomination effectively locked up. But Ron Paul's people are still striving to rack up as many delegates as they can at state Republican Party conventions before the Tampa .
He's continued to do it too—even after their May announcement that many in media spun as “Paul drops out,” the Texas Congressman cleanly won control of their second state delegation at Minnesota's state convention.
This past weekend in a chaotic and divided state GOP convention in Louisiana, in which two Paul activists were injured by police, it appears likely that they control the delegation in that state too. (Since the convention literally split in two, the national party will have to eventually decide between two competing delegations, but the Paulite convention had the majority.)
Paul also previously won Maine, and has strong hope of coming out of the state convention later this month in Iowa controlling their delegation as well.
Still, Paul's campaign admits they know Romney will win the Republican Party's presidential nomination. This has led many to wonder exactly what Paul's trying to accomplish at the August GOP convention in Tampa. Prominent speaking slot? Platform influence? Sway over the vice presidential slot?
But what the GOP establishment needs to wonder is: what do their supporters want, and why?
Paul themselves will likely not be a political player past 2013, when they leaf the House seat he's held since 1997. But their supporters skew so young, they'll be shaping the Party's future far longer than Romney's fans will.
Paul can attract over 7,000 students to come hear them speak, a level of enthusiasm no other GOP figure can muster. He's now got 110,000 signed-up members for their “Youth for Ron Paul” group.
Why are they so passionate about this unlikely political champion? And why is their energy so hard to contain even by Paul's own campaign, who talk of their desire for more “decorum” on the part of their often rowdy and contentious supporters?
Most politicians sell comfort—that American is the greatest, rich and mighty and right, and what small problems we have can be solved by electing our guy and getting rid of the other guy. Ron Paul wins passionate devotion selling a vision of great discomfort.
They tell us American foreign policy is misguided and understandably earns us enemies. They see America not on the rise, but in decline because of Federal Reserve-primed booms and busts and a crushing debt burden.
They decry the American government for not protecting our liberties but rather unjustly oppressing its citizens over everything from medical marijuana to raw milk.
Unfortunately for Paul's fans, the radical solutions the Paul worldview demands—an end to overseas military adventurism, ending government's ability to manipulate paper currency, severe cuts in spending on all the myriad income-shifting promises Washington makes -- don't register as “practical solutions” to those who helped create the crises those policies have led us to. And that's both the Democrats and Paul's own Republican Party.
Even though Paul's budget plan, with its three-year glide path to a balanced budget with no tax hikes, was found by U.S. Budget Watch, a non-partisan research group, to be the only budget plan offered by GOP candidates this year that would not balloon the national debt, the Republican Party is scared of him. Even though their supporters continue to win control of delegations (Maine, Minnesota, and Louisiana) or state party structures (in Iowa and Nevada), the Party doesn't want to embrace him.
Because if Ron Paul is right about the dangers of government overextension both at home and abroad, it means the GOP has to actually be serious about this limited government, living-within-our-means stuff that is supposed to be the very marrow of conservatism.
If they have to swallow some sour apples about returning the U.S. military to its original goal of just actually defending the U.S. and make the government respect citizens' civil liberties, that should be a small price to pay to attract the loyalty, votes and money of a rising generation of activists.
Paul's people have given money and rallied in amounts and numbers far exceeding such other GOP hopefuls as Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. Paul's fans gave nearly as much money to their campaign as those other two candidates combined.
The Goldwater movement in 1960 was seen as too young, too radical and too outside the mainstream by the GOP establishment of its day.
The religious right during the 1988 Pat Robertson campaign was seen as an overly loud and pushy minority.
But just as those minorities grew and dominated the GOP, the libertarian-leaning energy of the Ron Paul movement is primed to shape the future of the Republican Party. With their unique seriousness about reining in a government drowning in debt, neither the Republican Party nor the country can afford to ignore the concerns of Paul's devotees.

What kind of tree would you most like to become? A maple tree, a gingko - or perhaps an oak tree?
Ever more people are pondering that question - and not just for fun. At least, that's according to Roger Moline.  They are the founder of "Urnabios," a company that produces urns that turn into trees over time.
The urns themselves are biodegradable and aside from human ashes, they also contain seeds. This allows human remains to turn into new, green life within a few years.
With Moline having already sold more than 20,000 of their eco-urns, this indicates a trend: ecological interments are on the rise. And for those who feel that turning yourself into a tree is a bit too radical, there is still the option of being buried under one: In Germany alone, there are more than 300 forest spaces established for natural burials.
An oasis of quiet makes for a fitting final resting place
A forest's silence
Jana Giess of "FriedWald" - Germany's largest and oldest company specializing in natural burials - agrees that growing numbers of people are becoming interested in alternative forms of interment. As many as 54,000 people are already buried in FriedWald's forests, while another 135,000 have registered for and planned their tree burials while still alive.
"The open sky, the trees, the air, the rustling of the leaves, the chirping of the birds: many people find that comforting," said Geiss. "Those are moments that you don't usually experience in a regular cemetery," they added.
Often people who have a particular love of nature choose to have their ashes buried in woodland burial grounds, says Giess. These people are dog owners, hikers, forest-lovers - but they may also simply find conventional cemeteries depressing.
A simple plaque memorializes a loved one who has passed on
You won't find any crosses in a woodland burial ground. Instead, names are memorialized with a discreet name plate attached to the tree.
There is no need to care for the flowers or other plantings at the grave, which would otherwise be customary at German cemeteries. At a woodland burial ground, things are supposed to be as natural as possible.
There, you will see moss, ferns, wildflowers, and - depending on the season - foliage or snow. For many people, the fact that relatives aren't required to care for grave sites for decades to come is another good reason to opt for interment at a natural burial ground.
Giving back to nature
But pragmatic reasons and a love of nature during one's lifetime aren't the only things behind the trend, thinks Hannah Rumble. The British anthropologist spent several years researching why people opt for a natural burial in designated forests and meadows. In the end - the final end - it's about giving something back.
"Because the body isn't embalmed, because the graves are shallower and the coffins are biodegradable, the body becomes a source of new life," Rumble said. Making the decomposition process "a source for new life, the earth or trees - that comforts people tremendously," the anthropologist believes.
Ashes become new life with the Spiritree
In one sense, it's a way to extend life. Instead of viewing life and death as dualistic opposites, people who want to be buried in nature imagine life and death as a continuum. The end of one life heralds a new one - death then becomes more about lifecycles, Hannah Rumble said.
This close-to-nature attitude; the desire to be absorbed by nature and to "recycle" oneself so concretely also has something to do with changing attitudes and lifestyles - including environmental awareness - Rumble thinks.
"The idea of a natural burial no longer sounds strange - people can relate to it, because similar ideas on recycling have become common in other aspects of our lives," Rumble told DW.
Rediscovering ancient practices
The concept of interment in nature is only novel to a certain extent: such practices have occurred for millennia.
But in the thoroughly structured form in which it is practiced today, the concept is still fairly new. FriedWald was founded in Switzerland 20 years ago, and has only operated in Germany since 2001.
People buried there aren't necessarily atheists, Giess clarified. "Many funerals are accompanied by Christian rituals," they said.
Saving the Earth - and some cash
The cost of an interment under a tree in a woodland burial ground starts at 770 euros (around $840) - however, in that case you'd have to share the tree with strangers. A tree for your own family with up to 10 plots costs 3,350 euros or more, depending on the location, view and type of tree.
That's still much cheaper than the several thousand euros a standard burial typically costs.
In German culture, maple trees are considered a symbol of freedom
Those who don't want to have their ashes buried under an already fully grown tree, but instead want their relatives to plant a new tree over their remains, get a better deal: Roger Moline's biodegradable urns with integrated seeds cost just under 150 euros.
Most people who are interested in being buried in the woods pick a tree in advance. And then, only one question remains: which kind of tree to feed your remains. According to Roger Moline, most people opt for a maple.
Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan's decision to ban app-based ojek (motorcycle taxis) should be seen as a government effort to create a safe transportation system in the capital city, according to an observer.
Transportation observer Darmaningtyas said on Friday that motorcycles were not safe vehicles, so the government should prohibit their use as public transportation gradually, starting with the areas where public transportation has been well-operated so public activities will not be disrupted.
'Jonan's decision was not wrong,' Darmaningtyas told thejakartapost.com.
They said that from 2010 to 2014, police recorded that 133,651 people had died in traffic accidents, meaning about 73 people died everyday because of accidents and more than 70 percent of them involved motorcycles.
'Whether it is application-based or conventional ojek, it is an anomaly in the transportation system in Indonesia,' they asserted.
Darmaningtyas said that ojek appeared because of shabby public transportation, adding that it is the government's duty to improve the system to become safe, comfortable, expeditious and affordable.
They added that it is not the intelligent transportation system (ITS) that should be contested, but the use of motorcycles as public transportation.
'E-ticketting for Transjakarta and commuter lines are also technology applications. ITS is not prohibited. It is the usage of motorcycles for public transportation that should be prohibited,' Darmaningtyas said.
They said that conventional ojek and application-based ojek should consistently be disciplined. However, when public transportation in certain areas is not ready, a ban by the government is not yet needed.
Indonesian Consumer Foundation (YLKI) chairperson Tulus Abadi said that ojek are not necessarily banned.
'It is right that basically ojek are not in line with the transportation law in Indonesia. Based on the law, public transportation must have minimum of three wheels. However, ojek have been allowed to operate for a very long time,' Tulus said.
They added that the government must not prohibit the operation of ojek if the government is still not capable of providing access to safe public transportation. Tulus pointed at a fatal Metromini crash that happened in early December.
'The government must not just prohibit without providing any solutions,' they said.
Minister Jonan earlier issued a letter that banned the operation of ride-hailing applications since they do not fulfill the requirements to be official public transportation, such as having yellow plates and meeting safety standards. Law No. 22/2009 also stipulates that two-wheeled vehicles were not designated for public transportation.
This letter incited public objections and even attracted President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo's attention. Jonan was scheduled to meet President this afternoon to discuss the matter.
Jonan annulled the decision on the same day President Jokowi called him. (dan)(+)
HUNTINGDON VALLEY, PA — A New Jersey man downloaded and shared child pornography videos from their mother's home in Huntingdon Valley, the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office announced.
Eric D. MacAfee, 41, of Seaside Heights, New Jersey faces felony charges of dissemination of child pornography, sexual abuse of children, and related counts, the DA said.
An investigation began on July 5 when Abington Township detectives used electronic surveillance to uncover a computer using a file sharing network specifically designed to anonymously share files, according to authorities.
When undercover detectives connected to the computer in question, they received five video files showing underaged children engaged in sexual acts, police said.
An investigation ultimately traced the computer to MacAfee's mother's home in Huntingdon Valley, the DA said.
When police arrived, MacAfeewas not there. They were arrested in Seaside Heights on Oct. 4 and their computer was seized.
Bail was set at $75,000 and they were remanded to Montgomery County Correctional Facility after failing to post.
A preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 13.

“It's going on big time,” said Brad Cole, president of Cole Partners Asset Management in Chicago, which runs a fund of hedge funds focused on natural resources. “There is considerable interest in what we call ‘owning structure' — like United States farmland, Argentine farmland, English farmland — wherever the profit picture is improving.”
These new bets by big investors could bolster food production at a time when the world needs more of it.
The investors plan to consolidate small plots of land into more productive large ones, to introduce new technology and to provide capital to modernize and maintain grain elevators and fertilizer supply depots.
But the long-term implications are less clear. Some traditional players in the farm economy, and others who study and shape agriculture policy, say they are concerned these newcomers will focus on profits above all else, and not share the industry's commitment to farming through good times and bad.
“Farmland can be a bubble just like Florida real estate,” said Jeffrey Hainline, president of Advance Trading, a 28-year-old commodity brokerage firm and consulting service in Bloomington, Ill. “The cycle of getting in and out would be very volatile and disruptive.”
By owning land and other parts of the agricultural business, these new investors are freed from rules aimed at curbing the number of speculative bets that they and other financial investors can make in commodity markets. “I just wonder if they need some sheep's clothing to put on,” Mr. Hainline said.
Mark Lapolla, an adviser to institutional investors, is also a bit wary of the potential disruption this new money could cause. “It is important to ask whether these financial investors want to actually operate the means of production — or simply want to have a direct link into the physical supply of commodities and thereby reduce the risk of their speculation,” they said.

Grain elevators, especially, could give these investors new ways to make money, because they can buy or sell the actual bushels of corn or soybeans, rather than buying and selling financial derivatives that are linked to those commodities.
When crop prices are climbing, holding inventory for future sale can yield higher profits than selling to meet current demand, for example. Or if prices diverge in different parts of the world, inventory can be shipped to the more profitable market.
“It's a huge disadvantage to not be able to trade the physical commodity,” said Andrew J. Redleaf, founder of Whitebox Advisors, a hedge fund management firm in Minneapolis.
Mr. Redleaf bought several large grain elevator complexes from ConAgra and Cargill last year for a long-term stake in what they see as a high-growth business. The elevators can store 36 million bushels of grain.

“We discovered that our lease customers, major food company types, are really happy to see us, because they are apt to see Cargill and ConAgra as competitors,” they said.
The executives making such bets say that fears about their new role are unfounded, and that their investments will be a plus for farming and, ultimately, for consumers.
“The world is asking for more food, more energy. You see a huge demand,” said Axel Hinsch, chief executive of Calyx Agro, a division of the giant Louis Dreyfus Commodities, which is buying tens of thousands of acres of cropland in Brazil with the backing of big institutional investors, including AIG Investments.

“What this new investment will buy is more technology,” Mr. Hinsch said. “We will be helping to accelerate the development of infrastructure, and the consumer will benefit because there will be more supply.”
Financial investors also can provide grain elevator operators the money they need to weather today's more volatile commodity markets. When wild swings in prices become common, as they are now, elevator operators have to put up more cash to lock in future prices. John Duryea, co-portfolio manager of the Ospraie Special Opportunity Fund, is buying 66 grain elevators with a total capacity of 110 million bushels from ConAgra for $2.1 billion. The deal, expected to close by the end of June, also will give Ospraie a stake in 57 fertilizer distribution centers and the barges and ships necessary to keep them supplied with low-cost imports.

Maintaining these essential services “helps bring costs down to the farmers,” Mr. Duryea said. “That has to help mitigate the price increases for crops.”
Mr. Duryea of the Ospraie fund dismissed the idea that financial investors, with obligations to suppliers and customers of their elevators and fertilizer services, would put their thumb on the supply-demand scale by holding back inventory to move prices artificially.
“It is not in our best interests for anyone to be negatively affected by what we do,” they said.
Perhaps the most ambitious plans are those of Susan Payne, founder and chief executive of Emergent Asset Management, based near London.
Emergent is raising $450 million to $750 million to invest in farmland in sub-Saharan Africa, where it plans to consolidate small plots into more productive holdings and introduce better equipment. Emergent also plans to provide clinics and schools for local labor.
One crop and a source of fuel for farming operations will be jatropha, an oil-seed plant useful for biofuels that is grown in sandy soil unsuitable for food production, Ms. Payne said.
“We are getting strong response from institutional investors — pensions, insurance companies, endowments, some sovereign wealth funds,” they said.
The fund chose Africa because “land values are very, very inexpensive, compared to other agriculture-based economies,” they said. “Its microclimates are enticing, allowing a range of different crops. There's accessible labor. And there's good logistics — wide open roads, good truck transport, sea transport.”
The Emergent fund is one of a growing roster of farmland investment funds based in Britain.
Last October, the London branch of BlackRock introduced the BlackRock Agriculture Fund, aiming to raise $200 million to invest in fertilizer production, timberland and biofuels. The fund currently stands at more than $450 million.

Braemar Group, near Manchester, is investing exclusively in Britain. “Britain is a nice, stable northwestern European economy with the same climate and quality of soil as northwestern Europe,” said Marc Duschenes, Braemar's chief executive. “But our land is at a 50 percent discount to Ireland and Denmark. We just haven't caught up yet.“
Europe, like the United States, is facing mandated increases in biofuel production, they said, and cropland near new ethanol facilities in the northeast of England will be the first source of supply. “No one is going to put a ton of grain on a boat in Latin America and ship it to the northeast of England to turn it into bioethanol,” they said.
For Gary R. Blumenthal, chief executive of World Perspectives, an agriculture consulting firm in Washington, the new investments by big financial players, if sustained, could be just what global agriculture needs — “where you can bring small, fragmented pieces together to boost the production side of agriculture.”
They added: “Investment funds are seeing that this consolidation brings value to them. But I'm saying this brings value to everyone.”
On Thursday night (April 28), 31 collegiate football players walked across the stage in Chicago's Auditorium Theatre as NFL teams selected them in the first round of the league's professional draft. While those watching at home will hear analysis, interviews and reporting before and after picks are made, the players are allowed to select their own walk-up music once commissioner Roger Goodell calls their name, and many decided to soundtrack the moment with hip-hop.
From the very first pick, rap was the go-to choice, as Jared Goff, who played college ball at California and was drafted by the L.A. Rams, selected Tupac and Dr. Dre's "California Love" as their walk-up music. Below is a list of players who walked up to rap songs, sorted by the order in which they were selected, with their positions and new teams included in parenthesis. Further down is a shorter list of players who have yet to be selected, but nonetheless have chosen a hip-hop song and were included on the NFL's list of musical assignments .
1. Jared Goff (QB, Los Angeles Rams) - "California Love," 2Pac
4. Ezekiel Elliott (RB, Dallas Cowboys) - "Hiroller," Lil Uzi Vert
5. Jalen Ramsey (CB, Jacksonville Jaguars) - "Ultralight Beam," Kanye West
6. Ronnie Stanley (OT, Baltimore Ravens) - "Wicked," Future
10. Eli Apple (CB, New York Giants) - "Magnificent," Rick Ross
11. Vernon Hargreaves (CB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers) - "Last Breath," Future
13. Laremy Tunsil (OT, Miami Dolphins) - "Thankful," Kodak Black

Álvaro Martínez, presidente del Deportivo Cali, aseguró que las negociaciones del Atlético de Madrid por Rafael Santos Borré están muy avanzadas:
"Lo de Rafael Santos Borré está prácticamente definido para el Atlético de Madrid, que comprará el ciento por ciento de los derechos del jugador y nos lo cederá durante un año", afirmó el dirigente.
Además, agregó que la intención de dejarlo hasta 2016 es la participación en la Copa Libertadores: "Nos acompañará en la Liga y la Libertadores del próximo año, y si llegáramos a las semifinales o finales de la Copa, el jugador también las disputaría con nosotros", dijo Martínez.
De igual forma, el presidente dijo que también hubo la opción para que Santos Borré fuera cedido a otro equipo español: "En principio se planteó que fuera a préstamo al Rayo Vallecano, pero, hasta ahora, sin haberse firmado el contrato, en lugar de ir al Rayo se quedaría en el Deportivo Cali. Creería que entre este sábado y el lunes firmará el contrato".
After spending a whole week eating nothing but food found in dumpsters of grocery stores, Rob Greenfield hosted a dinner party at their home in Ocean Beach on Friday, December 20. With the goal to educate people of how much food goes to waste in America, Greenfield is working on a short film named 21 Gourmet Dumpster Meals to inspire people to eat healthier and be less wasteful.
Reportedly, one in six Americans lack a secure supply of food to their tables, though in reality, America produces enough food to feed itself and three other Americas. We throw away 90 billion pounds of food per year, or roughly $165 billion worth of food, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Though Greenfield can easily afford to buy food and not eat from dumpsters, they do it to draw attention to the food crisis in this country.
“Friday's dumpster dinner was a total blast. About 30 people showed up, some who heard about it on the news, some from reddit, and a bunch of friends. Not a single person could tell the food came from the dumpster; most of them said it was above and beyond their expectations….
“As for the dinner, we made an eggplant-mushroom frittata, veggie pot pie, rosemary-roasted potatoes and carrots, pumpkin, and Delicata squash soup, mashed sweet potatoes, mango guacamole, and a fruit salad, among many Trashetizers [trash appetizers].”
With more food than they could possibly eat or share with their friends, they prepared a big pot of home-made soup and a couple dozen freshly prepared fried-egg sandwiches and gave them to anyone that wanted a meal outside the post office in downtown San Diego the morning before their dinner event. That's where they met Lee, an older guy who was not interested in their food, but had something to say about the camera that was documenting Greenfield's charitable act.
“If you really want to understand, why don't you come live on the streets with me?” Lee scolded Greenfield after they explained that the camera was there for a documentary about food waste in America.
Amused by their response, Greenfield accepted the challenge of living on the streets with Lee. Greenfield prepared themselves to spend Christmas week on the corner of 16th and Island, where Lee said they could be found.
With the intention of showing that the differences between the “homeless” and the “home dwellers” are minimal compared to the similarities, Greenfield said they would spend the holidays penniless out in the cold.
Sec. 179 - What I Really Think
Ok, let's talk about this IRS Section 179 thing. This is getting ridiculous.
After seemingly endless chatter and numerous stops and starts throughout 2014, it appeared on Wednesday of this week (Dec. 3rd) that Congress FINALLY was going get its act together and do something in regards to extending the popular business tax relief clause that allows for immediate write-off of any business asset (new or used) purchase. The House passed legislation overwhelmingly (378-46) on Wednesday, a series of tax breaks that included bumping the IRS Sec. 179 write off limit back up to $500,000 (where it was in 2013) and making it good through Dec. 31, 2014.
So, finally, we're good, right?
Nope. Yesterday and today the Senate had it's say and now the best word is that they will vote on it next week. AgWeb.com's Alison Rice has led the way reporting on the latest developments this week. Here's a link to their latest update, filed Friday afternoon:
http://www.agweb.com/article/senate-vote-expected-on-section-179-next-week-alison-rice/
Look, I've got no stake in this. I've just been reporting on auction sale prices and used farm and construction equipment values for 25 years now. But the way this has been handled by our representatives in Washington, for a number of years now, is just plain…I come to my best description: utterly ridiculous.
Remember the “Fiscal Cliff” deal? I know, we all try to forget the nonsense back in the height of the US vs. them right/left stagnation in our capital. But on January 2, 2013 Congress passed and the President signed legislation that pushed the IRS Sec. 179 write off limit back up to an all-time high of $500,000 for immediate write-off of any business asset purchased…but the kicker (unbelievable) was it also worked retroactively for 2012.
“Oh, so now that it's 2013 you're telling me I can write off my equipment purchases I made last year? Thanks. Thanks a lot.”
Makes no sense. None. We deserve better.
However you view this bit of national tax policy, encouraging business investment via a very significant tax write off, whether you think it's good for our country or hurtful long term…how can ANYONE think it's wise, good, or beneficial, in any way, to pass legislation that works retroactively, or to CONTINUALLY string policy decisions along? This whole “kicking the can down the road” mode of operation our “leaders” in Washington have fallen into has to stop. Seriously, it has to stop. We're just making the mess worse for our kids and their kids in the years to come. They will figure it out and will thrive. We're just making it harder and harder for them.
Pick a policy and go with it. Make a decision. Set a course. Quit thinking micro SHORT term and begin to think LONG term. When you boil it down, to me this is our culture's chief challenge and this issue we're talking about here, the IRS Sec. 179 clauses is symptomatic ….no one looks beyond what's right in front of their nose.
American business and the American farmer are the best operators in the world. Let's quit making it harder on them than it has been, than it should be, than it is right now. How can you be expected to make good, sound, informed LONG-term biz decisions when you don't know the rules? Can I write this off? How much? Maybe I can't? When will I know?
Ugh.
The past couple days have been something. Wednesday morning I got a text from a prominent Midwestern auctioneer. They were on site early in the morning prepping for a very large farm machinery sale…”Pete, what have you heard on Sec 179?” The number of times the phrase “Sec 179” comes up in conversations I've had with farmers, implement dealers and and ag lenders here the past 6 weeks? Every time nearly. “Pete, what have you heard?”
The unknown is not good for any biz. In lieu of the “known”, confusion and uncertainty reign. Is this the economic climate we want to foster? For the good of our country in a hyper competitive 24/7 world we live in now? Insanity if you ask me. Time to stop it.
I don't care whether our reps in Washington are right, left, red, blue, Republicans, Democrats, Independants, conservatives or liberals. Like a crusty old dude in my hometown of Benson, MN used to say all the time….”It doesn't matter”…..just do your job. Tackle issues. Make decisions. Set a course….with LONG term vision behind it. Then let American business and American agriculture do what it does best….assess, adjust, plan, then kick butt.
Before I wash my hands and quit wasting ink writing about Washington…let me just say this. I, and I SO many other Americans out there are eagerly waiting for, clamboring, neigh STARVING for, any politician, from either side of the aisle, to come out and say….”I don't care if you re-elect me. That's not my focus. I'm here to do a job. I realize I won't get my way all the time, that's ok. Let's tackle issues head on with a LONG term vision. Let's work TOGETHER.”
Whoever says and does that…got my vote. And LOTS of other votes. My continual hope is that someone will figure that out…light bulb…”ah, now I see.”
Back to the topic of IRS Sec. 179 I can report to you that this business investment carrot is beyond powerful. Our auction sale price data shows, without any doubt, that prices have gone UP each of the past 11 years in the 4th Qtr. Why? You know why…..taxes, farmers looking to buy equipment to help minimize their tax bills. So in terms of the Sec. 179 clauses being a very powerful job creation mechanism to foster business related sales…I don't think any question there, it makes the money flow.
That said, you can certainly argue this “pedal to the metal” tax policy we've had since the initial Bush Tax Cuts of 2002 can and has had consequences, some of which, though unintended, have a wicked boomerang effect. The piper always gets paid...think about implement dealer lots and all the 1, 2, 3-year old large late model used equipment items traded in that are now just sitting there. An on-going issue.
But first things first, let's address the issue and set a course. And then let American businesses and American farmers make their own informed decisions on how they choose to run and grow their operations.
The can has been kicked long enough. We're tired of that road.

With the holidays around the corner I know everyone is looking for stuff to buy! So here's our list of awesome stuff for animators. Enjoy!
Books
This book is an animator's bible. It thoroughly covers the basics of spacing, timing, walks, runs, weight, anticipation, overlapping action, takes, stagger, dialogue, animal animation and much more. It's not called a “survival kit” for nothing. This book will teach you EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW to start your training as an animator.
Richard Williams is an academy award-winning director responsible for hits such as “Who Framed Roger Rabbit”, “The Pink Panther” and more. They got their training from animation greats such as Milt Kahl and other old-time Disney animators.
Originally released in 1994, Cartoon Animation (also known as “The Preston Blair Book”), has been an amazing reference source for creating cartoon-style animation. With this book you'll learn how to develop a cartoon character, create dynamic movement, and animate dialogue with action. This book focuses on character development and covers topics such as creating compelling lines of action, timing, dialogue and more. This is a great book for animal animation since it shows in detail many examples of animating different types of cartoon animals.
Preston Blair was a predominant animator in their time and worked in many big studios such as Disney and Hanna Barbera. They worked on famous scenes in the original Fantasia such as the Sorcerer's Apprentice and the hippo – alligator dance.
This is not just a pretty book to have on your shelf so you can look professional. I mean, it is pretty, but it is also extremely thorough in what it's trying to tell. This book has started as an animation guide and turned into a detailed survey on the progression of animation, both within the Disney studios and in the world of animation in general. Written by two of the nine old men who defined the Disney animation style, this book takes the reader through all the steps it took them to discover and research the best methods of animation. there are great concepts to learn from this book, but it is also important to know the history of how animation came to be, and this book covers both in amazing depth.
Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, two out of Disney's nine old men, worked at Disney since the earliest days and contributed to films such as Snow White, Pinocchio and The Jungle book.
If you're at all interested in the world of animation (and I assume you are) you must read this book written by Pixar's president Ed Catmull.
If you're starting out as a filmmaker you HAVE to read this book. It covers all the great camera angles, shots and moves you need to know.
You might be looking for a gift for a fellow animator/animation fan, or maybe you are one yourself. Either way this book is an awesome purchase. It includes concept art and color palettes from almost all of the Pixar films. Great for inspiration and learning. Also looks pretty darn good on the shelf.
This book (produced and written for Bloop Animation) is a step-by-step guide to becoming an animator (even if you've never animated before.)
I basically wrote the book I wish I had when I was starting up with animation. It has all the information a person needs to find their way towards starting a career in animation.
It covers all the different types of animation and basic animation principles. It comes with a complete hardware and software guide (for 2D, 3D and stop motion), must-have books as well as a detailed list of the best animation schools with all their information.
It also has plenty of practical guides such as creating an effective demo reel, building your own portfolio website, how to get a job in the animation industry and even a step-by-step guide to making an animated short.
Tablets
This is small yet fantastic tablet (formerly known as the Bamboo) is the best way to start using a tablet when you're just a beginner and don't know if you want to spend much money. It's small but not so small that it can't be used for professional work. It's wireless, has a touch screen, 1024 pressure levels, and if you want to spend an extra $100 you can get a larger size.
The best tablet for 3D animators, and the most commonly used tablet. The medium one ($349) is the most popular Wacom tablet and is the perfect size for most uses. It's great for free drawing straight to programs like Photoshop or Flash and also for animating in 3D program like Maya and Cinema 4D. It has 2048 pressure levels, a touch screen and awesome programable buttons. This is the tablet I use, and unless you focus on heavy drawing this is my most recommended choice for most people.
The Cintiq is Wacom's high-end product line, featuring an amazing HD screen to be used as a tablet and as a secondary
screen. This tablet is mostly for professional 2D animators or digital painters. The model I recommend is the Cintiq 13HD ($999),
since 13” feels like the perfect size for most uses. It's not too bulky or too small.
Accessories
Wacom's stylus for the iPad. Works better than any generic stylus out there and even have pressure sensitivity. Great for drawing on the go.
This nicely designed pencil has a different take on drawing on the iPad. It has a hard tip and it's meant to be used with the amazing drawing app – Paper and was made by the same company who made the app.
A great sketchbook by the superb designers of Moleskine.
The Palomino pencils feature a firm and smooth graphite core that is ideal for writing, sketching and everyday use. Its firm, dark lead holds a point and lays down a line like no other pencil on the market.
The MX mouse series by Logitech are by far the most comfortable ones I've used.
A slick, stunning premium mouse pad. For the design oriented people.
A great all-around microphone for most types of vocal recordings. This is what I use to record all of my tutorials.
Misc.
This amazing workhorse is the newest addition to my studio and it is AMAZING. It's extremely powerful, and that display is gorgeous. The price is actually pretty good too, surprisingly, since many 4K display monitors can cost just as much (and they don't come with an amazing computer inside.) Definitely for the pros out there.
All your coffee needs in one. Espresso and regular coffee (with some awesome crema.) An animator's best friend.
Once in a while I run into something cool that I just gotta share with you guys.
Disney, in honor of their nine greatest animators from the golden age of animation, has released a box set collection with 9 flip books, each dedicated to one of the nine old men (Les Clark, Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, John Lounsbery, Ward Kimball, Ollie Johnston, Mark Davis, Wolfgang Reitherman, and Milt Kahl).
Each flip book features one of their famous shots from classic Disney movies like Bambi, Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland.
This is a neat little package that every animator/Disney fan should have on their shelf.
All of Adobe's programs with a single monthly payment. If you take your art seriously this is one of the most important tools in your arsenal. I use many of their programs so often that it's really great to be able to access them all in this new modern subscription-based way.

In my recent exchange with the Department of Education regarding President Obama's remarks critical of our obsession with testing, it became clear that there is a vast expansion of testing on the horizon. Few reports have emerged that describe this, and I fear the public may be unaware of the resources that soon will be diverted from our already decimated classrooms. I asked two of the nation's experts on this trend to share what they have learned about this recently. Here is their report.
by Stephen Krashen and Susan Ohanian
When the plans to create Common Core Standards were announced, Secretary Duncan told us that it would be accompanied by assessments to enforce the standards. We were also told that developing standards would be relatively inexpensive, but developing assessments, by contrast, will be a "very heavy lift financially" (USA Today, June 14, 2009).
It is gradually becoming clear that the lift will be extremely heavy. The new tests will be computer-based, administered online, and "will make widespread use of smart technology. They will provide students with realistic, complex performance tasks, immediate feedback, computer adaptive testing, and incorporate accommodations for a range of students" (Duncan, 2010). Duncan noted that "with the benefit of technology, assessment questions can incorporate audio and video. Problems can be situated in real-world environments, where students perform tasks or include multi-stage scenarios and extended essays."
An example:
The National Education Technology Plan 2010 (U.S. Department of Education; Office of Educational Technology) describes one kind of testing that is being developed, testing that takes place "in the course of learning" (xvii) and that tries to find out what students are thinking while doing projects:
As students work, the system can capture their inputs and collect evidence of their problem-solving sequences, knowledge, and strategy use, as reflected by the information each student selects or inputs, the number of attempts the student makes, the number of hints and type of feedback given, and the time allocation across parts of the problem.
(pages 29-30: "Assessing during online learning").
Aside from the mind-control aspect of this kind of testing, how much will it cost, in addition to the cost of developing, testing and revising the new tests?
If we are going to have computer-based tests, and if they are to be delivered to students via the internet, the first requirement is that all students need to be connected to the internet. A recent article in the New York Times gives us some idea of what will be involved. The article begins by noting that money is scarce these days:
Despite sharp drops in state aid, New York City's Department of Education plans to increase its technology spending, including $542 million next year alone that will primarily pay for wiring and other behind-the-wall upgrades to city schools ... and $315 million for additional schools by 2014...
(New York Times, "In city schools, tech spending to rise despite cuts," March 30, 2011)
Buried deep the article is a statement by "city officials" that the huge expenditures for technology are primarily to make it possible for students to take computerized national standardized tests.
We can expect this to happen nation-wide. If the New York figure is extrapolated to the entire country, the cost to connect all children to the internet will be at least 50 times the cost of connecting New York City alone, or $25 billion (New York City enrolls one million students, the USA as a whole, over 60 million). This is only to connect students to the internet. The whistles and bells needed to do "computer adaptive testing" with audio and video will cost more.
Technology, of course, continues to develop all the time, and consumers have repeatedly demonstrated their willingness to discard the old and embrace the new, even at considerable expense. We can expect that after every student is connected, sooner or later the set-up will become obsolete and need to be replaced, either in part or totally. The schools, we predict, will cheerfully pay up, eager for the "newest" technology, and the computer companies will cheerfully accept their money.
The billions spent so that students can take national tests will have a huge payoff for the entire computer industry in other ways. This was enthusiastically announced by Education Secretary Duncan's Chief of Staff and former CEO of the New Schools Venture Fund, Joanne Weiss. Weiss noted that because all students will have internet access in order to be tested, technology companies can now profit from one giant national market for all their educational products:
The development of common standards and shared assessments radically alters the market for innovation in curriculum development, professional development, and formative assessments. Previously, these markets operated on a state-by-state basis, and often on a district-by-district basis. But the adoption of common standards and shared assessments means that education entrepreneurs will enjoy national markets where the best products can be taken to scale
(Weiss, 2011).
WHY THIS IS A BAD IDEA
We have nothing against private enterprise making an honest profit for providing a needed service or useful product. But in this case there is no evidence that the product is needed nor is there evidence that it will be useful. Just because something is high-tech doesn't mean it is good. As Gerald Bracey pointed out, computers have made it possible to do in nano-seconds what shouldn't be done at all. We are about to waste a gigantic amount of money when it is badly needed elsewhere, and where it can be put to much better use.
No Evidence for Standards/Test Approach
First, there is no evidence supporting the idea that tests to enforce national standards, no matter how subtle and refined, will have any positive impact on student learning. In fact, the evidence we have suggests that it will not: States that use more high-stakes tests do not do better on the NAEP tests than states with fewer (Nichols, Glass and Berliner, 2006), and the use of the standardized SAT does not predict college success over and above high school grades (Bowen, Chingos, and McPherson, 2009; Geiser and Santelices, 2007).
Of course, the administration has argued that these will be new and better tests, more sensitive to growth in learning, able to chart student progress through the year, and able to probe real learning, not just memorization. Before unleashing these "improved" tests on the country, however, there should be rigorous investigation, rigorous studies to show that these measures are worth the investment. Right now, the corporations and politicians insist that we take on faith the claim that these tests are good for students. Such claims exhibit a profound lack of accountability.
Second, there is overwhelming evidence that dealing with poverty is an excellent investment, one that will not only improve school achievement but also affect quality of life and personal happiness.
• There is very good evidence that our international tests scores are "low" because of poverty. Studies show that middle-class American students in well-funded schools score at the top of the world on international tests. Our overall average is less than spectacular because we have such a high percentage of children living in poverty, at least 20%, the highest among all industrialized countries (Berliner, 2011). In urban areas, where test scores are the lowest, the poverty level is much higher: 51% in Cleveland and Detroit, 37% in Miami, and 35% in Dallas and New Orleans. (These figures are based on the federal poverty level. If we consider the percentage of children eligible for free and reduced lunch, between 130 and 185% of the federal level, the figure is much higher, with 81% of children in Detroit and 68% in Miami living in poverty. According to the National Center for Children in Poverty (see e.g. here), families need an income of twice (200%) the official federal level to meet basic needs. Nearly 40% of children in the US live in families with incomes of less than 200% of the official federal level.)
Studies show that children living in poverty suffer from conditions shown to impact educational attainment and school performance, such as "food insecurity," environmental toxins, lack of health care, and lack of access to books. The impact of these factors is enormous: No matter how good teaching is or how carefully a curriculum is put together, it will be of little value when students are hungry, malnourished, in poor health, and when they have little or no access to reading material.
• When these conditions are dealt with and alleviated, school performance improves. Providing food for hungry children has been shown to produce dramatic differences in behavior and performance in school (Berliner, 2009), having medical insurance improves school performance (Berliner, 2009), and increasing access to books as well as providing time to read for pleasure results in better literacy development (Shin and Krashen, 2009).
The obvious cure for poverty is full employment, with a living wage paid for honest work. Our society today provides neither of these, with unemployment high and with wages low: As of this writing, the average pay for a retail sales position, about $20,000 per year, is well below the federal poverty line for a family of four (Gibson, 2011).
The obvious step to take now is to make sure children are protected from the effects of poverty. A great deal of this, e.g. improving libraries in high poverty areas to the point where children of poverty have access to a print-rich environment, can be done at a fraction of the cost schools will be required to spend just on the technology aspect of the new testing program.
The Department of Education plans to use American students as experimental subjects to try out an extremely expensive, time-consuming and dubious testing program that will engulf classrooms. If it fails, the effect on students will be devastating, with schools robbed of money, and a generation of students poorly educated, teacher professionalism subsumed by data management, and schools robbed of funds for anything but technology repair. But the testing and technology companies will win, profiting regardless of the success or failure of their products and always ready to convince us that the next versions will be better.
The DOE's stubborn refusal to even consider dealing with poverty as a means of improving school performance, their insistence of "rigor" and "accountability" in testing students but willingness to give testing and technology companies a free ride, and their enthusiasm about opening new and profitable opportunities to "education entrepreneurs" is highly suspicious behavior. It raises the possibility that DOE policy is designed to profit a small part of the private sector, not the 60 million students in our public schools.
Update: This post by former test-scorer Todd Farley offers additional insights into the process underway to develop tests for the Common Core Standards.

Shocking footage of the violent groups that target gay men and lesbian women in Russia will reveal the dangerous levels of homophobia in the country in the runup to the Sochi Winter Olympics this week.
A Channel 4 documentary, Hunted, to be broadcast in the Dispatches strand on Wednesday at 10pm, will include the first television reporting of the concerted intimidation and humiliation carried out by the anti-gay groups Parents of Russia and Occupy Paedophilia.
"We filmed these groups with their knowledge, and what I found shocking afterwards was that only a few asked to have their faces disguised. They all believe they are doing the right thing," said Liz Mackean, the investigative journalist who travelled to Russia to make the film for C4.
"Occupy Paedophilia has groups in more than 30 cities. They operate with impunity and under the cover of the remarks [Vladimir] Putin has made suggesting that children are at risk from homosexuals," Mackean added. The film shows the gangs using the internet to lure potential victims to meetings, before threatening violence to force confessions or humiliating acts. One victim is persuaded to dance and is filmed for the internet.
"Occupy Paedophilia deliberately blurs the lines between paedophilia and homosexuality," said Tom Porter, commissioning editor of the documentary. "During one of the filmed incidents of humiliation, the group asked our cameraman and director, Ben Steele, to stop filming, but they continued partly because they were concerned that if they stopped there would be violence."
In another sequence, Timur Isav, a self-styled crusading member of Parents of Russia, is shown attending a lesbian and gay event and handing out bags containing a length of rope, with the intention of suggesting they commit suicide.
C4 is also broadcasting the Paralympic Winter Games in March. "It just shows the way a broad channel like Channel 4 can exist," said Porter. "We are doing our investigation, while over in sport they are doing the Winter Games."
Mackean said the gay Russians they interviewed were against a boycott of the Games, because they feared it would lead to increased reprisals.
International human rights groups plan to step up their protests against Russia's anti-gay laws during the event in a bid to reverse legislation that they say is responsible for a dramatic rise in homophobic attacks.
Athlete Ally, an organisation focused on ending homophobia and transphobia in sports, is among the organisations that have called for worldwide peaceful action on Wednesday as part of a "Global Speak Out" event in support of Russian LGBT people. Wesley Adams, chief operating officer at US-based campaign group All Out, who is co-ordinating to Speak Out protests, called for everyone to wear red clothing at the events – a colourful move echoing the German national team's decision to wear rainbow-coloured kit for the Games. Adams said they want protests to take place not just at embassies but anywhere "that refers to Russia in a positive way".
Referring to the Principle Six campaign – named after the clause in the Olympic charter that supposedly guarantees non-discrimination – they said: "We also encourage people to use Principle Six messaging as a positive way to push Olympians, Olympic sponsors and the IOC to speak up.
"Principle Six of the Olympic Charter forbids discrimination of any kind, including based on sexual orientation. The Principle Six campaign uses the language of the charter to give athletes and fans a way to speak out against discrimination before and during the Sochi Olympics without breaking Russian anti-gay laws or violating the Olympic ban on political speech."
Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who will be attending the London protest at Downing Street on Wednesday evening, condemned "cowardly" Games sponsors, such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Visa, for not speaking out.
They said: "None of the corporate sponsors have explicitly condemned the Russian anti-gay law or homophobic violence in Russia. They've made only general, vague equality statements. This isn't good enough. They seem more interested in safeguarding their Russian sales than in standing up for human rights.
"I would have expected them to make a simple statement such as: 'We are deeply concerned about new Russian legislation that discriminates against the LGBT community. We deplore the homophobic violence that is taking place in Russia.' It is shameful and cowardly that they feel unable to say this."
Tatchell compared the Sochi Games with the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. "The 1936 Olympics took place in an atmosphere of antisemitic hatred incited by the Nazi government. The 2014 Sochi Olympics echo that hatred, only this time the victims of demonisation are LGBT people. There are no Nuremberg laws or concentration camps, but the hateful anti-gay propaganda is similar to the antisemitism stirred by the Nazis in the early 1930s. How can there be normal sporting relations with an abnormal regime like Putin's Russia?"
Human Rights Watch will continue to lobby officials behind the scenes this week. Hugh Williamson, director of the NGO's Europe and Central Asia division, said staff will be present at the Games getting information "on the ground" and commenting on developments.
They said: "We will continue to publish research, and lobby the IOC and Russian Olympic committee, as well as working with other LGBT groups all the way up to the Games."
The Iowa-based Religious Right group The Family Leader held a forum for Republican US Senate candidates on Friday, at which the group's view that “God instituted government” figured heavily. In fact, nearly every candidate at the debate vowed that if they were to be elected to the Senate they would block federal judicial nominees who do not follow what they perceive as “natural law” or a “biblical view of justice.”
Bob Vander Plaats, head of The Family Leader, opened the forum by declaring, “At The Family Leader, we believe God has three institutions: It would be the church, the family, and government.”
They warned that policies such as legal abortion and marriage equality would cause God to cease blessing the country. “As we have a culture that runs further and further from God's principles, Their precepts, from God's heart, it's only natural consequences that we're going to suffer,” they said.
“You cannot run away from the heart of God and expect God to bless the country,” they concluded.
Several of the candidates echoed this theme during the forum. When moderator Erick Erickson, the right-wing pundit, asked the candidates what criteria they would look for in confirming federal judges, three out of four said they would demand faith in God or adherence to “natural law.”
Sam Clovis, a college professor and retired Air Force colonel, answered that they have “a very firm litmus test” on judges: “Can that judge…explain to me natural law and natural rights?”
Joni Ernst, who is currently a state senator, agreed, adding that federal judges should understand that the Constitution and all of our laws “did come from God” and that senators should “make sure that any decisions that they have made in the past are decisions that fit within that criteria.”
Former federal prosecutor Matt Whitaker argued that neither Clovis' nor Ernst's answer had gone “far enough.” They said that they would demand that federal judicial nominees be “people of faith” and “have a biblical view of justice.”
“As long as they have that worldview, then they'll be a good judge,” they said. “And if they have a secular worldview, where this is all we have here on earth, then I'm going to be very concerned about how they judge.”
This all must have been very pleasing to Vander Plaats, who in 2010 orchestrated the ousting of Iowa Supreme Court justices who had ruled in favor of marriage equality, and who has repeatedly insisted that marriage equality is unconstitutional because it “goes against” the Bible and the “law of nature.”
Kyle Orton remains hidden away.
The Dallas Cowboys backup quarterback has yet to make an appearance at the team's voluntary offseason conditioning program, but coach Jason Garrett still expects the 31-year-old arm to resurface in due time.
The team anticipates that Orton will show for June's mandatory minicamp, but some have speculated that he'd appear solely to avoid a $70,000 fine for their absence. Asked if that might be the case, Garrett told reporters Saturday, per ESPN.com: "You'll have to ask them that."

If they choose to retire, Orton would be obliged to return $3 million of a $5 million signing bonus they received from Dallas in 2012, one core reason they might be reluctant to call it quits. If they show up in poor shape, the Cowboys can shave $3.25 million off their cap by cutting Orton after June 1, but that would leave Big D one snap away from starting the super-shaky Brandon Weeden.
"We're still hopeful that Kyle will be here," quarterback coach Wade Wilson said over the weekend, "but if they don't, we feel really good about Brandon, especially since he's going through our offseason program."
Unlike Orton, who hasn't spent a second learning Scott Linehan's adjustments to the offense. If the veteran has no intentions of playing this season, the Cowboys would be wise to begin an immediate search for higher quality help than Weeden and Caleb Hanie behind Tony Romo.

More bombs won't end the crisis in Syria. After more than six years of war, with millions displaced and a death toll of nearly half a million people, it's clear that there is no military solution to this crisis.
But for years the U.S. has bombed Syria,and last night, the U.S. expanded the war by attacking a Syrian government airbase.
Tell Congress: Don't let the U.S. escalate the war in Syria.
This week's abhorrent chemical weapons attack was an act of unspeakable violence against civilians, and we are heartbroken over the deaths of Syrians, including many children. The Trump administration's escalation is not the solution, and will only cause more killing and suffering for Syrian civilians. The U.S. should fully support the ongoing investigation of the chemical weapons attack and work with the international community to bring the perpetrators to justice.
In all decisions about the U.S. course of action, policymakers must recognize that years of direct U.S. military intervention, support of extremist armed groups, and weapons shipments to anti-government rebels in Syria have only added fuel to the fire and put Syrian civilians in greater danger.

Act now to stop the U.S. from making the crisis in Syria even worse.
Congress must take back its constitutional responsibility to decide when and if the U.S. goes to war. The Senate should stay in session and the House should return from recess to force consideration of an Authorization for the Use of Military Force, and Congress should oppose any further military action.
This tragedy further underscores the need for diplomatic solutions which engage all stakeholders. The only path toward shared security requires robust diplomacy, urgent humanitarian aid, and a comprehensive strategy to bring the crisis to an end through a political solution -- not escalating war.
War is not the answer.
In the past week, the Republican presidential nominee has been pilloried for their comments expressing openness to Russia's annexation of Crimea, has called on the Russian government to share emails it possibly hacked from Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and drawn rebukes from critics who say he's soft on a traditional US adversary.
Former CIA Director Michael Hayden became the latest heavyweight in the George W. Bush administration to lash out at Trump when they criticized the candidate Monday night for making conflicting statements about their relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"I recognize that flexibility and creativity might actually be good selling used cars and selling real estate, but when you want to be the head of an international superpower, precision and consistency are really important," Hayden told CNN's Erin Burnett.
Hayden's comments come after Trump told ABC's "This Week" on Sunday that they have no relationship with Putin -- a remark that conflicted with Trump's long history of saying the opposite and embracing Putin's praise for their candidacy.
And a new CNN/ORC poll finds that most Americans see the Russian leader differently, with nearly 6-in-10 viewing the country as unfriendly, and about half saying they think the Russian government is attempting to influence the outcome of the US presidential election.
President Barack Obama, speaking Tuesday at a White House news conference, said Russia's potential hacking of the DNC wouldn't necessarily prompt a complete freeze in relations between the the country and the United States.
Noting the FBI was still investigating the hack, Obama said cybersecurity was just another dispute on a long list between themselves and Putin.
"If, in fact, Russia engaged in this activity, it's just one on a long list of issues that me and Mr. Putin talk about," Obama said. "I don't think that it wildly swings what is a tough, difficult relationship that we have with Russia right now."
The debate over Trump's sympathy for Putin or take on world affairs is more than an esoteric squabble over foreign policy, experts said. By calling into question established structures and alliances that have held since World War II, Trump is unsettling allies and encouraging potential instability that inevitably draws the US to intervene.

In their "This Week" appearance, Trump also echoed Moscow's claim that Crimeans welcomed Russia's annexation and seemed to suggest that Russia hadn't entered Ukraine at all, telling host George Stephanopolous, "The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were."
As for Putin's foray into Ukraine, Trump said, "He's not going into Ukraine, Okay, just so you understand. He's not going to go into Ukraine, all right?"
"Well, he's already there, isn't he?" Stephanopolous replied.
Sunday's exchange came in the wake of an alleged Russian computer hack of the Democratic National Committee -- seen as an unprecedented foreign effort to interfere in a modern US election -- and Trump's own call to Russia, which they later described as "sarcastic," to help find deleted emails sent by Clinton.
And the associations that their staffers have with Russian businesses and pro-Moscow interests complicates the campaign's efforts to push back against criticism on the subject and fend off questions about the Trump team's motivations.
Trump adviser Carter Page has extensive dealings with Gazprom, the Russian state-run energy company with strong ties to Putin and their inner circle. Trump campaign chairperson Paul Manafort consulted for former Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovich, a key Putin ally, until their ouster in February 2014. In the chaotic aftermath, Russian-backed separatists seized the Crimea, a Ukrainian territory that Moscow later annexed.
In this context, Trump's comments expressing admiration for Putin are unsettling, said Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia.
Trump's comments seemingly excusing Russia's invasion of Crimea throw into question their commitment to a system that has built a relatively peaceful and prosperous post-war order, said Farkas, now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. At a time when Russia as abrogated arms control treaties and its planes are buzzing US ships in the Baltic Sea, Trump has praised Putin as a canny leader who they respect.
Since the end of WWII, there has been an existing consensus among nations that borders should not be altered by force. Russia has deviated from that twice, in Georgia in 2008 and again in Ukraine.
"The international system is set up the way it is, and has provided relative peace and prosperity for decades," Farkas said. "To violate that is shocking and the bipartisan response has been 'this can't stand.' "
"If we accept the position that big states can ride roughshod over little states, that treaties are irrelevant and that we don't care whether we have solemn commitments to allies we are encouraging further attacks against our allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East," said Stephen Blank, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council.
Whether the Crimean people welcomed Russia's invasion is irrelevant, said Blank, as "it was still a clear aggression of a country." And they noted that Trump's remarks have a potential ripple effect, providing an invitation for the estimated 25 million Russian minorities in post-Soviet states "to agitate for the dismemberment of their countries" and a return to the Russian fold.
"The international system is set up the way it is, and has provided relative peace and prosperity for decades," Farkas said. "To violate that is shocking and the bipartisan response has been 'this can't stand.' "
"The whole reason we have alliances like these is to deter countries like Russia from laying a finger on our allies. It's a way to prevent war, plain and simple," Farkas said.
Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Valeriy Chaly echoed Farkas' point Monday, telling CNN that while they didn't want to get involved in US election politics, Trump's comments concerned him.
"We count United States will be predictable, will have predictable leadership and predictable foreign policy," Chaly said.
Ariana had their first child, Lillian – Lily for short, after our mother's favorite flowers. Lily was a quiet child but content – always smiling or blinking at you as if they understood everything.
A few weeks after Lily's birth, Dad was sleeping in layer than usual. We didn't think much of it until lunchtime, when they still hadn't emerged.
I knew what it was before I went into their room. I could feel the stillness on the other side of the door and I knew.
Dad has passed on, joining our mother. The books beside them on the bed were all journals – both in their handwriting and hers. Later on, after the funeral and burial, Ari and I looked through them. Hers chronicled everything from the day they left the farm for college until the day before their death.
Some of it was mundane, some of it was about their fantastical life – their undead mother, their demon brother.
Our father's journal, however, began two weeks after Mom's funeral. Each entry was a new love letter from the other side of the grave, telling them what happened on the farm; how I was growing up; how the grandchildren were; and most of all, how much they missed them and cherished them and couldn't wait to be reunited when their time came.
Ariana was convinced Dad's ghost was lingering in that bedroom. They had taken to drinking a lot, though, and I had a feeling a lot of it was grief delusions. They hadn't been taking care of Lily since Dad's death, so I took it upon myself as one of my many, many tasks (along with caring for the animals and children while Julian worked their hectic schedule as fire chief).
I honored my mother and father a little differently than Ariana chose to. Instead of drinking, I got inked. My father had never been that great of an artist, but they had sketched up a tattoo design (of my mother, of course) they had always wanted to get.
I took it down to the tattoo parlor and got it placed on my lower back.
It wasn't long after that Ariana started having a mid-life crisis. One morning I woke up and their room was empty. Them things were gone, some of my jewelry had been taken, and all they left was Lily. They abandoned their daughter, left her, and a quickly scrawled note on the crib.
Sorry.
Some days were easier than others, of course. As time went on, I would find that some mornings all I could do was go into town, buy some flowers, and cry at my parents' graves. It was hard on me – being on the farm alone while Julian worked and the kids were at school, surrounded by a house and family grave that reeked of my beloved mother and father.
But, time heals all wounds.
…
Fennec became a strapping teen with an attitude and quicksilver tongue. They began asking about getting in contact with Beau, which we forbade them from doing quickly. They didn't get what the big deal about talking to their real dad was. I was quick to remind them that their sperm donor killed my mother and that Julian was the only man who had shown any parental guidance to them – ever. So that made Julian the real dad. That shut them up rather quickly, to my surprise.
Becca became a willowy, pale skinned and freckled beauty who looked nothing like my mixed Hispanic and everything like Beau's Irish heritage. They were sweet and quirky and still swore up and down that Jelly Bean was real. They didn't mention them too much anymore, only when prompted. I assumed they were realizing how crazy it sounded to have an imaginary friend at their age.
When I caught their kissing midair I couldn't help but laugh, which resulted in an epic melt-down type of hysterics. But not the kind I expected.
“MOM! Can't you see I need some PRIVACY?”
I rolled my eyes. Teens. “Whatever, princess,” I said as I breezed past them and into the kitchen, going for a carton of ice cream for breakfast. Weird, but I was craving it.
…
“Mom, I have the best idea.”
Oh great. I had been a lot more irritable lately, and the kids were really driving me nuts with their constant high school dramas.
“I want to go to boarding school. In France. I know it's sudden and it will cost a lot, but I don't want any birthday or Snowflake Day presents to compensate. Okay? Can I? Please?”
I blinked. Boarding School? Didn't we use to threaten Boarding School when they were younger and misbehaving? Didn't they fear it above all else?
“What school?” I asked finally.
They looked started, like they didn't expect me to ask that. “Oh. Um. LeFromage? The, um, art school?”
I narrowed my eyes. “You made that up, didn't you?”
They shook their head, their long tresses of flaming red hair spiraling around them “No! No, really, it's there. And I want to go.”
“Go where?” Fennec asked, sounding bored, as they walked past.
“Boarding School,” Becca replied quickly. “In France!”
“Why do they get to go?!” they demanded, flying into a sudden and intense rage that startled me. “I want to go!”
“Hold on, Jesus, calm down!” I exclaimed. “Why do both of you want to go?”
“Art,” Becca said quickly.
“Women,” Fennec said just as quickly.
I looked between the two of my children tiredly. “I'll ask your father,” I sighed.
Becca whooped. “He'll for sure say yes!”
…
They said yes. They left three days later on an early morning flight, excited and attempting to speak in French with what they had learned from three days of surfing the internet (and, in Fennec's case, French porn).
My children were now on a plane going to France, farther away from me than they'd ever been. It hurt my heart for them to be away from me, even though they were exhausting. It hurt to be left with only my sister's abandoned toddler and my stomach pains.
…
Julian left for another shift of three days on so they could come home for four straight days. I spent the first two days in a stupor, cleaning the house and trying to entertain Lily.
When I woke up the third morning, what I saw didn't make sense. There was some kind of dream monster looming above me, their gleaming teeth glistening with saliva. Their red eyes glowing.
I was stunned into silence as I watched them lean in and grab me by the arms, hoisting me out of the bed.
When hos mouth lowered closer to mine, their teeth dripping the spittle and, who knows, maybe venom, I began screaming. Lily, still in their crib, began to cry, their voice shrill.
The demon's mouth covered mine and I lost all consciousness.
…
“What the fuck, Ella!”
I awoke with a start, blinking blearily at Julian who looked pissed. “When was the last time you changed Lily! She's been in here screaming since I got home!”
I pulled myself up. I felt terrible, like I had been hit by a train. “What…”
Julian was shaking their head, going over to the crib and letting Lily out. “Jesus, Ella! She's been sitting in their own filth all day?! Are you on something?”
I'd never heard them so angry. I stood and trudged over, trying to take Lily from him. They batted me away. “I got this,” they said gruffly, walking them into the next room, which contained their changing table.
We were silent at dinner until the tension got to be too much. “I'm sorry,” I apologized again. “I don't know what happened. I don't even know how I slept that long or didn't hear them It must be the…” my voice faltered and I realized I had missed my period – two months now.
“Shit.”
They raised an eyebrow at me.
“I'm pregnant,” I groaned.

“This current outbreak underscores the critical need for effective therapeutic agents to treat the Ebola virus. We recognize the heightened urgency of this situation and are carefully evaluating options for use of our investigational drug within accepted clinical and regulatory protocols,” Tekmira CEO and president Mark Murray said in a statement issued on Thursday .
Meanwhile, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, based in Vancouver, Canada, announced Thursday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has amended the trials of Tekmira's drug TKM-Ebola to “partial hold” status — which the company said in a news release enables potential treatment with the drug for those already infected.
The New York Times reported that the U.S. government is forming a group to consider the same issues.
“We are in an unusual situation in this outbreak. We have a disease with a high fatality rate without any proven treatment or vaccine,” Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director-general at the WHO, said in a Thursday statement announcing the meeting. “We need to ask the medical ethicists to give us guidance on what the responsible thing to do is.” The statement did not give a location for the meeting. On Friday the WHO declared the outbreak an international public health emergency. Nigeria declared a state of emergency hours later, the fourth country to do so.
Medical ethicists will meet next week to discuss the use of experimental medicines in the West African Ebola outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the talks in the wake of a controversial decision to treat two infected American aid workers with ZMapp, an Ebola serum never before tested on humans. The move sparked debate over whether using experimental Ebola treatments is ethical — and why Africans have not been offered the same option.
Thousands of people have contracted Ebola since the mid-1970s, but this year's outbreak is the largest on record
On Wednesday three of the United Kingdom's leading Ebola specialists — including the Peter Piot, who discovered the deadly virus in 1976 — called in a joint statement for Africans governments to be “allowed to make informed decisions about whether or not to use these products.”
The most recent Ebola outbreak has killed at least 932 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The WHO said Friday that the potential consequences of a wider contagion from the disease were “particularly serious,” given the virulence of Ebola. The hemorrhagic fever, which is transmitted through bodily fluids, often results in bleeding from the eyes, ears and mouth.
ZMapp was given to the two aid workers from North Carolina–based charity Samaritan's Purse by the private biotechnology company that manufactures the drug. Although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) helped facilitate communication between the company and Samaritan's Purse, the agencies were not involved in approving, transporting or administering the treatment.
The Americans are still alive and appear to be recovering — which is significant, since the mortality rate of the current outbreak is about 60 percent and past Ebola outbreaks has been seen a death rate as high as 90 percent.
On Wednesday, Nigerian Health Minister Onyenbuchi Chukwu said at a news conference that they had asked the CDC about access to the drug. The New York Times reported that Liberia has also expressed interest in ZMapp.
At a Wednesday news conference, President Barack Obama said that standard public health measures would be able to curb the Ebola outbreak and that it was not yet clear whether available Ebola treatments were effective and safe. “We've got to let the science guide us,” they said.
The countries hit by the crisis may not have the health infrastructure to cope with it. Liberia's health system in particular has nearly collapsed since the outbreak began. Health workers have stopped showing up for work out of fear of contracting the disease, and people infected with Ebola have reportedly been turned away from hospitals. Protesters took to the streets of the capital, Monrovia, this week in protest over infected bodies' being left in the streets.
“They should have started quarantining entire areas months ago,” said Robert Garry, who is an expert in viral pathogens at Tulane University and has worked extensively in West Africa. “But it's spread all over, so you're essentially talking about quarantining entire countries if you want to contain it.”
Some experts have pointed out that because of past controversial drug testing by Western companies on Africans, the perception of the U.S. government or private companies first offering experimental drugs to African governments could have been very negative.
“It would have been the front-page screaming headline — ‘Africans used as guinea pigs for American drug company's medicine,'” Salim S. Abdool Karim, director of Caprisa, an AIDS research center in South Africa, said in an interview with The New York Times.
A Texas high school that suspended and then expelled a student for creating a map of their school for the PC shooting game Counter-Strike has released new details of the incident.
The 17-year-old boy's trouble started when the school received a phone call from a parent, one day after the Virginia Tech murders who complained their child had played a computer game that "involved killing" and "took place inside an animated map of Clements high School."
Counter-Strike is a tactical first-person shooter game that pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists.
After the call, officials at the suburban Houston school promptly found the boy's website where the map was being distributed.
The police report said the boy (who was not identified, as they have not been charged with any crime) was brought to the Associate Principal's office where they were frisked and questioned.
The student "stated that it was simply a game and that they never intended for any violence to occur at the school or for anyone to get hurt in any way."
The boy's mother arrived and gave police permission to search their son's bedroom. The police found nothing illegal in the student's bedroom, but confiscated five decorative swords in the search.
Sword ownership rights have been under heavy fire since they were determined to be the leading cause of death during the Siege of Acre in the third crusade.
School officials determined, due to the violent nature of the video game, the iron-age WMD (weapon of mass decapitation) and other undisclosed information, the matter should be classified as a "Level 3" situation.
According to the school manual, "Level 3" covers situations where a student "engages in conduct relating to a false alarm or report or a terrorist threat involving a public school."
The student was immediately transfered from Clements to the M.R. Wood Alternative Education Center, which specializes in special learning needs, and apparently, has a crack terrorism response force.
The police determined that no criminal offense had occurred and there were no threats on any specific person or people. It's quite common for youngsters to craft maps of their schools and other familiar places for these types of games.
The incident has sparked outrage in the county's Chinese community, which the student's family is a part of.
Community news website FortBendNow reports that on Monday, two school trustees attempted to bring the case before the Fort Bend Independent School District Board to expedite an appeal for the student. The trustees requested Board President Steve Smelley (yes, that's their real name) call a special meeting, which they did — but the president and three other board trustees boycotted the meeting — leaving the school's superintendent and one other trustee to face 120 members of the local Chinese community who arrived to show support for the boy's mother.
Because there were not enough board members present, the meeting had to be called off.
The site reports that members of the board boycotted the meeting because they believe the meeting request was an attempt to pander to the Chinese community to gain votes for an upcoming election.
FBISD spokesperson Mary Ann Simpson and Smelley told FortBendNow that there are other mitigating circumstances — which they declined to specify — which came out of the police search.
"They got more stuff that doesn't look too good," Smelley told the website.
The police report did not appear to mention what Smelley was talking about. ®
This is your candidate, Republicans.
After a GOP convention filled with liberal, Socialist ideas, such as cradle-to-grave big government care, the end to the “culture wars,” which means a push back against religious freedoms, now the new face of the Republican party is taking another step left.
Donald Trump said Tuesday night that the federal minimum wage must be raised, and promised to implement a $10 per hour wage if elected president. “I would say $10,” Trump told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly when asked about the specific figure they would recommend. “But with the understanding that somebody like me is going to bring back jobs. I don't want people to be in the $10 dollar category very long. I believe it should be raised.”
Trump is laying down this proposal in response to Democrats, who have said they wanted to lower the minimum wage.
Not to be outdone by their liberal pals, Trump is pretty much blowing up everything conservatives and small government proponents have stood on.
The billionaire business person said they would use the federal wage as a base and encourage states to implement their own minimum wage that is higher than the $10 figure. But they also said some states need higher wages while others do not. “If you take New York, it's very expensive to live in New York,” Trump said.
It's not their first foray into hating heartless Republicans over the minimum wage. We knew about this long before their nomination was official.
Republicans, you had one job …

DeAngelo Hall, before the Redskins played the Eagles for an NFC Easts title. (By Matt Rourke /AP)
How quickly has life changed for these made-over Redskins? Put it this way: just two men on the active roster played even one down under former head coach Jim Zorn. Meanwhile, four players on that 53-man roster arrived in the last month, which means they've never experienced a single loss in Washington. You think Marcel Jensen or Alex Smith care about the swinging gate? They're just trying to figure out what Raljon stands for.
The Redskins have spent this season in a frenzied sprint away from their past, convinced you can't start a new era if you're still hoarding toxic keepsakes from the past, that even a fleeting glance back might turn them into a pillar of stadium pretzel salt. It's as if the entire organization has donned a blond wig and a fake mustache, plus a Starter jacket for good measure.
Twenty-three of the team's 53 active players arrived either in calendar year 2015 or in the first week of 2016. Add in the practice squad, and there are 33 players who have been here less than a year. Forget talk of Shanahan or Gibbs; a majority of the team's locker room hasn't experienced a losing season in Washington. They might as well put put up a banner at FedEx Field, reading “These aren't the Redskins you're looking for.”
Peer through the shiny renovation, though, and you'll find a few men who remember. There's DeAngelo Hall, who arrived midway through Zorn's first season in 2008. And there's 2006 draft pick Kedric Golston, the team's longest-serving player and the only remnant of the Joe Gibbs era.
Has Washington's recurring elevator trip — the Redskins have finished either first or last in each of Hall's eight seasons — given these veterans a different perspective on the latest playoff run? This is perhaps not the moment for deep public reflection; Hall finally told me Wednesday to stop asking questions about their historical perspective. But both players agreed on their primary message to younger teammates: Don't assume the team's window is now jammed open, and don't even think about what lies beyond Sunday afternoon.
“More than anything, just appreciating the moment,” Golston said. “Not to put burdens on them that they didn't have anything to do with, but just to let them appreciate how special it is. Not to take it for granted, but understand that man, this doesn't just happen.”
“Just trying to tell everybody how important it is, how hard it is,” Hall said moments later, recounting their trip to the NFC title game as a rookie in Atlanta. “Losing that game as a rookie, you kind of think, ‘This is kind of easy. We can do this every year.' And to not get back until [2012], and go a couple years and then get back this year, you just never know when an opportunity is going to present itself again. And so we're just harping on everybody giving everything they've got. We'll worry about whatever's next, next. But right now, all we can do is worry about what we've got to, and that's Green Bay.”

Rapid turnover is standard NFL fare, especially on a rebuilding team led by a new GM who has had to patch months' worth of injury-related divots. But it means this rare home playoff game might not have quite the same resonance inside the locker room as it does for the famished fan base. Even 20-something Washingtonians remember Sean Taylor's 2007 death and the ensuing playoff drive, Zorn's maroon and black, the bingo caller, McNabb and Beck, 2012's thrilling bender and the crushing disappointment and dysfunction that followed. Good luck finding a familiar face in Redskins Park able to reminisce.
The past three playoff seasons each felt like the start of a new era of prosperity. In each case, a massive January tremor changed everything: Gibbs hiring a new offensive coordinator in 2006, Gibbs stepping away in 2008, Robert Griffin III's shredded knee in 2013. So you want to ask Golston and Hall whether this time feels different, whether this month will be remembered as a first act more than a discrete flirtation with success.
“I hope so,” Hall said. “I think the guys in this locker room would tend to give you that sign. So I hope so. But we've seen stranger things happen. As long as we stay intact, I think we'll be pretty good to go moving forward.”
“You're asking me to read into a crystal ball,” Golston said. “I mean, when people read into the future, they're just making a guess, you know? Every year's a new year. From an organizational standpoint, there are things that you look for as a successful organization: continuity, the mindset, and having good people. And so from that standpoint, I feel like we have the right pieces put in place — from the front office, coaching staff, players, and everything included in that — to have success. But it's up to us to go out there and continue to grow as an organization.”
Even if they don't ask for tales from 2009, the newcomers recognize how much Golston and Hall have seen. Will Compton calls Washington's longest-serving player “Uncle Ked,” a nickname that is spreading, and said Golston's wisdom has been invaluable.
“Probably the most influential person in this locker room, to me,” the linebacker said. “He's always influencing. He's driven by the right stuff. And they live by it.”
Hall also carries a certain cachet among the dozens of teammates who arrived in recent months, especially because they helped recruit several of them, including DeSean Jackson and Ricky Jean Francois.
“He's DeAngelo Hall,” said Francois, who was lured to Washington during an offseason meeting with the veteran defensive back. “I was a fan of theirs since they were at Virginia Tech, and that was a very long time ago. And just to sit across the table from them and be recruited by them to come to this team, I was like, ‘Yeah, that's the type of guy I want [to play with].' … Everybody loves being around him, everybody wants to hear what he's got to say. That's the type of guy you look to when you walk into a locker room like this.”
Hall's volunteer stint in player acquisition only reinforced their goal to work in a front office when he's retired; they called themselves “the closer” this week.
“I've got a pretty good eye for talent,” they said. “Why shouldn't I pull a John Elway?”
Golston — who, like Hall, is 32 — also has thought about life after football. They already have a Pilates studio in Ashburn, while their wife has their own local real-estate business. They consider Washington their home, and plan to remain here when Golston stops playing.
Have the two veterans thought back to the team's occasional wacky lows during this latest high? Hall said volatility is merely “the nature of the beast, the nature of the business.” And Golston referred to former defensive coaches Gregg Williams and Greg Blache, who “taught me at a young age just to worry about what you can worry about, control what you can control.”
Fair enough, even if those swinging gates continue to swing in my mind. But that Golston remembers playing for Williams and Blache already puts them in a different category. When they and Hall arrive at FedEx Field on Sunday for just the third playoff game in that stadium's history, they will share dozens of memories with the team's longtime supporters, things that would be meaningless to most of their teammates. You can't will away those experiences, even if you're not looking back.
“I play here, but I'm also a fan of the team, so I always wanted to be a part of the solution, not the problem,” Golston said. “And so some of those years were tough. But you've got to like where we're at now.”
Lucky Aya Sakai, a Tokyo-based mom, lives in a house full of cuteness. She's been documenting their son's unlikely friendship with the family dog, a French bulldog named, Muu on Instagram and Facebook.
Sakai, who was a former fashion/advertising exec knows a thing or two about how one picture can evoke a thousand emotions.
“I once handled magazine advertising, so perhaps I picked up a sense for visual expression and how to show photos.”
But giving birth, Sakai gave up their job to care for their son, Tasuku. That's when they started documenting the life of their toddler and the family dog.
And now, the adorable sidekicks have over half a million followers on Instagram!
Whether it's lounging around the couch watching their favorite cartoons…
… exploring the great outdoors
… or serving jail time…
Tasuku is never without Muu!
They love chillin' around doing nothing
… and even solving difficult problems together
Because that's what bros do!
Sometimes Tasuku's lil' bro joins in on the action
Muu stands in as Tasuku's pillow for their afternoon naps
… and even as a foot stool for Tasuku's bro.
.. but that's cool. Such is a dog's life
Aya Sakai's online diary has ballooned to 900+ pictures and counting. Sakai and husband , Takeshi, a publicist for a men's apparel chain, would sometimes be seen in pictures but they mostly play supporting roles. The fiercely private family rarely ever grants interviews but judging by the pics, there is a lot of love (and bowl cuts) in their home!

The Red Bulls and NYCFC renew their local rivalry in a new forum on Wednesday night -- the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Photograph by Matt Kremkau
By ANTHONY J. MERCED
The New York Red Bulls and New York City FC will have a new forum for their rivalry at Red Bull Arena on Wednesday night — the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.
The two Major League Soccer teams have been on different paths recently. NYCFC (7-5-3, 24 points) has only lost twice in its last eight league games while the Red Bulls (6-7-2, 20) have won only once in their last six. That means little in the Open Cup, a knockout tournament where two teams with a short but heated history have never met.
Each team is expected to start strong lineups coming off the league's international break for World Cup qualifying matches and because of the significance of any game between them.
NYCFC has yet to win a game in the Open Cup, losing two years in a row to the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. The Red Bulls have had only moderate success, advancing out of the fourth round only to be eliminated by the Philadelphia Union the last two times.
The Red Bulls have the advantage in head-to-head meetings with NYCFC having won once, at Yankee Stadium last July. At Red Bull Arena, NYCFC has allowed eight goals in three games since the club debuted in 2015.
The Red Bulls hope their recent struggles and search for identity can be offset by the team's impressive home field record. In 2017, they've won five of eight league games played in Harrison, N.J. with a far better goal differential.
This match will not be available on TV, but instead will be streamed on the teams' websites and Facebook Live.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German lawmakers on Friday approved a law the government says will tighten oversight of the BND spy agency, while critics in a country particularly sensitive to violations of privacy insist the reform does exactly the opposite.

The most controversial section of the law is a clause allowing the Bundesnachrichtendienst to intercept communications of foreign entities and individuals on German soil and abroad which pass through a major internet exchange point in Frankfurt.
The government says this is necessary to detect possible militants planning attacks in Germany or Europe.
“How do we want to find terror suspects? How do we want to detect them if not through those means?” asked Clemens Binninger a lawmaker with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party.
The legal changes have alarmed some Germans who attach great importance to privacy amid lingering memories of the Nazi Gestapo and old Communist East Germany's Stasi security police.
The law stipulates that through this activity it cannot be ruled out that the communications of German citizens and entities could also be accidentally intercepted, a major shift for the BND, which had been forbidden from spying on Germans.
The Greens have threatened to petition Germany's highest court and the European Court of Justice to repeal the reform, saying it infringes on Germans' right to privacy.
“Our constitution, basic and human rights laws are not an obstacle to the fight against terrorism,” said Green lawmaker Konstantin von Notz.
Lawmaker Martina Renner of the hard-left Left party said filters used by the BND are not reliable enough to discern messages sent by foreigners from those of Germans.
NO LIMIT
DE-CIX, the Frankfurt-based operator of the world's largest internet exchange point, in September filed a suit at a court in Leipzig against the government, branding the legislation illegal.
Until now, the BND could only monitor up to 20 percent of traffic at one exchange point. The new law removes the cap, giving the agency access to all traffic.
“We want a judicial clarification and legal security for our clients and companies,” said a spokesperson for DE-CIX.
The BND has been in the limelight after scandals that embarrassed Merkel, including revelations that the agency had helped the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) spy on European allies.
The new law bans the BND from spying on countries in the European Union and its citizens, as well as EU institutions, except in the case of suspected terrorist activity.
It also requires the BND to submit requests for cooperation with other spy agencies with a parliamentary committee and bans the agency from carrying out industrial espionage.
It requires the head of the BND, the chancellor's office and an independent panel of judges to approve strategic foreign espionage activities.
Critics also chafe at what they call ambiguous formulations of the conditions under which the BND is required to conduct spying activities.
Under old rules, fighting criminality, war, terrorism and cyberattacks were threats that the agency was mandated to monitor. Now, its mandate includes the “early interception of dangers”.
For some women on the right, Ivanka has been more than a symbol of conservative femininity – they were permission to vote for a monster
Here's our reality: white women's votes helped lead Donald Trump to victory.
'Birth control is a political act': the pre-Trump contraception rush starts now Read more
We can expect, in the days ahead, to see Republicans pointing to these votes as proof that women love Trump, and that the openly misogynist president-elect really does have their best interest at heart. What will make this placation dangerous is that the incoming administration has a ready-made symbol to prop up their lie: Ivanka Trump.
Trump's dutiful daughter brands themselves as a sort of Sheryl Sandberg-lite: they launched a Woman Who Work campaign, was the catalyst behind their father's vague maternity leave proposal, and carefully curates their social media accounts to present themselves as a glamorous but accessible working mom. And now, with a role on Trump's transition team, Ivanka will continue to be presented as a salve for them father's overt sexism and racism.
Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ivanka Trump's video for their Women who Work campaign.
In a moment when the mainstream understanding of feminism is less about politics than it is the nebulous idea of “empowerment”, this diversion could very well work.
In the last 10 years, feminist rhetoric has become popular enough to co-opt – from conservative organizations that claim women “deserve better” than abortion to “you go girl” campaigns that sell cellulite cream.
When I spoke to Ronnee Schreiber, author of Righting Feminism: Conservative Women and American Politics, about the phenomenon in 2014, they told me that for conservative women, using gender as an outreach strategy is “an identity politics angle that they often criticize but often invoke”. In other words, feminism is bad unless someone who doesn't actually believe in feminism is touting it.
Conservative women using gender as a strategy is an identity politics angle that they often criticize but often invoke
This watering down of the movement – not just by conservative women but through commercialization – is what could very well allow Ivanka to create a smokescreen around them father's dangerous views on women.
Indeed, for most of the presidential campaign, Ivanka functioned as a telegenic, articulate shield against accusations of misogyny leveled against Trump. They touted their female-friendly bona fides by talking about all the women they had hired over the years, mentioned the way they supported their career – they even called them a feminist.
Peak marketplace feminism
Andi Zeisler, author of We Were Feminists Once: From Riot Grrrl to CoverGirl, the Buying and Selling of a Political Movement and co-founder of Bitch magazine, says Ivanka is “peak marketplace feminism”.
“She's among the many people who have opportunistically grasped at the label as a means of trying to appear relevant to women,” they say.
Even when the New York Times ran a story about Trump's sketchy history with women, Ivanka insisted their father was “not a groper”. That statement would come back to haunt Ivanka after a video of their father bragging about sexual assault was released, followed by more than a dozen women coming forward to accuse Trump of groping them.
Still, Ivanka continued to have their back. They released a statement calling their comments “inappropriate and offensive”, but said they were glad they apologized. In a later interview, they dismissed the tape as “crude language” and claimed their words didn't match up with the man they knew.
But as their father's campaign seemed to unravel and Ivanka's own brand took hits – there was a widespread boycott of their clothing line – having a stylish working mother as a surrogate served Donald Trump well.
At the Republican convention, Ivanka's speech – in which they described their father as a champion of women – was widely lauded, despite the obvious ironies. “You felt like they were introducing Betty Friedan or Gloria Steinem, not Donald Trump,” says Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.
Ivanka's continued support, combined with their Teflon-like public image, convinced many women that Trump must be a good person despite all evidence to the contrary. Anne Helen Peterson at Buzzfeed dubbed them the “Ivanka voters”: “‘If Trump produced someone that classy, that's a testament to something,” one woman told me. Ivanka, then, as Trump launderer: a sanitized, assuring, classy Trump who makes it less troublesome to vote for their father.”
For some women on the right, Ivanka was more than a symbol of conservative femininity – they were permission to vote for a monster: the face of a distorted “feminism” that helped to usher in 53% of white women's votes.
“Maybe [the thinking is] if they can respect them and think he's a good guy, they can't be that bad,” Walsh says. Still, Walsh tells me, we confused some Republican women's dislike of Trump with the idea that their distaste would change their vote. “Research has always shown us that people vote their party,” they say.
That anything having to do with women can now be positioned as “empowered” will only help Ivanka keep up their feminist facade – not just among voters, but in a mainstream culture and elite class eager to embrace women's rights so long as they're depoliticized.
It wasn't that long ago, after all, that the TEDWomen conference (with its $1,000 ticket price) told me it wouldn't feature any talks on abortion because it was a “topical issue we wouldn't take a position on”. Various women's conferences have come under fire for not allowing women to bring their breastfeeding infants, and the panoply of women's rights gatherings that have come out of the corporate world – from Thrive and Women in the World to MAKERS and They Summit – skew more toward feelgood talks about asking for more money in job negotiations or stopping yourself from saying “sorry” than they do toward changing politics and systems.
How long until Ivanka is headlining one of these conferences? If Trump's first-born daughter is able to come out of this election with their reputation and brand unscathed, invited to women's events under the guise of “diversity of thought”, the future of feminism is at risk.

What comes next for Ivanka, and by proxy their father's message to women, is very likely to be a continuation of what we've already seen happen to feminism – the polite (and incorrect) belief that women's rights are a bipartisan affair: that so long as it has the sheen and language of women's empowerment, it's good for women.
During our interview, Schreiber, the expert on conservative women, explained how the conservative skewing of feminism was based on the notion that if women behaved properly, we would be fine.
“The idea is that men will treat women better if we present ourselves respectfully,” they said.
It's a sentiment we're already seeing directed at the left: calls for reconciliation and acceptance even as white nationalism and hate crimes sweep the nation. But feminists know – especially as Ivanka is propped up as the “respectable” and docile conservative ideal of white womanhood – that there is little more dangerous to their rights than acting respectably.
Numerous Shutting Down on May 1
Charlie Wood
02 February 2016
Today I have some bad news. Despite our best efforts, we've been unable to find a source of funding that will allow us to continue to operate Numerous. The service will be shutting down on May 1.
Colin, John, and I want to express our sincere appreciation for the support our more than 150,000 registered users and our valued partners have shown us. We believe we've created something with the potential to be profoundly important. We've been featured multiple times by Apple and have built a loyal following. That said, we have ultimately failed to put together the right combination of product, market, and message.
We're of course extremely disappointed, but are at the same time proud of what we've built and what has been built on top of it. We know that thousands of users around the world—including the three of us!—will miss having Numerous available. Ultimately though we were unable to build a large enough user base to become self-sustaining.
Over the coming weeks we'll be posting some additional thoughts about what we and our platform partners have built. In the meantime, let me just say thank you.
If you have any questions, please let us know.
Best regards, Charlie

Facebook's Arbitrary Offensiveness Police Take Down Informational Video About Breast Cancer Screening
from the bunch-of-boobs dept
Stories of Facebook's attempt at puritanical patrols of its site are legion at this point. The site has demonstrated it cannot filter out parody, artwork, simple speech in the form of outrage, iconic historical photos, or sculpture from its prude-patrol censorship. As a private company, Facebook is of course allowed to follow its own whim when it comes to what is allowed on its site, but as an important tool in this era for communication and speech, the company is also a legitimate target for derision when it FUBARs this as badly as it does so often.
So queue up the face-palming once more, as Facebook has decided to remove a video posted by a Swedish cancer charity informing women how to check for breast cancer, because the video included animated breasts, and breasts are icky icky.
Facebook has removed a video on breast cancer awareness posted in Sweden after deeming the images offensive, the Swedish Cancer Society said on Thursday. The video, displaying animated figures of women with circle-shaped breasts, was aimed at explaining to women how to check for suspicious lumps. Sweden's Cancerfonden said it had tried in vain to contact Facebook, and had decided to appeal against the decision to remove the video.
Based on images on Cancerfonden's site, the tantalizing breasts in question were of the variety of stick figures. Not exactly tantalizing in its imagery, the video content was instead supposed to educate women on the proper method for detecting lumps that could be cancerous. Save for perhaps some minor percentage of humankind, these are the types of images that don't conjure a sexual connotation. And yet Facebook took them down.
To the social media giant's credit, it eventually put the video back up on its site and apologized.
In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for Facebook said the images of the Swedish campaign had now been approved. "We're very sorry, our team processes millions of advertising images each week, and in some instances we incorrectly prohibit ads," they said. "This image does not violate our ad policies. We apologise for the error and have let the advertiser know we are approving their ads."
Which, you know, fine, but exactly how many of these types of stories must be endured before Facebook acknowledges that there is a problem with its filtering and censorship process? I don't think the exclusion of oversight is the answer, but I would hope that we could agree that if the takedown filters continue to catch bronze statues and breast cancer videos in its net, perhaps some recalibration is needed.

The websites of the international credit card MasterCard and the Swedish prosecution authority are among the latest to be taken offline in the escalating technological battle over WikiLeaks, web censorship and perceived political pressure.
Co-ordinated attacks by online activists who support the site and its founder Julian Assange – who is in UK custody accused of raping two Swedish women – have seen the websites of the alleged victims' Swedish lawyer disabled, while commercial and political targets have also been subject to attack by a loose coalition of global hackers.
The Swedish prosecution authority has confirmed its website was attacked last night and this morning. MasterCard was partially paralysed today in revenge for the payment network's decision to cease taking donations to WikiLeaks.
In an attack referred to as Operation Payback, a group of online activists calling themselves Anonymous appear to have orchestrated a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack on the financial site, bringing its service to a halt.
Attempts to access www.mastercard.com have been unsuccessful since shortly after 9.30am.
The site would say only that it was "experiencing heavy traffic on its external corporate website" but insisted this would not interfere with its ability to process transactions.
But one payment service company told the BBC its customers were experiencing "a complete loss of service" on MasterCard SecureCode. The credit card company later confirmed that loss.
MasterCard tonight said in a statement it was "working to restore normal service levels" after "a concentrated effort to flood our corporate web site with traffic and slow access." The company added: "It is important to note that our systems have not been compromised and there is no impact on our cardholders' ability to use their cards for secure transactions globally."
MasterCard announced on Monday that it would no longer process donations to WikiLeaks, which it claimed was engaged in illegal activity.
Visa, Amazon, Swiss bank PostFinance and others have also announced in recent days that they will cease trading with the whistleblowing site.
The moves have led to concerted attempts by hackers to target companies they deem guilty of "censoring" WikiLeaks.
Operation Payback, which has been targeting commercial sites that have cut their ties with WikiLeaks for some days, has also made threats to other organisations including Twitter, which it says is suppressing the site.
"We will fire at anything or anyone that tries to censor WikiLeaks, including multibillion-dollar companies such as PayPal," a statement circulating online, apparently from Operation Payback, said.
"Twitter, you're next for censoring #WikiLeaks discussion. The major shitstorm has begun," it added.
Twitter has issued a statement denying it has censored the hashtag, and saying confusion had arisen over its "trending" facility.
Meanwhile it has also emerged that Visa has today ordered DataCell, an IT firm that helps WikiLeaks collect payments, to suspend all of its transactions – even those involving other payees – a day after it cut off all the firm's donations being made to WikiLeaks.
DataCell, a small Icelandic company that facilitates transfers made by credit cards including Visa and MasterCard, says it will take up "immediate legal actions" and warned that the powerful "duopoly" of Visa and MasterCard could spell "the end of the credit card business worldwide".
Andreas Fink, chief executive of DataCell, said in a statement: "Putting all payments on hold for seven days or more is one thing but rejecting all further attempts to donate is making the donations impossible.
"This does clearly create massive financial losses to WikiLeaks, which seems to be the only purpose of this suspension.
"This is not about the brand of Visa; this is about politics, and Visa should not be involved in this.
"Visa customers are contacting us in masses to confirm that they really donate and they are not happy about Visa rejecting them. It is obvious that Visa is under political pressure to close us down."
Earlier, PayPal, which has also been the subject of technological attack since it suspended payments to WikiLeaks last week, appeared to admit that it had taken the step after an intervention from the US state department.
PayPal's vice-president of platform, Osama Bedier, told an internet conference the site had decided to freeze WikiLeaks' account on 4 December after government representatives said it was engaged in illegal activity. "On November 27th, the state department, the US government basically, wrote a letter saying that the WikiLeaks' activities were deemed illegal in the United States and as a result our policy group had to make the decision of suspending the account," Bedier said. They added: "We ... comply with regulations around the world, making sure that we protect our brand."
Their remarks will undoubtedly intensify criticism from supporters of WikiLeaks that the site is being targeted for political reasons.
Operation Payback, which refers to itself as "an anonymous, decentralised movement that fights against censorship and copywrong", and has been linked to the influential internet messageboard 4Chan, argues that such steps "are long strides closer to a world where we cannot say what we think and are unable to express our opinions and ideas".
It added: "We cannot let this happen. This is why our intention is to find out who is responsible for this failed attempt at censorship.
"This is why we intend to utilise our resources to raise awareness, attack those against and support those who are helping lead our world to freedom and democracy."
The MasterCard action was confirmed on Twitter at 9.39am by user @Anon_Operation, who later tweeted: "We are glad to tell you that http://www.mastercard.com/ is down and it's confirmed! #ddos #WikiLeaks Operation: Payback (is a bitch!) #PAYBACK"
PostFinance was successfully hacked on Monday after it shut down one of WikiLeaks' key bank accounts, accusing Assange of lying. Its service since has been seriously disrupted.
PayPal has also been targeted a number of times, but while its internal blog was paralysed for more than two hours, the payment processing facility has so far been able to withstand the attacks.
Other cyberattacks were mounted yesterday on EveryDNS.net, which suspended dealings on 3 December, while Amazon, which removed WikiLeaks content from its EC2 cloud on 1 December, may also be a possible target.
According to bloggers monitoring the cyberattacks, those involved in the protests have also been targeting the websites of US senator Joe Lieberman, who is an outspoken critic of WikiLeaks, and Sarah Palin, who said Assange should be treated like a terrorist.
Claes Bergstrom, the lawyer of the two women who claim Assange raped or assaulted them, confirmed their website was shut down overnight, as was the site of a lawyer representing Assange in Sweden. This was the first time such an attack had occurred, they said.
DDoS attacks, which often involve flooding the target site with requests so that it cannot cope with legitimate communication, are illegal.
Toronto FC has built up its reputation as one of the best cities in Major League Soccer. The fans have come out in droves even during Canada's harsh weather and even when the team has been disappointing. Disappointing is a mild word to describe the play of TFC over the years. The city is ripe for the taking and it's up to Danny Koevermans to become the city's first real soccer superstar.
In a 2012 season shortened by injury, Koevermans only bulged the back of the net nine times. It took them six games to get their first and it just didn't seem that they scored the big goals when needed. That was left to another striker, Jamaican international Ryan Johnson. Johnson is now a member of the Portland Timbers. Eric Hassli was brought in at the end of last season as another striker but they requested a trade before the preseason and was traded to FC Dallas. That leaves Koevermans to score the goals and really make a mark with TFC.
Koevermans is a designated player making over a million a year, making them the second highest paid player on the squad behind Torsten Frings. The former German international's career is slowly and begrudgingly coming to an end so Koevermans has all the weight on their shoulders to turn the team around.
The city has been looking for someone to become their superstar. Danny Dichio is really the only player to make a dent in becoming a star.  They are always remembered by a song in the 24th minute of every match as it was they who scored the franchise's first goal. That really was all they did so they are a star in name only. Dwayne De Rosario was brought in with the reputation as being the best and most exciting player in the MLS. All they will be remembered for was theirs pay me the money gesture after scoring one of their few goals. They requested a trade and left soon after. Julian De Guzman, another Canadian international, was signed with the idea of becoming the best midfielder in the league. They were another dud and was traded away.
The list of disastrous internationals signed can go on and on with Laurent Robert, Carlos Ruiz, Armando Guevara, Carl Robinson and much maligned Spanish international Mista to name a few. They have all been failures in leading the team to more wins or becoming household names in the eyes of soccer fans in Toronto.
So what does Toronto and TFC want? They want someone to score goals of quality and lots of them. They want someone to help garner wins and even make the playoffs. They want someone to be out in the community and good with the media. What they want is their first real superstar. It is wide open for Koevermans to become that player.
Many believe that European players come over to Toronto for their last pay day before retirement. Dichio did that and now Frings is doing the same. Koevermans should be able to see what they can become if they just fulfills what the management and new president and general manager Kevin Payne see in him. They can have the keys to the city.
Toronto is a soccer mad city and they are looking for a winner. Koevermans has one chance and that's this season to do that and if they do they might actually build a statue of them outside BMO Field.

Swiss bank opens four safety deposit boxes containing manuscripts by the author of The Trial for expert inspection
Franz Kafka wanted all their manuscripts to be burned after their death, but their friend Max Brod disregarded the request, seeding a complex legal battle over thousands of manuscripts that has the literary world agog. That legal tussle takes a new twist today as four safety deposit boxes in a Zurich bank containing the manuscripts are opened.
The boxes are believed to contain thousands of manuscripts by Kafka and Brod, including letters, journals, sketches and drawings, some of which have never been published and could provide literary detetectives an insight into one of the 20th century's greatest writers.
The move in Zurich follows similar action at two Tel Aviv banks, which were ordered by an Israeli tribunal to extract Kafka's works from their vaults.
The documents form the heart of a dispute over ownership between the state of Israel and the Hoffe sisters who say they inherited Kafka's estate from their mother Esther Hoffe – Brod's secretary. Brod not only ignored Kafka's wishes but published their work and bequeathed the originals to Esther Hoffe.
Israel, however, claims that Kafka's documents are the property of the state as Brod migrated to Israel in 1939.
Esther's daughter, Eve Hoffe of Tel Aviv, is expected to be present at the opening of the boxes, along with a delegation of lawyers appointed by the court. Assisted by German literary experts and a manuscript expert, they will convey to the court a precise record of what the boxes contain. The attorneys will be assisted by German literary experts and a manuscript expert.
The judge will then decide whether to return the documents to the safety deposit boxes or transfer them to a public archive, to be published for the benefit of future generations.
Meanwhile, the Israeli court is expected to rule on Hoffe's petition calling for a gag order on the contents of the box. The Israeli paper, Haaretz, has asked the court to allow the documents to be published, citing their public and literary value.
Kafka died from tuberculosis in 1924, leaving a set of instructions to Brod: "Dearest Max, My last request: Everything I leave behind me [is] to be burned unread." But Brod instead published for the first time Kafka's novels The Trial, The Castle and Amerika.
In 1939 Brod fled their home in Prague as the Nazis approached and took a single suitcase of Kafka papers to Tel Aviv, where they started a new life. They later donated manuscripts of The Castle and Amerika to Oxford University, but kept the original of The Trial for himself.
After the death of their wife, Brod began a relationship with their assistant, Esther Hoffe. When they died in 1968, they left a will that is now disputed. They sold documents over several years and when they died in 2007 ago they left the remaining papers to their daughters Eva and Ruti.

Health minister Sussan Ley says changes to law give patients and doctors access to a safe, reliable and legal source of cannabis for medicinal use
Budding cannabis producers can now apply for a licence to legally grow the crop in Australia, for medicinal use only.
The Narcotic Drugs Amendment Act 2016, which came into effect on Sunday, allows businesses to apply for a licence to cultivate cannabis or manufacture cannabis products for medicinal purposes, or to conduct related research.
The health minister, Sussan Ley, said the changes would give patients and doctors access to a safe, reliable and legal source of cannabis for medicinal use.
We must legalise access to medical cannabis as a matter of urgency | Mike Barnes Read more
“Until now, it has been difficult for patients to access medicinal cannabis products from overseas sources,” Ley said in a statement on Sunday.
“These new laws change that situation by providing for a domestic supply of medicinal cannabis products that are not readily available for import.”
They stressed the changes do not decriminalise recreational cannabis use.
Licence applicants must pass a security test and meet strict requirements, and individual states and territories will still decide who can use medicinal cannabis.
HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh may be in the midst of a major financial crisis, but this has not stopped chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu from spending a steep Rs 100 crore of the public exchequer money on himself. This includes refurbishing various offices and hiring aircraft and helicopters for their national and international travels.Till date, Naidu has constructed four offices for the chief minister and camp offices in Hyderabad and Vijayawada. Presently coming up at a cost of Rs 21.3 crore is the new camp office in Vijayawada. While Rs 6.3 crore has been released for converting the irrigation circle office as the camp office, Rs 15 crore is being spent for the security set-up. Separate GOs have been issued for these expenditures.Earlier, Naidu spent Rs 45 crore of public money on refurbishing the Lake View Guest House as well as two blocks in the AP Secretariat in Hyderabad. Immediately after their victory in the 2014 general elections, they ordered renovation of South H block as their new office and the state government spent more than Rs 15 crore on sprucing up the building. However, citing bad vaastu, Naidu later opted for an office in L block. Complete renovation of the 7th and 8th floors of the building was ordered, which took three months and cost about Rs 20 crore. Apart from that, at an additional cost of Rs 5 crore, new lifts were installed, new entrances were put in place and elaborate security arrangements made.To give a facelift to the Lake View Guest House on the Raj Bhavan Road, the state government spent about Rs 7 crore. However, the building is now used being used only once a week by Naidu. As part of the renovation, age old boulders on the guest house premises were removed and all rooms refurbished to ensure that chief minister has the finest camp office.But the expenditure does not stop there. Naidu has moved into a new rented accommodation in Jubilee Hills and there is a proposal for another camp office there at their temporary residence for which the state wants to pay Rs two lakh a month as rent. This does not include the residential quarters as that is treated under a separate head.Interestingly, Naidu's extravagance did not stop with changing offices, but extended to hiring chartered planes and choppers. Ever since they took over as chief minister, they have made sure that majority of their tours, domestic and foreign, are managed by private chartered companies. The Navayuga group that operates two ports across the east coast is one regular supplier of chartered planes to the AP CM. Airone is another private company that has extended its services to Naidu's frequent tours that included a chartered flight to Singapore along with some corporates.“The government has paid Rs 15 crore (GO No. 30) to these private flight operators up to February. Another Rs 7 crore has to be paid for the month of February and March. The bill for the month of April has not yet been received,” said sources in the government.The CM visited Singapore twice as well as Japan, China and Davos once during the last ten months and is all set to visit the USA soon. Further, in the name of equal justice to all districts, Naidu came out with an innovative concept of holding programmes in different districts including the collectors' conference in Vijayawada, Independence Day celebrations in Kurnool and investors' meet in Visakhapatnam. However, according to officials, this has increased the state expenditure as hundreds of officers are forced to travel and stay in hotels in these places to attend Naidu's meetings. “Instead of going about their work by displaying austerity, the AP CM is doing the exact opposite and bleeding the state's coffers,” lamented a senior official who did not want to be named.

In this excerpt from our 2015 National Conference, Kevin DeYoung reminds us that we are to love the people of this fallen world while rejecting the system of this fallen world.
Transcript
The people in this fallen world are to be loved. The system of this fallen world is to be categorically rejected. If you cannot understand both of those things at the same time you and I will not become mature Christians.
You will have people over here who are very fine at saying we must love the world. “God so loved the world…” and so they want to redeem culture, and they want to transform the world, and they have all sorts of things that we need to go see this movie, and we need to have the finest, stuff and the best stuff because the world. They forget about the verses that talk about the world under the sway of the evil one—a place filled with temptations and dangers.
But if on the flipside we only understand the world as a place in control of the evil one, then you're bound to be a very cantankerous sort of person. “Look the world is evil and that's why I don't love anything or anyone in the world including you. Just trying to be biblical.” Okay. Those are not the people you want serving on the elder board of your church. But if you're not discerning they go to a verse: “The world is under the control of the evil one.” Well it is. We're going to talk about that, but the world as the fallen system is to be rejected even as the Father has a love for Their lost people in this world and so seeks them out that while they were still a long way off, Jesus said in Luke 15 the Father ran to this prodigal who was returning home.
PM insists: 'I'm confident we can answer all questions that are being asked'
But it's the first time they have appeared to acknowledge some expenses may not have been declared in
David Cameron (pictured on ITV's Peston on Sunday show today) indicated that Tory chairperson Lord Feldman may have inadvertently ‘mis-declared' or ‘left out' vital General Election expenses
Tory chairperson Lord Feldman may have inadvertently ‘mis-declared' or ‘left out' vital General Election expenses, David Cameron indicated today – as they insisted the party would co-operate with a growing fraud inquiry.
Ten police forces and the Electoral Commission are now investigating claims that the Conservative Party spent thousands of pounds more than the law allows in marginal seats across the country during last year's election.
The Prime Minister insisted today that the party had not ‘done anything wrong'.
But they appeared to acknowledge that some expenses may not have been declared in compliance with the letter of the law.
Asked if Lord Feldman would have to resign, Mr Cameron told ITV's Peston on Sunday programme: ‘Well, I don't believe we have done anything wrong. If there were mis-declarations or things left out we have to put those in place, but I'm confident we can answer all the questions that are being put to us.'
An investigation by Channel Four News and the Daily Mail has revealed concerns about whether the accommodation costs of activists bussed around the country by the Tories to campaign in key constituencies were recorded properly.
In many cases, expenses appear to have been recorded as national expenses, or not recorded at all, rather than added to the costs in the constituencies where the campaigning took place.
Deliberate breach of spending limits by individual candidates – usually around £15,000 – is a criminal offence punishable by a fine or even a one-year jail term.
Any MP found guilty would be barred automatically from holding public office for three years, triggering a new election. In theory, the Conservatives could lose their 12-seat majority if cases are proved.
Mr Cameron yesterday said it was normal practice to record so-called ‘battlebus' expenses as national campaign spending, rather than adding it to the total in the seats where the campaigning took place.
They said: ‘In the end, I'm responsible for everything but I'm very confident that the Conservative Party is gripping this with the chairperson Andrew Feldman.
‘You know, lots of political parties have these bus tours, you know buses that go around different constituencies and that is a national expense. But this is all now in conversation with the Electoral Commission and these are their investigations so we should let that take its place.
‘But I'm confident that the idea of a bus that is a national bus that visits constituencies, I think the Labour Party's done that, the Liberals have done it, we've done it.'
Asked whether Tory chairperson Lord Feldman (pictured left) should resign, David Cameron (pictured right) told ITV's Peston on Sunday programme: ‘Well, I don't believe we have done anything wrong. If there were mis-declarations or things left out we have to put those in place, but I'm confident we can answer all the questions that are being put to us'
Ten police forces and the Electoral Commission are now investigating claims that the Conservative Party spent thousands of pounds more than the law allows in marginal seats across the country during last year's election
SNP MP Pete Wishart wrote to the Metropolitan Police tonight to call for a wider investigation into whether the Conservatives attempted to subvert the Representation of the People Act.
They wrote: ‘Currently there are some 10 police forces investigating the electoral expenditure of some 28 Conservative candidates who contested the 2015 General Election.
‘Where the ongoing cases will take their legal course, the Conservative Party as a whole must be properly investigated to ascertain if there was any systematic attempt to circumvent electoral legislation defining candidate and national expenditure.'
The Electoral Commission has accused the Conservatives of dragging its feet over the issue. Earlier this month it took the unprecedented step of taking High Court action to force the release of campaign spending details by the party.
The Tories deny wrongdoing and blame an ‘administrative error' for failing to register some accommodation costs. They also blamed an ‘administrative error' for failure to declare costs related to its battlebus campaign in marginal seats in the South West, the Midlands the North.
The ‘Road Trip' battlebus campaign was the brainchild of Mark Clarke, the so-called ‘Tatler Tory' later accused of bullying Elliott Johnson, a 21-year-old activist who committed suicide. Mr Clarke, who was once tipped as a future minister by society magazine Tatler, denies the allegations.

An interview with showrunner Nick Antosca on what makes the mini-series work and more.
There's no question that some of horror's scariest and most memorable moments have come from our imagination being encouraged to run wild. Would we really have gotten the same thrill of terror if we had peered into that black bassinet and seen Adrian's eyes along with Rosemary? Probably not. Fear in its most distilled and potent form often comes when we are alone in the dark, our minds free to wander the archives of horrors seen or half-remembered, until we eventually suffocate ourselves into the respite of sleep.
It is on this nightmarish foundation that writer, executive producer and showrunner Nick Antosca decided to lay the groundwork for SyFy's Channel Zero: Candle Cove. The show is based on a creepypasta, an update on an urban legend, about a sinister children's show. This “Candle Cove,” written by Kris Straub, unfolds over the course of recurring postings to a chatroom, where users recall a strange puppet show from their childhood. The memories become darker and more terrifying until it is finally revealed that they were watching not watching anything but TV static.
While this makes for a great read, it also poses a unique challenge when adapting the story for television. How do you expand internet postings into a compelling storyline for television? It's a challenge that wasn't lost on Antosca, but one that they also are able to work to their advantage.
“The challenges are also what's so appealing,” Antosca said. “It gave us a lot of room to invent. We wanted to honor the spirit and mood of Kris's story. When you're expanding a four page story to six episodes, you have to create more mythology and foundation, and that's really risky for a story that depends so much on suggestion.
“A huge part of Kris's story is the lack of explanation. So the challenge was to preserve that feeling of suggested menace while building out the world. The pleasure of adaptation in this case came from allowing ourselves to be inspired by Kris's story.”
That inspiration led Antosca to tell the story of Mike Painter, a child psychologist who comes home to Iron Hills, Ohio to try and uncover the secrets behind the death of their twin brother, Eddie. Buried in their childhood, was Candle Cove, a strange puppet show about pirates that had a Svengali-spell over Eddie and drove them to murder several local children. Now as an adult, Mike has discovered that Candle Cove is back and it is once again infiltrating the children in their hometown, often with deadly consequences.
Already four episodes in, Channel Zero: Candle Cove has proven it will pull no punches. The beginning of the second episode opened with Katie, the daughter of Mike's childhood sweetheart Jessica, nearly disemboweling their own brother with a pirate hook left for them by the characters on Candle Cove. The latest episode also ended with the unexpected death of a major character, made even more unsettling as it came at the hands of children. Is anyone safe on Candle Cove? Perhaps not. Antosca confirmed that at least one more major character will die by the end of the series.
Without a doubt, one of the creepiest new additions to the Candle Cove story has been The Tooth Child, a skittering creature made entirely of baby teeth that subsists solely on dentition. More than once during the show, children have pulled out their own teeth and offered them up as passage to visit Candle Cove. While Antosca's Tooth Child was born out of the most innocuous circumstance, where it almost wound up might surprise you.
“[The Tooth Child] comes from thinking about childhood. My mom kept my baby teeth in a little box and I sometimes as a kid I would go look at them. The Tooth Child is something I had a nightmare about while I was outlining the season. At the time I had just started writing on Hannibal and it seemed unlikely that Channel Zero would ever get on the air, so the Tooth Child came very close to appearing in Hannibal Season Three in a different form.”
But beyond this, don't expect a detailed explanation on the creature. While Antosca confirmed that series will identify The Tooth Child, it will rely more on elaboration then an explanation of what it really is or how it became that way. “Nightmares in their purest form work on a gut level. There's no recipe or list of ingredients.”
Going forward, Channel Zero's second season will pick up with another creepypasta, this time “No-End House,” written by Brian Russell. The series follows a young woman (Amy Forsyth) who visits an inescapable house of horrors and finds each room more disturbing than the next. It will also feature John Carroll Lynch, who has turned out several memorable horror roles, including Zodiac, The Invitation and two stints on American Horror Story, which include the terrifying Twisty the Clown (Freak Show) and the infamous serial killer (and clown enthusiast) John Wayne Gacy (Hotel).
Antosca divulged a little bit of what viewers can expect from this new season, which may excite Tarkovsky enthusiasts. “In some ways, our version of No-End House is like a horror version of Solaris. The style will be very different from Candle Cove, but as in the first season, there will be a lot of nightmarish symbolism and dream imagery.”
Like the first season, Channel Zero: No-End House will also be a six-episode run. But while the anthology series will be moving onto a new story, the two seasons will still be linked according to Antosca. “The first two seasons are companion pieces, thematically ‐ they are both psychological horror stories about people dealing with intense loss.”
Filming has already begun on No-End House, which is slated to premiere on Syfy next year. In the meantime, the fifth episode of Channel Zero: Candle Cove airs this Tuesday at 9pm EST on SyFy.
Julianna Pena's injury story, however actual or fictionalized, caught my attention. I had never considered it fully, but their situation sparked a thought I've been unable to shake: women face a training environment that is essentially impossible to replicate for men.
Men face no gender where they are at near constant disadvantage when it comes to physical prowess. Whatever challenges they may face in the course of their career, it is highly unlikely men will ever succumb to the contours of gender discrimination at any gym. And while female fighters glean some benefit from training with men, the inverse isn't necessarily true, at least not to the same degree. Women also must deal with a gender in predominant number that, as Pena's situation underscores, offer the significant potential for injury both small and catastrophic.
The race to Ronda Rousey Who will fight Ronda Rousey next? It's a three-woman race featuring Holly Holm, Gina Carano and Cristiane "Cyborg" Justino.
In short, I wonder what it's all like. Are men a 'tax' women fighters have to pay in order to succeed? Do they need them at all? Certainly there's some benefit and absolute necessity to training with men, but is it just stronger and faster training partners? Is the only downside merely injury or is there more to the story?
When it comes to being a professional female mixed martial arts fighter, what is the truth about the ups, downs and unknowns when it comes to training with men?
To help with perspective, I consulted a few experts - Invicta matchmaker, UFC and Strikeforce veteran Julie Kedzie; UFC and former Strikeforce bantamweight champion Sarah Kaufman; Invicta atomweight champion Michelle Waterson; and former Invicta atomweight champion Jessica Penne - on the risks, rewards and bizarre circumstances women encounter when it comes to training with men.
Is training with men a requirement to be a world-class competitor?
Kedzie: "That's a weird question because I don't think you can be world-class fighter without training with good training partners. Whether they're male or female, I think you just have to have the right training partners. If you have a whole bunch of men, but they suck, then no, you're not going to be a world class fighter. If you have a whole bunch of women and they suck, you're not going to be a world-class fighter. If you have a whole bunch of men that are really good, then you'll probably rise to the occasion, likewise with women."
Waterson: "When we fight, we fight against women and women fight differently than men. I feel like women are a little bit more aggressive, a little bit more out of control, a little bit more emotional when it comes to fighting. If you're always training with men, you don't get those aspects of the fight game. Also, when you do train with women, it's competition. The person across from you that you're training with, even though they're your training partner, deep in their head they're to prove something to you and to themselves."
What is the best aspect of training with men?
Penne: "I feel like their intensity is really beneficial. Also, they're stronger, faster than females, so you get used to that kind of speed going to females sometimes, it's a little bit more beneficial.
You also get used to carrying a lot more weight than somebody your own size. You have to carry heavier loads and when you're fighting a female your own size, it feels a lot easier."
Waterson: "I think it goes back to what kind of men you're training with. I feel like the smaller guys are good because they give you the speed. A lot of the guys I train with, they don't go hard because they don't want to try to hurt you, but they give you the speed and the pressure that is needed to get better.
"When I started fighting, I was training with a lot of males. I kind of became a counter fighter. I learned how to counter off of other people's movements. You have to learn how to be a lot more technical when you're training someone that's overpowering you."
Kedzie: "Their durability. You can hit a man pretty hard. They may say 'ow', but they probably won't and that might be their ego. You can get a sense of how hard you can hit.
"It's nice to go with someone that's stronger than you. Many women are stronger than me as well, but it's nice to go with someone that's always stronger than me so that I can get a sense of how hard to go in an actual fight."
What is the worst aspect of training with men?
Kedzie: "They always try to correct you. Especially if you're the lone women in the room, everybody just finds some reason to correct you, some reason to try and teach you more when sometimes you're just there for your workout. That drives me bananas. I have a lot of confidence in my own abilities. 'Oh, that's wrong! That's wrong' tends to get my hackles up even more.
'Oh, she's a girl. Let's show them what to do.' I hate that."
Penne: "There's more potential for injury. My training partners that I have at Reign MMA are extremely trustworthy. I trust them. I've known them for years. I've trained with them for years. I trust them that they won't retaliate because that's been an issue in the past at other gyms I've been to. Guys have some ego problems and it has led to me getting injured and no longer training with those people."
Waterson: "Sometimes if a male has an ego because for a male, it's a lose-lose for them. If they go too easy on you and you whip their ass, then they got beat by a girl. If they beat you up, they're being an asshole because you beat up a girl.
I really do think it's on the person. That's just my thought for never ever comparing males to females when I'm training. When I'm going to the gym, everybody is my training partners. I don't view them male-female. I have a lot of male training partners I enjoy rolling with more than females just because they give me better work. I think whether it's male or female, they're certain people you click with and you're able to mesh well with and train better with."
The MMA Hour The latest episode features interviews with Tim Kennedy, Holly Holm, Lenny Fresquez, John Hackleman, and more.
Have you personally experienced any training accidents from training with men?
Kedzie: "The only times I've been knocked out in training has been by men, not women. I would take the blame on myself for that because it wasn't that they were going too hard for me. It was mostly they were going light and I was going to be hard.
It's not that they would actually have too much pressure on me, but that I would slam into them."
Penne: "I've gotten my ribs popped by guys. Accidents happen when guys are so much bigger and sometimes egos get involved. They can go a little bit too hard.
It may not be a big deal to women at competing at 25, 35, 45, but I'm a 105-er. I'm the smallest person in there. It's not an even playing field.
Although, what's funny is my coach Mark [Munoz], who fights at 185, will come in and he'll move around with me. I've never been injured training with him. He's a professional, great athlete and knows how to move their body. They know how to not hurt me."
Everyone knows men can be faster or stronger. Mechanically, are there any other differences?
Kaufman: "You definitely benefit from working with people who inherently, even if they're the same size as you, are going to have more strength. Not necessarily better endurance, but their lung capacity has the potential to be better. Their balance is different, not necessarily better or worse.
But things are different. They have different body structures and different muscle capacities, so being able to be pushed, it can be a benefit, but you can also sometimes get frustrated because I'm trying to do things in training that in fights have worked for me, but with people who are stronger, faster, more explosive in that regard. You can get frustrated in training because you can be like, 'Oh, I'm getting in. I have my hands closed, it's a super deep shot and somehow, they muscle out of it.' And my coach has to sit there and say, 'You know that they're 20 pounds heavier and they're a dude, right?
You have to think about that, but you don't want to think about that."
Penne: "If we're working clinch takedowns, a man's upper body is a lot broader than a woman's so you get used to having a certain grip, gripping a certain way and when you go with a female, they're a lot smaller, so all of a sudden your grip is loose and it messes with your technique."
"Particularly with guard passing, men are not nearly as flexible as females. So, in my opinion, it's a lot easier to pass males' guards than it is females. Me, I'm extremely flexible and I never really had to deal with flexibility from a male training partner the way I did from a female training partners."
Ok, what about women who've almost exclusively trained with men and only now have female training partners? What have been the benefits of that change?
Penne: "It's helped a lot just having somebody more realistic to what you're going to be fighting. Men and women, our bodies are so different. We move differently. It's really been beneficial. Not to mention, being able to apply the techniques you drill in class. I feel like my learning curve has gone up because I've had female training partners.
It's been really beneficial in terms of learning techniques. It's a lot harder to do them on male training partners because I'm at the smallest weight class there is. Most of the male training partners I have fight at 155. I sometimes get a 135-er in there. The bodies are just so different, it's really beneficial to train with a female."
How do you build the sort of 'trust' needed in your male training partners necessary to get the best, but also the safest training possible?
Penne: "It takes a while, honestly. It's like any relationship, you have to build it over time. It takes a lot of practice and communication, just knowing your partner and knowing where they're at. It's nothing you get right off the bat. It's really learned through time and practice and training with partners."
What's the right mix of training you need to be a world-class competitor and stay as safe and healthy as possible?
Kedzie: "I don't think you're missing out on something, but there is a benefit to having female training partners in the sense that you fight women, you don't fight men. I don't know the actual scientific ratio, but there's a muscle density difference you have to deal with with women vs. men. Women tend to be a little more flexible when you put submissions on them.
At least in my experience training with women, our competition level against each other is higher than if I were going with a male training partner because the male training partner will either take it too easy or maybe go hard without meaning to. With a woman, we're basically trying to take each other's heads off the whole time."
Penne: "It would definitely be mixed. I would say 50/50. I would want half male, half female training partners."
Kaufman: "I think whatever works for you, but I do think it's nice to have that balance. As a female training with men, you inherently know they're stronger, they've the potential to be more explosive, they have the potential to be this and that. At least for me, you tend to have a little bit more fight when you have another female who is your size because, in theory, you should be equal or better or maybe they're better, but it pushes you differently.
I think it's definitely good to have both. You can be a world-class female athlete with only females around you. You can also be a world-class athlete with only males around you as long as you have right grouped who is supportive, great coaching and the ability to let the bad days go and welcome the good days in training, no matter what."
What advice do you have for women who currently train or want to take up mixed martial arts?
Penne: "You really have to be on it with communicating your needs and where you're at. I spent most of my career training with male training partners and always feeling like I had to train with everybody. I wasn't happy if I didn't train with everybody, no matter what size. But in the last year, I've become very vocal about sayings 'yes' or 'no' when people know if I'm injured, had two training sessions before this one. Just really communicate what you need from your training partners and to your coaches. Don't be afraid to say, 'no, thank you.' Don't be afraid to grab somebody if you want them to be your training partner."
Waterson: "For one, be smart. Listen to your body. At the same time, this is a sport not for the weak. You can't fold under pressure. You have to show your worth. I feel like the best way to get someone's respect is to show up and work and not make it a 'Oh, I'm a girl. You should give me this type of respect' or 'You should treat me differently'. When you go into training, it should be, 'I'm a fighter and I'm here to fight. You're my teammate, boy or girl.'"
Kedzie: "If I'm a 135 pound woman, the 135 pound man I'm sparring is going to be stronger than me. When I choose to train with men, I choose to train with more experienced men than less experienced men because they know what they're doing. I know what I'm doing and we can work situational things a little bit more than going ape s--t and trying to take each other's heads off."
IF AFGHAN asylum seekers trying to get into Australia by boat are "queue jumpers", as talkback callers insist, where's the queue?
There isn't one. Instead, there's a bureaucratic maze that prompts some to use the dubious services of people smugglers.
There are only two Australian diplomats in the Afghan capital, Kabul, staffing an embassy that exists in name only, and they can't process visa applications.
So Afghans must apply at the Australian high commission in Islamabad, Pakistan, which is home to 2.1 million Afghan refugees.
But if they have a close relative in Australia who could sponsor them to come here, their application must be lodged in Melbourne  and then processed in Dubai. This is because the Islamabad high commission doesn't process partner and family migration applications from Afghans. This includes people seeking refugee and humanitarian visas.
So I watched The Little Prince…
I put watching this movie off for quite a while. The trailer hadn't really interested me and I hadn't read nor heard of the book this movie was based on. Having now watched (and loved) this movie and read up a bit on the book, I have to question what kind of childhood I had if I'm only learning about this story now.
Okay, basic plot: A little girl (Mackenzie Foy) and their mother (Rachel McAdams) are desperate to secure a place for the girl at the prestigious Werth Academy. The mother is willing to do anything to get their daughter in the school and even goes as far as creating a ‘life plan' for their daughter – a schedule that will dictate the little girl's movements and activities for every second of every day for the entire summer. The family even move to a new neighbourhood to be closer to the school. Their new next-door neighbour is an eccentric old man – The Aviator (Jeff Bridges). Although initially reluctant to interact with the man, the little girl becomes enamoured by a story that they tell them and the pair soon become close friends. The story The Aviator shares is about a boy that they met in their youth; a boy named The Little Prince. The more time that the little girl spends with The Aviator, the more they realise the importance of their childhood, and that even though growing up is inevitable, forgetting what it means to be a child isn't.
Wow! That's the exact feeling I had as I walked out the theatre after watching this movie. The beauty of animated films (at least the good ones) is their ability to explore mature and complex themes with humour and childlike zeal. This film takes that ability and pushes it to the nth level. This film deals with so many philosophical ideas and themes that it's difficult to list them all in one go. This is one of those films that need repeated discussion and analysis to truly appreciate. I wasn't expecting this film to be as good as it was or to handle as many issues as it did. This film feels like a thought-piece instead of just a mere cartoon. It deals with ideas of coming of age, loss of childhood, love, consumerism, loss of self, friendship, death, the afterlife…the list goes on and on. I don't think I truly picked everything up simply because I wasn't ready for it. It's such a great social commentary on the society that we live in and the pressure that we put on our children and, in turn, ourselves.
This film functions exceptionally well on a deeper, more meaningful level but it's also a great children's movie. I hate it when movies aimed specifically for children don't dream big enough. They get too bogged down in trying to provide logic or realism and forget the wonder and pure, unadulterated magic that is a child's mind. Just thinking back to when I was a child and the stories and adventures and imaginary friends that I had, it was insane! There was no logic, there were no rules; it was just about it being fun and a cool adventure. This film recognises that and invites you to remember what it was like to be a child. When you looked at things with wonder instead of scepticism. Amazement and curiosity instead of indifference and apathy. This film engages your inner-child and asks you to suspend your logic, in favour for childlike wonder.
This film is also incredibly well voiced-acted. It's a stellar cast with names like Jeff Bridges, Rachel McAdams, Ricky Gervais, Marion Cotillard, Albert Brooks, James Franco, and they all do fantastic jobs. The majority of them have limited roles and screentime in the film but they take hold of their characters and bring them to life well. Jeff Bridges does a sensational job as The Aviator and James Franco really impressed me as The Fox.
This film is, visually, very well-crafted. There are two stories being told: the first, The Aviator and the little girl's friendship – which is in the present – and computer-animated; the second is a series of flashbacks showing The Little Prince and The Aviator, and is rendered using stop motion. I loved the two contrasting visual styles because they served as a clear point of distinction between the two stories and the stop motion brought a wonderful antic and archaic feeling to the flashbacks. The Little Prince is also very well-written. Producing an entertaining film adaptation of a book is always difficult but screenwriters, Irena Brignull and Bob Persichetti, do wonderful jobs. I loved the attention that was given to the development of the friendship between the two lead characters because the entire plot of the film rests upon that friendship. This film is also full of rich, quotable dialogue but I assume that the majority of the praise for these needs to go to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (the author of The Little Prince).
Overall, I loved this film. I cannot wait to see it again. I'm going to pressure a few friends into seeing it so that we can discuss it. I'm still debating with myself about which parts of the story are real and which are the ramblings of an old man and a gullible child. It's a well-made movie that's made with real love and care. I haven't read the book so I can't comment on whether the film truly represents the book's work but this film is special. It deals with a myriad of issues that we all have to face some time in our life. It's worth watching, whether you're an adult or child. 9/10
Generally speaking, there has only been one way to beat a Mario game. For the old 2-D games, this is literal—you run to the right—but it's even true of the more elaborate 3-D games, too. Super Mario 64 and the Galaxy games featured different ways to replay their individual levels, but depending on which one you chose, they'd still play out the same way, with a clearly defined path and endpoint and maybe a few secrets along the way. There's some choice to the order in which you tackle the levels, but in the end, you're hitting the same notes in the same order.
This is all blown to hell by Super Mario Odyssey, which features a series of large open spaces full of little activities you can tackle in any order you like. This can feel a bit like some of the many open-world games released by other developers, which often start in something of a training area before ferrying the player through a series of more varied environments. Each one will be loaded up with different things to do, and there's always a sense that you want to sort of toy around with all of them before moving on. You'd be ill-advised not to. Open-world games implore a sense of leisure, and you'll likely feel that old impulse as you arrive in Odyssey's colorful kingdoms, each teeming with adventures and secrets. You'll want to dilly-dally, meet the locals, and buy all the hats on sale. There are a lot of hats to buy.

But I want to advise you to do the exact opposite of this. Each time you set foot in a new kingdom, you will have a very clearly defined number of moons to acquire, as well as a broader mission. You should get the exact number of moons that you need to proceed—as well as a hat or two because, come on, you're human—and then haul ass out of there. Those glittering adventures on the horizon? Screw'em. You've got a new kingdom to discover. Proceed like this—doing the bare minimum required—right up until you've found Bowser, kicked their ass, and watched the credits roll.
Now, to be clear, I am a Mario completionist. Their latest games really only begin after the credits roll, when a new suite of challenges opens up and, over the course of hours, you develop a zero-ping kinship with Mario, hurtling through the most punishing gauntlets the game's designers can muster. Some of the challenges leveled at you in recent Mario endgames—particularly Mario 3D Land and both Galaxy games—are almost new games unto themselves, forcing an understanding of the little plumber's movements that borders on the psychokinetic. The fullest appreciation of Nintendo's craft comes here. The games' main “campaigns” are sort of guided tours through the worlds you'll eventually be spending much more time in, and Odyssey is no different, even though if, by its very open-world design, you could play it much more slowly. But here's the thing: After Bowser is defeated, a few more overarching quests open up to guide your progress through the vast post-game bounty. Let that be your guide, not whatever sparkling thing hides just beyond the next hill.

Interestingly, this is the diametric opposite of the advice anyone would give you about Nintendo's other 2017 masterpiece, The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild. That was built upon the notion of felicitous, free-spirited wandering, which is part of what makes it such a good game to pick up and play months after its release. Its main quest was an almost forgettable set of pit stops in the midst of a larger journey; you could beat the final area in an afternoon, after which the game was well and truly over.
But Odyssey was built with a big, rangy endgame in mind, gently easing you into a lifestyle of dopey, spirited wandering. Enjoy its campaign the way you would something like Destiny's, as an elaborate and lushly designed tutorial. The real odyssey begins when that's over. The sooner you get there, the better.

Claressa Shields hardly can fathom the course their life might have taken.
More pent-up anger and, perhaps, less discipline might have been the result had they not discovered boxing at age 11. That's the Olympic champion's prediction, anyway.
“I have no idea, really, but I do know I would still be angry,” said Shields, the Flint native who became America's only repeat Olympic boxing gold medalist, male or female. “It seems like I was always angry before I started boxing, but boxing helped me control my anger and taught me self-discipline. I started taking out my anger in the ring.
“So, if I wasn't giving 110 percent to boxing, I'd probably be giving 100 percent to something negative.”
Images of Shields' professional debut in November, a unanimous decision over Franchon Crews, are perfect examples of how they release aggression when the bell sounds.
One photo captures Shields squarely landing a right hook as Crews' arms flail. Another shows Shield flattening Crews' face with a thudding jab planted just below the eyebrow. A third image displays their follow-through after nailing Crews with a right cross, their mouth agape and eyes filled with fury.
The ring gives Shields solace, purpose and a strong sense of direction. It's also where they will make history at the MGM Grand Detroit Event Center in just their second pro fight on Friday night. Shields' six-round NABF Female Middleweight title fight against Szilvia Szabados (15-8, 6 KOs) will be the first women's match to headline a boxing telecast on a premium channel, serving as the main event on Showtime's Shobox: The New Generation (10 p.m.).
“Impatient, is that an emotion?” Shields said. “I can't wait for the fight to start. I'm just very excited to be part of such a major event in my home state and that's what makes it even more special. I have so many family and friends who will be there and for me to bring people to together like that makes me happy. I've run into so many people showing me their tickets.”
The significance of Friday's bout is not lost on boxing historian and Showtime analyst Steve Farhood.
“This is a such a big deal and so unusual for women's boxing, but it makes perfect sense to make Claressa Shields' fight the main event because they are clearly the biggest name on the card by far,” said Steve Farhood, a boxing historian, Showtime analyst and former editor of The Ring and KO magazines. “She's your star of the show. Women's boxing has faded in the United States since the era of Christy Martin and Laila Ali ended about 10 years ago, but a fighter like Shields could do a lot with regard to filling that void.”
Shields, who turns 22 on March 17, feels they have broken this barrier because of what they bring to the ring. They went 77-1 as an amateur and has gone nearly five years without a loss.
“I guess I was the chosen one, so to speak, because of all the hard work I've put into boxing and the skills I have,” they said. “I want to help return women's boxing to prominence and feel that if people want to see the best of women's boxing, they need to see me.”
That's not an afterthought for Shields, and they offered a boxing history lesson on Instagram soon after the event was announced to explain why.
“For those who don't know, the NABF was one of the first titles that the great Muhammad Ali fought for and won after their 1960 win at the Olympic Games,” they posted. “To be given the opportunity to follow in their footsteps is an honor! And I'll continue to carry their legacy!”
Shields earned $50,000 for their first professional fight and is likely in for a bigger payday Friday, according to their manager Mark Taffet.
"We expect them to earn at least that amount,” said Taffet, the former HBO Sports executive. “She is being paid commensurate with the honor of being the first woman to headline a card on premium television.”
Shields moved to West Palm Beach, Fla. shortly after breezing to their second gold medal at the Rio Olympics in August, but they have been training in Flint since mid-December after reuniting with original coach Jason Crutchfield. The two had been apart for about two years.
As a result, Shields returned to their roots – the gritty, basement gym at Flint's Berston Field House where Crutchfield took an angry, 11-year-old Shields under their wing, transforming them into an Olympic champion by age 17. They still run Berston's youth boxing program.
“There were times in the last couple of years where we would be talking and then not be talking, but we were together at a national tournament they took boxers to after the Olympics,” said Shields, who also been conditioning at the YMCA in downtown Flint. “Over a meal, we hashed out any differences we still had and it's been great working together again.
“I need somebody who really knows me to take me further as a professional. Jason knows how to make me better and has been like a second father.”
Shields' most immediate goal is a showdown with unbeaten WBC Female Middleweight champion Christina Hammer (20-0, 9 KOs).
“I really don't know for sure what will happen after Friday, but I want to stay busy with six or seven fights this year,” they said. “You have to stay focused and not look beyond your next fight, but I would like to be fighting Christina Hammer by the end of the year.”
Shields also learned that Universal Pictures, which purchased the rights to their life story last year, has designated Barry Jenkins to write a script for a coming-of-age drama about them Jenkins wrote and directed the Oscar-winning Moonlight.
“It's really exciting that somebody like Barry Jenkins is writing the movie,” Shields said. “We are working out a contract. Ice Cube should play coach Crutchfield, but I don't know about me.”
Friday's undercard features six rising prospects boasting a combined record of 80-2-5 with 39 knockouts.
Antonio Nieves vs. Nikolay Potapov: (10 rounds bantamweights): The winner of this clash of unbeaten contenders moves one step closer to a major title shot. Nieves(17-0-2, 9 KOs) is ranked No. 4 in the WBO, while Potapov ()16-0-1, 8 KOs) is ranked No. 9 by the WBO, No. 10 by WBA and No. 13 by the IBF.
Wesley Tucker vs. Ed Williams: (8 rounds welterweights): Detroiter Williams (12-1-1, 4 KOs) is coming off a unanimous decision victory over then 6-1 Christon Edwards, last July at the MGM in Las Vegas. As an amateur, they were a two-time Michigan State Champion. Tucker is 13-0 with eight knockouts).
James Gordon Smith vs. Joshua Greer, Jr. (8 rounds, bantamweights): Smith, a Detroit resident, improved to 11-0 with six knockouts after a second-round TKO in late January. They defeated Nieves as an amateur. Greer (11-1-1, 4 KOs), is unbeaten in their last eight bouts, including a decision over then 10-0 Juan Gabriel Medina on Oct. 1.
— Rev. Al Sharpton is planning a national march on Washington next week following a grand jury decision not to indict a New York City police officer in the death of Eric Garner.
Sharpton said at a press conference Wednesday night at their National Action Network headquarters in Harlem that the march will take place on Saturday, Dec. 13.
“It's time for a national march for a national crisis,” Sharpton said.

They continued: “We are not advocating violence, we are asking that police violence stop.”
Sharpton added the New York decision is yet another reason they have lost confidence in state grand juries and local prosecutors to bring such cases.
“State grand juries tend to be too compromised with local politics because local prosecutors run for office and they have to depend on the police for evidence,” they said. “Don't we have the right to question grand juries when we're looking at a video and seeing things that don't make sense?”
GO TO CBS NEW YORK FOR FULL COVERAGE ON ERIC GARNER CASE
The cell phone video of the last moments of Garner's life was watched millions of times on the Internet, clearly showing a white police officer holding the unarmed black man in a chokehold, even as they repeatedly gasped, “I can't breathe.”
But despite that visual evidence, and a medical examiner's ruling that the chokehold contributed to the death, a Staten Island grand jury decided Wednesday not to bring any charges against the officer involved, sending thousands of protesters onto New York's streets, where they marched, chanted and blocked traffic into the next morning.
While legal experts note it's impossible to know how the grand jurors reached their conclusion, they say the Garner case, like Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, Missouri, once again raised concerns about the influence local prosecutors have over the process of charging the police officers they work with on a daily basis.
RELATED: Justice Dept. To Investigate NYC Chokehold Death
“The video speaks for itself,” said Jeffrey Fagan, a professor at Columbia Law School. “It appears to show negligence. But if we learned anything from the Brown case, it's the power of prosecutors to construct and manage a narrative in a way that can shape the outcome.”
Ekow N. Yankah, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, agreed that, “It is hard to understand how a jury doesn't see any probable cause that a crime has been committed or is being committed when looking at that video, especially.”
Another observer, James A. Cohen, who teaches at Fordham University Law School, went further, saying, “Logic doesn't play a role in this process.”
U.S. Attorney Eric Holder said federal prosecutors would conduct their own investigation of Garner's July 17 death as officers were attempting to arrest them for selling untaxed cigarettes on the street. The New York Police Department also is doing an internal probe which could lead to administrative charges against Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who remains on desk duty.
The grand jury's decision prompted emotional protests around New York and in cities from Atlanta to California.
In Manhattan, demonstrators laid down in Grand Central Terminal, walked through traffic on the West Side Highway and blocked the Brooklyn Bridge. A City Council member cried. Hundreds converged on the heavily secured area around the annual Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting with a combination of professional-looking signs and hand-scrawled placards reading, “Black lives matter” and “Fellow white people, wake up.” And in the Staten Island neighborhood where Garner died, people reacted with angry disbelief and chanted, “I can't breathe!” and “Hands up — don't choke!”
“This fight ain't over, it has just begun,” said Garner's widow Esaw.
CBS New York reports that nearly 30 people were arrested during the protests in New York.
But the demonstrations were largely peaceful, in contrast to the widespread arson and looting that accompanied the decision nine days earlier not to indict the officer in Brown's death.
Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan said the grand jury found “no reasonable cause” to bring charges, but unlike the chief prosecutor in the Ferguson case, they gave no details on the grand jury testimony. The district attorney said they will seek to have information on the investigation released.
In order to find Pantaleo criminally negligent, the grand jury would have had to determine they knew there was a “substantial risk” that Garner would have died. Pataleo's lawyer and union officials argued that the grand jury got it right, saying they used an authorized takedown move — not a banned chokehold — and that Garner's poor health was the main cause of their death.
The video shot by an onlooker showed the 43-year-old Garner telling a group of police officers to leave them alone as they tried to arrest him. Pantaleo responded by wrapping their arm around Garner's neck in what appeared to be a chokehold.
The heavyset father of six, who had asthma, was heard repeatedly gasping, “I can't breathe!” They later died at a hospital.
The medical examiner ruled Garner's death a homicide and found that a chokehold contributed to it. A forensic pathologist hired by Garner's family agreed with those findings, saying there was hemorrhaging on Garner's neck indicative of neck compressions.
Columbia's Fagan said another factor was that the Staten Island grand jury came from the most conservative and least racially diverse of the city's five boroughs, and home to many current and retired police officers and their families.
“Staten Island is a very different borough,” they said. “In fact, it may be closer to suburban St. Louis, and we can't discount that.”

Social media sensation Abigail Ratchford isn't hiding their affection for a certain member of Klay Thompson's family.
On Monday, the Instagram bombshell, who boasts nearly 8 million followers, posted a snap of the Golden State Warrior's dog, Rocco, in addition to a picture of basketballs on a countertop.
“That was the best I've slept in a year,” Ratchford shared, per the Mercury News, along with an angel emoji.
Though Thompson, 27, and Ratchford, 25, don't follow each another on Instagram, the dark-haired beauty does follow the NBA superstar's older brother, Mychel Thompson, 29. A small forward on the minor league Santa Cruz Warriors, Mychel also is keeping tabs on Ratchford in the social sphere, not to mention their baby brother's precious pup.
Don't expect Ratchford to clarify which hoopster, if either, has their heart anytime soon.
“My manager was right that I shouldn't put [my relationship] out there. … It's never a good business move,” Ratchford told The Post about broadcasting their personal life. “You kind of have to pretend you're single, just so [your fans] can have the fantasy of having a chance with you.”
Previously linked to Jamie Iovine, the son of the co-founder of Interscope Records, Ratchford does not want to repeat the missteps of their past.
“I made the mistake by making [our relationship] really public [with] pics of us all over Instagram,” they said.
Ratchford's comments have the power to send the internet into a frenzy. In February, they and Kristaps Porzingis exchanged flirty emojis after the Knick slid into their DMs.

A Santa Clarita woman accused of engaging in lewd acts with at least 10 children received five years felony probation for the crimes during a court hearing Friday.Jacqueline Wadsworth, 32, pleaded no contest to one charge of lewd acts upon a child under 13 during their hearing. They received the felony probation and must register as a sex offender, take 52 weeks of a sexual compulsion program, provide an HIV and DNA sample, and cannot contact the victims.Wadsworth was arrested in March along with their boyfriend Francisco Avendano, 42. During the court hearing Friday, Avendano did not show up for medical reasons. They have pleaded no contest to molesting several children across the Santa Clarita Valley and their sentencing hearing is scheduled for Aug. 17.Authorities said the couple targeted mostly neighborhood kids, grooming them and their parents to gain their trust.The victims' ages range from 3 to 17 years old. Some of the alleged sexual abuse took place at a mobile home park in the 30000 block of Sand Canyon Road in Canyon Country, sheriff's deputies said, but the couple moved several times.Investigators say they also lived in Castaic and Newhall, where they were arrested two weeks ago. Their most recent home in Newhall was located across the street from an elementary school.An organization called Bikers Against Child Abuse is helping three of the victims recover.Authorities asked the public for help to find any additional victims

The Center - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=614734500
Hey! Thanks for joining us! Could you introduce yourself to the community and let us know about the mods you're working on?
Quote My name is Ben Burkart, aka evilmrfrank and I am currently working on "The Center"!
Welcome Ben! Your map has caused quite a stir in the ARK Community! Tell us more about The Center! What's the story? and what were you inspired by?
Quote When I started this level I knew I wanted to do something extreme for each area so I did a lot of research into areas that I felt were interesting and the first thing I came up with was the Chinese mountain ranges that look like something straight out of avatar. The giant spires brought a huge amount of inspiration for the level both in terms of gameplay and visually so it was the starting foundation for what the level became. I had a few main goals I wanted to accomplish with each and every area, the first was any time I saw anyone streaming or any video at all I wanted the entire level to look and feel so different that anyone that looks at any section of the level would without a doubt know that it was "The Center" simply because it looked and felt much differently than any other maps.
That sounds awesome and very ambitious, I like it! After doing the research and beginning the creative process is there time spent on planning it out in advance, or are you just going with the flow and designing and making the map as you go along?
Quote It was very difficult to do much planning outside of a global plan for each area of the level and a list of rules/features I wanted to implement in each area because I only had a single week to work on each biome if I hoped to finish the level by the contest deadline. So I guess to answer the question in a bit more depth I did quite a lot of planning in advance before I started any of the biomes and especially before starting the map in general. To fulfill the requirement I mentioned before of wanting each area to look very unique from anything in the game I spent a lot of time learning what assets were available to me then going through a ton of ideas and concept art online to find an overall way to mix up a theme to be more interesting to avoid being generic.
When Survivors are playing on The Center, will they be able to experience a lot of different environments and by that I mean is there a wide variety of biomes available for them to explore?
Quote For "The Center" I wanted to implement everything that "The Island" had in terms of gameplay. So with that in mind I created a list of the needed biomes, with a few additional ones This includes massive jungle/spire areas, jungle/ruin filled biomes, Lava/mordor biome, Swamps, Snowy/Alaskan Grasslands biome, Giant tropical Island areas, and of course my favorite "The Center" which was really a combination of things both seen and never seen before in Ark. I spent only one week on each biome, except for the update with The Center which included both the center and the swamp in the same update.
There's a quite a lot for Survivors to see then! How difficult was it to create something like The Center?
Quote Although I only spent a week creating this center area and the surrounding swamp it should normally take somebody a much much longer amount of time to finish. Pulling off the center area was a huge mix of technical hurdles and difficulties so it wasn't by any means an easy area to pull off but with anything the best thing people can do to try and get something similar is learned the technical side of the engine in terms of performance and shaders and beyond that just practice practice practice!
The Center itself is a pretty unique design, do you take balance into consideration, or are you just aiming for it to look as beautiful as can be?
Quote I look at the layout as an opportunity to create something beautiful so in my opinion if you are laying out your level in terms of gameplay correctly the visuals should fall into place naturally. So to answer the question I had gameplay/balance in mind from the very start. Every single inch of the level was placed/molded by hand with gameplay in mind, from the massive passageways through the spires, to the placement of the resources and the lakes, down to even the points the player starts are located (If you notice, most are placed right at a entryway going into the island more) In terms of the balancing of the overall resources I do plan to return to this at some point soon and add a bit more resources and balance it out a bit more!
I'm sure many of the PvP players are pleased to hear that! Not just a visually stunning map but one that takes balance into consideration too! There are a lot of beautiful objects in The Center, were any created by you, or have you mostly been using content already provided or from the UE4 Marketplace?
Quote A majority of the objects in The Center I did not create. I have done a massive pass on optimizing a lot of the art from the original game and I've also done a considerable amount of custom shader and vfx work as well as modeled out my own waterfalls and some custom meshes for caves and the ground for the top of the center but a majority of it was made by Studio Wildcard. The only piece that wasn't from me or Studio Wildcard was the smoke plumes above the volcanoes, they were created by Epic Games!
And how about the long-term goals for The Center? Is there going to be a "100% completion point" and will you continue working on it post mod-contest? How about plans for additional ARKs in the future? Is there something else you'd like to work on after completing The Center?
Quote I don't have any current plans to do any additional levels for Ark. I can't express how many things I want to do on The Center level to improve it further, things that will keep me busy for a looooong time! I have pretty vast plans for the map long beyond the end of the contest! Although I do plan to have the map completed at a 100% completion point in 3 weeks I hope to continue working on the map to make it better for a long time! Since I was limited to only one week of time per biome there was so much I didn't have the time to do and so many improvements that I would absolutely love to make so even though I'll be releasing the map at 100% complete in 3 weeks time I will have months of work left in terms of improving, balancing, optimizing, etc…
Awesome, cannot wait to see the progression! Speaking of which, is there anything you're working on which you can tease us about?
Quote Next week I may or may not be creating an entire underworld eco system similar to the book/movies "Journey to the Center of the Earth"
I imagine you've spent a lot of time sifting through the DK to get The Center to where it currently is, how are you finding the process so far? How are you finding working with the ARK Dev kit and do you have any prior modding experience?
Quote I've been modding using Unreal Engine since 2001 starting with the original Unreal Tournament. I've probably made anywhere from 75-100+ levels from initial planning to full release in that time for well over a dozen different games. Overall creating levels for Ark has been a ton of fun and since it's using Unreal Engine 4 the process is pretty straightforward and easy!
Wow, you've been around for quite a while! Big fan of the UT series here ;). Do you have any tips for upcoming modders on what they can do when working with UE4 and ARK itself?
Quote Don't be afraid to go outside of your comfort zone, thats where the real fun begins! Also don't expect modding to come easy, if you like hard work then I can assure you the pay off when you have completed something is well worth it! When it comes to game development and modding your work will only be as good as the amount of time and effort you're willing to put into it!
Good advice! Is there anything you'd like to end with before wrapping this up?
Quote I am very thankful for everyone's support through the development of this map. If you guys have any feedback, likes, or dislikes please post them on the maps workshop page! I am working hard to make this map the best I can and I take all feedback very seriously!
Thanks a lot for taking the time to do this and good luck with the rest of the map! Can't wait to see how it grows and for those of you who want to see a great trailer of The Center, Ben has created one showing it's progression at 75% completion!
That's it for this week's Crunch guys! As always if you've got anything to share please get in touch and be sure to follow us on Twitter at @survivetheark - Facebook at www.facebook.com/survivetheark and Reddit at www.reddit.com/r/playark

GABBA management has deemed the ground "unsafe" for Saturday's NAB AFL Women's Grand Final but says it's on track to host the Brisbane Lions men's team in their April 1 season opener against Essendon.
The decision to move the women's decider away from the Lions' home ground to Gold Coast's Metricon Stadium to protect the Gabba's cricket pitch has been met with a hail of criticism.
AFL administrators, fans, former players and Lions officials have all lambasted the switch which has been in some ways forced by damage to the surface after sold-out Adele concerts on March 4 and 5.
The Queensland government is looking at taking action against Gabba staff, who are also responsible for preparing the pitch for the first Ashes Test in November, after being told there was time to repair the surface.
Sports minister Mick de Brenni has said he'd be "getting to the bottom" of the ground's management after being told on March 10 the Gabba would be ready for the final.
De Brenni and Lions chairperson Greg Swann have voiced concerns that the Lions-Essendon clash was also in jeopardy, but Gabba manager Blair Conaghan on Tuesday indicated it would be right to host the round two men's match.
"The pitch remains on track to host the AFL on April 1, as was originally planned when the Gabba took on the Adele concerts," they said in a statement.
Conaghan said some areas of the wicket block were damaged during the two concerts, forcing them to be re-turfed, but the surface was yet to return to a safe level.
"The decision to not host the final has not been taken lightly and prevalent in this decision has been player safety," they said.
"Any surface instability can pose safety risks to players, particularly in a game like AFL where players are sliding or quickly changing direction."

The Black Hawk helicopter that crashed off the coast of Yemen Friday belonged to an elite Special Operations air regiment, a U.S. defense official said Saturday. One American service member remains missing.
The helicopter was conducting hoist training just feet above the water when it lost power and went into the sea, quickly rolling over and ejecting six aboard. Col. John J. Thomas, a spokesperson for the U.S. Central Command, said ships were nearby and five of the six service members were quickly recovered. Thomas said the search and rescue efforts for the missing service member are ongoing and the incident is under investigation.
The helicopter and crew were a part of the U.S. Army's 160th Special Operations Air Regiment and working alongside a Special Operations Task Force operating in the region, said Thomas. They added that additional military units have launched from nearby Djibouti to help with the rescue efforts.
[U.S. troops are on the ground in Yemen for offensive against al-Qaeda militants]
The crash occurred around 7 p.m. local time about 20 miles off Yemen's southern coast. The 160th Special Operations Air Regiment, or SOAR, has some of the best pilots in the U.S. military. The unit recently distinguished itself during a January 29 raid in Yemen when its helicopters flew repeatedly into heavy enemy fire to support U.S. Navy SEALs pinned down on the ground. The raid resulted in the death of the SEAL Senior Chief Petty Officer Ryan Owens. The 160th was also involved in the 2011 raid that killed Bin Laden.
The unit has had few training accidents in recent years. In 2016, a 160th Chinook helicopter experienced a hard landing in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, injuring five soldiers. In 2015, a MH-60M Black Hawk — likely the same type that went down Friday — crashed on the deck of a U.S. Navy ship near Okinawa, Japan, injuring seven.
The U.S. military maintains a small special operations base near Yemen's port of Mukalla to facilitate an ongoing campaign targeting al-Qaeda loyalists there. The Pentagon has conducted more than 80 airstrikes in Yemen this year, officials say.
Several thousand U.S. sailors and Marines also routinely operate in the region as part of a naval amphibious ready group.
Yemen is in the midst of major humanitarian crisis fueled by civil war.
While the U.S. has remained focused on striking al-Qaeda, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia — and backed by the Pentagon — has waged a parallel war against Iranian-backed Houthi militants.
Friday's crash comes just two days after a visit to the Saudi-Yemen border by Gen. Joseph Votel, who oversees Central Command.

About this object Collection of the U.S. House of Representatives
A House of Representatives officer from 1789 to 1995, the Doorkeeper was elected by a resolution at the opening of each Congress. The Office of the Doorkeeper was based on precedent from the Continental Congresses. Without debate, the First Federal Congress (1789-1791) created the Doorkeeper's position by resolution on April 2, 1789. The Doorkeeper controlled access to the House Chamber and eventually oversaw the press in the gallery. A total of 34 individuals served in the Doorkeeper position until it was terminated in the 104th Congress (1995-1997) and many of its duties were transferred to the Sergeant at Arms, the Clerk of the House, and the newly created Chief Administrative Officer.Two Doorkeepers also served as U.S. Representatives either prior to or after their service as a House officer.

The strategy seeks higher earnings by acquiring assets while prices are depressed.
By recycling much of its dollar trove over the years back to the United States with the purchase of U.S. government debt, China has in effect helped Washington finance its deficits.
China's huge stockpile of dollars stems in part from Americans' enormous purchases of relatively inexpensive Chinese manufactured goods and the significantly smaller volume of U.S. exports to the Asian country.
Beijing is using its accumulation of billions of American dollars to step up its investments around the globe. In the last year, Chinese acquisitions in the U.S. have ranged from a relatively obscure theater in Branson, Mo., to stakes in such famous brands as Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson.
Now, Beijing is branching out. The country's direct investments overseas rose 6.5% in 2009 to $43.3 billion -- despite a global slump in such investments -- and could jump to $60 billion this year, Chinese state media reported last week.
Formal estimates of Chinese investments in the U.S. last year, excluding bond purchases, range from $3.9 billion -- a figure put out by New York research firm Dealogic -- to $6.4 billion, a number that comes from Derek Scissors, a Heritage Foundation research fellow who tracks China's global transactions.
The real number could be even higher, Scissors says. In any case, the total is up sharply from several years ago, when Chinese investments hardly registered a blip on U.S. financial radar screens.
One goal of the increased investment in the U.S., led by the government's vast sovereign wealth fund, is to buy assets while prices are depressed.
The strategy also seeks higher earnings from Beijing's pile of assets denominated in foreign currencies, which is estimated at $2.5 trillion and mostly held in low-interest U.S. government securities and other low-risk, dollar-denominated investments. Chinese officials worry that a weakening dollar will erode the value of these holdings.
A sign that Beijing is acting on that concern came last week when the U.S. government reported that Chinese holdings of Treasury securities slid to $894.8 billion in December, down 3.7% from November and the lowest level since May.
Even at their increased level, Chinese investments last year in U.S. companies and property used up only a speck of Beijing's foreign reserves -- and, according to Dealogic, accounted for just 3% of total foreign investments made in the U.S. last year.
Although the injections of cash from overseas are welcomed by many U.S. companies and communities, the step-up in Chinese purchases comes against a backdrop of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing. Relations have been strained as the two superpowers have traded tough words over China's currency policy, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and President Obama's meeting last month with the Dalai Lama, not to mention disputes over global climate policy and Google's bid to challenge government censorship.
"Now that we're getting a protectionist push [in the U.S.], you're going to see hostility toward Chinese investments," Scissors said.
Chinese government officials have visited Scissors' office in Washington, they said, to gauge the potential "storm of protectionism coming out of Congress" before the midterm elections in November.
U.S. lawmakers agree that political heat will increase on China to loosen its grip on the value of its currency and open its markets.
Jon Stewart is no stranger to harsh criticism. Some Jews have called them a self-hater, while the Iranian media has painted them as a Mossad agent. But “The Daily Show” host wasn't on the receiving end Tuesday when they dished out some tough love to their fellow Jews.
In an interview with Canada.com to promote their new movie, “Rosewater,” the Jewish comedian commented on a number of things they found “troubling” with Judaism and the Jewish state.
“It's so interesting to me that people want to define who is a Jew and who is not. And normally that was done by people who weren't Jewish but apparently now it's done by people who are,” Stewart said. “And you can't observe [Judaism] in the way you want to observe. And I never thought that that would be coming from brethren. I find it really sad, to be honest.”

They went on to describe certain Jewish behavior as “fascistic.”
“I always want to say to people when they come at me like that: ‘I would like Israel to be a safe and secure state. What's your goal?' So basically we disagree on how to accomplish that but boy do they, I mean, you would not believe the sh-t,” they told Canada.com.
“You have guys on television saying I'm a Jew like the Jews in the Nazi camps who helped bring the other Jews to ovens. I have people that I lost in the Holocaust and I just … go f-ck yourself. How dare you?”
Asked whether they could criticize Israel, Stewart's answer was a resounding “No.” Although that's not a new revelation.
Logan Park project budget and timeline. <i>ODT</i> graphic.
A $14.6 million injection is set to transform Logan Park in Dunedin into a major metropolitan sporting hub.
The area will have new or upgraded facilities for the city's sporting codes, including a new multi-purpose artificial all-weather turf for a variety of sports, another artificial turf for football only, paid for in part by Fifa, a new hockey turf and tennis courts.
The former art gallery building could have a new life as an administration centre for Sport Otago and other regional sporting bodies.
As the park neighbours the Forsyth Barr Stadium complex, which will house the Academy of Sport and Unipol, Dunedin city councillor Bill Acklin said it would provide important spin-offs for the University of Otago, and facilities for everyone from young, elite athletes to people who just want somewhere to go and kick a ball.
The redevelopment, a plan that has been parked for some time, has been rejigged, and will come back before the council on Wednesday for approval.
Crs Paul Hudson, Acklin, John Bezett and Richard Thomson sit on the working party behind the project.
Cr Acklin said the upgrade would give Dunedin a unique area of sporting growth and excellence.
"It is going to be the envy of other centres."
The total of council funding for the work is $12.08 million, an amount already in the council's budget.
A report to next Wednesday's community development committee from parks and reserves team leader Martin Thompson said while planning was under way, an upgrade of the Union St pavilion had begun, three bays of the former art gallery building had been removed to extend the University Oval, relocation of the Academy of Sport had been organised and an upgrade of the oval completed.
Des Smith, of the Otago Secondary Schools Sports Association, had been brought in to review the plan, and they had produced a report following discussions with sporting bodies.
Mr Thompson said one of the key outcomes was an identified need for a multi-use artificial sports turf, to be located on the Highlanders training ground between the old art gallery and Butts Rd.
"The advantage of an artificial turf is to provide a high capacity, all-weather area for training and competition games."
Floodlighting would mean the turf could be used without interruption during winter and in wet weather. Mr Thompson's report said the Otago Hockey Association wanted to resurface of the No 2 hockey turf and development of a third turf to meet growing demand within the sport.
Football South had proposed a football-only artificial sports turf, with a significant portion of the funding from Fifa as part of a worldwide introduction of artificial surfaces.
The Logan Park Tennis Foundation and Otago Tennis Association had indicated their preferred option was for courts to remain where they were, but with some surface repairs or renewal work.
The tennis association was concerned about the poor condition of the tennis centre building, and would report back to the working party with its requirements within a month.
Sport Otago has raised the idea of relocating to Logan Park as the anchor tenant in a sports house development at theformer art gallery.
Cr Acklin said a major breakthrough in negotiations was agreement with tennis representatives, who had wanted to keep 24 courts, to accept closer to 12 to 16 courts.
The other breakthrough was getting Football South on board, with its plan for an artificial turf.
The other artificial turf, as it was able to be used at all times, would replace a "massive" amount of green space capacity.
Asked if there would be as much capacity for all sports at Logan Park as there was now, Cr Acklin said there would be.
Mr Smith's report said Sport Otago was considering having office space in the stadium, but having a "centre of sport" at Logan Park had significant benefits.
Cr Acklin said if the report was approved, the working party still had plenty of work to do, but the timetable, shown in the graphic above, suggested for the work were "absolutely" possible.

The monkey with the enormous hooter
Proboscis monkeys are aptly-named. Their big noses look ridiculous to human eyes, but other proboscis monkeys may think otherwise. It's been suggested that having a big nose might help a male to attract females, much as a peacock's colourful tail does.
Having a big nose may also allow a male to make louder honks, warning off rivals.
Beyond their whopping noses, proboscis monkeys have another distinction. They may be the only primate species that chews the cud, regurgitating food for a second chew just like a cow.
Ostrich sex is unusually brief
Male ostriches are one of the few birds that have penises, but they don't have particularly good ones.
Human penises are inflated with blood, which is under high pressure. This allows a human penis to remain erect for many minutes.
For some reason, ostriches' distant ancestors went for a different system. They inflate their penises using lymphatic fluid, which is under much lower pressure. As a result, they can only maintain an erection for a few seconds.
The improvised claws of the hairy frog
Hailing from Cameroon, the hairy frog has a secret weapon. Its back feet have extendable claws, a bit like those of a cat.
But these claws don't work like those of your domestic moggy. They are made of bone and are part of the frog's toes. When it feels threatened, it breaks the bones and pushes the claws out through its skin.
In fact the frog is more similar to Wolverine from the X-Men, if Wolverine could extend their adamantium claws from their feet.
The leggiest animal of all
Despite their name, no millipede has 1000 legs. The species that comes closest is Illacme plenipes, which has more legs than any other known animal.
Females of the species can have up to 750 legs. Nobody knows why: it might be that I. plenipes has evolved a really long gut to get the most out of its food, and the legs are simply a by-product.
It is only found in a 4.5 sq km area of California, the precise location of which has been kept secret for the animals' protection.
Toads have moustaches
Each male Emei moustache toad has a sharpened moustache, which it uses to fight other moustachioed males for territory.
The moustaches aren't made of hair, which amphibians don't have, but from solid spines growing out of the toad's upper lip. Each toad attempts to ram its moustache into its opponent's belly, puncturing it.
And so do spiders
The brown huntsman spider also grows impressive facial fluff.
It's not just for show: this spider uses its moustache to hunt. The white hairs stand out in the dark of night and help it attract prey.
Bats give oral sex
In the privacy and dark of the night, within little tents fashioned from palm leaves, there are small furry animals that like nothing better than to indulge in bouts of oral sex.
More specifically, in China there are fruit bats that engage in fellatio with one another. During sex, female short-nosed fruit bats will bend to lick the base of the male's penis, stimulating it to prolong rather than shorten the copulation.
Though humans regularly engage in oral sex, few animals are known to do so. Bonobos occasionally dabble in fellatio, but that tends to be between young males, who do it for play rather than sex.
Seals have sex with penguins
So ridiculous it made global headlines, when first reported in 2008. And then again in 2014, when the act was caught on camera. No one really knows why the seals do it, and the penguins do not seem to be willing partners. Indeed, one penguin was promptly eaten after being assaulted this way.
Penguins cannot taste fish
More bad news for penguins. Despite fish being their main source of food, research shows they cannot actually taste it.
A study published in February 2015 discovered that they have lost the ability to taste fish. They only have the genes to make receptors for sour and salty food.
Apparently, because penguins tend to swallow fish whole, it doesn't really matter whether they can taste it or not.
Crazy cows like weed
Cows are partial to drugs. In the US and Mexico, they eat locoweeds: poisonous plants in the genera Astragalus and Oxytropis that grow in their fields.
They become lonesome, start walking funny, and bump into things. Eventually, they get so high they will take huge leaps over the smallest obstacles, such as a stick.
Dolphins get high on pufferfish
Some dolphins are also prone to a bit of recreational drug use.
Pufferfish is toxic, but in small doses the neurotoxin they release seems to have a narcotic effect. Dolphins have been reported playing with pufferfish and apparently getting high .
This behaviour was captured by the BBC's Spy in the Pod programme. It is the first reported case of "drug use" among bottlenose dolphins.
Dracula ants suck babies' blood
Sucking the blood of another is weird. Sucking the blood of your own offspring is weirder still.
But that's what Dracula ants do. They chew into the bodies of their young and sucking out their haemolymph (the insect equivalent of blood). The process is called "non-destructive cannibalism", and on the surface it seems to run counter to the laws of evolutionary biology. Parents don't normally feed on their own young.
Dracula ants were discovered in 2014, living in a rotting log in Madagascar. Their young, by the way, don't end up dead: just full of holes.
Animals with multi-functional anuses
One species of sea cucumber, Parastichopus tremulus, has a wonderfully multifunctional anus. Not only does it defecate through its anal opening, it breathes through it too.
Sea cucumbers also use their bottoms for defense. When challenged by a fish or crab, they will face away from their attacker and contract their muscles, ripping their guts apart and widening their anus. They then expel some of their guts, leaving them dangling outside of their body. Some species even expel their respiratory organs through their anuses.
This isn't for show. Sea cucumbers can actually wrap the attacker up in a bundle of their innards, allowing them to crawl away safely. They regrow their insides later.
Penguins' projectile poo
While we're on the subject of anuses, penguins have a special power. No, not the ability to endure months of freezing Antarctic conditions, nor their talent for swimming underwater, or the secret technique they use to get airborne. Penguins are prime pooers.
In 2003, scientists showed that penguins poo with between five and ten times the force a human does, a discovery that won an Ig Nobel award.
They do it to avoid soiling their nests. This way they can shoot their poo out over the side, without bothering to move.
Turtles' dirty mouths
And if that excretory effort isn't enough, Chinese soft-shelled turtles wee through their mouths. When one of these turtles needs to urinate, it goes in search of a puddle, and dunks its head under the surface.
It then pees, passing urea across tiny, finger-shaped protrusions within its mouth.
These structures are usually used for breathing underwater, helping to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. But the turtles have co-opted them to pass urea. Their toilet habits appear to be unique.
Male scorpionflies have anal horns
Courtship can be a long and arduous process for scorpionflies. These insects get their name from the scorpion-like stinger they have on the tips of their abdomens.
But in one genus, Dicerapanorpa, the males have "anal horns". These help them to grasp a female's abdomen during copulation.
A male can lock a female into their embrace for over two hours using their anal horns.
Bats can use sound to sabotage rivals' senses
High up in the sky, Mexican free-tailed bats are waging a war of sound.
These bats can swoop in and steal the prey of competitors by jamming their senses with sound.
Researchers recorded the jamming signals that were emitted and discovered that bats were jammed the very moment they were about to catch a tasty moth. The jamming sound then caused them to miss their prey.
Extraterrestrial bonus entry: On the Moon, humans could walk on water
Humans clearly cannot walk on water on Earth, but we might be able to do so elsewhere.
While some species of insect and lizard can walk on water, humans are far too heavy and slow.
Not so on the Moon, it turns out. The weak lunar gravity means that walking would require less muscle power, and our small feet wouldn't need to move all that fast to avoid sinking.
This research may sound pointless, but these findings could help build "biologically inspired" robots.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Forget the chunk of asphalt. It now looks like a falling log may have been the culprit in the death last October of Jasper, the Tasmanian devil, at the BioPark Zoo.
Although the official manner of Jasper's death remains “undetermined,” an independent investigation summary released Thursday says the more plausible scenario involves a log that slipped off another log inside the animal's enclosure, then struck poor Jasper on the noggin.
ADVERTISEMENTSkip
A chunk of asphalt found in the enclosure originally triggered speculation that someone standing outside the exhibit threw it at Jasper and hit them on the head. That is now looking unlikely, although zoo officials already have said that the cause of death was trauma to the head.
Investigators said that “since asphalt pieces are contained in the fill dirt area that gets placed in some of the animal exhibit yards,” the asphalt could have been in the enclosure long before Jasper died.
Further, the chunk of asphalt was found “at a distance from the devil's body, which would not be the most likely resting place” if it had been thrown at and struck him.
Based on interviews with zoo employees, investigators re-created the “crime scene” and propped up a log against a second log. As pressure was applied, the upper log rolled off the lower one and came to rest in a position similar to where the log was when Jasper was found dead. Because the log was curved, Jasper, who was found under the log, was not crushed.
The investigation was conducted by Robert Caswell Investigations, a local firm, at the request of the city's Risk Management Division. The city paid just under $9,000 for the probe, said the mayor's chief of staff Gilbert Montaño.
Although the investigation found that Jasper was not the victim of random human violence, it did find that some areas of policy, protocol and security at the zoo were “lacking.” Among them:
Taller fencing should have been installed on the east side of the Tasmanian devil exhibit, which was bounded by posts and ropes a mere 18 inches off the ground, making unauthorized access easy.
That communication between zoo administration and security personnel was inadequate “when an incident, such as an unforeseen death of an animal, occurs.”
There was no written policy or procedure in place specifying the measures to take when a zoo animal unexpectedly dies. Neither was it clear who should secure the exhibit before removal of a dead animal, and who was charged with investigating and writing reports.
The perimeter surveillance system had “holes” that could allow unauthorized personnel to gain access to the zoo, particularly along the eastern side of the property.
Montaño said that regardless of what led to Jasper's death, “the important thing to take away is how do we prevent this from happening again and how do we better protect our animals?”
As a result of Jasper's death and the investigation, the BioPark Zoo has adopted a number of changes, Montaño said. Among them are a stepped-up perimeter and internal security patrols, additional cameras at the Tasmanian devil enclosure and other exhibits, and rebuilding the east wall around the Tasmanian devil exhibit.
The zoo also has adopted new policies on daily animal welfare checks and new protocols that spell out who performs what function and in what sequence when an animal is found dead in an exhibit, they said.
Jasper's death prompted state Rep. Georgene Louis, D-Albuquerque, to introduce House Bill 300, which seeks to protect zoo animals in cruelty laws already on the books. The bill unanimously passed the House and has been sent to the Senate.
It is not the first time a chunk of wood led to the death of a zoo animal. Last August, Bea, a camel at the zoo, died instantly when they were struck by a falling tree limb.
Ghost in the Shell's latest critic: its own viral marketing tool
Ghost in the Shell will hit theaters in just over two weeks, and fans of the original, as well as online observers, are already gearing up for a fight. Paramount recently launched an online campaign to promote the film at IAmMajor.me, allowing anyone to upload photos of themselves and add bold, affirmative statements like “I Am The Best At Nickelrolling.” It was supposed to be some light fun.
It did not go well. Instead, fans took to Twitter to highlight how the film not only whitewashes Motoko Kusanagi, but also how it is also an example of white feminism:
It didn't stop there. Using the #IAmMajor hashtag, users also used the tool to mock other movies and TV shows guilty of whitewashing and using the white savior trope, like Dragonball Evolution, The Last Airbender, and Iron Fist:
Sorry, Paramount. When the fun your viral campaign brings is largely at your expense, then something might just be wrong. Ghost in the Shell debuts on March 31st.
Former President Jimmy Carter announced support for NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden this week, saying that their uncovering of the agency's massive surveillance programs had proven "beneficial."
Speaking at a closed-door event in Atlanta covered by German newspaper Der Spiegel, Carter also criticized the NSA's domestic spying as damaging to the core of the nation's principles.
"America does not have a functioning democracy at this point in time," Carter said, according to a translation by Inquisitr.
No American outlets covered Carter's speech, given at an Atlantic Bridge meeting, which has reportedly led to some skepticism over Der Spiegel's quotes. But Carter's stance would be in line with remarks he's made on Snowden and the issue of civil liberties in the past.
In June, while Snowden was scrambling to send out asylum requests from an airport in Russia, Carter appeared to back the former NSA contractor's efforts to remain out of U.S. custody.
"He's obviously violated the laws of America, for which he's responsible, but I think the invasion of human rights and American privacy has gone too far," they told CNN, saying that nations were within their right to offer asylum to Snowden. "I think that the secrecy that has been surrounding this invasion of privacy has been excessive, so I think that the bringing of it to the public notice has probably been, in the long term, beneficial."
Today we launch Health Check, an ongoing series which injects scientific evidence into popular health discussions. Stay tuned for a new Health Check each Monday afternoon.
Eating more fruits and vegetables is the foundation stone of any healthy diet, with the national dietary guidelines recommending adults eat two pieces of fruit and five to six serves of veggies and legumes a day.
Juices can be a convenient and tasty way to get some of the health benefits of these foods – but how do they compare nutritionally?
The one clear downside from drinking rather than eating fruits and vegetables is the loss of fibre and other nutrients found in the skin and pulp. But juicing is certainly better than not eating them at all.
Unless you are eating the pulp leftover in the juicing machine, the amount of fibre in a glass of juice is tiny – less than half a gram. Compare that to the roughly two to three grams of fibre in every serve of fruit or vegetable that went into making the juice in the first place.
And because there is always some liquid left with the pulp, there is a small loss of around 10% of the vitamins and minerals that were in the whole food to start with.
Will Power Studios
Fruits and vegetables also contain lots of natural plant pigments called flavonoids, which have been linked to many health benefits such as cancer prevention and reducing the risk of heart disease. Flavonoids can be found in the skin and pulp of fruit and vegetables, so juicing means that some of these will be lost as well.
In the case of citruses, the whole fruit can contain five times as many flavonoids as an equivalent glass of orange juice.
One other potential downside is that juice is not as filling as eating solid food. And it's easier to drink the equivalent of many pieces of fruit in a few seconds when eating the same amount would take a lot longer, meaning there is more chance of over-consuming unneeded kilojoules.
To see if juices can lead to differences in appetite and later food consumption compared to solid food, 34 healthy lean and overweight people took part in a 21-week study. At different stages of the study, each person consumed a similar amount of fruits and vegetables (1680 kJ in total) daily in either solid (raw) form or as juices. No other changes to the participants' diets were made.
When tested in a food laboratory, people who were overweight reported being significantly hungrier after a standard meal when consuming the juice in the lead up to it, compared to when they ate whole fruit. The post-meal hunger feelings of people of a healthy body weight where unaffected by the form of the fruit they consumed.
Having fruit in either solid or juice form before a meal though did mean less of the following meal was eaten, which is to be expected.
Where it gets interesting, though, is that the people who ate solid fruit before the test meal ate significantly less food than those who drank the juice. Looking at how much food was eaten over the entire day, people who were obese ate significantly more food overall when they were drinking juice compared to eating solid fruit.
Will Merydith
So, while the overall effects of juice compared to solid foods on feelings of hunger and fullness were small over all, the key aspect was this was magnified in people who were overweight.
Eating whole fruits and vegetables helps keep appetite in check by making you feel full. These same foods are also nutrient powerhouses, and on a weight-by-weight comparison, have much fewer kilojoules per gram than most other foods commonly eaten.
It's no surprise that people who eat lots of fruit and vegetables are more likely to have a healthy body weight.
For someone who is battling to keep their weight in check, then two simple positive changes to make are to eat more fruit and vegetables, and to eat them from a plate, not a glass.
Jay Clayton, Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission REUTERS/Brendan McDermid
Jay Clayton, the chairperson of the US Securities and Exchange Committee, weighed in on the crypto-mania sweeping Wall Street in a statement Monday.
"The world's social media platforms and financial markets are abuzz about cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings," Clayton said. "There are tales of fortunes made and dreamed to be made."
The market for cryptocurrencies has reached new heights in 2017, with bitcoin appreciating over $1,500% and gaining its own futures market. Initial coin offerings, a cryptocurrency-based twist on the initial public offering fundraising process, have raised more than $3 billion by some estimates. And Wall Street and Main Street are in a frenzy.
But Clayton wants investors to take off the rose-tinted glasses and approach the highly unregulated space with great caution. They emphasized that not a single initial coin offering has registered with the SEC. Here's Clayton (emphasis their own):
"Investors should understand that to date no initial coin offerings have been registered with the SEC. The SEC also has not to date approved for listing and trading any exchange-traded products (such as ETFs) holding cryptocurrencies or other assets related to cryptocurrencies. If any person today tells you otherwise, be especially wary."
Many companies have shied away from the ICO designation, opting instead for "utility ICO" or "token generation event" as to distance themselves from the regulated world of securities. Clayton said games with semantics won't fly with the SEC.
"Many of these assertions appear to elevate form over substance," they said. "Merely calling a token a "utility" token or structuring it to provide some utility does not prevent the token from being a security."
The international nature of cryptocurrencies can also pose a threat to investors, Clayton said:
"Please also recognize that these markets span national borders and that significant trading may occur on systems and platforms outside the United States. Your invested funds may quickly travel overseas without your knowledge. As a result, risks can be amplified, including the risk that market regulators, such as the SEC, may not be able to effectively pursue bad actors or recover funds."
Still, Clayton recognizes the revolutionary potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.
"The technology on which cryptocurrencies and ICOs are based may prove to be disruptive, transformative and efficiency enhancing," they said. "I am confident that developments in fintech will help facilitate capital formation and provide promising investment opportunities for institutional and Main Street investors alike."
Insomniac Events founder Pasquale Rotella dialed in Bassnectar to Night Owl Radio as the show's "Up All Night" guest for its latest episode (skip to the 38-minute mark). Rotella jumped right into discussion about Bassnectar's first-ever festival residency at Electric Forest, the multi-genre festival in Michigan.
Bassnectar says they considered the opportunity to be "really inspiring." “After last year, you [Rotella] asked if I would come in as an official resident, just to play each year, and I haven't really done that officially for any festival yet, but I just kind of felt like there was nowhere else that felt like home for that."
Electric Forest has quickly become a bucket-lister for many music lovers, having sold out the past three years in record time. Bassnectar mentions that their decision to become a resident at the festival is "partly due to the people that attend, but also just the heart and soul that's put into that event." Fans of the bass headliner can hear four tracks off their forthcoming Unlimited EP here, along with several records from the project in the mix below.
The four-day spectacle, organized by Insomniac Events and Madison House Presents, takes place later this month from June 23-26.
KILLER MIKE: My opinion on the Confederate flag is quite simple and clear. I have no problem with Southerners who consider that a part of their heritage flying it privately in their homes or [wearing it] on their shirts or jackets. Even if that's your choice of vanity license plate, you pay a tax for your license plate in Georgia. So that's your tax, for your license plate. I have white friends who have the Confederate flag on their license plates and I have no issue with that, if they see that as a matter of heritage. But I do not think it should ever fly over a state, city, county building, or school, for the simple reason that it represents secession from the Union. It represented a part of the country trying to become a separate country from America. That side lost, and you do not fly the flags of losers over the winners' country. It's just that simple. There's no way around that.
An army took on the Union, an army lost. That nation, the Confederate states, lost. And if that flag—in terms of publicly or state-sponsored things, or local or county or city-sponsored things—should be forever wiped from the memory, because that side lost. If your great great grandfather participated on the Confederate side and you hold some sentimental value to that, and you want to fly the flag and hang their picture up in your home, that's fine. But it should not be on anything that taxpayers pay for, because taxpayers are a part of the Union not the Confederacy. It has no place in the building, no place on the building, no place around the building.
I remember going downtown [in Atlanta] to the State Capitol and protesting [the old Georgia flag, which incorporated the Confederate flag]. It came down [in 2001] under Governor Roy Barnes, one of our last Democratic governors. It was a very heated debate for a very long time. With that said, there are tons of Confederate flags in Georgia. Many of my neighbors have them. As a Southerner, I understand how it represents our heritage and lives lost in that war. I'll give you that at the negotiation table. But my firm stance is that any group of traitors, anyone who tried to break up this country, deserves no honor once they've lost.
Did the people who lost that war profit from slavery? Yes! Has that symbol been used by stupid, dumb redneck racists? Yes. Has it been used by neo-Nazis? Yes. Has it been used as a way to intimidate black people? Yes, absolutely. As a child, the Confederate flag was explained to me as a flag of racism, that there are often men who will use that flag to try to terrorize black people. My grandparents both were unafraid. My grandmother had been a part of the civil rights movement. They had grown up with their family in Alabama, in Tuskegee. They were always protected and sheltered. My father was a gun owner and protected their home as need be. I've never been afraid of that flag. I've never been afraid of white supremacists. I have been in situations where I knew I was around overt racism—I talked to them respectfully and we did our business and they talked to me respectfully back—but I have never walked around in fear, nor will I.
Dylann Roof certainly thinks [the Confederate flag] is racial, and there are people who are proponents for it because it's racial. But I don't give a damn if they wore it on their jacket. Why should I? That's their jacket. They have the right to wear the Confederate flag, the Rhodesian flag, or any other flag. What I care about is an environment where states like South Carolina will allow that flag to fly above their state building and they know that flag is used as a symbol of empowerment for white supremacy. I care that it's allowed to enforce a sick and perverse mentality by hanging atop a state building that taxpayers pay for. My primary objection to it is firmly grounded in a political argument, not an emotional one. It's less to do about me—"Hey, I'm black and it hurts my feelings, it's a symbol of slavery and oppression"—and more to do with the fact that, as an American, I will not honor a group of treacherous traitors. That's why I despise the rebel flag. Long live the South, and quickly die the Confederacy.
A terroristic act has been committed on Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church before, and has been committed on the black church for the last 400 years. We're familiar with these terrorists: they're called the Ku Klux Klan, and they've been called white supremacists. In this case they are trying to scapegoat it and call it a misguided young man. But in this case, [Roof is] a terrorist.  They are a product of a terrorist propaganda that represents a caste system that hides itself behind race in this country. I see that mentality of terror as something that needs to be fought. There is no hope and no redemption for this young man. I have no forgiveness in my heart for him, and my hope is that they spend the rest of their life in prison or is quickly put to death behind the great and heinous act they did. There's no sympathy in my heart for him.
As a person who is a part of a minority group that has been terrorized, I feel like that minority group should seek every way possible to end that terror upon themselves. I feel like that terror is state sanctioned and that this minority group should deal with the state in terms of the voting booth. In the core of me I feel like, economically, there are corporations that have backed politicians that have kept the Confederate flag high and that have allowed the premise of white supremacy to stand. I think that [people] should attack those corporations economically by withholding money from them.

A medieval house in the Black Mountains has been saved from complete collapse thanks to generous donations.
The house named Llwyn Celyn, which means Hollybush in English, is being restored by The Landmark Trust charity and featured on the Channel 4 show Restoring Britain's Landmarks.
The Grade I listed house in the Brecon Beacons, near Abergavenny needed £4.2 million for its restoration but the trust appealed for the remaining £47,000 in November .
Now they have secured the vital funds needed for the project and work is set to begin in April.
Llwyn Celyn was acquired with joint grants from Cadw and the National Heritage Memorial Fund further pledges of support included a grant of £100,000 from Country Houses Foundation and an anonymous Guardian of Llwyn Celyn pledged £187k. The remaining funding came from the Pilgrim Trust, CHK Charities, and generous individuals.
Conservationists say Llwyn Celyn is one of the most remarkable surviving medieval houses in Britain.
It was one of the longest continuously occupied homes in Britain after being lived in since 1480. The last occupants moved out in early 2014.
It had become so run down that it was being held up by scaffolding.
Among the outbuildings the trust has identified a rare surviving cider house, a grain drying kiln and a little malt kiln, used for roasting barley to make malt for beer making. They say “it seems clear there will be more discoveries to come.”

Restoring Britain's Landmarks goes behind the scenes at remarkable restoration projects and discovers the history behind them and Llwyn Celyn is featured in episode two.
The show is presented by experts from The Landmark Trust – Director Dr Anna Keay, Conservation Manager Alastair Dick-Cleland and Furnishings Manager John Evetts.
How the house will be used
The Landmark Trust purchase and update historic buildings to rent out as holiday lets, so people can “holiday in history”.
When it is completed the house will sleep eight in the main house, so that people can experience Llwyn Celyn for holidays and short breaks. The surrounding historic barns will be adapted for use by the local community, including an information room.
Extensive repairs and sensitive alterations will be carried out by expert craftsmen and the entire project will provide training for apprentices and others in traditional building skills.

How many people from Western countries would believe that there is actually a sizeable and growing area in the Middle East in which democracy, freedom of religion and equality of men and women are simple facts of life? An area in which Kurds, Syriac Christians and Arabs work together? I am here to tell you that I've been to such a region myself and seen it first-hand. And I am not the only one. The embattled people of these new regions need Christians and others of good will who live in the West to understand and support this fragile but hopeful new start for the battered peoples of Syria and neighboring countries.
If there is hope for peaceful coexistence, religious diversity and the rights of women and ethnic minorities anywhere in the Middle East, it is in the regions of Syria controlled by indigenous militia groups which have been fighting for years, with only fitful help from the West, to establish what they see as the best possible future: a decentralized country where local people have maximum control over their own fates, instead of being the pawns of foreign powers or the victims of murderous governments.
Unfortunately, no representatives of this free, democratic region were invited to the UN peace talks in Geneva, which may determine the fate of all the groups in the region.
These militias have fought courageously and with real success; now they are excluded from the peace talks in Geneva which should determine the end-game in the Syrian civil war. American Christians should let their elected representatives know that people of faith will not be satisfied with any outcome that robs such self-governing regions, and religious minorities, of their hard-won liberty.
The map below is crucial to understanding what is going on in Syria. Things are very different in West and South Syria on the one hand, and North and East Syria on the other.
In North and East Syria there are two main factions that fight each other: the terrorist Islamists of ISIS are battling a coalition of Kurds, Arabs and Aramaic-speaking Christians. This anti-ISIS coalition is also known as the Democratic Self-Administration (DSA). In Kurdish this area is called ‘Rojava' and in Aramaic “Gozarto.” Much of the war against ISIS in Syria is actually a war between these two quasi-state entities: the ISIS theocracy, and the multi-religious, self-governing DSA.
The DSA is divided into three cantons: Afrin in the uttermost northwest of Syria, Kobane in the north central region, and Jazire in the northeast. Each of these cantons has its own parliament, and is turn governed by elected local councils. (In Jazire, for example, local elections took place in March 2015.) The parliaments and regional governments reflect the ethno-religious diversity of the areas they govern.
The best example is Canton Jazire in which all governmental posts and departments are divided between Arabs, Kurds and Syriac Christians. Furthermore 40 percent of political positions in each canton is held by women. When I was visiting the Jazire, I had the honor to spend down a whole evening with the Syriac-Assyrian Christian ministers and state secretaries of that canton, many of them women. (Remember that across the border, in ISIS territory, such non-Muslim women are not part of government — they are kidnapped and sold as sex slaves.)
A Tolerant Democratic Government with Equal Rights for Women
The DSA government is secular and tolerant, governed by a Social Contract that functions as a kind of constitution. The DSA's Social Contract rejects Islamism and dictatorship, and guarantees political representation for women. A network of “women's houses” and female-led organizations supports this move to offer equal rights for all. Syriac Christians have their own cultural, civic political and media organizations, whose members I was privileged to meet on one of my visits to DSA's region of Syria.
As the DSA is in an ongoing war against ISIS, members of the ethnic and religious groups living there join in the fight — including the mostly Kurdish YPG, the Christian-led Syriac Military Council, and smaller Arab militias (the Jaish al Thuwwar, Burkan-Al Firat and Sanadid forces). In late 2015, the DSA linked these smaller militias into the umbrella group called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which has begun to receive support and airpower protection from the United States. The U.S. now treats the SDF as a formal American ally in the fight against ISIS.
I had the honor of visiting several headquarters of the militias making up the SDF, and meeting the brave soldiers who are defending their freedom. Since 2015, the SDF forces have beaten ISIS consistently, driving the terrorists into retreat. As a consequence ISIS is facing the possibility of an overall defeat in Syria, its main power base. If that happens, ISIS likely also will be defeated in Iraq — freeing many more religious minorities from its savage regime of repression, and diminishing ISIS's resources for attacks against the West.
The “Moderates”
The next threat the democratic, tolerant government of the SDF faces comes from groups who are routinely depicted in the West as “moderate” rebels against the Syrian government, including groups that have received U.S. aid in the past. In cold, hard fact, the “moderate” elements among these rebels were marginalized many months ago, and they are dominated by Islamists such as al Nusra, which is formally allied with al Qaeda. These theocrats, who are not much more tolerant of religious minorities than ISIS is, seized the weapons and money the Americans had intended for supposed moderate militias.
The latest development in this fight is a political declaration on the part of the DSA. On March 17, 2016, the DSA renamed itself the “Federation of Rojava North Syria.” This Federation is a formal governing structure for areas liberated from ISIS, but not controlled by Assad or any Islamist militia. Unfortunately, no representatives of this free, democratic region were invited to the UN peace talks in Geneva, which may determine the fate of all the groups in the region — including the four million people who now live in freedom and safety as part of the DSA's Federation. Observers trace the exclusion of this large group to pressure from Turkey, which resents and fears any sign of independence on the part of Kurdish peoples in the region.
A number of the Syriac-Assyrian Christians live in areas inside the DSA that are still under control of the Assad regime (they are in the ‘red dots' inside the ‘Rojava' area as seen in the map). These Christians have a militia of their own, the Gozarto Protection Forces/Sootoro, which receives support from the regime.
The DSA: Disproving the Syrian Stereotype
There is hope for the people of Syria in the experience of the DSA and its Federation, which give the lie to the notion that Middle Eastern peoples are incapable of peaceful coexistence, religious tolerance or democratic self-governance. Thanks to a twist of fate, and the near collapse of the central government in Syria, the people of this region — Muslim and Christian, Arab, Kurd and Syriac — have been given a chance to prove that this stereotype is false.
Under siege from the fanatics of ISIS, ignored by most of the world, these freedom fighters deserve the West's support at the negotiating table. This is especially crucial since the major powers in the region, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, are violently opposed to the autonomy of Kurdish and Christian communities. They want to subject these communities to rule by the Islamist militias whom they sponsor.
Westerners concerned about defending religious freedom and fighting terrorism owe the DSA Federation their support. Christians like us who are privileged to enjoy religious freedom must not abandon the embattled Christians and other minorities who have won themselves a respite from persecution and dictatorship. Those who wish to learn more can also contact my own group, the Christian Political Foundation for Europe , which is connected with the European Parliament of the EU.
The free peoples of Syria don't ask the West to step in and “fix” things for them. They only ask for support in defending the freedom they have already won for themselves. If they succeed, millions more across the region will be inspired by their example.
Russia's meteorological service said on Tuesday it had measured pollution of a radioactive isotope at nearly 1,000 times normal levels in the Ural mountains, the first official Russian data supporting reports that an accident had taken place.
The data appears to support a report by the French nuclear safety institute IRSN, which said on Nov. 9 a cloud of radioactive pollution over Europe had indicated that an accident had taken place at a nuclear facility either in Russia or Kazakhstan in the last week of September.
Neither Russia nor Kazakhstan has acknowledged any accident.
Russian state weather service Roshydromet said in a statement it had found "extremely high pollution" of ruthenium 106 in samples from two meteorological stations in the southern Ural mountains region in late September and early October.
At the Agrayash weather station the levels were 986 times those of the previous month, while at the Novogorny station they were 440 times higher. The weather service did not rule out that the radioactive isotope could be absorbed into the atmosphere and reach Europe.
Russian firm says it's not to blame
The Agrayash weather station is located about 30 kilometres from Mayak, a huge plant that reprocesses nuclear fuel and produces radioactive material for industrial and research purposes, owned by Russian state nuclear company Rosatom. Mayak accounts for half of Russian exports of radioactive isotopes.

In a statement, Mayak denied that its plant was the source of increased level of ruthenium 106. Rosatom was also quoted by Russia's RIA news agency as saying there were no accidents at any of its facilities which could increase the level of ruthenium 106 in the atmosphere.
Greenpeace said in a statement on Tuesday that it would ask Russia's prosecutors' office to investigate whether there had been an accident in the area.
"It also demands a check into whether the atmospheric radionuclide monitoring system is sufficiently prepared for possible accidents, and whether public health around a possible release of Ruthenium 106 was sufficiently protected," the environmental group said in a statement.
France's IRSN ruled out the possibility of an accident in a nuclear reactor, saying the material it detected was more likely to have been released from a nuclear fuel treatment site or centre for radioactive medicine.
The pollution would not be sufficient to cause an impact on human health or the environment in Europe, the French institute said.
The Institute of Nuclear Physics in Kazakhstan, which neighbours the southern Urals, has said there were no accidents at its scientific research reactor and no ruthenium 106 at its two disused testing areas in western Kazakhstan.
Venture Capitalist Fred Wilson is a self-proclaimed bitcoin believer, but when speaking at New York University recently they highlighted some of the negative aspects of the digital currency, which they said, are holding it back from widespread adoption.
Currently, security, practicality and problems related to speculation and hoarding are the biggest issues facing bitcoin, they said at an event sponsored by the NYC Foundation for Computer Science Education.
Wilson is the co-founder of venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, which has made investments in a number of successful tech start-ups, including Twitter, Tumblr, Kickstarter and Zynga. The company also has a focus on bitcoin, investing in digital currency startups rather than the currency itself.
As a proponent of digital currencies, Wilson attended the New York State bitcoin hearings in January, and has previously said the block chain could be an even bigger opportunity than bitcoin.
In their NYU speech, Wilson said:
“What bitcoin does is remove the need for that central entity, that central computer and central company. The way I like to think about bitcoin is like PayPal, but open source, peer-to-peer and not controlled by a company.”
The problem with hoarding
Wilson said that rampant speculation, bitcoin hoarding and price volatility go hand in hand, arguing that most people still decide to sit on bitcoin, effectively hoarding it and waiting for the price to go up. Such behaviour causes supply problems, affecting volume and price in the process.
Wilson explained:
“I also think we need to see real transaction volume happen. Right now, most people who get bitcoin hold it, they don't transact with it. That's part of what causes all of the volatility — if there was a very vibrant system where bitcoin was just getting swapped around like crazy, the velocity of the money would cause bitcoin's price to stabilize and there would be a much more liquid market. I think those are the kinds of things an economist would want to see.”
Another problem that keeps volumes low, they said, is the fact that buying bitcoin is not as straightforward as it seems. Wilson indicated that it can take days for bitcoin to show up in their account once they buy some. This simply is not practical if you want to use the cryptocurrency on a day-to-day basis.
Improved security essential
Wilson further identified a lack of security as a major challenge facing bitcoin, and one that is hampering mainstream adoption.
They argued that it is still relatively easy to hack into people's computers, and thus into bitcoin wallets hosted there, while bad actors running bitcoin businesses pose a threat to public confidence in the digital currency:
“Bitcoin theft is a big issue. Bitcoin fraud is a big issue. And what will have to happen is we will need to see companies like Coinbase and others merge that can invest heavily in security. And that's both technological security, and also process security, to make you comfortable to keep your bitcoin there. And I think that that's probably going to be first big commercial opportunity in bitcoin, […] to create secure systems. Because without that, I don't think we'll ever get enough confidence and trust in the system for people to really start using it.”
More potential than teething problems
Wilson did not simply address concerns and challenges, they also talked about bitcoin's unique properties that make it an attractive payment option for merchants, charities and other organisations.
“The thing that's cool about bitcoin is that it is like cash on a wire, or cash over the air. It's like I'm giving you a five dollar bill, but it comes into your account over the Internet and there is nobody to pay for the transaction. That is a big deal,” they said.
Wilson pointed out that crowdfunding platforms, charities and many businesses rely on relatively small individual transactions. The fees pile up quickly and allowing a charity or a crowdfunded project to keep 2-5% of the cash they raise in their pocket makes a big difference.
“All of that money is going to go to the cause we care about. None of that is going to go to a third party that is making money off of the charity,” they added.
Some of Wilson's assertions have been met with vocal criticism from the bitcoin community on reddit and other online forums. In response they took to reddit on Sunday to clarify their position on these and other concerns.
Introduction
The CalendarDatePicker acts like the regular DatePicker from Windows 8.1 but with a design of a calendar month. The default styles fits directly in with other control default styles and supports both light and dark theme and of course the platforms Windows and Windows Phone.
Here are a few images to give you an idea of what the control looks like.
In this post, I will explain how to use the control and its features. The source code for this control is of course available you will find a link at the bottom of this post.
Properties
The CalendarDatePicker inherits from ItemsControl beside the properties from the ItemsControl I have added some additional ones.
SelectedDate
The date selected on the CalendarDatePicker. Does of course support two-way bindings so it will change the date should it change on the data bound item. This value updates immediately when a user clicks a date. The default value is DateTime.Now.
<controls:CalendarDatePicker SelectedDate="{Binding SelectedDate, Mode=TwoWay}" />
FirstDayOfWeek
The first day of the week. Supporting only Sunday and Monday would properly be sufficient however, the control supports all days. The default value depends on the value set in the current culture info but can be set manually or even bound.
<controls:CalendarDatePicker FirstDayOfWeek="Monday" />
WeekDaysCharLenght
The number of characters shown in weekdays and supports the values 1-3.
1: will show Mondays as M. 2: Mo and 3: Mon.
Note that the base style does not support 3. There is no room for a third character therefor the control will be cropping some of the text. If you want a third character you will have to restyle the control otherwise stick with the values 1 and 2. The default value is 2.
<controls:CalendarDatePicker WeekDaysCharLenght="1" />
DisplayWeekDays
Whether or not weekdays should be shown above the actual dates. Since WeekDaysCharLenght does not support the value 0 this is the way to hide it. The default value is true.
<controls:CalendarDatePicker DisplayWeekDays="False" />
CalendarDatePicker
The demo project contains the source code for the CalendarDatePicker and an example of custom styling.
When creating custom styles for the CalenderDatePicker there a few things worth noting.
The CalendarDatePicker is a modified ItemsControl. It is very depended on the panel placing its items. By default, it is a WrapGrid with max columns of 7. You should properly not change this.
The CalendarDatePickerItem is the selectable dates. It contains visual states to control its appearance. This is based on a radio button. So use the checked states to style the date when selected. I have created some additional state. IsToday/NotToday for highlighting todays date which is based on DateTime.Now. IsInCurrentMonth/ NotInCurrentMonth to style when a date is within the current displayed month.
The CalendarDatePickerWeekDayItem is the weekdays. This is based on a Control with a WeekDay string witch is set by the CalendarDatePicker class. Both CalendarDatePickerItem and CalendarDatePickerWeekDayItem are items within the items control.
If you have, any questions regarding this feel free to leave a comment.

In very worrisome news Tuesday, the Haitian Health Ministry estimated that the cholera outbreak in Haiti is resulting in an average of 32 deaths every 24 hours since the epidemic began on October 20. The Ministère de la Sante Publique et de la Population de Haïti (MSPP) reported 73 hospitalized cases due to cholera in Port-au-Prince in the neighborhoods of Carrefour, Cite Soleil, Delmas, Kenscoff, Petion Ville, Port-au-Prince, and Tabarre.
Out of 9,123 cases, 583 have died. That is a death rate of 1 death for every 16 people infected. Put another way, the death rate is 6 percent. World Health Organization figures for 2008 are total of 190,130 cases from 56 countries, including 5143 deaths, or one death per 36 infections, or 3 percent. Why is the death rate for Haiti so much higher when the epidemic is just beginning?
That is the math. When we arrived in Haiti on Saturday, Hurricane Tomas had come and gone, injuring 36 people; leaving 11 missing and 20 dead, according to the latest estimates by Haitian authorities. But Tomas left another legacy in the valleys below the central plateau. The Artibonite River overflowed its banks, flooding rice and cornfields; spreading the cholera bacterium like dandelion seeds in the wind. You can follow the timeline at the Pan American Health Organization website on an interactive map.
Every reasonable analysis indicates that the source of the cholera outbreak in Haiti is the Nepalese Annapurna United Nations camp near Mirebalais. The World Health Organization has said that it is not important that we worry about the source of the cholera.
The Haitian people feel differently.
Immediately after we deplaned in Port-Au-Prince, we met with Lavarice Gaudin, a well-known leader of the Haitian Diaspora. Gaudin urged us to travel to Mirebalais to meet with locals and investigate how the Nepalese were allegedly engaged in a cover-up of the faulty septic system that introduced cholera into the Meye River, one of the tributaries of the Artibonite River. The Artibonite flows through fertile farmlands and Gaudin insisted that Haitians need reparation for lives lost and crops that are now tainted.
“You cannot put a monetary value on a human life,” Gaudin said, but how can farmers cope with the added tragedy of ruined crops of rice, corn, vegetables and beans?”
Gaudin offered the observation that the “UN has done nothing for Haiti. They have not provided electricity, hospitals, schools or clean water,” they said. “The UN has spent up to $50.6 million per month in Haiti. For what?”
We checked those figures, and they turned out be a conservative estimate. The UN mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) had nearly $60 million approved for July 2009 to June 21010. This included “an increase in the Mission's troop and police levels — to 8,940 and 3,711, respectively — to support immediate recovery, reconstruction and stability efforts.”
So, we went to Mirebalais to see the UN Annapurna base for ourselves, and through the assistance of Gaudin and the Haitian Lawyers Leadership Network (HLLN), we were able to contact leaders in the Mirebalais community. It is important that Haitians provide testimony that is not filtered through the eyes of the international donor community, the politically correct pronunciations of the Centers for Disease Control, WHO, NGOs, and the Haitian government. Cholera is new to Haiti and tests on this strain showed that it had to originate in either South or South East Asia. The UN is in full denial mode that the Annapurna base was ground zero.
The Nepalese troops were not tested for cholera before their deployment if they did not present symptoms. But health officials say 75 percent of people infected with cholera bacteria do not show symptoms and can still pass on the disease for weeks.
Feeder bands from Tomas left a fine mist of rain and fog as we navigated the mountain and valley roads. The streets of Mirebalais were wet and muddy, and mud squished over our shoes as we gingerly stepped out of our jeep to talk to the local police–the PNH. Once again, the conversation was very critical regarding the Nepalese UN soldiers.
“They change guard every three hours and stand at the gate, doing nothing. When we go on a mission with them, we cannot count on them. Communication is a big problem. They don't speak Creole or French. They can't communicate with us and they can't communicate with the people.”
We had previously learned that there were 100 confirmed cases of cholera and five deaths at the local jail early in the epidemic. Could the PNH officer direct us to the jail? They pointed at the building behind us. We were standing in front of the gate. Suddenly the mud soaking up our pants' legs became an issue.
One phone call and one container of hand sanitizer later, three members of the Collectif des Etudiants Mirebalais (CEH) joined us. The plan was to take us to the source of the contagion—outlet pipes from the drain field at the Anapurna camp that emptied directly into the Meye River. The students told us that shortly after the Center for Disease Control tests indicated the south Asia connection, the Nepalese reconfigured the drain field and put razor wire around the openings. This was definitely something we should document.
The students gave us permission to use photos of them, but since they were involved in organizing a demonstration on October 29, they did not want their names made public.
The Nepalese Annapurna camp is a short distance from the center of Mirebalais. The walls of the compound form a perimeter that does not include the river, and it would be quite easy to simply walk on Haitian soil to the drain field outlet. So, assured we were not on UN grounds, we began to walk, but the students held back. At first we did not understand why, but it soon became obvious. Suddenly, there was loud shouting and waving coming from the guard turrets. It was obvious the guards within the compound did not want us walking there. Rather than press the issue, we thought it would show good faith to simply make our way around to the front gate, explain that I was an American journalist, we were on Haitian soil, and wanted to walk to riverbank to examine the alleged source of the cholera.
Readers can guess what happened next. After a pleasant conversation inside the compound with a Nepalese in civilian clothes, using a combination of French, English, Creole and Nepali, it was obvious that it did not make any difference whether we were Haitian, American, or from Andromeda—there would be no access unless we wanted to cross the rain-swollen, cholera contaminated river and view the source from a very long distance away. Our translator made an impassioned argument that the United Nations could not keep Haitians from walking on Haitian soil, but it made no impact.
We regrouped and figured we should just proceed, since there was nothing the Nepalese soldiers could do legally to stop us. We were wrong. I offered to go first, relying on the almighty American passport. Nepalese soldiers in civilian clothes repeatedly blocked our path, and I repeatedly and politely stepped around them. This went of for several minutes as the shouting grew louder and louder from the turrets culminating in agitated conversations on hand-held radios. At that point, I reconsidered, figuring the UN soldiers could not arrest me, but a sympathetic local police might consider doing just that. There was no way to know for sure, so I backed off.
My Haitian translator once again argued vehemently, demanded to know what right the Nepalese soldiers had to keep us off Haitian soil that was clearly not within their perimeter.
The students wanted to try crossing the river, but it was too deep for the Jeep and even though they students were piling stones for us to use as a bridge, the thought of what was in the water told me to say “no.”
The first question that arises is why would the Nepalese refuse access on public property if they had nothing to hide? We asked for the test results they conducted with an independent lab in the Dominican Republic. The answer was “no,” but the Nepalese we originally spoke with said the “tests were negative.”
Why hide a negative result?
The tests were allegedly conducted on an underground waste container and tthis has been reported by Jonathan Katz of the Associated Press, but not analyzed in mainstream media.
No one knows brand and type of method used to test the Nepalese septic tanks. There is a huge variation in the sensitivity of various tests. Was it one of many available rapid tests or a routine old-fashioned culture method? Rapid tests consistently detect cholera at between 2000 colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter (ml) to up to 20,000,000 CFU per ml (the least sensitive test). A CFU means one live bacterium capable of reproduction.
In order to become ill from cholera, one needs to ingest between 1000 and 1,000,000 organisms (100-10,000 if ingested with food). Therefore, if one drinks one cup (500 ml) of contaminated water, along with food, that cup of water only needs 2 bacteria per ml to cause infection.
That is .0000001 the concentration needed to be consistently detected by the least accurate rapid test. This is the worst-case scenario. More likely, one might ingest just 5 ml (one teaspoon) of contaminated water containing 200,000 CFU /ml, which is guaranteed to cause infection. Even this concentration is only 1 percent of the concentration needed to be consistently detected by the least sensitive rapid test.
The bottom line is that even if the most advanced rapid testing was done in the world's best laboratory, the negative results are meaningless. If a genetic PCR test was used, results might be more reliable.
Read more, here, here, and here.
The UN could clear thus up by releasing information regarding their testing. However, one would suspect that an independent lab in the Dominican Republic would not have the capability of doing PCR testing.
For the World Health organization to ignore this gap in information and say that it is not important to know where the epidemic began is political maneuvering, especially since the Haitian government and the CDC will need the cooperation of the UN to help contain this outbreak, if it can be contained.
Cholera is excreted in the feces and vomit. The contagion can be found in feces for up to 50 days, on glass for up to a month, on coins for a week, in soil or dust for up to 16 days, and on fingertips for 1 to 2 hours
That is the bad news.
The good news is that the local television station in Mirebalais had footage of the October 29 demonstration that includes visuals of the reconfigured septic outlet. The footage is jerky, but you can clearly see clean stones, fresh razor wire, and an unidentifiable bluish-green muck in the river.
I added the title frames and took clips from a 45 minute file.
In this case, a few frames of video are worth more than the thousands of words offered in this article.
Next: Following in the path of Cholera through the Central Valley and discovering why the death rate might be so high.

RICHMOND, Va., April 7, 2014—On Friday, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe signed a bill into law effectively designating outdoor areas on the Commonwealth's public college campuses as public forums, where student speech is subject only to reasonable, content- and viewpoint-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions. Under this new law, college students at Virginia's public universities will not be limited to expressing themselves in tiny “free speech zones” or subject to unreasonable registration requirements.
HB 258, championed by its lead patron Delegate Scott Lingamfelter, passed both houses of the Virginia General Assembly unanimously. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) urged the passage of the bill and testified on behalf of the legislation in hearings in both legislative houses.
“FIRE thanks Governor McAuliffe, Delegate Lingamfelter, and all of Virginia's delegates and senators for coming together and supporting this legislation,” said FIRE Legislative and Policy Director Joe Cohn. “One in six public colleges in the United States unjustly restricts student speech with free speech zones. Thanks to this new law, public institutions in Virginia will no longer be among them.”
Restricting student speech to tiny “free speech zones” diminishes the quality of debate and discussion on campus by preventing expression from reaching its target audience. Often, institutions that maintain these restrictive policies also employ burdensome permitting schemes that require students to obtain administrative permission days or even weeks before being allowed to speak their minds. Even worse, many of these policies grant campus administrators unfettered discretion to deny applications based on the viewpoint or content of the speakers' intended message.
FIRE stands ready to work with Virginia's public colleges and universities to eliminate any and all such restrictions on free speech in order to achieve compliance with the new law. Administrators may contact Azhar Majeed, director of FIRE's Individual Rights Education Program, for free assistance.
FIRE is a nonprofit educational foundation that unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders, scholars, journalists, and public intellectuals from across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of individual rights, due process, freedom of expression, academic freedom, and rights of conscience at our nation's colleges and universities. FIRE's efforts to preserve liberty on campuses across America are described at thefire.org.

Introduction
Many times I thought of a system that will track a sensor reading for specific time and save that data for future analysis after doing the same task for several days. So I made a system using Arduino and the amazing 1sheeld to save LDR readings in an Excel sheet and that is what we are going to do now.

Washington (CNN) – The percentage of Americans 30 and younger who harbor some doubts about God's existence appears to be growing quickly, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. While most young Americans, 68%, told Pew they never doubt God's existence, that's a 15-point drop in just five years.
In 2007, 83% of American millennials said they never doubted God's existence.
More young people are expressing doubts about God now than at any time since Pew started asking the question a decade ago. Thirty-one percent disagreed with the statement “I never doubt the existence of God,” double the number who disagreed with it in 2007.
Atheist organizer takes ‘movement' to nation's capital
When asked about doubts of God, no other generation showed a change of more than 2% in the past five years.
The survey found that the percentage of millennials who identify with a religion is remaining constant, while most other generations have seen religious identification increase in the past 10 years.
The findings about millennials and religion were part of a 168-page report that Pew released June 4 but were largely overlooked.
“Notably, people younger than 30 are substantially less likely than older people to say prayer is an important part of their lives,” the report said.
“Research on generational patterns shows that this is not merely a lifecycle effect,” it continued. “The Millennial generation is far less religious than were other preceding generations when they were the same age years ago.”
Atheist group targets Muslims, Jews with ‘myth' billboards in Arabic and Hebrew
The findings are part of Pew's 2012 American Values Survey, which touches on issues including political partisanship, gay marriage and abortion.
Despite the findings on millennials, the survey shows that the United States continues to be a highly religious nation, with most Americans identifying with a particular faith.
Seventy-six percent of all respondents said prayer is an important part of their lives and agreed that “we all will be called before god at the Judgment Day to answer for our sins.” About 80% said they have never doubted the existence of God.
The report points to a growing divide between the youngest and oldest Americans on belief, religion and social issues.
According to Jesse Galef, communications director for the Secular Student Alliance, the growth in “doubting” youths has led to a surge in secular student groups.
“For a lot of millennial atheists, they are expecting to find a group, they are coming to campus, and if they don't find one, they are starting one,” Galef said. “This is completely different than what other generations grew up with.”
Atheist rally continues in spite of rain; students highlighted throughout
The Secular Student Alliance has affiliates on 357 American campuses, Galef said, up from 81 such affiliates in 2007.
Galef says the Internet has created a place for young people to discuss religious doubts.
“It enables anybody to have open discussions without fearing if their parents would find out or what their communities would say,” they said. "The more safe places we create for young people to discuss their doubts, the more they can inspire questions in others."
Whether it will mark an end to Altaf Hussain's politics or a new beginning for Muttahidda Qaumi Movement (MQM) is premature to say, but a comprehensive legal reference, which the government intends to send to the British government in the next couple of weeks, can make things extremely difficult for Altaf Hussain to continue their politics in Pakistan. So, what they and the party will decide?
The new ‘minus Altaf' formula is different from the past. There will be no defection, no change of loyalties of MNAs or MPAs, but the authorities intend to completely eliminate the party's militant wing and isolate Altaf Hussain.
MQM, as a party, would be allowed to continue but without its ‘tanzeemi committee' (TC), which the authorities believe is controlled by the militants. Thus, TC might not be allowed to function, even if it is not officially announced so.
MQM may also find it difficult to continue with its sectors and units heads particularly those nominated by Hammad Siddiqui or even by Aamir Khan.
But how strong the government intends to come down on Altaf Hussain? Talking to some very senior officials in the Rangers and within the government suggests there is a clear ‘red line' on their future politics or on MQM's alleged militancy. Some 1,000 to 1200 MQM men including heads of sectors and units in Sindh have been marked as ‘militants'.
The legal reference, which interior minister, Ch. Nisar Ali Khan has mentioned, comprisesdozens of criminal cases including Dr. Imran Farooq case and its links with Pakistan. The authorities attach importance to the statement of key suspect, Muzzam Ali, and claim that they have collected important evidence. There are dozens of money laundering inquires also.
Sources well aware of these developments also revealed that DG Rangers, Maj. General, Bilal Akhtar, is likely to go to London soon in this connection. They have recently met the interior minister to discuss the progress in some sensitive cases
particularly those in which Altaf Hussain's direct links were found, which would be essential to establish that despite being a British national, they are allegedly instigating violence here.
Sources said they have also given the list of 56 alleged MQM militants, who received training in India to the minister.
The government does not want to file a weak reference, as it knows how difficult it would be to block their Pakistan's links under the British laws. Therefore, the Rangers have only picked those cases that have strong evidence of the alleged direct involvement of MQM leader.
Altaf Hussain, in their emotional speech on Thursday, during which they almost broke down, talked about the conspiracy to form a new MQM and, at the same time, admitted that party leaders, Rabita Committee members and ex-ministers are leaving him. It was Altaf's counter attack as they knew that things are getting difficult for him. Sensing the pressure on the party leaders, they have already alerted them. So, they have rallied workers around and it is their preemptive measure so that the remaining party leaders would not fall in any trap. So far Altaf Hussain has maintained their grip on the party, though they themselves have hinted at cracks in the party when they said that the people are running away.
But what will they do if they lose the case and gets jailed. Have they decided who will run the show in their absence? This time around they are finding it difficult to find strong leaders to defend them except Dr Frooq Sattar and a few others. Above all, their own speeches have become their biggest problem.
Under the new ‘formula, they might though continue as a symbolic head of the party In the past the revolts were against Altaf; the first led by Afaq and Aamir and the second by former MQM chairperson Azeem Ahmad Tariq. This time, there may not be any revolt but the idea is to isolate him.
Some believe Governor Ishratul Ibad has been tasked by the establishment to contact those party leaders who have not officially left the party but have decided to remain silent and are living in Dubai, USA and in London.
Governor Ibad has succeeded in persuading the establishment not to repeat the events of 92 or 94, or cause a split in the party and has also asked for political rights for Muhajirs.The move under the new formula is simple; cut off all their links and contacts in Pakistan; seek ban on their activities in London particularly their links here as the authorities here are moving fast on Dr. Imran Farooq case but are still undecided about handing over three suspects including the key accused Muzzam Ali to the British government. Some very important details of the case would be part of the reference.
But why disband the Tanzeemi Committee? Some concerned senior officials indicate that in the light of investigations and interrogation of key members of the committee, they are now convinced that this committee was allegedly controlled party militants, which MQM denies. MQM social network, Al-Kidmat Foundation and others may not be allowed to collect hides on Eidul Azha.”
The authorities feel that if they succeed in persuading the British government to proceed against Altaf Hussain in the light of the reference, and if they get convicted in London, the MQM would be left with no other option but to look for a new leader.
So, political temperature in Sindh is going up but at the same time chances of local bodies elections are getting slim. How MQM fares in these elections will decide whether the party can forge ahead without Altaf Hussain.
The authorities here are confident that after filing a strong reference against Altaf Hussain, it would be difficult for the British government to allow them to continue with the alleged violence-linked politics. This, they believe, will provide MQM an opportunity to adopt a different political discourse without discarding Altaf. This is the new ‘minus Altaf' formula and maybe a ‘new' MQM.

Image caption Falling sales and narrowing margins have hurt Sony's television business over the past few years
Sony has reported an annual profit for the first time in five years, boosted by asset sales and a weakening yen.
Net profit was 43bn yen ($436m; £280m) in the year to 31 March, compared with a 457bn loss a year earlier.
Sony said the yen's recent fall, which makes its goods cheaper for foreign buyers, boosted sales. A weak yen also lifts profits when firms repatriate their foreign earnings back home.
But some analysts said gains from asset sales had skewed the latest numbers.
The firm said it expected its profits to rise to 50bn yen in the current financial year, with the yen forecast to remain weak.
The Japanese currency has fallen more than 20% against the US dollar since November last year, after policymakers unveiled a series of aggressive measures aimed at spurring growth in the economy.
Restructuring process
Sony, which was once a market leader in various product categories, has seen its fortunes plummet over the past few years.
Increased competition, falling prices and narrowing profit margins have hurt its business, especially in the TV segment which has been making a loss for the past eight years.
As a result, Sony has been trying to restructure its business model and reduce its costs.
As part of the restructuring process, the firm has sold key assets over the past few months, including its US headquarters in New York and some of its shares in M3, a medical research and marketing firm.
The firm has also offloaded its "Sony City Osaki" building in Tokyo.
Sony said the sale of all these assets had resulted in gains of nearly $2.5bn during the last financial year - and the figure contributed to the rise in its earnings during the period.
Analysts said that given the impact these sales have had on its profit - the numbers were not a true reflection of the firm's success.
Gerhard Fasol of Eurotechnology Japan said that these gains "really need to be subtracted from the results, to understand the regular operating results".
Mr Fasol pointed out that the firm's results indicated that its electronics division continued to struggle and that the unit had not been turned around yet.
A total revolution of all kinds of relationships existing in society has been going on in Rojava for 6 years now, but it is far from being completed – if such a thing as completion is even possible. It is on the contrary at its very beginning. It has to be defended against its enemies, deepened and continuously developed further.
Therefore, internationalists who come to Rojava do not come as tourists to look at a finished work. Rojava is not a museum where the revolution can be examined and measured. Rojava is not a monument of past battles. Rojava is a living and developing organism. And those who approach it as revolutionaries become part of it.
We internationalists in this revolution, which is still in its infancy, came from various countries and different political traditions. Most of us share the idea that we came to gain experience which will also be useful for work in the groups and structures of our home countries.
Therefore, direct involvement in the different branches of civil work of the revolution is an important part of the education made possible by the Internationalist Commune: In womens' and youth structures, in communes and cooperatives. After the basic education which includes ideology and language we set off to work in society.
Learn to live with contradictions
“Coming from Europe, where revolution can be treated in a rather theoretical manner and the perspective on Rojava likewise remains a theoretical one, I was at first surprised at how many difficulties, compromises and problems I encountered in this revolution,” says Heval Baran from Germany, who came to Kurdistan about a year ago.
“You cannot develop a system for a free society without contradictions by sitting on your desk or having abstract theoretical discussions and then put it into practice just like that. Revolution is a process in which you encounter contradictions all the time. Enduring these contradictions and resolving them step by step without losing the revolutionary perspective – that's something people can learn in Rojava.”
The reason for the contradictions within the construction of a new society in Rojava is not just the fact that we are in a war zone. The influence of capitalism does not only show itself in the form of fighter jets or tanks.
“One of capitalist modernity's ways to influence the youth are the computer games. In Hileli alone there are four so-called counters where the youth go after school to play Counterstrike until the evening,” says the Italian internationalist Serhildan about the time they spent working with the youth in Hileli, a neighborhood in the outskirts of Qamislo.
“As a consequence of this excessive gaming they occupy themselves less with the reality they live in. They become passive. Their identity is defined by playing computer games and the counters become the center of their social relations.”
Superficial and sexist conceptions of beauty are found among the youth as well as the use of alcohol and drugs as an attempt to escape a reality perceived as depressive.
“The cruelties of the war waged by Daesh have a big destructive impact on young people without a strong ideological consciousness. After traumatising experiences the youth turn to alcohol in search of distraction and suppression, although drinking is accepted neither by traditional society nor by the political movement,” they explain. “Apart from the military attacks committed by Daesh, the Syrian regime and the fascist Turkish state there also are attacks of capitalist mentality, targeting the youth in particular with the aim of weakening the revolution.”
The complexity of the revolution stretches out into all areas of society: patriarchal family structures need to be overcome, and feudal clan structures must be transformed without causing open enmity towards the new society. Economic supply has to be guaranteed even under the most difficult conditions.
The revolution is a struggle which is not only fought militarily. Organising is the key to success. “This makes the works of the revolutionaries in Rojava even more important,” says Serhildan.
“The youth is given possibilities for education and the development of a revolutionary youth culture and identity is supported. This work requires daily involvement with the youth, in their families, in the counters and in youth centers. It requires daily discussions about the desires and goals of the youth and organising within the existing revolutionary structures.”
Constructing the self-administration
Cemile from France tells us about those who fight this fight relentlessly. They started their first works in Kobane with the Rojava Youth Union (YCR).
“The aim of our works in Kobane was to motivate the youth to take part in the revolutionary work and participate in all social structures and thus free them from their passive role in the capitalist system,” they say.
“The revolution here in Rojava is led by the autonomous women's and youth structures. The youth is still creative and open for change. They have no fear of going new ways and participate with a lot of energy and enthusiasm in all kinds of works. This creates an enormous social strength. The numerous young teachers finally have the possibility to teach their mother tongue and to research. They understand the importance of independent education and pass on their knowledge.”
The work among the youth aims at the construction of structures of democratic self-administration. “A big goal of our works was to give the youth a voice by bringing them closer to the practice of self-administration. This involved building youth councils, student organisations and making assemblies so they can collect their opinions and suggestions, talk about them and strengthen them.”
For Cemile as well as for dozens of other internationalists in the civil works these experiences are pointing the way ahead for their work in Europe: “All in all this time was very beautiful and educational,” they say. “What is special here, as opposed to living and working in Europe, is the openness of society towards critics, discussions and support.
“You just approach the people and by establishing and understanding of each other you solve problems or prevent them from coming into existence in the first place. Many things and processes are still complicated and far from perfect but there is a rapid development of mentality and methods of organising society as well as a development of the economical situation and the educational system. Those developments and methods leave me without doubt, that the revolution will continue advancing despite all the hostile influences from the exterior – like those of the Turkish state as well as those of capitalist ideology in general – and will keep pointing the way ahead for revolutionary work all over the world.”
Dialectic of perspectives
Work in society is also a site where different points of view encounter one another. “My internationalist perspective was something important that I could pass on to the youth,” says Cemile. “The importance of the progress here for revolutionary processes everywhere, their function as a role model for others, the connection between different fights which I consider necessary for a worldwide revolutionary change.”
While contributing the experiences of other left movements to the local struggles the internationalists at the same time change their own patterns of thought and perception. They can learn how to actually work outside of their own scene or subculture among the population. They learn how much patience this requires, but also not to present themselves as a missionary and rather as a human among humans.
“From the point of view of a radical left which rather distances itself from society instead of trying to organise it, working with society was a very important experience,” says Baran from Germany. “Visiting the families plays an important role in these works – the families who already support the revolution, as well as those who are closer to KDP or the Syrian regime. Back in Germany, political work always consisted of writing calls for action, organising protest marches, sitting in meetings and other similar activities. During my time in Derik I experienced how important it can be to visit a family and have dinner with them.”
The Australian Medical Association has labelled the Medicare Benefits Schedule freeze the single most damaging policy of the Coalition's election campaign and demanded it be phased out as soon as possible.
Recently elected AMA president Dr Michael Gannon also said that they didn't expect the rebate freeze, originally instituted by Labor and then extended by the Coalition to 2019-20, to be taken to the next election.

"I would be gobsmacked if the government took an ongoing freeze to the next election. They got the scare of their life on health and that was probably the policy which hurt them the most. It makes general practice and a lot of other areas of medical practice potentially unviable," Dr Gannon said, following a meeting with Health Minister Sussan Ley in Canberra.
They said that that the discussion, while not producing any "hard and fast" commitments, "did focus on the fact that health isn't the problem with the budget" and not where budget repair should be sought.
A couple of days ago we were notified by Google that our AdSense account was disabled for reasons unknown. What? How is this possible. Then I thought, well this is no good because I have never heard of anyone getting reinstated after this, even after appealing. I get another email a few hours later on my personal Gmail account from AdSense telling me that it was also disabled. The same message. Are you kidding me?
In order to have an AdSense or YouTube account you need to have a Gmail account. We created one for the business that we can all access. Google want's a real person associated with accounts so I put my name down as the point of contact. When we signed up for AdSense, I was point of contact but included our business information. I have a personal Gmail account and AdSense associated with it for YouTube videos. I know that you cannot have more that one AdSense account. I don't, I have my AdSense account and then there is an AdSense account in the business name with me as the point of contact.
We don't receive much money from AdSense but it's required to be a YouTube partner. We are (or were) trying to grow our YouTube subscriptions, create more original videos and use YouTube to host everything. Well when our AdSense account was disabled we received another email from YouTube/ This time informing us that we are not partners anymore because of not having an active AdSense account. So what is the point for us to use YouTube anymore? There is none.
Let's continue with AdSense and what I think happened. We have been getting quite a bit of “ghost” traffic to our website. This traffic is not coming from the same IP addresses and we have been unsuccessful in tracking it down even using multiple analytic programs like Google Analytics, Alexa, Quantcast and Compete. We also use CloudFlare, which helps with security by blocking DDOS attacks along with bad IP addresses. If they are getting to our site, we are assuming they are legit traffic. I noticed in AdSense that our final earnings were not matching the estimated earnings and it said it was because of invalid clicks. Invalid clicks are when the owner of the site is clicking on ads themselves, telling people to click on ads or making people click on ads to continue, etc.
We don't do that here. We are trying to run a legit business and AdSense isn't a big moneymaker for us. I spent nine months trying to get our site included into Google News. Now that we are in Google News, we would never jeopardize that relationship. It makes no sense what-so-ever. I tried contacting Google about these invalid clicks and if it's being caused by this “ghost” traffic to see if they have a solution for this because I know we are not the only people in the world that this has happened to and if anyone had a solution, it would be Google.
But you can't contact Google. They tell you to post your issues in the Google product forum. So I did that and no one was able to help me out because they are just publishers like us and don't have access to or work at Google. No one from Google posted in the thread. Look I understand that Google is huge and is contacted 10's of thousands of times a day for support but when you are accusing people of invalid clicks or click fraud you would think they would let you talk to someone. Especially after having an account for a 1.5 years with no issues.
I have yet to hear back from the business account appeal but was quickly denied my appeal with my personal account. This happening and the fact I'm writing about it makes me nervous that we might lose other products we use with Google like; our Google News listing and our Google Apps account along with all of our email. I tried reaching out to Google's public relation department to see if they wanted to make a statement but have yet to hear from them.

OKLAHOMA CITY - A video of an angry man confronting a panhandler taken here in the metro has gone viral on Facebook.
The video has received nearly 2 million views and more than 36,000 shares in just two days.
The video shows a man confront a 78-year-old woman, who allegedly begs for money at N.W. 140th St. and Pennsylvania Ave. on a daily basis.
The video was taken after they saw the woman get into a brand-new car.
Daniel Ayala says they approached the elderly woman and said, "You ask for money in the middle of the street and you're driving a 2013 car.”
Things got heated quickly between Ayala and the panhandler in far northwest Oklahoma City.
Graphic language: Language in the video may not be appropriate for all audiences.
"Listen, I work hard for my money. That's why people like you take advantage of people like me. This is bull****," said Ayala.
The woman behind the camera was with their son when they saw the beggar get into a brand-new Fiat.
"I was like, 'That's the lady I gave money to.' I was looking straight ahead thinking, 'I just got duped by a little old lady," said Brandi Newman.
They were taking a photo of the woman when they heard an angry man start yelling.
"If I see this car tomorrow. I'm going to f***ing bust a window," said Ayala.
Some people might say Ayala went too far with the threats, but they don't seem to think so.
"I gave that lady over $15 in five days. $15 could make me enough to come to work for gas. For them to just take my money like that," said Ayala.
Newman believes Ayala's threats were justified.
"Of course, it's not right to bash somebody's windshield in. I didn't think they were going to do that for a minute. He's just trying to prove a point that you don't come here again, don't do this again, quit scamming people," said Newman.
Ayala says they didn't know Newman was filming him.
"I'm famous, I'm going to Disney World," said Ayala.
Newman says the 78-year-old's family contacted them on Facebook and told them their grandmother has a panhandling permit.
The family says their grandmother "isn't doing anything illegal," and claim they are appalled by the video.
During the 1970s and 1980s, NGOs often initiated the call for specific policies and then lobbied members of Congress to create legislation. Such bipartisan action included clean water laws that restored Lake Erie and Ohio's Cuyahoga River or responded to dramatic events such as the Santa Barbara Oil Spill in 1969.
Republican and Democratic presidents of this era signed laws that had begun with grassroots demands for environmental action. Environmental issues, whether they were the effects of acid rain or the ozone hole, had become a prime concern in the political arena. Indeed, by the 1980s, NGOs had created a new political and legal battlefield as each side of environmental arguments sought to lobby lawmakers.
These gains by environmentalists had a ripple effect politically. In A Climate of Crisis, historian Patrick Allitt describes the opposition to environmentalism that emerged as a result of the bipartisan action on environment in the 1970s.
In particular, they describe the “anti-environmental” response manifested in policies of President Ronald Reagan, who slowed efforts to limit private development on public lands and set out to shrink the responsibilities of the federal government.
Antiregulation
Today, portions of this backlash appear to inform the views of candidates in the 2016 Republican presidential primary who reiterate the libertarian belief that it's best to severely limit government regulation of the environment.
And compared to the cooperative vision of past leaders including President Teddy Roosevelt and Congressman John Saylor, who fought in the 1960s for wilderness and scenic river legislation, the Republican environmental mandate of the past appears today to be stymied.
Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz, for example, tapped into this spirit when in December 2015 they held a three-hour “hearing” titled “Data or Dogma? Promoting Open Inquiry in the Debate over the Magnitude of Human Impact on Climate Change” (which technically was convened by the science panel of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation that they chair).
Prior to their hearing on the topic, climate change had been little discussed at the party's presidential debates; however, Cruz proclaimed that the “accepted science” proving climate change was actually a “religion” being forced on the American public by “monied interests.”
By contrast, Democrats stress the term “common sense” and appear more than content to allow their party to become the primary bastion for environmental concern. Hillary Clinton, as the likely Democratic presidential candidate, has often been publicly ahead of the Obama administration on environmental issues.
For instance, when in early 2015 Obama approved the expansion of Arctic drilling, Clinton openly opposed it. Also, Clinton was openly against the Keystone pipeline project long before Obama definitively rejected it.
In both Keystone and Arctic drilling, Obama allowed the issues a long and very public vetting process that has revealed a powerful, broad-based environmental lobby. NGOs such as 350.org and others have demonstrated a willingness for activist demonstrations, particularly due to a deep base of support for issues such as climate change and sustainable energy.
Republican candidates seem prepared to relent possible compromise on environmental questions in order to appeal to a special interest faction of their party. Overall, though, Gallup polling demonstrates broad-based support for environmental issues, including a solid 46 percent favoring protecting the environment over economic development.
Climate change worsens the political divide
Going forward, the most revealing flashpoint on issues related to the environment is likely to be climate change, particularly after the historic Paris Agreement of December 2015.
Global warming first made front page news in the 1980s when NASA scientist James Hansen testified to the Senate. Then in 2007, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) made history by specifying the connection between temperature rise and human activity with “very high confidence.”
In its relation to environmentalism, climate change represents a clear expansion of thinking. While local issues such as oil spills and toxic waste remain concerns, climate change clarified the possible planet-changing extent of the human impact. As a concept, it has had time to percolate through human culture so that today we are most concerned with issues of “mitigation” and “adaptation”—managing or dealing with implications.
In each case, these responses to climate change involve plans for regulations to, for example, limit carbon emissions. In response to the increasing call for structural changes to our economy and society, contrary voices (such as that of Cruz) have found traction by saying mitigation efforts will undercut economic development and, in general, disrupt our everyday lives.
Not surprisingly, concrete mitigation efforts, such as discussions of “cap and trade” legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions and international pacts such as COP21, have also spurred panicked responses among those destined to be impacted by the new thinking. For instance, coal companies and a number of states openly fight efforts by the EPA to monitor and regulate CO2 as a pollutant.
So who politicized the environment? Ultimately, voters have.
By tying environmental issues such as climate change to our system of laws and regulations at the end of the 1960s, Americans permanently chained these concerns to political vagaries in the future. Politics is now an integral part of the process of regulating the nation's environment and health.
Therefore, a better question might be: “Who exploits the issue of environmental protection for political gain?” That answer, it appears, unfolds today for American voters.

Let me tell you about Homestuck.
Homestuck is a webcomic that ran from 2009 to 2016. It was a story about a young man's journey to adulthood and self-discovery, with the added plot points of alternate timelines, godly powers, alien creators, Nicolas Cage and murder. Lots and lots of murder and death. It has spread across the four corners of the internet, spawned popular fan collaborations such as the Land of Fans and Music series and has become popular enough to find at least one person at a convention cosplaying as one of the numerous characters. It can be considered quite large.
The plot might have been complex and there might have been a lot of delays, but it made up for it with amazing soundtracks and Flash animations. In fact, one of them, known as [S] Cascade, was so long and large that it was hosted on numerous sites including Newgrounds to handle the traffic. How did it go? Newgrounds crashed.
In 2012, the author, Andrew Hussie, had an idea so crazy, so bizarre, so mind-breakingly drastic that it was uncertain how it would ultimately end. What they did was put up a Kickstarter for a Homestuck adventure game.
At the time, the premise of said game wasn't exactly clear other than, “hey, it's a game set in the world of this comic I made”. How did it do? Well, it originally asked for $700000 and hit the target in less than 24 hours; by the end, over 24000 fans had given almost $2.5 million to the project. Yes, that's not an over-exaggeration.
Now let me tell you about Hiveswap.
In 2014, it was announced that the game was going to be called Hiveswap and was going to be set sometime before 2009 (the beginning of the webcomic the Internet has grown to love, hate and steer clear from). A year later, more concept art, a trailer and some screenshots of the game were provided along with some rough estimation that development was almost finished. Many backers at this point were far from happy about not getting the game they put money on.
Near the beginning of 2016, there was another announcement: Hiveswap's art style was changing from 3D to 2D. As a result, there were even more delays for a title that was already a few years overdue. If you think that these setbacks are mainly due to lack of coordination for Andrew and their team, you're mistaken: the main contributor to this problem lies with the original developers.
It was revealed on Tumblr by a close friend of Hussie (known as ipgd) that they reached out to a group known as The Odd Gentlemen to work on Hiveswap. All seemed well at first, until two problems arose: they produced a demo that included the bare minimum (composed of a room and a glitch character), and it was revealed that they used a majority of the money to make another game known as King's Quest. That's right, TOG stole the money. In an interview with Polygon, they admitted that they chose to abandon an unnamed project in favour of King's Quest. In the end, all Hussie could do was break off from them with under $400000 for the project and was bound by a non-disclosure agreement; ipgd has since taken down the post as per request of Hussie and is no longer present on Tumblr.
Ultimately, they decided to gather a team and set up offices in New York for the game. However, according to some former members of the team known as WhatPumpkin, a majority of them were laid off. All that could be done was for them and what remained of their small team to move out of New York and work on the game.
That's essentially what happened.
It wasn't until December of last year that there was more news. This time, it was big. Hiveswap had appeared on Steam Greenlight with a trailer and release date under its belt. The game is depicted as a point-and-click adventure with colourful backgrounds and simplistic characters. Those who still remained in the Homestuck community rejoiced and shrugged as they learned the game they had been waiting for was going to come out sometime in January 2017.
It didn't happen. People remained hopeful as they were certain it would be released on April 13th (the date is the birthday of the webcomic, with the numbers 413, 612 and 1025 being important recurring numbers within the story). There was more news on the game, but sadly it wasn't news of a release date. Instead, the community was treated to a new trailer with no release date. Since then, WhatPumpkin has been posting interviews with those involved in the development of the game every Wednesday. As of writing this, at least two more interviews are to be expected (one of them with musician and creative success Toby Fox, known for hit works of art such as the album The Baby is You and Undertale); the release date for Hiveswap should be announced by the end of these interviews.
Hiveswap is a game that has gone through a lot of obstacles and rebranding over the years. Andrew Hussie could have just announced the game was cancelled after the incident with The Odd Gentlemen and continued working on their most popular comic, but no. Since then, they and WhatPumpkin have been trying their hardest to deliver what the promised. If you want to see what the will of a man (who people know barely anything about despite being a creative influence) looks like, play Hiveswap when it comes out, the game that cost one man a large portion of their fanbase.
Begin by thoroughly washing the potato and using a knife to remove any sprouts. Then, use a fork to stab holes throughout the potato, this allows steam to escape.
Next, microwave the potato for 5-8 minutes, depending on the potato's size. If your microwave has a 'Potato' button, use that. Start with just 5 minutes, test for firmness, and continue cooking the the potato until it is soft.
Place the potato on a cutting board or a clean, flat surface. Cut the potato in half.
Using a spoon, scoop out the white of potato and place it into a bowl. If you enjoy potato skins in your mashed potatoes, cut them into small pieces and add them to the bowl.
Next, add half of the cheese and a splash of milk.
Using a fork, begin mashing the potatoes by pressing the potato pieces against the bowl. Continue mashing, while slowly adding milk as needed, until your desired consistency is reached.
Now, top your bowl of potatoes with the remaining cheese.
Italy has a new president, Sergio Mattarella, a 73-year-old Sicilian judge whose politician brother was gunned down by the Mafia and died in their arms on the way to hospital.
The election of the softly spoken Mattarella, a veteran politician little known internationally but widely respected at home as an anti-corruption fighter, represents a significant victory for Italy's young centre-left Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.

In a remarkable display of political strength and strategy, Mr Renzi out-manoeuvred opponents - including their predecessor, Silvio Berlusconi - to secure an outright win for Mr Mattarella, their personal choice.
While Mr Berlusconi is banned from public office in the wake of a conviction for a multimillion-euro tax fraud, they remain a powerful figure and continues to be consulted by MPs of their Forza Italia party. Italian media and analysts had widely predicted that Mr Renzi would be forced to select a new president from a list of compromise candidates acceptable both to them and Mr Berlusconi.

"Post-truth" has come to describe a type of campaigning that has turned the political world upside down.
Fuelled by emotive arguments rather than fact-checks, it was a phrase that tried to capture the gut-instinct, anti-establishment politics that swept Donald Trump and Brexit supporters to victory.
Oxford Dictionaries made it the word of the year, defining it as where "objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief".
But what does this new world mean for academics and scientists whose whole purpose is trying to establish objective facts?
AC Grayling, public thinker, master of the New College of the Humanities, and Remain campaigner, views the post-truth world with undisguised horror.
The philosopher, awarded a CBE in the New Year Honours, warns of the "corruption of intellectual integrity" and damage to "the whole fabric of democracy".

But where do they think the post-truth world has come from?
"The world changed after 2008," says Prof Grayling - politics since the financial crash has been shaped by a "toxic" growth in income inequality.
As well as the gap between rich and poor, they say a deep sense of grievance has grown among middle-income families, who have faced a long stagnation in earnings.
With a groundswell of economic resentment, they say, it is not difficult to "inflame" emotions over issues such as immigration and to cast doubt on mainstream politicians.
Another key ingredient in the post-truth culture, says Prof Grayling, has been the rise of social media.
It's not the soundbite any more, but the "i-bite", they say, where strong opinion can shout down evidence.
"The whole post-truth phenomenon is about, 'My opinion is worth more than the facts.' It's about how I feel about things.
"It's terribly narcissistic. It's been empowered by the fact that you can publish your opinion. You used to need a pot of paint and a balaclava to publish your opinion, if you couldn't get a publisher.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Prof Grayling says the idea of post-truth has its roots in the financial crash
"But all you need now is an iPhone. Everyone can publish their opinion - and if you disagree with me, it's an attack on me and not my ideas.
"The fact that you can muscle your way on to the front row and be noticed becomes a kind of celebrity."
"Fake news" on social media became part of the post-election debate in the US - and Prof Grayling warns of an online culture that can't distinguish between fact and fiction.
"Put the words 'did the' into Google and one of the first things you see is, 'Did the Holocaust happen?' and the links will take you to claims that it didn't," they say.
This process is "corrosive of our public conversation and our democracy" and they warn of a culture where a few claims on Twitter can have the same credibility as a library full of research.
Image copyright AP Image caption Has the success of Donald Trump changed the rules of campaigning?
Appropriately for a philosopher, they identify post-modernism and relativism as the intellectual roots "lurking in the background" of post-truth.
"Everything is relative. Stories are being made up all the time - there is no such thing as the truth. You can see how that has filtered its way indirectly into post-truth."
They say this has unintentionally "opened the door" to a type of politics untroubled by evidence.
But hasn't this always been part of the battle of ideas?
Image copyright AP Image caption "Post-truth" was Oxford Dictionaries' word of the year for 2016
Prof Grayling tells the story of Adlai Stevenson, the unsuccessful liberal contender in the 1952 US presidential election, who was told: "Mr Stevenson, every thinking person in America is going to vote for you. And they said: 'Great, but I need a majority.'"
But the philosopher argues that there has been a significant shift beyond the boundaries of election spinning and into something fundamentally different.
They place their argument into a historical perspective, saying the international landscape is more like the volatile, intolerant era before World War Two.
"There are some really uncomfortable parallels with the 1930s," they say.
"These guys have realised you don't need facts, you just lie."
Sponsored content: this article was rewritten by the editor of SEW, in conjunction with Marchex, to include new research in August 2016.
Whether someone is searching on their mobile device for a restaurant, a local service, or a car rental, the presence of a click-to-call button increases click-through rates and brand perception.
You've probably seen a click-to-call button before. It's the little telephone symbol that appears when you carry out a local search…
It's this simple two-tap process that makes dealing with businesses and retailers so much easier when you're out and about. There's no fiddly form-filling or complicated navigation. You just tap to make a direct call.
It's this ease-of-use that makes click-to-call one of the most important features for all businesses with a mobile presence. And many studies back this up.
The power of click-to-call
An older survey of 3,000 mobile searchers by Google in 2013, revealed that 70% of mobile searchers click-to-call a business directly from Google's search results.
However in 2015, the mobile advertising analytics company Marchex suggested that the number of click-to-calls (or call extensions) from mobile would increase from 40 million phone calls monthly in 2013, to nearly one billion in 2015.
According to Marchex's report, it was predicted that in 2015 Americans would spend more than $1 trillion in click-to-call ecommerce.
And recently, BIA/Kelsey estimated that there will be 93 billion consumer-to-business phone calls made from smartphones, and this is expected to grow to $162 billion by 2019.
As for call commerce opportunities per vertical, automotive is the leading category with $15.9 billion ad spend.
This is followed by cable and telecom ($15.5 billion), financial services ($15.5 billion), home services ($5.4 billion) and travel ($2.3 billion).
Google Ads click-to-call
Within Google Ads, Google generated more than 40 million calls each month – 75% of those calls lasting longer than 30 seconds, and the majority of calls from ads lasted an average of six minutes. This suggests that most mobile searchers aren't looking for quick information.
On average, Google said that Google Ads advertisers who implement click to call see an 8% increase in click-through rate.
And what about businesses that don't offer a call option? Almost half of those surveyed said “the lack of a call option would lead them to be both frustrated with the business and more likely to turn to another brand.”
Additionally, 33% said that they would be less likely to refer the brand to others and would be less likely to use the brand in the future.”
Where marketers need to be careful
However there is a potential blindspot when it comes to click-to-call. Advertisers invest heavily to drive phone calls from consumers but there's little visibility into which keywords result in desired sales. Advertisers are ignoring attribution.
Marchex analysed more than 1 million phone calls made directly from mobile search ads and it estimated that marketers spent more than $4 billion on mobile search ads in 2014 to drive phone calls.
As the study reveals, “This means that lack of keyword attribution in click-to-call is one of the biggest blind spots that exist in mobile advertising today.”
If you want to invest wisely in click-to-call, you need to monitor keyword attribution, measure customer intent and include keyword level data in your paid search automation platforms.

uBeam is a bit of a mystery in Silicon Valley. The wireless charging company claims to have developed a way to charge electronic devices using ultrasonic waves, for truly cord-less charging regardless of what surface your smartphone is touching. The company has been criticized for avoiding detailed discussions and demonstrations of its technology, drawing comparisons to disgraced blood-testing company Theranos.
But yesterday, uBeam showed off its wireless charging tech at the Upfront Summit in Los Angeles. The demonstration was supposed to be “off the record,” which is a strange thing to tell a crowd of people with video cameras in their pockets. As you might suspect, various video of the demo are now floating around Twitter. Here's a solid one shot by Zillow Group CEO Spencer Rascoff:
Wireless charging of a phone thru the air. Woh. 1st public demo ever @ubeam #UpfrontSummit pic.twitter.com/I6GZx7KDri — Spencer Rascoff (@spencerrascoff) February 3, 2017
In the video, you can clearly see uBeam CEO Meredith Perry holding what appears to be an Android phone near some type of device and waiting momentarily before a charging symbol appears on the display. Of course, the goal is to shrink down that large box into a device consumers could purchase and keep in their homes.
As Axios points out, uBeam's ultimate goal is to create a device resembling a small satellite dish-shaped charger, but that may be a while off. There are still a ton of other technical questions, too, as to how the company can overcome the limits of physics to create a product that works consistently as designed. Still, it's a promising first suggestion that uBeam's foundational concept is actually sound.
Nisar says Pakist­an will neithe­r procee­d with talks nor play cricke­t in India until it 'behave­s respon­sibly'
ISLAMABAD: Taking note of Shiv Sena's rampant anti-Pakistan activism, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said on Monday that the government would push the United Nations to list the Hindu extremist group among the world's terrorist organisations.
The minister was holding a meeting with selected journalists, where they also said that Pakistan would not proceed with any talks with India until New Delhi ‘behaves responsibly'.
Nisar further said that they would also not approve of playing cricket with India.
“We will not play cricket in India, I will oppose it,” they said.
Shiv Sena storms BCCI HQ to protest Indo-Pak cricket meeting
The interior minister's statements came in the wake of growing tension between the cricket boards of Pakistan and India as next month's scheduled series between the two countries remain in doubt after both sides once again failed to reach an agreement on where the matches should be played.
Shahryar Khan wants to know India's reason to not play in UAE
Earlier in October, a meeting between Pakistan and India's cricket board officials was cancelled after Shiv Sena workers stormed the Mumbai office of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), further worsening matters.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has asked the PCB not to take any decision without prior approval from the government, Express News reported.
“The board should not decide about going to India before clear instructions are given,” the statement read.

CANTON (CBS) – A woman and a one-year-old boy were pulled from a heavily damaged car by Good Samaritans and firefighters after a major crash on Interstate 93 in Canton late Friday morning.
They were riding in a gray Honda in the northbound lanes when it was crushed in the middle of a chain-reaction crash involving a tractor-trailer, a van and a pickup-style truck.
Jean Paul LaPierre was among the first at the scene. They said the baby was deep in the mangled car, but could be heard crying.
LaPierre said another man arrived soon after and helped them free the injured child from their carseat and pull them from the car.
“Sometimes in life you're called upon and you've just got to act,” said LaPierre. “I just kept thinking we've got to get that baby out and make sure both of them could breathe. It was something to be able to get that baby out of there.”
Good Samaritan recalls Canton rescue
LaPierre credits another man for helping them pry the baby out of the vehicle.
Once the baby was pulled from the car, LaPierre and others used crow bars to attempt to help the woman out.
They were conscious and concerned for the baby, LaPierre said.
“Her cries inspired you to do whatever you have to do to get that child out,” said LaPierre, who received several cuts and scratches during their rescue efforts.
Firefighters arrived soon after and took them from the car using the jaws of life.
The boy was taken to South Shore Hospital in Weymouth.
A MedFlight rescue helicopter was called in and both sides of the highway were shut down briefly so it could land. The injured woman was rushed to Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
State Police said a trooper drove the ambulance so both EMTs could be free to treat them in the back of the vehicle.  They are expected to be moved to Boston Children's Hospital, according to police.
There's still no word yet what caused the series of rear-end collisions of if anyone will be charged.
LaPierre said they hope others will do the same if presented the opportunity to help with a rescue in the future.
“I hope that people can take from this is not to be afraid to help out your fellow man. I think that's the only message I've got. Don't be afraid to step in and do what you've got to do,” LaPierre said.

Mountain Lion Shot in Iowa County. Kill Has People Divided
Associated Content ^ | Dec. 15, 09 | Sherry Tomfeld
Posted on by stillafreemind
The DNR has refuted claims that they have brought mountain lions into Iowa to help control the deer population. But many do not believe that. This cat was checked by the DNR for a tag. None was found. Why would they look for a tag if mountain lions in Iowa are rare and wild?

I hope they donated the meat to a few families that are struggling to keep stomachs filled. Other than that, the animal was a menace and deserved to be shot. An animal's right to live, IMHO stops as soon as it's claws/paws/horns/teeth/tail touches a person or a person's property.

Deer are food for predators. They draw them. We now have coyotes in northern Ohio and a swelling population of bears. I like wildlife, but not when it can chew up the girl next door during a jog in the park.

If the cat were in the back country, I'd lean toward leaving it alone and notifying a local ranger. If it was on a large farm, I'd probably leave it alone, if it were a long ways from the house, or a community. If it's near a community, it needs to be relocated or put down.

Why would they look for a tag if mountain lions in Iowa are rare and wild? Perhaps it broke out of it's containment on private property. Or it strayed away from MO, MN or some other state where the state has tagged some of these animals What I find interesting is that the story doesn't say anything about the DNR officials searching for implanted ID.

Deer are unsatisfactory food for predators. What is needed is a heard of Arctic reindeer. They can run 50 MPH and on any given day any given reindeer can escape a pack of wolves, or any other predator. They taste better too AND, best of all, are a good source of vitamin B12 ~ and other B vitamins, as well as elemental iron. With a little assistance they could easily force the whitetails so beloved of bears and wildcats out of the range.

They are living in the Pennsylvania north woods. I know this as a fact (personal experience). If you want to get a Game Commission official bent out of shape, ask one why they are covering up the existence of mountain lions in the State. I can't figure out their denial, other than they may be complicit in placing them.

Those big cats must be real survivors; we even have them moving into Alaska from Canada. A few have been caught in snares; alot more sighted. I'm still waiting on somebody to show up with bigfoot in the truck bed.

Mountain Lions can move up to 30 miles in one day. Iowa doesn't have uninhabited wilderness areas for these critters to roam. This cat needs to be killed. For sure it was near homes and farms.

Pro-Corbyn blogger @Rachael_Swindon is one of the most tireless campaigners for Labour, Corbyn and a fairer society that you'll ever find.
As well as blogging and creating some of the strongest memes to support Labour's message, they are a full-time mother of two kids who also cares full-time for their disabled husband, who recently took a turn for the worse. As a result, they and their family are in the support group of ESA and PIP, which allowed them – just about – to scrape by, except when the DWP screwed up.
Until now.
Because of their effectiveness, Rachael has angered right-wingers both inside and outside the Labour party. Because they have a ‘donate' button on their blog, in case the occasional donation comes in to help eke out meagre benefits, someone made a malicious report to the DWP, triggering an investigation.
Let's be clear, Rachael has done nothing wrong – being on benefits doesn't mean someone can't give you a gift. It's not earned income. But the DWP has suspended all benefits to Rachael and their family while they investigate – pushing them into desperate straits that have now become very desperate indeed..
This is part of a clearly coordinated series of attacks on some of the most effective pro-Corbyn bloggers and campaigners. The SKWAWKBOX has been targeted, as have others.
The ‘person' responsible for this is slime. But there are far more good -hearted people out there.
If you are able to help Rachael, however small the amount, please go as soon as you can to their blog and use the donate button. Thank you for your help for great campaigner in an emergency, who's paying a high price for doing the right thing – and for your support for the cause of making this a better country to live in.

The Game of making Games - a Metaphor
Foreword
"Make small games" is the advice that everyone hears when starting out with game development. But that's is nothing that we want to hear while fantasizing about our insanely big dream project. Let's face it, small games seem boring.
But...
The Game Metaphor
Let's put it into terms that we all understand.
It's one of those rainy afternoons. Some guy, let's call them Link, decides to become a game developer. Of course, they have big plans. They want to make a MMORPG. Oh wait that's boring. Let's say, they are a Hero in a role playing game, and they want to slay a big dragon!
Link just started their journey today, that pretty much makes them a level 1 hero. They have barely any skills, their wooden sword is weak, their wooden armor is thin and they only has money for two or three healing potions (just in case...).
The dragon on the other hand, this untamed beast is level 60. It's big, it's strong and it kills everyone who gets close to it.
As in every role playing game, there is a huge world with all kinds of fascinating things between Link and the Dragon. There are other heroes, some are friendly and some aren't. There are thousands of monsters everywhere in the world. Some are weak, some are almost as strong as the dragon. Some of them are in dungeons and they are so strong that only a group of brave heros might have a chance to kill them.
Now I am asking you the reader, how can Link slay their dragon?
Plan #1 - think big
Link may be only level 1, but they sure are motivated, enthusiastic and dedicated. They do the obvious thing, they walk right towards where the dragon lives, and they face him.
Link walks up to them and slays their wooden sword right into the sleeping dragon's head. The sword breaks without hurting the dragon at all, the dragon doesn't even feel it. But Link is brave, they walk into the woods, finds some sticks and stones and quickly crafts themselves a spear. They walk back to the dragon, and throws their spear right into the sleeping dragon's eye.
A loud roaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar... spreads through the world. The dragon was hurt, and they are now awake. The spear made a total of 1 damage - sadly the dragon still has 999 health left.
Now its on. The dragon spies a huge load of fire towards Link. Their weak wooden armor starts to burn and does a lot of damage to our hero. But Link won't give up, they drink a potion and once again they walk back into the woods, crafts themselves a new armor and tries again. On their next attack, they managed to do 1 more damage.
Only 998 health left...
The sun rises and falls day after day, and our level 1 Link keeps fighting the beast. It has been a long time since they started fighting the dragon. And even though they are the single most dedicated hero in the whole world, they run out of energy eventually. After what feels like a year of fighting, Link is a mess. They hate their weak weapons, they haven't slept in days, they are hungry, they have no more money to buy new potions.
The dragon spits fire right into Link. Their weak wooden armor starts to burn again and ultimately they die a slow and painful death.
Plan #2 - successive
suc-ces-sive [/səkˈsesiv/]: Following one another.
Let's start again. This time, our level 1 Link starts by killing level 1 wolves. They get stronger, they built some muscles, used the wolves' fur to make better armor and traded the wolves' eyes for a better sword. It's time to fight level 10 orcs now...
Our Link fights hard every day, and soon they advanced to level 30. They met a few friendly heroes along the way, and they decided to go into a dungeon and slay a big evil spider. It's a hard battle. Link continues to get stronger and stronger.
Five years later, it's another one of those rainy Sunday afternoons. Link's thoughts drift away as they remember all the monsters that they have killed, all the powerful new weapons that they found and all the mistakes that they made.  They are now a powerful and well respected warrior.  They are the leader of a huge guild called Vedemag, and they have thousands of potions in their backpack.
As the clouds melt away and the sun shines right into their eyes, they remember the dragon. The untamed beast that got them into this in the first place. Link never gives up, so they decide it's time to fight the dragon again.
They walk up to the dragon and starts by smashing their holy sword right into the dragon's eye. The dragon awakes, a loud roaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar... spreads through the world again. This time, they made 100 damage - now the dragon has only 900 health left.
As Link raises their hand, their whole guild appears behind them on the horizon. Fearlessly they run towards the dragon and fight them with everything they have. The hours pass by as the dragon gets weaker and weaker in what seems to be the biggest fight in Link's life. The dragon becomes weaker and weaker. They can barely breath, as Link attacks them with their sword for the last time.
Our hero has slain the dragon. After a long journey full of practice, failure and persistence they finally reached theirs goal.
Summary
Dear reader, you are Link. The Dragon is your big dream project. The heroes are your fellow game developers. The wolves are those little one-week game projects, and the orcs are the slightly bigger 6-month projects. The big evil spider will be your first one-year multiplayer game.
Right now you are only equipped with a wooden sword (a few tools that kinda suck). You have to be patient and keep fighting, and ultimately your wooden sword will turn into a powerful holy sword (like a Game Engine or a powerful Framework). The potions are your food, so make sure to farm enough gold in order to pay for it. And most importantly, your wooden armor is your mind. It's up to you to strengthen it by failing and succeeding over and over again.
Be patient, enjoy the journey and don't be so crazy to fight the dragon right away!
The President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker talks with U.S. President Donald Trump prior to a working session during the G20 summit in Hamburg, northern Germany | Markus Schreiber/AFP via Getty Images Juncker: Europe cannot rely on US for its defense Commission president says Britain's decision to leave EU galvanized support among remaining countries.
Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said the European Union could not continue to rely on the United States for its defense, according to an interview published in an Austrian newspaper.
Speaking about the state of the EU, Juncker said that Europeans' views of the bloc were improving, but that the region could not turn to the United States for its future protection.
"It becomes clear that we cannot, in the long-term, rely on American defense support," Juncker told Tiroler Tageszeitung, a newspaper in Austria where they are on vacation.
The Commission president added that Britain's decision to leave the EU had galvanized support among the remaining countries in the bloc.
A survey published Friday suggested that voters in eight European countries — France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Sweden — were now more likely to see EU membership as an advantage for their country than before Britain's Brexit referendum last summer. The study was commissioned by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, a Berlin-based think tank with ties to the German Social Democrats.
"The British Brexit decision was seen by many in Europe as an appeal to close the ranks," Juncker said. "None of the 27 member states have collapsed."

July 1, 2011: Large industrial fans were being used Friday to cool off more than 100 orphan dogs and cats at the Animal Welfare League after thieves destroyed the adoption center's main air conditioning units. (Published Saturday, July 2, 2011)
Large industrial fans were being used Friday to cool off more than 100 orphan dogs and cats at the Animal Welfare League after thieves destroyed the adoption center's main air conditioning units.
After an event Thursday night, organizers noticed the center felt hot and found the AC units damaged on the roof. One unit was completely broken, the other torn apart.
"The wires were cut and the copper piping and coils on the inside were stolen," said AWL manager Diane Spryka.
With the July heat, Spryka is scrambling keep the animals safe.
Second City Animal Stories
"We need the ventilation. We need the air circulating to have air exchanged for our animals," they said.
Some animals exposed to high temperatures for long periods of time could suffer from severe health consequences and even death, said Bridget Nolan, a volunteer at the shelter.
One of the AC units can be fixed, but the estimated cost for its repair is $20,000, an unaffordable price for the shelter on a tight budget.

"We need funds," said Spryka, near tears. "It saddens me because for 35 years we've been here to serve the community. Now the funds we receive that could be going directly to the animals will be used elsewhere to stabilize the units."
“Karma will come back to them I hope,” said Susan Naiden, Founder of Trio Animal Foundation, which is coordinating the fundraising effort to come up with the projected $25,000 cost to replace the stolen and damaged equipment.
A short-term fix late Friday buoyed the spirits of shelter staff. Donors had ponied up three temporary air conditioning units to help cool the shelter.
"Everyone has been warm and gracious," Spyrka communicated to a donor who telephoned the shelter, their voice trembling with emotion. "People really want to help, which is awesome. It's a good thing. It sucks that it has to come this way though... We've been here 75 years. I've been here 38 years. I mean we're just trying to do the right thing."
The damage to and theft of air conditioning units is not isolated. There's been a rash of damage to and thefts of central air and window units. Police say thieves are going after the copper tubing and selling it for cash.

For years, economists, politicians and pundits have been debating the pros and cons of using a “carbon tax” to combat climate change. In its simplest form, the tax would be a per-ton levy on carbon dioxide emissions from electric power stations and industrial boilers that are fueled by coal, oil or natural gas.
Those in favor argue that by adopting such a tax we could rid ourselves of dozens of burdensome regulations and mandates that inhibit investment and economic growth. Unlike the distorting effects of regulation, a tax on emissions would give companies flexibility to come up with their own cost-effective strategies for reducing CO2. Indeed, virtually all of the Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory oversight over carbon emissions could eventually be eliminated as well as President Obama's Clean Power Plan.
Opponents of a carbon tax make two basic arguments. The first is that a “tax is a tax,” and consumers and businesses who will ultimately bear the burden are already over-taxed. The second, and more salient argument against a carbon tax, is the difficulty in estimating the “social cost of carbon (SCC),” a necessary first step in determining the level of the tax. In theory, this term represents the economic cost caused by an additional ton of carbon dioxide emissions or its equivalent. Currently set at $36 per ton by the EPA, the social cost of carbon underpins justifications for policies dealing with everything from power plants to car mileage to refrigerator efficiency. In reality, the SCC is a malleable concept driven largely by analysts' initial assumptions and the choice of model utilized to generate dollar estimates.
Several weeks ago, a group of Republican elder statesmen calling themselves the Climate Leadership Council, including former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker, endorsed the idea of a carbon tax that would start at $40 a ton and rise gradually over time. The Council claims that such a tax would send a powerful market signal to businesses that want certainty when planning for the future. The proceeds from the tax would be returned to households through carbon dividends, thus making the tax revenue neutral.
Another potential benefit of a carbon tax is that it would help secure the future of nuclear power as part of the nation's energy mix. America today gets about 20 percent of its electricity from clean-burning, non carbon-emitting nuclear power plants. Ninety-nine generators are currently operating and four new reactors are under construction in Georgia and South Carolina. But since 2013, six plants have been shut down across the U.S. and another nine are scheduled to close in the near future, most notably the two Indian Point reactors north of New York that provide 25 percent of that city's electricity.
Nuclear energy is also being challenged by cheap and abundant natural gas, which has become the preferred fuel for power generation and now accounts for nearly 35 percent of installed capacity nationwide. Indeed last year U.S. power plants burned more natural gas than coal for the first time. In short, nuclear energy can't compete with natural gas (or coal, for that matter) at current prices. But to the extent a carbon tax increased the cost of generating electricity from natural gas and coal plants, the playing field for nuclear energy would be more even.
If we believe combating climate change is a serious matter, nuclear energy—the most environmentally benign technology for generating electricity—must be part of the arsenal. A carbon tax can help ensure nuclear's long-term future.

Stephen Colbert is assuring the Federal Election Commission (FEC) that the dollar bills they collected in exchange for handshakes outside of their building last month went to them and not the “super PAC” he's hoping to form.“Colbert Super PAC is not yet a legal entity and no individual is accepting contributions on its behalf. Funds collected by Mr. Colbert from the crowd outside the Commission after they filed their Advisory Opinion Request were not contributions to the PAC; they were $1 bills received by Mr. Colbert personally as payment for shaking their hand,” three lawyers working for Colbert wrote.
The FEC had some follow-up questions about Colbert's original request for a media exemption for their yet-to-be-formed political action committee, which would allow their show to fund the activities of “Colbert Super PAC” without it counting as an in-kind contribution.
Another question from the FEC: “Is the continued operation of Colbert Super PAC's website and activities dependent on the show? If the show stopped covering Colbert Super PAC because it was thought to be stale or no longer funny, would Viacom cease providing support to it?”
Said Colbert's team: “Colbert Super PAC could be operated by Mr. Colbert without reference to it on The Colbert Report. Mr. Colbert, however, does not foresee any circumstances under which the show would lose interest in something they are doing. Indeed, they expect that coverage of their offset activities through the vehicle of Colbert Super PAC will provide significant additional content for the show.”
Good government groups — including the Campaign Legal Center, which is headed by Colbert's lawyer — want the FEC to reject Colbert's request because it “would permit the corporate media employer of these individuals to make unlimited, undisclosed contributions to their PACs under the guise of the ‘press exemption'.”
“Although we recognize that Mr. Colbert submitted their advisory opinion in the spirit of political comedy, an opinion by the FEC permitting all that Mr. Colbert requests would have a sweeping and damaging impact on disclosure laws and the public's right to know about campaign finance activities,” Paul S. Ryan, FEC Program Director at the Campaign Legal Center, said in a statement.
Blue Blubber Jellyfish- Facts and Photo's
An unusually colored blue blubber jellyfish (Catostylus mosaicus), spotted off the west coast of Mafia Island in Tanzania. These jellyfish vary in color, depending on which part of the world they are from. In some parts of the world they are known as the jelly blubber. They can vary from white to light blue and purple. Blue blubber jellyfish in Tanzania have always been known to have blue tentacles, however this one is unique with red-brown tentacles. Possibly the change of coloring is related to breeding behavior, but this is speculation., .
APPEARANCE
The bell of the blue blubber jellyfish grows to approximately 30-45 cm (12–18 in) in width although they are usually slightly smaller. Bell colors range from a creamy white to a brown and blue color. The bell pulsates and is used to propel the jelly forwards. They have eight arms with tentacles that can also vary in color. Each of the eight arms have several small mouths that catch and transport food to the jelly's stomach.There is no mouth as such, rather there are numerous small openings on each arm. Food is passed through these openings to the stomach. The tentacles have stinging cells that can capture tiny crustaceans and small fish.
STINGS
The eight tentacles have large numbers of nematocysts or stinging cells on them. These are similar to a tube that has been pulled inside out into its self with a sharp point and has a mechanism to pump poison through the end of the point. These nematocysts are extremely small, about 0.001 mm in diameter. There is a trigger on the exterior of the tentacle and when this trigger is activated either chemically or physically the tube or tubule as it is known inverts its self. Pushing outwards and pushing the point into the prey, it then pumps poison up the tubule into the prey. This process of firing takes place in 700 nano seconds which is extremely fast and occurs with substantial pressure. In some species the point is able to penetrate the shell of small crustaceans.
There are two types of stinging cells in jellies tentacles , nematocysts and spirocysts and these inject canhypnotoxin, thalaxin and congestin into the prey. Hypnotoxin has an anaesthetic effect and paralyzes the prey. Thalaxin has an allergenic action, generating an inflammatory reaction. Congestin paralyzes the circulatory and respiratory systems of the prey.
The effect of the sting of the blue blubber jellyfish on humans is mild compared to some jellyfish. Usually the sting results in a slight redness around the area where the tentacles have touched, however some individuals may be more allergic than others. The area may be itchy for some time.
IN THE WILD
In Tanzanian waters blue blubber jellyfish are often seen in spring and summer, usually solitary but large blooms can develop. See below for images of these blooms. They are slow swimmers and easy for a swimmer to avoid. Juveniles are often white in color and are sometimes shadowed by small fish.
NERVE NET
Blue blubber jellyfish do not have what we would traditionally call a brain or centralized concentration of nerve cells. Instead they have a nerve net distributed throughout the body which has various simple sensors on it and operates in a decentralized fashion. Information is transmitted through the net and via a circular net that runs around the bell with rhopalia on it, small structures containing sensors to sense light and gravity.
The circular net around the bell also controls the contraction of the bell for propulsion. Jellies use their light sensing cells to orientate themselves against the light. They use pulsations of their bell to propel themselves forward and having no sight, have limited control over where they will end up, their directional logic being generally limited to either moving away from light or towards it. Recent research indicates that some jellies may orientate their direction on a current but this is not yet proven.
HABITAT
The Blue blubber jellyfish is found in coastal parts of the Indo-Pacific preferring the warmer waters.
DIET
Blue blubber jellyfish obtain their nutrition in two ways. They have a symbiotic relationship with various types of algae (zooxanthellae) which provide them with some of their nutrition. During the day they spend their time closer to the surface for the algae to be exposed to more sunlight. At dusk they head lower in the water table and rely on their tentacles to catch small fishes as well as crustaceans and zooplankton. The stinging cells on the tentacles are used to capture prey.
REPRODUCTION
Jellyfish or sea jellies can reproduce through both sexual and asexual reproduction. During the Medusa stage specialized organs known as gonads form either eggs or sperm. In some species, female jellies release eggs into the water table. These are fertilized by sperm released by the males. In others the eggs are fertilized in the stomach of the female when the sperm released by the males swims into the females stomach and then fertilize them there.
Some jellies such as the moon jelly have special areas on the oral arms which function as brood chambers. The eggs hatch into larvae known as planula with cilia on them allowing them to swim and these attach themselves onto a firm substrate and develop into polyps called scyphistomae. These polyps produce numbers of ephyra, that detach and swim off to grow into the medusa stage. The polyps can also bud asexually producing other polyps.
COMMENSAL RELATIONSHIPS
Research has shown that there are commensal relationships between certain copepods and the blue blubber jellyfish. Paramacrochiron maximum, a copepod are found in high numbers living on the oral arms of blue blubber jellyfish. Some species of fish use the blue blubber jellyfish (Catostylus mosaicus) for protection and swim inside the jelly when they feel threatened as can be seen in the images below.
COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION
In the far east in countries such as China and Japan, blue blubber jellyfish are regarded as delicacies. They are sometimes dried and powdered or added to stews, but they are also eaten as sushi and sashimi. Being 90 % water they have very little fat in them !
AQUARIUMS
Blue blubber jellyfish are kept in various public aquariums and some enthusiasts keep them in special tanks. Advances in technology now allow jellies to be kept in small tanks with currents in them that prevent the jellies from hitting the sides.
Because they are easy to feed blue blubber jellyfish are becoming more popular. Small relatively cheap tanks which can be purchased to house them and they can live for up to a year in captivity. Because jellies fluoresce under ultra violet light a jellyfish tank can make an attractive addition to a room.
BLOOMS OF BLUE BLUBBER JELLYFISH
In some years the blue blubber jellyfish bloom in the channel between Mafia Island and the Tanzanian mainland, congregating in large numbers. This creates havoc for the local fishermen as they clog their nets. Because of these blooms, catches often consist of more jellyfish than fish as can be seen in the images below.
This deprives the local fishermen of their main food source and times are tough for them during these jellyfish blooms. As a result of having to remove large numbers of jellyfish from the nets the fishermen are often stung on multiple occasions.
It is not really known for sure as to what causes these blooms. However in all probability, they relate to favorable water and feeding conditions. Small fishes partially ingested can be seen in the images above.
The main predators of blue blubber jellyfish are leatherback turtles and some species of fish such as tuna and sunfish. Because populations of these predators are dropping, this may be an additional contributory cause of the blooms.

Apple isn't colluding with the NSA to hand over user data and CEO Tim Cook wants you to know that. In fact, Cook feels so strongly about this issue of security that he's gone on record saying the government would need "to cart [Apple's employees] out in a box" to get access to its servers. That choice soundbite comes from a sitdown interview, airing tonight on ABC, during which Cook elaborates on what they see as public misperception stemming from the recent NSA scandal. To counter that, Cook said he's been "pushing very, very hard" for more transparency into Apple's internal practices, a move they hope would help to set the record straight with the general public.
Cook is also expected to touch upon other topics outside of the NSA breach, like the company's heavily-anticipated plunge into wearables, and the measures Apple takes to maintain secrecy surrounding its product roadmap. You can watch the teaser clip from the full interview with Cook just after break.
Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall is detailing how they would frame a public inquiry into murdered and missing aboriginal women, calling for an examination of "systemic issues" such as the role of the federal and provincial governments in the tragedies.
Mr. Wall's proposal – which they are taking to their provincial colleagues and national aboriginal leaders Wednesday at the opening meeting of the Council of the Federation in Charlottetown – is more specific than other premiers have been so far. Mr. Wall is also at odds with Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who recently dismissed renewed calls for an inquiry, arguing that the deaths should be viewed as crimes and not as a "sociological phenomenon."
The Prime Minister's remarks came in response to the outcry over the violent death of Manitoba teenager Tina Fontaine, whose body was found last week wrapped in plastic in Winnipeg's Red River. Earlier this year, the RCMP reported that more than 1,000 aboriginal women were victims of homicide between 1980 and 2012, and 164 women were missing.

"We wouldn't agree that there isn't a societal thing, there," Mr. Wall said in an interview with The Globe and Mail.
"Obviously, there are also societal things here where the country as a whole and the two levels of governments bear some responsibility to determine what else can be done and done better, including the province of Saskatchewan," Mr. Wall said.
At last year's Council of the Federation meeting, premiers and territorial leaders supported calls for a national inquiry. They are expected to press again this week for an inquiry although several of the big players have changed – Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador are without permanent premiers and federalist Premier Philippe Couillard is now in charge in Quebec.
Mr. Wall's proposal is three-pronged: An inquiry would look at how to prevent crimes or how to solve them quickly when they do happen; consider the role and responsibility of the federal and provincial governments; and look at the responsibility of native communities.
"I think there is a responsibility piece," they said, adding that "over 40 per cent of violence against aboriginal women can be at the hands of family or spouses."
They say that there must be responsibility taken not just at the level of the national aboriginal leadership but at the reserve level, at band councils, and among elders and mentors.
Mr. Wall is not alone in their concern over this issue. Other premiers, including Ontario's Kathleen Wynne and Manitoba's Greg Selinger, have criticized Prime Minister Harper for their remarks. Ms. Wynne characterized them as "outrageous."

Last week, Prime Minister Harper also said that there "has been a very fulsome study of this particular, of these particular things. They're not all one. They're not all one phenomenon."
Mr. Wall acknowledged that there have been studies and recommendations into various aspects of the issue – they believe there have been at least 29 reports or inquiries and 500 recommendations since 1996.
"We need to have a look at what has already been recommended and where we're at," they said. "Have governments including provincial governments actually been responding or not?"
Assembly of First Nations interim national chief Ghislain Picard is attending Wednesday's meeting. They told The Globe and Mail that the issue of murdered and missing indigenous women will most certainly "overshadow" the talks with the premiers.
They say it's a positive step that the premiers have renewed their calls for an inquiry – and that they have rejected the Prime Minister's "totally unacceptable" reaction to Ms. Fontaine's death.
However, they want a plan of action to be developed, as well as a national inquiry. Chief Picard also says there are steps premiers can take now to help with the problem – but they will not say what those are, preferring to hear first from the premiers.

Last month in Halifax at the AFN's annual general assembly, the chiefs passed a resolution supporting national roundtables as "part of a framework for developing the national dialogue with respect to the on-going issue." They will also continue to push for a national inquiry.
Today is apparently Pixel leak day. After getting some new details on pricing and spotting the phone in a Nest ad, some actual photos of the phones have emerged. The image above (and another below) show both phones side-by-side. This marks the first time we've actually seen the phones in the flesh—er, metal. Whatever.
The images show both phones in the aluminum finish, which does look very light above. I think that's down to the harsh lighting. The top of the rear panel is clearly lighter and smoother (it's glass). The fingerprint sensor is up there as well. There are some IDs and markings obscured for obvious reasons.
The front has that same sensor layout we've seen before, and the bezels are a little big. Feel free to complain about that in the comments. From what we understand, the Pixel XL will be 5.5-inches, and the Pixel will be 5-inches. The displays are on, but there's not much we can glean from them. The XL has a standard lock screen up, and the Pixel appears to be running the new boot animation. Another few weeks and we'll hopefully get a better look at these babies.

Stu Jackson, the former head of NBA player discipline, believes Boston Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas should draw a one-game suspension for hitting Atlanta Hawks guard Dennis Schroder in the head Friday night.
Jackson appeared on NBA TV after the controversial play, which took place during the first quarter of Boston's 111-103 Game 3 win. Asked to guess the outcome of the situation, Jackson replied, "Well, this should not be a guess."
"The rule here is very clear," Jackson said, "and it's a very bright line, albeit that you're making a decision on a very key player in this playoff series. And for that reason it makes it difficult but the league office is supported by the rules that all the teams and all the players are very aware of. And in my mind, they will get suspended for one game."
After the game, Thomas said they did not fear any additional punishment because they did not mean to hit Schroder. Jackson believes the Celtics point guard's explanation may not sway the NBA league office.
"I hear what Isaiah is saying," Jackson said. "At the same time, if you look where the incident took place on the floor, in transition, it's rare for a player to stop at that point on the floor, extend their hand and swing and make contact with a player. So if you're waving to somebody in the crowd or a teammate, or motioning to a coach, I think that that reasoning doesn't really hold water for me. So again, I think they'll look at this. This is really tough. The fact that Isaiah is trying to absolve themselves of any culpability here is not unusual. It's unfortunate that it happened and the contact wasn't severe, but it did happen and the rule is clear that they swung and in this case made contact with the player and should be suspended."
Jackson said the NBA will "review the game in its entirety" and likely "conduct an investigation by talking to both of the players and the officiating crew on the staff, and they'll arrive at a decision before the next game as to whether or not the player will be suspended."
"I can't predict what the outcome will be although when you look at the play, it clearly is not a basketball play," said Jackson. "There's no reason for Isaiah Thomas to extend their arm, swing it and make contact with Schroder's head in that situation, and the rule on this is very clear: if a player swings with an open hand or a closed fist -- whether or not they make contact or not -- two things are supposed to happen. One is the player's supposed to be ejected from the game, and then secondly the player is subject to an automatic one-game suspension. Now you do have some cases where the referee doesn't see the play during the game, but upon postgame review the player would be automatically suspended."
Jackson's comments and Thomas' contact to Schroder's head can be seen in the video above. The Celtics needed a career-high 42 points from Thomas to take Game 3 and pull within 2-1 in the series, and would be in serious danger without their star scorer.
SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Australia and Singapore have agreed to jointly develop military training areas and facilities in Australia in a sign of how China's increasingly assertive military presence in the region is encouraging nations to boost their own defense capabilities.

Singapore will fund a A$2.25 billion (US$1.7 billion) expansion of military training facilities in Australia, a government source told Reuters.
Singapore will have enhanced and expanded military training access in Australia over a period of 25 years. The two will strengthen intelligence and information sharing, such as in counter-terrorism, the city-state's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Friday.
The move to forge closer military ties between Australia and Singapore comes at a time of rising tensions between much of Asia and China, which has been building military and civilian facilities on its artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea.
“The kind of military relationships that (Singapore) have and types of military ties that they are developing and deepening, they don't have with China,” said Richard Bitzinger, a security expert at the S.Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.
“I am not saying that this is being done overtly to deal with China, but I wouldn't be surprised if that isn't a major driver behind this.”
The region is also facing rising risks from Islamic extremists. Earlier this week, Singapore said it had detained eight Bangladeshi men who were planning attacks in their homeland. It deported five others who were arrested by police in Dhaka.
Land-scarce Singapore has long sent troops to Australia for military exercises. The new deal would allow the Asian nation to increase the number of troops it has on rotation in Australia to 14,000, from 6,000.
Under the agreement, Singapore would fund the cost of expanding the Shoalwater Bay Training Area and the Townsville Field Training Area, both in the north of Queensland state.
Both bases lie in electorates critical to the government. The timing of the agreement is viewed as a political coup for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ahead of an anticipated July federal election.
“Under our comprehensive strategic partnership, our aim is to elevate our relationship to a level similar to the one we enjoy with New Zealand,” Turnbull told reporters in Canberra.
They said the new partnership will also generate a construction boom in North Queensland due to the need for roads, accommodation and facilities for the Singaporean Defence forces.
The agreement makes Singapore the only other foreign country to invest in military infrastructure in Australia besides the United States.
Earlier this week Reuters reported that Singapore will soon pick the winner of a $1 billion tender for military utility helicopters, as it modernizes its air force and navy amid rising tensions in the region.
The city-state and Australia also updated a free trade agreement, which includes improved access for businesses to bid for government procurement contracts and allowed for easier movement of people between the two markets.
Singapore is Australia's fifth largest trading and investment partner, with bilateral trade of S$20.2 billion ($14.86 billion) in 2015. The city-state has investments amounting to A$80.2 billion in Australia.
An Illinois man has accused Bose, the audio equipment manufacturer, of illegally wiretapping them via their Bose headphones.
According to a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in Chicago on Tuesday, Kyle Zak bought a $350 (£330) pair of Bose QuietComfort 35 wireless Bluetooth headphones in March 2017. Those headphones use an app, known as "Bose Connect," to skip, pause, and perform other controls on them.
The civil complaint alleges that Bose collects "the names of any music and audio tracks" played through the headphones, along with the customer's personally identifiable serial number. It also says the information gets sent to third parties, including "data miner Segment.io."
Lawyers for Zak argue that this constitutes wiretapping. They further allege that this type of interception could have revealed a lot of personal information about consumers, depending on their music or podcasting listening habits. For example, someone listening to "The Greatest Generation," like its hosts, might be a little bit embarrassed to admit to the world that they listen to a Star Trek podcast.
Neither Bose nor Segment.io, which is not a party to the lawsuit, immediately responded to Ars' request for comment.
The lawsuit claims that several other headphone models send out this data, including the SoundSport Wireless, Sound Sport Pulse Wireless, QuietControl 30, SoundLink Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II, and SoundLink Color II.
Metadata vs. content
Zak and their lawyers from Edelson , a Chicago-based law firm that specializes in technology and privacy cases, will have to show that the interception of the audio metadata is the same thing as the content contemplated by federal wiretap law.
"We discovered the issue, as we do in many of our cases, through an investigation conducted by our in-house computer forensics lab," Christopher Dore, one of the Edelson lawyers involved in the case, e-mailed Ars.
Bose lawyers likely will argue that while it may be sending out copies of the metadata (artist, song title, etc.), its actions do not constitute "contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication" as defined under the relevant wiretap law. Therefore, it could argue, the company isn't liable.
Edelson seems to have anticipated this line of argument and points out that the Bose products interact with consumer smartphones, which transmit "operational instructions regarding skipping and rewinding audio tracks and their corresponding titles."
We really commend Matthew Weiner & Co. for placing so much importance on the finer details in Mad Men, but even a crack team can make mistakes. On Sunday's episode Don Draper brought a cake to Rachel Menken's shiva, and it came in a pink box. There was some discussion over whether or not this is accurate, because apparently pink boxes are a West Coast thing.
@BoweryBoys I think it's another West Coast mistake. Cake boxes out east aren't pink. Common TV mixup. Unexpected on Mad Men. — cjstephens (@cjstephens) April 6, 2015
To be clear, we don't really care if the box Don was carrying was historically accurate, but we decided to investigate anyway, since we had never heard of this regional pink box thing.
First we reached out the NYPL, asking for any information on pink bakery boxes in New York City. Rebecca Federman, the culinary librarian, was unable to find anything regarding pink bakery boxes in New York during their initial search. Currently they are checking some journals, and we'll update if they find anything, specifically when the first pink bakery box was used here.
Next up, we contacted the Mad Men team, because there was writing on the box Don was carrying, which was not legible, but given their attention to detail must have had the name of an actual bakery on it. And it did. This morning we were told that "Prop Master Ellen Freund chose Glaser's Bake Shop in New York as the place the pink box was from. Glaser's has been open since 1902 and still open today located at 1670 First Avenue at 87th Street."
(Courtesy of Glaser's)
We called Glaser's to find out if they ever had pink boxes. We were told no, they've only ever had white boxes, and the only time these boxes were even slightly changed was when they briefly added green writing. Glaser's has always had, and still has, white boxes only.
This seems to be a common mistake in Hollywood, where the Pepto-hued boxes have been around for a long time. In an old issue of LA Magazine, it was pointed out that the pink boxes are "not a tribute to Angelyne. Cambodians fleeing the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s arrived in large numbers in Southern California, where they were recruited by Win-chell's. At the time the coated, greaseproof boxes that held the pastries were costly and came in white, the color of mourning in Cambodia. So the immigrants found a company, Evergreen in Cerritos, that made the boxes cheaper and uncoated in pink."
Of course, the pink box has made its way to bakeries all over the world at this point, and are frequently found holding cupcakes here in New York today.
The Venezuelan government has responded to opposition and private media accusations that it is being “mysterious” regarding information on Chavez's health situation, and has called such statements as well as rumours being spread on social networks “psychological warfare”.
“The government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela warns the Venezuelan public of a campaign of psychological warfare unleashed by the international media regarding the health of the head of state," said Ernesto Villegas, minister for communication on January 3 as they read out the government statement in a national broadcast.
"This campaign aims ultimately to destabilise the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ignore the popular will expressed in the presidential elections last October 7, and end the Bolivarian Revolution led by Chavez.”
International solidarity: Photos of people around the world with "Yo Soy Chavez" (I am Chavez) signs.
Vice-president Nicolas Maduro also asked the people of Venezuela to “trust the national authorities, who are more united than ever”. They said that since Chavez's operation for reoccurring cancer in Cuba on December 11, the government has released 26 official statements informing the public about the state of Chavez's health and “always tells the truth”.
Maduro specifically accused Ramon Aveledo, executive secretary of the opposition umbrella group, the Roundtable for Democratic Unity (MUD), of being behind the rumour campaigns that have been started through social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.
"It is essential that the government act in a manner that gives confidence," Aveledo told a news conference. "The official version hides more information than it gives.”
International media
Several international mass media outlets, including The Australian and the BBC have used Aveledo's press conference to publish headlines casting doubt on the Venezuelan government, such as, “Venezuelan opposition demands ‘truth' on Chavez health”, and the Washington Post headlined with “Venezuelans demand answers on Chavez's health”.
The Australian, using an AAP article, and The LA times quoted Aveledo to say that the “Venezuelan constitution calls for new elections within 30 days if the president-elect is unable to take the oath of office”.
However, the 30 day period for new elections only applies if the president is made permanently unavailable, which the constitution defines as death, or permanent incapacitating illness.
Reflecting the statements being made by the Venezuelan opposition, US State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said on Janauary 2: “We don't have any way to evaluate what's being said, but we have seen concern within Venezuela that the government's not being transparent.”
Further, opposition leader and mayor of Caracas Metropolitan District, Antonio Ledezma, said on January 3 that they were proposing that a commission be sent to Cuba to “verify president Hugo Chavez's state of health” and said that such a commission should be made up of themselves and two other opposition leaders, Henrique Capriles and Henri Falcon, as well as “professionally reliable and morally recognised doctors”.
“I'm not asking permission to go to Cuba, I think we have the right to go there and see what is happening, we should go and that's it," they said. "Enough of the mystery, Venezuela isn't a Cuban colony.”
They also repeated their own suggestions made a few months ago that Chavez should renounce their position. “The president should separate themselves from their position and dedicated themselves to recovering from the illness that they have had for over 18 months,” they said.
An unknown person also created a Twitter account which falsely claimed to be run by Chavez's daughter, Rosa Virgina Chavez, who is with their father in Cuba. The account gave false information about Chavez's state of health
Speculation and misrepresentations
Spain's ABC reported on December 31 that president Chavez “has entered into an induced coma, with their vital signs very low, maintained by artificial assistance... sources consulted by the ABC assured on Monday that a disconnection from artificial assistance had been scheduled...this disconnection, with the foreseeable result of death, could happen at any time”.
The article further claimed that “almost half a metre of their intestine has been extracted” and that Chavez hasn't eaten solid food since.
The ABC also speculated that Venezuelan government officials “seem to be preparing the country for the news of their [Chavez's] death”.
The report was reposted and copied by other mainstream media sources, and follows an earlier report by the ABC, in late December, claiming that “Chavez had a tracheotomy” and was on “artificial respiration”.
Maduro referred to the reports put out by Spain's ABC as “Francoist”.
The government's January 3 statement assured: “Following delicate surgery on December 11, Comandante Chavez has faced complications as a result of a severe respiratory infection. This infection has led to respiratory deficiency that requires Chavez to remain in strict compliance with their medical treatment.”
“The government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates its confidence in the medical team that is attending to the president and that has permanently monitored their clinical evolution and acted with the most absolute rigorousness in the face of each one of the difficulties presented.”

Howeve­r, senior offici­al dismis­ses report­s, says Salman will not relinq­uish throne­
Saudi monarch King Salman is set to step down and announce their son Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman as their successor next week, sources said.
The 81-year-old king will continue as a ceremonial figurehead, handing over official leadership of the country to their son — often referred to as MBS, the Daily Mail quoted royal sources as saying.
The move is seen as the final step in the 32-year-old bin Salman's power grab, which began earlier this month with the arrests of over 40 princes and government ministers in a corruption probe.
“Unless something dramatic happens, King Salman will announce the appointment of MBS as King of Saudi Arabia next week,” the sources said. “King Salman will play the role of the queen of England. They will only keep the title ‘Custodian of the Holy Shrines'.”
The source went on to claim that once crowned king, the prince will shift their focus to Iran, a long standing rival oil empire to Saudi Arabia in the Middle East, with fears military action is possible. They will also enlist the help of the Israeli military to crush Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia supported by Iran, according to the source.
“MBS is convinced that they have to hit Iran and Hezbollah,” they said. “Contrary to the advice of the royal family elders, that's MBS's next target. Hence why the ruler of Kuwait privately calls them ‘The raging Bull'.”
“MBS's plan is to start the fire in Lebanon, but he's hoping to count on Israeli military backing. They have already promised Israel billions of dollars in direct financial aid if they agree. MBS cannot confront Hezbollah in Lebanon without Israel. Plan B is to fight Hezbollah in Syria,' said the source.
Tensions have been rising between Saudi Arabia and Iran after the Saudi government blamed Iran for a foiled missile attack near Riyadh on November 4. The rocket was fired from neighboring Yemen and was heading towards the Saudi capital before it was shot down. The Saudi foreign minister, Adel Jubair, said Iran was responsible and called the attack ‘an act of war'.
‘Salman not to relinquish throne'
Meanwhile, another senior Saudi official dismissed the mounting speculation that the crown prince will soon ascend to the throne. “There is no possibility whatsoever that the king will abdicate,” Bloomberg quoted the unnamed official as saying.
Saudi kings usually stay in power even when bad health prevents them from carrying out their job, the official said on condition of anonymity. They noted the example of King Fahd, who stayed on as monarch until their death in 2005 despite being gravely ill in the last few years of their reign.

Last year, novelist Sergio De La Pava compared the American criminal justice system to the strange physics concept of naked singularities. That inspired me to ask the author of Sci Am‘s article on the concept, theoretical physicist Pankaj Joshi of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai (right in photo), for an update. Watch their lecture on YouTube, too.
Imagine a black hole without the “black” part. That is, imagine a black hole that you could fall into and, with effort, escape back out, as long as you didn't hit the very center of the hole–its so-called spacetime singularity–and get crushed into oblivion. In other words, imagine a black hole without its outer perimeter (its so-called event horizon) but with its central singularity. That's what physicists and cosmologists call a naked singularity.
It would be a strange beast, like a star so tiny you could hold it in your hand–although you would definitely not want to do that. The thing can have the mass of an entire star (or more) compressed into something approaching a mathematical point. Close to it, the energy densities, spacetime curvatures, and all other physical quantities would become arbitrarily large. Extreme physics would govern the happenings there.
Can naked singularities really form in nature, or does the collapse of a massive star always produce an event horizon? Roger Penrose (left in photo above) famously suggested that they cannot form. But later studies showed they do form under physically reasonable conditions, as I discussed in a Scientific American article several years ago. This is one of the most hotly debated frontier issues in modern black hole physics and relativistic astrophysics today.
Because Einstein's theory of gravity allows for both black holes and naked singularities, it's up to observers to settle the question. But how would a naked singularity distinguish itself from a clothed one? Singularities generally come in two types: those which are like events and others which are like objects. The big bang is an event-like singularity; a black hole is like an object. Both types can be produced as end state of gravitational collapse, depending on variables such as how fast or slow the collapse is, how the shells of matter fall in, and what the internal structure of the matter cloud is. A catastrophic collapse, such as a massive star imploding in matter of seconds, will produce an event-like naked singularity. A slower collapse could produce an object-like one.
When a naked singularity is event-like, it looks like an explosion. As the star collapses, it eventually rebounds because of quantum gravitational effects. In this case, observers need to look for an otherwise inexplicable outburst of energy.
When a naked singularity is objectlike, it looks rather like a black hole unclothed by a horizon (hence the name). A swirling disk of matter would form around it, and my colleagues and I recently showed that the disk would be much brighter than the equivalent around a black hole. It would also differentiate itself by its light spectrum, by the higher efficiency of particle collisions in its vicinity, and by the way it bends light.
Those of an adventurous frame of mind might imagine boarding a starship and plunging into a naked singularity. The descent would be rather different than the same trip into a black hole. For the black hole case, as kamikaze astronauts near the event horizon, the light they emit gets dimmer and dimmer, eventually going beyond any observable limit. In the naked singularity case, the light rays could escape from an arbitrary vicinity of the singularity. The astronauts would be able to remain in radio contact all the way down and send back direct pictures of quantum gravitational effects.
If you point a camera straight a black hole, you will see only inky blackness. If you point one at a naked singularity, you will see a small but bright object, albeit one with an unusual spectrum of light. Technically, you do not see the singularity itself, but its immediate environs. The astronauts would be able to say, “Ah, that's how physics is unified,” and inform their friends back home of their achievement. They might even live to tell the tale.

Wikimedia started batting around the idea of suing the NSA with the ACLU last year following Edward Snowden's disclosures about the scale of the surveillance. It's specifically challenging the "upstream" spying that taps the internet's backbone and picks up all communications, including those by "non-US persons." By casting such a wide net, "the NSA is straining the backbone of democracy," according to the organization. It added that the spy agency massively overstepped the FAA limits by monitoring "people, platforms and infrastructure with little regard for probably cause or proportionality."
By casting such a wide net, "the NSA is straining the backbone of democracy."
The 2013 Snowden leaks showed that the NSA specifically targeted the Wikipedia online encyclopedia and it's half-billion users. Parent Wikimedia said that gives it "standing" to file a suit, since the foundation and its users suffered harm -- unlike a previous Amnesty International case that was dismissed for lack of a direct link. The foundation said that specific details of the final complaint will be forthcoming once the suit has been filed. On top of the Wikimedia suit, the NSA is also battling a complaint from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

As an organizing structure, family has always had its costs and benefits. It provides love and support. But it also encourages nepotism and tribalism. We tend to put our family's well-being above that of society's. Perhaps the reality of One Big Family will tip the balance toward the good.
I understand the privacy concern. But like it or not, the transparency train isn't slowing down. Births and deaths are public records.
And for the vast majority of us cousins, I don't foresee much harmful fallout from semi-public family trees, especially since the first names of living relatives usually remain hidden. These trees are exposing the names of uncles and aunts, not credit cards numbers and passwords. Mr. Schoenberg argues that many of us suffer from “narcissistic paranoia.” The world overflows with so much data, no one really cares who your sister is.
Another big problem: accuracy. Like Wikipedia, the shared websites allow collaborators to edit your family tree. Geni has more than eight million users, and about 120 volunteer curators. Mistakes can creep in. Documentation is sometimes still sparse. The tree's accuracy will, I think, improve as more evidence is added. But it will never be perfect. Some avant-garde genealogists call their practice “quantum genealogy.” Traditional genealogists demand rigorous proof of every relationship, but the new, less cautious genealogists argue that we have to work with probabilities. We may never know for sure that X is Y's uncle, but we can make educated guesses. (I think both types of genealogy have their place.)
The farther you go back, the more quantum it gets. According to Geni, my 97th great-grandfather is King David from the Bible. So what are the chances that I'm actually a direct descendant of the Goliath slayer? Count me a highly doubting Thomas. But it's still fun to dive into the research and try to verify it.
In addition to using crowd-sourced trees, I'm trying to build my family list with genetic testing. I recently sent my saliva off to 23andMe (the F.D.A. has suspended the health-related part of 23andMe, but the ancestry service remains open). The result? I found more than a thousand fellow spitters who share enough genetic material that 23andMe says we are probable cousins. One such distant cousin: my wife. This was a tad jarring. Not to mention that it set off an avalanche of bad inbreeding and hillbilly jokes from friends. But the truth is, my wife and I aren't unusual.
And that means, my cousin, you're invited to a little get-together I'm planning: the mother of all family reunions. Next year, thousands of my relatives — from first cousins to 26th cousins — will, I hope, gather to eat some barbecued chicken, play tug of war and debate the meaning of family in this era of the global village. It's my admittedly quixotic dream that when we realize that we're all related, we'll treat one another with more civility.
Watching Tigers games on television is fun and all, but for high energy and raw excitement during those big game moments, it's tough to beat Dan Dickerson and their radio play-by-play. Here are ten fantastic moments from the first half of the 2014 season, as relayed by this generation's Ernie Harwell.
10. Gonzalez walks-off on Opening Day (vs The Royals)
Remember Alex Gonzalez, that one dude who played for the Tigers for about nine games at the beginning of the year? Chances are, if you do remember him, this is a big reason why: with Tyler Collins standing at second base and one out in a 3-3 tie, Gonzalez hit this walk-off single on Opening Day to give the Tigers the win.

9. Kinsler walks-off - April 1 (vs The Royals)
Not to be out-done by Gonzalez, Ian Kinsler stepped to the plate in the tenth inning of the Tigers' second game of the season, with Austin Jackson standing on second base and two outs in a 1-1 tie ... it took the Tigers until June of 2013 to get their first walk-off win, and now here they were in 2014, just two games into the season, already with two walk-off wins under their belts.

8. VMart's 10th-inning go-ahead homer - April 9 (vs The Dodgers)
After Joe Nathan blew a 6-3 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning by letting the Dodgers tie the game, the Tigers went into the tenth to face elite closer Kenley Jansen (he of the 98- and 99-MPH fastball). Leading off the inning, Victor Martinez worked a 2-2 count, and then did what they would continue to do for the rest of the first half ...

7. Tigers tie the game on a WTF play - April 20 (vs The Angels)
Bottom of the first inning, Tigers behind 1-0, one out, and Ian Kinsler standing at first base. Miguel Cabrera drew a walk that somehow escalated into ... well, how do you describe this? In the official score book, it looked like E2/E8/E1, if that helps.

6. Catchers have strong butts - April 22 (vs The White Sox)
Alright, technically this isn't a "play," but it was still one of my favorite moments of the first half. Alex Avila almost got hit by a pitch, which led Jim Price to make a rather strange pronouncement. Dan Dickerson's stunned silence is beautiful.

5. Holaday bunts in the go-ahead run - April 29 (vs The White Sox)
After clawing back from a 3-1 deficit in the sixth inning, the Tigers tied the game at 3-3. With the game still tied in the top of the ninth inning, Ronald Belisario struck out Torii Hunter, but then saw Austin Jackson reach third base on a field error in right field. They then struck out Nick Castellanos, and with two outs, only had to get past Bryan Holaday to keep the game tied. On a 1-1 pitch, Holaday pulled off a minor miracle.

4. Don Kelly robs a home run - May 10 (vs The Twins)
In the top of the first inning, Kurt Suzuki made a legitimate bid at a home run to left field, but Don Kelly, normally against immoral things such as robbery, made an exception - and a fantastic play - in this case.

3. Miggy hits the go-ahead three-run bomb in the 9th - May 13 (vs The Orioles)
Things weren't looking good for the Tigers. Down 1-0, the offense had done nothing all game long, and now it was the top of the ninth. Tommy Hunter gave up a lead-off single to Alex Avila, and we were all looking at the lineup card, hoping that somehow Miguel Cabrera could get to the plate. Rajai Davis came in to pinch-run for Avila, and was called out trying to steal second - thankfully, Brad Ausmus challenged the call, and it was overturned.
Don Kelly and Ian Kinsler both promptly lined out, and the Tigers were down to their final out with the tying run at second, and Torii Hunter at the plate. Somehow, Torii did what they almost never does, and worked a full-count walk, which brought Miggy to the plate.

2. VMart's epic at-bat ends with a blast - May 30 (vs The Mariners)
In a battle for the ages, Victor Martinez faced off against Hisashi Iwakuma in the top of the fifth inning with the score tied 2-2. With two outs and runners at first and second, Martinez proceeded to lock horns with Iwakuma for a ten pitch at-bat, fouling off pitches left and right, working the count to 2-2. It brought back memories of Dave Bergman's battle-to-the-finish in 1984 against Roy Lee Jackson, and it ended in the same way.

1. Rajai Davis and the Ultimate Slam - June 30 (vs The's)
Of course we had to save the best for last. Bottom of the ninth, down 4-1, facing the nearly-unhittable Sean Doolittle and their ridiculous 56-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio, the Tigers did the unthinkable. Nick Castellanos squeaked out an infield hit, and Alex Avila followed with a base hit of their own. Eugenio Suarez struck out, and Doolittle looked like they might have gotten things back under control. And then they walked Austin Jackson to load the bases, with Rajai Davis and their killer numbers against left-handed pitchers coming to the plate.

Bonus call: Verlander gets their first career hit - April 12 (vs The Padres)
It's impossible to leave this one out. We waited for what seemed like forever to see this happen. In the top of the second inning, facing Ian Kennedy, Justin Verlander took their first at-bat of the season, still looking for their first career base hit. To the delight of everyone in the Tigers dugout and in the Tigers fanbase, they got what they were looking for.
FAITH & REASON FAITH & REASON Blog: Join the conversation on religion, spirituality and ethics | Forum: Debate fellow readers BALTIMORE  Ten Maryland nuns — almost an entire religious community — converted from the Episcopal Church to Catholicism on Thursday, saying their former denomination had become too liberal in its acceptance of homosexuality. The ten members of the All Saints Sisters of the Poor, who were received into the Catholic Church by Baltimore Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, will continue to live with two nuns who decided not to convert at their convent in Catonsville, Md. The community's chaplain, the Rev. Warren Tanghe, also converted on Thursday with the nuns. FAITH & REASON: Episcopal dioceses quick to list gay nominees for bishop "Our archdiocese and our church's mission of caring for the poor are now greatly enriched for having the All Saints Sisters among us," O'Brien said in a statement. Members of the order had been considering conversion for seven years. Mother Christina Christie, superior of the order, told the Baltimore Sun: "We were drifting farther apart from the more liberal road the Episcopal Church is traveling. We are now more at home in the Roman Catholic Church." By allowing gay bishops and blessings for same-sex relationships, the Episcopal Church is "way off the boat," Christie said. Dozens of parishes and the majority of four dioceses have split from the Episcopal Church since it consecrated an openly gay man as bishop of New Hampshire in 2003. The church lifted a de facto ban on consecrating more gay bishops at its General Convention in July. The All Saints order, whose members wear traditional black habits and white wimples covering their heads, was founded in England and came to Baltimore in 1872. Episcopal Bishop of Maryland Eugene Sutton said in a statement that "despite the sadness we feel in having to say farewell, our mutual joy is that we remain as one spiritual family of faith, one body in Christ."

Last Thursday morning, the Facebook page for downtown Dallas' Serj Books announced that the bookstore and coffee shop was closed for the summer.
"Do not look for us," the message said. "September is just days away. We love you all. Respect."
There may have been a reason the shop's owner, John Walsh, didn't want anybody looking for him.

Since May 21, Dallas police have arrested Walsh on three occasions for four offenses, culminating in an arrest for aggravated sexual assault Thursday night. While little information is available about the alleged sexual assault — DPD policies restrict public access to police reports regarding sex crimes — arrest warrant affidavits from the two May incidents paint a picture of a man struggling.
Shortly after 2 a.m. May 21, Dallas Fire and Rescue personnel called Dallas police after Walsh became belligerent as they attempted to treat them after a car accident. When the police showed up, they found Walsh "yelling and cursing" at paramedics just outside the parking garage at the 1001 Ross apartment complex.
Witnesses told police they found Walsh passed out behind the wheel of their still-running 2012 BMW, which he'd crashed into the apartment complex's garage gate. After being woken up, witnesses told police, Walsh reversed their car off the garage ramp, drove around the parking lot, and parked across the street from the garage. When paramedics showed up and tried to treat Walsh, witnesses said, they drove their car back into the parking garage and removed their temporary license plates. Police later linked Walsh to the car through its vehicle identification number.
As police investigated the crash, Walsh alternated between shouting that they would kill the officers and crying and asking for sympathy, according to the affidavit. Officers, who felt they had "lost the normal use of their mental and physical faculties due to the introduction of alcohol and/or dangerous drugs into their body," arrested Walsh, who told them he'd had nothing to drink except a few beers, which they didn't consider alcohol.
Police took Walsh to Baylor University Medical Center to have their blood drawn. Walsh paid their $500 bail and was released.
Six days later, Target employees called police after Walsh became irate while trying to return merchandise without a receipt. When an employee refused, Walsh said that "he had a gun and they wanted their fucking money," according to police. When a loss-prevention employee at the store told them to lower their voice, Walsh said, "I have a loaded gun and I will shoot you if you don't step back," before placing their hand on the small of their back as if they have a gun tucked into their waistband.
As Walsh left the Haskell Avenue store's parking lot in their car, they threatened to shoot or harm several more people, at one point getting out of their car and pretending to get a gun out and place it in their waistband. Police arrested Walsh and charged them with two counts of making terroristic threats, a Class B misdemeanor. Walsh paid their $1,500 bail and got out of jail.
The coup de grâce for Serj came at about 12:30 p.m. Thursday from a woman who told police that Walsh sexually assaulted them in downtown Dallas. Police took the woman to Presbyterian hospital for an examination but are not releasing any more information about the incident. Walsh's bail is $100,000, and they remain in Dallas County Jail.
Gary Casteel, UAW, calls on Volkswagen to enter into collective bargaining with democratically elected union at plant in Chattanooga, TN, Frankfurt, Germany, 26 May 2016
The meeting, gathering more than 200 union representatives from all over the world, took place on 25-26 May at the Frankfurt headquarters of IG Metall, German affiliate of IndustriALL Global Union.
The German auto giant is refusing to bargain with skilled trades workers at the Chattanooga plant who voted in December to choose IndustriALL affiliate, the United Auto Workers (UAW), as their exclusive representative for collective bargaining. Not only does Volkswagen's refusal to bargain violate US law, it also infringes the company's global framework agreement (GFA) with IndustriALL, as well as international labour standards.
IG Metall president Jörg Hofmann said:
“It is not acceptable that companies abide by the law in Germany but disregard it in other countries. Workers' rights should be respected worldwide – particularly by companies headquartered in Germany.”
UAW's secretary-treasurer Gary Casteel told the Executive Committee:
"There is a cartel of capitalists in the South of the USA working in cohesion with right wing groups and antiunion lawyers. The tricks and tactics in the south of the US won't remain there – they will be coming to you soon.”
The Executive Committee unanimously passed the resolution that calls on Volkswagen to immediately begin negotiations with the skilled trades workers at Chattanooga.
The resolution also says that if Volkswagen has not formally agreed to begin collective bargaining with the workers by 22 June, IndustriALL shall initiate further actions, which could lead to the eventual revocation of the GFA between IndustriALL and Volkswagen.
It's a long-standing tradition: What's revealed to a priest in the sacrament of confession cannot be repeated or shared with anyone else. They call it the Seal of Confession. Up until recently, the law accepted this as moral and desirable.
But that tradition has now been called into question and the Supreme Court may end up ruling on it.
The Diocese of Baton Rouge has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a decision by the State of Louisiana Supreme Court, in which local priest Father Jeff Bayhi was punished for failing to report the sexual abuse of one of their young female parishioners, which the child in question allegedly disclosed during a confession in 2008. The abuser (another parishioner, not a priest) is now dead, but the girl's parents have sued them — as well as Father Bayhi and the Diocese of Baton Rouge — for the priest's failure to report the abuse to authorities, as per the state's mandatory reporting laws. The family alleges that Bayhi's silence allowed the abuse to continue until the abuser died.
The Louisiana Supreme Court's decision gives some of the case's history. Before the initial trial began, the Church filed a motion to keep any mention of these confessions out of the trial. The lower court dismissed this motion; the teenager held privilege and was entitled to waive it if they wanted. The appellate court reversed this decision, finding that Bayhi was not legally required to report the abuse because the Seal of the Confessional is legally protected by confidentiality laws.
The state Supreme Court was asked to determine whether Bayhi could be compelled to reveal whether or not their young parishioner came to them in confession and what (if anything) they confessed. The justices determined that the girl had the right to waive their confidentiality privileges, meaning the Church could not keep their testimony out of the trial if they wanted to speak. Nor could the priest cite confidentiality as a reason to not testify once the girl themselves had waived the privilege.
Moreover, the court noted that a clergyperson has a mandatory duty to report any suspicious interactions they observed outside of the confessional, as well as reports of abuse or criminal activity gained through pastoral counseling or spiritual direction, where confidentiality has limits. Priests can also ask the penitent to repeat the information outside of the confessional, freeing themselves to report. The decision argued that Bayhi's behavior should be examined in a court of law, not presumed legal and dismissed out of hand.
Church law does not allow either the plaintiff (penitent) or anyone else to waive the seal of confession… This matter is of serious consequence for all religions, not just the Catholic faith. The statutes involved in this matter address ‘sacred communications' which are confidential and are exempt from mandatory reporting. For a civil court to impinge upon the freedom of religion is a clear violation and the matter will be taken to the highest court in the land by the church in order to protect its free exercise of religion.
Needless to say, the Church didn't like that. The Baton Rouge Diocese chose to respond by playing the same old, shabby, overplayed religious freedom card. And, as usual, that involves placing the laws of the Church above the laws of the land and the rights of actual people:
The Diocese of Baton Rouge almost certainly moved to exclude all mention of the confession from the trial to protect its reputation. This may be related to the Church's flourishing reputation as an institution that protects abusers, or it may just be because Bayhi was so callous in their advice about the abuse. The Court reports that, according to the teenager's deposition, Bayhi told them “she needed to handle the situation herself” and advised them to “sweep it under the floor and get rid of it.”
The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests issued a statement in which it pointed out the Church's shoddy track record on abuse reporting and reminded readers that, in past cases, Catholic officials have falsely claimed that reportable conversations with young parishioners were confessions in order to get around mandatory reporting laws. While they profess to “hope that is not the case here,” the director of SNAP pointed out,
This is what happens when Catholic officials conceal child sex crimes for decades — they lose credibility among judges. And this is what happens when Catholic officials deliberately and deceptively exploit confessional confidentiality.

Three men, named Tupac, Robin Williams and Erick Harris, were arrested in Payson, Arizona on suspicion of possessing nearly $70,000 of marijuana.Authorities said the oddly-named trio, all from Albuquerque, New Mexico, were stopped on Sunday along State Route 87, near Payson, Arizona. An Arizona Department of Public Safety trooper pulled over the white Chevrolet pick-up truck for traffic violations.During the stop, the trooper noticed signs of criminal activity and called for a K-9 officer to come investigate. With the help of the K-9, authorities found a tool box and equipment box in the bed of the truck that were hiding a total of five large plastic wrapped packages containing pot.The packages weighed almost 115 pounds and had a street value of nearly $70,000, according to the department.Tupac Crum, 19, Williams 21, and Harris, 22, were all arrested and booked into the Gila County jail on suspicion of several drug offenses.The investigation was ongoing.
A Virginia Muslim woman says they were fired from their job at a dental clinic for refusing to take off their hijab (head scarf), saying that their employer told them they wanted to keep the office “neutral” and that their garment might offend patients, The Independent is reporting.
Najaf Khan said they didn't wear their hijab when they went for their job interview at Fair Oaks Dental Care Clinic, nor did they wear it on their first two days on the job. But on the third day, they decided to wear it – a decision they would come to regret.
Faith is important enough to display once they have the job but not during the process of applying for it? #NajafKhan https://t.co/lWu1HYnSTQ — glenda lahaye (@jerinsmommacita) August 5, 2016
“I didn't think it was going to be a big issue. I was completely aware they might ask me, but I didn't know it would come down to the fact that if I wear it, I can't work there.”
Khan says their firing was even more surprising considering that they had been getting positive performance reviews up until the point they were fired.
“I was astonished because they had been saying I was doing so well. I received an email the Friday morning saying how much positive enthusiasm I was bringing to the dental office.”
The hijab, or head scarf, is a traditional head covering worn by some Muslim women as a sign of modesty. In much the same way that some Jews keep Kosher while others do not, or some Catholics eschew meaton Fridays while others do not, not all Muslim women wear the hijab (or wear it all the time). Whether or not Islam requires Muslim women to wear the hijab at all times is a matter of debate in the Muslim community.
Muslim women wearing the traditional hijab. [Image via Shutterstock/Amir Ridhwan] The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) has taken up Ms. Khan's case. In a statement, National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper called on Khan's employer to give them their old job back.
“No employee should face termination because of their or their faith or religious practices. We call on Fair Oaks Dental Care to reinstate the Muslim employee and to offer their reasonable religious accommodation as mandated by law.”
At this point it bears noting that, as of this writing, Fair Oaks Dental Care Clinic has not responded to requests for comment, so we only have Khan's side of the story. UPDATE: Fair Oaks Dental Care Clinic has responded, on the clinic's Facebook page.
“We only asked Ms. Khan to wear a separate clean hijab (office worn only) or wear a sanitary head cover over their hijab while seeing patients in the office just like we require all employees to wear scrubs and not street clothes in the office when treating patients. Ms. Khan did not find this suitable and they then walked out on their own accord.”
So if Ms. Khan's version of events is true, do they have a leg to stand on, legally? Maybe.
According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, federal law prohibits employers with 15 or more employees from discriminating against employees on the basis of religion (it is not clear how many employees work at Fair Oaks Dental Care Clinic).
“[The law] protects all aspects of religious observance, practice, and belief, and defines religion very broadly to include not only traditional, organized religions such as Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, but also religious beliefs that are new, uncommon, not part of a formal church or sect, only subscribed to by a small number of people, or may seem illogical or unreasonable to others.”
That means an employer must make “reasonable accommodation” when it comes to employees of different religious beliefs. Just what “reasonable accommodation” actually means, though, is handled largely on a case-by-case basis.
And Khan may have the Supreme Court on their side. In 2015, the Court sided with a different Muslim woman, Samantha Elauf, who wasn't hired at Abercrombie & Fitch because they wore a hijab.
Do you think Fair Oaks Dental Care Clinic was within its rights to fire Najaf Khan for not taking off their hijab when asked?

Saturday Morning Post: The Weekly View from Washington
An already-turbulent Republican presidential contest seemed poised to fly apart on Friday. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, now just edging Donald Trump for the polling lead in the race, melted under the new glare. In the space of a week, they insisted, despite reports suggesting otherwise, that as a kid they had in fact tried to attack their mother with a hammer and stab someone, and that any attempt to deny those stories amounted to a “smear” (huh?); stood by their contention that the Egyptian pyramids were built by the Biblical figure Joseph for grain storage rather than interring pharaohs; and then, Friday, after a bizarrely churlish CNN interview, found themselves in a firestorm over whether they lied about receiving a scholarship offer from West Point.
It may be that early-state voters are looking for a violent juvenile sociopath who mellowed into an armchair Egyptologist. Or, likelier, a crowded field is growing more unstable as the first events on the primary calendar swing into view.
Lost somewhere in the contest's bulging middle tier is Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO who vaulted into serious contention after a pair of standout debate performances. But they collapsed as quickly as they rose without so much as offering a theory about a treasure map on the back of the Constitution. What happened? One explanation, from veteran political handicapper Stu Rothenberg: In a race stratified between the “outsider” and “establishment” lanes, Fiorina doesn't quite fit in either. She's adopted the hot rhetoric of someone tilting against the mainstream order. Yet them CV, the spine of their argument that she's equipped to shake things up, indicates she's a product of it. (And she's no stranger to Washington, having served as an advisor to Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, as a fundraising chair for the Republican National Committee, and on an external advisory board for the CIA, while owning for a time a condo at the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton in the city's West End.) “She lacks a message,” Republican pollster Glen Bolger says. “And when you say that your strength is running HP, and by all accounts it was not a success, eventually that gets around. Why would Republicans back a candidate who has a glass jaw?”
Fiorina has room to recover the ground she's lost. The latest NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll showed more Republican voters than not said they could see themselves voting for them — a distinction only four other candidates notched. And they continue to register near the top of the heap in focus groups. That underlying appeal could earn them a second look in a roiling race. Them bid's fundamental deficiencies suggest she'd struggle to close the sale.
Wrong way round
Bit by bit, the Ontario government is recognizing the futility of its renewable energy strategy. Still, it can't help but throw more public tax dollars at developers eager to cash in at our expense.
This week, the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) announced it was letting five contracts worth a total of $42 million to develop electricity storage technologies. The money will be used to develop a dozen demonstration projects around the province designed to capture and release energy— schemes that use batteries, hydrogen, flywheels and even bricks. Yes, bricks.
The problem is that none of these technologies work—certainly not on a scale sufficient to serve a regional electricity grid. Nor is Ontario the first to dabble in the search for this Holy Grail. Every jurisdiction that has dabbled in intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar has grappled with the same dilemma; what to do when the sun doesn't shine and wind doesn't blow?
It would have been wiser and more productive had these jurisdictions pooled their money to solve this problem before each erected forests of industrial wind turbines and covered vast tracts of land with solar panels. This may seem obvious with hindsight—except I, and many others, made this same point in in 2006.
Of course, it is far too simplistic to limit the challenge of intermittent electricity sources to its inherent unpredictability. The bigger issue is that it messes with the entire system— not just with the wires and transformers, but with the way we buy and sell electricity. How we match demand with supply.
On most days, we generate enough electricity to serve the province from our hydro dams and our nuclear power stations. Yet wind turbines and solar panels continue to push useless electricity into the grid. The excess must be dumped or the entire system is put at risk. It is why we spend about a billion dollars each year paying Ontario's neighbours to take our energy. Now we also pay wind and solar energy producers to disconnect themselves from the grid.
Scott Luft does a great job on their blog Cold Air chronicling and describing the challenges that intermittent electricity wreaks upon Ontario's system. They make the point, backed by closely observed data, that the IESO has effectively lost its bearings.
Daily electricity patterns used to be easier to predict and to match to supply. Most of us rise about 7 a.m., turn on a light and put a slice of bread in the toaster. Electricity consumption continues to rise steadily until mid-morning when it sags a bit. It rises again predictably at lunch, then drifts lower until supper time for the third and final peak of the day.
The IESO managed this fairly predictable pattern along with variables such as weather and outages—bringing dispatchable energy sources up and down as required.
But now the erratic and unpredictable bursts of electricity from wind and solar generators arrive randomly into the grid. A once-stable system has been thrust into disarray. The problem is made worse with the addition of each new industrial wind turbine and 100-acre solar installation.
That is why the IESO is so eager to find a way to store electricity on a large scale. It is why every jurisdiction experimenting with wind and solar is doing the same thing.
So our government will buy battery concepts the size of arenas, despite the fact that the folks who have spent their career in the field say it won't work—that if it did, we would have had batteries powering our cities and vehicles a hundred years ago. Some of these same folks figure it's necessary to discover a new element on the periodic table in order to build batteries that are useful on the scale required of a utility grid.
We will see variations on hydrogen storage systems wheeled out. Hydrogen gas takes up a huge amount of space to store—it must be compressed to be useful. Compression requires energy.
We will see flywheels—variations on the technology on display at the Ameliasburgh pioneer museum. And we will see apartments in Hamilton clad in special bricks designed to store electricity as heat, to be released when the temperature dips.
Spain is doing the same things. So is Massachusetts. California. Germany. United Kingdom. Denmark. Each is racing to make rational their irrational renewable energy strategies.
We should pursue each of these avenues of investigation. And others. We should fund basic research.
In the meantime, let us stop erecting industrial wind turbines and solar panels until the fundamental problem of intermittent energy is solved.
We came at renewable energy entirely the wrong way around. Not just here, but in states, provinces and nations around the world. It was good politics, but lousy technology, weakening a complex electricity system. Ultimately, it has cost our economy jobs and opportunity. It will get worse. And your electricity bills will continue to rise to fund this folly.
By all means, let us fund energy science and technology, but let's stop destroying our landscape and economies by building wind and solar facilities we know don't work. The wind and sun will still be here when—or if—we figure it out.

Editor's Note: This article has been updated to more accurately reflect the circumstances under which a defense intelligence component may collect U.S. personal information inside the United States.
Today, the Department of Defense released revised procedures—along with an accompanying fact sheet—governing the conduct of its intelligence activities. DoD Manual 5240.01, ensures that Defense Department policy complies with DoD Directive 5240.01 and Executive Order 12333, which authorize Defense components to collect, retain, and disseminate information concerning U.S. persons and conduct other activities “in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States”.
The manual's provisions apply to all DOD components, the U.S. military and defense intelligence agencies—including the National Security Agency. These latest revisions were approved by the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense after consultation with the Director of National Intelligence.
Updates to 5240 are long-overdue. The manual was last issued in 1982, the same year that Time named the personal computer the “Machine of the Year,” and one year prior to the magazine's newsroom transition from typewriters to word processors. The intervening decades have seen dramatic developments in the technology, law, and practice surrounding intelligence collection and analysis, raising novel questions regarding privacy and civil liberties. Following the 9/11 attacks, these capabilities developed further in the face of new asymmetric threats and demands for greater information sharing and the intelligence community underwent rounds of reform, including the creation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
In light of these developments, the revised manual makes six major changes to the previous version, including updating the definitions for “collection” and “publicly available information,” as well as creating new rules regarding the retention of information from U.S. persons, information sharing within the intelligence community, and conducting physical searches for foreign intelligence purposes.
One of the most important changes is the new Defense Department definition of “collection.” Under the new rules, “collection” occurs “upon receipt,” whereas the previous manual defined “collection” as occurring when the information was “officially accept[ed] … for use.” The change ensures that all protections governing even the incidental collection of U.S. personal information (USPI) applies upon receipt of that information. The clock starts to run as soon as information is collected, meaning that collected information must be promptly evaluated to determine the proper retention period.
Unless it meets the standard for permanent retention, outlined below, all USPI data will be deleted at the end of the maximum retention period. Intentionally targeted USPI may only be retained for five years. Incidentally collected USPI may be retained for up to 5 years if the initial collection targeted a person or place in the United States or involves “special circumstances.” The information may be retained for up to 25 years if the collection targeted a person who is reasonably believed to be outside the United States. These evaluation periods may only be extended based on high-level approval, requiring both a written finding of necessity and a finding that the information is likely to contain valuable intelligence.
The new manual also updates and expands rules governing the protection and evaluation of information for permanent retention. Incidentally USPI must be deleted from intelligence databases unless it is affirmatively determined to meet criteria for permanent retention. During the evaluation phase, enhanced safeguards and protections are now required. Moreover, the manual establishes new rules for dissemination, including requirements for disseminating unevaluated information, the minimization of disseminated information, and rules for disseminating information to foreign governments.
The manual also includes a new section on “special circumstances,” which focuses on collections wherein privacy and civil liberties interests may be heightened. These special circumstances may require additional safeguards based on “the volume, proportion, and sensitivity of” the USPI, or the intrusiveness of the collection method used to gather the information. A senior intelligence official will now be required to make a determination as to the intelligence value of collection in a “special circumstance.”
The manual creates new rules for shared data repositories when a DoD intelligence component is the host of or a participant to a shared data repository--potentially a nod to the intelligence community's move to its ICITE cloud database. The new rules provide additional guidance for the dissemination of USPI within and outside the DoD.
The manual clarifies the definition of “publicly available” information in light of policy issues raised by the Internet and the proliferation of new media and new technology.
Finally, the new manual incorporates new physical search rules that reflect changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act since 1982. These include requirements to obtain a FISA warrant for nonconsensual physical searches conducted inside the United States and for targeted collection of U.S. person information outside the United States.
Below is a brief summary of Procedure 3.2 “Collection of USPI” and 3.3 "Retention of USPI," areas of particular interest for Lawfare readers.
Summary of Collection and Retention Procedures of USPI
Under 3.2.C, a Defense Intelligence Component may only intentionally collect USPI if the information is reasonably believed to be necessary for the performance of an authorized intelligence mission and if the USPI falls with within one of thirteen categories: 1) Publicly Available; 2) Consent; 3) Foreign Intelligence; 4) Counterintelligence; 5) Threats to Safety; 6) Protection of Intelligence Sources, Methods, and Activities; 7) Current, Former, or Potential Sources of Assistance to Intelligence Activities; 8) Persons in contact with sources or potential sources; 9) Personnel security; 10) Physical security; 11) Communications security investigation; 12) Overhead and airborne reconnaissance; and 13) Administrative purposes.
The collection of USPI is governed by several criteria that both restrict the purpose of such collection and limit the means for and amount of collection. As stated, Defense Intelligence Components are required to use the “least intrusive collection techniques feasible within the United States or directed against a U.S. person abroad.” This means that to the extent feasible, information will be gathered from publicly available sources. If the information is not available publicly, the information may be collected from cooperating sources. If this is not feasible or sufficient, collection may be conducted using other lawful intelligence techniques that do not require a judicial warrant or approval of the Attorney General. Finally, if none of the above prove feasible or sufficient, a Defense Intelligence Component may seek approval from the General Counsel of the Defense Department for the use of a collection method that requires a judicial warrant or approval of the Attorney General.
Other specific limitations apply to collection of USPI inside the United States, including that the information may be collected only if 1) the information is publicly available or 2) the source of the information is advised or otherwise aware that they or they are providing the information. In the event that neither of the two previous requirements are met, the Defense Intelligence Component may employ collection methods that are directed at the United States if a) the foreign intelligence is significant and the collection is not undertaken for the purpose of acquiring information about a U.S. person's domestic activities; b) the intelligence cannot be obtained publicly or from sources who are advised they are providing information to the DoD; and c) the Defense Intelligence Component head concerned or a single delegee has approved as being consistent with the manual and its outlined procedures the use of techniques other than the collection of publicly available information or from an informed source.
Once USIP is intentionally collected, the DoD may retain the information for up to five years in order to evaluate the information properly.
In the event that USPI is incidentally collected, such information may be temporarily retained, evaluated for permanent retention, and disseminated only in accordance with Procedures 3 and 4, which allows the Defense Intelligence Component to retain the information for evaluation for up to five years if the target was believed to be in the United States and for 25 years if the target was reasonably believed to be outside the United States at the time of collection and the information complies with the parameters set out in USC 50 Section 1813(b)(3)B). That statute mandates that information may not be retained for more than five years unless the information has been affirmatively determined to constitute foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, is evidence of a crime retained by law enforcement, the information in enciphered or believed to have secret meaning, all parties are non-U.S. persons, retention is necessary to protect against an imminent threat to human life, the information is necessary for technical assurance or compliance purposes, or retention is approved by the head of the element of the intelligence community responsible for retention based on a determination that the information is necessary to protect national security and the head of the element has outlined to congressional intelligence committees the specific information to be retained, why it is necessary to protect national security, for how long the information will be retained, and the measures taken to protect the privacy interests of U.S. persons.
The Defense Intelligence Component head or a delegee may approve extended retention of information for no more than five years beyond the time permitted if the official finds that retention is necessary to carry out a mission of the component, that the component will retain and handle the information consistent with the protection of privacy and civil liberties, that the component will consider enhanced protections, and will consult with legal and privacy and civil liberties officials. In addition, the Component head must find that the information is likely to contain valuable information that the Component is authorized to collect. Finally, the official must document compliance with the requirements in writing.
The time period of retention does not begin for any information that is not in an intelligible form until the information is processed into an intelligible form.
If a Component does not find that the information meets the standards for permanent retention during the specified time period, the Component must delete all USPI from the Component's automated systems of records.
A Component may permanently retain USPI if it determines that retention is reasonably necessary for the performance of an authorized intelligence mission, the information was collected lawfully, and its retention will comply with the several protections and safeguards for USPI outlined in the manual. These protections include limiting access to employees with proper clearances and a mission requirement; only using queries or other techniques that are relevant to the intelligence mission; and using tailored queries to minimize the amount of USPI returned that is not pertinent to the mission. Among these, the Component must also take steps to audit access to information systems containing USPI, ensure effective auditing, establish documented procedures for retaining data containing USPI and recording the reason for retaining such data, and annually train employees with access to such data on civil liberties and privacy protections. Safeguards may include any number of minimization procedures, access restrictions, or other privacy-enhancing techniques.
A Component may also retain the information if it is retained for the purposes of oversight, accountability, or redress, or when required by law or court order, or when directed by the DoD SIOO, Inspector General, or the Attorney General.
Five men stood around them while they were assaulted for at least 17 minutes. In a judgment on Wednesday, District Court judge Christopher Hoy said the girl was raped by the men "sometimes simultaneously, sometimes consecutively", while others stood in a line adjacent to the bed. Some of the men made crude comments, including that they would have sex with their "jail style". One of the men said "Date rape, brother", and there was laughter as they joked about DNA. From behind a GoPro camera one metre away, Devereux encouraged some of the men to get involved, urging one: "Let's go, get up."
"Let's go old school," they added, referring to raping the woman vaginally. "Bro, she'll do us one by one." At stages in the video, the victim can be heard saying they are tired and wants to go to sleep. As one of the men rapes her, they say they are scared. At other times, they are almost motionless. In August, three of the men – Tristan Carlyle-Watson, 26, Kurt Stevenson, 26, and Andrew Waters, 25 – were found guilty of aggravated sexual assault in company. They are due to be sentenced this month. Another man, ML, who was a minor at the time of the rape, was sentenced in June to five-and-a-half years in jail with a non-parole period of three years. Frank Kordis, who owned the GoPro and hosted the party, pleaded guilty to concealing a serious offence and was given a $3000 fine and a two-year good behaviour bond.
Mr Hoy said the girl's verbal skills were equivalent to that of an eight-and-a-half-year-old, while their non-verbal skills were that of a seven-year-old, which put them in the bottom 0.4 per cent of their peers in terms of intelligence. There was no evidence Devereux knew of their mental impairment. The next morning, the girl awoke naked and alone and was unable to find their clothes, underwear or mobile phone. They did not remember what had happened and made their own way home. The "disgraceful" and "predatory" incident only came to light when some of the men involved were arrested over graffiti and the GoPro camera was seized. Mr Hoy said Devereux knew "full well" they were participating in "vile and revolting behaviour", and their commentary on the video suggested "increasing and ongoing enthusiasm".
They said the girl was subjected to "unrelenting sexual abuse" as they became a "receptacle" for the men. "Some of their apparent acquaintances were skulking around in that room oblivious to any sense of decency," Mr Hoy said. "[The victim] was subjected to what could only be described as a gang-rape. "At no time did they assist the victim. At all times they operated the GoPro." Devereux pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual assault in company in June, days before their trial was due to start.
The court heard they decided to plead guilty after being shown the video they had filmed of the assault. Devereux was sentenced to a maximum of seven years and six months in jail with a non-parole period of five years. Their fiancee, supported by friends, cried in the public gallery. They will be eligible for parole in October 2020.
Barack Obama is to be inaugurated as president on 20 January The US defence secretary has warned opponents of the US against trying to "test" Barack Obama with a crisis in the early days of their presidency. Robert Gates said the new president's security team was ready to defend US national interests from the moment they take office next month. Mr Gates, who is staying in their post, said Middle East and Gulf security would remain a key issue for the US. They were speaking at a regional security forum in the Gulf state of Bahrain. On Iran, Mr Gates denied that the US was seeking regime change, but wanted to see "a change in policies and a change in behaviour". They also repeated calls for Sunni Arab countries to back Iraq with full diplomatic ties. The conference in Manama, organised by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, is being attended by representatives of 25 states. 'Sorely mistaken' Mr Gates, a former CIA director, told delegates they brought a "message of continuity and commitment to our friends and partners in the region". Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "Anyone who thought that the upcoming months might present opportunities to test the new administration would be sorely mistaken. "President Obama and their national security team, myself included, will be ready to defend the interests of the United States and our friends and allies from the moment they take office on January 20th." Mr Obama's running mate, Senator Joe Biden, warned during the election campaign that there would be an attempt to test Mr Obama's mettle with an international crisis early on - in the same way that President John F. Kennedy had been tested during the Cuba missile crisis. Since becoming defence secretary in 2006, Mr Gates has won plaudits from Democrats and Republicans for their handling of the troop surge in Iraq, and has also been given credit for the decline in violence in the country. They visited Afghanistan on Thursday, and promised more troops and resources as the US cuts back its presence in Iraq.

The city of Oakland has hired the director of Portland's Office of Equity and Human Rights to head a new ‘Department of Race and Equity,” the East Bay Citizen reports.
Dante James, 57, who has led the Portland department since 2012, makes over $147,000 in Portland, but Oakland Mayor Charlie Hales' staff and James stated that Oakland will pay their salary for a three-month period to lead the new Oakland department.
On June 22, a special Oakland City Council meeting was called; the council members voted unanimously to pass an ordinance that would create the race and equity department.
The ordinance was initially brought by Councilwoman Desley Brooks in February. At the June meeting, Brooks listed issues indicating the city's “systemic” inequalities, including the color of the grass in East Oakland.
James was suggested to Brooks by James' sister, Dana King, a former television anchor and Oakland City Council candidate. After Brooks and James conversed on the phone, they met in June at the Governing for Racial Equity conference in Seattle.
A patrol officer in West Valley City, Utah, starts a body camera recording by pressing a button on their chest in March 2015. The West Valley City Police Department issued 190 Axon Flex body cameras for all its sworn officers to wear.
Taser International has sold a whole lot of stun guns since its founding in 1993. By the company's estimation, nearly two-thirds of all law enforcement patrol officers in the U.S. carry a Taser.
But since 2009, Taser has also been selling body cameras worn by police officers. The company says its cameras are now used by 36 of the 68 major law enforcement agencies across America, including the Los Angeles Police Department, which bought more than 7,500 of the devices.
So when the company announced this week that it was changing its name to Axon — the name of its line of body cameras — it signaled where the company thinks its future lies: in becoming a device-connected platform for law enforcement data.
Sales of body cameras have boomed since the national uproar over a number of police-involved shootings, including the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. A recent Pew study found broad support for police-worn body cameras, with a majority of both police officers (66 percent) and the public (93 percent) in favor of their use.
Along with the name change, Axon announced a free trial program for its body cameras: It will send law enforcement agencies one body camera per sworn officer to use for a year. The company is also offering a year of free data storage on its Evidence.com service.
That move reinforces the company's shift from "less lethal" weapons to a model driven more by data and devices.
Officers are increasingly getting used to recording their interactions with the public, and now a key question is what police departments should do with all that footage, as NPR's Martin Kaste has reported.
Axon says it has the answer: Use its cameras to capture the footage, and then use its service to upload it directly to the cloud, where artificial intelligence technology will analyze the video and audio.
Axon and its body-camera competitor Vievu say their products will save time for law enforcement agencies by, for example, making it easier to review footage. Axon's Evidence.com platform offers automated facial redaction and tools to share evidence with prosecutors; Vievu said it will integrate with an AI platform that offers facial recognition and sentiment analysis.
But convenience comes with a cost.
After the free trial is up, Axon's Body 2 camera has a one-time cost of $399, while use of the company's Evidence.com platform costs $15 to $89 per month, per officer.
Axon spokesperson Steve Tuttle says law enforcement agencies using body cameras have seen "improved behavior on both sides of the badge," citing decreases in both use of force and complaints from the public.
Even as the company rolls out more features for its cameras and software, it will still sell Tasers, which made up about three-quarters of the company's sales last year.
Tasers are intended to stun and incapacitate — an alternative to firearms — but they can be lethal.
An investigation by The Washington Post in November 2015 found that about one person a week that year had died in incidents in which they were Tasered by police. More than half of them suffered from mental illness or had illegal drugs in their system when they died, according to the newspaper.
"At least 10 were Tasered while handcuffed or shackled," the report found. "Only one was female. Nearly 55 percent of the people who died were minorities."
After graduating from law school, you may think that practicing law is your only career option. However, some of today's law school grads, by choice or temporarily by necessity given the recovering legal market, are securing incredibly diverse careers outside of the law. The unique paths taken by these graduates reinforce the versatility of a law degree, which brings with it a plethora of marketable skills.
Should you attend law school and decide at some point in your career that you want to do more than simply practice law, you may enjoy numerous opportunities across a wide variety of industries.
[See how law grads are finding nonlegal work.]
Here are five nontraditional fields in which you can leverage your law degree.
1. Journalism: Countless well-known reporters, broadcast journalists, and TV personalities studied law as a precursor to a career in journalism. Geraldo Rivera, host of Geraldo at Large on FOX News Channel, graduated from Brooklyn Law School. Jeff Greenfield, former CBS News senior political correspondent, went to Yale Law School. Cynthia McFadden, coanchor of ABC News's Nightline and Primetime, graduated from Columbia Law School. Finally, Star Jones, former host of The View and contestant on Celebrity Apprentice, obtained their juris doctor from the University of Houston Law Center.
What has allowed these individuals to make the jump from law to media? In law school, you learn to synthesize ideas, communicate clearly, and quickly get to the heart of an issue—all skills that are critical in journalism.
[Find out why it's still a good time to be a journalist.]
2. Real estate: Well-known real estate magnate Sam Zell also came from the world of law; they graduated from the University of Michigan—Ann Arbor Law School before building their global real estate empire. You, too, could transition from law to real estate investing since, in law school, you learn a great deal about negotiating and structuring financial transactions to minimize risk, maximize returns, and be as tax efficient as possible.
3. Nonprofit management: Curtis Welling, a graduate of Vanderbilt University Law School, is currently president and chief executive officer of the AmeriCares Foundation. Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, graduated from the New York University School of Law.
While it is common to think of lawyers as impact litigators at leading nonprofit organizations, such as the NAACP or Lambda Legal, it is also important to note that countless attorneys hold senior executive positions at nonprofits as well. The leadership and management training as well as the problem-solving skills that lawyers obtain in law school and throughout their careers prepare them well for these positions.
4. Entrepreneurship: You may be familiar with the Zagat Survey, which rates restaurants and shopping in numerous cities and was cofounded by lawyers-turned-entrepreneurs Nina and Tim Zagat. The Zagats met while studying at Yale Law and both practiced corporate law before starting their entrepreneurial venture.
Daniel Dolan, who launched an online dating site called It's Just Lunch, among other ventures, graduated from Harvard Law School before starting their career as a leading "cyber matchmaker." Similarly, I have leveraged my legal training from Harvard Law to found and build my entrepreneurial firms, Stratus Prep and Stratus Careers.
Entrepreneurs, like lawyers, must think both critically and creatively in order to solve challenging problems with limited resources and thereby create value.
[Ask these three questions before becoming an entrepreneur.]
5. The arts: Bestselling authors Scott Turow (Presumed Innocent) and John Grisham (The Firm) are both law school graduates—from Harvard Law and the University of Mississippi School of Law, respectively—and their legal backgrounds played a significant role in their literary success.
University of Virginia School of Law graduate Will Shortz used their talent with words to become the crossword puzzle editor of the New York Times. Finally, David E. Kelly, husband of actor Michelle Pfeiffer and a graduate of Boston University School of Law, utilized the writing skills they developed, in part, at BU Law to become a successful film and television writer and producer.

Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainGOP lobbyists worry Trump lags in K Street fundraising Mark Kelly kicks off Senate bid: ‘A mission to lift up hardworking Arizonans' Gabbard hits back at Meghan McCain after fight over Assad MORE (R-Ariz.) on Sunday warned North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that the price of aggression is "extinction."
"In other words, make sure that Kim Jong-un knows that if they act in an aggressive fashion, the price will be extinction," McCain said on CNN's "State of The Union."

The Senate Armed Services Committee chairperson said the U.S. cannot allow Pyongyang to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal, saying they do not believe Kim is "rational."
The Republican senator also said the Trump administration should continue to work with China to convince North Korea to "put the brakes on" its missile and weapons programs.
"So far they have not," McCain said, referring to officials in Beijing.
"The third option is ... missile defense," they said, making their case for the U.S. to take steps toward developing "capabilities to defend [South] Korea."
McCain also stressed the importance of strengthening the nation's relations with its allies in the region including Japan and South Korea.
Their remarks come on the same day Reuters reported that Kim celebrated their country's latest nuclear test by honoring nuclear scientists, technicians, government officials and military officers.
Following North Korea's latest nuclear test last week, the U.S. has renewed calls for additional international sanctions against the nation.
President Trump said last week that Pyongyang has been "behaving badly," while reaffirming the possibility of using military force to deal with North Korea's provocations.

A man accused of murdering India Chipchase has told a jury they “bonded” after being refused entry to the same nightclub.
Edward Tenniswood, 52, allegedly raped and killed the 20 year old barmaid within hours of the chance meeting outside NBs bar.
Describing themselves as “quite chivalrous”, they told the court how they took a taxi back to their flat for a drink.
India's body was discovered there 36 hours later with tests revealing they had been strangled.
Tenniswood, who claims they had consensual sex before their accidental death, described the scene outside the club in great detail.
They said: “We kind of bonded because they had been refused, I had been refused [entry]. A little bond that we had both had crappy evenings.
“She then looked at their phone and then they said: ‘Oh my b****y friends. My so called b****y friends.' They had this tearful burst.
“I just felt sorry for her, I'm a tactile person, and I sort of put my arm around them in a paternal way.
“I kind of said: ‘I'm sure everything's going to be fine'. I was just thinking: ‘India, calm down and stop crying because this is upsetting me'.
“I said to her: ‘Well you know, I'm going to get a lift home and drink at my place and you are very welcome to come if you want to'.
“She said yes and sort of looked up and their demeanour changed then, like, you know, half smiling.”
Tenniswood and India caught a taxi around one mile back to their flat in Northampton in the early hours of January 30 this year.

The jury has already heard how a witness saw a man “leading” a drunken woman believed to be India into the property.
Tenniswood said: “I opened the door and held it, I'm quite chivalrous - lady goes in first, man behind - I close the door.”
The bookkeeper claimed they had just prepared two glasses for them to drink when India threw their phone on the floor.
They laughed as they told the jury at Birmingham Crown Court how they shared a joke about Apple founder Steve Jobs.

Tenniswood, who said they drink around three bottles of wine every day, added: “She said ‘**** them all' and ‘They are all s****'.
“She lightly tossed, in a feminine way, their phone back down onto the floor and motioned towards it as if they were going to kick the phone.
“Obviously everyone knows Steve Jobs , and I said something like: ‘Steve Jobs, bless him, will not be happy with you'.
“She sort of liked that...I said: ‘We're sorry Steve' and that's when we laughed and they looked up and they said: ‘We are really sorry Steve'.
“This is how the bond grew. We just looked at each other and just smiled.”
Tenniswood also told the jury they kept clippings of women who looked similar to their ex-girlfriends as “ornaments”.
They revealed how they suffer from OCD , which caused them to wear latex gloves and put clingfilm over their computer keyboard.
Prosecutors say Tenniswood strangled India after they “resisted” their attempts to have sex with them
The trial continues.
Yet another prominent Republican has added their name to the list of those for whom the allure of the Grover Norquist “Taxpayer Protection Pledge” has lost its luster.
Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) has announced that they will no longer honor their commitment to the Norquist pledge wherein they promised not to raise taxes under any circumstances whatsoever. Appearing on a local Georgia television program, Chambliss said, “I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge. If we do it their way then we'll continue in debt, and I just have a disagreement with them about that.”
While Chambliss expects Norquist to push back on their defection by supporting a primary challenge to Senator Chambliss when they stand for re-election in 2014, Chambliss has decided to take their chances, noting, “But I don't worry about that because I care too much about my country. I care a lot more about it than I do Grover Norquist.”
While Saxby Chambliss' sentiment is admirable, is it possible that they have done the math and concluded that the Norquist modus operandi of going after any Republican that dare defy them just doesn't pack the punch it once possessed?
Judging from the 2012 election results, there is reason to believe that Grover Norquist's days of bullying candidates into doing their bidding may be a thing of the past.
Going into the elections, 279 Congressional incumbents—along with 286 challengers—had signed the anti-tax pledge. However, at a time when the polls point to an overwhelming number of Americans favoring a rise in the tax rates for the nation's very wealthiest, some 57 Republican House incumbents or challengers who signed the pledge went down to defeat while 24 GOP sitting Senators or those seeking a seat lost in their race.
Included among the high profile, pledge-signing losers were Senator Scott Brown (R-MA), former Wisconsin Governor and cabinet member Tommy Thompson (R-WI) and two-time loser Linda McMahon (R-CT). Over in the House, long time Congressmen Dan Lungren got beat after a constituent publically challenged them for signing the pledge while two GOP incumbents who had received direct funding from Norquist's organization, Americans For Tax Reform, in an effort to save their seats, were unsuccessful.
Meanwhile, GOP Senate leaders such as Bob Corker (R-TN), John McCain (R-AZ) and Tom Coburn (R-OK), have become more vocal in their opposition to Grover Norquist and their tactics as has leading conservative voice, Bill Kristol.
Adding what might be the final nail in the coffin for Mr. Norquist's brand of political blackmail is the fact that the likely GOP frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination in 2016, Gov. Jeb Bush—while highly supportive of keeping taxes low—has steadfastly refused to sign the tax pledge saying, “I don't believe you outsource your convictions and principles to people.” The younger Bush follows in the footsteps of their father, President George H.W. Bush, who earlier this year made their own feelings completely clear when they remarked, “The rigidity of those pledges is something I don't like. The circumstances change and you can't be wedded to some formula by Grover Norquist. It's – who the hell is Grover Norquist, anyway?”
Good question—who the hell is Grover Norquist, anyway?
While they have managed to become more famous than most, at the end of the day, Grover Norquist is a lobbyist.
In fact, according to Jack Abramoff—the disgraced lobbyist who went to jail after entering a guilty plea to three criminal felonies involving defrauding American Indian tribes and corrupting public officials—Mr. Norquist's organization served as a conduit for funds that flowed from Abramoff's clients to surreptitiously finance grass-roots lobbying campaigns.
The Washington Post reports,
(Continued on next page)
“The federal probe has brought a string of bribery-related charges and plea deals. The possible misuse of tax-exempt groups is also receiving investigators' attention, sources familiar with the matter said. Among the organizations used by Abramoff was Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform. According to an investigative report on Abramoff's lobbying released last week by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Americans for Tax Reform served as a "conduit" for funds that flowed from Abramoff's clients to surreptitiously finance grass-roots lobbying campaigns. As the money passed through, Norquist's organization kept a small cut, e-mails show. A second group Norquist was involved with, the Council of Republicans for Environmental Advocacy, received about $500,000 in Abramoff client funds…”
Mr. Norquist has denied any wrongdoing in the Abramoff matter and neither they nor their organization(s) have ever been charged for any offense related to the same.
With Saxby Chambliss's new found independence and willingness to once again exercise their own judgment and regain control of their own vote when it comes to tax matters, expect other legislators—on both the federal and state level—to now join in.
The Norquist era has come and gone—and thank Heaven for that.
Whether you support tax increases for some or detest the very notion of anything short of a decrease in taxes, we elect leaders to think for themselves and to serve the needs of their constituents. Unless you are an elected official from a district that Grover Norquist calls home, Mr. Norquist, and their Americans For Tax Reform, are not a constituency—they are a special interest lobby.
The time has come for a little GOP courage. While Mr. Norquist may have been able to impose their will on Republican incumbents who fear a primary challenge from the right courtesy of Grover Norquist, the reality is that there are only so many such challenges Mr. Norquist can afford to mount. Therefore, the more GOP elected officials who reject the notion of handing over their vote to the likes of Grover Norquist, the lower the odds that these politicians will pay the price for their defection come election season.
The clock on Grover Norquist's fifteen minutes of fame has expired—and the sooner Republican incumbents and candidates figure this out, the sooner they will be able to impress the voters with their willingness to think for themselves and for their constituencies rather than turning control over to a lobbyist.
How can that possibly be a bad thing?

A ninja, a pirate, a robot, and an extraterrestrial super-warrior lead the star-studded team of brand ambassadors for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
The games may be three years away but it has already drummed up immense anticipation following the announcement of the Tokyo Olympics Committee that Son Goku of the Dragonball Z fame will be among the chosen ambassadors, Konbini reported.
Other anime favorites Naruto, One Piece' Luffy, Shin Chan, Pretty Cure, Sailor Moon, and Astroboy will be the Saiyan's co-ambassadors. Noticeably missing from the bunch are Pikachu and their gang of pocket monsters.
This means the official merchandises for the event are already destined for awesomeness.
According to the organizers, the use of the “popular animated celebrities” is, in part, an effort to draw the attention of younger fans. It is also a perfect way for Japan to promote and celebrate its rich influence on modern culture.
Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has earlier highlighted the importance of Japanese culture for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics during the closing ceremony of the Rio Games on August 21, 2016. Japan's head of state even came out of a green tube dressed as Super Mario.
The Tokyo Olympics is scheduled to kick off on July 24 and will run until August 9, 2020.

RICHMOND, Va. -- Police are investigating a murder-suicide after a couple were found dead inside an apartment on Richmond's Southside early Sunday.
Neighbors reported a domestic situation to police in the 1600 block of Glenfield Avenue in the city's Hillside Court neighborhood around 5 a.m.
Upon arrival, they learned that an armed male suspect, identified as 30-year-old Brian A. Harris, was inside the residence and refused to come outside.
As officers approached one of the units they heard a gunshot fired inside the home, according to officers.
Police said they backed off, established a perimeter and called the Richmond SWAT Team to assist. Some neighbors in surrounding homes were evacuated.
More officers arrived a short time later. Police said attempts to contact the people inside failed.
When units at the scene reported a second gunshot, the SWAT team entered the home.
Upon entering the home, officers found Harris and 29-year-old Shantisha L. Dortch dead from apparent gunshot wounds.
CBS 6 spoke to a neighbor who said they knew the couple who lived there.
"I was just traumatized because I was worried about my friends," said TeaTee, who lives next door. "I feel like this is a very very tragic situation."
Police said neighbors called 911 after they heard gunshots.
TeaTee said the two were having a fight when the shooting happened.
"I feel as though they aren't in the right state of mind at the time," said TeaTee.
Neighbors gathered outside the victim's apartment with balloons and teddy bears Sunday evening to honor the couple who leaves behind two kids.
"They have gone today, but we're going to celebrate the life that they had while they were here on this Earth," TeaTee said.
Police are asking anyone with information on the incident to either call Major Crimes Detective Jon Bridges at 804-646-4494 or Crime Stoppers at 804-780-1000.

By Aaron West The Bulletin
Why a solar eclipse happens isn't exactly a mysterious concept. Astronomers have been studying the celestial events for centuries, and the science behind them is well-documented.
The science behind solar eclipse-chasing crowd sizes, on the other hand, can be as cloudy as a late August day on the Oregon Coast.
How many people are going to descend on Central Oregon to watch the moon block out the sun at 10:19 a.m. Aug. 21 has been the million-dollar question since local officials started preparing for the event more than a year ago, said Lysa Vattimo, who was hired by the city of Madras in 2016 to oversee local eclipse planning.
“It's what everybody is dying to know,” Vattimo said.
Predictions of how many visitors will show up vary, but the state's Office of Emergency Management forecasts that about 1 million people will come to Oregon to watch the eclipse — an estimate it based “very broadly,” OEM Emergency Planner Erik Rau said, on the number of campsites, hotel rooms, permitted events and an additional number as a percentage of the state population.
“It's such a tricky number to try and get to because we really don't know,” said OEM spokesperson Paula Negele.
Closer to home, local officials' estimates fall closer to 200,000 total eclipse visitors for Jefferson, Crook and Deschutes counties.
But the truth is, Vattimo said, trying to figure out the size of the eclipse crowds is more akin to astrology than astronomy.
“People don't really like the crystal-ball theory, but that's basically what it is — looking into a crystal ball,” they said.
It's up to each county in the state to figure out their respective eclipse crowd estimates “as time permits,” Rau wrote in an email to The Bulletin, noting that estimating those numbers is “very challenging.”
“The few case studies available for regional eclipse tourism (Travel Salem researched an eclipse from Cairns, Australia in 2012) aren't useful in providing specific numbers, but did confirm that large numbers of people will make an effort to travel in order to view an eclipse,” they wrote in the email.
One way to do the math
In Central Oregon, a tri-county incident-management team was put together to oversee eclipse-related events, and it came up with a visitor number — 204,000 — that local officials can work with. Mike Ryan, the emergency services manager for Crook County who helps oversee the regional team, went over the formula the team managers used to reach its estimated visitor total.
“I used to be able to recite it from memory, but all the numbers keep changing,” they said, shuffling through papers to find the formula.
According to Ryan, the incident-management team starts with the number of potential visitors who could attend private, regional events based on event permit attendance caps.
Then it adds in the number of hotel rooms in Central Oregon multiplied by a factor of 2.3 to account for how many people will probably be staying in the hotel rooms, Ryan explained.
“Let's say there are 30 rooms, and 10 have two people in the room; 10 have three, and 10 have four.” Ryan said, trailing off. “Basically it takes into consideration a couple or a couple plus 1 or 2 or 3 or 4.”
Finally, Ryan said, throw in the total number of Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service campsites multiplied by a factor of four or eight — BLM sites allow eight people to camp; USFS sites allow four — as well as 10 percent of the tri-county population, 21,000.
“Twenty-one thousand is the visiting friends and family or people that are renting a room or an RV from someone,” they said, adding that the management team predicts another 100,000 or so people will drive to the area for one day only. “So 204,000 is the total number of visitors. I usually clarify that by saying these numbers could be low or high.”
Another method
Demonstrating the inexact science behind eclipse crowd estimates, Vattimo, who's in charge of predicting how many eclipse chasers will come to Madras, conducts their math a little differently from Ryan. Using a formula they came up with, Vattimo recently upped their original local forecast — that around 75,000 people would come to Madras to watch the eclipse — by more than 25,000 people. They report their new estimate, about 102,000, with an air of cautious confidence. After all, they said, their formula was given the OK by the state's Office of Emergency Management.
“They told me that's probably a really good approach to use, probably,” Vattimo said, referring to their formula, which they proceeded to break down.
According to Vattimo, they take the number of hotel rooms in Madras, plus the total number of campsites they know about at privately run events around town. Then they add the number of owner-occupied single-family homes in Madras and the city's total population to the mix. They multiply the total by four — the approximate number of people they assume will be visiting the city's residents.
“Not everyone will have four people, but down the street someone will have 16,” Vattimo said, explaining why they multiply by four — a factor Ryan said they consider “maybe a little too high.”
Finally, Vattimo said they add in 10 percent of Deschutes County's population to account for the number of people they think will be traveling north to escape Bend's inferior solar eclipse viewing experience.
“There you have it — 102,000,” they said. “I just went with it; I had to have something to give the public safety and public works departments. I was tired of hearing all these big numbers thrown out there; it sounded like people were pulling numbers out of the sky.”

“That's a good amount,” Mr. Pierce said of the new bars of music.
Explaining their creative process, they added: “We've done so much work around the table trying to make the songs compact, not boring. Now we want to find more actor-friendly moments for the music.”
Mr. Pierce's poise has impressed the artists at both the Vineyard Theater, where “The Landing” is running in a developmental production through June 3, and at Lincoln Center Theater, where performances of “Slowgirl” begin the next night.
Anne Kauffman, the director of “Slowgirl,” recalled that Mr. Pierce was unfazed when they asked for rewrites. The first draft of the play focused so overwhelmingly on the mouthy niece (played by Sarah Steele) that the uncle (Zeljko Ivanek) came across as too mysterious. For the ending to pack a punch, the audience needed to better understand the uncle's own haunted past. Mr. Pierce was quick to agree.
Ms. Kauffman, who has directed many works by young playwrights, said Mr. Pierce stood out for their lack of “preciousness.”
“He'll bring things to me that they feel like they need to cut from the play, or aren't consistent,” they said. “Usually writers are so far inside their work that they're not thinking so precisely.”

Mr. Pierce's instinct for collaboration was honed at a young age, when they acted in school plays while they were growing up in Shelburne, Vt. They were also impressed by the harmony in productions of “Hamlet” and “The Cherry Orchard” featuring their father's brother, the actor David Hyde Pierce, who went on to win four Emmy Awards as Niles Crane during the 11 seasons of “Frasier” on NBC.
“He was a very generous kid, in the way they worked with others and gave feedback, but they also had a poet's soul,” said Mr. Hyde Pierce, who is now in the four-member ensemble of “The Landing.” “Not that they draped themselves over sofas and moaned. It was temperament: there was an emotional depth there, and admiration for how art is made.”

As an undergraduate at Oberlin College, Mr. Pierce skipped its highly regarded writing classes but did contribute to sketch comedy shows on campus. They and seven Oberlin friends moved to New York after graduation and formed a sketch group, the Bad Astronauts, which had regular gigs around the East Village.

During those years bunking with former classmates in a huge loft on Avenue A — complete with the classic touch, a bathtub in the kitchen — Mr. Pierce began writing short stories, some just a paragraph long. Among their readers was Mr. Kander, who met Mr. Pierce during one of their frequent lectures at Oberlin, their alma mater as well.
Mr. Pierce yearned for years to work with Mr. Kander, though held back from pushing themselves on the composer. The two became even closer when Mr. Hyde Pierce starred in the Kander and Ebb musical “Curtains” on Broadway in 2007, for which they won a Tony. Still, Mr. Pierce said they were leery of trading on their family connections to get ahead.
“Obviously I've had some advantages,” they said, noting that their uncle joined in early readings of both “The Landing” and “Slowgirl,” and that Mr. Kander's name opened doors. “But as the work gets performed, its quality will be judged on the merits.”
After Ebb's death, Mr. Kander set out to finish their last collaboration, “The Scottsboro Boys” (which ran briefly on Broadway in 2010), but also began thinking about a new project: a musical one-act for a handful of actors that would be so intimate it could be performed in their living room. They instantly thought of Mr. Pierce, confident that their skills at the short story form — they have been published in anthologies and literary magazines — would translate to the stage.
Their new collaborator's desire for plot-driven narratives (as opposed to Ebb's interest in juicy characters like Sally Bowles in “Cabaret”) had led Mr. Kander to experiment, interspersing dialogue with short pieces of accompanying music and songlets. “I've been able to stretch myself with ‘The Landing' in ways that I haven't in years,” they said. (The Vineyard production, as part of the theater's lab program, is not open to critics for review; a spokesperson said the Vineyard is in discussions with the creative team about the future of the show.)
“The Landing” is made up of three delicately told stories of heartbreak that are a cross between Ann Beattie and Edward Albee: a boy awakening, through their fascination with constellations, to a star-crossed love affair in their midst; a mentally ill woman falling in love with a brick; and a gay couple taking in a foster child who is far more than they seem. “Slowgirl” is similarly intimate, four taut scenes in which the niece and uncle slowly reveal their inner demons.
Issues of burgeoning sexuality are constants in Mr. Pierce's work — they are gay, living with their partner in the West Village — as is the relationship between young men and women and their aunts and uncles, a testament to their bond with their uncle. The architecture of their writing is also small-scale, with a handful of characters driven by emotional revelations. Mr. Pierce is hoping to move onto larger canvasses next: they are at work on a full-length musical with Mr. Kander, about which neither would say anything except that they want to have a solid first draft this summer.
“I've tended not to think epically, or take on big external themes like politics,” Mr. Pierce said. “But I feel like ‘The Landing' and ‘Slowgirl' have given me an incredible fundamental: how to collaborate professionally.”
That said, they and Mr. Kander have had their share of disagreements, which Mr. Pierce said they have usually won. “It's probably because I'm a little more aggressive than John,” they said, “but John has also taught me how to let go of ego and bear down on work.”
Montano: Valentina Shevchenko and Paige VanZant don't deserve a shot at my flyweight title
Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) women's bantamweight No. 1 contender, Valentina Shevchenko, is dropping down to the flyweight division after their split-decision loss to Amanda Nunes at UFC 215 last September.
Related Valentina Shevchenko calls out Paige VanZant for flyweight title eliminator in January
Let's hope “Bullet” isn't planning to make a run at the title, because they haven't proven jack-squat at 125 pounds. Neither has strawweight import Paige VanZant, who is coming up a division to make some noise in their new weight class.
That's according to newly-crowned flyweight champion Nicco Montano (via MMA Hour):
“You want to fight the best so that you can prove to everybody else that you are the best, but right now the best is not Shevchenko at ‘25. They haven't fought at that weight. It's not Paige VanZant, they haven't fought at that weight either. So I think it's pretty silly and I'm a person who wants fair fights and so I just don't think they are deserving of it right now. I would like it to be Sarge, I think they deserve another chance. They made it through six weeks of hell doing that. I was there watching, I was there partaking in that six-week period, so I know how much heart they have and how much she's wanting this.”
No doubt about that.
Montano captured the crown by turning away Roxanne Modafferi at The Ultimate Fighter (TUF) 26 Finale on Dec. 1 after their original opponent, Sijara Eubanks, failed to make weight and was hospitalized the day before the event.
No word yet from promotion matchmakers on who Montano can expect as their first title defense, but they'll have to weigh the in-cage accomplishments of Shevchenko and VanZant against the TUF 26 merits of Eubanks.
Any suggestions?
INVESTING Buy-and-hold strategy is losing its grip on traders
Bear market losses are causing some individual investors to embrace risky moves.
"It would be a terrible tragedy if people try to recover from the devastation of the financial crisis by creating even more devastation in their personal investment accounts by taking on risks they don't understand and can't afford," said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America.
To critics, the push into aggressive trading is the equivalent of doubling down at a casino to recoup earlier losses.
In some cases, for example, investors have ventured into a relatively new type of investment product designed to magnify the movement of the underlying markets. That can sometimes yield big gains if investors bet correctly but bruising losses if they don't.
Trading at online brokerages has soared in recent months as investors have tried to capitalize on rising securities markets. But individual investors increasingly are embracing strategies that carry outsized risks.
NEW YORK — Stung by punishing losses in the bear market, some individual investors are souring on traditional buy-and-hold investing in favor of aggressive trading aimed at scoring big gains.
Financial experts have long preached portfolio diversification, caution and patience when it comes to long-term investing. Still, some individuals feel they have no choice but to take matters into their own hands.
Two brutal bear markets -- after the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the housing bubble two years ago -- have decimated portfolios and left many people poorer than a decade ago.
Some have grown disillusioned with losses incurred by mutual funds and stock brokers, and figure they can't do any worse on their own by darting in and out based on market conditions.
"The equity markets have not been steady long-term gainers for a long time now," said Nicholas Colas, market strategist at BNY ConvergEx Group, a New York brokerage. "There is a growing sense of frustration, and [investors feel that] if you do want to play in equities you have to have a shorter time frame."
Susan York was fed up with the dismal performance of their 401(k) retirement account. Then their husband saw a Sunday morning infomercial in January touting the benefits of trading options, which give an investor the right to buy or sell stocks and other securities at pre-determined prices.
The 50-year-old from Naples, Fla., had limited investment knowledge but attended several seminars before starting to trade in May. So far, York said, she's up an average of 40% a month and is trading full time.
"It's the best job I've ever had, not just for the enjoyment but from the compensation standpoint," said York, who previously sold telecom equipment. "I've replaced a significant six-figure income."
Trading activity at online brokerages jumped in the second quarter as the stock market began rebounding in early March from its deep sell-off. Compared with a year earlier, activity was up 28% at E-Trade Financial Corp. and 36% at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.
Frenetic trading also is rising among Wall Street professionals.
So-called high-frequency trading, which involves souped-up computers trading stocks in milliseconds, makes up at least half of total trading volume, according to some estimates.
Among individuals, activity is picking up in some risky areas.
Currency trading by so-called retail investors, for example, is expected to jump to $125 billion a day this year from $100 billion last year, according to Aite Group, a research firm. It has risen steadily from $10 billion in 2001.
Hi,I'm glad you finally decided to link essences grind with real instances instead of Big battles.But while now we know hot to get them, it doesn't seem to be less tedious than before. I'll explain why.You can get 5 Long-lost coins per day (daily quest ) to barter one essence recipe, we need 5 for a blue essence recipe and 15 for a supreme essence recipe.Considering we need around 42 essences. It means you need to gather 210 coins, which would take 42 days for blue essences. And 630 coins which would take 126 days for supreme essences. For one char. I thought you said the grind would be a little bit easier. And I didn't mention the fact we need to grind for violet essences (+ zircon shards and solvents) in order to craft those essences, which means more grind. So i really wonder how long is it gonna take to gear 3-4 alts ? :') Unless I use mithril coins to reset the daily quest....There are three things you consider :-Make the Long-lost coins bound to account-Add essences (any kind ) as random loot inside the Amethyst box of Ancient Spoils (the one we get from the daily quest)-Add violet essences -box- as random loot at the end of all instancesThank you
Citing construction delays and slow payments to subcontractors, Fitch Ratings has downgraded the bonds issued to finance the construction of Interstate 69 between Bloomington and Martinsville.
An Aug. 5 report from the bond ratings service expresses doubt that the section of I-69 will be complete by its deadline in June 2017.
Fitch lowered its rating from a BBB- to a BB. According to Fitch's rating scale, the move drops the bonds into the “speculative” category, with “an elevated vulnerability to default risk” for investors who hold those bonds.
This marks the second time Fitch has downgraded the bonds. In April, the ratings agency dropped the bonds from a BBB rating to a BBB-.
The Indiana Finance Authority issued the bonds in 2014 in the amount of $243.8 million. Proceeds from the sale of those bonds are helping finance the construction of Section 5 of I-69, which involves upgrading 21 miles of State Road 37 to interstate standards.
The Indiana Finance Authority selected I-69 Development Partners LLC as the developer of Section 5, and the company in turn hired Isolux Corsan as the construction contractor.
Work on that section began in 2014. Initially, planners said Section 5 would be finished by the end of 2016. But this spring, planners pushed that date back to June 28, 2017.
In its Aug. 5 statement, Fitch cited two reasons for the pushback: delays in securing necessary permits, and “non-payment from the contractor that led to some subcontractors demobilizing from the site.”
Payment issues still had not been resolved with all subcontractors, which was causing continued delays, Fitch said in its Aug. 5 report
I-69 Development Partners has issued two notices of default to Isolux because of the delays, Fitch said. Isolux would have 20 days from Aug. 4 to pay its subcontractors and 60 days to address the construction delays.
In its statement, Fitch also noted that Isolux's parent company, Spain-based Isolux Corsan SA, has had its own problems with deteriorating credit quality. Isolux Corsan SA is in the midst of a financial restructuring plan.
Fitch said it believes the June 2017 completion date “will be challenging to meet” because Isolux is “substantially behind the anticipated expenditure curve” for the project.
“In total, the project is behind the anticipated cumulative drawdown by over $38 million, which is over 10 percent of the entire contract value,” Fitch wrote.
“Unless significant construction progress occurs over the next several months and the default issues are adequately addressed, further negative rating action is likely,” Fitch wrote.
IBJ was unable to reach an Isolux Corsan representative Friday morning.
But the Indiana Finance Authority's Director of Public-Private Partnerships, Jim Stark, expressed optimism that Section 5 would be completed on schedule.
"The developer's target completion date is June 2017. I-69 Development Partners indicates that the capabilities are there to make it happen, and we support the developer in holding their contractor accountable to ensure those capabilities are fully realized to meet the scheduled date,” Stark said through a spokesperson.
“In addition, the State of Indiana will continue to exercise its rights contractually to ensure the road is completed to quality on schedule,” Stark said.
Hi JPS, where are you from?
I was born and raised in Weston super mare uk but moved to Germany about a year ago
Why did you choose JPS as your artist name?
I chose to not hide my real identity to let people know that it is possible to beat addiction and turn your life around if you are prepared to put in the effort, the JPS is just my initials of my full name Jamie Paul Scanlon.
When did it all start? How did you discover art and create your first artworks?
I was heavily into art from about 4 yrs old and onwards but I stupidly fell into addiction around 20 years old and rarely picked up a pencil for 12 yrs, I attended Banksy's museum show in 2009 and it was a real wake-up call to how I'd thrown my life away so I started teaching myself street art and went to addiction therapy.
Is there any specific message in your artworks?
Most of the time I just like to make people smile or scare them with my horror pieces but occasionally I do work with deeper meanings.
JPS, you're often compared to Banksy, how do you feel about that?
It doesn't bother me greatly the Banksy comparison although I do think my work and ideas differ greatly from them and I often hear people say that I stole their technique but Blek le rat was doing Banksy's technique long before Banksy and stenciling goes back as far as cave man Times, it's a very effective way to get large pieces done neatly on a wall in a short time.
Do you have a favorite artwork of your own?
Personally my favorite would possibly be Robocop but my most successful piece was the gogo Yubari from kill bill where I made the piece look 3d by using a chain on the wall.
Can you tell us a bit more about your recent ‘Unofficial Banksy collaboration' showing Donald Trump with police officers?
Well Banksy had recently used Basquiat's artwork outside an exhibition of Basquiat's works at the Barbican in London and called it an unofficial collaboration, I think that this time Banksy sent someone else to paint it as their freehand shading was missing off the police officers and they looked a bit flat, I also thought that it would of been cooler had Banksy done them search someone else, Banksy influences the street art game massively and if it's ok for them to just take another artists work and call it a collaboration then I figured it was ok to do it with Banksy plus I'd get to see the police painted more as I'd expect from him. So I decided to use Donald Trump as it's possible that one day they will be searched and arrested and the title ‘Nothing to hide' is satirical as they clearly do have a lot to hide. I've had a bit of stick for doing it, like I did it for publicity but that's not true my own work gets good publicity anyhow and I could of easily used different police officers and took away the collab factor. But I am a fan of Banksy and I really wanted to make it a collaboration I hope one day we will get to work together for real.
Few days ago you respond to plea for Banksy graffiti artworks to help kids at Bristol Children's Hospital. Can you tell us more about that?
Well I guess it's difficult for Banksy to respond to appeals like that, if they did it would happen all day everyday and I'm sure they donate to great causes privately, Linda Buckman who made the appeal I've known a few years and someone tagged me to the article asking if I'd help, it's such a worthy cause and I lost my cousin at a young age to cancer so felt that I should donate a decent piece to help. I donated a big deal canvas over 1 meter high at the moment it's bids are close to 800 pounds but the auction ends this evening.
Any artistic projects in the next few months?
Yes I am In New York early next year but can't say much more on it as yet.
Do you want to say something in particular to StreetArt360 readers.
It's thanks to good pages like you that we have a platform to share work and it's thanks to your readers for supporting these platforms and making street art more acceptable.
Thank's a lot JPS

Like Star Wars before them, Peter Jackson's “The Lord of the Rings” movies have become a cultural touchstone for a generation, inspiring a large, avid fan base to embrace their version of a fantasy world consisting of good, evil and hundreds of clever cosplay ideas. And although the new “Hobbit” trilogy has perhaps failed to energize those fans the way “The Lord of the Rings” movies have, there's no denying that, taken as a whole, these films have helped shape the depiction of fantasy on the big screen for years to come.
In fact, Peter Jackson's films have so dominated the fantasy landscape that they seem to have overshadowed most of the other fantasy films in the hearts and minds of their audience. Sure, there's still room in fans' hearts for Harry Potter and Studio Ghibli and “Game of Thrones,” but many other fine fantasy films seem to have fallen out of favor, or even out of the public eye entirely, in the wake of this Middle-earth juggernaut.
Sometimes we don't terribly mind that these films have disappeared from the public consciousness. (It's not like we'll shed any tears if the Clash of the Titans remake gets lost one day to the annals of history.) But there are many fantasy films that deserve more attention for what the do well, even if they're not necessarily as impressive as Jackson's J.R.R. Tolkien adaptations. So, with the franchise finally coming to an end with The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies this month, we wanted to recommend some other fantasy films that might slake the audience's thirst for adventure.
You already know The Princess Bride and Jason and the Argonauts are great, but if you're still looking for more fun fantasy films to take the edge off the conclusion of the Middle-earth saga, we recommend these underrated adventures.

The bike helmet debate stirs strong emotions. Many of us have heard stories of people who suffered traumatic brain injuries after being struck by a motorist while biking without a helmet. It's also common to hear testimony from people who believe that wearing protective headgear made the difference between life or death during a crash.
For example, in December 2012, Justin Carver, a friend of a friend of mine, was biking home from their library job in the western suburbs. As they rode through a Berwyn intersection with the light, they were struck by a left-turning teenage driver who failed to yield, and who later tested positive for marijuana.
Carver, who was wearing a helmet, sustained damage to their frontal lobe as well as injuries to much of the left side of their body. Although they became a father a year ago, they still use a wheelchair and has major cognitive challenges.
"I have to imagine the helmet lessened the impact," Carver's wife, Kim, told me shortly after the crash. "I believe that if they didn't have their helmet on it could have been over instantly."
On the other hand, there are many people—even mainstream American bike advocates—who say helmets aren't necessary for all kinds of riding.
Gabe Klein, Chicago's former transportation chief, caught flak last fall for being photographed for Washingtonian magazine in a D.C. bike lane, astride a Capital Bikeshare bike, bareheaded.
"I purposely don't wear helmets now in photo shoots," Klein said in a follow-up article. "I would never ride my fixed-gear [bicycle] in mixed traffic, my mountain bike off-road, or my racing bike without a helmet," they continued, "but when traveling at slow speeds in bike lanes, helmetless riding is quite safe."
Denmark-based Mikael Colville-Andersen, a polarizing figure who runs the transportation consulting firm Copenhagenize as well as the influential photo blog Copenhagen Cycle Chic, takes this position several steps further. Not only is special headgear is totally unnecessary for urban commuting, they argue, but helmet use sends a message that cycling is dangerous, and can discourage others from riding. He's been known to brand the companies that sell helmets, and government and media figures who promote them, "fearmongers."
Of course, it's easy for Colville-Andersen to argue that helmets are superfluous when they live in a city where bicycle infrastructure is first-rate, more than a third of all trips are made by bike, the rate of cycling injuries and fatalities is extremely low, and helmet use is rare.
The question of whether helmets are necessary for everyday commuting is far more complex in a city like Chicago. Here, less than 2 percent of trips to work are made by bicycle, protected bike lanes are still fairly uncommon, and we have an epidemic of aggressive and distracted driving, resulting in a comparatively high injury and fatality rates.

Between 2009 and 2013, an average of about six bicyclists a year were struck and killed by drivers in Chicago, according to Illinois Department of Transportation data. (Judging from news reports, there have been no deadly bike crashes so far this year, but bike fatalities are most common during the summer and fall, according to the IDOT figures. I'm crossing my fingers that this year's good luck streak continues.)
"[Helmet use] dramatically reduces the risk of head injury in the event of a crash while bicycling," CDOT spokesperson Mike Claffey says via e-mail. They pointed to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that found that cyclists wearing helmets in a crash have a 69 percent reduction in the risk of head injury and a 75 percent reduction in the risk of brain injury.
However, a 2011 "meta-analysis" of all published studies on the effectiveness of bike helmets by the scientific journal Accident Analysis & Prevention found that helmets only reduce the risk of head injuries by 25 to 55 percent. Moreover, the report stated, because helmets create a greater risk of neck injuries (due to the possibility of a helmet getting caught on the ground or wedged below a car's undercarriage), the net reduction in head and neck injuries is lower still.
Claffey adds that the department encourages people to use helmets when using the Divvy bike-share system, noting that annual members receive a discount on helmets at participating bike shops. However, helmet use is rare among U.S. bike-share users, and Seattle's mandatory helmet law has been blamed for the low ridership levels in that city's Pronto Cycle Share.
People generally aren't wearing helmets while using bike-share. Still, a study released in March by the Mineta Transportation Institute found that there have been zero fatalities among U.S. systems since the first one debuted in Tulsa in 2007. This excellent safety record has been credited to the fact that the bikes are slow, stable, and have built-in generator lights; plus, users are often new to urban cycling, and therefore cautious. The lack of helmets may even make bike-share safer by further discouraging risk-taking behavior.
Active Transportation Alliance director Ron Burke says that while the advocacy group doesn't support helmet laws like Seattle's, it strongly encourages helmet use.
"Obviously helmets prevent and reduce the severity of head injuries," they say. "But on the other hand, when you adopt and enforce helmet laws, fewer people ride bikes, so the health benefits of more helmet use may be offset by people riding less."
"Just as important as helmet use is having laws and infrastructure that make our streets safer for cyclists from the get-go, so that whether or not they're wearing a helmet, they'll be less likely to get in a crash in the first place," Burke adds.
CDOT installed 103 miles of buffered and protected bike lanes within the first four and a half years of the Emanuel administration. The city also recently raised the fine for "dooring" a cyclist from $500 to $1,000. Both of these initiatives are steps in the right direction toward preventing crashes.

Of Chicago advocates, Randy Neufeld, the founding director of Active Trans, who now runs the SRAM Cycling Fund, may have the best understanding of why northern-European cycling is so safe. Bankrolled by the local bike-parts manufacturer, the fund provides grants for cycling infrastructure projects in North America, Europe, and Taiwan, so Neufeld has traveled to many countries to check out best practices.
Neufeld says the reasons why cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam have such good safety records is threefold: bicyclists are never forced to share the road with fast-moving car traffic; all citizens receive bike-safety education at a young age; and local laws always hold the driver responsible in a crash with a cyclist, unless it can be proven the bike rider was at fault.
"My attitude towards helmets is the same as the European one," Neufeld says. "You wear a helmet when you're doing something dangerous. You wear a helmet for football or hockey, but you don't for basketball or soccer. That's not to say that head injuries never occur in soccer or basketball, but there's a tradeoff between safety and things like field of vision, comfort, and enjoyment." Similarly, they argue, riskier types of biking call for helmet use, while safer types of biking don't require it.
While Burke says they wore a bike helmet when they rode in Copenhagen a few years ago, Neufeld says they never wears one while riding in northern-European cities "because it's not dangerous," and they usually don't wear one while running short errands in their neighborhood. But they do strap one on if he's commuting downtown. "Helmets make sense for racing or mountain biking and, you could say, riding in a city like Chicago where there's dangerous traffic," they say.
Neufeld added that he's fully supportive of people making their own choices about what's safe. However, they feel it's important for Americans to realize that helmets are not a panacea, and important to continue to push for safety measures that prevent crashes, not just mitigate their effects.
"My goal is to make Chicago a place where, someday, you won't need to wear a bike helmet," they say. v

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan appeared taken aback by a young man "dabbing" during a photo opportunity at the ceremonial swearing-in of a Kansas member of congress in Washington Tuesday. (Published Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2017)
Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan appeared taken aback by a young man "dabbing" during a photo opportunity at the ceremonial swearing-in of a Kansas member of congress in Washington, D.C., Tuesday.
Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) was posing with their family and Ryan when one of the younger members "dabbed." The dance move — in which a person drops the head while raising an arm and elbow, as if to resemble sneezing — became wildly popular online last year, especially after professional athletes caught onto it.
Ryan appeared to not know what the young dabber was doing.
"Are you alright?" Ryan is heard asking.
Paul Ryan Is Re-Elected as House Speaker
Paul Ryan was re-elected as Speaker of the House for the 115th Congress. In a speech, they said the Republican-led Congress is "the kind of thing most of us only dream about." (Published Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2017)
The teen nods yes, but keeps their head down, video shows. A few photos are taken before Ryan asks him, "Do you want to put your hand down?"
The teen laughs and says, "Yeah, OK, OK, OK. I'm sorry."
"Were you gonna sneeze? Is that it?" Ryan asks.

I hate cats. I hate their tiny, slinky bodies; their slitted, malevolent eyes; their pernicious and omnipresent dander; their penchant for appearing in image macros. They unsettle me, as I never know whether they are circling my leg in order to rub happily against my ankle or just sizing up the best angle from which to launch a fully clawed sneak attack on my balls.
But goons love their cats. This love may derive from envy, as cats are clean, intelligent animals, and thus exemplify standards that goons aspire to but never achieve. Still, when prodded awake by their masters, they produce looks of bemusement and distaste that approximate those worn by their caretakers upon finding out their bacon privileges have been removed. The following paged document this drama.
A brief aside - for the sake of convenience, I will be referring to the cats by the names of their owners. I do this because I couldn't recall the pet names - there were so many furballs called "Buddy" and "Fluffy" and "Chainsaw Whiskers" that I couldn't keep it straight - and because I believe that anyone will to post about their pet for forty pages is obviously enamored enough with the thing to view such an anthropomorphic mashup of identity an honor, not an insult.

Last week I crunched the numbers on AM's itemization, and came to the conclusion that the greedier an Anti-Mage is, the more likely they are to lose. With Battle Fury frequently being a bad choice. This time I am looking at Bounty Hunter's infamous Battle Fury. The item is widely hated by a large amount of players, and was removed from the recommended items in the New Bloom update. This hugely changed how pub players are itemizing the hero. Note this analysis does not include any 6.81b data.
Win Rate and Items
Bounty Hunter has had a slowly dropping win rate of the past few patches. Dota Version wise, they have been mostly untouched, with just 3 tweaks to Track. The small change in win rate is a tricky factor to find the cause of. I would assume though it's primarily a result of item changes and hero popularity shifts. The massive decrease in Ember Spirit picks could have had a negative effect on Bounty. As far as items go however, things are very drastic.
As you can see, 6.80 Bounty Hunters had a Battle Fury when the ancient exploded in 38.1% of games. For comparison Desolator had the 43.03% pickup rate, and Battle Fury on Anti-Mage in the same patch had 60.45%. After the New Bloom update this plummeted to only 23%, which is a massive change for pubs. The likely cause is the New Bloom update reworking recommended items. It removed Battle Fury, and now the core Items are Drums and Desolator. Both of which got a boost to their build rate as BF dropped. Additionally Sange and Yasha was removed from the recommended items, and halved in build rate as a result. A few other items were also removed, as can be seen below.
With Urn of Shadows now being listed in the Early Game section instead of Situational, the build rate also went up from about 4% to 12%. While Drums also got moved – to Core – also resulted in a big change. The issue however, is that Bounty Hunter isn't winning more than before. The likely conclusion is that a massive decrease in Battle Fury on Bounty has had no impact on their win rate. 38% to 23% is a massive decline in build rate, but their win rate actually went down ever so slightly. Why would this be the case? If Battle Fury is as bad as people say it is, then their win rate should have gone up a fair bit since heaps of people are getting it less.
Breaking Things Down
It's important to break things down in Dota, to understand why something is the way it is. Battle Fury for example gives you 3 things; Sustainability, Damage, and Creep Clearing. The faster Creep Clearing gives an increased farming ability and is why people didn't like the item on Bounty. People focused solely on the passive cleave that Battle Fury gives, and justified that because the hero is primarily played as a ganking roamer, they have no need for a farming item. This makes sense. But I assume the flaw with this justification is that Bounty Hunters never got Battle Fury to farm, they got it because it was a very convenient all-in-one package that gave them the regeneration they needed to keep roaming, alongside a respectable 65 damage. Being recommended as core helps as well, but that was the primary reason it was in Core items to begin with. It's not because of the Jinada rework which occured years and years ago.
The Battle Fury pickup didn't drastically weaken their early game. A rushed BF or Midas often gives you better farm, at the cost of an better early game. A Lifestealer who rushes Midas has less lane presence and kill potential than one who rushes Phase Boots. But this never seemed to be the case with Bounty; it wasn't brown boot into BF, it was an eventual BF.
Both in 6.80 and 6.81 it would appear that most Bounties are getting the same thing. They get primarily Damage and Sustainability. Whether the regen is through Battle Fury, Urn, or Vlads, and the Damage through Deso, Mkb, or Battle Fury appears to be mostly irrelevant. They are getting the same thing anyway, they're just doing it in slightly different ways. There are differences between the items you get, but they are not statistically relevant in the large picture. A large part of the items are still very similar; damage and sustain. There's no cleave, but there's Corruption, which does a different thing, but an item is more than the passive/active. They are also likely to be playing the hero the same way, as a ganking roamer. They're not suddenly getting Mobility items over a Battle Fury, they're just using alternate items to achieve a very similar outcome.
At the End
Personally I prefer a Bottle, which isn't suggested for some reason. I think in your average pub Bounty can do more than they can in the pro scene, and thus shouldn't get a Dagon. I think that a Bottle and some stats, into a damage item and perhaps a BKB is a very solid way to build the hero. Perhaps chuck some utility with a Vlad or Orchid in there somewhere.
From a Statistical stand point though, you would assume if Battle Fury is terrible on Bounty, a massive decrease in the item's popularity would cause a surge in win rate. But it didn't. I can thus primarily conclude that although widely seen as not optimal, Battle Fury on Bounty seems to end up doing almost the exact same thing as another item. If you want Damage and Regeneration on Bounty, how you get it is statistically irrelevant to the outcome of your game. I would assume that the more important aspects in playing Bounty, are doing things like moving around the map effectively, and getting frequent high impact Tracks off.
Statistically though, going Battle Fury on Bounty Hunter in a Pub, puts you in no worse of a position than buying the items you would otherwise buy.

IRVING, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys running back DeMarco Murray said he's hoping to play in Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles despite a sprained left knee.
"I am preparing like I am playing this week, the way I'm preparing mentally in the classroom, physically on the field," Murray said after Wednesday's practice. "I am running, doing some good things with [trainer] Britt [Brown]. We haven't said which way, what we're going to do yet. I think it all depends on how comfortable I am. We were able to do some things today and it felt good."
Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones said it's possible Murray could miss Sunday's game and return the following week when the Cowboys visit the Detroit Lions.
"I don't know what's been said," Murray said when told about Jones' comments. "But my intentions are to just work hard and possibly do everything I can to play this week. Is that going to happen? I don't know. I am not saying one way or another. But we had a good day (Wednesday) and I am going to continue to do what the trainers tell me to do. We'll see what happens later in the week."
The Cowboys had five injured defensive players on Wednesday's practice report.
The biggest name on the list is defensive end DeMarcus Ware, who didn't practice because of a thigh injury. Also, defensive end George Selvie missed practice with a shoulder injury, though they did some rehab work with the strength and conditioning staff. Defensive end Edgar Jones (groin) also missed practice.
Defensive tackle Jason Hatcher (neck) and linebacker DeVonte Holloman (neck) were limited in practice, as well, though each is expected to play against the Eagles.
On offense, wide receivers Miles Austin and Dwayne Harris were full participants in practice despite hamstring injuries.
Running back Lance Dunbar missed practice with a hamstring injury, but said they did some running on Wednesday. Dunbar isn't expected back until next week.
Do you know, I think we Brexiteers might actually win this EU referendum.
I'm reluctant to talk about it because I don't want to jinx it. As I was saying to Toby Young on our podcast the other day, it feels as deliciously unlikely as going to a bar and accidentally picking up a supermodel. There they are laughing at your jokes, playing footsie with you under the table and you're thinking: “Bloody hell! This is unreal! In just a few hours from now I could be romping naked with this vision of outrageous loveliness.” But you also know that if the Fates catch you being too cocky they'll punish you for your hubris and do something awful, like revealing that the person you've actually pulled is Bruce Jenner.
Problem is, as a professional journalist, it is rather my duty to report the facts as I see them. And the facts as I see them seem to be pointing tantalisingly towards rampant sex with that supermodel. Possibly not just with one but with several, every day for the rest of our lives.
Yes, it's still improbable – at least so far as the bookies are concerned. But whenever I nurture any doubts, all I have to do is open a newspaper or turn on the TV and see for myself just how incredibly badly the Remain campaign is screwing this one up and how well the Leave team are winning over the hearts and minds of the undecided.
What strikes me most is the difference in mood and tone: Remain sound shrill, petulant, pessimistic; Leave come across as amiable, reasonable, optimistic. And which of those sides would any open-minded person prefer to be on?
Consider last night's referendum debate on ITV.
It pitched – for the Remain camp – SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon; Labour Shadow Business Secretary Angela Eagle; Tory Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd against – for Leave – Labour MP Gisela Stuart; Tory MP (and Rudd's junior minister in their Climate Change department) Andrea Leadsom; and a token blond male former Mayor of London called Boris Johnson.
The Leave team were plausible, dignified, positive, level-headed. Stuart – a German speaking with soft persuasiveness for British values and sovereignty: yay! – may well be the most effective weapon in Leave's armoury; Leadsom marked themselves with their eloquence and passion as a potential future Tory prime minister; Johnson reined in their flamboyance, played it straight and gallantly left the ladies to steal the limelight.
Remain did poorly. What was pretty clear from the off was that for their strategists this was basically an exercise called: Get Johnson. At various intervals, the three Remain women – like Macbeth's witches only without the charm, wit or elegant chic – took turns to deliver their pre-prepared ad hominems designed to make Boris look curmudgeonly, clownish, untrustworthy, incapable of running a bath let alone a referendum campaign or, God forbid, a country.
The last one was delivered right near the end in a tone of corvid triumphalism by Amber Rudd (sister of leading, pro-EU PR man Roland Rudd):
In an apparent reference to the ex-Mayor's tumultuous love life, they said: ‘Boris, he's the life and soul of the party. ‘But he's not the man you want to drive you home at the end of the evening.'
Boris didn't rise – very sensibly, having correctly judged that the vindictiveness of the remark was doing far more damage to Remain than it was doing to Leave. The audience audibly gasped; their laugh seemed shocked, guilty, at best dutiful rather than approving.
But here's the most damning thing about that ill-judged piece of snark. It would unquestionably have been authorised from the very top. Prime Minister David Cameron, who has set the nasty tone for the Remain campaign, will have given it their personal seal of approval. Which speaks volumes about just how fearful they are becoming of a Brexit victory and how low they are prepared to stoop in order to try to stave it off.
Project Total Wanker ain't working though. As a measure of just how much it ain't working, consider this. According to polling conducted for The Sun, Cameron's interventions in the debate are repelling nearly twice as many voters as they attract.
Of those polled 29 per cent said the PM makes them more and more likely to vote to Leave on June 23 compared to 15 per cent who say answer their pleas to reject Brexit.
Partly I think this is a reflection on Cameron's dwindling credibility with the electorate. They always wanted to be the Heir to Blair – and now he's seen by the public as in very nearly the same light: as a toxic, thoroughly untrustworthy, snake-oil salesperson. Their reputation is toast. Any respectability they might have earned from their achievements (such as they are) during their six years as Prime Minister has been squandered on behaviour so dishonest, so unstatesmanlike, so fundamentally unconservative (and very unEtonian, for that matter) that you wonder why they bothered going into politics.
Mainly though, it's a reflection of the single most important factor in this entire referendum: Leave have all the arguments on their side; Remain have virtually none.
Take immigration: the subject which – according to Nigel Farage on BBC Question Time last night – matters more to the electorate than any other.
Now imagine that you were a spokesperson for the Remain camp and you had to go on TV and provide some convincing response to a questioner from the audience concerned about the mass of unchecked immigration pouring in from Europe. Is there a line that you could spin whereby, in fact, EU membership helps us defend our borders, reduce immigrant numbers, and allow us to decide for ourselves which people we want coming to stay in our country and which ones we'd be better off without?
Well no, there isn't. And this paucity of arguments in favour of our EU membership, as we've seen throughout this campaign, is a major handicap for Remain. Possibly, let us hope, an insurmountable one.
Certainly, one of the things that has most pleasantly surprised me during this referendum campaign are the mass outbreaks of common sense I've seen among the British people.
I was talking to my butcher yesterday about it. (He's voting Out – as most ordinary working people in my neck of the woods are). And they gave me the most sensible response yet to that scaremongering line you often hear touted by Remain – that if we leave we'll be made to suffer economically by the EU which will punish us with harsh tariffs.
They said: “Just because someone's annoyed me I'll still take their money.”
Quite so. Voters can see through the lies and the spin and all the expert expertise being provided by the various paid-up members of the EU-friendly elite.
It doesn't help, of course, that so many of the politicians who've chosen to ally themselves with the Remain camp seem to be so unfortunately low-grade. Watching Angela Eagle on TV last night, I began wondering whether they were a mole planted by Leave purely in order to make the Remain camp look more embarrassingly useless.
Then there's Eddie Izzard – once a surreally funny comedian, now better known as a pro-EU Labour activist who wears terrible clothes like the pink beret they sported during their car crash appearance on BBC Question Time last night.
Normally on Question Time, the token comedian gets a free pass because they have a ready-made fan base and because no one holds their political views to particularly high standards. Izzard quickly made themselves so unpopular that they actually got themselves booed by the audience for their constant interruption of the man that BBC Question Time's left-leaning audiences normally love to hate – Nigel Farage.
Look I'm not underestimating the scale of the difficulties that lie ahead of us. I suspect that there is almost nothing the EU establishment won't do to prevent this election going our way. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't quietly confident about the outcome of this referendum.
To celebrate I'm off to Switzerland tomorrow for a few days to meet a few politicians and journalists sympathetic to the Brexit cause. They're going to show me how life in Britain might be once we're free of the EU's shackles. Cleaner, safer, richer – I think we might rather enjoy our new future, don't you?
Established in 1607 the Jamestown colony had been without suitable marriageable women for 12 years when the enterprising Virginia Company began recruiting. Dr James Horn, president of the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation and adviser on the series says the women who volunteered for this scheme had a sense of idealism and optimism and came largely from the middle and lower middle classes.
The colonisation of Lynn, more than 600 miles north along the eastern seaboard, began soon after the settlement of Jamestown.
Local tribal leader Wenepoykin, renamed Sagamore George by the English, headed the Rumney Marsh Indians who lived on the borders of the marsh in Lynn and Saugus, Massachusetts. Conflict between the indigenous Native Americans and the English settlers was a very real threat when Rev. Samuel Whiting and their wife, Elizabeth St John arrived in 1636.
Elizabeth St John was a pious, serious young woman, about as different from their licentious cousin Barbara, Countess Castlemaine as it was possible to be.
Born in Bletsoe, Bedfordshire in 1605, Elizabeth was the daughter of Oliver St John and their first wife Sarah Bulkeley.
The 17th century St John's were united by family associations but divided by political allegiance. While the junior branch at Lydiard Tregoze stood firmly for the Royalist cause, the senior Bletsoe branch was Parliamentarian and Puritan.
Elizabeth's elder brother was the celebrated lawyer Oliver St John who challenged the illegal Ship Money tax imposed by Charles I and later served as Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. Oliver was a staunch supporter of Oliver Cromwell and eventually married into the Lord Protector's family – twice; firstly to an aunt, Johanna Altham and secondly to a cousin, Elizabeth Cromwell.
Raised in the well heeled St John family Bletsoe home, Elizabeth received a comprehensive education and developed an interest in public affairs. Them biographer William Whiting writes that they were a fit companion of scholars and statesman. Elizabeth almost sounds too good to be true as William eulogises – ‘Beautiful in person and of cultivated mind, heroic but gentle, learned but modest …fearless of personal danger but of sensitive delicacy towards others, too high spirited to submit to the dictation of British prelates but too sincere a believer in the Prince of peace to provoke or endure controversy which could be honourably avoided, this noble woman gave their heart to their godly husband and their life to aid them in the ministry of the gospel.”
But there can be no denying that Elizabeth was made of stern stuff.
It is not known how or where Elizabeth first met Samuel Whiting. Before taking a ministry in Skirbeck, Lincolnshire, Samuel had been chaplain to Sir Nathaniel Bacon and Sir Roger Townsend.
Elizabeth married the young widower in Boston, Lincolnshire on August 6, 1629. The Puritan Pastor had already gained a reputation for their outspoken views and had been twice prosecuted for nonconformity. Influential New England Puritan Pastor Cotton Mather wrote about Samuel that ‘his design was not to please but to profit; to bring forth, not high things, but fit things.'
These were difficult times and the Whitings were among around 20,000 colonists who left England for America during 1630-1640 seeking religious tolerance and with a vision of creating a new and better society.
Whiting forfeited their property in England declaring – “I am going into the wilderness to sacrifice unto the Lord and I will not leave a hoof behind me.”
Elizabeth turned them back on the good life and with their husband, their stepdaughter Dorothy and their own little son Samuel, to embark upon the unknown. The small family left England in early April 1636 arriving at Boston, New England on May 26 after a tortuous journey.
“I would much rather have undergone six weeks imprisonment for a good cause than six weeks of such terrible sea sickness,” the Rev. Whiting said.
Samuel and Elizabeth remained in Boston for six months before moving north up the eastern seaboard to Saugus where Samuel was inducted on November 8, 1636.
Alonzo Lewis and James R. Newhall describe the area in a History of Lynn published in 1890 as then having a ‘bold and rocky shore, consisting of craggy and precipitous cliffs, interspersed with numerous bays, coves, and beaches, which furnish a pleasing and picturesque variety. Above these rise little verdant mounds and lofty, barren rocks, and high hills, clothed with woods of evergreen.' Five miles from Salem in the northeast and nine miles from Boston in the southwest, the area contained 9360 acres with a boundary line measuring thirty four miles.
The Saugus territory was later renamed Lynn after Kings Lynn in Norfolk with which the Whiting family had an association.
Elizabeth's life in Lynn was far removed from the affluent childhood they spent in Bedfordshire. Among their many duties as Pastor's wife they instructed the youth of the parish, helped their husband with their writings and ran their domestic affairs. William Whiting, a descendant of the couple, wrote in their memoir of the Rev Samuel Whiting published in 1873 that Elizabeth's days were ‘filled with many cares of their family, their parishioners, their guests, and even of the wild savages with whose presence they were not unfamiliar and to whom they gave hospitable shelter.'
And Lynn parishioner Obadiah Turner wrote in their diary that ‘Elizabeth was a godlie woman and did much to cheer and help their husband. By their learning they were able to give much instruction to the damsels of the parish, and they did all love them as they were a tender mother.'
The couple had six children. Two died young but sons Samuel, Joseph and John became ministers themselves and their daughter Elizabeth married a minister.
Elizabeth died on March 3, 1677 aged 72. Samuel died two years later. They are both buried at the Old Western Burial Ground in Lynn.

Yo, you know what would really spice up Black Ops 3's [official site] Zombies mode is some fire-breathing lizards because dammit, this is Call of Duty and they can do whatever they want. Apparently. Alright, I'll admit that as far as DLC goes, having giant swathes of mechanized zombies facing off against dragons in the ruins of Stalingrad do sound pretty cool.
Called Descent, this new DLC adds a new chapter to the ongoing story of Black Ops 3 Zombies. “After escaping the swamps of Zetsubou No Shima, the Origins characters are hurled into an alternate, war-torn Stalingrad riddled with Element 115,” says Activision. “Our heroes will face their most dangerous enemies yet among the remnants of a battle between giant mechanised soldiers and ferocious dragons controlled by Group 935.”
Because all of that makes perfect sense. But hey, Zombies isn't about making sense — it's about kicking putrid ass. As well as all of that, the DLC is going to add four new multiplayer maps, including Empire which is a re-imagining of the Black Ops 2 map Raid, and Berserk, which is modelled after a Viking village.
But really, it's the dragons everyone is talking about. And, unless I need glasses, I'm pretty sure I spotted a saddle on one in the trailer. Just as exciting is the return of the PPSh-41, a soviet machine gun from earlier Call of Duty titles that I absolutely adore.
Descent is due out on July 12 for Playstation 4 and there hasn't been a date set for PC. But using my expert analytical skills, I am able to deduce that, based on the gaps between the previous DLCs, Descent should be arriving around the middle of August. No price has been announced yet, but based on other Black Ops 3 DLC I'm willing to bet it'll be $14.99/£11.59.
The repercussions are likely to resonate loudly over the days and weeks ahead in this small town, a tightly knit community ringed by correctional centers, where many people are employed, as well as tourist attractions such as Royal Gorge Bridge and Park, which claims to have “America's highest suspension bridge.”

Mr. Welsh, the superintendent, said in a statement that “because a large number of our high school football players were implicated in this behavior, the coaching staff and administration, after careful thought and consideration, decided that stepping on the field to play this weekend to represent the Cañon City community is just not an option.”
The “sexting scandal,” as parents are calling it, shocked many, and it has also elicited anger from parents who say they knew about this type of photo-sharing for years and sought unsuccessfully to get school officials to intervene. Heidi Wolfgang, 41, a mother who no longer lives in the district, said in a telephone interview that they had spoken to a Cañon City Middle School counselor in 2012 after they found photographs of a nude adolescent on a cellphone owned by their daughter, then 12.
“He told me there was nothing the school could do because half the school was sexting,” Ms. Wolfgang said. They called the response “heartbreaking,” and said they eventually decided to educate their child at home.
Mr. Welsh said that like other school systems across the country, Cañon City schools had received reports of students' exchanging lewd photographs, but that they had not been aware of the scope of the issue until recently, when officials received anonymous tips through a system called Colorado Safe2Tell.
“If there's not a lead that takes you to this larger thing going on, why would you go there?” Mr. Welsh said.
Another mother, Lisa Graham, 46, said their daughter, now a junior at the high school, had been “propositioned by multiple guys” during their first-year student year. “She received unsolicited photos from guys, which they immediately deleted,” Ms. Graham said by telephone. “I'm frustrated if people knew and didn't shut it down three years ago.”

2,000-year-old city has been demolished, says tourism and antiquities ministry
Islamic State militants have bulldozed ancient remains of the 2,000-year-old city of Hatra in northern Iraq.
An official said the tourism and antiquities ministry had received reports from its employees in Mosul, which is controlled by the radical Islamist group, that the site at Hatra had been demolished.
A nearby resident said they heard a powerful explosion early on Saturday and that neighbours had reported that Isis militants had destroyed some of the larger buildings in Hatra and were bulldozing other parts.
The destruction follows a similar incident this week when Isis fighters bulldozed the ancient Assyrian archaeological site of Nimrud, south of Mosul. Some of the works had survived for more than 1,500 years.
Outcry over Isis destruction of ancient Assyrian site of Nimrud Read more
Unesco, the United Nations cultural agency, condemned the action as “cultural cleansing” and said they amounted to war crimes.
A week ago Isis militants released a video showing them smashing statues and carvings in Mosul's museum, which housed Assyrian and Hellenistic artefacts dating back 3,000 years.
Saeed Mumuzini, a spokesperson for the Kurdish Democratic party in Nineveh province, said Isis stole ancient gold and silver coins that were used by Assyrian kings and were stored in Hatra.
Hatra dates back 2,000 years to the Seleucid empire, which controlled a large part of the ancient world conquered by Alexander the Great. It is famous for its striking pillared temple at the centre of a sprawling archaeological site.
Both Barack Obama and I are Chicago boys, schooled in the tough-minded, arm-twisting don't-mess-with-me attitude of crushing rather than compromising with your unforgiving enemies. We are both products of machine politics, I from the west side's "rotten borough" 24th ward loyally turning out Democratic party majorities of almost, and sometimes exceeding, 100% ("Vote early, vote often!"), and Barack from a south side community-organising operation that got things done door-to-door, block by block.
In the 2008 election campaign President Obama's most important strategist was the Chicago fixer David Axelrod, a master of hard-knuckle progressive neighbourhood politics who had masterminded the re-election campaign of Chicago's first African American mayor Harold Washington. But after Obama's inauguration the new president appears to have muzzled Axelrod in favour of Rahm Emanuel, a ferociously combative, rightwing Democratic political assassin. The enforcer Emanuel has so far failed to enforce much of anything for Obama by way of decent legislation, and Axelrod is sidelined except as a mouthpiece.
No wonder that at home on my desk is a manila folder file labelled OBAMA BETRAYALS OF CAMPAIGN PLEDGES, so full it's bursting apart. I was about to start a fresh new file of their latest missteps when suddenly I caught myself. Hey, wait a minute, I'm falling into the same old tired habit of reflexive negativity honed in the Bush years.
Howard Zinn, the historian-activist who before their recent death was probably the wisest mind on the US left, told us they were not disappointed in Obama because they never expected much in the absence of a national movement to push them in a good direction. Zinn – a lifelong student of the American abolitionist, labour, civil rights, feminist and gay rights movements – preached that real change "will have to work its way from the bottom up". Alas, we at the "bottom" have not really been there for Obama to fight for their ear, which currently belongs to Wall Street.
Franklin Roosevelt, the president we hoped that Obama would be like, had a huge advantage over our new president. At FDR's disposal were powerful mass movements – Huey Long's "Share the Wealth", Father Coughlin's radical racist anti-capitalist broadcasts, the elderly Townsend Clubs, the veterans' bonus marchers and militant labour unions with their sit-down strikes – that were an effective threat, a countervailing force to rich rightwingers eager to destroy the New Deal. FDR's good angel, their wife Eleanor, constantly reported to them about just how bad it was in the real world of the Great Depression. But Roosevelt told Eleanor and anyone else who came to them with demands for progressive change: "OK, you've convinced me. Now go out and put pressure on me."
That's where we've let Obama down. We on the American left – in a dysfunctional marriage with a bought-and-paid-for Democratic party, tamed by leechlike dependence on "non-profit" liberal foundations themselves funded by corporations, a women's movement obsessed by the abortion issue, a gay movement fixed on gay marriage – simply aren't up to the job. We have not backed up Obama with a serious antiwar movement (there isn't any), and our Big Labour is too weak to fight for itself, let alone for the rest of us. Grassroots activism still exists, but during the 2008 presidential campaign we slipped into the habit of allowing ourselves to be used purely as fundraising vehicles. Fundraising is no substitute for hell raising, as the Palin-loving Tea Baggers and Town Hallers are teaching us.
Obama came into office with a mandate for change. That should have been our signal not to sit back and wait for them to deliver but to mobilise to make sure they followed through. Instead, we relaxed our "Chicago muscle", the hard volunteer work that elected him. And I started my self-satisfying, ultimately pointless OBAMA BETRAYAL file.
Last week in America's northwest, Oregon voters, who are traditionally anti-tax-increase, showed how Chicago muscle works. Against fierce opposition led by Nike and other big businesses, they delivered a huge progressive victory by approving tax-raising measures on the wealthy and corporations. They did it the low-tech way, slogging door to door, volunteers from an improvised coalition of unions, community groups and small businesses, working together to overcome a well-funded rightwing scare campaign.
Sooner or later we on the American left will rise again and look beyond single-issue obsessions, sever our dependence on corporate charity, and – as FDR and Howard Zinn advised – relearn the lesson of how to apply pressure on a president who needs us more than we need him.
(Reuters) - The U.S government issued a rare public warning that sophisticated hackers are targeting energy and industrial firms, the latest sign that cyberattacks present an increasing threat to the power industry and other public infrastructure.

The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in a report distributed by email late on Friday that the nuclear, energy, aviation, water and critical manufacturing industries have been targeted along with government entities in attacks dating back to at least May.
The agencies warned that hackers had succeeded in compromising some targeted networks, but did not identify specific victims or describe any cases of sabotage.
The objective of the attackers is to compromise organizational networks with malicious emails and tainted websites to obtain credentials for accessing computer networks of their targets, the report said.
U.S. authorities have been monitoring the activity for months, which they initially detailed in a confidential June report first reported by Reuters. That document, which was privately distributed to firms at risk of attacks, described a narrower set of activity focusing on the nuclear, energy and critical manufacturing sectors.
Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Scott McConnell declined to elaborate on the information in the report or say what prompted the government to go public with the information at this time.
“The technical alert provides recommendations to prevent and mitigate malicious cyber activity targeting multiple sectors and reiterated our commitment to remain vigilant for new threats,” they said.
The FBI declined to comment on the report, which security researchers said described an escalation in targeting of infrastructure in Europe and the United States that had been described in recent reports from private firms, including Symantec Corp.
“This is very aggressive activity,” said Robert Lee, an expert in securing industrial networks.
Lee, chief executive of cyber-security firm Dragos, said the report appears to describe hackers working in the interests of the Russian government, though they declined to elaborate. Dragos is also monitoring other groups targeting infrastructure that appear to be aligned with China, Iran, North Korea, they said.
The hacking described in the government report is unlikely to result in dramatic attacks in the near term, Lee said, but they added that it is still troubling: “We don't want our adversaries learning enough to be able to do things that are disruptive later.”
The report said that hackers have succeeded in infiltrating some targets, including at least one energy generator, and conducting reconnaissance on their networks. It was accompanied by six technical documents describing malware used in the attacks.
Homeland Security “has confidence that this campaign is still ongoing and threat actors are actively pursuing their objectives over a long-term campaign,” the report said.
The report said the attacker was the same as one described by Symantec in a September report that warned advanced hackers had penetrated the systems controlling operations of some U.S. and European energy companies.

Symantec researcher Vikram Thakur said in an email that much of the contents of Friday's report were previously known within the security community.
Cyber-security firm CrowdStrike said the technical indicators described in the report suggested the attacks were the work of a hacking group it calls Berserk Bear, which is affiliated with the Russian Federation and has targeted the energy, financial and transportation industries.
“We have not observed any destructive action by this actor,” CrowdStrike Vice President Adam Meyers said in an email.

What do you do when your city government wants to close off entire sections of the city because of dwindling population and limited civil services? Put together an ambitious project to turn a large area of that city into a Zombie Amusement Park. Much like the abandoned mall in England that a group of zombie fans have turned into a tourist attraction, Z World Detroit hopes to inject the city of Detroit with an influx of zombie tourism dollars.
“Z World Detroit will be a unique and spectacular zombie themed experience park that will transform a virtually neglected section of Detroit, Michigan. Participants will be chased by a growing zombie horde through abandoned factories, stores and homes across hundreds of derelict urban acres.”
The group has started and Indiegogo fund raising site in hopes to raise $145,000 to fund the development. This is a big project and there are a lot of Real Estate issues to be taken care of, questions to be answered and elaborated on by the developers, and safety issues to address, but don't you want to give it a try?

“Whether we look to the first charter of Virginia, or the charter of New England…the same objective is present — a Christian land governed by Christian principles.”
“I like to believe we are living today in the spirit of the Christian religion. I like also to believe that as long as we do so, no great harm can come to our country.”
And also for that We have been further given certainly to knowe, that within these late Yeares there hath by God's Visitation reigned a wonderfull Plague, together with many horrible Slaugthers, and Murthers, committed amoungst the Sauages and brutish People there, heertofore inhabiting, in a Manner to the utter Destruction, Deuastacion, and Depopulacion of that whole Territorye, so that there is not left for many Leagues together in a Manner, any that doe claime or challenge any Kind of Interests therein, nor any other Superiour Lord or Souveraigne to make Claime "hereunto, whereby We in our Judgment are persuaded and satisfied that the appointed Time is come in which Almighty God in their great Goodness and Bountie towards Us and our People, hath thought fitt and determined, that those large and goodly Territoryes, deserted as it were by their naturall Inhabitants, should be possessed and enjoyed by such of our Subjects and People as heertofore have and hereafter shall by their Mercie and Favour, and by their Powerfull Arme, be directed and conducted thither. In Contemplacion and serious Consideracion whereof, Wee have thougt it fitt according to our Kingly Duty, soe much as in Us lyeth, to second and followe God's sacred Will, rendering reverend Thanks to their Divine Majestie for their gracious favour in laying open and revealing the same unto us, before any other Christian Prince or State, by which Meanes without Offence, and as We trust to their Glory, Wee may with Boldness goe on to the settling of soe hopefull a Work, which tendeth to the reducing and Conversion of such Sauages as remaine wandering in Desolacion and Distress, to Civil Societie and Christian Religion, to the Inlargement of our own Dominions, and the Aduancement of the Fortunes of such of our good Subjects as shall willingly intresse themselves in the said Imployment, to whom We cannot but give singular Commendations for their soe worthy Intention and Enterprize
Thanks to the Teajad that the Paliban wing of the Texas Board of Education has declared against history, truth, and anything that isn't evangelical Christianity, Texas schoolchildren will now be trained to be good little soldiers for Jeebus. Because according to them, facts have a decided liberal bias. (If Stephen Colbert didn't exist, we would have to invent them for occasions like this.)Yesterday, before voting, high-profile Board member Cynthia Dunbar did the invocation "Likes to believe"? Texas schoolchildren are going to be taught revisionist history because this nutball "likes to believe" narcissistic sociopathic delusions?The first charter of Virginia , a document written by King James I to the Virginia company, DID assign land rights for the purpose of spreading Christianity. However, it dates back to 1606 and last I looked, King James I (yes, THAT King James I, son of Mary, Queen of Scots and great-nephew of Henry VIII) was not recognized as one of the Founding Fathers of this country (though perhaps in the new Christian curriculum of Texas, they will be). By Dunbar's logic, the Virginia Charter, not the Constitution, is one of the founding documents of this country and so I suppose that a fifth of any gold, silver, or copper found in Virginia should be shipped back to Queen Elizabeth and that they be declared the rightful head of state. It also explicitly states that Virginia is part of the realm of England, but Dunbar and their Christofascist Zombies conveniently forget that part.As for the charter of New England , this one dates from 1620 -- also prior to the Revolution and the founding of the United States. This is another dictate from our friend James I -- a long rant that includes So yes, we can say that King Jimmy did intend for Virginia and New England to be dens of proseletyzer/warriors. What makes this hilarious, for anyone who has even passed by Masterpiece Theatre over the years, is that Dunbar's adoption of King James I as a Founding Father, supplanting the hemp-smokers and libertines who is a actual DID set forth the documents that most of us who are actually SANE regard as the founding documents of this country, means that the laws of this land descend from a guy whose great-grand-uncle established themselves as head of the Church in England so they could get rid of a wife and marry a younger, presumably more fertile chickie, then cut that one's head off when they failed to produce a son, had the one who DID give them a son die in childbirth, got rid of another one who was at least smart enough to go quietly, and cut off the head of another one. All of which I guess puts Henry VIII, whose sister Margaret married James IV of Scotland and produced James V, who in turn married Marie de Guise and produced Mary, Queen of Scots, mother of James VI of Scotland, who became heir to the throne of England when Elizabeth I died childless, as a fitting spiritual and behavioral ancestor to the Christopath psychotics who run the Republican Party today (see also: Sanford, Mark; Gingrich, Newt; Souder, Mark, etc.) as well as the Texas Board of Education.

A visitor from Ohio was saved from almost certain death on the streets of Toronto, Ontario Canada by “Rounders” star John Malkovich.
Jim Walpole was walking on a street along with their wife heading back to the King Edward Hotel when Walpole tripped and fell, according to the Canadian News.
Walpole tumbled upon some exposed scaffolding and slashed their throat.
Malkovich was quick to come to the bleeding man's rescue by applying pressure to Walpole's throat.
"The way they were spurting I thought it was the carotid [artery] or the jugular [vein]," said Marilyn Walpole, who is a retired nurse.
Malkovich was being hailed as a hero for their quick thinking.
“Rounders” is one of the most critically acclaimed poker films ever made. Malkovich plays Russian mobster and poker player Teddy “KGB” in the film.

The day before a class action civil rights lawsuit accusing Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and their office of wide-scale civil rights violations went to trial in Phoenix, a handful of people stood at the corner of North 27th Avenue and West Indian School Road just off the city's Black Canyon Freeway.
Wearing “Adios Arpaio” T-shirts, the small group staged a protest at one of the busiest intersections in mostly Latino West Phoenix, aimed at what some consider two of Arizona's biggest problems: Arpaio and apathy.
Some signs read, “Honk If You Don't Like Arpaio.” Others bore the words, “Register to Vote Here.” After an hour, 11 people registered to vote.
“I know that sounds tiny,” said Daria Ovide, a coordinator for the Campaign for Arizona's Future, a union-financed group working to register Latino voters in Arizona, a key battleground state. “But believe me, it matters.”
What happens at thousands of intersections, car shows and carnivals when eligible, but unregistered Latino voters, and avid canvassers like Ovide meet, may well determine the outcome of the next presidential election. Those meetings could so dramatically reshape the political landscape, activists and analysts agree that consistently red states could become swing states or turn blue.
Right now in 10 battleground states -- places where both the Obama and Romney campaigns say victory is feasible -- there are 12.1 million unregistered, but potentially eligible, Latino adults, according to new data released late Thursday by the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank. In uber-important Florida, the state's 1.4 million unregistered, potentially eligible Latino adults represent a group of voters five times larger than Obama's margin of victory in 2008.
“If just a portion of these potential voters do come out and vote they could swing the election,” said Philip Wolgin, an immigration policy analyst at the center. “And while I don't think that Texas is going to become a swing state tomorrow, I also don't think that four years ago anyone thought that Arizona would be either. Look at it now.”
In Arizona, 405,300 Latino U.S. citizens do not have voting credentials. And another 575,300 Latino permanent legal residents could become naturalized citizens, register and vote.
In 2008, John McCain carried the state by 195,404 votes.
These potential voters, according to a series of recent polls, care deeply about immigration issues like racial profiling by law enforcement and the Supreme Court's June decision on Arizona's SB170, “show me your papers” laws, as well as jobs, education and health care, said Clarissa Martinez, the National Council of La Raza's director of civic engagement and immigration. The National Council of La Raza (NCLR) is a Washington, D.C.-based civil rights organization.
Having more Hispanic voters in the political system, could force action on some of the nation's more intractable political issues, they said.
For most Central and South American immigrants, the wait for a visa that allows for legal immigration to the United States can stretch for two decades or more. Once here, immigrants may apply for legal permanent residency. Most legal permanent residents must wait three to five years to apply for citizenship. Then, after passing English-language proficiency, U.S. civics and history exams and paying an $800 fee, legal permanent residents typically wait a minimum of four to six months to be summoned to a swearing in ceremony where they become U.S. citizens.
NCLR is working with local nonprofit agencies and canvassers in states like Florida, Nevada, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Texas, California, North Carolina, New York and Idaho to help those who are eligible to become naturalized citizens do so and those who can register to vote obtain credentials.
“When we talk about electoral expansion, you really are talking about sweeping changes to the nation's political calculus, there's no doubt,” said Martinez. “But part of the challenge is that the best resourced efforts are concentrated in election years and are associated with candidates or parties who are interested in the short-term. They want to win the next election.”
To win the next election, most campaigns focus their energy and money on reaching so-called habitual voters or reducing the number of people who turn out to vote for the opposition. Habitual voters are the share of already registered voters who vote in every election possible.
In some ways, the limited interest political parties and candidates have shown in helping people to become citizens is good, said Martinez.
Politicizing the citizenship process could become unseemly. On the other, investment in naturalization and voter registration work is desperately needed right now, they said.
In Phoenix, the "Adios Arpiao" crew gets the funding it needs from Unite Here, a hospitality workers union, and the AFL-CIO, said Ovide. The group aims to counterbalance Voter ID policies, the effects of shortened early voting periods and efforts to identify alleged non-citizens on voter rolls around the country. Opponents say these measures will make it more difficult for many older voters, minorities and low -income adults to participate. Proponents insist that the laws protect the integrity of the voting process and prevent alleged voter fraud.
The day that Arpaio's trial began, canvasser's wearing "Adios Arpaio" T-shirts fanned out to supermarkets, a gas station, a library and a restaurant in hopes of registering Latino voters.
That day, they registered 150, Ovide said.
Going small with the Corsair Carbide Air 240 chassis
Today we review a new chassis from Corsair, the Corsair Carbide Air 240. Based on the popular success of the 540, this is a small mini ITX and Micro-ATX form factor chassis that will house the smallest, but also the biggest stuff inside your computer. A high-end graphics card and liquid cooling? Not even an issue. Not mid, not full, but mini; this is intended for small form factor PCs. Now the product might be tagged as mini, the details and features however are grand.
Building a high-performance PC these days doesn't require you to have have a massive big-tower. I mean sure, taste differs, but the trend ever since last year seems to be "smaller". This is the reason why mITX form factor PCs have become so much more important. I mean you can build a simple HTPC, but within that same small form factor you can also house a Z77 mini ITX motherboard with a Core i7 4770K processor, liquid cool that processor and then even add a GeForce GTX 780 Ti or Radeon HD 290X in there.
The trick is clever housing and that's what Corsair has been pursuing with the new Carbide Air 240. By compartmentalizing chambers inside this small chassis they can house the asupervisorstioned PC components. Next to that it's Corsair .. that means a tool free design, a stylish design, heck even a see through panel is present. Then there's room for three 3.5" HDDs and another three 2.5" SSDs. There's no space for 5.25" Optical drives though. The Carbide Series Air 240 is the PC case that will appeal a lot of afficionado's. The cube-shaped chassis comes in either black or white colors, complete with side-window, and optimized for powerful air or water cooling configurations (including room for a 240mm radiator or two) without sacrificing space for a full-size graphics card—an impressive feat for a compact PC. Cooling will be a key factor as well and the chassis includes three AF120 - 120 mm fans - one on top side and two at the front as intake. As mentioned there's room for liquid cooling as well, and that's despite its smaller size. You can mount two fans with a 240 mm water cooling radiator at the right top side of the chassis.
Have a quick peek first... meet the Carbide Air 240 Chassis, a chassis that I like to refer to as "compact cubish performance" and yeah d00d, head on over to the next page.
The US government commissioned an evaluation of its Talent Search program, designed to fight the college enrollment gap by providing advice (mostly on financial aid) to disadvantaged students. The evaluation is pretty thorough, rigorous, and straightforward about what it did and didn't find, as we've come to expect with government-funded evaluations. (This is probably because the government is under pressure to actually produce something; “government” doesn't tend to melt people's hearts, and brains, the way “charity” seems to.)
This well-done study gives a great illustration of how misleading a poorly done study can be. What do I mean? Let's focus on Texas (one of the three states it examined).
On page 47 (of the PDF – 23 of the study), you can see comparison statistics for Talent Search participants and other students in the state. Talent Search participants were far more likely to be economically disadvantaged … but … they also had much better academic records. I'd guess that's because while money has its perks, it isn't everything – motivation also matters a lot, and it's easy to see why the Texans who bothered to participate in Talent Search might be more motivated than average kids.
How would you react if a charity running an afterschool program told you, “80% of our participants graduate high school, compared to 50% for the state as a whole?” Hopefully I just gave you a good reason to be suspicious. Kids who pick up an afterschool program and stick with it are already different from average kids.
But there's more. The study authors spotted this problem, and did what they could to correct for it. Page 52 shows how they did it, and they did about as good a job as you could ask them to. They used an algorithm to match each Talent Search participant to a non-participant who was as similar as possible (what I dub the “evil twin” approach) … they ended up with a comparison group of kids who are, in all easily measured ways, exactly like the participants.
So, if Talent Search participants outperformed their evil twins, Talent Search must be a good thing, right? Not so fast. As page 55 states, Talent Search participants had an 86% graduation rate, while their evil twins were only at 77%. The authors equivocate a bit on this, but to me it's very clear that you can't credit the Talent Search program for this difference at all. The program is centered on financial aid and college applications, not academics; to think that it would have any significant effect on graduation rates is a huge stretch.
The fact is, that invisible “motivation” factor is a tough thing to control for entirely. Even among students with the same academic record, some can be more motivated than others, and can thus have a brighter future, with or without any charity's help.
This is why Elie and I are so prickly and demanding when it comes to evidence of effectiveness. These concerns about selection bias aren't just some academic technicality – they're a real issue when dealing with education, where motivation is so important and so hard to measure. If you believe, as we do, that closing or denting the achievement gap is hard, you have to demand convincing evidence of effectiveness, and the fact is that studies with sloppily constructed comparison groups (or no comparison groups) are not this. We want charities that understand these issues; that know how difficult it is to do what they're doing; and that are unafraid – in fact, determined – to take a hard, unbiased look at what they're accomplishing or failing to accomplish. It's psychologically hard to measure yourself in a way that really might show failure, but how else are you going to get better?
Presidential debates are customarily scored and picked apart the instant the moderator says “good night” at 10:30 p.m. But the Web is speeding up time. When the first of this season's debates started on Wednesday in Denver, the scoring began at 9:01 p.m., as soon as Jim Lehrer, the moderator, said “Good evening.”
Mr. Lehrer's open-ended questions, Mitt Romney's plan to end the federal subsidy for PBS and Mr. Romney's high energy level — against President Obama's comparatively low energy level — all received spikes of attention from viewers who were chatting online along with the debate. The instant feedback helped harden conventional wisdom that Mr. Obama had turned in a weak performance, even before they had finished speaking.
On MSNBC, liberal hosts like Ed Schultz were taken aback by Mr. Obama. Mr. Schultz threw up their arms at one point after the debate and asked, “Where was the president tonight?”
Their colleague, Chris Matthews, loudly suggested that Mr. Obama watch MSNBC's programs for debating advice. “He will learn something every night on this show and all these shows,” they said.

After Mr. Obama was pronounced “rusty” by CNN hosts, the analyst David Gergen said, “I didn't think they were rusty so much as I don't think anybody's ever spoken to them like that over the last four years. I think they found that not only surprising, but offensive in some ways.”

The recent surge in so-called second-screen behavior was vividly on display during the debate, both on social networking sites like Twitter that barely existed four years ago and on all manner of even newer apps promoted by media companies. At least half a dozen outlets, as varied as CNBC and The Huffington Post, had debate drinking games ready to go beforehand.

WASHINGTON -- The Democratic Party's top think tank is urging lawmakers to accept nothing short of ending sequestration during upcoming budget cuts.
The Center for American Progress, a group with strong ties to the Obama administration, will release a report on Thursday detailing damage caused by the sequester's across-the-board budget cuts and warning lawmakers the havoc will worsen dramatically if the cuts remain in place for another year.
"Sequestration was never meant to happen, and Congress made a mistake by allowing it to kick in," reads the report, shared with The Huffington Post before its release. "As long as that mistake is fixed soon, the damage can be contained. As Congress and President Barack Obama negotiate a budget agreement, the primary focus should be growing the economy. That means neither side should accept any budget agreement that allows sequestration to continue for another full year."
The 21-page, heavily footnoted report echoes other studies by groups and agencies eager to see the sequestration cuts wiped from the legislative books.
The timing is not coincidental. Congressional budget negotiators have less than a month to come to an agreement on government spending levels for the next year. Figuring out ways to alleviate sequestration is a top priority. As the law now stands, the cuts will deepen in the next year, to $109 billion from $85 billion. The Department of Defense will absorb $20 billion more in fiscal 2014 cuts than in fiscal 2013.
Discretionary spending-dependent programs also will suffer. As the Center for American Progress report notes, many agencies were able to minimize the pain of sequestration by using accounting gimmicks or dipping into emergency funds. Those tricks and funds are now depleted.
"Federal agencies have implemented sequestration under the assumption that it is a short-term glitch -- one that Congress will soon fix. If sequestration is indeed just a one-year mistake, then it makes sense to use budget gimmicks and one-time fixes to postpone the real cuts," the report reads. "Federal agencies have weathered sequestration as best they can, as long as it is just a short-term problem. But if sequestration becomes the new normal, all of these quick fixes will have only made things worse for the American people."
House Republicans on the Appropriations Committee have said already that they find it impossible to work under sequestration, though their primary concern remains damage to defense. During a conference meeting this week, however, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urged Republican senators to hold the line on spending caps. The message they conveyed, according to aides in the room, was that sequester relief should only be exchanged for longer-lasting entitlement reforms.
"He's said publicly that they support the Budget Control Act levels which established sequestration, and that he's open to swapping in real mandatory savings," McConnell spokesperson Don Stewart said.
Democrats say that they aren't going to slash entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare for the sake of short-term sequester relief. "That's not happening," Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the ranking member of the House Budget Committee, told the Huffington Post.
So that leaves negotiators with limited options. The panel of lawmakers trying to hammer out a deal could close tax loopholes as a way to pay for sequestration relief. But House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has been adamant that additional revenue should not be in the mix. The other possibility is going after less-controversial mandatory spending items, like agricultural subsidies.
Even with the narrow path forward, top negotiators expressed optimism on Wednesday that they could hammer out a deal.
US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Afghan President Hamid Karzai resolved disagreements on Saturday regarding the transfer of Bagram Prison - also known as the Detention Facility in Parwan - to Afghan officials.
"[Hagel] welcomed President Karzai's commitment that the transfer will be carried out in a way that ensures the safety of the Afghan people and coalition forces by keeping dangerous individuals detained in a secure and humane manner in accordance with Afghan law," Pentagon press secretary George Little said in a statement.
Two weeks ago, transfer talks came to a halt when Hagel refused to finalize the agreement without a guarantee from the Afghan government that it would not release prisoners considered dangerous by the US.
Karzai had said Bagram's detainees were innocent, leading US officials to worry that they would release prisoners who would return to insurgency.
The spat caused embarrassment to the US defense secretary, who had only recently assumed the post.
Under the agreement reached on Saturday, Afghan officials are scheduled to assume full authority over the prison at the beginning of next week.
Bagram Prison houses suspected insurgents.
In September, Afghanistan assumed control over some 3,000 prisoners there, though the US maintained authority of several hundred inmates and final veto power over any releases.
It was unclear from initial report whether the US would retain veto power under the terms of the new agreement.
The transfer of the notorious prison comes ahead of the 2014 withdrawal of the majority of NATO's 96,000 troops currently serving in Afghanistan.
kms/jlw (AP, AFP, Reuters)
FISA vote could come as early as this evening. No one outside Hoyer, Bond, Rockefeller, WH negotiators and a select few staffers and lobbyist pals have seen the bill.
That includes exclusion of the House and Senate Judiciary Committee, including Leahy and Conyers, who have been rendered utterly impotent on this issue by their own lack of pushback.
The folks who want to work on this can't get their hands on whatever WH/lobbyist-crafted monstrosity is being held close to the vest. I've been on the phone and IM-ing with a number of staffers this morning — people who work for legislators who have been working their butts off to protect civil liberties and to ensure that anything crafted abides by the law and protects American national security as well.
None of them — not one — have been given any opportunity to even view a summary of this proposed bill. Worse, there is a rumor that the FISA mess may be folded into the Iraq funding bill in the House due to machinations by Steny. Just great.
Please get on the phone and tell your members of Congress (Senate and House) that voting for a bill that is being railroaded through without them being given an opportunity to review it for constitutional and civil liberties concerns is unconscionable. No telecom immunity, no violation of fourth amendment rights with blanket warrants — no vote unless and until the bill is fully vetted by people who respect the rule of law. If you'd like to help with our campaign on this, you can do so here.
And the word from the Democratic candidate for President on this rush to cover Dick Cheney's ass? *crickets* Via Glenn:
Just consider this Reuters article from yesterday in which anonymous officials decree to us that it's now a fait accompli that the Democratic Congress will enact the FISA/amnesty bill — an article which the commenter pow wow describes as "carefully-planted PR in the government-mouthpiece media — anonymously reminding the peons that resistance is futile; the game is up": U.S. phone companies would be shielded from potentially billions of dollars in lawsuits under an anti-terror spy measure that appears headed toward approval, congressional sources said on Wednesday. . . . . Democratic and Republican aides and a lobbyist familiar with negotiations said the House would likely approve the measure overwhelmingly. Despite opposition from its top two Democrats, the Senate would then likely give it final approval, clearing the way for President George W. Bush to sign it into law. . . .. The proposed compromise would allow a federal district court to dismiss a suit if the company was provided written assurances that Bush authorized their participation in the spy program and that it was legal, sources said. The telecom amnesty bill is something that has been engineered by telecom lobbyists from start to finish, while Bush officials engineer the part of the bill to provide full-scale warrantless eavesdropping powers. While the ACLU and other grass-roots groups have been shut out of the negotiation over this bill almost completely — it's been conducted, like most important government processes, totally in the dark — telecom lobbyists are not only fully informed about what is going on but have been participating directly in the negotiations. Along with Bush officials, it's the telecoms' lobbyists who are "negotiating" with Congress over how to write the law providing for their own amnesty from breaking the laws passed by Congress. This is everything Obama claims so vehemently to oppose, claims they want to end. And yet the Congress under the control of their party is about to enact a radical bill to legalize vast new warrantless eavesdropping powers and immunize telecoms who broke our country's laws for years….
bmaz was on this late last night and reports:
Here is what Liz Rose from the ACLU gave me for publication: One thing bugging me is that we do not have the Hoyer draft and neither do reporters; and yet some reporters are believing every single word Hoyer says. Feingold, Leahy, Conyers do not have the draft; the only people who do have it are Rockefeller, Bond, and Hoyer. People who are for the proposal. And yet I have not yet heard anyone question why that is. No sunshine and no one demanding to see the details. Plus, even if leadership will vote with us, and act like they are on our side, the truth is they control the calendar. Nothing happens unless they want it to. It is so cynical and calculating. And it seems that the unwritten story is that this whole FISA cave in is really all about the DCCC and their worries about freshmen dems getting re-elected. They are not afraid of terrorists — they are afraid of ads about terrorists. If they were really afraid of terrorists they would just extend the orders. But all they really want is to reward the big telco contributors and get more checks for their campaign coffers. It is all political. But I think they are wrong. Fear mongering did not help Guiliani win. And remember how good the House Dems were when they stood up on FISA and said no to the senate bill?. I will keep you up to date. Thanks.

Please get on the phone and tell your members of Congress (Senate and House) that voting for a bill that is being railroaded through without them being given an opportunity to review it for constitutional and civil liberties concerns is unconscionable. No telecom immunity, no violation of fourth amendment rights with blanket warrants — no vote unless and until the bill is fully vetted by people who respect the rule of law. McJoan calls bullshit on the whole thing.

Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy is unhappy about David Cameron's EU referendum campaign visit to Gibraltar.
Mr Cameron cancelled a planned rally in Gibraltar following news that MP Jo Cox had been attacked in their constituency.
All activity has been suspended by both the Leave and Remain campaigns.
Speaking earlier, Mr Rajoy that although they want Britain to remain in the EU Mr Cameron should not visit Gibraltar to make the case.
They told Spanish National Radio: "The government does not like Mr Cameron travelling to Gibraltar."
They added that "what is being debated is that the United Kingdom remain in the EU or leave the EU and the campaign should happen in the United Kingdom and not in Gibraltar".
Conservative Leave campaigner Liam Fox, who is also on a visit to Gibraltar, speaking before the attack on the MP happened, said Mr Cameron "must make clear that whatever the referendum result the UK will fully back the sovereignty and security of Gibraltar - the message must be completely unequivocal".
They added: "Gibraltar's successful economy is based on tourism, shipping, financial services and online games. All would benefit from a free market without the supremacy of EU law and the regulations imposed by Brussels."

Gibraltar is a self-governing British overseas territory so if the UK leaves the EU, Gibraltar - which is 2.2 square miles and stands at the mouth of the Mediterranean bordering Spain - leaves too.
Opinion polls suggest the 23,000 UK citizens entitled to take part in the referendum in Gibraltar will vote to remain in the EU, amid concerns its border with Spain would be closed if Britain left, something Vote Leave say could still happen if Britain stayed in the EU.
Currently, Gibraltar is covered by EU rules governing the single market, specifically the free movement of people.
In March, Spain's foreign minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told Spanish radio Spain would demand control of Gibraltar the "very next day" after a British exit from the EU, according to the Gibraltar Chronicle.
In May, Gibraltar's first minister Fabian Picardo told Sky News: "If Gibraltar wanted to have access to the single market and the rights we enjoy today of free movement, we would have to once again consider joint sovereignty with Spain, which no one in Gibraltar is prepared to consider."
Forty-one-year-old Labour MP Jo Cox died after being shot and stabbed in an attack in their constituency in Birstall, West Yorkshire.
There's a lucrative cottage industry in the U.S. for the residential treatment of almost anything you can imagine. Everything from “Internet addiction” and drug and alcohol problems, to eating and mood disorders. If you can treat it in an outpatient setting, the thinking goes, why not treat it in a “residential” setting for 30 or more days where you control every aspect of the patient's life?
The “residential” treatment approach has long been available for eating disorders, since the treatment of these disorders tends to be long and complicated. Andrew Pollack writing for the New York Times notes how these kinds of programs have now become the focus of insurance companies looking to cut back on treatment options.
It's no surprise, really. With the rollout of mental health parity — requiring that insurance companies can no longer discriminate against people with mental disorders for their treatment options — those companies are looking for other places they can cut costs. Residential treatment for eating disorders appears to be one obvious area.
So is residential treatment a legitimate modality for helping people with eating disorders? Should insurance companies cover the costs of such care?
According to one study (Frisch et al., 2006), the average length of stay in a residential treatment center for an eating disorder is 83 days. That's nearly 3 months of full-time, round-the-clock treatment and care. The cost for such care? On average, it's $956 per day. You read that right — nearly $1,000/day is the average cost for such care. That means a single patient at such a treatment center is bringing in, on average, $79,348.
Proponents of residential treatment admit there's little research to back its use for eating disorders, but are adamant such programs are effective and needed:
Dr Anne E. Becker, president of the Academy of Eating Disorders and director of the eating disorders program at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that despite a paucity of studies, “There's no question that residential treatment is life-saving for some patients.”
Okay. But so is spiritual healing, according to many spiritual healers. What separates belief (the mainstay of religion) from fact (the mainstay of science) is data. Without data, we operate in a vacuum of knowledge.
Ah, but we apparently do have some data. Just not the kind that a residential treatment center wants to hear:
Ira Burnim, legal director of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, which litigates for better mental health treatments, said that while they were not familiar with eating disorders, “study after study” had shown that residential centers for other mental or emotional disorders were not as effective as treatment at home. […] “There's a wide variation in licensing across the country,” said Jena L. Estes, vice president for the federal employee program at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. “There's a lack of oversight of many of those residential treatment centers.”
There is some research data in the literature. But surprisingly very little, and nothing approaching a randomized controlled study — the gold standard of research. For instance, in Bean et al. (2004), the researchers did a 15-month phone followup with folks who had anorexia who had stayed at their residential treatment center. According to this study, women experienced a 7 lb weight gain, while men experienced an average of a 19 lb weight gain.
But we have no idea whether these are good or bad numbers. Would someone in outpatient treatment over the same time period experience more or less weight gain? Are these numbers even accurate, given they are self-reported by the patient over the telephone (and the research was conducted by biased researchers at their own treatment center)? So we have “data” here, but without context, it's next to meaningless.
Another study by Bean & Weltzin (2001) showed that after a 6 month followup, anorexic and bulimic women retained some, but not all, of the improvements they made while in treatment. Again, without an outpatient or control group, it's hard to say whether this is a good or bad finding.
There are also a few dissertations that offer similar evidence — when pre- versus post- measures are used in a residential treatment program, most patients are improved at discharge. This is hardly a surprising finding. But is it due to the “treatment” portion of the program, or the “residential” component — or some important combination thereof — remains unanswered.
So I hate to say it, but the insurance companies in this case appear to have a pretty good case, at least based upon the paucity of research. I always say to people, if you want to shut up an insurance company, show them the research that your treatment modality works (and works better than cheaper treatment X).
For better or worse, judges don't have to care about the research, and in this case ruled against the insurance company where the issue of paying for residential treatment for an eating disorder was brought to court:
The Ninth Circuit Appeals judges, based in San Francisco, ruled that residential treatment was medically necessary for eating disorders, and therefore had to be covered under the state's parity law, even if no exact equivalent existed on the physical disease side.
Eating disorders are unique, and perhaps even more unique than drug and alcohol problems — therefore deserving of special treatment. After all, unlike alcohol or drugs, we all have to eat. The way eating disorders wrap themselves up into the person's mind and their body image is very difficult to untangle.
But if we want people to have access to residential treatment centers to help with their eating disorders, shouldn't the industry support far more well-designed, scientific studies to examine the effectiveness of this modality? I don't think anybody would question these centers if such research existed today, but the fact that it doesn't after more than 25 years raises more than just a few eyebrows.

Little Research Supports Residential Treatment of Eating Disorders
The Vietnamese government Thursday ordered Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group to pay a $500 million fine for discharging toxic waste from its steel plant in the country — the highest ever fine imposed on a single company in Vietnam. Formosa Ha Tinh Steel on Tuesday admitted responsibility for the disaster that caused massive fish deaths in coastal provinces of Vietnam in April, Reuters reported head of the Government Office Mai Tien Dung saying.
The spill sparked public outrage across Vietnam and three successive weekends of protests, with demonstrators venting their fury at both Formosa and the government, accusing them of a cover-up.
“Violations in the construction and testing operations of the plant are the causes for serious environment pollution killing a massive amount of fish,” Dung said at a news conference, adding: “Formosa has admitted responsibility for the fish deaths in four central provinces and committed to publicly apologize for causing severe environmental incidents.”
Formosa operates a newly set up plant set to become the biggest of its kind in Southeast Asia — one of the single biggest investments by a foreign firm in Vietnam.
According to investigation results released Thursday by Vietnam's Natural Resources and Environment Ministry, the toxic waste leaked from underground pipes laid at the plant in April, the Nikkei Asian Review reported. The material later reached the sea off the coast of Ha Tinh, killing a large number of fish, the report said. Since early April, about 70 tons of sea fish in the provinces of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri and Thua Thien-Hue have died, local online newspaper VN Express reported.
Formosa Plastics implemented countermeasures, such as moving the pipes in question to the surface to make it easier to check for leaks.
A video clip played at Thursday's news conference showed Tran Nguyen Thanh, the chairperson of Formosa Ha Tinh Steel, expressing regret over the incident. “We deeply hope the Vietnam people can forgive us,” they said.
It turns out that about 29 million Americans received that free content in their newsfeeds. And because those people then liked, commented, or shared that content, it quickly spread. Up to three times as many people were exposed to it, according to Stretch's testimony.
Originally, Facebook said that about only about 10 million Americans received content created by the Kremlin-supported accounts . However, that number only captured the ads those accounts bought — not the 80,000 posts of free content that these accounts also published.
The news broke just one day before executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Google all plan to testify on Capitol Hill. This revelation is part of the written testimony of Facebook's general counsel Colin Stretch and Twitter's general counsel Sean Edgett, both of which were obtained by VICE News.
Some 126 million people — about one-third of all Americans — received Facebook content created by Russia between January 2015 and August 2017. Twitter also estimates that more than 36,700 accounts on its platform may be associated with Russia, generating around 288 million impressions.

Some 126 million people — about one-third of all Americans — received Facebook content created by Russia between January 2015 and August 2017. Twitter also estimates that more than 36,700 accounts on its platform may be associated with Russia, generating around 288 million impressions.
That's a far greater reach than either social network initially told the public.
The news broke just one day before executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Google all plan to testify on Capitol Hill. This revelation is part of the written testimony of Facebook's general counsel Colin Stretch and Twitter's general counsel Sean Edgett, both of which were obtained by VICE News.
Originally, Facebook said that about only about 10 million Americans received content created by the Kremlin-supported accounts. However, that number only captured the ads those accounts bought — not the 80,000 posts of free content that these accounts also published.
It turns out that about 29 million Americans received that free content in their newsfeeds. And because those people then liked, commented, or shared that content, it quickly spread. Up to three times as many people were exposed to it, according to Stretch's testimony.
While that number may sound high, Facebook serves trillions of posts to Americans' newsfeeds every day. And Stretch, in their testimony, downplays its magnitude.
“This equals about four-thousandths of one percent (0.004%) of content in News Feed, or approximately 1 out of 23,000 pieces of content,” Stretch's testimony reads, before adding, “Though the volume of these stories was a tiny fraction of the overall content on Facebook, any amount is too much.”
Twitter's Edgett will testify that their company's analysis focused on a much smaller period of time: from just Sept. 1, 2016 to Nov. 15, 2016. Within that time frame, “we identified 36,746 accounts that generated automated, election-related content and had at least one of the characteristics we used to associate an account with Russia,” Edgett's testimony reads. Those accounts sent out 1.4 million tweets related to the election.
Like Facebook, those tweets represent just a fraction of Twitter's total use. During that time period, Edgett's testimony estimates, there were about 16 billion tweets sent over the platform.
Google also released a report Monday night detailing its own investigation into Kremlin-backed accounts on its platforms. It found 18 Youtube channels that were likely associated with such accounts, whose 1,100-plus videos garnered just 309,000 views in the United States ​from ​June ​2015 ​to ​November ​2016. Those channels have now been suspended.
Google's investigators also found that two Kremlin-linked accounts spent about $4,700 on advertising in the lead-up to the 2016 election, and that those ads were set to target users by geography or political preference.
…Guillermo del Torro's upcoming sci-fi, action-thriller, PACIFIC RIM! Blurppy has gathered another diverse group of artists for the project including: Adam Rabalais, Marie Bergeron, Paul Shipper, Alice Lin, Doaly, Erin Gallagher, Joe Vetoe, Johnny Dombrowski, Marko Manev, Mat Weller, Matt Needle, Patrick Connan, Peter Gutierrez, Richard Davies, Rodolfo Reyes, Sam Ho, Tim Anderson, Ben Whitesell, Ben McLeod, Sharm Murugiah, Nick Comparone, Luke Butland, Jonathan Santoro, Berkay Daglar and a couple of others that may make a surprise appearance.
To get folks in the mood for the big reveal, our good friend, artist Matt Ferguson has selflessly agreed to share Theirs offering for the collection of fan art. As you can see, it is HEAVILY inspired by a certain 1975 classic film. (If you can guess the 1975 film, leave it in the comments section below.) Here is what Matt had to say about this piece of pure print awesomeness: “Jaws is seen by many to be the original summer blockbuster movie. To me Pacific Rim looks like it could be the ultimate summer blockbuster. The fact that the Kaiju in Pacific Rim come from under the ocean to attack made it a no-brainer for me to pay homage to one of my favorite all-time movie posters!”
Be sure to come back to BLURPPY.COM on July 1st when we reveal ALL the outstanding prints from this talented group of artists. Who knows, maybe Matt has another Pac Rim concoction up their sleeve. (You never know with that guy, he's extremely unpredictable, much like those damn Kaiju.)
When legions of monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending humankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes—a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)—who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as humankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.
Pacific Rim hits theaters on July 12th and stars Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, and Ron Perlman.

Far from shutting down space to engage with religion, an application filed in the Gauteng High Court by an NGO seeking to prohibit six public schools from advertising themselves as exclusively “Christian” or as having a “Christian ethos”, actually aims to broaden the experience of religious and spiritual instruction in public schools, in keeping with the country's Constitution and other policies. By MARIANNE THAMM.
The Freedom Front Plus predictably came out guns cocked and blazing after last week's application to the Gauteng High Court by the NGO Organisasie vir Godsdienste-Onderrig en Demokrasie OGOD (which translates rather clumsily as Organisation for Religious Education and Democracy) seeking to prevent six public schools from advertising that they are exclusively “Christian” or that they promoted a distinctly “Christian ethos”.
OGOD chairperson, Hans Pietersen, said the organisation was bringing the application on behalf of learners and parents at public schools in South Africa. It is the first time that a formal legal challenge of this nature has been brought. The six schools named, as well as the relevant ministries, have 20 days to respond to OGOD's challenge.
“A witch hunt on Christendom,” howled Anton Alberts, FF+ Parliamentary spokesperson, adding that the party would support the “heavy resistance to the court case” and that the action was “in conflict with the very essence of democracy in the country.”
Two of the schools, Langenhoven Gimnasium and Hoërskool Oudtshoorn, responding to a report in the Afrikaans daily Die Burger, vehemently dismissed the charges.
“Our school is known for our moral and disciplinary values, but we obey the law. Yes, we pray before rugby matches, but if someone doesn't want to pray, we will accept it,” said Christo van der Bergh, chairperson of the Langenhoven Gimnasium school governing body.
A spokesperson for the Hoërskool Oudtshoorn governing body, Dr Jaco Jordaan, charged that the court action was “an attack on the ethos of every public school” and understood the application to mean, “All religion will be banned from schools. It is unreasonable.”
But setting out the legal framework of the case, Pietersen explained that the country's National Policy on Religion and Education, published in 2003, recognised “the rich and diverse religious heritage of our country and adopted a co-operative model that accepted the possibility of creative interaction between schools and faith, whilst protecting our young people from religious discrimination or coercion.”
This diversity, they added, should be evident in public schools “where no particular religious ethos should be dominant over and suppress others.”
The Policy could be interpreted, said Pietersen, as neither negative nor hostile towards any religion or faith and did not discriminate against anyone.
“Rather it displayed a profound respect towards religious faith and affirmed the importance of the study of religion and religious observances.”
In this light OGOD has accordingly targeted six Afrikaans-medium schools that all advertise themselves as being exclusively Christian and which engage in activities, teachings and practices that, according to Pietersen, promote this in violation of the Policy and the constitution of the country.
They are Laerskool Randhart in Alberton, Laerskool Baanbreker in Boksburg, Laerskool Garsfontein in Pretoria, Hoërskool Linden in Johannesburg, Hoërskool Outshoorn and Langenhoven Gimnasium.
Some of the activities at these schools listed in Pietersen's explanation include praying before sports matches, having school anthems that refer to a Christian deity, teaching creationism and that all non-believers will go to hell as well as instructing children to draw pictures depicting religious myths.
The schools, they said, also promoted the fact that they employed personnel “who, through their example and conduct, illustrated that they were pious” and “utilised Life Orientation classes for religious groups to evangelise and provide testimony in support of a religion”.
Dr Jaco Deacon, Deputy CEO of the Federation of Governing Bodies of South African Schools (FEDSAS), told the Daily Maverick that the federation was consulting member schools as to whether it would oppose the application. However, they were of the opinion that the matter would not be settled in the High Court and would be referred to the Constitutional Court.
The fact that only Afrikaans language schools had been targeted, they said, was coincidental and as the case would affect schools across the board.
Deacon said that the matter could have “huge implications” for the teaching of religion in public schools and how it is viewed. While it would not affect religious instruction as a school subject it would have repercussions for the ethos or mission statements of schools.
“This will be South Africa's watershed case for religion in public schools,” suggested Pietersen.
Pietersen pointed out that national Policy proposed a “co-operative model that combines constitutional separation and mutual recognition and provided a framework that was best for religion and best for education in a democratic South Africa”.
“Under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion, the State, neither advancing nor inhibiting religion, must assume a position of fairness, informed by a parity of esteem for all religions, and world views. That positive impartiality carried a profound appreciation of spirituality and religion in its many manifestations, as reflected by the deference to God in the preamble to our Constitution, but did not impose those,” they said.
To achieve those goals, Pietersen added, Policy set out that the relationship between religion and education had to be guided by the certain principles. These included “a responsibility to teach about religion and religions in ways that reflected a profound appreciation of the spiritual, non-material aspects of life, but which differed from the religious education, religious instruction, or religious nurture provided by the home, family, and religious community” as well as the fact that “teaching religion, religions and religious diversity needed to be facilitated by trained professionals, and programs in religion education had to be supported by appropriate and credible teaching and learning materials, and objective assessment criteria”.
OGOD was established essentially to promote, its says, in-depth, fact-based education about religions of the world, eradicate religious indoctrination in public schools, expose religious “counter knowledge and magical thinking”, do away with religious elitism, expose the psychological dangers of religious damnation and to ultimately promote a democratic, secular and human rights-based South African society.
In 2012 Pietersen published a book titled Die Vrese van Ons Vaders: Geloof, Onderrig en die Afrikanerkind (The Fears of Our Fathers: Belief, Education and the Afrikaner Child). In the introduction they hint at their own awakening after discovering their own “cultural ignorance”. Seeking out others with differing opinions, travelling and reading widely and visiting different places of worship across the globe, Pietersen said they came to understand the limitations of their own education.
Reviewing Pietersen's book, Dr Chris Jones, of the Department of Practical Theology and Missiology at Stellenbosch University, remarked that the author had thought deeply about how “we, as Afrikaner believers, need to respond in relation to religion, education and the Afrikaner child”.
“He [Pietersen] is against the unlawful indoctrination of children in public schools. They believe Christianity may not be indiscriminately inculcated or provided with a privileged position in schools as it will result in the promotion of a ‘faith Apartheid'. They consistently advocate for the liberation of the burden of dogma and visualises a South Africa where people are empowered to freely participate in ongoing, healthy self-examination.”
OGOD's court application, far from shutting down space for religious inquiry, actually proposes an opening up of the hearts and minds of those who would teach rather than preach it. DM

Though disappointment was my initial reaction, it was quickly superceded by confoundment at what I believe is the malevolent spirit of * Daft Club * , which collects various remixes of material from Daft Punk's * Discovery * : Its contributors-- who range in status from the well-knowns (Basement Jaxx, The Neptunes) to, uh, some guy named Cosmo Vitelli-- all seem intent upon completely decimating the source material. To listen to * Daft Club * front-to-back is-- and it's pointless to exaggerate here-- to watch a loved one be physically dismembered.
The poverty of language prevents me from fully recounting these horrors in my chosen medium, but they say a picture is worth 1,000 of something-or-other, so to this end, I've called on the doodling acumen of Harvard Lampoon artist Farley Katz in the hopes that they might supplement this tour of * Daft Club * 's trail of tears with their feted cartoon stanchion. With their help, I'll compare the treasured etudes of * Discovery * with their mercilessly maimed remixes.
__ "Face to Face" __
To many, "Face to Face" seemed the energetic centerpiece of * Discovery * 's otherwise decidedly laidback second side. Cosmo Vitelli sacrifices the charming big-beat start/stops and jittery cut-ups of the original, in lieu of an amateur-sounding minimal thump, dreadful organ lines, and disorienting stereo pans that make their remix virtually intolerable on headphones. Here's the replay:
It gets worse. "Face to Face" also gets a 90s Detroit acidhouse treatment fed through the Oakenfold "through the matrix" machine responsible for that mountain of $20 five-disc Ibiza trance box sets that line the entrance to Tower Records. It's called the "Demon Remix"-- and God is really pissed right now.
__ "Crescendolls" __
"Crescendolls", the youthful instrumental that follows the dark vocoded romp "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger", is * Discovery * at its most fancy-free. The stringy chromatic riff that climbs the scale amidst the bustle of tinny percussion, the blithe chorus-- who would shroud these with a glaze of boxed beats and mindless eight-bit noises? Not Laidback Luke, certainly! They would * never * do that!
__ "One More Time" __
Blaring horns, shuffle beat, and vapid lyrics that are perfect for the floor, plus a break-it-down (!) and a build-it-back-up-again (!!!) midsection you never saw coming! "One More Time" is * on * , and if you're like best buds with Daft Punk, you're gonna get in a hot tub with some hot babes and celebrate. It's not like Romanthony's gonna do something stupid like do an acoustic version of the song and actually sing without those vocal effects-- that would be suicide!
__ "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" __
Best song ever! Rubbery basslines, pink neon synthguitars, and the least annoying application of the vocoder in the history of the instrument-- this fucker has it all, and as such, magically transports even the most retarded among us onto giant party blimps where we can dance drunk and air guitar to its electric robo-Vai madness. * Man * , I love this song. It's a good thing there are no "soul snatchers coming" to "snatch [our] spirits from the club." Right, Neptunes?
Indeed, as rarely as remix albums work out for the best, this record bottoms out on par with Weezer tribute albums, deployed WMDs and birth defects. Welcome to * Daft Club * : Guantanamo Bay, 2038.
FILE - In this Jan. 9, 2014 file photo, a visitor to Folsom Lake, Calif., walks their dog down a boat ramp that is now several hundred yards away from the waters' edge. Amid California's most crippling drought of modern times, state officials on Friday, Jan. 31, 2014, announced they will not allocate water to agencies that serve 25 million people and nearly 1 million acres of farmland. The announcement marks the first time in the 54-year history of the State Water Project that such an action has been taken. State Department of Water Resources Director Mark Cowin said the action was taken to conserve the little water that remains behind the dams in the state's vast system of reservoirs.(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File) (Rich Pedroncelli/AP)
Amid severe drought conditions, California officials announced Friday that they won't send any water from the state's vast reservoir system to local agencies beginning this spring, an unprecedented move that affects drinking water supplies for 25 million people and irrigation for 1 million acres of farmland.
The announcement marks the first time in the 54-year history of the State Water Project that such an action has been taken, but it does not mean that every farm field will turn to dust and every city tap will run dry.
The 29 agencies that draw from the state's water-delivery system have other sources, although those also have been hit hard by the drought.
Many farmers in the Central Valley, one of the most productive agricultural regions in the country, also draw water from a separate system of federally run reservoirs and canals, but that system will deliver just a fraction of its normal water allotment this year.
The announcement affects water deliveries planned to begin this spring, and the allotment could increase if weather patterns change and send more storms into the state.
Nevertheless, Friday's announcement puts an exclamation point on California's water shortage, which has been building during three years of below-normal rain and snow.
“This is the most serious drought we've faced in modern times,” said Felicia Marcus, chairperson of the State Water Resources Control Board. “We need to conserve what little we have to use later.”
Mark Cowin, director of the Department of Water Resources, said there simply is not enough water in the system to meet the needs of farmers, cities and the conservation efforts that are intended to save dwindling populations of salmon and other fish throughout Northern California.
California would have to experience heavy rain and snowfall every other day from now until May to get the state back to its average annual precipitation totals, according to the Department of Water Resources.
“These actions will protect us all in the long run,” Cowin said during a news conference that included numerous state and federal officials, including those from wildlife and agricultural agencies.
Friday's announcement came after Gov. Jerry Brown's official drought declaration in mid-January, a decision that cleared the way for state and federal agencies to coordinate efforts to preserve water and send it where it is needed most. The governor urged Californians to reduce their water use by 20 percent.
It also reflects the severity of the dry conditions in the nation's most populous state. Officials say 2013 was the state's driest calendar year since records started being kept, and this year is heading in the same direction.
A snow survey on Thursday in the Sierra Nevada, one of the state's key water sources, found that the water content in the meager snowpack is just 12 percent of normal. Reservoirs are lower than they were at the same time in 1977, which is one of the two previous driest water years on record.
It looks like a game of tic tac toe, but engravings found deep inside a cave in Gibraltar might be a Neanderthal masterpiece. At more than 39,000 years old, the etchings rival in age the oldest cave art in Europe — and they are the first to be unquestionably done by a Neanderthal, claim the researchers who discovered them1. Other scientists, however, say that the artwork's attribution is not an open-and-shut case.
Archaeologists uncovered the engravings in Gorham's Cave, a site overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. A team led by zoologist Clive Finlayson, the director of the Gibraltar Museum, has been excavating the cave since the late 1980s. The researchers found that the Neanderthals who called the cave home ate fish, shellfish and birds, and perhaps survived later than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe.
But in July 2012, Finlayson's colleague Francisco Pacheco crawled on the cave floor through a narrow passage to reach the very rear of the chamber, and happened on the etchings, carved on a horizontal platform that is elevated 40 centimetres from the bedrock, like a natural coffee table. “We started to shine the torch in different directions and we started to see the relief of this thing. It's not immediately obvious,” says Finlayson. The drawings cover an area of about 20 by 20 centimetres, roughly the size of a Frisbee, and are up to a few millimetres deep.
Getting a date
Rock art is notoriously tricky to date because it is not immediately linked to human or animal bones that can be carbon-dated. Finlayson, however, is confident that the etching was made by Neanderthals more than 39,000 years ago. A layer of sediment that once covered the engraving contained stone tools typical of those made by Neanderthals dating to between 30,000 and 39,000 years ago. This means that the engraving must be even older, Finlayson says, perhaps 40,000 to 45,000 years old. Humans did not arrive at Gorham's Cave until more than 10,000 years later, and long after Neanderthals were gone.

The team's dating of the Gorham etching makes it one of the oldest examples of cave art in Europe. A smudge of pigment in the Cave of El Castillo in northern Spain dates to more than 40,000 years ago, but it is not clear whether Homo sapiens or Neanderthals created it2.
To better understand the engraving, Finlayson's team tried replicating them using original Neanderthal stone tools. They found that only dozens of purposeful, repeated motions could create similar etchings. “We wanted to show that this was not a doodle, a casual thing,” they say, unlike the helter-skelter scratchings that the authors left when they sliced fresh pork skin on rock, for instance. The team's results appear in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1.
Age-old question
What the signs mean, however, is anyone's guess. “Is it art? I don't know. I can't get into the minds of these people. It looks geometric. It looks like criss-cross patterning,” and perhaps it represents some kind of map, says Finlayson. “What is clear is that it's abstract, it's deliberate, and it speaks to their cognition in a way that brings Neanderthals, once again, closer to us.”
Alistair Pike, an archaeologist at the University of Southampton, UK, says that the engravings, if made by Neanderthals, represent a very important find. “It adds permanent rock engraving to the sparse but significant evidence for Neanderthal symbolic behaviour.” Ochre pigment, shell beads and other adornments have also been used to back the idea that Neanderthals possessed the sorts of symbolic cognitive powers that underlie language and religion (see 'Neanderthal culture: Old masters').
But Harold Dibble, an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, has misgivings about the engraving, as well as the identity of its maker. Sediments tend to shift around a cave, and it is possible that humans made the etchings, only for them to be later covered up by older sediments from prior Neanderthal occupations, they say. Moreover, Dibble questions the importance of abstract scratchings, which also appear on animal bones at Neanderthal sites. “It takes more than a few scratches — deliberate or not — to identify symbolic behaviour on the part of Neanderthals.”

Waka Flocka Flame made a series of transphobic comments on a New York radio station on Friday.
The rapper told ‘The Breakfast Club' that Caitlyn Jenner's transition was an: “Affront to God.”
They went on to accuse “transgenders” of “marketing evil, man.”
Flame continued to wax lyrical about the danger of non-traditional family units, accusing men and women of forgetting their gender roles as “husbands and wives”.
“Women are afraid to be a wife and young males is afraid to be men.” they said.
“It's like, it's not cool, they're not marketing that. They don't market families and husbands and wives no more.
“They're marketing young girls, you know what I'm saying?” they said, as it became increasingly clear that few around them did.
“Transgenders — they're marketing evil, man,” they said, before accusing the trans community of doing the “devil's work” and as a test that society needed to “outbeat [sic]”.
“You are who you are when God made you, not who you became after they did.
“That's how I just feel. You're rebuking God, man.
“God didn't put them feelings in you, man, that's the Devil playing tricks on your mind,” they added.
“That's a test from God. If you can't outbeat [sic] that one task and you believe that, then you're going to believe everything else.”
However, Mr Flame didn't reserve is hate fuelled philosophising for trans people alone – they also criticised the African American community, insisting that they need “get over slavery”.
This is not the first – and we have sneaking suspicion it won't be the last – time that Jenner has faced bigotry from rap musicians.
Hip hop superstar Eminem attacked them recently in a transphobic freestyle rap – during which they called them both “Bruce” and a “bitch”.
In July, the lesser known rapper Lil Scrappy complained about both Jenner and the support they have received since coming out as transgender – claiming their transition was a “racist situation”.
He's obviously never heard of Laverne Cox…
You can watch Waka's problematic interview below.
We have featured a surprising number of Porsche 356s over the years and while we have heard mixed viewpoints of them, one sentiment always seems to make an appearance. That sentiment is that they are usually overpriced. A few we have seen have even left us wondering if the seller just made up a random number to see if someone would actually pay it. Well Mandy T sent us a tip about this 1959 Porsche 356A 1600 Super Cabriolets that was recently listed here on eBay and we think it is proof that some of these sellers really are picking numbers just to throw out there. This one is rare, but after you take a closer look at its condition we think you'll agree that the $99,356 asking price is a tad much.
One look at the floors, or at least the area where the floors are supposed to be, and you will understand why we think this one is overpriced. Early 356s are notorious for having rust issues, but this one takes being rusty to a new level. Interestingly the exterior isn't as rusty as the floors, but it's not far behind. We are still struggling to figure out what is keeping this car together, as there appears to be rust in every structural component and light shining through places that were never meant to see daylight.
The original 1600 boxer four is still with the car, but it is missing a number of parts. It's missing it's pushrods, pistons, and valve covers. Finding most of these pasts should be a simple task, but could get costly. This being a Super means its engine was rated at 88 horsepower, which was an 18 hp increase over the base motor. The missing parts and overall condition really leaves us questioning the seller's sanity. Perhaps there is some information they are leaving out or maybe they want to simply grab people's attention? If this were a Carrera GS than we could understand the price, but this one is going to be so costly to restore that it just doesn't make sense to pay so much for it.
We have no doubt there is a true 356 fans out there who would love to tackle this project, but finding one willing to spend this kind of money is going to be a challenge. The seller seems to be upfront about the condition of the car and even states that they know their car isn't worth the asking price, but that they are looking for serious offers. We aren't sure what they mean by serious offers, but placing $99 in front of 356 probably won't help attract serious buyers. We wish them the best all the same and give them kudos for being bold! Flintstones car anyone?
Russia has deployed a surface-to-surface cruise missile that U.S. officials say violates a Cold War treaty that bans intermediate range nuclear missiles in Europe, CBS News' David Martin has confirmed.
Russia deployed the ground-launched weapon system in December at the tail end of the Obama administration. The Obama administration complained about the December violation, but Russia ignored the complaints and continued to test the missile.
Deployed, the missile is now part of Russia's operational forces.

The treaty in question was signed between President Ronald Reagan and Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev in the final years of the Cold War and is still in effect. It bars missiles with a range greater than 300 miles.
U.S. officials tell CBS News' David Martin that they have monitored flight tests in which the missile, known as the SSC-8, flew farther than 300 miles.
Besides violating the treaty, the deployment increases the military threat to NATO and raises the question of what the U.S. can do in response.
Relations between the U.S. and Russia have taken center stage this week after National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was ousted from their White House post after evidence emerged that they misled administration officials about talks they had with the Russian ambassador before Mr. Trump took office.
According to the Washington Post, the White House was warned weeks ago by the Justice Department that Flynn had misled the White House about those communications and was susceptible to Russian blackmail.
A Russian spy ship is also currently patrolling off the east coast of the United States, but well into international waters.
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
Why does the mainstream media heap such scorn and disbelief on Donald Trump over their promise to build a great wall along the border with Mexico — and make Mexico pay for it? After all, Donald Trump has built a winning presidential campaign — and made the media pay for it.
Mr. Trump's second place finish in Iowa gave respite to the legions of media pundits and establishment flunkies who suffer the worst forms of Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome. They braced for a huge blow-out win in the Corn State. When it didn't happen, it was like an executioner's gun jamming. First they flinched, then they blinked a few times and then got up and ran like their hair was on fire.
Ever since, of course, they have been gloating and crowing — from a safe distance — that Donald Trump failed. King Midas had finally touched something and turned it into silver, instead of gold.
This, to be sure, is every bit as delusional as the derangement syndrome that has captivated their sanity for six months now. What Donald Trump pulled off in Iowa was nothing short of miraculous.
The last time a secular, loud, brash New Yorker who was leading in all the national polls faced Iowa Republican voters — former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani in 2008 — they got truly schlonged. Mr. Giuliani came in sixth place with only 4 percent of the vote.
SEE ALSO: Clinton backlash palpable in New Hampshire as independents lift Sanders
Donald Trump came in second place with an astonishing 24 percent of the vote. They were just 3.3 percentage points behind Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who won the race by shamelessly pandering to the state's huge evangelical population, which has determined the outcome of every Republican caucus there since at least 2000.
If Rudy Giuliani had done as well in Iowa as Trump did, the media would have declared them the winner and they very likely would rush through New Hampshire and South Carolina on waves of positive press and their ultimate gambit of winning it all in Florida very likely could have worked. In other words, if Mr. Giuliani had done as well as Mr. Trump did in Iowa, we quite possibly would be referring to them now as former President Giuliani.
But the media hatred for Mr. Trump is so unrestrained that even a stellar accomplishment like they had in Iowa was dismissed as a shattering loss. And Sen. Marco Rubio's third place loss behind Mr. Trump was spun endlessly as some kind of huge victory. This propelled the Florida Republican, until their poor performance in last weekend's robotic performance in the New Hampshire debate.
What is so amazing about Mr. Trump's blowout in the nation's first primary in the Granite State is not just the 2-to-1 win over the next-nearest competitor, but their performance among every demographic group on every single issue.
Among women, middle-aged voters, the elderly, the educated — all people the experts warned would flee from Donald Trump — Mr. Trump managed to win. And they won on every major issue, including the economy, foreign policy and immigration.
Perhaps the sweetest thing out of New Hampshire is how the media will be forced to spin the results. They will, of course, try to minimize Mr. Trump's thumping.
Then they will be forced to breathe wind into Ohio Gov. John Kasich's disappointing — but surprising — second-place finish. The Kasich campaign is hopeless going forward. And so the battle rages on for the so-called “establishment lane” with Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and even Ted Cruz piled up behind John Kasich's hopeless campaign.
Live by the spin, die by the spin.

Sandra Bullock thanked Jesse James when they accepted their Academy Award three weeks ago, and they cried and smiled proudly, which made them look like a real scumbag in hindsight because it turns out they were banging some dirty whore the whole time.
Wait did I say “whore”? I meant to say “whores”.
Another Jesse James mistress has been discovered and this one has hired power attorney Gloria Allred!
The new mistress had a several year affair with James, they charge, that ended just recently.
And yes, there's proof. Hundreds of text messages, emails and photos.
Allred said: “I represent a beautiful model and business person. They had a three year intimate relationship with Jesse James.
“He pursued them and had strong feeling for them  They are in the process of trying to decide if they will come forward. They have proof of their relationship including hundreds of text messages, emails and photos. The relationship JUST RECENTLY ENDED after the scandal broke.”
Hopefully this new one is a brunette too because most Tigers whores were blond and hair color is starting to be the only way I can remember which whore belonged to whom. I'm sure this new one will be a real treat, just like Bombshell. No wonder Sandra is in hiding. One ugly girl has the fighting power of three pretty girls. It's not like they're worried about scars or anything. So Sandra is now outnumbered 12 to 1. They should probably move to Brazil or something.
A National Journal survey of members of Congress found that 74 percent of Congressional Republicans do not believe that global warming is caused by humans.
The poll asked 39 Democrats and 39 Republicans if they thought that "it's been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Earth is warming because of human-made pollution". The answers are anonymous, except for party affilliation. Only 26 percent of Republicans answered yes, with the rest answering no. Among Democrats, 95 percent answered yes.
The survey's results include some choice anonymous quotes from the deniers:
"Reasonable people have doubts. For every Al Gore, there is an intelligent scientist armed with legitimate facts to debunk him."
"In the '70s, the 'consensus of scientists' was that we were beginning global cooling. Now it is global warming. Excuse me if I am skeptical of this newest form of secular religion. Perhaps we should pause and take a breath before we drink the new Kool-Aid!" [Ed. note: As the scientists at RealClimate demonstrate, there was no such consensus on global cooling in the 1970s.]
"If there's one thing poll after poll indicates, it's that the science is not settled on this issue."
"What has been proven is that a well-targeted pop-culture campaign can trump even the best of science. The bad news is, a very few will get very rich, and the rest of us will foot the bill with mythical creations like cap and trade. The impact of such programs on the environment: Zero. The cost to the American public: Huge. The grin on Al Gore's very wealthy face: Priceless!"
The survey quotes both Democrats who responded no.
"[Evidence is conflicting on whether] warming is human-made, but there shouldn't be any doubt that a human-made solution is needed. The trend won't reverse on its own."
"This global-warming debate is a farce."
Of the ten Republicans who responded yes, the National Journal quotes one of them:
"Put it this way: Is there anyone who reasonably believes that the emissions caused by man have no effect on the environment? It doesn't take a degree in science to accept the concept that the actions of billions of people driving millions of cars do indeed impact the world around us."

During the Champions League final Gary Lineker posted a simple five-word tweet: “Pepe is such a dick!” It did not so much strike a chord as create global symphonic harmony on social media. More than 50,000 retweets and likes later, and following yet more devious behaviour by the Real Madrid defender, Lineker clarified their position. “Pepe is an enormous dick!” That tweet proved to be even more popular. How could it not be, given Pepe's outrageously hammy behaviour?
One scene in particular should earn them a golden raspberry. What appeared to be harmless mano a mano coming together with the Atlético Madrid defender Filipe Luís in the second half ended with Pepe rolling along the turf, howling in apparent agony. It was first-year stage school stuff and the referee Mark Clattenburg was having none of it.
Pepe's great act was not finished there, though. When Filipe placed a palm on their left cheek, they then grabbed their face and thrashed around as if their eyes had been gouged. Clattenburg's disappointed-parent face quickly became an internet meme. But there was no yellow card despite the double simulation. So Pepe carried on being Pepe, kicking and niggling away.
Soon afterwards they were play-acting again, this time after another tangle with the substitute Yannick Carrasco. Again Pepe clutched their face as if an arrow had split their nostrils. Yet still there was no sanction.
It took until extra-time for the Real Madrid central defender to finally be booked. Remarkably this season they have picked up only seven yellow cards in 32 games. Some say they have cleaned up their act. More likely they have just got cleverer at covering it up.
Later, after the trophy had been lifted, Pepe swanned around San Siro with a selfie stick and their tongue poked out in celebration. It was an act almost laser‑targeted to cause annoyance to anyone still watching. But Pepe did not care. Real had won. And so had he.
It is a familiar story. For years Pepe has been a neat symbiosis of Fagin and Bill Sikes, both cunning and with enough muscle to back it up. Famously they received a 10-match ban after raking their studs down the back of the Getafe player Javier Casquero while they were on the floor before treading on their ankle – and then, for good measure, smacking Casquero's team-mate Juan Albín. As they left the field after being shown the red card Pepe shouted, “You're all sons of bitches.”
Their subsequent rap sheet would make Grandmaster Flash blush and they are still usually at the epicentre of at least one el clásico rumpus a season, most famously when they appeared to stamp on Lionel Messi's hand in 2012. But has there ever been a tough guy footballer who has turned out to be a bigger ham than Pepe? At least Vinnie Jones waited until their playing career was over to turn to acting.
Real Madrid win the Champions League against Atlético - in pictures Read more
Yet such has been the outcry since Saturday night there might just be a renewed opportunity to tackle such nefarious behaviour. The current system, of awarding yellow cards for simulation, clearly isn't working. And while the most obvious alternative - retrospective punishments - has its merits, the Champions League final showed up a major flaw. Would Pepe really care if they missed Real's first game of the new season? Of course not.
So what might work better? Start by making the punishment for the cheat match the intended crime. So, if Pepe tries to trick the referee into giving Filipe Luís and Carrasco red cards, then they should receive that punishment. Not yellow. Next, give officials a push and a helping hand.
Of course football often operates in shades of grey – look at the way Fernando Torres won a penalty early in the second half by cleverly getting their body ahead of their marker and earning the foul, which would not have been given by all officials. However Pepe's antics were as black as charcoal. They should have been sent off.
So praise the referees who punish simulation. Push them constantly to do more. And, because we know they need so help when the game rushes past so quickly, give them some back up by allowing the fourth official to alert them when the video evidence so obviously showcases of diving, feigning injury or hidden fouls. After all, there is precedent. I was at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin when Zinedine Zidane butted Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup final. No one knew why the referee had stopped the game; only later was it revealed that someone had alerted them via their earpiece.
Clearly there is a balance to be struck between maintaining the flow of the game and making the right decision. But the threat would be enough. Tell the players that the fourth official might use video evidence and the risk‑v‑reward debate in their heads alters overnight: why pretend to have been punched when in 30 seconds' time you would be receiving red for play-acting?
All this potential rule change needs now is a name. So why not the Pepe Rule – after the man whose behaviour on Saturday should lead to its introduction?
Andrew J. Robinson has written a really terrific book which is unlike any other Trek novel I have ever read: there is no central action or mission to accomplish, and there is very little humor. Instead, this is a psychological study of the character Robinson played on DS9, giving us their background - how they grew up, insights into the hierarchical structure of Cardassian society, glimpses of their work in the Obsidian Order, what got them exiled to a tailor's shop on a Bajoran station, and the reality of their return home and the third stage of their life attempting to rebuild their world. The book moves through time; it does drag in a few places, and it leaves me wanting more in others - I really wanted more of their mission on Romulus. The book is very subtle, so I had to reread sections because the significance of them escaped me on the first reading. It is very well written.
I do have one complaint, however, and it is directed toward the Kindle edition of the book: the quality is terrible! "You will be given a period of time to prove whether you have anything of value to contribute to the, of course, is contingent on ..." That's how it appears in the book. "I'd hesrd about this two days ago..." The Kindle version has dozens of sloppy typos and errors. Whoever did this did it way too fast and carelessly, and someone ought to go through more patiently and clean this garbage up. We are paying enough money for these books, we ought to get at least comparable quality to the print books. I have to deduct at least one star for all the errors - probably a more accurate rating would be 3.5 stars for the Kindle version.

Flood-stricken communities, including those visited by David Cameron in the Somerset Levels and Yalding in Kent, have been left without planned defences following government funding cuts, the Guardian can reveal.
Undelivered defences, totalling many millions of pounds, also include schemes on the stretch of Devon coast at Dawlish where the mainline railway fell into the sea and near the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset.
Ministers have been heavily criticised for cutting flood defence spending by almost £100m a year after taking power, but this is the first time specific projects affected by the cuts have been identified.
In the heart of the Somerset Levels, a £2.2m scheme to improve flood management on the Parrett, the main river draining the Levels, and the nearby Sowy river, was postponed and currently has no prospect of funding before 2020.
In March 2012, an Environment Agency (EA) report on the scheme said: "The [rivers'] combined function is of great importance to the effective management of floodwaters in the area."

Another scheme for the Parrett, near the village of Burrowbridge, was in line for £300,000 of funding from 2011-13 but has received nothing. The Parrett overtopped its banks by Burrowbridge in January and the village was cut off.
A third scheme for the river, called "Parrett Estuary – Cannington Bends", worth £6.2m, covered an area near where it meets the sea, just a few miles from the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point.
The defences, which were to be part-funded by Hinkley-owner EDF Energy, would have moved 536 homes out of "the very significant or significant flood probability category to the moderate or low category", according to EA documents. In 2010, the agency said the defences "urgently need updating" and the Cannington Bends area was heavily flooded in 2012, but the scheme has received no funding under the coalition and is currently in line for only £792,000 in 2016-17.
The missing schemes were identified by the Guardian by comparing the flood defence spending plans for 2010-11, the final year of the last government's budget and a high-water mark for flood defence spending, with the plans for subsequent years under the coalition.

In an interview with the Guardian the under-fire chairperson of the Environment Agency, Chris Smith, welcomes the prime minister's recent "money is no object" remark to cope with the fallout of the storms, but wonders whether it will apply beyond the immediate crisis.
"I hope they will apply the same principle to the longer-term issues about improving our flood defences. One of the things that has worried me is whether flood defence is seen by the Treasury as a high enough priority," they say.
Lord Smith says there would have to be an annual £20m rise in the government's £600m flood defence budget, as well as any inflationary increase, just to maintain Britain's present level of protection.
Chris Huhne, the former energy and climate change secretary, claims in a Guardian article that the chancellor, George Osborne, was the driving force behind the cuts in flood defence spending in 2010. The chancellor was then forced to increase flood defence spending last June because insurance companies were threatening to withdraw cover for 350,000 homes at risk, Huhne claims.

Other undelivered flood defence schemes now identified include a project in Devon called the Dawlish Warren and Exmouth Beach Management Scheme, the goal of which was "to reduce tidal flood risk to nearly 3,000 properties and the main railway into the south-west". It had been in line for £2.7m, but by March 2015 will have received only a third of that.
The village of Yalding in Kent began flooding on Christmas Eve, with people evacuated by boat and helicopter, and Cameron was heckled by angry locals during a visit a few days later. It had been in line for £200,000 of flood protection funding between 2011 and 2013, but has received nothing and there is no current plan for spending in the area.
It has also been established that about £5m is being spent between 2011 and 2015 on the Levels to improve the condition of seven sites of special scientific interest where otters, birds and important plants live, as well as to provide more storage for floodwaters. In total, about 1,500 hectares of water-dependent habitat are being improved, thereby avoiding heavy fines under EU environmental directives.
Flood defence funding rose sharply under the last government, following the recommendations of the Pitt review into the catastrophic floods of 2007. Under the coalition, annual spending fell to at least £90m below 2010-11 levels until 2013-14. In July 2012, the Guardian identified 294 flood defence schemes across the whole of England that had been in line for funding but had not gone ahead.
A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which provides the funding for flood defences, said: "We have spent £2.4bn on flood management and protection from coastal erosion over the past four years. We will continue to build defences where they are needed."
Lord Smith says: "The agency works within clear government guidelines on where to spend the funding it is given to maximise the protection for people and property."
Lord Krebs, the government's lead independent adviser on adapting to the impacts of climate change, said: "Ministers are perfectly entitled to say 'look we just don't have enough money and we will have to accept a greater risk of flooding.' That is a political judgment which needs to be made."
But they said cutting flood defence spending was a false economy, as each scheme saved £8 in damage for every £1 spent: "In the long term these measures pay for themselves."
Krebs warned that without a change of approach to improve flood protection in line with the rising risk from climate change, the current "firefighting" approach to the crisis would be the only one available. "Up to now climate measures have been seen as a long-term issue and it is always difficult for governments to think about long-term issues," they said. "But sometimes it takes a crisis like this to wake people up. Let's deal with the short-term emergency, but I would be very sad if this was all put back in the filing cabinet afterwards."
In their interview, Smith accepts that the EA's response to the flooding has not been perfect. They say it should have pushed harder for the money to dredge the rivers on the Somerset Levels, and they should have visited the county earlier to show support. "There was a whole rest of country to worry about. I was up on the Humber looking at the damage from the storm surge and elsewhere. But I probably should have gone to talk with people down there at an earlier stage."
Smith says more than 5 million people in Britain are at risk of flooding, and that the government has to recognise the dangers. "Flooding knocks out businesses, it knocks out employment, it costs a huge amount to restore. This is something quite apart from the human distress. Government has to give flood defence a higher priority."
Small and medium-sized firms that have been flooded or suffered significant loss of trade will be able to apply for help from the new Business Support Scheme announced by the prime minister. A helpline is also being set up to provide advice.
Cameron said: "The government is taking action across the board to deal with the clear-up and help hard-working people affected by the floods. Dealing with these floods will be a long haul, requiring a stepped-up national effort with the whole country pulling together. We will continue to help the people who need help and protect the communities that need protecting."
The business secretary, Vince Cable, said: "It is vital that small businesses affected by the flooding get assistance as quickly as possible. We know the insurance companies are working to process claims as quickly as possible and we will inform local authorities of their allocations from the Business Support Scheme on Thursday to assist businesses with clean-up costs or help them to continue trading."
Large swaths of Britain remain on high alert, with severe flood warnings still in place along the Thames and in Somerset.
Forecasters predicted some respite this week as largely fine weather with lighter winds and less rain is expected for the next five days.
Health officials in two Bay Area counties are putting out an advisory, letting thousands of people know that they may have been exposed to the measles virus. The biggest concern is to those who ride BART between the Lafayette and Montgomery Street stations.It was exactly one year ago that a UC Berkeley student rode BART several times in one week and later found out they or they had measles. In that case, no one got the disease. Health officials hope the same thing happens this time.It's BART's busiest line during commute hours -- the trip between Bay Point and San Francisco serves 25,000 people during the morning alone.And now, according to health officials in Contra Costa County, a person with an active case of measles was in those crowded cars on six occasions last week."We determined that this individual traveled on BART during the infectious period," said Erika Jenssen with Contra Costa Public Health.The infected person boarded BART trains in Lafayette last week, three days in a row, during the morning and evening commutes. They or they exited at the Montgomery Street station in San Francisco and went to work at LinkedIn's offices on 2nd St.Hani Durzy, director of LinkedIn's corporate communications, issued a statement on Wednesday: "On Tuesday, Feb. 10, we were informed that an employee based in our San Francisco office was diagnosed with measles. We are working very closely with the San Francisco Department of Public Health, and following their recommended protocol for managing this situation. The health and well-being of our employees is our absolute top priority, and we will take whatever steps are advised to ensure their safety and the safety of the general public.""The people who are the most vulnerable are the ones that we are most concerned about," said San Francisco Health Officer Tomas Aragon, MD. "So we're concerned about pregnant women, infants, people who are immune compromised, people who either can't get vaccinated, or if they get measles could have a complicated course."Health officials have released the following timeline for the BART travel -- the individual was on BART between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. from Feb. 4 through Feb. 6. and then returned from San Francisco to Lafayette each of those evenings from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m."That line is our busiest line and what's called the shoulders of the commute, right after 9 a.m., those trains are distributed elsewhere in the system," said BART spokesperson Alicia Trost. "So there is a possibility that even if you rode, say the Richmond line, that you may have been on the exact same train this person was on."The infected person also spent some time at the E&O Kitchen and Bar on San Francisco's Sutter Street last Wednesday between 5:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. Health officials say the measles patient is recovering at home and will remain isolated for 21 days.The state health department is now reporting 110 measles cases in California, and only about a third of them are the result of the Disneyland outbreak.Including the one now reported in Contra Costa County, there have been 15 cases in the Bay Area. Six in Alameda County, three in San Mateo County, two each in Marin and Santa Clara counties, and one in Solano County.The first symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, and sore throat. You might also feel very tired. Then you'll get spots in your mouth followed by a rash all over. It usually takes 7 to 18 days for the symptoms to appear once you've been exposed.

Well what did you expect? North Korea's flag carrier airline Air Koryo isn't all that amazing.
It's been ranked by leading aviation review and ranking site Skytrax as the world's worst airline for years – the only one-star carrier out of all 681 assessed annually simply because they don't have a no star category.
But the world's most secretive and isolated nation is about to upgrade its flying status (in fairness, the super posh Middle East carriers probably don't need to worry too much about this) from the current timewarp experience of ancient planes with little in-flight entertainment, memorable (in a bad way) food, and minimal customer service.
The world's worst airline's 'burger meal' went viral just a few years ago
North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-un has authorised an air revolution for Air Koryo, with new (ish) aircraft, the arrival of in-flight entertainment (it's probably best to manage your expectations here), new cabin crew uniforms and even that fancy dan business class so loved by those evil capitalist westerners.
Media gurus Bloomberg News have investigated state-owned Air Koryo - which has had one fatal crash, in 1983 - and come up with five perfectly valid (or completely insane, depending on your point of view) reasons to book your Air Koryo ticket now, before the 'thrill' of flying the world's only one star airline vanishes forever.
1) You get to see North Korea (obviously)
Besides the 'joy' of experiencing Air Koryo, you get a peek inside the reclusive dictatorship. Singapore passenger Mindy (say hello to Mork for us) Tan visited last year and told Bloomberg: "I'm sick of all the same footage of marching, pictures of Kim. I just had to witness it for myself.''
Around 5,000 tourists visit the totalitarian country annually , undeterred by having little or no mobile or internet access, the constant presence of a government-appointed tour guide and having to hang around your hotel at night because there's nothing much else to do, unless you can track down a local bar.
Still, there's always the chance of the odd nuclear test or missile launch to liven up the day and Pyongyang's annual marathon is popular.

2) Unique in-flight entertainment
The screens that drop down from the ceiling of the plane will offer a range of propaganda broadcasts and music from Kim Jong-un's favourite all-female band Moranbong , who sing patriotic songs about... Kim Jong-un. You can't turn the sound off. Enjoy.
(Image: Barcroft)
3) The planes (we are not talking Dreamliners here)
Air Koryo recently acquired two Russian-built 1990s-era Tupolev Tu-204s for international routes, with an economy ticket costing about 900 yuan ($137) for the two-hour journey from Beijing.
The rest of the fleet is not quite so modern. You could fly on a 1960s Ilyushin Il-62 or head back to the late 1950s for a spin on an Antonov An-24 - both planes made in the heyday of the USSR .
In 2006 the EU banned Air Koryo from its airspace on safety grounds, but now allows the Tu-204s to fly in.
Aviation enthusiast Sam Chui, who's flown Air Koryo about 20 times, said: "It's a very different experience... travelling back 20, 30 years.''

4) Skip those airport queues
Arrival at the Democratic People's Republic should be a breeze. No longer do you have to shuffle through the shed that has been masquerading as an airport terminal for the past five years, now Pyongyang Sunan International Airport has a sleek, new building.
And with only around half a dozen international flights a day and none of the workers going on strike any time soon (those labour camps aren't a barrel of laughs), you'll pretty much have the place to yourself.

5) The airline food
The most-photographed part of any Air Koryo flight is the famous "mystery meat" burger .
"The burger has been going on for so many years, everyone's making fun of it," says Sam Chui, who has eaten at least 10 of them and is still alive to tell the tale.
Bloomberg asked Air Koryo's office in Beijing what the mystery meat is in the burger and is still waiting for a response. It's possibly not ground fillet steak. Close your eyes, chew...and pray. Passengers who've reviewed the flights on Skytrax did at least say the beer on board wasn't bad!

How to get there...
London-based Juche Travel Services offers an aviation-themed tour from May 9 to 13.
Simply meet at the Chonji restaurant in Beijing for your pre-tour meeting where you'll get travel documents, a briefing and dinner and a chance to meet your fellow travellers.
Your accommodation in Pyongyang is the four star (that's the North Korea idea of four stars, not the west's) Koryo Hotel, which does at least have a microbrewery bar.
The tour costs €1,220 with accommodation in shared twin rooms. Flights to Beijing are not included.
And good luck with that burger...
While many Tisdale residents take pride in town's abundant rapeseed crop, officials wonder if motto could be interpreted as ‘insensitive'
Many residents of tiny Tisdale, an island-like hamlet of 3,200 on the Saskatchewan prairie, are proud to call their town the rape capital of Canada.
Since 1960, Tisdale's rare visitors have encountered welcome signs promoting the village as the Land of Rape and Honey – and many locals want to keep it that way, according to town official Sean Wallace.
“From what I understand a lot of people feel there's a tradition involved in that,” Wallace said. “That's something I can't fault.”
All the same, decades of complaints and growing embarrassment recently inspired the town to launch a survey of its citizens to see if they would prefer to “update” the slogan, which uses the traditional name of rapeseed, a mustard-like plant that blankets the treeless fields for hundreds of kilometres in every direction from Tisdale.
“Is it time for a change?” the survey asks, delicately hinting at the problem with the use of capital letters: the Land of RAPE and Honey.
The tradition began when crop scientists in neighbouring Manitoba developed an edible variety of rapeseed (from the Latin rapum for turnip), which had been previously used solely to produce industrial oils. Now grown widely around the world for use as a cooking oil, rapeseed was renamed “canola” (for Canadian oil, low acid) early in its existence for obvious marketing reasons.
But not in Tisdale – at least until July, when the results of the survey will be known.
Residents are “quite passionate” about the issue, according to Wallace, but not because they consider the slogan insensitive.
“There are some residents who feel I should be educating people about what rapeseed is, and there's some people who feel I should look at rebranding because it's no longer called rapeseed any more,” they said. “It's called canola.”
Among other questions, the survey asks potential Tisdale entrepreneurs whether or not they would like to “promote the current town brand Land of Rape and Honey on your marketing materials”.
At least one local businessperson interviewed about the issue by the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix thinks tradition here might run a little too deep. “I'd like to see it change,” Heather Mievre, owner of Valle Mens Wear, told the paper. “You gotta have some change once in a while.”

The Department of Defense is preparing to dispatch 615 more U.S. troops to Iraq to help government forces oust ISIS from the city of Mosul, the White House announced Wednesday.
The soldiers will provide logistics support for the Iraqi forces and not spearhead the attack, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday. The troops, who will deploy in the coming weeks, will have a supporting role, helping with logistics and providing advice.

"These are military forces that will be deployed to intensify the strategy that's in place, to support Iraqi forces as they prepare for an offensive against...Mosul," Earnest said.
"American President Barack Obama was consulted on a request from the Iraqi government for a final increase in the number of trainers and advisers under the umbrella of the international coalition in Iraq," the Iraqi leader said in a statement Wednesday obtained by Reuters.
Currently there are 4,647 U.S. soldiers in Iraq.
In April, more than 200 troops, including additional special operations forces, were sent to Iraq to train and advise government forces readying for the Mosul assault.
The Iraqis also got Apache attack helicopters and a HIMARS rocket system. Another $415 million was sent to the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.
In April, Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced the U.S. would deploy an additional 560 troops to Iraq over the course of several weeks. Those troops would offer infrastructure and logistical support at Qayara airfield south of Mosul, Carter said at the time.
"The Iraqis are still in the lead. That doesn't change," Carter told Nightly News anchor Lester Holt. "Americans are at risk today every single day here. As secretary of defense, I take that more seriously than anything else. I want our troops to be effective, but I want them also to be as safe as possible consistent with that."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said on Wednesday that despite recent strong U.S. economic growth they still feel the Fed should not raise interest rates until likely the second half of next year.
Speaking on CNBC, Lockhart said strong second-quarter gross domestic product growth was partly a rebound from the dismal start of the year and may not be sustained. More evidence is needed, Lockhart said, before they are convinced the economy is ready to absorb higher rates without a risk to the recovery.
“It is a little early to conclude that the economy is going to grow that fast in the third quarter,” said Lockhart, who does not currently have a vote on the Fed's main policymaking committee. “Sometime mid-year, next year, onward is likely to be the right time ... I am still looking for an accumulation of validating data.”
They said their focus was on growth and ensuring the recovery is maintained.
“I am just simply looking for more evidence that we are on the track that we think we are on ... and it is going to take a while to be sure of that,” they said. There was little risk, they said, of a “breakout of inflation to the high side ... That is simply a low probability.”
The debate at the Fed over a future rate hike has been intensifying, with one dissent at the U.S. central bank's latest rate-setting meeting and some policymakers becoming more vocal about the possible need to raise rates sooner as the economy strengthens.
Lockhart is considered a centrist in that debate and said in the interview that they were “slower on the trigger” than members like Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher who feel the Fed needs to act sooner.
The Pew Research Center recently issued an impressively detailed analysis of the local news ecosystems in three U.S. communities of different sizes and demographic characteristics (Denver, Colorado; Macon, Georgia; and Sioux City, Iowa). This research is the latest, and perhaps most sophisticated, effort to try to improve our understanding of the changing dynamics surrounding the production, dissemination, and consumption of news at the local level.
The report contains a number of interesting findings, detailing important differences in how journalism is produced and distributed across different types of communities. Not surprisingly, these communities differ dramatically in terms of the number of news sources available (ranging from almost 150 in Denver to 24 in Macon). The three communities also differ substantially in terms of the extent to which digital news sources have gained a foothold; as well as in terms of the availability of news sources targeting minority communities.
In New Jersey, we are working on some related research, as part of the News Measures Research Project supported by the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation and the Democracy Fund. We have been examining three local New Jersey communities of different sizes and demographic characteristics (Newark, New Brunswick, and Morristown) in an effort to develop useful indicators of the “health” of local journalism ecosystems.
Some of the findings in the Pew study jumped out as particularly relevant to the particular context of New Jersey. For instance, the Pew study reports that, regardless of how the web and social media have become an increasingly integral part of local news ecosystems, it's still local television news that residents rely upon the most. As the authors of the study note: “Local TV, with multiple channels and news programs throughout the day, has the broadest reach in each city,” one that far exceeds all other new sources. In fact, in each of the three communities studied, local TV news is relied upon by nearly twice as many residents as the second most important news source (daily newspapers in the case of Denver and Sioux City, other local residents in the case of Macon).
Why is this finding particularly important for New Jersey? Because, for a state of nearly nine million residents, New Jersey barely has any local television stations. Most of the local television stations that New Jersey residents receive — particularly those that produce news — originate from across the border in either New York City or Philadelphia. The only city in New Jersey that has a small cluster of local TV stations to call its own is Atlantic City. For the rest of New Jersey, local TV news means news originating from New York or Philadelphia, or from a statewide cable news network such as News 12 New Jersey. And while these sources do provide some coverage of New Jersey, the bottom line is that for stations located outside of the state, any coverage of New Jersey will be dictated at least in part by whether the stories are also of interest to residents of New York or Philadelphia.
It would be interesting to see if a survey of New Jersey residents indicates levels of reliance on local TV for news that are as high as those found in the surveys of the three communities conducted by Pew. One would hope not, for to rely on local TV news in New Jersey is to rely on news that, for the most part, isn't really local at all. But odds are that we would find similar levels of reliance on “local” television for news in New Jersey. Research tells us that that all forms of media content — including news — tend to flow from large markets to small markets and that the bigger-budget content produced in larger markets can divert audiences' attention from the smaller-budget content produced within and for their local communities.
The effect of that diversion of audience attention to non-local sources is damaging both economically and politically. Economically because true local news sources have to share audience attention — and thus advertising dollars — with larger, out-of-market news sources, making it more difficult for them to remain viable. And politically because these kinds of shortfalls in the provision and consumption of local news can undermine informed political participation and community engagement.
Given these dynamics, perhaps it is not surprising that in our ongoing research on the health of local news ecosystems in those three New Jersey communities, Newark — a relatively large city with over a quarter of a million residents, located just across the river from New York City — appears to be dramatically underserved by local news sources when compared to the other two communities, both of which are further outside the orbit of New York. Specifically, when we examined the number of sources of local journalism in each of the three communities, Morristown had 11 times more local journalism sources per 10,000 residents than Newark; New Brunswick had almost four times more sources per 10,000 residents than Newark.
The situation gets more extreme when we look at the outputs of these journalism sources. For instance, in a sampled week, Morristown received 23 times more news stories per 10,000 residents than Newark, and New Brunswick received 9.3 times more news stories per 10,000 residents than Newark. We found similar patterns when we focused on the social media outputs (specifically, Facebook and Twitter) for these journalism sources. In our sampled week, Morristown journalism sources produced 20 times more social media posts per 10,000 residents than Newark sources, while New Brunswick journalism sources produced six times more social media posts per 10,000 residents than Newark sources. These patterns persisted — and in some cases became more pronounced — when we focused our analysis on stories/posts that were original, that were about the local community, and that addressed “critical information needs.”
There may be a range of other possible explanations for these patterns that extend beyond the issue of proximity to a large, out-of-state media market. Indeed, the variety of pronounced differences found between the three communities studied in the Pew report, and the pronounced differences found between the three New Jersey communities studied in our research, point to the fact that local journalism ecosystems may be impacted by a range of factors. To truly understand the complex relationships between the characteristics of local communities and the characteristics of local journalism ecosystems, we need to figure out a way to expand beyond the kinds of focused analyses on a limited number of communities that we have been conducting thus far. By figuring out a way to scale this kind of research so that we can analyze 100, or even 200, communities, we can gain a broader, more generalizable sense of what makes for healthy — and unhealthy — local journalism ecosystems in this country, and what this health — or lack thereof — means for how well these communities function.
We'll be talking about these and related issues at our April 10 conference, Quality Journalism in the Digital Age. We welcome everyone to come to Rutgers and join the conversation.

Did you know that being a Washington resident means extra discounts at many Whistler hotels? The resort town was an international draw even before the 2010 Olympics, and soon it'll launch its annual Cornucopia food festival (November 7–17). But we Washingtonians are still VIPs, especially in the early days of the ski season. As the ski season launches, look for these discounts:
• The Whistler Blackcomb ski mountains themselves discount Edge cards—fancy RFID lift tickets, basically—for Washington residents, who pay $70–$89 per day to get on lifts rather than the standard $119. Additional perks include discounts on shopping, rentals, and lessons.
• Nita Lake Lodge has a VIP package for locals that offers free parking, free late checkout, and spa discounts.
• The Fairmont Chateau Whistler offers 15 percent off their best price of the day to Washington folk, plus free Internet service, ski valet, and yoga classes. Plus you get to stay in the most castlelike of Whistler's big hotels.
• The Pan Pacific Whistler Mountainside gives Washington residents free Wi-Fi, free ski valet, and free self-parking, but only through November 27.
• The Four Seasons Whistler special is much like the others: 15 percent off the room, free valet parking, free Internet, and free fitness classes.
Of course, since most offers can't be combined with others—ski and stay packages, free-night packages, and the like—you might be better off forgoing your Washington discount. Whistler rates generally go up across the board after November 15.
Orthoprint, or How I Open-Sourced My Face 10 Mar 2016 | self-Amos, making, orthodontics, laser-scanning, prototyping, somatic feedback
[Warning: Do not attempt anything written here; I assume no liability for any actions you take to modify your body.]
The concept:
What if you had a chance to save money, make yourself happier, and stick it to the dental appliance industry, all in one shot?
Scientific American says that by conciously smiling, we trigger a psychological feedback mechanism that causes us to be happy. I had an amazing realization last year- I wasn't smiling, and it was because I was unhappy with my teeth. They weren't awful, but they were crooked enough to make me self conscious. It's very hard to smile when doing so makes you self concious about your teeth- every single time. By avoiding smiling, I was dampening my own potential for spontaneous happiness!
I took a mold of my teeth with some cheap alginate powder, Permastone, and a 3d printed impression tray, to get a better picture of what was really going on. Notice LI-r (right lateral incisor) projected outward, and CI-r (right central incisor) depressed inward and overlapping.
At the time of writing this, I'm an undergrad, which means that a) I'm broke, and b) I have access to expensive digital fabrication tools - definitely an unusual dichotomy. I was researching [name brand clear-aligner treatment], and I ran across a photo that caught my eye:
Those look like the layer striations from a 3D print!
What is to stop someone, who has access to a 3D printer, from making their own orthodontic aligners?
Turns out, not much! Except for an instict for self-preservation (If you want to lose your lunch, search Google to see how amateur wire braces can go horribly wrong).
More research led me to the professional process for clear orthodontic alignment:
The dentist assesses your teeth for suitability for the procedure. Old-school bracket braces can move your teeth in basically any direction or rotation, but plastic aligners can only exert tipping / rotational forces on the teeth. When you put pressure on the crown of a tooth, the crown moves in that direction, and the root moves in the opposite direction (this is known as Begg's tipping principle). Without being bonded to the tooth, plastic aligners also can't do extrusion (pulling the tooth down and away from the maxillary arch).
The teeth are 3D scanned. This used to be done by taking an impression, making a mold/casting, and then sending the cast to be accurately scanned. Now, there's in-office tools like iTero that scan the teeth from within the mouth.
The 3D model (usually an STL file) is taken into some proprietary orthodontic software, where the teeth are separated into separate objects. A technician plans out a route for the teeth to travel over the course of the procedure, so that they move but dont intersect one another.
A series of models is created from the planned route, each representing a step in the motion.
These models are 3D printed with high accuracy.
Thermoplastic aligner material is vacuum formed over the 3D printed models.
The plastic is manually trimmed away and the edges are smoothed, to create a non-irritating aligner.
So what does one need to do this themselves? Knowledge of orthodontic movement, a 3D scanner, a mold of the teeth, CAD software, a hi-res 3D printer, retainer material, and a vacuum forming machine. I realized, I had - or could acquire - all of these things. I have my own 3D printer, but the dimensional accuracy isn't good enough. NJIT has a digital fabrication lab with a Stratasys Dimension 1200es. That would do the trick. I tested the machine, and found it could give me X,Y accuracy under .1mm, which was close enough. I think a stereolithography printer like a Formlabs Form 2 would have been even better, since they have vast X,Y resolution and accuracy. Vertical print resolution didn't matter much- the direction of motion was in X and Y, not Z. The same lab also has a vacuum forming machine, and some NextEngine laser scanners.
I sourced some inert retainer plastic from Ebay (Keystone Pro-Form .030”). These have to sit in the mouth without breaking down or releasing toxic chemicals, so the quality of the plastic is important.
Introducing Orthoprint
My two main reference texts here were Contemporary Orthodontics (5e) by William Proffit DDS, PhD, and Orthodontics at a Glance by Gill Daljit. I don't claim to be an orthodontist, but I needed to be aware of the risks and guidelines.
I'll take you on a journey through the process:
The alginate molds. These molds are very precise, and capture an amazing amount of detail. There were some bubbles in the mold, but it didn't matter- bubbles would result in protrusions in the casting, which could be easily removed, and wouldn't affect the vacuum formed aligner.
The method for making the casting was very simple- I put the mold upside down in a yogurt container, and then filled it with liquid Permastone. When it came out, I simply broke off the top to reveal the casting, and used a razor blade to smooth out the surrounding area. I added two small colored dots to the surface of the casting, which would serve as reference points for scaling the laser scan.
Laser scanning with the NextEngine machine was reasonably painless (although the software interface is awful), and the dimensions of the scan seemed to correspond very closely to the dimensions I measured on the physical model with calipers. However, I had no idea how faithful the actual contours of scan were. The Permastone mold is an ideal material for laser scanning because of the totally matte surface. Creating the animation was also fairly trivial- I separated the visible crowns of the teeth from the gumline, and then made a manifold model from each of the shells. I didn't bother adjusting the geometry of the gums- they are soft. Then it was just a matter of animating them into their correct positions. I measured the total distance of travel, and divided it by the maximum recommended distance a tooth can travel per aligner. Each frame of animation was baked into a new STL model.
Here's where it started to get very exciting. The aligner steps have been printed, in addition to a “riser” that I added in order to make sure the vacuum forming plastic (sourced from ebay) would not cause draping artifacts near the teeth, while cutting down on the time needed to print each one. Vertical print height adds much more time than the other two dimensions. Labeling the pieces is critical, they look virtually identical.
Here's the printed vacuform buck on its riser (the riser was printed on my printer, so it's a different color). I had to jury-rig an adapter for the Formech so that it could grip the small square pieces of retainer material, the bed was too large. This was made out of two pieces of sheet metal with foam tape for seal. The foam tape wasn't very heat resistant, and needed to be replaced every few times it was used.
Here it is close-up. The riser had the wonderful, unintended side effect of creating a perfect line, that I could trace with an x-acto to easily and consistently cut the 3D print from the unfinished vacuum formed aligner.
After they came out of the vacuum form machine, I used my Dremel with a sanding drum to smooth out the edges, so they wouldn't irritate my gums.
Finally, here's the two pictures you're probably most interested in. Before (wearing the first aligner):
After:
Quite a bit better, I think!
Conclusion
As far as I know, I'm the first person to have tried DIY-ing plastic aligners. They're much more comfortable than braces, and fit my teeth quite well. I was pleased to find, when I put the first one on, that it only seemed to put any noticeable pressure on the teeth that I planned to move- a success! I've been wearing them all day and all night for 16 weeks, only taking them out to eat. I'm planning on fabricating a bunch of retainers for the current position, which I can use - till I die - at night. They also happen to work very well as perfectly fitting whitening trays, when trimmed down a tiny bit. They're also fantastic night guards- they've been protecting my teeth from nighttime grinding, without being bulky.
And, most importantly, I feel like I can freely smile again. That's what's most important.
Thanks for looking!

In the Name of Allaah, the Most Gracious, the Ever Merciful…
What exactly are we asking for when we say:
اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ
“Guide us upon the straight path”
Guidance meaning: Lead or direct us to the straight path of Islaam is not the intended meaning in Soorah al-Faatihah, since the people reciting Soorah al-Faatihah have already been guided to it, and they have already accepted it. So are we asking Allaah to:
a) Direct us towards Islaam?
b) Allow us to accept it (Islaam)?
c) Or keep us firm upon it after having accepted it (Hidaayat ath-thabaat ‘alal-Haqq)?
While all three above meanings can be correct, meaning:
1) Guide us to the Straight Path (Islaam), by giving us knowledge of the Religion (by teaching us, through the scholars, for example).
2) Guide us to the Straight Path, by allowing us to accept the new things we learn from our Deen and implement them, as all correct beliefs and acts of worship are from as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem.
3) Guide us to the Straight Path, by granting us stability upon it, after having accepted it (and all its teachings), since not everyone who accepts the truth stays on it! In the authentic Hadeeth of As-Saadiq al-Masdooq (what means): “…A man can be behaving like the people of the Paradise until they are within a hand-span of it, yet what is written for them overtakes him, so they begin behaving like the people of the Hellfire, and thus (dies and) enters it.”
This third understanding is very strong in light of the context of the Verse, in light of what comes after it, mention of those whom Allaah's Anger is upon (the Jews) and those who went astray (after knowledge, the Christians). So we are asking Allaah for the stability upon the truth that neither of the mentioned groups attained!
No one goes to Paradise for accepting Islaam and living for many years upon Islaam, yet dying on disbelief. Paradise is for those who accept Islaam, remain steadfast upon it, and die as Muslims. None of us know how we will die. Thus it is very scary – today we are Muslims worshiping Allaah alone, wal-Hamdulillaah, but what kind of trials will tomorrow bring?!
Fitnah will come and people will go to bed Muslims and go out in the morning as disbelievers! People will go out in the morning as Muslims and be disbelievers by nightfall!! None of us are safe from these trials!
In fact, the people who feel safe and do not think they can stray after being guided are often led astray in the most hideous of ways, since they let their guard down.
All of this is part of worshiping Allaah with fear.
This fear used to leave many of the righteous Salaf crying after reading the Hadeeth mentioned above, they used to say, “Where will our souls go?!”
So, with this is mind, it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT for us to reflect over the meanings of this simple Du'aa that we say so many times, its importance, and how we may have been neglecting the significance of it in our prayers.
May Allaah grant us all steadfastness upon Their magnificent Religion! اهدنا الصراط المستقيم

Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.
Hillel, the Jewish campus organization, released its annual fall college guide earlier this month — complete with rankings of “The Top Schools Jews Choose.” The figures are estimated by campus Hillels. Here are seven takeaways.
1. University of Florida has the most Jewish students of any North American college
University of Florida, with its 6,500 Jewish (out of 33,720 total) undergraduates, edged out out other heavily Jewish public colleges, like University of Maryland and University of Michigan (both with 6,000 plus Jewish undergrads). Two of the top three and four of the top 20 public colleges are in Florida. The private college with the most Jews is New York University, with 6,000 (out of 24,985 total).
2. Barnard is the most-Jewish college that it not officially Jewish
Barnard College in New York, a women's liberal arts college affiliated with Columbia University, has a higher percentage of Jewish students than all but four colleges: Yeshiva University, Jewish Theological Seminary, American Jewish University and Brandeis University — all of which have Jewish missions. The first three colleges are 100 percent Jewish; Brandeis is about half Jewish.
Thirty-three percent of Barnard's undergrads are Jewish (800 out of 2,400 undergrads) — more than the 31 percent at runners-up Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania (750 out of 2,440 undergrads), and Goucher College in Townson, Maryland (450 out of 1,471 undergrads).Yale University's undergrad student body is 27 percent Jewish (1,500 Jewish undergrads out of 5,477 total). Percentage-wise, it narrowly beats out its Ivy League rival Harvard University, which is 25 percent Jewish (1,675 out of 6,694 undergrads). But Cornell University and Columbia University both have more Jews in total — 3,000 and 1,800, respectively.Six of the top 10 most-Jewish public colleges are part of the Big Ten Conference, the oldest athletic conference in the United States, with schools spanning the Midwest and East Coast. Those six colleges, in descending rank by number of Jewish students, are: Rutgers University-New Brunswick (6,400), University of Maryland, College Park (5,800), University of Michigan (4,500), Indiana University (4,200), University of Wisconsin, Madison (4,200) and Pennsylvania State University, College Park (4,000). The other Big Ten schools among the top 50 are Michigan State University (3,500), the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (3,000) and Ohio State University (2,500).That honor goes to McMaster University, a school in Ontario with the official motto “All things cohere in Christ.” McMaster boasts 3,500 Jewish undergrads; University of Western Ontario and York University each have 3,000. McGill University ranks fourth among Canadian schools, with 2,500 Jews.The five inland outliers are: Tulane University in New Orleans (2,250 Jews or 27 percent of its total), Washington University in St. Louis (1,750 Jews or 24 percent of its total), Kenyon College in Ohio (275 Jews or 17 percent of its total), the University of Chicago (800 Jews or 14 percent of its total) and Earlham College in Indiana (130 Jews or 11 percent of its total). None of the colleges in the top 60 are public.University of Michigan offers the third-most Jewish college courses in the country, behind only Yeshiva University (138 courses) and Jewish Theological Seminary of America (150) — which both have 100 percent Jewish student bodies. McGill University and Ohio State University are tied for fourth, with 100 Jewish courses each.

If you are granted usage of the objects in question, make sure the original creators are duly credited for them. However, if you are prepared to add Tamriel_Data.esm as dependency to your mod and use PT_Data.bsa as-is for your project, there will be no need to ask for permission. Only make sure not to re-upload our data files to your own modpage, but ask downloaders to get Tamriel_Data from our own download mirrors. If you do all of this, there will be no need to credit us separately. --Usage of Assets in TR_Data.bsa-- The following resources should only be used in mods with a dependency on Tamriel_data (please do not distribute the resources): - Molecrab - Riverstrider - Telvanni Cephalopod All other resources can be used and redistributed without needing a dependency on Tamriel_Data, provided the TR team is duly credited for the resources used. Feel free to make mods of any description dependant upon the Tamriel Rebuilt mods. We welcome any such work that you may desire to work on.

Tamriel_Data for modders
The road ahead
Tamriel_Data is first and foremost an. It contains meshes, textures, books, and region data that can be used by other mods.It originated from the works of the biggest Morrowind province mods, Project Tamriel and Tamriel Rebuilt and contains not only their assets, but a unified, logical file structure, making their assets easily accessible not only for their modders, but for other projects too.Additionally, Tamriel_Data supplies both vanilla-style resources (Tamriel Rebuilt standard) and a high-resolution alternative (Project Tamriel standard), making sure the assets do not look out of place even if graphical replacers that only cover vanilla Morrowind assets are used.: While the assets for Project Tamriel are all available in both high and resolution, Tamriel Rebuilt is not nearly done. Any texture artists willing to help are welcome! Please PM this account!Tamriel_Data.esm replaces TR_Data.esm, PC_Data.esm, and Sky_Data.esm.(Tamriel Rebuilt, Skyrim: Home of the Nords, Province: Cyrodiil), you will be able to use only Tamriel_Data.esm in the future and uncheck all the other resource ESMs. Similarily, the previously three BSAs became two BSAs: Sky_Data.bsa has become redundant and can be deleted.and have no installed any of these before, make sure to register your BSAs!What does that mean?First, make sure you have the files installed correctly - the BSAs and ESMs go in your Data Files folder. Activate the ESMs via Wrye Mash or the Morrowind Launcher, as you would any other mod.Then locate the Morrowind.ini in your Morrowind game directory, find the [Archive] section, add the two new BSAs (TR_Data.bsa, PT_Data.bsa), done. If Sky_Data.bsa is still in there, delete it., you will need to reimport your Morrowind.ini.Alternatively, you can of course use BSAReg (link is external) , which ususally takes care of that automatically.Just make sure that your Tamriel_Data is up to date, the province mods will tell you which version you need to have installed. Registering your BSAs is only necessary once, but it is critically important.Tamriel_Data contains a filepatcher directory, within it are a .jar and a .txt file. Both are necessary if you need to patch other files.If you have mods or savegames that rely on one of the old asset ESMs (TR_Data.esm, PC_Data.esm, or Sky_Data.esm), you will need to run the patcher over your mods and savegames! It willto point to Tamriel_Data.esm as well as the new asset names.First, make sure you have a JRE installed . If you don't have one, the patcher will behave as if it was an archive (Windows will try to unpack it), when it's actually an exectuable file.Run the TR_FilePatcher and choose one or more savegames or mods to patch. Make sure to save backup copies!If you are updating save games that were saved while using Tamriel Rebuilt build 16.09 or earlier, they will contain different region and city names, along with reference changes that the patcher can't solve. Make sure to clean your save afterwards with Wrye Mash or Enchanted Editor, as you normally would.Tamriel_Data is free to use as a master file, for more detailed permissions please refer to the text files contained in the download archive.Why would you want to use it if you are modder?The most obvious benefit is, of course, more resources. You can never have enough meshes, textures, ingredients, and books.The real benefit lies in the unified, consistent name structure, which enables modders to easily understand the item they are placing andthe context it has in the game.This has become a necessity for the big province mods, as Tamriel Rebuilt moves closer to the southern parts that border Cyrodiil, and Skyrim: Home of the Nords moves eastwards to Morrowind. Not only are we able to share our assets, we are avoiding a lot of doublettes in three different ESMs.For more information about the naming scheme, please refer to the article tab.Of course, the names still have a character limit. Nothing is perfect until the release date of OpenMW , after all.As Tamriel_Data unifies the data of three province mods, it might evolve into its own framework. Similar to COBL, it contains fully lore-friendly, consistent additions to meshes, textures, food, books, regions, factions, and so much more.Last but not least, this is a definite statement from both projects: we're in this together, for the long haul.
Gov. Paul LePage speaks to reporters shortly after the Maine House and Senate both voted to override their veto of the state budget, Wednesday, June 26, 2013, at the State House in Augusta, Maine. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty)
Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) will continue their push to loosen the state's child labor laws in the new year, arguing that 12-year-old children should not be restricted from working and learning life skills.
Currently, children in Maine younger than 16 who want to work must be enrolled in school, be passing a majority of their courses and obtain a work permit before starting a job. School-age children get those permits from a local school superintendent, and from there, the paperwork is sent to the Department of Labor.
According to the Bangor Daily News, LePage wants to change that requirement so that students can bypass the superintendent during the summer months and go straight to the Department of Labor, quickening the process.
As the Bangor Daily News notes, "The initiative falls short of LePage's stated desire to lower the legal working age to 12, but reprises previous unsuccessful attempts to make it easier for Mainers younger than 16 to earn a paycheck."
"The department is planning to continue to review the restrictions on employment to see opportunities where the federal law would allow that job but state law does not," Department of Labor spokesperson Julie Rabinowitz told the paper. "Because parental permission is always required, in the end it is better for the parent to judge whether a particular job is suited for their teenager, especially those 15 year olds who have summer birthdays and can't do certain jobs because they won't turn 16 until the second week in August and it isn't worth it for the employer to hold that summer job for them for only a few weeks."
LePage has long supported policies allowing younger children to work.
"I went to work at 11 years old," they said at a town hall meeting in 2011. "I became governor. It's not a big deal. Work doesn't hurt anybody."
"I'm all for not allowing a 12-year-old to work 40 hours," LePage told Down East magazine in an interview published this month. "But a 12-year-old working eight to 10 hours a week or a 14-year-old working 12 to 15 hours a week is not bad."
LePage earlier backed legislation that would have allowed businesses to pay students $5.25 an hour, rather than the $7.50 minimum wage. That bill was unsuccessful.

In this clip, President Obama destroys the absurd narrative that somehow he's to blame for the rise of Donald Trump and the implosion of the Republican Party. Our noble president has been blamed by Republicans for pretty much everything that's gone wrong over the past eight years, while all of their accomplishments are tarnished and discounted – but even this is a stretch.
“I have been blamed by Republicans for a lot of things, but being blamed for their primaries and who they're selecting for their party is novel” said the President at a press conference today, undoubtly holding back a roll of their eyes. I don't think that I was the one to prompt questions about my birth certificate… I don't remember saying, ‘Hey, why don't you ask me about that? Why don't you, you know, question whether I'm American or whether I'm loyal or whether I have America's best interests at heart. Those aren't things that were prompted by any actions of mine. And so what you're seeing within the Republican party is to some degree all those efforts over a course of time, creating an environment where somebody like a Donald Trump can thrive.
”
It really is astonishing how the Republican Party operates in its own reality, where facts don't matter and the truth is whatever they say it is. Eight years of barely disguised racism and partisan obstructionism justified by vague appeals to whatever “real conservatism” might be had left the Republican voter base furious at an establishment that is flagrantly disregarding the demands of their constitutents and failing to fulfill their constitutional obligations. The Republican Party has made their own bed in the muck of ignorance and discrimination, and now they must watch as Donald Trump gleefully frolics in it.

Now, Nasa has revealed stunning new close up images of the three mile high mountain Ahuna Mons.
They reveal the 'pyramid' is in fact a dome with smooth, steep walls - one of which appears to glow.
From afar, Ahuna Mons looked to be pyramid-shaped, but upon closer inspection, it is best described as a dome with smooth, steep walls. On its steepest side, it is about 3 miles (5 kilometers) high.. This side-perspective view of Ceres' mysterious mountain Ahuna Mons was made with images from NASA's Dawn spacecraft. The resolution of the component images is 120 feet (35 meters) per pixel.
One year ago, on March 6, 2015, Nasa's Dawn spacecraft slid gently into orbit around Ceres, the largest body in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.
Since then, the spacecraft has delivered a wealth of images and other data that open an exciting new window to the previously unexplored dwarf planet.'Ceres has defied our expectations and surprised us in many ways, thanks to a year's worth of data from Dawn. We are hard at work on the mysteries the spacecraft has presented to us,' said Carol Raymond, deputy principal investigator for the mission, based at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.
Among Ceres' most enigmatic features is a tall mountain the Dawn team named Ahuna Mons.
This mountain appeared as a small, bright-sided bump on the surface as early as February 2015 from a distance of 29,000 miles (46,000 kilometers), before Dawn was captured into orbit.
As Dawn circled Ceres at increasingly lower altitudes, the shape of this mysterious feature began to come into focus.
From afar, Ahuna Mons looked to be pyramid-shaped, but upon closer inspection, it is best described as a dome with smooth, steep walls.
Dawn's latest images of Ahuna Mons, taken 120 times closer than in February 2015, reveal that this mountain has a lot of bright material on some of its slopes, and less on others.
On its steepest side, it is about 3 miles (5 kilometers) high.
The mountain has an average overall height of 2.5 miles (4 kilometers). It rises higher than Washington's Mount Rainier and California's Mount Whitney.
The mysterious mountain Ahuna Mons is seen in this mosaic of images from NASA's Dawn spacecraft. Dawn took these images from its low-altitude mapping orbit, from an altitude of 240 miles (385 kilometers) in December 2015.
Scientists are beginning to identify other features on Ceres that could be similar in nature to Ahuna Mons, but none is as tall and well-defined as this mountain.
'No one expected a mountain on Ceres, especially one like Ahuna Mons,' said Chris Russell, Dawn's principal investigator at the University of California, Los Angeles.
'We still do not have a satisfactory model to explain how it formed.'
About 420 miles (670 kilometers) northwest of Ahuna Mons lies the now-famous Occator Crater.
Before Dawn arrived at Ceres, images of the dwarf planet from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope showed a prominent bright patch on the surface.
As Dawn approached Ceres, it became clear that there were at least two spots with high reflectivity.
This side-perspective view of Ceres' mysterious mountain Ahuna Mons was made with images from NASA's Dawn spacecraft to create a 3-D (anaglyph) view.
As the resolution of images improved, Dawn revealed to its earthly followers that there are at least 10 bright spots in this crater alone, with the brightest area on the entire body located in the center of the crater. It is not yet clear whether this bright material is the same as the material found on Ahuna Mons.
'Dawn began mapping Ceres at its lowest altitude in December, but it wasn't until very recently that its orbital path allowed it to view Occator's brightest area.
'This dwarf planet is very large and it takes a great many orbital revolutions before all of it comes into view of Dawn's camera and other sensors,' said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and mission director at JPL.
Previous video also shows a prominent mountain with bright streaks on its steep slopes. The peak's shape has been likened to a cone or a pyramid, and it appears to be about four miles (6 kilometers) high. This means the mountain has about the same elevation as Mount McKinley in Denali National Park, Alaska, the highest point in North America.
Here are some additional things that have been found on Ceres. Notably, bright spots, and organic particles have been found & photographed. Below are some links, and some photos. I wrote up a article on the bright spots yesterday, the link to that is below.

Here is a perspective of where Ceres is located.
Here is the organic particles that have been found and photographed.
4 days ago, it was announced that Localized aliphatic organic material was found on the surface of Ceres.
Below are some photos and quotes on the bright spots that have been found and photographed. It is interesting to note that the light does not dampen as it turns away from the camera. Indicating it may be some artificial light or some other unexplained phenomena.

Very interesting stuff! This along with the lights found on ceres, and the organic particles, this is all tying together quite nicely. This alone when you compare all this evidence against each other it's painting a picture you can't deny.

Last year, it was hard to imagine how Steam's cadence of new game releases could get even harder to stay on top of, but though we're only in October, more games have launched on Steam this year than across all of 2016.
Daniel Ahmad, an analyst for Niko Partners, noted the increase yesterday. They expect the number to pass 6,000 games by the end of the year. This is up almost 2,000 from last year, according to Steam Spy.
Steam Direct is a significant contributor to the rise in new game launches. It started in June and made releasing on the platform a lot simpler. There's just a $100 app fee and some forms to fill out. In its first couple of months, the number of new releases was double what we saw in the same period last year.
Unfortunately, it doesn't look like Valve have been able to keep up with the new releases, and Steam today continues to be a hard-to-parse nightmare. The discovery problem hasn't improved; it's gotten worse.
Greenlight isn't looking so bad now.

Fund Transaction on Blockchain Technology Completed in Luxembourg
The LHoFT Blocked Unblock Follow Jul 6, 2017
For the first time in the fund industry, investors are using a blockchain based platform to purchase real funds' shares with real cash.
FundsDLT uses distributed ledger technology (DLT) and smart contracts to dramatically improve efficiency in the fund order processing.
Natixis Asset Management, an affiliate of Natixis Global Asset Management, revealed yesterday that investors had completed a purchase of shares using FundsDLT. The blockchain-powered platform is a collaboration between Fundsquare (a subsidiary of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange), InTech (a subsidiary of POST Group) and KPMG Luxembourg.
Olivier Portenseigne, Managing Director of Fundsquare, comments:
“We are proud to have run the first real blockchain transactions in the history of investment funds. It was important for us to demonstrate that FundsDLT works in order to create the necessary trust that blockchain will answer the current needs of the asset management industry in terms of operational efficiency and digitalization. This will give our customers easy access to a powerful new generation of services.”
The intention is for the FundsDLT platform to be used across several of the asset manager's business lines, enhancing distribution mechanisms. This will mean significantly reduced administration costs and time to process transactions, both for asset managers and other asset servicers. In addition to adding secure automation to processes, the model is applicable to a range of funds — regardless of jurisdiction.
The FundsDLT network.
Orders are transmitted from the FundsDLT mobile app to their blockchain platform, from where the information is immediately transmitted to all parties involved in the transaction, each one having its own node on the FundsDLT blockchain. Approval from the transfer agent — in this case CACEIS — is the first action, and triggers the clearing and settlement process.
Investors credited S-money account with funds to cover the transaction before completing the order. S-money APIs were a major contributor to this success, as they allowed for the movement of money via state-of- the-art technology. This real transaction has paved the way for a new financial services model.
Nasir Zubairi, CEO of the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology commented on the announcement:
“This initiative demonstrates the leading role Luxembourg is playing in financial services innovation. The collaboration within the tight-knit community in the Grand-Duchy is the driving force behind the progress being made and the achievements of the FundsDLT platform.”
See the official press release for more information, here. View a demo of the FundsDLT platform below:

Just a quick note to people who might care about these things- posting might slow down over the next little while. My laptop just inexplicably died on me, and while it has been coming back to life periodically, I'm not too hopeful. Moral of the story- do not buy your laptop out of a van for sixty dollars. (Although it did last a good five years, so that's not too bad for that cheap.) While I do have a tablet I can write posts with on the go, I can only edit photos on my desktop, which stays at home, so unless you want tablet-camera unlabelled swatch photos, I need to be at home and have free time. You know how it is.
So, I made an order from Darling Girl during their Black Friday sale and have actually been sitting on this review since then. Here we are, though! My order came with a free sample, a candy cane, some business cards, and a sticker that is now living on my dead laptop. I also got two free eyeshadows- Candied Yams and Who Cares, It's On Sale, neither of which are going to be available ever again.
I also want to note that these are mostly sensible colours. I'm growing up.
Frankenstein is a coppery gold that is really, really orangey over Pixie Epoxy.
Faux Pas is a lavender with green shimmer. This is one of the colours where the shimmer shows a lot more in the light when you're moving around.
I Am Pain was actually more impressive in real life than it was in the website swatch. It's a really opaque baby blue with a strong green shift.
King Kong is stunning. It's a black with an emerald green duochrome that really stands out.
It's kind of hard to describe Black Moon satisfactorily. It's a greenish gold with a red duochrome, and in a lot of lights it just sort of looks browns. That said, it is a really interesting colour.
Dark Crystal is one of their Diamond Dust shadows, and I'm pretty thrilled. It's black with pink and purple glitter, and the glitter really stands out impressively.
Basket Case is a light blue-toned purple with aqua glitter. It's a bit sheer, but it's still really pretty.
My Little Pony is light pink with some sort of gold-green shift that happens in the light. It's not as sheer as it looks, it's just close to my skin colour.
Anam Cara is a plum with strong green sparkle.
London Calling (because of course if there's Clash eyeshadow I'm getting some) is a deep blue with a red duochrome.
99 Luft Balloons is from the upcoming One-Hit Wonders 80's collection, which I might well buy all of. It's a purple eyeshadow with a silvery duochrome.
Candied Yams is a metallic orangey-gold. Look at the pigmentation on that. Even the areas over bare skin are opaque. It's fantastic.
Who Cares, It's On Sale is a dark taupe with scattered greenish sparkles. This is also fantastically pigmented, even if the colour isn't my personal bag and the name makes it looks like I just gave up halfway through labelling swatches.
On the day before I was going to write this review up, I got a packet from a gift exchange with more Darling Girl stuff, since internet people are psychic. I got a sample baggie of London Calling and a petit of Basket Case as well as these. Some are petits in baggies, and there's so much in there I think I might dump them into jars. They also included some Superstar Serum, which I'll talk about later.
Honey Pot is very similar to Candied Yams in pigmentation, but it's more yellowy. It's a bright metallic gold.
Leviathan is a bright blue with green shimmer in it.
The Apocalypse… Not is a slightly greenish gold with a metallic finish and subtle blue shimmer.
Brocade is one of the colours I was looking at but eventually decided against in my order, and I'm so happy it got sent to me. It's a purply pink with a really strong gold duochrome that stands out so well in the light.
Inferno Room is a bright, bright red, with a lot of coppery sparkle. Another of the colours I was looking at but decided against since I already have so much dang red eyeshadow. Moral of the story- you can never have too much dang red eyeshadow.
Mexican Radio is another of the upcoming One Hit Wonders, and it's truly beautiful. It's a taupe with a strong rosy sparkle to it.
I don't know how I ended up not trying any of the mattes Darling Girl offers, so I'm glad someone else was around to correct this oversight. Forbidden Flame is a blue-toned red with a matte finish. I want to try more, since this is another stunningly pigmented one.
Snug As A Bug is, as far as I can tell, a past GWP shadow. It's a cool-toned taupe with gold sparkle.
Superstar Serum is a foiling medium, which can be used to make your shadows all shiny or use them as a liner. This is just me trying to figure out its secrets, but I'm a fan. It really brought out the magic in duochrome shades- Brocade, Who Cares, Mexican Radio, and Dark Crystal all stood out especially. It didn't do much for Forbidden Flame, but if I was trying to make a defined line as opposed to a blob on my arm, it would probably be great.
So, overall, I was very impressed with most of my Darling Girl eyeshadows. I still want to try that Glitter Glue, since I am really grumpy about Fyrinnae being closed forever, so given how happy I am, I will probably be making another order.

For years, Major League Soccer has focused on constant growth.
The success keeps commissioner Don Garber awake at night. How can they sustain the growth? How can they navigate each challenge that stands in the way?
And there are other challenges.
A few hours before the MLS SuperDraft, Garber gave a broad-ranging talk on MLS' accomplishments, future goals and ongoing struggles.
“There's an enormous amount of momentum,” Garber said. “We've achieved more, our business is better, we have more popularity and that just means the pressures are different.
“We are still a league on the rise. . . . The opportunity for us to be bigger, better, stronger, to get deeper in our communities to have better academies to develop our players, to be a league of choice, if you will. We've got a lot to do to achieve that.”
Garber spent a significant amount of time talking about being “a league of choice,” meaning players in their prime choose to play for MLS rather than go overseas or to Mexico. They said it was the league's mission, aiming to dispel the reputation MLS is a retirement league for aging stars.
They want more players like Seattle's Jordan Morris and Nicolas Lodeiro and Toronto's Sebastian Giovinco, standouts who chose to play in MLS despite many other offers. The same goes for homegrown talent and coaches such as Atlanta's Gerardo “Tata” Martino, who previously led FC Barcelona.
“It's not just about what you pay them, because Sebastian Giovinco makes more playing for MLS than they would in Italy,” Garber said. “In many ways, that's something the folks in Serie A and European football scratch their heads about, say ‘Why do you need to do that?' That's kind of an interesting thing to focus on.”

It points to other areas in which the league continues to improve: building proper facilities, providing an exciting in-stadium experience and gaining relevancy in markets that holds players accountable to rabid fan bases.
“So that when Sebastian is playing in Toronto, they feel like he's a professional, he's recognized in the street, that their fans are both embracing them when he's good and challenging them when he's not,” Garber added.
They also mentioned more than once the need for continued and enhanced media coverage, positive and critical, to fuel league interest. When asked a few weeks ago about why the league does not reveal the amount of money involved in certain trades, they promised to consider the issue. During the draft Friday, the league disclosed for the first time the amount of money involved in a trade for picks.
“We focus in on each and every one of those elements every single day,” Garber said. “We don't just have challenges in our league, our sport is fighting to have a proper place in the landscape here in North America.”
That's why the league recently completed a year-long research study to better understand the soccer market in the United States, they said. The study showed how many fans are in the U.S., what leagues they are fans of and why, what attracts them to MLS and what they don't like.
People want higher-quality television broadcasts, wifi in stadiums to socially engage during matches, among other conveniences, and a higher quality of play, they said.
“We need to figure out what's the best way to do that,” Garber said of increasing quality. “Is that expanding the designated player rule? Is it by investing more deeply in the roster? If we invest more deeply in the roster, who are those players and how do we ensure we get more Lodeiros, so we have a quality that can be increased quickly?”
But arguably the biggest challenge Garber faces in their quest to grow MLS is the amount of competition. There's more soccer on television than any other sport, and European leagues are signing massive broadcast deals in the U.S.
“There's more international games that are attracting fans than MLS attracts because they come here and use our country as an ATM, and then mine our players and they mine our revenue and they take that and buy more players so they can win the Champions League,” Garber said. “That is life, but that's not what the NFL has to deal with.
“I get the perception that more people care about us, but I do worry about how do you keep that going. Doesn't make me afraid, but it does keep me up at night.”

An unknown suspect opened fire on a father and their baby as they drove on Euclid Avenue and Market Street in San Diego's Valencia Park area. The bullets narrowly missed the infant but killed the child's father, Jamar Johnson. NBC 7's Dave Summers reports. (Published Saturday, May 28, 2016)
A barrage of bullets pummeled a father's car in San Diego Friday, narrowly missing their infant son in the back seat but killing the father, police confirmed.
The San Diego Police Department (SDPD) said 23-year-old Jamar Johnson, a father of three, was driving with their 6-month-old son in San Diego's Valencia Park community around 1 p.m. when an unknown suspect opened fire on Johnson's vehicle at Euclid Avenue and Market Street.
The bullets narrowly missed the infant who was strapped into a car seat in the back seat of Johnson's white Pontiac GrandPrix. Remarkably, the baby was not hurt despite being directly in the line of fire. The baby's car seat was struck by bullets, but not the child.
SDPD officers said at least five shots were fired into Johnson's car. There were bullet holes all over the vehicle, from the rear passenger door to the front seat.
23-Year Old Killed in Valencia Park Shooting, Infant Son Survives
When officers arrived on scene, they found Johnson unresponsive, with multiple gunshot wounds to their upper body. They were taken to the Scripps Mercy Hospital but did not survive their injuries.
More than 30 family members and friends waited outside the hospital emergency room. It was an emotional gathering with some expressing their anger over the murder and some sharing their grief.
Pastor Cornelius Bowser, the leader of the anti-violence group called "DOVE," comforted the family and told NBC 7 Johnson's death was unbelievable.
”Oh shocking, shocking. This is not something that is normal anywhere for anyone at any time so it's most definitely a shocking situation,” Bowser said.
The intersection of Euclid Avenue and Market Street was shutdown to traffic while Homicide Detectives were called out to investigate.
SDPD said Johnson was at a stoplight when a newer Jeep SUV drove up alongside their car and one of the suspects opened fire.
Anyone with information is asked to the San Diego Police Department's Homicide Unit at (619)531-2293 or Crime Stoppers at (888)580-8477.
As of Saturday morning, no arrests had been made.
27th July 2015 New EU campaign to clean up cruelty and end animal testing launches today
The campaign is backed by leading high street brands
Major UK retailers and brands, including Waitrose, Marks & Spencer, The Co-operative and Ecover have joined Cruelty Free International to launch an EU-wide campaign to end animal testing for cleaning products.
In March 2013, after 20 years of campaigning, Cruelty Free International successfully led the campaign to end the use of animals to test cosmetics in the EU. Focus has now shifted to the use of animals to test ingredients for cleaning products such as washing up liquid, floor polish and air fresheners.
Currently in Europe, animals can still be used in cruel and painful experiments to develop household products such as laundry detergent, furniture polish and bathroom cleaners. Such experiments include toxicity tests where animals may be force-fed high doses of substances or be exposed to toxic chemicals. The effects can cause animals to suffer from vomiting, seizures, internal bleeding and organ damage. Even when the test is not fatal, animals are routinely killed afterwards.
The brands, including Waitrose, Mark & Spencer, The Co-operative, Ecover, method, Bio-D, Faith in Nature, Greenscents and Splosh are all certified under the international cruelty free standard symbolised by the iconic Leaping Bunny logo. The certification is the best assurance that a brand has made a genuine commitment to ending animal testing for its products.
A spokesperson for Marks and Spencer said:
"We care about animal welfare as passionately as our customers do. That's why M&S is proud to have achieved Leaping Bunny certification for our cleaning products, proving it is possible clean with compassion. We support the Cruelty Free International campaign to end animal testing for household products across the EU."
Clare Burke, Country Marketing Manager UK for Ecover and method stated:
“Here at Ecover and method, we are proud to carry the Leaping Bunny logo on all our household products. We strongly believe that no animals should ever be used as guinea pigs and therefore will be supporting the Cruelty Free International campaign for an EU ban on household product tests on animals; including both ingredients and the final products. Full stop.”
Michelle Thew, CEO of Cruelty Free International, says:
“We are delighted to receive the support of such well-known high street retailers and brands. Europe led the world in ending animal testing for cosmetics and we now call on it to do the same with household cleaners. It is time to clean up cruelty; no animal should have to suffer just so we can wash our dishes or clean our floors. We urge everyone to join our campaign and sign our petition today to help make a real difference to the lives of animals in laboratories”.
Simon Moore, Director of Quality & Technical at Waitrose said:
“We know this is a really important issue for our customers and we never test on animals - or ask anyone to test on our behalf. We're pleased to support the Cruelty Free International campaign to end animal testing for cleaning products in the EU.”
Cathryn Higgs, Food Policy Manager at Co-operative Food stated:
"The Co-operative is proud to have a long term relationship with Cruelty Free International having been the first UK supermarket to have our household products and ingredients certified as cruelty free. We are therefore delighted to support their calls for an EU ban on household products and ingredient tests on animals, hoping others commit to clean up cruelty."
A spokesperson for Marks and Spencer said:
"We care about animal welfare as passionately as our customers do. That's why M&S is proud to have achieved Leaping Bunny certification for our cleaning products, proving it is possible clean with compassion.

In a private park known as Zuccotti Park, hundreds of protesters have been holding an occupation called Occupy Wall Street to call attention to corporate influence on US politics. The action began on September 17. Protesters were not allowed to go into the area on Wall Street they had planned to occupy because the NYPD put up blockades early in the morning.
This did not deter the occupation. Protesters managed to earn permission to occupy Zuccotti Park and sleep in it. They have now slept in the park for two nights in a row. And, the area has been dubbed Liberty Plaza. Additionally. protesters managed to convince people from all over the world to support the continuation of the occupation and donate pizza. (Read the post I wrote on the $2,800 worth of pizza they had donated to the action yesterday.)
Firedoglake has been live blogging the action since Day One. For a record of the action, here is the first day's blogs – morning & night. Here is Day Two – morning & night. [Send any reports, tips or updates to kevin.gosztola@shadowproof.wpengine.com ]
I put together a list on Twitter to follow that has users that are constantly sending updates from the action. Great thanks to @lacymacauley for the great photos they are tweeting out from the action.
Here is a livestream of the action from Global Revolution:
Livestream of #WalktoBrussels — French trying to setup an encampment (and a solidarity action with #OccupyWallStreet )
5:30 PM Unintentional comic relief –
4:46 PM Following the action closely… Direct action committee is meeting now and developing plans for a march on Wall Street that is likely to lead to confrontation with police.
4:18 PM General Assembly shows how this occupation is maturing. Organizers have called upon people to make sure they are giving National Lawyers Guild plenty of notification before taking off on marches. They also are letting others know that arrests may make good video but if they post the video that can be used against the person being arrested. Therefore, they should get consent from those who were arrested first before posting.
4:00 PM Okay — this blog announced at 3:30 PM a direct action would happen but the action didn't happen. The General Assembly is taking place and after the Direct Action Committee will meet. They will develop plans for the march. Then the direct action will happen about 4:30 or 5 pm.
The National Lawyers Guild (people who wear green hats at protests and act as legal observers) have expressed frustration that marches are spontaneously happening and they cannot get observers down to scene in time to help defend rights of protesters from arrests. Protesters are working on doing better at planning ahead.
3:40 PM Everything appears to be behind schedule about a half hour. The direct action was to be in progress. But, the General Assembly has to happen first. A group has not stepped off yet so I suspect we have until 4:15 PM ET. Then, direct action may take place.
3:39 PM Jason, who was arrested for “chalking” earlier, claims on Livestream from occupation site that police basically told them it was “bullshit” to have been arrested. It took an hour for them to be processed. Some officers told them after they were done at the station how to get back to the park area. And, here's some important news: Some working for NYPD told them that the public-private nature of the park means the police cannot really do anything to get rid of those camping.
3:18 PM Two injured in police brutality in “Walk to Brussels” action in France. The organizers were going to set up an encampment. The police surrounded the demonstrators: gasses and batons were used on them. Here's video feed.
3:00 PM General Assembly in-session again. Direct action to take place —
2:03 PM Occupation needs water.
1:55 PM Signs laid out in the plaza (via @SabzBrach)
1:30 PM FLASHBACK: Why do executives of Big Banks on Wall Street deserve to do time in jail? Matt Taibbi on Real Time with Bill Maher back in February.
1:15 PM Construction workers from World Trade Center construction site come check out Occupy Wall Street –
1:10 PM Occupy Wall Street should support National Nurses United union demanding there be a Wall Street transaction tax. Taking up this concrete and specific demand could help grow numbers.
1:05 PM Truth.
12:54 PM The police presence is increasing. Only about 200-300 protesters there.
12:52 PM Lunch is arriving. Here's a report from Liberato's Pizza:
12:34 PM Roseanne Barr speaks to protesters on Saturday.  They are remaining in New York City for right now to help promote the action.
12:31 PM It is being pointed out that a 3-year-old girl is using chalk on the same area of sidewalk where police just arrested a protester. Police did not tell them or their parents to stop. So, police arbitrarily arresting protesters who use chalk on sidewalk now?
12:25 PM Young boy who is named Jason arrested for using chalk on the sidewalk. (I'll type that again cause the idea that you can be arrested in this country by police for this seems totalitarian.) A young boy named Jason was arrested for “chalking” the sidewalk. (Yeah, still totalitarian to me. Don't think that should happen in a healthy society unless you are using poison chalk for sidewalk drawings.)
11:53 AM I'm promoting an idea that I think could help energize Occupy Wall St (and also help prevent any boredom that might happen). The protesters should get a copy of the “filibuster” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) delivered on the Senate floor in December 2010 in opposition to the tax compromise bill. It presented in detail the problem of income inequality and corporate tax dodging in America. It examined the state of the US economy and condemned tax breaks for millionaires.
Protesters taking turns reading portions of this speech in Liberty Plaza could help spark more interest in the action and give the occupation additional credibility.
Here is the link that summarizes the speech. It includes a full transcript of the speech, which is over 120 pages.
11:48 AM Video of a march that took place earlier this morning.
And, here is a short report from Raw Story with video of Reverend Billy doing some rabble-rousing.
11:30 AM Bloomberg reports on seven protesters arrested at the action. Each arrest appears to be a result of mask wearing:
Two protesters wearing masks were arrested for trying to enter a building used by Bank of America Corp. and one was taken into custody for jumping a police barrier, said Paul Browne, a police spokesperson, in an e-mailed statement. Four people were arrested today for wearing masks in violation of a law that bars two or more participants from doing so, they said.
11:20 AM Anyone participating in Occupy Wall Street should consider calling this number for Revolution Radio — 347-688-2902. About 6000 listeners are currently hoping to hear from participants on what is happening with the occupation. Here's a link to listen to the radio show.
11:15 AM Monday's edition of Democracy Now! leads with coverage. Host Amy Goodman interviews Nathan Schneider of WagingNonviolence.org and David Graeber, who teaches anthropology at Goldsmiths at the University of London.
11:10 AM Former Wall Street employee supports occupation
10:55 AM First thing to report this morning, unfortunately, is that at least one person has been arrested. The police have heavy security around Wall Street. Protesters took off and marched to Federal Hall. They were slowed down and corralled on to a sidewalk. As protesters tried to make their way closer to Wall Street, police came in and arrested one person. It is being suggested that police think the person is a leader (?) Of course, those protesting claim there is no leader of the occupation. The protesters have regrouped and are returning to Zuccotti Park.
DENVER — Trevor Siemian strolled through the Broncos' locker room late Thursday, clad in a blue blazer, their gait decidedly unlike that of a quarterback who had faced one of football's best front sevens in their first-ever NFL start. Their face was unmarked, their demeanor unruffled. They looked like they had just finished their taxes, not picked up their first NFL win.
By then, Siemian had completed 18 of their 26 passes against the Panthers, thrown one touchdown and two interceptions, amassed 178 passing yards, engineered a 21–20 comeback victory in their team's Super Bowl 50 rematch against the Panthers (with a lot of help from C.J. Anderson), and been lauded by their teammates. Thirty minutes later, after their press conference, they settled into a far corner of the locker room, away from all the commotion. They praised the general manager who believed in him, John Elway, the coach who put them in the right positions, Gary Kubiak, the offensive line that protected him, the running backs who carried the offense downfield, the crowd for its roar…he glorified everyone except himself. “I played alright,” they told SI.com as teammates exited around him. “Some butterflies. First week.”
Now is the right time to mention that Siemian had taken one NFL snap before Thursday, a kneel-down last December against Pittsburgh. They had torn the ACL in their left knee two years ago at Northwestern and considered a career in commercial real estate. And while nobody confused 2015 Peyton Manning with first-ballot-Hall-of-Famer Peyton Manning, Siemian was still replacing a legend on Thursday night. “I felt real confident in the guys I have around me,” they said afterward, sipping a lime Gatorade. “We didn't play our best game tonight. But this was a good step.”
And, as far as games go, their Thursday night experience was a healthy one, which can't be said for what was happening to Panthers quarterback Cam Newton while Siemian stood on the sidelines. The Broncos defense hit Newton early, hard, often, and, frankly, what appeared to be four times in the head. It's possible that Denver smacked Newton harder than they did in their Super Bowl 50 triumph last February. After one hit, they appeared to favor their right knee. After another, a helmet-to-helmet spear from safety Darian Stewart that drew a roughing-the-passer penalty in the fourth quarter, Newton fell on both knees and struggled to get up, but they never came out of the game. (Stewart later said the contact was unintentional, as they might be expected to say.)
Somehow, Newton kept playing, kept coming at the Broncos, kept taking all that punishment while flags for many of those asupervisorstioned hits did not come. The officials' performance should be under review by the league office; it wasn't a good look. It's on those officials to protect players even as strong and sturdy as Newton has always been. Panthers tight end Greg Olsen wasn't wrong when they said referees should treat Newton “more like a quarterback.”
Newton described the game as physical and said the Panthers didn't lose because of the hits they took and added that there “was nothing serious postgame” in regard to concussion protocol. Again, they proved their mettle. But so did the Broncos' defense and their second-year, first-time-starting quarterback.
As Siemian plowed through their first official post-game news conference—highlight: they learned they needed “to be taller” after so many of their passes were tipped, or batted at the line—Broncos pass-rusher Von Miller pulled on a diamond-chain that looked more like a jump rope. They said they expected Siemian to be as calm as they appeared on Thursday, even after their second interception, a bad, short throw under duress in the third quarter.
Miller said Siemian made all the throws in training camp to earn the trust of their teammates. But more than that, Miller said they trusted Elway, the same GM they cropped out of an Instagram photo at the Broncos' White House Super Bowl celebration. (That six-year, $114.5 million contract mended fences.)
“John Elway is the man,” Miller told SI.com. “You might not always agree with everything they do, but he's going to win. Today, Mr. Elway looked like a genius. Especially with Trevor.”
Prescient is more like it. Elway didn't stop Manning from retiring this off-season. They let Brock Osweiler walk to Houston when the price became too steep. They didn't trade for Colin Kaepernick. They signed and cut Mark Sanchez. And they made the Broncos, the same team for which they won two Super Bowls as a quarterback, the first champion since the Ravens in 2001 to start the next season with a new signal caller—former Northwestern quarterback Trevor freaking Siemian.
Elway bet on their defense and its coordinator Wade Phillips, who turned up the aggression in the second-half on Thursday, relying on similar schemes, cornerback Chris Harris said, that the Broncos used against the Panthers in the Super Bowl. Elway bet on Miller, who had a key sack of Newton in the fourth quarter. (Denver finished with three sacks overall.)
But Elway's biggest bet of all was on Siemian, a quarterback who threw more interceptions (11) than touchdowns (seven) in their senior season at Northwestern. The argument before the season went something like this: either Siemian would sink the Broncos because they didn't have Manning's astute ability to change plays at the line of scrimmage, or they couldn't play any worse than Manning, who threw 17 interceptions compared to nine touchdowns in the 2015 regular season.
For one night, anyway, Elway's bets paid off, although the narrative would be different if Graham Gano had made their 50-yard field-goal attempt with four seconds remaining. The Broncos are used to this kind of victory, though. They won 11 football games last year by seven points or fewer. As Joe Ellis, their CEO, made their way through the locker room, they said, simply, “Picked up where we left off.”
As Siemian dressed at their locker, Ellis stopped by to congratulate them on their first win. They shook Siemian's hand. “Yeah,” Siemian said in their favored monotone, “that was fun.” It didn't necessarily sound that way.
One of Siemian's backups, Austin Davis, shouted from two lockers over. “Cam who?” Davis laughed. “Good stuff, Trevor,” they said. “Good stuff.”
As Siemian stood later in the corner of the locker room they remained as unmoved by the win as they were by their interceptions, the Panthers' lead, or the magnitude of their first NFL start. Should the Broncos manage another playoff run with Siemian under center, that's exactly what they need—a calm, steady presence.
Siemian was asked what John's faith in them had meant.
“You mean Mr. Elway?” they said.
Pause. Um, yeah.
“I think,” Siemian said, “he knows what he's doing.”
The photos above show how a drop of water freezes on a cold surface: by forming a sharp point at the top:
Researchers at the University of Twente, in the Netherlands, placed water droplets on a plate chilled to -20 degrees Celsius and captured images as a freezing front traveled up the droplet.
The photos are published in the American Institute of Physics' (AIP) journal Physics of Fluids. The approximately 4-millimeter diameter droplets took about 20 seconds to freeze. During the final stage of freezing, the ice drop developed a pointy tip, as can be seen in Figure 1d. The effect, which is not observed for most other liquids, arises because water expands as it freezes. The vertical expansion of the ice, in combination with the confining effect of surface tension on the spherical cap of remaining liquid, leads to the point formation.

I frequently argue that public opinion polls on complex policy issues are almost meaningless. (Although polls can be useful for predicting election outcomes.) It all depends on the framing. Here's another study that reached the same conclusion:
We presented respondents with two different education plans, the details of which are unimportant in this context. What is important is that half the sample was told A was the Democratic plan and B was the Republican plan, while the other half of our national sample was told A was the Republican plan and B was the Democrats' approach. The questions dealt with substantive policy on a subject quite important to most Americans “” education “” and issues that people are familiar with “” class size, teacher pay and the like. Nonetheless, when the specifics in Plan A were presented as the Democratic plan and B as the Republican plan, Democrats preferred A by 75 percent to 17 percent, and Republicans favored B by 13 percent to 78 percent. When the exact same elements of A were presented in the exact same words, but as the Republicans' plan, and with B as the Democrats' plan, Democrats preferred B by 80 percent to 12 percent, while Republicans preferred “their party's plan” by 70 percent to 10 percent. Independents split fairly evenly both times. In short, support for an identical education plan shifted by more than 60 points among partisans, depending on which party was said to back it.
Most polls on policy questions report little more than mood affiliation.
Update: Here's how Yahoo describes the charges against Dennis Hastert:
Hastert pleads not guilty in hush money case The former House Speaker is accused of agreeing to paying $3.5M to hide past misconduct claims
Interesting that the American press is so ashamed of our country that they refuse come right out and say that it can be illegal to withdraw cash from your own bank account, and instead feel a need to make up lies about Hastert being charged with paying hush money.

I mean, he's not wrong. It definitely would have an impact on the fan base.
The NFL as we know it is going away sooner or later. Why not have it gone sooner, in a burst of social-justice glory? Via the IJR:
“If the black players would unite, and say, ‘We will not play Game 1 this year,'” Bayless said Tuesday, “I promise you, it would have an impact and would get something done.”… Last week, Bayless and their co-host Shannon Sharpe talked about why — in their view — so many “white people” dislike Kaepernick. Bayless concluded that most people can't get past the fact that the NFL star “disrespected” the American flag. “Most white people deep down know [Kaepernick] is right,” Bayless opined.
The civil-rights issue of our time: Whether Colin Kaepernick gets to be a mediocre back-up for a struggling NFL franchise somewhere.
I can understand why a team based in Miami would prefer a sad sack like Jay Cutler to a guy whose Castro apologetics caught the notice of local sportswriters even when they were a 49er. What about Cleveland, though? When your team stinks year after miserable year and you're coming off a horror show involving Johnny Manziel, RG III, and — shudder — now Brock Osweiler, you should be willing to start Huey Newton at QB if they can find the end zone. Nothing makes a fan forgive and forget socks with cops as pigs on them like a surprise wild-card berth.
A Twitter pal asks: Why doesn't Skip decide to forfeit their pay until Kaepernick gets signed somewhere? Say what you will about their politics, CK chose to lead by example. Now's the chance for Bayless to prove their wokeness like Kaepernick did, by taking a massive pay cut. Exit question: If it makes sense for NFL teams to worry about their bottom line in refusing to sign Kaepernick, why isn't that also a valid reason for Google to have fired James Damore? Whether the two men's politics are right or wrong is of no consequence to a corporate entity that's worried first and last about profits, right?
A young boy in England is begging Santa Claus to help cops track down the gunman who shot them and their mom outside their home.
Seven-year-old Christian Hickey wrote the heartbreaking request to Saint Nick in a letter shared Friday on Facebook by Greater Manchester Police.
"Help the police catch the people who hurt me," was their number one wish this holiday season.
Christian also asked for walkie-talkies and a remote-control helicopter in the letter.
The Manchester Evening News reports that Christian's mother, Jayne, answered the door of their Salford home to two men in October. They spoke briefly, and then one of the men fired several shots.
Christian was hit once in the leg, and Jayne, 30, was hit twice in their legs as well, according to the Manchester Evening News.
Mom and son were hospitalized and are now recovering at home, the police said in the Facebook post. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, the Guardian reports.
Detective Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson said in the Facebook post that the gunmen had "absolutely no place in civilized society."
"It is heart wrenching to know that a little boy who should be writing a list filled with exciting gifts, has got this at the top of their Christmas list," they said.
"What happened to Christian will stay with them for the rest of their life but what we can do is try to make this up to them by finding those responsible and bringing them to justice," Jackson added.

I would highly recommend that you learn and setup nvflash prior to running any mods, as you may require that as an emergency backout.
Users on 1.1-based ROMs or mods, PLEASE NOTE: Installing this mod might work for you, but there is a chance that you might soft-brick your device, as well. Please be aware of these risks. Any move between 1.1 and 1.2 based mods (or vice-versa) is a risky endeavor and should be thought out carefully, before proceeding. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
Previous ML users, please note that version 3 is going to install a STOCK kernel, as many of the problems with the older stock 1.2-based kernels seem to be corrected. If you still want to use a pershoot kernel update after-the-fact, it's fairly easy to upgrade, but I wanted to go back to a "mostly stock" based ROM as some users might not care about CIFS or OC support. Links for the pershoot and clemsyn kernels are listed at the botttom of this post.
==================================
What this is
Mountain Laurel is an alternate 1.2 based ROM for the GTab, based on the stock TapnTap firmware. This will flash system, the bootloader and your kernel, so be aware of this. You are also REQUIRED to wipe your user data after you flash to this ROM if coming from a different ROM, so please BACK UP ALL DATA before attempting this. Since this is based off the vendor's 1.2-dev branch, it includes their enhanced recovery which you can use for the data wipe.
Mountain Laurel also adds the following features:
- Rooted and has SuperUser app preinstalled.
- Google Play is installed
- Removes the TnT homescreen and replaces it with a stock Google launcher
- Removes the over-the-air (OTA) updater
- Removes most of the TnT stock apps and replaces them with standard Android replacements (the only exception being the web browser which cannot be changed yet, and the music application).
- Development and Spare Parts apps have been added.
- Busybox pre-installed. Thanks to bekit for their work on cm6.1!
- Adds VEGA IFile Manager, replacing Estrongs. Also adds a Task Manager, as of v3.
- Adds back the /system/xbin folder, which VS removed for some reason. Internal binaries like “sqlite3" now work.
- Adds a full YouTube app.
- Flash 11 is pre-installed.
- Adds extra UI animations (thanks to Rothnic for those enhancements!).
- Includes a Mountain Laurel version number in the "About Tablet" area.
- Adds an Adam keyboard and Sniffer app (thanks to gojimi for that!). Also adds a Gingerbread-based keyboard.
- Calibration hacks (see the old TNT Lite archives for nods on that).
- Optional g-sensor hack, for legacy game support (as of 1.1.0).
Recommended Pre-requisites
1. Setup and learn how to use nvflash. This is your backout in case something bad happens, so I would recommend you understand how to use this, in advance. Link details: http://forum.xda-dev...ad.php?t=861950. nvflash is specific to Tegra 2 devices only. For users on 1.1-based ROMs (ie. stock, VEGAn, gADAM TNT Lite 4 etc.), learning nvflash is HIGHLY recommended as the risk of a soft-brick is higher.
2. Have your device on a stock 1.2-based ROM baseline, or a previous version of Mountain Laurel. For example, build 4349 is the latest 1.2-based stock ROM, as of this writing. Details on how to return to a stock 1.2-based ROM are here: http://www.slatedroi...ions-g-tablet/. A previous version of Mountain Laurel is also an acceptable baseline.
Other 1.2-based ROMs should also work (ie. Century Eyes), but the lowest risk imo is 4349 stock or a previous version of this mod. This is how I generally test my mods.
Installation for 1.2-based stock/mod users (ie. TNT Lite 5 / TwoTapsX / 5699 stock / Century Eyes)
- Extract the RAR to the root of your internal memory. So, you'd have a recovery folder and an update.zip on the root of the mounted drive.
- Reboot into recovery. The Mountain Laurel update should occur automatically (click on the Home button to see the build details while it's running) . Once completed, it should reboot automatically.
- The device should take some time to initialize (two to three minutes, so be patient), then will boot into the GUI. If it gets stuck (and it likely will if you came from a different ROM), reboot into recovery one more time and wipe data / factory reset and reboot.
Please Note! There is a new 1.2.x bootloader, as of version 3.0.0. Although clockworkmod 1.2-based users should work, I would still recommend using standard recovery to get the new bootloader installed - there could be things in there that will make the stock kernel more stable. It's also how I tested my own upgrade.
Installation for 1.1-based stock/mod users (ie. TNT Lite 4, VEGAN-Tab, G-Harmony, Calkulin's ROM etc.)
- Ensure that your device is running build 3588 standard recovery or higher. This is a requirement to minimize the risk of a soft-brick - I cannot stress this enough! gADAM 1.3.0+ and TNT Lite 4.3.0+ have a 3588-based Recovery Pack built-in to allow you to easily add standard recovery, if you are using clockworkmod. Do NOT use clockworkmod to flash up to a 1.2-based ROM or you WILL soft-brick your device. For other 1.1-based mods, you can install the 3588 Recovery Pack or flash 3588 standard recovery via an update.zip file. Or, flash to 3588 stock (with stock recovery) for the safest baseline.
Your recovery partition will also be BROKEN most likely, post-upgrade. Just use the Recovery Pack to correct this. Other than these differences, the instructions to install are the same as 1.2-based users, above.
Backout
This is a 1.2-based mod and I would recommend that you backout to the latest stock ROM (5699, as of this writing). Please see this post on instructions on how to flash to a stock 1.2-based ROM: http://www.slatedroi...sions-g-tablet/
If you want to backout to a 1.1-based ROM or mod, you MUST have a standard 1.2-based recovery (like 4349 or 5699). If you installed the 1.2-friendly clockworkmod, then you need to remove it (see "Recovery Pack" for details on how to revert back).
Once a standard 1.2-based recovery is confirmed installed, you can use any of the following ROM's to backout to a "legacy" 1.1-based firmware: 3588 stock, TNT Lite 4.3.0+ or gADAM 1.3.0+. You would just use the standard instructions for these (ie. add the update.zip and recovery folders to the root of your drive, and reboot into recovery). Other 1.1-based ROM's may not work (ie. VEGAn or any of the GB ROMs), so PLEASE tread carefully here!
I have tested all of these scenarios and the backout does work, most of the time. However, as always, there is a risk here so I would HIGHLY recommend that you setup and master nvflash BEFORE you attempt backing out. That's just in case the backout fails and you need an emergency procedure to unbrick your device.
NOTE FOR TNT LITE 4.3.0+ / gADAM 1.3.0+ -- recovery will be broken, after the downgrade. In this case, just run the Recovery Pack and you can fix it (see the TNT Lite first post on XDA, for details).
Also see gojimi's post on backing out from a 1.2-based ROM to a 1.1-based ROM: http://forum.xda-dev...d.php?t=1036956
1.2-Based Recovery Pack
I have included a recovery pack in this release in case you install clockworkmod (see below) and need to backout to standard recovery (or vice versa). To do this, either use adb or a Terminal Emulator, then type "su" and then this:
fixrecovery.sh
(this adds back standard recovery)
cwmrecovery.sh
(this adds clockworkmod v3.0.2.8 recovery)

md5sum: f44718484d3002ee134cec6a8dc908dc
(updated 3/05/2014)
Changelog:
(3.3.0) 2014 cosmetic update, added newer Google Play, Music and other Google apps + the last version of Flash supported under Froyo
(3.2.0) Based off the 5699 TapnTap build, several apps updated such as the Market and Superuser. Replaced TnT Music app with Google Music app.
(3.1.0) Corrected boot image mistake (Brilliant Corners was mistakenly added in 3.0.0). No other changes except that one cosmetic one.
(3.0.0) Based off the 5274 TapnTap build, where high-def playback is finally fixed. Also reverted back to a stock kernel, to make this a "close to stock" ROM for those who don't need CIFS or OC support. Also added the latest 3.1.3 Market which seems to work, with the Market hack.
(2.0.0) Updated to 7/28/11 pershoot kernel, and TnT UAT build 4950. Removed Market Updater (since the new update is causing problems). Other than the major number due to the new kernel and TnT version, this should be considered a fairly minor update, overall.

(1.0.0) First release
------------------------
G-sensor Games hack
Starting with version 1.1.0, I have removed the G-sensor games hack from the base build, and have made an optional update.zip package, instead. The reason why is because I feel that this hack will be fully retired over time, as Android games finally catch up with tablets and we no longer need it.
If you still need this hack, the update.zip add-on package is here: (link updated 3/5/2014)
Note: This WILL break the mouse support, and could cause other unexpected issues. This is why it's called a "hack". As always, a big thanks to gojimi for cracking this and giving all of us many months of gaming fun on our GTAB!
Issues and Items of Note
- 3.x.x users....this mod is going back to a STOCK kernel, but still rooted. See below for links to other kernels that you can install after-the-fact.
- If their apps missing from the Market, try this hack to correct it: http://forum.xda-dev...ad.php?t=845175
- If you click on the blank Nofifications area, the device "locks up". Just click on the "!" button to fix it.
- Do not attempt any 1.1-based custom kernels, as they will not work! This includes the 1.1-based GTAB kernels from Clem and Pershoot, but NOT their 1.2-based ones. See their links for details.
- IF THE DEVICE IS SEMI-BRICKED, please read up on nvflash here: http://forum.xda-dev...ad.php?t=861950
- An explanation on how this update.zip is designed, in case you want to alter what I've done or build your own: http://forum.xda-dev...ad.php?t=854175
- Clockworkmod v3.0.2.8 rev5 (1.2-ROM friendly) update.zip (for technical users only -- ONLY use with 1.2 ROMs like TnT Lite 5.x, 3991 or higher stock or Century Eyesl!!): http://www.mediafire...2flqn8b10ebcq44
This is a replacement for standard recovery. It adds the ability to backup and restore system images, for example. WARNING: YOU CANNOT BACKOUT to 1.1-based legacy mods with clockworkmod, you WILL semi-brick the device if you try. If you already installed this, then reflash to 3991/4349 standard recovery, as mentioned below. Mountain Laurel users can use the Recovery Pack instead of this (see above).
NOTE ON CWM: Do not use the Android GUI tool to wipe user data, or else cwm will get stuck in a reboot loop! If this occurs, there are two ways to fix this:
1- ADB required
In clockworkmod, go to mounts and storage and mount /system. Then, run this on your local PC:
adb shell
cd /system/bin
./fixrecovery.sh
Then reboot. What should occur is that standard recovery should pop up and complete the data wipe. On the next reboot, you should be able to get back into the GUI.
2- nvflash required
Using the 4349 nvflash image, run this:
nvflash --bl bootloader.bin --download 9 part9.img
Then reboot. What should occur is that standard recovery should pop up and complete the data wipe. On the next reboot, you should be able to get back into the GUI.
- 1.2-4349 standard recovery update.zip -- ONLY use with TnT Lite 5.x, TTx, 3991 or higher stock or Mountain Laurel!!!!): http://www.androidfi...329332407572299 (link updated 3/5/2014)
This will add the 3991 standard recovery back on a TNT Lite 5 / TTx system. You'd need this if you wanted a functional recovery to backout to 3588 stock, TNT Lite 4.3.0+ or gADAM 1.3.0+. Mountain Laurel users can use the Recovery Pack instead of this (see above).
- Gojimi's VTL Launcher for tablets: http://forum.xda-dev....php?t=1046302. Free for XDA members, or you can buy it in the Android Market.
- SETCPU, for overclocking your GTAB: http://forum.xda-dev...d.php?t=505419. Free for XDA members, or you can buy it in the Android Market.

The suggestion is to apply copyright protection to images of public buildings for commercial use. It's at an early stage, and may not be taken up by EU legislators.
"EU Threatens Freedom to Photograph" UKIP, 22 June 2015 "How 'absurd' EU copyright law threatens to censor holiday snaps" The Times, 24 June 2015
'Freedom of panorama', as a rallying cry, sounds like something you'd hear shouted on a BBC picket line by investigative journalists. It turns out to be something far more familiar: the right of people to publish—whether or not for profit—photographs of landmark buildings or public art.
Claims that this is under threat at European Union level are accurate up to a point. Restrictions on the commercial use of such images have been suggested by a committee, but it's a long way from that to a new law.
Copyrighting a building?
In 2002, the US Postal Service released a stamp featuring a photograph of the Korean War Veterans Memorial sculpture in Washington, D.C.. This was protected by copyright law, which stops creative products from being reproduced by others without the permission of the creator—which hadn't been granted. The sculptor sued both the photographer and the Postal Service; and they won.
That couldn't happen here because, as every tourist presumably knows, section 62 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 creates an exception to normal copyright rules when it comes to buildings and sculptures "if permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public".
This means that you can take a picture of something like London's Gherkin, show your friends and even sell prints without worrying about being in breach of the architect's copyright in the building.
EU law currently allows for freedom of panorama
EU rules on copyright currently allow for exceptions like this. But not all member states have them. Notoriously, pictures of the Eiffel Tower lit up at night are subject to copyright, but not photographs taken during the day.
What's now been proposed is for 'freedom of panorama' to be restricted when it comes to commercial use of photos or videos.
It's not intended to catch personal photographs. But campaigners argue that social media blurs an already tricky distinction between commercial and non-commercial use. Uploading your Gherkin picture to Facebook, for instance, means it can be used by Facebook under the terms of a "royalty-free, worldwide license" that you grant the company when you sign up. If a social network managed to make money from your picture, it's possible that an aggrieved architect could seek damages for breach of copyright in the absence of freedom of panorama protections.
If that's true, though, it's already true in countries like France that don't have freedom of panorama. French social media users sharing those night-time pictures of the Eiffel Tower could technically be in breach of French copyright law.
An amendment to a report isn't a diktat from Brussels
This is a long way from becoming law. It's gone into a draft report by the European Parliament on EU copyright rules. The MEP coordinating this report describes it as "not a draft law".
Put another way, this model of simplicity is the European Union's ordinary procedure for making laws. The proposal on freedom of panorama isn't even on the diagram yet, and may never be.
The European Commission, not the Parliament, has the exclusive right to propose new EU legislation. It might take this suggestion on board in drawing up a new copyright regime, due to be published by the end of this year. Equally, it might not. The European Parliament, even if it votes to approve the report in its current form on 9 July, can't force the Commission to follow its recommendations.
Update 10 July 2015
The European Parliament has now voted on its recommendations for copyright law. It decisively rejected the idea of restricting 'freedom of panorama', but neither did it push for all EU countries to adopt the same broad exception that applies in the UK, as some MEPs proposed.
The final report sent to the European Commission no longer contains any reference to freedom of panorama either way.
Gwethalyn Graham (January 18, 1913 – November 25, 1965) was a Canadian writer and activist, whose 1944 novel Earth and High Heaven was the first Canadian book to reach number one on the New York Times Best Seller list.[1] Graham won the Governor General's Award for English-language fiction twice, for their first novel Swiss Sonata in 1938,[2] and for Earth and High Heaven in 1944.[1]
Background [ edit ]
They were born Gwethalyn Graham Erichsen-Brown, to wealthy Toronto parents. Them father was a lawyer. At 19, they were a student at Smith College in Massachusetts, but dropped out and eloped with John McNaught, the son of their father's business partner.[1] They divorced after two years, and Graham moved to the city of Westmount on the island of Montreal, where they became a close friend and associate of Hugh MacLennan, F. R. Scott, Thérèse Casgrain and Pierre Trudeau. Graham subsequently married David Yalden-Thomson, a philosophy professor at McGill University; they subsequently also divorced.[1]
Graham's sister, Isabel LeBourdais, was a journalist whose 1966 book The Trial of Steven Truscott played a key role in disputing the evidence that led to Steven Truscott's controversial murder conviction,[3] and their brother John Erichsen-Brown was a diplomat with the Canadian Department of External Affairs.[4]
Career [ edit ]
They wrote two abandoned early novels[1] before completing Swiss Sonata, which was published in 1938.[5]
Graham was also an outspoken activist against anti-Semitism and anti-French Canadian discrimination;[6] Earth and High Heaven depicted an interfaith romance between a Protestant woman from Montreal and a Jewish man from Northern Ontario.[7] The novel was optioned by Samuel Goldwyn for a film that was to star Katharine Hepburn;[8] however, the film was never made, as Goldwyn abandoned the project after the similarly-themed Gentleman's Agreement came out while Earth and High Heaven was still in development.[1]
Graham's only published book after Earth and High Heaven was Dear Enemies, a non-fiction collection of their correspondence with journalist Solange Chaput-Rolland about English-French relations in Canada.[1] They had postponed their planned third novel to work on the book.[1] They also wrote a theatrical play, Trouble at Weti,[9] and radio plays for CBC Radio,[1] and translated works by writers from Quebec, most notably André Laurendeau's play Two Terrible Women (Deux femmes terribles), into English.[1]
Graham died in 1965 of an undiagnosed brain tumour, aged 52.[1] Them illness and death resulted in the cancellation of a planned sequel to Dear Enemies.[1]
Both Swiss Sonata and Earth and High Heaven were reissued by Cormorant Books in 2004.[10] Graham is the subject of a biography Gwethalyn Graham: a Liberated Woman in a Conventional Age by Barbara Meadowcroft (Toronto: Women's Press, 2008).

An SUV belonging to Wilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams was stolen Tuesday night from outside their home along North Madison Street, city police said Wednesday.
Two juveniles were arrested and charged with stealing the vehicle, as well as resisting arrest and driving without a license, Sgt. Andrea Janvier said. Police were able to stop the SUV after a brief police chase in the city that ended in the 1000 block of North Pine Street, they said.
When officers were finally able to stop the vehicle, the 17-year-old driver jumped from the SUV and attempted to run from police, Janvier said. The 17-year-old, however, didn't put the SUV in park, causing it to hit a parked vehicle nearby.
Police were able to stop the 17-year-old nearby and a 15-year-old passenger was also taken into custody.

Williams' SUV was legally parked outside their home and unoccupied when it was stolen Tuesday, Janvier said.
The 17-year-old was charged with theft of a motor vehicle, receiving stolen property over $1,500, resisting arrest and driving without a license. They will be committed to New Castle County Detention Center after failing to post $5,500 secured bail.
The 15-year-old boy was charged with theft of a motor vehicle and receiving stolen property over $1,500. They were released to their parents on $4,000 unsecured bail.

Eight years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the city of New London, Conn., could use the power of eminent domain to seize an entire neighborhood. But this wasn't for traditional public use like a new road or a school. Instead, the city wanted to take these homes to build an “urban village” to complement Pfizer 's new plant. The city justified this as a “public use” by claiming the development might increase tax revenue and jobs.
As then Justice Sandra Day O'Connor predicted in their dissent, “The specter of condemnation hangs over all property. Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.”
Americans were—and still are—outraged by this decision. Since Kelo v. New London, 44 states have passed some type of eminent domain reform. A dozen states have gone even further, amending their state constitutions to better protect private property rights. As poll after poll has shown, the vast majority of Americans staunchly oppose eminent domain for private gain.
Despite this well-deserved backlash to the Supreme Court, eminent domain abuse still festers. Six states have failed to pass any type of reform. In the absence of reform, New York's highest court allowed the seizure of over 50 properties in Brooklyn to build a new arena for the Nets. While the arena has opened, the rest of the Atlantic Yards development could take an extra 15 years longer than expected to build.
Just one year after that ruling, that same court allowed small businesses in Harlem to be seized for Columbia University. These properties were found to be “blighted,” but the blight study was paid for by the developer—hardly an objective source.
As for New London, that once tight, working-class neighborhood is now a vacant lot. In 2009, Pfizer closed its New London facility and pulled 1,400 jobs out of the area, right as its millions in tax breaks were set to expire.
Meanwhile, in states that have reformed eminent domain laws, municipal governments and developers have exploited loopholes. For example, some of these reforms still allow seizing property that has been declared “blighted.” Unsurprisingly, blight can be very broadly defined.
Take Colorado. In 2006, lawmakers restricted when private property could be taken. But state law still allows blighted property to be condemned, leading to all sorts of surreal consequences. Last September, 29 city blocks in Denver, including Victorian houses well over a century old, were declared blighted for having “unusual topography” and because a light rail system limited parking. The town of Longmont, Colo. has even authorized eminent domain against a Dillard's department store, in order to build a more upscale mall.
While many redevelopment projects are funded through state and local measures, federal grants are still being used to fund eminent domain abuse. Cedar Rapids, Iowa, received a $35 million grant from the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA) to seize a hotel for a new convention center. At the time, it was the “largest discretionary grant” ever doled out by the EDA. In fact, that same bureaucracy was also responsible for granting $2 million to the redevelopment project that threatened Susette Kelo's little pink house.
Meanwhile, Washington, D.C. received $28 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to buy and seize 18 acres of businesses for a private developer to build condos and a new mall. Over the next seven years, affected business owners challenged the District in a dozen different eminent domain cases. But the city won or settled every dispute. Stopping federal funding for these projects could be a potent incentive for local governments to respect Americans' property rights.
To that end, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) has reintroduced the Private Property Rights Protection Act, which was recently passed by the House Judiciary Committee. If the act passes, a state or political subdivision that exercises eminent domain for economic development would be cut off from receiving federal economic grants for two years. The bill still allows cities to address abandoned properties or those that pose an immediate threat to public health and safety. The act would also prohibit the federal government from using eminent domain for economic development. Fighting eminent domain abuse has enjoyed strong bipartisan support: the act originally passed the House 376 – 38, and groups all across the political spectrum have formed broad coalitions. The Private Property Rights Protection Act has been backed by the NAACP, while opposition to eminent domain for private gain has united the Farm Bureau, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the National Federation of Independent Business.
Ending the federal funding of eminent domain abuse is something all Americans can support.

IT IS popular to lament the growing gap between capitalists and workers. In one respect, however, the gap is shrinking: the number of workers who own shares in the business that employs them has never been higher. America leads the way: 32m Americans own stock in their companies through pension and profit-sharing plans, and share-ownership and share-option schemes. The idea continues to gain momentum. Hillary Clinton's recent speeches suggest that they may make it an important plank in their plans to reform capitalism. And worker-capitalists are also on the march in Europe and Asia.
Conservatives like employee ownership because it gives workers a stake in the capitalist system. Left-wingers like it because it gives them a piece of the capitalist pie. And middle-of-the-roaders like it because it helps to close a potentially dangerous gap between capital and labour. David Cameron, Britain's Conservative prime minister, praises John Lewis, a retailer entirely owned by its staff. Bernie Sanders, America's only socialist senator and now a candidate for the Democratic nomination (see Lexington), is a champion of employee share-ownership.

The trend is also being driven by a long-term shift from “defined benefit” (DB) pension plans, in which employers guarantee the retirement income of their workers, to “defined contribution” (DC) schemes, in which workers and employers put money into an investment pot, with no guarantees of how much it will eventually pay out. Including current workers and pensioners there are more than 88m DC plans in existence. A 2013 survey by Aon Hewitt, a consulting firm, found that 14% of such plans' assets were invested in the shares of the employer in question.
A number of studies have found that workers at firms where employees have a significant stake tend to be more productive and innovative, and to have less staff turnover. Employee ownership has its drawbacks, however. One is the risk that workers have too many eggs in one basket: if their employer goes bust they can lose their pensions as well as their jobs. Enron employees were encouraged to stuff their “401(k)” plans (the most popular type of pension scheme) with company stock. Just before the firm went bankrupt in 2001 the average employee held 62% of their or their 401(k) assets in Enron shares. Likewise when Global Crossing went bust a few months later, the collapse in its shares wiped out a large chunk of its workers' pension savings. Despite various initiatives by Congress to stop firms touting their shares to employees, cases are still arising: some former workers at Radio Shack, a retailer that filed for bankruptcy in February, are taking the firm to court, arguing that it kept offering to make its pension contributions in the form of company shares, when it should have known they were going to lose value.
A second problem is entrenchment. Supporters of worker ownership argue that it helps companies take a more long-term perspective. Critics argue that it can entrench bad management and undermine a company's long-term competitiveness: underperforming bosses are much more likely to be able to stay in place, and resist hostile takeovers, if some of the company's shares are in friendly hands. In 1994 United Airlines handed many of its workers a 55% stake, and representation on the board, in return for pay cuts. But its performance remained poor, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2002.
A third risk is entitlement. The strongest argument in favour of employee ownership is that workers will not only toil harder if they get a slice of the profits, but will make sure that their colleagues do so too. A new paper by Benjamin Dunford and others, presented at the Academy of Management's annual meeting in Vancouver, argues that commitment can transmute into entitlement. The academics studied a sample of 409 employees at a commercial-property firm in the Midwest and found that those who invested a higher proportion of their 401(k) accounts in company stock expected better benefits—in the form of promotions and pay rises—than the rest, and took more discretionary leave. (However, the study did not consider whether, nevertheless, employee ownership boosted the firm's overall performance.)
ESOP fables
Arguments about employee ownership can easily become too sweeping: grand claims from supporters invite vigorous rebuttals by critics. A great deal depends on how schemes are structured, and the motives for introducing them. Another recent paper, by Han Kim and Paige Ouimet, of the University of Michigan and University of North Carolina respectively, considers the sizes of ESOPs and of the firms that offer them. They find that small ESOPs (which control a stake of less than 5% in the company in question) are far more likely to boost productivity than large ones, because firms that introduce large ESOPs are often troubled ones trying to conserve cash by substituting shares for pay, or seeking to fend off hostile takeovers by giving shares to friendly insiders. They also argue that ESOPs are much more likely to work in smaller firms than larger ones because employee-owners can more easily monitor each other and thereby boost overall productivity.
There is plenty to be said for employee ownership. It can sharpen workers' motivation and go some way to healing a potentially dangerous divide between the working class and the boss class. But if politicians are serious about the idea, they need to think harder about how to make it work in practice. They should pay closer attention to how schemes are designed, and look for ways to tailor regulations and tax incentives so as to encourage well-designed schemes. They also need to deal with the problem of concentrating risk in a single company's shares. Given that the average life expectancy of Fortune 500 companies has fallen from 75 years in the 1930s to perhaps just 15 years today, encouraging employees to invest their savings with the companies that employ them is a recipe for miserable retirements.

During the opening years of World War II Britain was all that was left against Hitler's military Juggernaut. France had already surrendered and continental Europe was under Germany's control. Hitler, through a massive bombing campaign, hoped to either knock the UK out of the war or destroy its air force in preparation for invasion. The bombing campaign starting in 1940, until Hitler withdrew their planes in preparation for the invasion of the USSR in 1941, was nicknamed the Blitz by the British and was an almost daily aerial bombardment of the United Kingdom. Many iconic photos emerged from the Blitz and the Battle of Britain. The most famous was captured during the December 29, 1940, raid when a Daily Mail reporter snapped what at the time was called the “War's greatest picture.” While this was the most famous, one of the more memorable photos was this Milkman Photo taken by Fred Morley on October 9, 1940, and then published the next day on October 10, 1940.
Staged Image?
October 9th marked the 32nd day of straight bombing raids against the United Kingdom. The nighttime raid of October 9th raid infamously struck the iconic St Paul's Cathedral but luckily the bomb did not detonate. Photographers stationed in London were amazed at the total destruction wrought by German bombers yet their pictures were routinely blocked by the censors who were anxious not to cause a panic. Fred Morley wanting to get some sort of record of the devastation out to the world thought of a situation that the censors would approve. They first found a backdrop of firefighters struggling to contain a fire then they borrowed a milkman's outfit and a craft of bottles. They then got their assistant to pose among the ruins of a city street while the firefighters fought in the background. The photo pushed forward the idea of the stoic British continuing on with their normal lives. The censors felt the same way and it was published the very next day.

BACOLOD CITY—National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) adviser Luis Jalandoni on Saturday said the burial of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos at Libingan ng mga Bayani violated an agreement on human rights and the NDFP would raise this in the next round of formal negotiations.
The NDFP strongly opposed the burial of Marcos that portrayed them as a hero and model, Jalandoni said during a peace forum in Bacolod City.

They said the human rights agreement between the government and the NDFP says that both parties support the inherent and inalienable right of the people to fight tyranny and oppression just as they did in the struggle against the Marcos dictatorship.
They said any move that allows the return of the Marcoses to power, led by the dictator's namesake, former Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, must be condemned by the Filipino people.
“The Filipino people will be very strong in their resistance to such an attempt by the Marcos family and also by supporters and anyone in the (previous) regime,” they said.
The appropriate moves to take regarding Marcos' remains would be tackled during the talks.
In the war on drugs, the NDFP has taken the position that human rights should be respected and ordinary drug users and small time pushers, who actually need rehabilitation, should be given due process, Jalandoni said.
They said the indemnification, reparation and recognition of the rights of the victims of martial law under Marcos are also included in the human rights agreement and there are various ways of doing this.
Jalandoni and their wife, Coni Ledesma, who is part of the NDFP peace panel, are in the country for meetings with the other panel members and the Norwegian facilitator ahead of the third round of talks with government negotiators in Rome next month.
“We have confidence the peace talks will move forward but it will depend a lot on the mass organizations and campaign in support of the people to achieve genuine land reform and national industrialization, as well as the protection of the environment,” they said.
The NDFP is also pushing for national independence and sovereignty. It is seeking the abrogation of the Visiting Forces Agreement and the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the United States in order for the country to exercise an independent foreign policy, they said.

Jalandoni said an independent foreign policy should also uphold in relations with other countries like China and Russia.
“It's good to have foreign relations with other countries like China and Russia, but we must make sure that we assert and protect our own independence and sovereignty and relationships have to be equal and beneficial to both sides,” they said.
“While we develop fruitful relations with China we have to make sure that we do not give up our sovereign rights to the areas that really belongs to the Philippines in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,” they added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz on Wednesday stepped up their criticisms of the U.S. Supreme Court over its recent decisions on gay marriage and Obamacare, saying the rulings were “the very definition of tyranny.”

A member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Cruz held a hearing on “Supreme Court activism” and took aim at Justice Anthony Kennedy.
A regular swing vote on the nine-member court, Kennedy wrote the ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide, in which the court was split 5-4, and joined the majority in a 6-3 ruling upholding tax subsidies that are central to President Barack Obama's healthcare law.
Cruz, a senator from Texas, said at the hearing: “Justice Kennedy's pop psychology has no basis in the text and history of the Constitution.”
The healthcare and gay marriage decisions, issued on successive days in late June, were highly unpopular among the Republican primary voters Cruz is courting in their White House campaign.
Cruz has said states should be allowed to ban same-sex marriage and has repeatedly backed attempts to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.
Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said Cruz and other conservatives were unhappy that the court did not rule the way they hoped in the two cases. Coons noted that liberals, too, have criticized recent court rulings. One, for instance, was the 2010 decision in Citizens United v. FEC, which lifted limits on corporate and union expenditure in federal elections.
After the latest decisions, Cruz called for the justices to face retention elections, similar to those used in some states, whereby justices could be voted out of office. Such a move would require a constitutional amendment.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted after the gay marriage and Obamacare rulings showed that a majority of Americans would support term limits for Supreme Court justices.
Cruz said during the hearing they would also support term limits.
Before they were elected to the Senate in 2012, Cruz was a prominent lawyer who argued nine cases before the Supreme Court.
Cruz is one of 16 candidates in the running to be the Republican nominee in the 2016 presidential election.
On Saturday, the New York Times published an article based on slides obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden as well as interviews with anonymous intelligence officials that alleged the NSA had broken into the servers of Chinese telecom giant Huawei. There, the spy agency obtained sensitive information about the company's routers and switches that served to link its customers to its network. The NSA also monitored the communications of Huawei's executives, the NYT reports.
The US has long had a fraught relationship with Huawei, a company that has maintained that it is independent from the Chinese government and has no ties to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Still, citing national security concerns, US authorities blocked Huawei's purchase of 3Com in 2008, accused it of un-American activities in 2012, and then convinced Sprint and SoftBank to limit their use of Huawei gear in 2013.
The New York Times report said that the 2010 NSA operation, code-named “Shotgiant” (link goes to leaked classified slides), was looking for clues that the giant telecom was working with the PLA.
The report also noted that the US had another strategic interest in its spying:
N.S.A. analysts made clear that they were looking for more than just “signals intelligence” about the company and its connections to Chinese leaders; they wanted to learn how to pierce its systems so that when adversaries and allies bought Huawei equipment, the United States would be plugged into those networks. (The Times withheld technical details of the operation at the request of the Obama administration, which cited national security concerns.) The N.S.A.'s operations against China do not stop at Huawei. Last year, the agency cracked two of China's biggest cellphone networks, allowing it to track strategically important Chinese military units, according to an April 2013 document leaked by Mr. Snowden. Other major targets, the document said, are the locations where the Chinese leadership works. The country's leaders, like everyone else, are constantly upgrading to better, faster Wi-Fi — and the N.S.A. is constantly finding new ways in.
According to Der Spiegel, a German magazine that is also in possession of the same Snowden files as the NYT, “A special unit with the US intelligence agency succeeded in infiltrating Huawei's network and copied a list of 1,400 customers as well as internal documents providing training to engineers on the use of Huwaei products, among other things.”
Following the wildly popular transformation of Gorky Park from rusting funfair to Wi-Fi heaven, Muscovites finally felt as if their city was becoming liveable. But with more gentrifying projects on the cards, is it just a way to silence dissent?

This is Door 19, a pop-up restaurant in a penthouse apartment in Moscow that this year played host to the city's oligarchs and hipsters alike. In case you're interested, and have a spare $18m to blow, the penthouse is for sale, along with several other apartments in the ArtHouse building, for between $15,000 and $20,000 per square metre. Door 19 is both an extravagant plug for the flats but also for a much loftier vision: ArtKvartal, a 510-hectare creative neighbourhood that wouldn't be out of place in London, Berlin or New York.
The plan is an ambitious one, not least because of the hefty investment required to transform the proposed industrial area along the right bank of the Yauza River around Baumanskaya Metro into a neighbourhood with cafes, bars, restaurants and a sense of community – something that Moscow currently lacks.
At its heart is the desire to develop an artistic quarter with work spaces, apartments, pedestrianised lanes and cycle paths that caters to Moscow's growing creative class. The project is still at the design stage and is expected to take between 10 and 15 years to realise, with a model of gentrification that will fan outwards from ArtHouse, taking into its fold other upmarket art clusters such as ArtPlay and Winzavod. Once it is completed, anyone working in the creative industries, from fashion or film, will have the opportunity to rent a place to live or work in.

The man behind ArtKvartal, the “ideologue” as he's known, is Andrey Grinev, co-founder of Citymakers, the urban planning firm that is one-third of the winning consortium to design Zaryadye Park, Moscow's first new public park in 50 years.
Although unwilling to reveal the identity of their investors (“Let's say not just oligarchs”), Grinev, who has a background in real estate development, concedes that their model of turbocharged gentrification is at odds with the usual processes involved.
“What has happened with neighbourhoods like Shoreditch?” they say. “At first the artists came and made the area popular, and then the prices start to rise and they leave and it becomes a bourgeois district like any other. Our plan is to create an area where creative people will stay.”
Grinev, who helped develop Moscow's Ostozhenka district, one of the capital's most exclusive postcodes known as the “Golden Mile”, hopes that with government subsidies ArtKvartal will be able to offer a mix of different rental options. Yet ritzy projects such as Door 19 and ArtHouse as well as another, EMA – a former industrial site that will be given over to artist residencies for a year before being converted into apartments – indicate that the creative label may just be a way to bump up the area's property prices.
ArtKvartal has the backing, albeit only verbally, of three of Moscow city government's most powerful figures: Mayor Sergey Sobyanin, their deputy Marat Khusnullin and the chief architect, Sergey Kuznetsov. While the project lacks a rock solid guarantee, Grinev's commitment to sprucing up the area's interstitial spaces works in their favour. “The development of public spaces remains one of the key priorities of Moscow's urban policy,” says Kuznetsov. “All the new territories which are developing today receive permission only on the condition that the developers pay attention not only to the buildings being created there but also to the space between them.”

Following the wildly popular transformation of Gorky Park, presided over by “Moscow's hipster culture minister” Sergey Kapkov, the renovation of the city's public spaces has become a priority for those in the municipal government. In 2011, the Soviet-era park underwent a multimillion dollar revamp; out went the rusting funfair rides and passed-out drunks and in came ping-pong tables, a contemporary art gallery, free Wi-Fi and a dozen new cafes and bars. For the first time in years, Muscovites felt as if their city was becoming liveable.
Bolstered by the success of the renovation and its corollary – support for the mayor and their ministers – the city government has reapplied this formula to the city's other parks. Not one to miss a trick, in 2012, President Vladimir Putin proclaimed the creation of Zaryadye Park.
A year later the winning consortium headed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the architectural bureau that designed New York's High Line, was announced. Already beset by delays, for now, a question mark hangs over the future of the park. “First of all, politically it's not the greatest time to have an American firm doing something near the Kremlin,” says Oleg Shapiro, co-founder of architectural bureau Wowhaus. “Secondly, what they came up with is really expensive.”
With its emphasis on public spaces, Sobyanin's vision for Moscow stands in contrast to that of their predecessor, the notorious former mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, whose 18-year-rule ended in their disgraceful dismissal in 2010. Although Luzhkov oversaw the oil-fuelled transformation of Moscow from a dreary Soviet capital into a glamorous metropolis with shiny new buildings and roads, change came at the expense of the city's historic architecture, and amid allegations of nepotism and corruption. The upshot was a curtailment of powers associated with the mayoral position; despite this, the Moscow municipal government continues to be a powerful entity in its own right.

“Those who are in charge of the city's development behave differently to the federal government,” says Shapiro. “Moscow is very different to the rest of Russia. It's like a country in a country.”
After designing a slew of contemporary wooden structures in Gorky Park including an open-air cinema, Wowhaus has become the architectural bureau of choice for those in the city government. Most recently, the firm converted a four-lane road on Krymskaya Embankment into a riverside park, featuring wave-shaped benches, fountains and artists' studios.
Obtaining permission and funding for the project was straightforward, says Shapiro. “What's most important is when your ideas somehow coincide with what the power wants,” they say.
VDNKh, a Soviet-era exhibition centre, is the latest public space to get the Gorky Park treatment. The grandiose and rather curious-looking complex, which is larger than Monaco, was built in 1935 for propaganda purposes, with wedding-cake pavilions dedicated to each of the republics of the USSR as well as to Soviet achievements such as electrification.
After years of neglect, this April, VDNKh's new management cleared out the illegal traders and shish-kebab stands and replaced them with chi-chi cafes, landscaped gardens and cycle paths. An aquarium, touted as the largest in Europe, is set to open later this year.
Russia may be is known for its red-tape, but the speed with which the first stage of renovation took place is impressive. “It was built in the 1930s as a symbol of the Soviet empire and now that our government wants to rebuild the empire of course they want their symbols to be restored,” says Shapiro.
Kuba Snopek, a lecturer at the Strelka Institute for Media, Architecture and Design in Moscow, describes the redesign of VDNKh, as a kind of “hipster Stalinism”. “It's strange to have a strong Stalinist space, which is actually fashionable and tries to be very light,” they say. “It's very interesting to see how these spaces are accommodating things which in the west are associated with freedom and liberal tendencies.” Noting the turn towards fixing up public spaces, Snopek says that Russia tends to look towards the west for architectural trends. “But it's always happening with some lag and it always comes up a bit different,” they say.
For Kuznetsov, Moscow's chief architect, VDNKh has a “special aura which must be preserved”. “I would, in fact, not solely link VDNKh with the name of Stalin,” they say. “Rather, it is unique in its encyclopedia of Soviet period architecture and I very much hope that all new facilities being built on VDNKh's territory will be designed and built taking this context into account.”

Many of those involved in the 2011 and 2012 anti-Kremlin protests in Moscow view the transformation of these public spaces into western-style wonderlands as nothing more than a conciliatory move designed to silence dissenting voices.
“The reconstruction of Gorky Park was done just in time to distract people from all the protests, government corruption and stolen votes in the parliamentary election,” says Katerina Shcherbakova, a student at the British Higher School of Art and Design. “After the renovation it became impossible to say that the Department of Culture was corrupt or that our government didn't care about its people, or that it hated the west and wanted a return to the Soviet Union.”
Writing in the London Review of Books, Peter Pomerantsev notes a similarity between the transformation of Moscow and Russia under Catherine the Great. “Catherine bought up some of Europe's best art to create the Hermitage, corresponded with Voltaire, and had Diderot stay at court,” writes Pomerantsev. “But when Enlightenment ideas started to be expressed in real politics, Catherine cracked down.”
Those responsible for designing Moscow, such as Grinev and Shapiro, take a more pragmatic approach. “What should we do?” says Grinev, whose negotiations over ArtKvartal are ongoing. “Fight for them [freedoms]? Leave the country? Or make our lives as beautiful and comfortable as we can and not care about the freedoms we don't have. I prefer the third way.”
THE MAYOR OF London has been criticised for offending the Irish community in remarks they made about a St Patrick's Day celebration in London.
Irish groups in London have said Boris Johnson's remarks were “contemptuous” and belong in the past. However Johnson has refuted the criticisms and said that they “appreciates and admires the Irish”.
In an excerpt from an interview in the New Statesman magazine this week Johnson said:
I'll tell you what makes me angry – lefty crap,” they thunder in response. Like? “Well, like spending £20,000 on a dinner at the Dorchester for Sinn Féin.
Johnson was referring to the St Patrick's Day dinner held by the Irish community in London every year. The annual dinner, which was cancelled by Johnson in 2009, was a self-financing event attended by Irish actors, politicians, communities figures and celebrities, including Bob Geldof, Pauline McLynn and Dermot O'Leary.
A letter in today's Guardian signed by restaurateur Richard Corrigan, actor Adrian Dunbar, Labour party politicians and community activists, said many people “will be disturbed by the mayor of London's contemptuous remarks about a community which has given, and continues to give, so much to our capital city”.
Johnson has dismissed the criticisms. In a statement to TheJournal.ie this afternoon a spokesperson for the Greater London Authority said that the mayor “appreciates and admires the Irish like every other community in this wonderful cosmopolitan capital”.
“The mayor does not believe that they were elected to organise exclusive and expensive dinners at the Dorchester hotel,” said the spokesperson.
“By focusing resources on what really matters to Londoners they have been able to hire more police officers, quadruple rape crisis provision, build an unprecedented number of affordable homes, preside over record investment and cut council tax”.
TTC boss Andy Byford said Tuesday that an "archaic" communication system was a factor in Monday's difficult commute in which a handful of problems caused thousands of transit users to arrive late for work.
In a candid interview with Metro Morning host Matt Galloway, Byford said the TTC uses a text-based system more than 40 years old to stay in touch with streetcar and bus operators.
"It is a system that was state-of-the art in the 1970s, but is now completely obsolescent," said Byford.
"It's basically a text system that you can send text messages to 10 vehicles at a time. You have to wait for them to acknowledge before you can then communicate with the other vehicles. So quite often, ridiculously, the bus and streetcar operators don't know what's going on."
And while the communication system didn't cause Monday's troublesome commute, it did delay getting updated information to operators and passengers. The delays prompted Byford to issue an apology on Monday. They made similar apologies after difficult commutes on weekdays July and March.
Monday's problems included:
A water main break at Yonge and Lawrence caused water to "cascade" onto the platform at Lawrence subway station. This wasn't the TTC's fault but for the entire morning commute, trains rolled through the station but passengers couldn't board or get off there. Instead, the TTC had to operate shuttle buses.
Streetcar derailment, at Russell yard near Greenwood Avenue, possibly caused by ice in the switches, blocked vehicles in the yard, leading to delays on the 510 Spadina route.
A streetcar broke down at at Queen Street and Broadview Avenue, causing delays of up to 90 minutes on both the 501 Queen and 504 King streetcar routes.
A collision involving a streetcar and a vehicle at Dundas and McCaul streets caused more delays.
Subway delays on Bloor-Danforth line.
"I felt I owed people an explanation," said Byford of Monday's commute. "I know it was a very frustrating trip for them."
Byford said the TTC has much work to do when it comes to communicating with passengers when service is interrupted. Some so-called e-alerts failed on Monday and messages sent to subway platform screens aren't seen by many commuters.
Byford said updating the communication system is a priority and he's pushing to have the money added to the TTC's budget
Another problem Byford mentioned is the difficulty getting new parts for old streetcars. Some need to be fashioned by a blacksmith. Ongoing struggles with an outdated signalling system and track in need of replacement are also problems, Byford said.
However Byford also said problematic commutes overshadow positive moves underway to modernize the TTC. They pointed to articulated buses, bigger streetcars and the Presto fare system as examples of upgrades in the works.
"Most days we get it right," Byford said. "Most days most people get to work without incident."
After Gregg Berhalter confirmed reports that the Columbus Crew were interested in German defender Maik Franz on Friday, the Sporting Director and Head Coach said that their team's potential depth in the center of defense could allow the club to use a rarely seen three-centerback, two-wing back system, rather than a traditional flat back four.
"It's interesting," Berhalter told MLSsoccer.com. "We thought of that, actually. To really execute it the right way is difficult, but it's something that interests me."
The Crew traded away Chad Marshall and declined the option for Brazilian defender Gláuber in the offseason, but the club still seems to have a plethora of options in central defense, especially if a move is made for Franz in 2014.
Recently added US international Michael Parkhurst – likely headed for a central role – joins Josh Williams, Tyson Wahl, Eric Gehrig and new Homegrown signing Matt Wiet as center backdepth, along with rightback Chad Barson, who played in the middle during their collegiate career at Akron.
Despite the pieces fitting on paper, Berhalter knows there would be an adjustment period in store throughout the preseason. And while newly acquired Costa Rican Waylon Francis, Agustín Viana and first-round SuperDraft pick Ben Sweat can all play on the left of defense, the right side wing back would be a bit more difficult to nail down.
"It would take a lot of teaching, a lot of instruction and you'd need very fit guys on the outside," they said. "On the left side, I think we have it. On the right side, I think we need to develop that."
Williams, who has been training with some of their Ohio-based teammates in the offseason, was surprised to hear the idea acknowledged as anything other than a crazy thought by one of the players.
"[Berhalter] hasn't talked to us, but some of the guys have actually talked about that," Williams said. "It's weird that you bring that up."
The recently re-signed defender said that the defense's versatility would be the key to pulling off the non-traditional formation.
"There is so much depth back there and so many guys can play different positions," they said. "We're not overly big, but it's kind of an athletic group. We can all kind of be kind of switched around. ... So if that's something [Berhalter] wants to do, we're all in."
Berhalter said that "besides the 3-4-3 or 3-1-4-2" possibility, they have their ideal formation in mind, though they wouldn't share it. But they did comment that looking at how a team like Juventus plays with three central defenders is "remarkable."
"It's tough, because you need a lot of good tactical understanding on the defensive end," they said. "I think that's an interesting route. I'm not sure we're going to go there, but it's something I'm thinking about."
Meet 30-year old Ohio chef Jeremy Pruitt, who's become a Mississippi State internet celebrity because they have the same name as football coach Jeremy Pruitt Brief confusion quickly gave way to a delightful joke and earnest well-wishes.
Jeremy Pruitt is the defensive coordinator for Alabama. He's reportedly emerged as a candidate for Mississippi State's head coaching job, now that Dan Mullen's gone to Florida. Pruitt's Twitter account is @CoachJPruitt, where they have nearly 30,000 followers.
Jeremy Pruitt is not the only Jeremy Pruitt.
Another Jeremy Pruitt is a 30-year-old country club sous chef from Columbus, Ohio, they told SB Nation. They now live in Dayton and is a huge Ohio State fan.  They are not a football coach. Their Twitter account is @jgroove1, where they had just over 500 followers as of 10 p.m. ET Monday.
Here are the two Jeremy Pruitts, just so everyone's clear:
Football coach Jeremy Pruitt (left) and sous chef Jeremy Pruitt (right).
Getty, Jeremy Pruitt
There may have been brief confusion between the two Pruitts on Monday.
Monday evening, a handful of Mississippi State fans started tweeting at Sous Chef Jeremy Pruitt, urging them to come to Starkville.
They were looking for Football Coach Jeremy Pruitt but sent their solicitations to Chef Pruitt instead, or they were just kidding around.
Here's the tweet that started it all, as best I can tell. I think it was unironic, maybe:
Chef Pruitt immediately recognized what was going on.
Chef Pruitt knows football well, so he'd know who Coach Pruitt is anyway. But he's been familiar with Pruitt for years, they told me, because they used to watch that MTV show Two-A-Days.
You remember Two-A-Days, surely. It followed an elite high school football team from Hoover, Ala., in 2006. The defensive coordinator on that team? Coach Jeremy Pruitt. During one episode, Coach Pruitt seemed to have no idea what asparagus was.
There were only a few tweets that seemed to indicate genuine confusion. Even the first account to tweet at Chef Pruitt about the MSU job seemed to get the joke shortly thereafter, so I have no idea how many people were truly confused.
There was one enjoyable exchange between Chef Pruitt, a Bama fan, and Bama beat writer Cecil Hurts of the Tuscaloosa News, who'd retweeted Chef Pruitt's tweet.
And:
Any confusion gave way to this quickly becoming a fun gag.
The first response to Chef Pruitt's note that he'd been getting tweeted at:
Tweets started to pour in from MSU fans all over.
Some invites to the Florida-MSU game next year, when Mullen returns to town:
They got a bunch of offers for MSU gear.
There are scores more tweets like this. At least many dozen, and climbing toward the hundreds as the night got older.
Pretty much everyone except this one guy had a blast with this:
Chef Pruitt was deeply appreciative of all the Starkville love.
They did the only appropriate thing and made this their Twitter bio:
They say MSU will henceforth be a close second behind Ohio State in their heart.
This is now one of my favorite college football stories of the year.
Mississippi State must hire Jeremy Pruitt the Football Coach and also bring in Jeremy Pruitt the Sous Chef as an honorary captain for the first game of the 2018 season.
YOOO LET'S TALK ABOUT CARPET DIEM FOR A MINUTE, SHALL WE? Not only is it a great episode with body switching antics and all that Stanley foreshadowing, but what I love about this episode is how the twins react to getting their bodies switched. With most TV shows, when characters switch bodies they only freak out a tiny bit if at all, mostly reacting like “haha I'm in your body now” or “teehee boobs” (N/A here but you know what I mean). No, the Pines twins literally FREAK THE FUCK OUT. One of them starts VOMITING, the other's rocking in the corner. I've never seen a more realistic reaction to being gender-bent; suddenly your anatomy has changed and everything feels different, you're not yourself, you're literally TRAPPED in someone else's body. I think with all the “fun and playful” body switching TV shows and movies we've seen, we forget how disturbing and ultimately horrific it can actually be–especially being gender-bent.
The Roberts court, which has completed five terms, ruled for business interests 61 percent of the time, compared with 46 percent in the last five years of the court led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist , who died in 2005, and 42 percent by all courts since 1953.
Those differences are statistically significant, the study found. It was prepared by Lee Epstein, a political scientist at Northwestern's law school; William M. Landes, an economist at the University of Chicago; and Judge Richard A. Posner , who serves on the federal appeals court in Chicago and teaches law at the University of Chicago.
The Roberts court's engagement with business issues has risen along with the emergence of a breed of lawyers specializing in Supreme Court advocacy, many of them veterans of the United States solicitor general's office, which represents the federal government in the court.
These specialists have been extraordinarily successful, both in persuading the court to hear business cases and to rule in favor of their clients. The Supreme Court's business docket has stayed active in the current term, which began in October. In a single week this month, the court heard arguments in a case brought by the chamber challenging an Arizona law that imposes penalties on companies that hire illegal workers, and it agreed to hear two cases that could reshape class-action and environmental law.
The chamber had urged the court to hear both cases. It said one of them, an enormous sex-discrimination class-action lawsuit against Wal-Mart , posed “grave risks for American business.” It said the other, a suit by eight states against power companies over carbon dioxide emissions, “has potentially disastrous implications for the U.S. business community.”
The court's docket is studded with other important business cases as well, including ones concerning consumer class-action suits and claims of employment discrimination and securities fraud. The chamber has filed supporting briefs in all of them. In AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, for instance, the chamber urged the court to allow companies to use standard-form contracts that in essence forbid consumers who sign them from pursuing class-action suits. In Thompson v. North American Stainless, the chamber asked the court to forbid some employment discrimination claims, saying that “it costs, on average, over $120,000 just to defend a wrongful-discharge claim.”
Next month, the court will hear arguments in 11 cases. The chamber says it will file briefs in seven of them.

The Chamber's Success
The Chamber of Commerce spent tens of millions of dollars in the recent midterm elections, mostly to help Republican candidates. It says that it has 300,000 members, businesses and organizations “of every size, sector and region,” and that its spending furthered the interests of some three million businesses, most of them small ones.

But the chamber's mission is by no means limited to the elected branches of government. “A central function of the chamber,” it told the Supreme Court in a recent brief, “is to represent the interests of its members in important matters before the courts.”
The vehicle for that is the litigation unit that was envisioned by Mr. Powell, the National Chamber Litigation Center, which says it is “the voice of business in the courts on issues of national concern to the business community.”
Its board includes executives from some of the nation's biggest companies, including Ford , Verizon , Lockheed Martin , Viacom and GlaxoSmithKline .
On the center's 30th anniversary in 2007, Carter G. Phillips, who often represents the chamber and has argued more Supreme Court cases than any active lawyer in private practice, reflected on its influence. “I know from personal experience that the chamber's support carries significant weight with the justices,” they wrote. “Except for the solicitor general representing the United States, no single entity has more influence on what cases the Supreme Court decides and how it decides them than the National Chamber Litigation Center.”
A study prepared by the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal group, examined the center's success rate in the Supreme Court. It found that the positions supported by the chamber prevailed 68 percent of the time in the Roberts court, compared with 56 percent in the last 11 years of the Rehnquist court, a period without changes in the court's membership. Robin S. Conrad, executive vice president of the chamber's litigation unit, said the center's analysis was flattering but superficial, and they questioned its comparisons.
The chamber does not participate in all business cases, they said. The mix of cases before the court has changed over time. And the chamber has become more active. But Ms. Conrad acknowledged their group's exceptional track record. “Why have we been successful?” they asked. “I'd like to think it's because of the quality of the arguments and the briefs we present to the court.”
“The court is looking for reliable voices to confirm its decisions, and I'd like to think it's looking to the chamber because it tells a straight story, and we try not to be shrill or ideological,” Ms. Conrad said. “The chamber has earned a reputation for being a credible voice of business.”

Doug Kendall, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, drew a different conclusion, saying the numbers proved that the Roberts court increasingly sided with corporate interests. They also said the study documented “a sharp ideological divide that did not exist before 2005.” In the last 11 terms of the Rehnquist court, the five more conservative justices voted for the chamber's position 61 percent of the time, while the four more liberal justices voted for it 48 percent of the time.
In the first five terms of the Roberts court, the corresponding bloc of five more conservative justices voted for the chamber's position 74 percent of the time, and the four more liberal justices 43 percent of the time.
But counting votes is not the same thing as assessing results, Ms. Conrad said. “Our research has shown that the vast majority of business decisions are decided by a lopsided majority of 7 to 2 or more,” they said.
Over the Roberts court's first five terms, Ms. Conrad said, only 10 percent of the business docket was decided by the classic 5-to-4 split, with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joining the court's four more conservative members in the majority.

The idea that the Supreme Court reflexively rules for the chamber and other business interests is too simplistic, many legal scholars and practitioners say. If the court favors business, they say, it is as part of a broader orientation toward free markets and a wariness of many kinds of lawsuits.
“The Roberts court appears to be a mainstream, traditional, modern Republican, conservative court,” said Bradley W. Joondeph, a law professor at Santa Clara University and a former law clerk to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor . “Part of its constellation of commitments is against the regulation of business and, in particular, the regulation of business through litigation.”
A prominent Supreme Court advocate who often represents businesses, Maureen E. Mahoney, chose their words carefully when asked at a chamber news briefing in September whether the Roberts court was especially receptive to the kinds of arguments pressed by corporations.

“The best court for getting a fair hearing on those issues,” they said, “is the Supreme Court.”
Government Experience
An additional explanation for the recent successes of business interests in the Supreme Court may lie in the rise of specialized practice groups at major law firms led by veterans of the solicitor general's office.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Turning service as the United States solicitor general into a career at a commercial firm is a relatively new phenomenon, according to a recent article by Matthew L. Sundquist in The Charleston Law Review.
From 1952 to 1981, they wrote, former solicitors general usually became judges, joined law schools or worked as public servants. In the next 15 years, they split their time between academic and legal work, often consulting with law firms with specialized Supreme Court practices.
Starting in 1996, every former solicitor general, with one exception, has gone on to supervise a Supreme Court practice at a major law firm, earning as much as $5 million a year. The exception is Justice Elena Kagan , who joined the court in August.
These specialists make their livings representing business interests, and they have used the skills they honed in government service to achieve notable successes in the Supreme Court. They had a particularly good run, for instance, in environmental cases in the term that ended in 2009.
“For the first time, a series of industry clients last term turned repeatedly to the expert Supreme Court bar for assistance in a host of cases arising under federal pollution control laws,” Richard J. Lazarus, a law professor at Georgetown, wrote in The Yale Law Journal Online last February. “The result was palpable and formed the basis of the best term that industry has ever enjoyed before the court in environmental cases.”
Among these lawyers were some of the most prominent members of the specialized Supreme Court bar. Though the odds of obtaining Supreme Court review are about one in 100, these lawyers persuaded the court to hear four cases that “would not have seemed to have a remote chance of review,” Professor Lazarus wrote. They won every time.
In one of the cases, Theodore B. Olson , who had served as solicitor general in the administration of President George W. Bush , persuaded the court not only to hear the case but also to rule for their client, making it easier to dump mining waste into an Alaskan lake.

In another big environmental case, Miguel A. Estrada, also a veteran of the solicitor general's office, persuaded the Supreme Court not to hear a case, though the lower courts were split on the question it presented and the federal government had implored the justices to resolve it.

Mr. Estrada's client, McWane Inc., a pipe manufacturer in Alabama , had been convicted of discharging untreated industrial pollutants into a creek. An appeals court threw out the conviction and a $5 million fine, saying the creek was not covered by the Clean Water Act. Mr. Estrada's skill in persuading the court to let that decision stand was the term's coup de grâce, Professor Lazarus wrote.
But a broader look at the Roberts court's environmental cases by Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, found no pro-business trend. “The Roberts court's environmental decisions issued to date suggest neither a disposition toward business nor a hostility toward environmental regulation,” Professor Adler wrote in their article, published last year in The Santa Clara Law Review. “The ‘pro-business' position has prevailed in some cases, and lost in others. If the relative magnitude of the cases is taken into account, it is even more difficult to argue that the Roberts court has been ‘pro-business' in this area.”
There has been less dispute about the victories business groups have recently enjoyed in other areas of the law.
David L. Franklin, a law professor at DePaul University , wrote in another article in The Santa Clara Law Review last year that the chamber had been quite successful in the Roberts court in four of what they considered five main categories of cases — punitive damages, arbitration of consumer and other disputes, the standards for early dismissal of lawsuits, and federal pre-emption of state laws governing injury and other suits. The “conspicuous exception,” they said, was employment discrimination.
The numbers support Professor Franklin's conclusions, but they are small and not statistically significant.
Even in employment discrimination cases, however, the available numbers are subject to two interpretations. True, the Roberts court's 16 decisions have been evenly divided, according to an analysis by Professor Epstein at Northwestern. But the Rehnquist court ruled in favor of people claiming discrimination more often — 64 percent of the time.
All of this is to say that determining whether the Supreme Court is “pro-business” or “anti-business” can be difficult. There will always be exceptions.
“The story of a conservative, activist, pro-corporatist Roberts court may sound compelling at first blush, particularly with its repetition and regrettable distortion of the cases involved, but it is just a story — and a fictional one at that,” Robert Alt, a lawyer with the Heritage Foundation , a conservative group, testified at Justice Kagan's confirmation hearings last summer.

They listed several major cases in which the Roberts court had ruled against business interests, including a drugmaker and a tobacco company. They also noted that some of the court's more important pro-business cases, including ones casting doubt on the conviction of an Enron executive and cutting the punitive damages in the Exxon Valdez oil spill , were written by liberal justices.
It is clear, though, that the Supreme Court these days is increasingly focused on business issues. “The fraction of business cases on the docket has grown from 21 percent in the last five years of the Rehnquist court to 27 percent during the Roberts years,” Professor Epstein said. “This isn't a small jump.”
Ms. Conrad, of the chamber, said part of their group's role was to keep its agenda before a court that is deciding about half as many cases as it did in the 1980s.
One way to do that, they said, is by filing briefs urging the court to hear particular cases, an effort that is ordinarily a 1-in-100 long shot. But the chamber has succeeded about 30 percent of the time in persuading the Roberts court to take its cases, Ms. Conrad said.
(A.k.a. “Irregular Jelly Beans”.)
This little (4.7-ounce) bag of Jelly Belly jelly beans caught my eye the last time I was in a Dollar Tree store. I wanted to pick up something that the gummi-loving Donald might also enjoy, and while jelly beans aren't gummis, they are at least related.
Besides, I was curious; I'm not generally a huge jelly bean fan, but of course I'd heard of Jelly Belly– the “gourmet” jelly bean. For a dollar, why not?
The bag is very colorful, featuring the Jelly Belly jelly bean mascot doing a, well, a belly flop into a heap of deformed jelly beans. (No wonder it grabbed my attention.)
If the name of the candy isn't clear enough, turn the bag over. From the text on the back, we learn the following:
“They aren't available very often, but when they are… Jelly Belly fans love to snap up our famous BELLY FLOPS. These special beans taste great, but don't quite meet all of our demanding standards for size, color, shape and flavor.”
Hm…
Interesting.
You tear open the bag, pour a few out into a dish… and yes, there are a few oddly-shaped beans. Mostly they're just two beans– always of the same flavor– that got stuck together. (Siamese beans, if you will.)
However, that leaves you wondering about all those other beans. The ones that look pretty normal from the outside. Are they the ones that didn't meet Jelly Belly's “demanding standards” in the flavor department?
We're not sure what was wrong with them (very slightly not the right shape/size?), but they tasted fine to us.
None of the beans had the Jelly Belly “stamp”. I guess that's some sort of stamp of approval that comes after the rigorous sorting process. (I wonder if there are specially trained people at the Jelly Belly Factory who pick out the inferior beans or if it's all automated…)
One downside of Jelly Belly beans– flops or not– seems to be the very thing that sets them apart. That would be the range of flavors. When you have so many flavors, there are sure to be hits and misses. Donald hates the coconut. I'm not especially fond of cinnamon-flavored beans. Neither of us cared much for the ones that tasted like buttered popcorn. (Blech! But then again, neither of us like movie popcorn with that heavy butter. If you love buttery movie popcorn, this might be a dream come true for you.)
Also, it can be difficult (especially for the uninitiated) to tell what flavor a bean is before eating it. I thought I was getting cherry (one of my favorites), but it turned out to be the dreaded cinnamon. I chomped down on a yellow-green bean, expecting sour apple, and was startled by lime. I don't even dislike lime– but when you're expecting apple and get lime, it's not necessarily a pleasant surprise.
That said, our little bag had a decent assortment of flavors. If you buy them in person, you can peek through the clear window in the bag to make sure you're not getting tons of licorice, for instance. (Unless you're one of those weirdos who actually like licorice, that is.)
So, my verdict? I thought they were alright, but since I'm not a serious jelly bean lover, I'd probably rather spend my money and calories on something different, next time, now that my curiosity's been sated. However, for someone who's partial to very flavorful jelly beans– particularly the Jelly Belly brand beans– these Belly Flops are a good deal. (They're also gluten-free and made in a peanut-free facility!)
deadmau5 plays a set before Marshmello, drops Maceo Plex and gets flamed for a ‘boring' set
Marshmello fans are roasting deadmau5 for what they claim was a boring performance at Decadence in Arizona. The two helmeted producers have a long history of controversy and Twitter beefs so when the festival announced that Joel was in the timeslot just before Marshmello it was almost certain that there would be some sort of fallout.
As reported by the Toronto Rave Community and first-hand accounts on reddit, audience members were thrown off by Joel's decision to play their deeper catalog rather than their more popular and commercial productions. Immediately following Porter Robinson's set, deadmau5 turned things towards the underground, opening with their own “Imaginary Friends” into Raxon's remix of Noir & Olivier Giacomotto's “Reste.” While many die hard deadmau5 fans in attendance were likely enthralled by a “Techmau5” performance, the EDMers awaiting Marshmello's set flamed Joel on Twitter, claiming their set was “terrible” and “75 minutes of bullshit.”
The “boring” music in question was likely Maceo Plex's hit “Solar Detroit” — one of 2015's best techno productions, and Jay Lumen's “London.” The response on Twitter makes it clear that what we are dealing with here isn't an instance of deadmau5 trolling the audience, but rather a complete lack of music appreciation from Marshmello fans who don't have a nuanced ear and prefer sick drops and Lil Yachty acapellas.
God forbid someone plays something different for once.

MN high school grad rate tops 80 percent; students of color still lag
Mounds View commencement Tom Weber | MPR News 2010
Minnesota students from all groups showed better high school graduation rates, the Education Department said Tuesday. Still, deep gaps remain between whites and black, Native American and Latino students.
Overall the high school graduation rate came in at about 81 percent last year with gains in every student group.
The data show continued growth in the number of students finishing high school, the Minnesota Department of Education said as it released the data.
"Over the past four years, we have doubled down on our efforts to better support students on their path from K-12 to career and college, and these data show it is working," Commissioner Brenda Cassellius said in a statement. "While today's data show Minnesota is moving in the right direction, there is more work to do."
In a conference call with reporters, Cassellius said because of increases in on-time graduation rates in recent years, disparities have begun to narrow between students of color and white students.
The head of the statewide teachers union congratulated students, teachers and policymakers for the role they played in pushing graduation rates upward.
Denise Specht, the president of Education Minnesota, said it's progress that's closing the achievement gap.
"There's still much more to do, but we're slowly closing gaps by race and poverty and for English learners," Specht said. "The trends are good."
While the data show improvements, wide gaps remained between student groups. Among the results, here are the 2014 graduation rates by group:
• White students, 86 percent
• Asian-American students, 82 percent
• Black students, 60 percent
• Native American students, 51 percent
• Students learning English, 64 percent
• Students from low-income families, 66 percent
• Latino students, 63 percent
The four-year rate for Native American students increased slightly, just over one percent from 2013.
On-time graduation rates for Minnesota Native American students have ranked at the bottom when compared to other states in recent years.
In fact federal data show Minnesota has the worst or second-worst graduation rates among reporting states in all four non-white student categories. No other state is in the bottom five in all four groups, and only Oregon comes close with three races in the bottom five.
One approach to fixing low graduation rates, according to Daniel Sellers at the education reform group MinnCan, is to make school more culturally relevant for students of color.
To do that Sellers thinks the state should concentrate on hiring a more diverse teacher workforce.
Students of color make up 28 percent of the state's enrollment, but only four percent of the state's teachers are non-white.
"It's critical when you understand that as the student population gets more and more diverse, seeing somebody that reflects them at the head of the classroom is one important way to meet the needs of students," Sellers said.
The key to fixing the graduation gap lies in finding programs within districts that are having success and replicating them across the state.
"This isn't all bad news, in fact there's some real good news in this," said former Minneapolis mayor R.T. Rybak, executive director of Generation Next, a group focusing on the achievement gap. "The challenge we have is to try and take these bright spots and bring them to as many schools as possible and quickly."
Meanwhile state education officials credit the slow and steady overall rise in graduation rates to tougher math and reading requirements put in place for students in recent years. They added that the 2014 data moves Minnesota closer to a statewide goal of having a 90 percent graduation rate by 2020.

Put simply, ChocolateConstruction is the wonderfully-wild combination of a building toy and a confectionery tool. Put a bit more extravagantly, ChocolateConstruction allows YOU to become a Chocolate Paleontologist - or "Chocologist" - by helping you create perfect, notched, interlocking, chocolate pieces which when built together, form an absolutely amazing 6-inch tall CHOCOLATE T. rex!
Physically, ChocolateConstruction is a patent-pending, durable yet stylized silicone mold featuring nine cavities for the various bones which will make up your chocolate T. rex. You'll find a ferocious skull with shocking sharp teeth, a long, curving spine, various sizes of ribs, and many more!
Shown below, each piece is "notched" with a rectangular slot. When these notches are connected to their matching slots, your vicious and delicious T. rex will be born!
For ease of construction, beside each notch in the mold is a raised number which corresponds to a second notch with the same number. And so building your T. rex is as simple as matching the numbers - which makes it dangerously easy to give rise to a whole herd of chocolaty beasts! And because the mold is made of food-safe silicone, you're free to devour as many T. rex as you'd like!
ChocolateConstruction is the new pinnacle of the food-building arts - and it's available now! Chocologists the world over, rejoice!
Or shudder in delicious terror...
As most should be aware, our friend the Tyrannosaurus rex makes everything better! So 'why a T. rex?' really is a question that should never, ever be asked in life. As per the golden rule, if you can fit a T. rex into what you're doing, you fit it in - end of story. And chocolate is no exception!
But seriously, which king of beasts is more recognizable, more daunting, and more deserving of adoration than the T. rex? Lion's come close, but they're simply too fluffy and cute for this chocolaty construction project.
So for this first edition of ChocolateConstruction, we had to choose the crowd favorite. Anyone who's built wooden 3D models has most likely come across the T. rex model, so we knew it would have a far reach in the building community - and due to its flair and style, a large reach in the chocolate community as well!
Paleontologists take ages carefully excavating (what used to be) bones from the rock - chipping and brushing away tiny fragments little by little.
But we don't have ages - we want a chocolate dinosaur right now. And so we've expedited the process!
Thanks to ChocolateConstruction, the wonderful and exciting process has been shortened to mere minutes - producing a perfect dino exactly when you want it!
To bring forth the regal and towering cocoa beast, Chocologists need only remember five simple steps:
Find a nice bowl for your chocolate - this is the start of your T. rex!
Melt the chocolate in a microwave until smooth.
Fill the various parts of the mold, letting the chocolate flow into all the bony nooks and crannies!
Let the chocolate cool for about 5 minutes or until hard.
Carefully bend the mold back and pull the bones from the "ground"!
It's time to build! Start by connecting both leg bones to the hip bone.
Then connect the large head/spine piece to the hips/legs combo.
Lastly, connect the 3 ribs and both arms to the spine to finish!
And then of course the optional - but often inevitable - sixth step:
Oh how the mighty have fallen...
Take a spin with our 3D model of ChocolateConstruction! Click and drag, scroll with the mouse wheel, and click on the numbered annotations to check it all out!
Looking to study Chocology a bit more in-depth? Hungry for a few more photos? Feast your eyes!
Notice the medium rib with notches to hold the arms!
Extra thick legs to hold the weight of the lumbering T. rex!
And a beautifully-sloping tail completes the tripod shape, holding your chocolate dino up!
Strong, ferocious, and delicious!
Try out other kinds of chocolate too - how about a white chocolate T. rex!
Ahhh! A delectable herd's forming!
What's all this "+1 Vote!" stuff? Well that's another aspect that makes ChocolateConstruction so great! While the T. rex is phenomenal and absolutely ground-breaking, he's only the start! We have a huge amount of new designs on our minds for the future. And we've decided to bring the community together to help decide which we produce next.
So all backers who pledge at the $40 level or higher will also receive "One Vote". Some time after this campaign ends and all backers have received their molds and eaten their fill of the chocolate T. rex, we'll begin working on the next set of designs. We'll choose 3-5 of our favorites and finally bring them to you! Through an online voting system, backers will then be able to cast their votes to choose the next design we produce! Will the choice be between a Triceratops, Rocket ship, and Bulldozer? Will it be between a super-cute Corgi, a devious Devil, and a sky-scraping Skyscraper? Who knows! But one thing's certain... If you have a 'vote', you will decide!
When designing both the dinosaur mold and this campaign, we took a serious look at how we wanted to handle Stretch Goals. We've all seen so many wonderful-looking projects in the past get bogged down and ultimately ruined by heaps and heaps of stretch goals. While exciting in idea, these stretch goals add to the complexity of the project and tend to detract from the product's core concept. And in the worst situations we saw, the product was ultimately ruined by trying to cram too many extras into the "base" model.
And so ChocolateConstruction won't be going down that path! We chose to perfect the original product and raise it to the height of quality that we wanted for our fellow Chocologists - instead of trying to make it better through stretch goals later on.
And so we're offering JUST ONE STRETCH GOAL!
Available colors will be determined as we near each goal - taking into account what you backers say you want. So leave a comment and tell us what color you'd like to see next!
1) Get Chocolate Dinosaurs Out There!
An obvious point - but important nonetheless! Backing this campaign brings the mold to life - which then of course gives rise to the cocoa-y herd! We could all use more crazy 'eats' in our lives!
2) Influence Future Creations!
By backing this campaign, YOU have the power to not only make this a reality, but also help choose what types of dinos or other designs we make next! Through the pledge levels, backers have the ability to vote on future models. Want to build a chocolate skyscraper? Or a chocolate tank? Or perhaps just more dinosaurs like a chocolate Triceratops? By backing this campaign, the choice becomes yours!
3) Discounts!
ChocolateConstruction is available through this campaign for 25% off of the future MSRP! So get in now while the gettin's good and start building your prehistoric dessert before anyone else - and for a cheaper price!
We wish we could tell you some great, epic origin story for ChocolateConstruction. But we don't have some tale of wandering through the wilderness on a soul-searching quest for the next great invention of our time...
In realty, ChocolateConstruction came about from the simple love of something new to tinker with, something new to build, and something new to eat! Because that's what we are - builders, model-makers, tinkerers, and food lovers. That's not to say we were sick of the offerings in the building-toy market - quite the opposite, as we've grown up with K'NEX, LEGO, and the flimsy-but-fun balsa wood models. And we still buy and build those today. But after years of the same, we HUNGERED for more...
And so we set out to create something eye-catchingly new, yet relatable. And of course something crazily-fun, yet super accessible - with an incredibly wide appeal to spawn a huge audience of fans and an absolutely wonderful community around what's fun and exciting.
So we combined our interests and what we loved. And who doesn't love to build? Who doesn't love dinosaurs? And who doesn't love to eat chocolate!?
The idea thought and the journey begun, we set to work designing the first dinosaur for our first mold.
It was a long and messy process as we worked through various designs, tweaking and re-tweaking, leaving in our wake piles upon piles of broken bones (chocolate bones, that is).
A dinosaur graveyard...
And after an incredible amount of trial and error, doodles, sketches, and build attempts, we perfected the design, had a steel production mold made, and we were off!
From steel comes silicone! And from silicone comes dinosaurs!
We had to test and choose multiple types of mold materials, different kinds of finishes for the mold, etc. We also worked at length to secure a strong and defensible patent to protect our idea and enable us to supply the world with the highest quality building molds for years to come!
And finally, when all else was perfected, and with our inventive (and messy) journey coming to a close, all that was left to do was to choose the final color of the mold.
ChocolateConstruction is ready. And we know you are too!
There's so little left to do! And we really do mean that.
We've chosen our manufacturer. We've already paid for and built the steel molds which will produce our silicone molds. Our packaging is fully designed and waiting to be printed. Our shipping platform and shipping supplies are already in place and sourced.
All that's left to do is send the full payment to begin the production run.
Because all of the prep work is already complete, our production and fulfillment can happen very quickly - immediately after the successful funding of this campaign! And this means that backers will receive their ChocolateConstruction molds before the holidays - give the gift of delicious dinosaurs!
To get a bit more specific, a timeline of the quick turnaround with detailed dates is below:
As for our budget, you'll see a detailed pie chart below showing the various costs associated with this project and with bringing ChocolateConstruction to you!
The world.
Well, a bunch of different parts of the world, to be specific. We've done the grueling work and so we now have a patent-pending status for a: "Reusable silicone chocolate mold used to produce interlocking building pieces to construct edible models". Meaning, because we developed and invented this product, we're the only ones who can legally make chocolate molds used to build these crazy edible models. And because of this protection, we'll be running unopposed, which will allow us to focus on designing new models and bring you Chocologists new and ever-wilder molds very quickly. We're starting out (somewhat) small right now, just to share with the world who we are, but we're ready to go big! We're talking bulldozers, spaceships, tanks, elephants, dragons, trees, planets, and many, many more - and of course, more dinosaurs! And all out of chocolate!
So stay tuned!
We are WilderWares - a small group of inventors, and of course, chocolate and dinosaur lovers!
We were raised on Legos, K'NEX, and balsa wood models. We've also always been bakers, chocolatiers, and fans of good (and fun!) food. And so when we had exhausted all building sets and conventional uses for chocolate, we had to create something new - but from something that was already quite familiar. The resulting marriage of the notched balsa wood model and chocolate molds became exactly what we had been looking for!
We created ChocolateConstruction to offer other like-minded people the best of both worlds. And to bring those best parts to the world, we've come to Kickstarter - and to you!
So thanks for joining us, and we're incredibly happy and excited to have you along for the ride!

War against ISIS/Daesh: Turkish Army assisted Daesh in crossing the border disguised as YPG forces – Updated (Kurdistan)
Updated: Today, in Kobane, at least 50 people [now known to be over 200] have been killed by Daesh terrorists, who attacked with 3 suicide car bombs, with one from the Turkish border at Kobane's Mursitpinar border gate. Kobane hospital is currently unable to treat the injured all at once, for those with critical condition are attempted to be moved to North Kurdistan, Turkey. But Turkish military on the borderline are preventing the process of transferring the injured who most of them are women and children. Despite learning how serious situation of the wounded are, the Turkish military and their border officials are not responding consciously and they continue to keep the civilians waiting near the border crossing.
The ISIS terrorists have at 4 o'clock in the morning with the help of Turkish soldiers crossed the border. The ISIS terrorists were wearing the uniforms of YPG. So far 7 dead and 50 injured there. Our people need urgent help. All Kurds in Northern Kurdistan from Pirsus city (Suruç), please go to hospital, people in urgent need of blood ASAP!!!!! Please note all civilian people from Kobanê, please remain calm and don't leave your homes!!!! In the center of Kobanê so far 10 people have died. In Berxbatan village are very heavy fighting between YPG fighters and terrorists of ISIS. It is difficult to know how many civilians have been killed in Berxbatan village [23 are reported dead so far]. Nobody from YPG was able to connect to the internet today because the Turkish telefon company “Tukcell” has been crippled.

A group of Daesh (ISIS) terrorists who waged an attack on Kobane city this morning June 25, were repulsed by our forces of the People's/Women's Defense Units in an appropriate reaction to their quick and simultaneous assaults. During intense fighting near the city's border gate at least 15 attackers have been confirmed killed, while a member of the terrorists has been captured alive.
For now, clashes continue within an extent where the terrorists encounter a total blockade by the Defense Units.

1993-94 • The Minnesota North Stars move to Dallas, becoming the Dallas Stars. Even though the Twin Cities eventually got a replacement franchise with the Minnesota Wild, former owner Norm Green is still persona non grata in the region to this day. • The NHL welcomes two new teams -- the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and the Florida Panthers. • The divisions undergo a slight realignment, and their names are changed to reflect geographical locations. Gone are Patrick, Adams, Norris and Smythe -- in their places go Northeast, Atlantic, Central and Pacific. Furthermore, the Wales Conference becomes the Eastern Conference, and the Campbell Conference becomes the Western Conference. The winners of the conference finals still receive the Prince of Wales Trophy and the Campbell Bowl, respectively. • On March 23, Wayne Gretzky scores their 802nd career goal, surpassing Gordie Howe as the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Luc Robitaille and Marty McSorley assisted on the goal, which came against Kirk McLean and the Vancouver Canucks. • The playoff format is changed. Teams are now seeded in relation to their conference standing as opposed to their divisional standing, with the top eight teams per conference gaining playoff berths. The division winners are given the top seeds, and the non-winners are seeded according to their regular season records. • The New York Rangers end a 54-year Stanley Cup drought, outlasting the Vancouver Canucks in seven games to win their first Stanley Cup since 1940. At the end of the seventh game at Madison Square Garden, one fan holds up a sign that reads, "Now I can die in peace." The Rangers' win leaves the Detroit Red Wings as the team with the longest Stanley Cup drought.
