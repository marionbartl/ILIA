For the third time this year, an Indigenous community in northwestern Ontario is mourning over the suicide of a 12-year-old girl.Jenera Roundsky was found dead Tuesday at the local hockey rink in Wapekeka, less than six months after the community lost Jolynn Winter and her friend Chantell Fox, who died by suicide two days apart.The three girls were all part of a suicide pact, the community says.“We are deeply saddened to learn of ‎the tragic suicide of a young person at Wapekeka First Nation last night,” said Trell Huether, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Children and Youth Services, in a statement released Wednesday evening.“We are keeping the family and loved ones in our thoughts.”Article Continued BelowWapekeka is a community of almost 400 people located about 450 kilometres northeast of Sioux Lookout.The ministry is working closely with Nishnawbe Aski Nation and others to provide support to the community, Huether said.“Working with our Indigenous partners, we are committed to reducing the high rate of suicide among Indigenous youth through systems changes that are culturally-appropriate, focused on prevention and access to appropriate interventions and mental health supports as close to home as possible.”
Many indigenous cultures have used herbs and plants in therapeutic capacities to address health issues. This is a tradition and practice that extends to nearly every continent and includes nearly every culture and gives new meaning to “living off the land.” Fortunately, in spite of the advertising and brainwashing initiatives by the pharmaceutical industry, this habit has also taken root in America and over half the population uses some form of herbal therapy. Do you favor herbal remedies and suffer from poor circulation or other vascular conditions? You may be interested to learn about horse chestnut, or aesculus hippocastanum, a tree which contains compounds that may offer relief.
What is Horse Chestnut?
Horse chestnut is a tree native to the Balkan Peninsula but found throughout the northern hemisphere. Horse chestnut seeds, leaves, bark, and flowers have been used for centuries to help relieve an array of health problems. Horse chestnut seed has a place in European phytotherapy and is used to address vascular issues. A tea made from horse chestnut is a staple of Turkish folk medicine and used to relieve an upset stomach and pass kidney stones; they also use the seeds to alleviate hemorrhoid symptoms. [1] Today, horse chestnut is primarily used as a traditional remedy for vascular problems like chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, a condition in which the veins do not efficiently return blood from the legs to the heart.
Why is Horse Chestnut Effective?
Horse chestnut contains a compound called aescin which has several observed prospective benefits. Research out of China suggests that aescin is resistant to systemic redness. It's not uncommon for some compounds to temper redness by suppressing the immune system, since it can be a response from the immune system. Aescin resists redness and swelling without being immunosuppressive. [2] Aescin has also exhibited very strong antioxidant activity. Middlesex University in England published information that showed horse chestnut extract to be one of the most effective free radical fighters available. Additionally, Aescin is also a saponin, which is a word you may have heard before in conjunction with natural soap products. More than providing a natural clean, saponins also help the vascular system by making capillaries less fragile. This is likely to be of tremendous interest to persons who experience the swelling that results when fragile capillaries leak fluid. [3]
Horse Chestnut and Vein Health
CVI is a condition in which ill-functioning valves prevent blood from efficiently circulating away from the extremities. There are different causes of CVI but the most common include deep vein thrombosis and obesity. CVI is often identifiable by itchiness, increased leg pigmentation, swelling, varicose veins, and even ulcers. The most common treatment is to wear compression socks. Made of a tight elastic, compression socks do exactly as their name implies, they compress the veins and arteries which decreases the size of distended veins. This increases pressure on the arteries and forces more blood to circulate. All this allows less blood to pool in the feet and legs.
Studies have shown that horse chestnut extract provides a similar effect to compression socks and helps to contract veins and arteries. [4] According to the Journal of the Norwegian Medical Association, horse chestnut seed extract is widely used throughout Europe for chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). [5] Italy's University of Milano performed research that showed aescin to be as effective as compression therapy for CVI and, additionally, aescin is significant for not just CVI, but also hemorrhoids and edema. [6] Why? At the lowest level, horse chestnut seed extract is thought to inhibit the breakdown of capillary wall proteins. [7]
Horse Chestnut Research
The Institute of Medical Biometry and Medical Informatics at Germany's University of Exeter reviewed available information and found that while traditional CVI treatment consists of compression therapy, compression therapy can be painful and susceptible to compliance issues. In these instances, oral medications may provide the most promising outlook and the positivity of that scenario increases when the medications are from natural, plant sources like horse chestnut. In their review, researchers were quick to note that the symptoms of CVI improved when an extract of horse chestnut was used. [8]
Another German study involved 22 patients with CVI who were given capsules with either an aescin extract or a placebo. Those who took the asescin extract noted a “compression like” effect in the form of decreased intravascular volume; supporting the argument for horse chestnut's benefit for venous problems in the legs. [9]
The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center evaluated various approaches to dealing with vein and circulation problems. Compression therapy and topical creams have been shown to reduce pain and swelling but their long term application and benefit is questionable. Obviously, the best long term solution is to address potential causes at the root, especially if obesity or type 2 diabetes are a factor. Absent that, researchers noted that herbal supplements like horse chestnut may have much to offer for improving symptoms of CVI. [10]
Supplementing with Horse Chestnut
The research into horse chestnut benefits has, fortunately, observed very few adverse side effects. To the contrary, horse chestnut is thought to be remarkably safe and well tolerated by most people. Some research has shown that aescin is more absorbable by the body during the daytime than night- something to consider if you supplement with horse chestnut. [11]
If circulation and vein health are a concern in your life, I encourage you to take inventory of yourself and determine if there are any factors you can change to get those issues under better control. Are you eating healthy? Are you exercising enough? Would losing a few pounds put you in a better spot? When was the last time you cleansed your body? Sometimes those are factors, sometimes they're not. Regardless, if lifestyle choices aren't putting you where you want to be, Hematrex® contains organic horse chestnut and is the only vein and circulatory support supplement I recommend.

Michelin Helps The Top-Two Protagonists Produce A Great Battle As Records Tumble
Posted by: newsla on Aug 14, 2017 - 06:45 AM Michelin Help The Top-Two Protagonists Produce A Great Battle As Records Tumble
Michelin witnessed its full range of MotoGP slick compound tyres used today during the NeroGiardini Motorrad Grand Prix von Österreich at the Red Bull Ring in Austria and a straight fight at the end between two great rivals before Andrea Dovizioso (Ducati Team) came out the victor.
All six MICHELIN Power Slick race tyres were chosen by the 24-racers that lined up on todays grid, with different pairings being used as the riders looked for the optimum performance from a range of tyres that gave many options over the weekend. Pole-setter Marc Marquez (Repsol Honda Team) went with the medium front and hard rear pairing, whilst the early race leader Jorge Lorenzo (Ducati Team) chose the medium front and soft rear option. Lorenzo got the hole-shot and led for the first 11-circulations of the 28-lap race around the 4,318m Austrian circuit, before Marquez took the lead on lap-12. The reigning champion tried to make a break, but was followed closely by Dovizioso, who was using the medium front and soft rear combination on his Ducati.
Watched at trackside by 90,411 fans, the two combatants then produced an incredible last few laps as they changed places numerous times. Dani Pedrosa (Repsol Honda Team) briefly joined in the fight at the front, but was unable to stay with Dovizioso and Marquez as the race continued, leaving the championship contenders to battle it out at the front. The two had different tyre compound choices from either end of the spectrum on the rear of their respective bikes, but grip, performance and durability never looked an issue for either man as they started the last-lap. Dovizioso led as the race approached the last corner, but Marquez made an audacious and exciting attempt to pass, using all the grip he could find and as much of the track as he could use, but he just couldnt get the better of the Italian and Dovizioso crossed the line a mere one-tenth-of-a-second ahead of his rival  setting a new race duration record in the process. Marquezs second place strengthened his championship lead, with Dovizioso now his closest rival, just 16-points behind.
Pedrosa, using the medium front and hard rear compound pairing crossed the line in third, with Lorenzo taking fourth. Fifth position and the title of First Independent Rider was taken by Johann Zarco (Monster Yamaha Tech 3), the Frenchman used a soft front and rear MICHELIN Power Slick and this union also led to him setting the fastest lap and a new record on the sixth circulation with a time of 124.312, at an average speed of 184.3km/h around the 4.3km circuit. Sixth was Maverick Viñales (Movistar Yamaha MotoGP), just ahead of team-mate Valentino Rossi (Movistar Yamaha MotoGP) in seventh. Alvaro Bautista (Pull&Bear Aspar Racing) was eighth and had the honour of setting a new outright speed record for the circuit of 316.5km/h. Ninth went to Loris Baz (Reale Avintia Racing) with wild-card Mika Kallio (Red Bull KTM Racing) rounding out the top-ten.
Todays race was held in warmer conditions than had been experienced all weekend so tyre choice was an important factor and the selection given to all riders by Michelin was certainly an important factor. The available selection again highlighted Michelins continued dedication to supply all bikes, riders and manufacturers with tyres that work at all tracks and give them the best opportunity to match the correct rubber to their machinery and riding styles.
Michelin and the MotoGP Paddock now head across Europe and over the sea to England for the British Grand Prix which will be staged at Silverstone on Sunday 27th August.
Andrea Dovizioso  Ducati Team:
It was quite difficult this weekend to make the right decision about the tyres, because with a different temperature every day it made it complicated. At the end, we understood the tyres and we made the right decision. I was able to save the tyre and finish the race in a good shape. I couldnt start and push 100%, as well as finish 100% because you need to save tyres on this track, so I saved them for the end, but overall the feeling was really, really good during the race from the tyres.
Nicolas Goubert  Deputy Director, Technical Director and Supervisor of the MotoGP Programme:
We are very pleased with the way the whole weekend has gone. There were many challenges with the track temperatures, so the riders never really had an opportunity to get a rhythm with the tyres they wanted to use, but this also meant they were able to try all the compounds, as that proved in todays race. Again, we saw all six compounds chosen and a race at the end between one guy on a soft rear and one on a hard, which was a good advert for what we are trying to achieve and it produced a great show and one that we are pleased to have played a part in. It was also very pleasing to see the lap and race duration records broken today and for the top speed record to be set this weekend, this shows the tyres have durability, grip and can push to the limits. Just because we have had a good result here though we will not pat ourselves on the back, but we will see where we can continue to improve. We know that the next race is a particularly demanding track and on top of that there will probably be some unpredictable English weather to cope with, but that will be nothing new this season as we have had some unusual conditions to endure.
PaddockTalk Perspective
Target has acquired San Francisco-based transportation technology company Grand Junction, in order to help it move more quickly into the business of same-day delivery. The company had already been working with Target on a same-day delivery pilot program in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, prior to this deal. That pilot will expand this fall to more New York area stores before a broader rollout to other large metros starting next year.
The retailer had already dipped its toe in the water of on-demand, local delivery. It has tested same-day delivery in 2014, and later in partnership with Instacart. And this May it announced its plans for Target Restock, a next-day delivery service focused on “everyday essentials,” like household items, personal care products and other dry goods – similar to those you can order through Amazon Prime Pantry.
The Restocking service had been in testing with staff at Target's headquarters before expanding to a consumer-facing pilot with customers in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where Target is based.
Around the same time, Target also announced a small test of same-day delivery in New York. The pilot allowed guests shopping the Tribeca location to have their in-store purchases delivered anywhere in Manhattan, and to parts of Brooklyn or Queens. This eliminated the need for customers to haul their heavier purchases home themselves, or on public transit.
Grand Junction's technology was used in this NY area test, Target says.
The company offers a software platform that's used by retailers, distributors and third-party logistics providers to manage local deliveries through a network of more than 700 carriers. The software helps to determine the most efficient, the fastest route for a local delivery, while also tracking deliveries and giving the retailer an overview of carrier performance.
By bringing this technology in-house, Target says it will be able to offer same-day delivery in more areas, as well as assembly and installation services. Potentially, this could be used to speed up Target Restock from a next-day to a same-day delivery service, as well.
However, the deal is about more than just same-day, Target says. That includes all last-mile logistics needs, from regular online orders to same-day or next-day from stores.
With the acquisition, Target gains immediate access to Grand Junction's technology and carrier network, which will allow it to more quickly move into same-day delivery. Grand Junction's 13 employees will become a part of Target's technology team in San Francisco, where they'll best tasked with expanding the New York area pilot this year, ahead of a wider same-day delivery service rollout next year.
“Grand Junction's technology and algorithms will help Target deliver to guests faster and more efficiently,” said Arthur Valdez, executive vice president, chief supply chain and logistics officer, Target, in statement. “This acquisition is part of Target's ongoing efforts to strengthen Target's supply chain to provide greater speed, reliability and convenience for guests.”

Same-day delivery is an area where there's an increasing amount of competition. Amazon today offers Prime Now in over 30 U.S. markets, promising 2-hour delivery of thousands of items. A good handful of same-day grocery delivery services are also gaining steam, including Instacart, Shipt, Peapod and others. There's also Postmates for restaurant and general product delivery. And Uber is figuring out how to leverage its technology for than just moving more than people.
Meanwhile, Walmart has doubled down on a same-day pickup service for groceries, and even incentivized customers with discounts when online customers chose to ship items to the store for pickup instead of delivery. Walmart has also taken on Amazon with a free 2-day shipping service and has begun testing using store staff for last mile deliveries.
Lastly, startups like Curbside are working with major companies like CVS, Pizza Hut and Yelp, to expand access to same-day pickup services, too. (Target had also worked with Curbside before.)
“Target is seizing a tremendous opportunity to leverage local delivery as a retail differentiator,” said Rob Howard, Grand Junction's founder and CEO, who will become a vice president of technology at Target, as a result of this deal. “We're thrilled about helping to pursue this opportunity, and to join Target at this unprecedented time in retail.”
The move could help Target retain its footing as more brick-and-mortar stores face waning foot traffic and store closures. Target's online sales have been improving, having rose 22 percent in the last quarter, but it still faces huge threats from Amazon and Walmart in this area. That's especially true when it comes to groceries – something that's been made worse by Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods. However, Target recently boosted its Q2 earnings forecast due to an expected increase in comparable-store sales.
Nick Foles loves playing for head coach Doug Pederson and looks forward to competing on Sunday in hopes of bringing a Super Bowl to Philadelphia. (0:37)
As the legend goes, there was a day back in 2010 when a group of University of Arizona football players including Nick Foles took the court in a pickup game against most of the Wildcats basketball team. They not only held their own, but won both games that were played.
The score of the first game was 9-2 before the hoops stars realized this wasn't a joke. The football players -- including Foles -- could really play. They needed to take it seriously. It didn't help. They lost the next game, as well.
Former Arizona cornerback Trevin Wade tells the story. Foles had a similar version of what happened that day against the core (Brendon Lavender, Kyle Fogg, Jamelle Horne, Solomon Hill and Jesse Perry) of a college basketball team that finished the season ranked No. 18 in the country.
That group of football players had high-flying wide receiver Juron Criner dunking from all over the place. It had the sharp-shooting Wade swishing long-range jumpers. Inside, it had a bruising rebounder and low-post threat by the name of Rob Gronkowski, now the all-world tight end for the New England Patriots. It also had Foles, the seemingly unathletic quarterback who will start for the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday in Super Bowl LII against Gronkowski and the Patriots.
To this day, there are regrets there's no video. The football players insist it happened. Foles was one of the top players that day on the Arizona campus. It's hardly a surprise to those who have seen him dribble, pass and shoot. He's always one of the best, most skilled players when he takes the court.
By all accounts, Foles is a deadly shooter with a sticky handle and sneaky explosiveness. The 6-foot-6, 243-pounder has smooth moves and can throw it down with power and/or grace.
“I can do it all,” said a smiling Foles not-so-modestly of his hoops skills last week.

Watching Foles on the football field, it might be hard to envision this kind of basketball ability. He rarely tucks the ball and takes off. Foles has one yard rushing on 16 carries this season. He's not to be mistaken with Michael Vick.
“He definitely could move on the court. I don't get it,” Wade told ESPN by telephone this week. “It's like he's a different person.”
Speak to just about anybody who has seen Foles on a basketball court and they are complimentary of his game. He was a three-year varsity starter at Westlake High School in Austin, Texas, and led the district in rebounding as a sophomore. Foles got looks from college basketball programs.
Foles said he received letters from Division I schools, including Georgetown and Arizona State. But he told them his intention was to concentrate on football, and they backed off.
It has paid off. He's in his sixth NFL season preparing for his first Super Bowl.
Wade said Foles “definitely” could have played Division I basketball. Foles would have been a prototypical small forward playing on the wing. Former Eagles teammate Connor Barwin even called Foles the most impressive football player who he has played basketball with, and he's played with plenty. Barwin was part of some barnstorming Eagles teams with Foles that played charity games at schools throughout the Delaware Valley.
“I remember playing basketball, and with a quarterback you never realize how explosive he is. And the Eagles had this summer basketball charity game. And me and a bunch of guys -- the first time, we were all blown away,” Barwin said. “He was just drop-step dunking on people. And I was like, ‘Where the hell did this come from?' It's not like he had a 40-inch vertical, but he could jump and he was just so long.”
Foles isn't shy about discussing or showing people his basketball skills. Wade, who remains friendly with his former college teammate, said Foles' patented move was early in pickup games to come barely across midcourt and pull up for a long jump shot. More often than not ... swish. It was a message to the opposing team.
But not all of Foles' teammates are aware of his on-court ability. Wide receivers Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith had no idea the quarterback who took over for an injured Carson Wentz could play hoops.
When informed, Jeffery declared himself the best basketball player on the team and wanted a piece of Foles in the offseason. Still, Jeffery wasn't all that surprised, given Foles' size and footwork.
“Nick looks like he can play in the post and make a couple moves,” Jeffery said.
Quarterbacks that can excel on the basketball court aren't all that rare. It was a sentiment shared by Barwin, Jeffery and Smith. Jeffery even noted that he saw firsthand that New York Jets quarterback Josh McCown had serious game. Even Peyton and Eli Manning are supposed to be decent on the hardwood, even if it's not quite at Foles' level.
“[Foles] probably has a good jumper,” Smith said. “A lot of quarterbacks can shoot.”
Foles' lack of blazing speed or running on the football field might be deceiving. The Eagles prefer more run-pass options (RPOs), in which the quarterback is tasked with deciding to hand the ball off or keep it to throw. It involves some nifty footwork that wouldn't be possible for an unathletic quarterback.
Foles exhibits that same sneaky athleticism on the football field that makes him a good basketball player. It was evident late in the first half of the NFC Championship Game rout of the Minnesota Vikings. Foles was under pressure and shuffled left several times before firing a long touchdown pass to Jeffery before halftime. It was one of three touchdown passes he threw in the game of his life.
“Any time you've played different sports -- for me, it has always been basketball; that is an instinctual sport. You're dribbling the ball, passing,” Foles said. “I'm sure that has helped me a lot along the line with helping with my football instincts.”

Greta Van Fleet's becoming a rock staple, but have you ever stopped to wonder how they landed on the name? An 87-year-old great-grandmother named Gretna Van Fleet, of course—because what could be more rock than that?
The below picture, for starters, which marks the first time she'd seen the guys in five years (and the first time she met drummer Danny Wagner ever).
"They've matured, I'll say that," she told Billboard of the pictured backstage meeting with her namesake at their second Detroit show at the Fillmore.​
According to an interview with Billboard, the band's previous drummer was out to breakfast with his grandfather, who told him he needed to cut wood for Van Fleet, a resident of the band's Frankenmuth, MI hometown. When the drummer later mentioned the “interesting name” to the rest of the guys, they took it and ran with it—without the “N” in her first name to make it flow a bit better.
Gretna—who played sax and piano in a band in the ‘50s—says she didn't have anything to do with the band using her name, and when they told her, she “kind of laughed it off” and thought, “That won't last long. That's not a name for a band.” And here we are.
The band tells Billboard that the name keeps people guessing, and the fact that you'd never be able to tell what kind of music would come from "Greta Van Fleet" is something the guys really like about their name.
GVF will continue along their tour through October with plans to release their first full-length album sometime this year.
The band released their double EP, From The Fires, in 2017, and you can grab your copy here.
There's been a buzz around the Wood Brothers Racing shop knowing Pocono Raceway was coming up on the schedule.
It was last June that Ryan Blaney drove the Wood Brothers' No. 21 Ford to victory in the Pocono 400. Blaney now drives for a different team and Paul Menard has taken over. He can sense the team's excitement as it returns to Long Pond this weekend for the Pocono 400.
“Knowing how fast the 21 was last year, we have some notes to baseline off of,” Menard said. “Even though we're driving the car that won last year, the setups are going to be different because the rules are different. It's hard to stray too far from a winning combination, but different aero packages kind of dictate that. But we definitely have a good baseline to look at.”
In 13 races this season, Menard has three top-10 finishes — a pair of sixth-places at Daytona and Kansas and a ninth at Las Vegas.
He's had tough luck, too. Crashes at Phoenix, Texas and Talladega. At Dover, when a right-rear wheel hub went bad, he fell 46 laps behind while it was repaired and he finished 34th. He's 17th in the point standings.
“We've had good cars that we've had some issues during a race that's really hurt us,” Menard said. “Just things that kill your day.”
Of course, the biggest adjustment is working with a new team. Menard and crew chief Greg Erwin are new, as are some engineers and mechanics. Then there are four crew members who have worked on the No. 21 car for years.
“It's a pretty cool mix that we have,” Menard said. “I feel like we're at the point now where we can kind of do our own (thing).
“Early in the year, we knew we had a pretty proven package and were kind of scared to make changes. Now that we all know each other better — what I like out of a race car and some of the changes I'm sensitive to — we can implement that before the race whereas before we kind of searched to get to a point. Now we can start at that point a little quicker.”
Founded in 1950, the Wood Brothers is the oldest active team in NASCAR.
“Anytime you turn on one of those old shows (about NASCAR), the Wood Brothers are there,” Menard said. “Eddie and Len come to the track every weekend, great guys, work on the car. Len does our fuel mileage. They're iconic because they've been around forever and they still have a passion for the sport.”
In 22 career starts at Pocono, Menard has an average finish of 23.6 with his best showing being a ninth place in June 2012.
“I like Pocono, it's a unique track. You get to shift there; we don't get to shift very often during a race, so it's always fun,” Menard said. “All three corners are totally different, so there are compromises to be made. You can't set the car up for all three corners; you have to set it up for one corner and kind of hang on for the other corners. As a driver, it takes a lot of discipline to know that and make sure you kind of keep your eye on the corner that's going to pay off the dividends.”
Practice for the Pocono 400 at Pocono Raceway begins Friday at 11:35 a.m. with qualifying scheduled for 4:15 p.m. Also on tap Friday are two NASCAR Xfinity Series practice sessions and the ARCA Series General Tire #AnywhereIsPossible 200 at 5:45 p.m.
On Saturday, Cup Series practice is from 11 a.m. to 12:20 p.m. Xfinity Series qualifying is 9:05 a.m. with the Pocono Green 250 set for 1 p.m. On Sunday, the Pocono 400 gets the green flag at 2 p.m.

Iran Focus
London, 7 Dec - The Iran-backed Houthis are quickly losing power in Yemen, as infighting between them and fellow rebel group the General People's Congress (GPC) grows, and it is likely that they will take the Iranian Regime down with them.
This break up is not a sudden thing but was widely expected for a long time. Although the groups originally had shared interests, they no longer do, making an alliance fairly pointless.
The Houthis, who used the GPC in an attempt to gain some political legitimacy, are no more than an Iranian proxy and express far greater loyalty to the mullahs who kept them going for this three-year war than the Yemeni people.
While the Houthis wanted Yemen to essentially come under the Iranian Regime's control, the GPC righty opposed this attack on Yemen's sovereignty.
While some have suggested that it will be difficult to see what group, the Yemeni people will support, most Yemenis consider themselves to be Arab and, as such, will not accept the Iranian Regime's rule and will support the GPC or the internationally-recognised government over the Iran—backed Houthis.
They see that the Houthi proxies have done nothing to benefit Yemen and instead have sent them to the brink of disaster. The United Nations has even described the current the situation in Yemen as “the worst humanitarian crisis in the world”, for which the Iran-backed Houthis hold the majority of the blame.
The backlash against the Houthis and their Iranian masters has gotten even worse following the assassination of former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. Houthi gunmen, working on the order of the Iranian mullahs, shot the 75-year-old as he attempted to escaped Houthi-held Sanaa and posted a video of his lifeless body on social media.
His assassination, on Monday, was two days after he broke ranks with the Houthis over a severe disagreement and tried to resume talks with the current President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi.
In response to the assassination, Hadi urged the people in Houthi-controlled areas to rise up against the Iran-backed militias and told them that the Yemeni army which surrounded Sanaa was prepared to support any actions against the Houthis.
A spokesman for the legitimate government said: “The act is further proof that these militias adopt an ideology of exclusion. We call upon the Yemeni people to make the assassination of Ali Abdullah Saleh a turning point in the country's history and encourage all people to join ranks with the legitimate government and against the evil terrorists.”
WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND—Hundreds of people in New Zealand's second-largest city were evacuated from their homes Wednesday as wildfires burned down several houses and threatened to encroach further into some suburbs.
A helicopter pilot who was a decorated soldier died in a crash while fighting the blaze on Tuesday.
The mayors of Christchurch City and the adjacent Selwyn District declared a state of emergency. Selwyn Mayor Sam Broughton said changing winds had made the fires unpredictable.
He said the region had been unusually dry for three years and the grass in the hills had turned brown over the Southern Hemisphere summer.
Smoke and ash were being blown across Christchurch. Broughton said displaced residents were staying at evacuation centres or with relatives.
The new SFUO president talks about this year's campaign and looks to the future
On Feb. 11, the results of the 2017 Student Federation of the University of Ottawa (SFUO) general election were released. The election saw a voter turnout of 14.6 per cent, doubling last year's general election turnout of 7.8 per cent.
Hadi Wess, current vice-president social of the SFUO and a candidate on the United slate, was elected president with 2,481 votes.
In a statement to the Fulcrum, Wess discussed campaigning for this year's election, the challenges he faced during the campaign period, and his current plans as president-elect.
“I've learned a lot from the previous two elections and the two last mandates that I have served as vice-president social of the SFUO,” wrote Wess. “I was able to bring my experience, knowledge, and skills to run a stronger and more successful campaign this year alongside my teammates.”
According to Wess, he “had the opportunity to speak to many students in classes and one-on-one” to “get input from (them), so that decisions made in the future represent different identities, opinions, and perspectives.”
Wess said that his social media presence reached over 25,000 people in 10 days, and while he was happy with the increased student engagement, there were still challenges during the campaign period itself.
“It is very sad that, often during elections, some people find that using the politics of fear, hatred, and bullying is what could get them elected,” wrote Wess. “Because of that we see many baseless rumours and allegations with no foundations being spread out against some candidates.”
Despite these “rumours and allegations,” the new SFUO president is proud of his team for standing “strong, united, loving, and compassionate,” and of students for making “informed decisions and challenging those voices of fear, bigotry, and hatred.”
While Wess will not assume his new position until May 1, he said that in this interim period he will be “starting conversations and negotiations to build the foundation for a smooth transition and a successful mandate next year.”
However, come May 1, Wess said that he and the rest of the new executive will be “busy between projects like 101 Week organization, summer and fall U-Passes, budget preparation and presentation, the health plan, providing support to clubs, and running SFUO services and campaigns.”
Wess also said that he will be working on developing an SFUO office on the south-end of campus, as well as negotiating with the administration for more student spaces.
“For me, elections always serve as a reminder of how far I can push myself when chasing after something that I care about and believe in, and in this case, it is our campus and the student movement,” wrote Wess.
“One of the biggest lessons that I learned was that being a true leader does not necessarily require holding a title or assuming a role, it's in our actions, behaviours, mentalities, and attitudes.”
“However, winning the election is the easiest part of the job, and I know that myself and the next executive team have a lot of work to do to fight for our 36,000 students' rights, advocate on their behalf, and accommodate their needs.”
It's a rite of passage for every player that's laced up the skates in the last 17 years for the Vancouver Canucks:
Telling twin superstars Henrik and Daniel Sedin apart.
On the ice, it's easier. You have nameplates. You have numbers. You have Henrik at center, where he's amassed 1,037 points in 1,278 career games, with 798 assists. You have Daniel at left wing, with 1,003 points in 1,255 games, with 376 goals.
Off the ice? When the twins walk out of the dressing room wearing identical outfits -- yes, in true twin tradition, they often dress alike -- with their hair neatly trimmed in the same manner?
"I took it as a challenge," recalled Anaheim Ducks defenseman Kevin Bieksa, a close friend of the Sedins who played with them from 2005 through 2015. "I tried to get on top of it right away. It really only took me about a month. Once you figure it out ... they're not totally different, but they have very, very different personalities."
This is true. Henrik can be blunter than Daniel, who can be a bit more introspective. Like Bieksa said, they're not totally different: Both players are universally adored by those who have played with them in Vancouver.
"Every young guy I've ever talked to who played in Vancouver raves about their work ethic and the kind of people they are," said Mike Babcock, head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs.
"I think everyone's heard the stories about how good of guys they are. But until you actually wake up, day in and day out, and go to the rink with them, you don't realize how great they really are," said Bieksa. "Under those circumstances, people can get on your nerves over time, just naturally. But they're two guys that never got on your nerves. Easy, humble. Never complained about a thing."
That last virtue has gotten more work than the Sedins have this season for the Canucks.
The twins turned 37 in September, and they're averaging their lowest ice time in roughly a dozen seasons under new head coach Travis Green, who is less than 10 years their elder. Despite a recent uptick due to injuries in the Canucks' lineup, Daniel is at 14:20 per game, down from 18:23 last season; Henrik is at 14:34, down from 19:02 last season. This comes after a 2016-17 season that saw the twins post their lowest points per game averages since 2003.
They're in the last years of their contract in Vancouver, headed for unrestricted free agency next summer. They've ceded the top line to a collection of younger offensive talents.
We're witnessing the twilight of the Sedins. But while that might mean decreased ice time in the short term, that doesn't mean they won't try to force the coach's hand.
"We never talked about ice time [with Green]. Before the season, he said everyone needs to be better. But we honestly knew where the team was. We have great young guys. They need their ice time," Henrik Sedin told ESPN recently in New York.
"We're not going to complain. We know what needs to happen for the team to succeed. But we're going to take what we can, and force him to play us more."

The NHL's history is laden with beautiful freaks.
You have the seemingly immortal players like Gordie Howe and Jaromir Jagr. You have Zdeno Chara, a giraffe on skates who nonetheless became one of the NHL's best defensemen. And then you have the Sedin twins, the first two NHL players to have made a reasonable argument for Hall of Fame enshrinement with two players on the same plaque.

To watch the Sedins is to have seen a duo act as a singular entity. The Canucks maneuvered to draft them Nos. 2 and 3 in the 1999 draft, sensing how vital it was that they play together. Anyone that's watched them knows that's the case: Their familial sonar enabled them to make pinpoint passes whose perfect timing was a result of a shared brain. When they cycled in the corner, it was like watching two players do what it took five Russians to accomplish at the height of Soviet hockey dominance.
Even now, 17 years into their careers, there are still flashes of that brilliance.
"I still believe that power play-wise and on the cycle they're as good as anybody in hockey," said Babcock, before a recent Leafs game against the Canucks. "Father Time is always going to catch up to you. That's just the way it is. But they're still dominant players."
The Sedins are stars in the NHL; they're legends in Sweden, winning Olympic and World Championship gold for their home nation and being counted among the greatest players it ever produced.
"I think they're up there, among the top players. They've been around for a long time. And they're still playing at a really high level," said forward Elias Lindholm, 23, of the Carolina Hurricanes.
For Lindholm and other young Swedes, the Sedins have been a standard part of their hockey lives.
"They've had a big impact on me," said Lindholm. "You know those collectors hockey cards? One of my mom's best friends got a pack, the Sedins were in there, and me and my brother got them. I think that's my first memory of them. They were still playing in Modo [in the SHL]."
They've also had a big impact on the Canucks. Henrik leads the franchise in games played, assists and points; Daniel leads in goals. Henrik is the only Canuck to have won the Hart Trophy, in 2009-10; Daniel finished second to Corey Perry for the Hart in the following season. That's on the ice; off the ice, they've given back on both a grand scale -- a $1.5 million donation to a local hospital -- and on a small scale, like coaching teams in a local ball hockey tournament.
They're franchise icons, NHL icons and hockey icons.
When you're dealing with icons, it's not exactly easy to tell them to take a back seat, after over a decade of driving the bus. But that's what Travis Green needed to do in his first year as Canucks coach.

Green was elevated to the Canucks' head coaching gig after four years with the AHL Utica Comets. He's one of the NHL's youngest coaches at 46 years old. This means that the guy telling Henrik and Daniel that they'd have to take a cut in ice time was, in fact, one of their opponents on the ice as late as 2007.
Aren't coaches supposed to be like a dad, instead of being like your buddy?
"It's been a little bit different. But it hasn't been weird at all. It's actually great to have," said Henrik Sedin, noting that the twins actually played with assistant coaches Nolan Baumgartner and Manny Malhotra. "He's been around recently. He knows the league, he knows the players."
Green sought to establish a peer-to-peer rapport with the Sedins early in the season, offering the chance for frequent postgame debriefings for the three of them.
"Travis said he wants us to come in and talk with him after games. We don't really, though, because he's the coach," said Daniel Sedin. "But me and Henrik talk a lot before and after games. We're venting. So we don't really need to talk to Travis that much."
Daniel Sedin said that despite being contemporaries, there's still a wall between players and coaches.
"We've always looked at it like 'coach is coach' and 'players play.' If he wants to have a discussion, we'll have a discussion. For us, we're here to play hockey. He can do whatever he's here to do. No different than coaches we've had before," he said.
Henrik said that he, Daniel and Travis Green never had a formal sit-down before the season about their ice time. They didn't need to. The Sedins understood the necessity for rookie winger Brock Boeser (leading the team with 27 points), 22-year-old center Bo Horvat (10 goals and 10 assists, before his injury) and 25-year-old winger Sven Baertschi (8 goals, 10 assists in 30 games) to get their ice time as the team's top line.
"You have to understand that we've been in that situation too, where maybe we took guys ice time. Or got ice time that older guys wanted, too," said Daniel Sedin.
The Sedins also knew that Green really liked giving his checking line some work. After the ice time commitments to the first and third lines, the Sedins took what was left.
"We know where this team is at. We've had some tough years, and for a team to be successful, everyone has to buy in," Daniel Sedin said. "So for us to be successful, we need to buy in, and everyone needs to buy in. That's easy."
Well, sort of easy.
There is this thing called "pride." And the Sedins still have a lot of it.
"Man, you want to be out there. That's how you are as a player. You want to play as much as possible, of course, and in those key situations. Right now, we still get it once in a while. But they want to see [the younger players] as much as possible in those situations," said Daniel Sedin.
"As hockey players, you want to be out there when it matters. You want to be out there when you need to score a goal. Something that needs to be in a hockey player to be successful, and that's what we have in us," said Henrik Sedin. "It's what's made us successful. That's been tough."
Perhaps the toughest aspect of this change is the way the Sedins have had to recalibrate their internal clocks, which used to tick down to shifts with more regularity.
"You have to be really focused, each and every shift. Sometimes it's a long time between shifts, and you're on the bench. So that's the biggest change. You just have to try and stay focused, and be ready for it. Because you will sometimes get that ice time," said Daniel Sedin.
This is true. Especially when there's a significant injury, like the one the Canucks just suffered.

Horvat went on injured reserve last week with a broken foot, putting him on the shelf for up to six weeks. In the two games they've played since then, the Sedins have seen an uptick in ice time: Daniel played 17:08 and Henrik played 18:22 in a loss against the Calgary Flames on Saturday.

"We're going to have to lean on veteran guys. Everyone has to step up in certain areas when those kinds of players go out," said Green.
So we might get to see more of the Sedins for the next month, as Vancouver tries to stabilize itself during an adverse time. The Canucks are 14-12-2, having gone 5-4-1 in their last 10 games and losing two straight. No one expected them to be in playoff contention this season, which is why Vancouver has been one of the League's biggest surprises. The hope is that they can hang tight until Horvat returns.
The question is: How much more of the Sedins will we see after this season?
Their contracts -- each with a $7 million cap hit, because "twins" is why -- are up after this season. Both have full no-move protection, and neither has shown an appetite for leaving Vancouver during the season to play for a contender.
They've also never viewed this season as a victory lap before retirement. They wrote in The Players' Tribune that they might "have a few more years left in us." They talked with The Province about "being good players" to hopefully "force the Canucks to want to re-sign" them. Daniel Sedin said there's not been a moment when the twins have discussed this as the end, or a timeline towards the end of their NHL careers.
"No, no, no," he said, laughing. "This is a big year for the organization. We've had some tough times. For us, we want to get into the playoffs and play well, and set up this team for years to come."
No matter their roles are or what their time on ice adds up to, the goal for Henrik and Daniel Sedin remains the same as it was when they were the ones stealing shifts from veteran players.
"As we explained before the season, when we said that we wanted to stay: It's important for us that Vancouver make the playoffs. That's our goal," said Daniel Sedin.
"We'll see what happens, and where we go from there."
The Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) has bared its fangs and turned itself to an instrument of harassment against The Sun over publication of a Page 3 Girl photograph.
At the centre of the harassment is the commission's Director of Prosecution, Mr. Abdul Ter Kohol, who is colluding with a complainant to intimidate the newspaper, with a view to coercing it into monetary settlement.
Since The Sun inadvertently published a Page 3 Girl photograph of one Miss Temitope Akinyemi on May 25, 2016, which was sent by a syndicate whose real motive was to implicate and extort money from the newspaper, the NCC, through Kohol, has not allowed The Sun and its managers any rest.
The Enforcement Department of the NCC had, sometime this year, invited Editor, Daily Sun, Mr. Onuoha Ukeh, to its Abuja headquarters, following a complaint by the said Miss Akinyemi, over publication of her photograph as a Page 3 Girl.
Honouring the invitation, the editor wrote a statement at the NCC.
Before The Sun editor honoured the NCC invitation, Kohol had exhibited an unusual overzealousness, by making a telephone call to the newspaper's General Counsel, Barrister Obinna Kalu, and threatened that if the invitation was not honoured, he would use his position to get those invited arrested and prosecuted.
At the NCC office, when the editor honoured the invitation, in the company of the General Counsel and The Sun's Abuja Bureau Chief, Kohol invited them to his office and pronounced The Sun guilty even before the case was investigated. He threatened to take the officers to court, except The Sun settled and compensated the complainant.
Investigations revealed that after the editor's appearance at the NCC, the Enforcement Department investigated the matter and reported that following the circumstances the photograph was published and the enabling law, The Sun was not liable.
The Enforcement Department recommended that the NCC should not proceed with criminal prosecution of The Sun.
However, owing to his obvious vested interest in the case, Kohol ignored the Enforcement Department's recommendation and filed a case against The Sun and joined the Managing Director, Mr. Eric Osagie in the suit even though he had nothing whatosever to do with the publication and Ukeh, in their personal capacities. The charges were later withdrawn.
Discovering that Kohol was colluding with Miss Akinyemi's lawyers and thereby divulging official to them, The Sun petitioned the NCC Director-General, Mr. Afam Ezekude, and demanded Kohol's investigation, over allegations of “unprofessional and gross misconduct in the discharge of his duty.”
In the petition, The Sun highlighted how the agency's Director of Prosecution was leaking official information to complainant's lawyer; for personal gains.
Kohol was accused of taking personal interest in the case and, therefore, went clearly out to intimidate, threaten and cajole The Sun to settle and compensate Miss Akinyemi, actions contrary to the expectation of someone holding his office.
The petition said: “As events unfold, we discovered that the Director of Prosecution was actually working in league with Miss Temitope Akinyemi's lawyer, to extort money from our company (in the name of settlement), which will be later shared amongst them.
“In fact, the said prosecutor is instrumental and actively involved in the civil suit, which Miss Akinyemi eventually filed against the company. He supplies them with privileged official information arising from the criminal investigation, which he hijacked from the Enforcement Department because of his selfish interest.”
In the earlier case filed in Abuja, which was later withdrawn, the NCC accused The Sun, the MD and editor of violating the copyright Act, over the publication of Miss Akinyemi's photograph.
The Sun, the MD and editor had sued the NCC seeking an order for the enforcement of their fundamental human rights.
In the suit filed by Dr. Ehiogie West-Idahosa, they asked the court for a declaration that “the continuous threat of arrest, detention and preferment of criminal charges against the 1st and 2nd applicants and other staff of the 3rd applicants issued against the applicants by the respondent orally and vide the respondent's letters to the applicants dated 18/7/2016; 26/7/2016; and 9/11/2016, respectively, for an allegation of crime purportedly committed by one Daniel Ekiye, without the knowledge and authority of the applicant constitute a violation of the 1st applicant's rights to personal liberty and freedom of movement, as guaranteed by Sections 34, 35(1) and 41(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and under Articles 6 and 12 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, (CAP 10) laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 1990 and therefore unconstitutional, illegal, null and void.”
The applicants also sought a declaration “restraining the respondent, its agents, privies and assigns from preferring any criminal charge against the Applicants on account of an allegation of crime not committed by them in violation of the Applicants fundamental human rights referred to in relief (1) above.”
Following the withdrawal of the NCC suit, the applicants had also withdrawn the enforcement of the fundamental human rights suit.
However, owing to his personal interest in the matter, Kohol has moved to file the case against The Sun, the MD and editor.
Sources at the NCC said whenever Kohol is personally interested in a case, he goes all out to pursue it; without recourse to other authorities.
They also alleged high-level corruption in the Prosecution Department of the NCC, saying that Kohol allegedly colludes with complainants to extort money from companies whose cases are before the commission.
One NCC personnel, who declined to be named, said corruption in the NCC Prosecution Department is so enormous that they have “lost confidence in Kohol.” The source said Kohol played a similar role he is playing in the Miss Akinyemi's case in a copyright matter involving a telecommunication company from which huge sums of money was allegedly paid, which he shared with lawyers of the complainant.
Investigations revealed that Kohol and his cohorts joined The Sun MD and editor in the criminal prosecution case when The Sun is a legal entity that could be sued on its own, out of pure mischief and malice because they did not succumb to his threat and advice to pay Miss Akinyemi and her lawyers money as compensation.
Meanwhile, lawyers have faulted joining of The Sun MD and editor in the suit NCC filed against the newspaper.
In his reaction, Lagos human rights and constitutional lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, said joining of the MD and editor in the criminal case was “unacontionable, illegal, unlawful, wicked and unconstitutional.”
He also described it as “an attempt to intimidate and muzzle The Sun” and emphasised that it had long been decided in a suit, “Salomon Vs Salomon, that an individual cannot be charged in a case against a validly registered company. It is sheer madness. It is clearly meant to intimidate, coerce and muzzle the management of The Sun, for whatever reasons. This insanity cannot stand. It is an abuse of the court process.”
Counsel to The Sun, Dr Ehiogie West-Idahosa said Kohol has shown extreme bias and compromise in the handling of the case.
“What they are doing is unknown even to the NCC Act. It is arm-twisting tactics. But, it will fail miserably. It is unheard of, to attempt to criminalise officers of an organisation for purely corporate matter, assuming without conceding, that there's any liability whatsoever. Kohol and his agents are trying to make mockery of the Judiciary and the laws of our country.”
Also, Chief Charles Enwelunta, Mr Dele Igbinedion, Mr. Gideon Okebu and Mr Ige Asimudara submitted that for the charge to be sustainable, the prosecutor must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendants intentionally and actually committed the offence.
They submitted that the charge is an abuse of court process, insisting that for it to fly, the ingredient of the crime must be established and the ingredients are intention and actual act.
They said the company's officials are different from the company and they cannot be liable for any offence committed by the company, in a criminal case.
Igbinedion said: “It is misconception of law for a company's officials to be charged with the company, for an offence allegedly committed by company. The company's officials are only agents and if they are not personally involved in the commission of the offence, they cannot stand trial personally for an offence allegedly committed by another legal entity.”
Enwelunta also aligned himself with Igbinedion's submission.
“He said: “Officials of a company and the company are two, different legal entities in eye of the law.
“Each entity cannot take responsibility for the action of each other. It is legally wrong for The Sun Publishing Ltd's MD and its editor to be charged with the company for the offence allegedly committed by the company.”
A public Affairs analyst, Femi Ojo, on his part, said what people like Kohol and the NCC are doing will further damage the reputation and integrity of the Buhari government.
“If this is what has transpired, this man should be fired immediately from his job.
“It is people like him who give our dear president a bad name. How can a serious agency make the publication of a photograph its preoccupation, of all the important issues it has to deal with? They should stop embarrassing Mr. President.”

SINGAPORE, Feb 2 (IFR) - Asian credits were flat in thin muted trade flows ahead of the release of US non-farm payrolls figures later tonight.
“The market is quite subdued mainly because of the volatility in the US Treasury yields,” said one trader. Overnight long-term UST yields had surged with the 10-year and 30-year levels rising 6bp and 7bp, respectively.
The muted trade was reflected in Asian credit spreads as the iTraxx Asia ex-Japan investment-grade index, at 64bp/65bp, was largely unchanged from yesterday's close.
Yesterday's US$2.5bn jumbo offering of bonds from Chinese asset manager Cinda were faring reasonably well, given the soft markets.
The 3.875% 2023s were tightening to 137bp from reoffer spreads of 140bp over UST, while the 4.625% 2028s were about 1bp tighter. There were no quotes for the 5% 2048s.
Poly Real Estate's 3.95% 2023s were also performing strongly with the notes quoted at 148bp/143.5bp, after pulling in from reoffer of 155bp.
Noble's bonds were slightly down with the 6.75% 2020s seen at 50.3/51.4 and the 8.75% 2022s at 51.77/52.9. Its 6% perpetuals were a touch firmer at a cash price of 6.30/8.40 against Wednesday's 5.00/8.00.

TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd reported a 37 percent rise in operating profit in the third quarter and raised its full-year forecast as it expects higher auto sales in Asia while it also continues to reduce costs.
Japan's third-biggest automaker posted a 284.5 billion yen ($2.59 billion) operating profit in October-December, up from 207.6 billion yen a year earlier, and exceeding a mean estimate for 281.6 billion yen taken from 11 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Honda raised its forecast for full-year operating profit to 775 billion yen, based on an assumption for the yen to average around 110 yen versus the U.S. dollar in the year to March, from a previous forecast for 109 yen. ($1 = 109.6500 yen) (Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu)

WEST BROMWICH ALBION 1 BOURNEMOUTH 0
Aug 12 (Reuters) - Egyptian defender Ahmed Hegazi scored a first-half header on his Premier League debut to give West Bromwich Albion a well-deserved 1-0 victory over Bournemouth at the Hawthorns on the opening day of their season.
Striker Jay Rodriguez, bought from Southampton during the summer for 12 million pounds, was busy early on for the home side, going close twice in two first-half minutes with a header and a shot.
Hegazi, on loan from Egypt's Al Ahly, scored the only goal of the game for West Brom in the 31st minute, deftly heading Chris Brunt's inswinging ball from the right between the legs of Bournemouth keeper Asmir Begovic in the 31st minute.

The Orchard has acquired U.S. rights to the jazz-inspired drama “The Song of Sway Lake,” starring Rory Culkin, Robert Sheehan, and Mary Beth Peil.
“Sway Lake” is directed by Ari Gold (“Adventures of Power”), who co-wrote the film with Elizabeth Bull. Culkin portrays a young man who plots to steal a valuable, long-lost jazz record from his grandmother's lake house. His plan is derailed when his accomplice (Sheehan) falls for the matriarch.
The movie will be released in theaters on Sept. 21 and on VOD and digital HD on Sept. 25. Producers are Gold through his Grack Films company, Michael Bederman (“Spotlight”), Allison Rose Carter (“American Honey”), and Social Construct's Zak Kilberg. The film was executive produced by Garrett P. Fennelly and Anne Bernstein.
Kew Media Group launched the film to the international market at the Cannes Film Festival. The film will be continuing to tour international festivals this summer.
“'The Song of Sway Lake' received strong buyer interest in Cannes,” said Jonathan Ford of Kew Media Group. “Its stellar cast and ultra-high production values set it apart.”
Evan Morehouse from the Orchard negotiated the U.S. deal with Benjamin Weiss and Derek Kigongo of Paradigm and attorney Orly Ravid from MSK on behalf of the filmmakers.
JAMES ANDERSON is urging England's chastened players to block out the ‘outside noise' from a growing bandwagon of critics ahead of Friday's pivotal Second Test against Pakistan at Headingley.
England head north with criticism still ringing in their ears following a nine-wicket loss in the series opener at Lord's against the impressive tourists, who will clinch a first series win on these shores since 1996 if they avoid defeat in Leeds.

A miserable performance at the home of cricket saw England lose their first Test of a home summer for the first time in 23 years, but also – rather more worryingly – extend their sequence without a Test win to eight matches.
Opener Mark Stoneman was the first casualty of the insipid events at Lord's, losing his place to Lancashire's Keaton Jennings.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan went much further by making the bold suggestion that either James Anderson or Stuart Broad – who have taken a combined 946 Test wickets between them – should be dropped.
Vaughan, who said that England's problems have “gone beyond just changing the opening batsman” later went onto state that Broad should be the one to make way if the hosts elect to start with Nottinghamshire team-mate Chris Woakes in Leeds.

That such a respected voice in cricket such as Vaughan should openly state that one of England's star two bowlers from the last decade should be axed is indicative of the deep sense of disquest at the side's recent Test slump.
Acknowledging that criticism will always come with the territory when a team is on such a disappointing run, record England Test wicket-taker Anderson, who turns 36 at the end of next month, said: “It was not our best performance and when you suffer a heavy defeat, there is always a lot of noise around that.
“Lots more opinions come out and say ‘this has got to be done and that has got to be done.' There is not a lot as players that we can do about that.
“If the managers and selectors think that feathers have got to be ruffled, all we do as players is concentrate on our job and train hard and when Friday comes around, be prepared to put in a better performance than last week. The outside noise is always something that is there.
“We (Anderson and Broad) have got 950 wickets and are doing the best we can for this team and trying to perform well enough to turn this team around.”
Should they lose in Leeds, England will slip to sixth in the Test rankings, but Anderson believes that there is no fundamental problem and feels that the squad for the second Test represents the ‘best 12 in the country' currently available.
What Anderson does acknowledge is that England need a catalyst to kickstart their Test form, with the onus being on the likes of himself and Broad, captain Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow to provide some special contributions.
Anderson and Broad did exactly that in England's last victory at Leeds back in 2016 with the former recording splendid match figures of 10-45 to help defeat the touring Sri Lankans by an innings and 88 runs.
The eye-catching personal haul enabled Anderson to cast aside his Headingley hoodoo, a ground where he has previously toiled, in fine fashion, with England needing similar levels of leadership and authority now.
Anderson said: “It is quite easy for the confidence of the team to take a hit when you have a defeat like the first Test. It is going to take some special individual performances this week. There is a lot of quality in the squad, not just me and Stuart and there are lots of players who can put their hand up and put in some some match-winning performances.”
Among that number is Root, who will be desperate to set an example on his home ground.
Anderson said: “When the team performs badly, one of the first people who comes in for criticism is the captain. I think he has managed it brilliantly.
“He would probably admit he is not in the best rhythm with the bat, but he showed his quality and grit the other day with the 68 he got even though he was not as fluent as he normally would be. But he has been great so far (as captain).”
Hours after “Bachelor In Paradise” contestant Corinne Olympios hired a top attorney and power publicist to take on her case, her co-star DeMario Jackson has also broken his silence. Jackson also claims he will be pursuing legal action.
“It's unfortunate that my character and family name has been assassinated this past week with false claims and malicious allegations,” Jackson said in a statement to E! News. “I will be taking swift and appropriate legal action until my name is cleared and, per the advice of legal counsel, will be seeking all available remedies entitled to me under the laws.”

PINEDALE, Wyo. (Reuters) - A judge has ruled that U.S. wildlife managers erred in denying Endangered Species Act protection to bison at Yellowstone National Park and must reconsider extending such safeguards to America's largest pure-bred herd of wild buffalo.
The decision was welcomed on Thursday by wildlife advocates who petitioned the Obama administration in 2014 to protect bison in and around Yellowstone, where animals wandering outside park boundaries are culled for slaughter by the hundreds each year.
The seasonal culling is supported by ranchers in the region, particularly in Montana, concerned about exposure of livestock to disease, competition for grass and property damage from straying bison.
“This is a victory for bison,” Ken Cole, director of the Buffalo Field Campaign, told Reuters by telephone.
Officials for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said they were reviewing the ruling, issued on Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in the District of Columbia.
Yellowstone's herd of 4,000-plus bison constitutes the largest and one of the last free-roaming, genetically pure groups of an animal that once roamed North America by the millions before being hunted to near extinction in the late 1800s.

Conservation groups have argued that endangered species status is necessary to ensure the long-term survival of wild bison, also widely known as buffalo, and help restore the creature to more of its historic natural range.
The bison, a shaggy, hump-shouldered animal weighing up to 2,000 pounds (990 kg) and standing 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulders, was officially designated the U.S. national mammal in 2016.
The Fish and Wildlife Service concluded in 2015 that conservation groups had failed to present sufficient evidence that the Yellowstone buffalo band was imperiled.
Cooper ruled that the Interior Department agency had erroneously failed to consider or otherwise ignored evidence indicating Yellowstone bison may be threatened or endangered.
The ruling hinged on a scientific dispute over whether there are two genetically distinct populations of bison at Yellowstone, known respectively as a central herd and a northern herd. Conservationists cited research suggesting the government's overall target at the park of 3,000 bison was too low to prevent extinction of one or both of them.
Government biologists dismissed that research. But Cooper said the Fish and Wildlife Service was required by law to explain why it found the research irrelevant, and he ordered a new agency review of whether Yellowstone bison merit protections.
The decision has no bearing on the estimated 160,000 head of privately raised bison, most of them in the West and consisting mainly of animals that carry cattle genes and are bred for commercial production.
In this feature to commemorate the First World War, we will bring you the news as it happened in 1917, as reported by the Morpeth Herald. All material is published with kind permission of the Mackay family. We thank them for their support and generosity in allowing us access to their archive.
Sir,— May I once more encroach upon your valuable space in order to thank those ladies who have so kindly knitted socks for the 16th, 18th, and 19th Northumberland Fusiliers?
Let me say in my own name, and in that of the Ladies' Committee, how extremely grateful we are for their help in the past, and ask them to continue their good work in the future until such time as it is unnecessary to provide them.
That the men appreciate these comforts is evidenced by the letters which are received by the committee from the officers and soldiers themselves.
The means to procure the wool is supplied by the Comforts Committee of the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce, and the Ladies' Committee have endeavoured to send 100 pairs of socks per week to each battalion during the past winters. Therefore 300 pairs per week are required.
I shall be at the Soldiers' Institute, Morpeth, every Monday from 3 to 4pm, commencing Monday, October 8th, when I trust ladies may find it convenient to come for wool, and return the completed socks.
To any ladies at a distance who are unable to come for wool I shall be pleased to send by post. Thanking you for your courtesy— Yours etc.,
M.I. RENWICK.

P.M. CHURCH, MORPETH
There was a fairly large congregation at the annual harvest thanksgiving services held on Sunday in connection with the Primitive Methodists Church, Morpeth, when the pulpit was occupied by the Rev. J.C. Sutcliffe.
The pulpit and communion rails were beautifully decorated with the produce of both garden and field, while a table within the rails was heavily laden with fruit and vegetables. The choir, under the leadership of Mr J.T. Procter, organist, ably rendered appropriate music for the occasion.
At the evening service the text taken was: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it dies, it bringeth forth much fruit.” The substance of these words was the answer to a request made to Jesus by the Greeks.
It is true that life in its highest and best form can only be attained through death. This is only realised by self-sacrifice. The Greeks at that time were the standard nation of culture. They were trained from youth upwards to culture the body and enjoy themselves. It is because of this self-culture, self-enjoyment, and aspiration to the primary place in the world that has brought the German nation to what it is today.
The harvest thanksgiving festival was continued on the Monday night, when the Rev. J.C. Sutcliffe delivered a very interesting lecture on his experiences with the Y.M.C.A. in Belgium. The chair was taken by the Mayor (Councillor J.R. Temple), supported by Councillor R.N. Swinney and Dr Drysdale.
The Mayor said he was pleased to be present. At one time it was believed that there would be no harvest. The display of fruit and vegetables, however, showed that the crops were bountiful. He was especially pleased to welcome back to Morpeth the lecturer, after his noble work with the Y.M.C.A. at the Front.
The lecturer said it was rather difficult for people at home to realise that it was possible to don the khaki and take one's place on French soil within a little less than 36 hours. He took the 9.26am train from Morpeth; at 8 o'clock on the Saturday night he was standing on French soil; and next day he was able to take his place in a hut some five or ten miles behind the front line trenches in Belgium.
On the boat he came in contact with all manner of people — British Tommies, Belgian soldiers returning, civilians, and Frenchmen.
On the Sunday he arrived at his destination, a short distance behind the firing line, where he at once noticed what was one of the outstanding features of the British Tommy — his humour — which continually came into play no matter when and where he was.
Another thing apparent was the Tommy's unselfishness. If a strange Tommy came into the hut and wanted a particular article, it was quite common for another Tommy to buy him the necessary article if he found that the stranger lacked the necessary means to procure that article.
He would never forget the time when the great explosion of the mine took place, which marked the beginning of the great advance. From that time onwards the Y.M.C.A. workers had a very busy time attending to those wounded who could walk, as everyone who was able to walk was expected to do his best.
With the aid of numerous stories, the lecturer illustrated many interesting as well as very pathetic instances he had been called upon to witness in the discharge of his duties.
In conclusion he said one thing the war had done for mankind — it had brought man closer to man and had broken down the barrier of caste and class. It had brought them into one brotherhood, which he hoped would continue for all.
At the close of the lecture the fruit and vegetables were offered for sale by Mr T. Clark, auctioneer, when the handsome total of £7 was realised.
VEGETABLES FOR THE NORTH SEA FLEET
THE Morpeth Branch Depot is now open every Wednesday from 9.30am till noon, when gifts of fresh fruit and vegetables will be gratefully received at the Town Hall.

James, chief constable of the county, would prepare a report on the question of a war bonus for the county policemen for consideration at the next meeting of the committee.
MORPETH BOROUGH UNIONISTS
A meeting of the Executive Council of the Morpeth Unionist Association was held on Saturday in the Conservative Club, Morpeth, presided over by Mr Frederic Wise, at which a representative gathering of delegates from all parts of the constituency were present.
As the party truce is till in existence, the meeting deprecated any political propaganda work carried on in the constituency until the war was brought to a successful conclusion, and further resolved to assist and support the National War Aims Committee campaign.
FLAG DAY
A flag day was organised by the members of the Red Cross in Broomhill and district. The response (considering how badly the pit has worked lately) was generous.
The sum of £20 was realised and will be handed over to the Order of St John of Jerusalem and the Red Cross Society.
WAGES FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS
The Corn Production Act, passed on August 21st, which guarantees prices of wheat and oats, also makes provision for fixing minimum rates of wages. All farmworkers, and also workers in market gardens, nursery grounds, orchards, woods and osier beds, are included under the Act, which applies to boys, women and girls as well as men.
For the purpose of settling the lowest rates of wages which may be paid to workers in agriculture, a Central Agricultural Wages Board is about to be formed, consisting of 16 members representing employers, 16 members representing workers, and seven impartial persons appointed by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
The Wages Board will be established by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, after consultation with the Minister of Labour. It will have power to issue permits to enable workers who are infirm, or physically injured, to obtain employment at less than the minimum rates.
Nothing in the Act prevents the payment of wages at rates higher than the minimum rates.
District Wages Committees will be set up, each comprising an equal number of representatives of employers and workers, and also one or more impartial persons appointed by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. These committees will make recommendations to the Central Board as to the rates of wages applicable to their districts.
The representative members on the Central Board will be partly elected by organisations representing farmers and labourers, and party nominated by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
The President will be glad to receive suggested names of representatives of employers, submitted by the farmers' organisations or by groups of at least ten farmers, and of representatives of workers, submitted by labourers' organisations or by groups of at least ten agricultural labourers. From among the persons so suggested nominated representative members of the Central Board and of the District Committees will be selected.
All suggestions of names, together with the full postal address of the persons suggested, should be forwarded at an early date to The Secretary, Board of Agriculture and Fishers, 80 Pall Mall, S.W.1. Members of the Central Board and of District Committees will be entitled to an allowance of out-of-pocket expenses.
A memorandum giving fuller details of the provisions of the Act may be obtained post free on application.
CO-OPERATIVES AND SUGAR SUPPLIES
Hitherto the supplies of sugar to local tradesmen, multiple shops, and co-operative societies have been on the basis of the 1915 requirements. In many cases where retailers have had fewer customers they have been able to give above the average supplies, but the fact that co-operative societies have greatly increased in membership since the War, has, in some districts, led to a restriction that has been irksome.
The institution of the National Sugar Card System will remove that difficulty, and place all traders on equitable footing — a feature on the scheme that commends it to the co-operative societies of this part of the country.
They will be guaranteed equal supplies with other retailers proportionately to the number of persons for whom they cater, so that housewives registering with co-operative societies will be as well placed with regard to sugar as if they registered elsewhere.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress on Friday escalated a campaign against U.S. law enforcement agencies over their probe of Trump's ties to Russia, releasing a disputed memo that the FBI warned was misleading and inaccurate.
The previously classified document, written by Republicans on the House of Representatives intelligence committee, alleges that the federal probe of potential collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia was a product of political bias against Trump at the FBI and Justice Department.
Ignoring a plea from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Trump approved the memo's release without redactions, deepening an extraordinary breach between the president and senior law enforcement officials over a probe that has dogged him during his first year in office.
Democrats said the four-page memo mischaracterizes highly sensitive classified information and was intended to undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller's criminal probe into the Russia matter launched in May 2017 that grew out of an earlier FBI investigation. They warned Trump against using it as a pretext to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who hired Mueller and oversees the investigation, or Mueller himself.
Mueller also is examining whether Trump has committed obstruction of justice in trying to thwart the Russia probe.
Asked by reporters whether the memo made him more likely to fire Rosenstein or whether he had confidence in him, Trump replied, “You figure that one out.” Dismissing Rosenstein would likely ignite a huge political firestorm, as his firing of FBI chief James Comey did last year.
A White House official later said there have been no discussions about firing Rosenstein.
When asked about the potential dismissal of Rosenstein, White House press spokesman Raj Shah told CNN late on Friday that there would be “no changes” at the Justice Department.
“We fully expect Rod Rosenstein to continue on as the deputy attorney general,” he said.
The memo alleges that the Federal Bureau of Investigation concealed the Democratic ties of a source the agency used to justify surveillance on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign advisor with ties to Russia. The memo revealed the names of senior FBI and Justice Department officials including Rosenstein who it said had signed off on this.
“I think it's a disgrace what's happening in our country,” Trump told reporters when asked about the memo, adding that “a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves.”
Some lawmakers accused Trump of playing into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin after, as Republican Senator John McCain put it, Russia “engaged in an elaborate plot to interfere in an American election and undermine our democracy.”
“If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin's job for him,” McCain, who is being treated for brain cancer, said in a statement.
Mueller's probe has led to guilty pleas by two of Trump's foreign policy advisers to charges of lying to the FBI, and indictments of former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Manafort's business partner Rick Gates.
Trump has called the investigation a “witch hunt,” denying any collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice. Moscow has denied any election meddling.

‘SACRED INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS'
In a swipe at U.S. law enforcement leaders on Twitter hours before the memo's release, Trump said, “The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago.”
It was his latest attack on top law enforcement officials. Trump fired Comey last May as the FBI pursued the Russia probe, leading to Mueller's appointment by Rosenstein.
The FBI on Wednesday had expressed “grave concerns about material omissions of fact” in the document and urged that it not be made public. Writing on Twitter, Comey branded the memo “dishonest and misleading.”
FBI Director Christopher Wray sent a message to bureau employees apparently aimed at boosting morale after the memo's release. “I stand by our shared determination to do our work independently and by the book,” Wray said in the message, excerpts of which were seen by Reuters.

The memo was commissioned by the Republican chairman of the House intelligence panel, Devin Nunes. He said it laid bare “serious violations of the public trust, and the American people have a right to know when officials in crucial institutions are abusing their authority for political purposes.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, criticized by Trump for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, offered praise for Rosenstein as well as the department's No. 3 official Rachel Brand on Friday, saying they “represent the kind of quality and leadership that we want in the department.”
The memo focused on court-approved surveillance of Page, the former campaign advisor, and said the FBI used a source who was strongly biased against Trump, former British spy Christopher Steele, to justify the action.
It alleged that a dossier of alleged Trump-Russia contacts compiled by Steele, and funded in part by U.S. Democrats, formed an “essential part” of requests to a special court to be allowed to conduct electronic surveillance on Page that began in October 2016.
It said the initial application and subsequent renewal applications, signed off on by various senior Justice Department officials, did not mention the link between Steele and the Democrats. It also portrayed Steele as “passionate” about Trump not becoming president.
Despite the memo's charges, neither the focus on Page nor the FBI's investigation of Trump-Russia ties began with the Steele dossier. Page came to the FBI's attention as early as 2013, when he met in New York with Russians who were officers of the Kremlin's foreign intelligence service, sources have said.
The memo acknowledges that the FBI counterintelligence investigation began in July 2016, three months before the request for electronic surveillance on Page, as a result of the activities of another Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos.
Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that Russia had political dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, information Australian officials passed to the U.S. government, the New York Times reported in December.
“The selective release and politicization of classified information sets a terrible precedent and will do long-term damage to the Intelligence Community and our law enforcement agencies,” House intelligence committee Democrats said in a statement.
They said they hoped the panel would vote on Monday to release their own memo responding to the allegations. Shah, the White House spokesman, told CNN Trump “would be inclined” to let that memo be released if it clears a security and legal review.
RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's crown prince wants to build a mega-city with the latest robotics under his grand plan to reform the kingdom.

Civil servant Amer al-Ghamdi has a simpler dream: to buy an affordable home.
Whether Ghamdi and some 1.2 million Saudis in a similar financial position manage to do so will be vital if Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is to convince his people that the reform plan will benefit not just the super-rich.
Ghamdi, 35, spends most of his $2,670 monthly wage paying back loans he took to get married and buy a car. He and his wife, Hanan, now have three children and struggle to save money.
Buying a home is out of the question. A 250-square metre (2,691 square feet) house in Saudi cities costs from 700,000 to 850,000 riyals ($186,000 to $226,000), said Ibrahim Albuloushi, head of U.S. property consultant Jones Lang LaSalle in Saudi Arabia.
That is up to 10 times the annual salary for a low-income family in the Gulf Arab state.
“I tried to look for one of my relatives in Saudi to pay off my debts and give me a down payment to apply for a house at one of the commercial banks, but the interest will be very high and I am already paying a lot,” said Ghamdi, who lives in the capital Riyadh.
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, was once awash in petrodollars. This helped it provide a cradle-to-grave welfare system for its citizens with almost no taxation.
But a slump in oil prices has made fiscal discipline and diversification away from oil vital. Prince Mohammed's Vision 2030 plan sets out to modernise the economy and reform the deeply conservative country, the birthplace of Islam.
The young prince, 32, has moved forcefully and rapidly where earlier leaders moved gradually and achieved moderate results.
AFFORDABLE HOMES
Some Saudis, however, are sceptical. Western media have reported extravagant purchases by the crown prince, including a $300 million French chateau and a $500 million yacht.
In response to a question about these reports in an interview with U.S. network CBS in March, Prince Mohammed said his personal life was “something I'd like to keep to myself” but that he was a rich man who also made donations to charity.
The first contracts awarded for the NEOM business zone mega-project in the northwest of the country were for five palaces for the royal family.
Some critics say the pace of reform is too fast. They cite cuts to a generous subsidy system and the introduction of value-added tax early this year, moves that have hit some Saudis hard and eaten away at savings.
Compounding problems, the population has grown. It reached 32.55 million in 2017, a rise of 44 percent from 2004, and Riyadh's boundaries are growing rapidly.
The housing minister says there are plans to build 1 million houses in five years with an investment of over $100 billion, mainly through public-private partnerships. Deals have been signed with South Korean and Chinese firms and U.S. companies have expressed interest.
“Real estate is the mirror of the economy. You cannot build homes if people cannot afford to buy them,” said Abdullah al-Sudairy, chief executive of mortgage finance company Amlak International. “Affordable housing means cost is five to six times annual income... We are not there yet.”
The ministry wants 60 percent of Saudis to own homes by 2020. It is working with local banks to facilitate financing and help developers increase the supply of affordable units by reducing red tape.
WAITING LIST
Some 500,000 Saudis are on a waiting list for the Saudi Real Estate Development Fund (REDF), an arm of the housing ministry which offers Saudis interest-free loans to buy state-backed houses which cost around 650,000 riyals. This can be paid in long-term monthly instalments of up to 2,500 riyals each.
Khalid al-Amoudi, REDF general supervisor, said most could have access to finance in the next three years.
Ghamdi has been on the waiting list since 2011 and relief is nowhere in sight.
He has asked his wife to look for a job. But the last offer she received at a food factory offered only 3,500 riyals a month, most of which would have been used to put her infant daughter in nursery and for transportation costs.
Ghamdi is worried about taking out a new bank loan because of fears the government may make further cuts in state spending.
Salman al-Shedoukhi, a 30-year-old engineer with a monthly income of 15,000 riyals, also wonders if he will ever receive a government-backed house.
“To get bank financing for an average 900,000-riyal home, you will end up paying double this amount. It means I would spend 20 years using half my salary to pay off the loan,” he said.
To save money, he has moved into his father's house with his wife and two daughters. But he is still burdened by a loan taken out four years ago to get married.
NO ROOM FOR ERROR
Members of the Shura Council, a government advisory body, have criticised the housing ministry for slow progress in solving the problem and fulfilling citizens' aspirations, questioning the number of land plots handed over.
“The housing ministry's biggest achievement is chaining the citizens with a big loan from commercial banks and a bigger monthly instalment,” Abu Yazid Al Huwaiti, a Saudi citizen, wrote in a Twitter post in April.
Some housing officials have been replaced in recent years for failing to tackle the affordability issue.
There is no room for error as Prince Mohammed is counting on people like Ghamdi to support his reforms.
“Will they achieve 100 percent of the very ambitious goals they have set for themselves? Probably not,” said David Dew, who is managing director of SABB bank and monitors housing and unemployment.
“But will they make serious progress? Absolutely yes, they have to and they will.”

RICHMOND, Va. -- Former Washington Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan made it clear from his first tweet: He missed being part of “Redskins nation.” Based on fans' responses to him, they miss him as well. And later McCloughan tweeted he would return “if the situation was right.”
It's hard to imagine the situation ever being right again for either side. But McCloughan still has interest in the team he worked for for more than two years -- and fans still want his insight. He's been willing to share that insight on Twitter. (He even jumped into the Colin Kaepernick fray. When asked if Kaepernick was good enough to be an NFL starter this year, McCloughan simply responded, “Yes.”)
I miss Redskins nation...the fans, coaches, players, trainers and the owner. Stay positive, they will compete. — Scot Mccloughan (@MccloughanScot) August 9, 2017
Yes if the situation was right — Scot Mccloughan (@MccloughanScot) August 9, 2017
I wanted Brandon. He's gone to the pro bowl already, he sets a culture. https://t.co/3TuB9Y8CXL — Scot Mccloughan (@MccloughanScot) August 14, 2017
Among the topics he has discussed since joining Twitter last week:
Quarterback Kirk Cousins: In the offseason, McCloughan said Cousins had hit his ceiling, though he didn't specify how high that meant. While he advocated for Cousins to get the starting job in 2015, he wasn't in favor of re-signing him at any cost. The prevailing notion: Cousins was good, not great.
When asked if Cousins was a top-10 quarterback, McCloughan replied, “Yes.” And when asked if he had the top pick in the draft and could sign Cousins or draft a QB, he simply said, “I'd take a pass-rusher.”
Running back Matt Jones: He's fallen out of favor with the coaches and barring injuries it'll be tough for him to make the roster. But one of those players ahead of him that coaches were most excited to see -- Keith Marshall -- already is lost for the season. Still, there's a good shot Jones won't make the 53-man roster.
But McCloughan told fans he still believes in the 2015 third-round pick “big time.”
Why?
“Big body, good feet, good hands, speed and instinct.”
Guard Brandon Scherff: McCloughan liked him from the start, and his reasoning for drafting him hasn't changed. But Scherff was selected to play tackle, only to be moved inside early in his first camp. The Redskins passed on defensive end Leonard Williams to select Scherff.
McCloughan was asked about that, too, and replied: “Tough, but I made the right decision.” He later expanded on the decision: “I wanted Brandon. He's gone to the pro bowl already, he sets a culture.”
He later said Scherff would become an All-Pro someday.
The Redskins' draft: McCloughan was fired in early March but said the draft board had already been set -- and was followed. The board always has involved input from multiple people, but McCloughan was in charge. Boards are tweaked after the combine and medical reports, but McCloughan said the Redskins followed his draft/free agent board to a “T,” with one exception. One source said seventh-round corner Josh Holsey was not on the original board in March.
McCloughan was asked, “Who is your proudest signing/draft pick during your time with Skins? And favorite pick other than Allen this year by Skins?”
The response: “[Scherff], Crowder, Kyshoen Jarrett and Matt Jones is going to be a stud. Ryan Anderson this year.”
McCloughan said he figuratively “stood on the table” for Crowder in 2015. He raved about Crowder early in the 2015 training camp, too.
And on Twitter, McCloughan predicted third-round corner Fabian Moreau could be a starter down the line “sooner than later.” And that both Moreau and 2016 third-round corner Kendall Fuller will be "damned good at a position that's hard to find." McCloughan had end Jonathan Allen as a top-five pick; Allen fell to 17.
McCloughan said Jarrett would be a starting safety now if not for the nerve damage to his arm that he suffered in the 2015 regular-season finale. He hasn't played since that game. But McCloughan said D.J. Swearinger will solve the Redskins' safety problems and agreed that fellow safety Su'a Cravens would make a big jump in Year 2 after switching from linebacker.
The Redskins signed Swearinger in free agency. They also signed receiver Terrelle Pryor, whom McCloughan said was his “#1 FA.”
One last draft nugget involved center Ryan Kelly from Alabama in 2016. McCloughan was asked what player the team missed out on because he was selected right before they picked. It was Kelly, taken 18th. And it led to Washington, with the 21st pick, trading down one spot and taking receiver Josh Doctson.
But McCloughan also predicted current center Spencer Long, who was moved to the position in the spring of 2016, would have a major impact this year.
Among his other thoughts: He likes linebacker Zach Brown, another free-agent signee, and McCloughan said there's a 50-50 chance third-string quarterback Nate Sudfeld becomes a starter.

East Tennessee church leaders are filling sanctuaries, learning to protect their flocks from armed intruders after shootings targeting Tennessee and Texas congregations.
Houses of worship without security plans “are in denial,” said Blount County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Josh Blair.
"We have got to get rid of the thought that it's never going to happen in my church,” Blair told 1,100 people at a Nov. 27 "active shooter" seminar for houses of worship he led at East Maryville Baptist Church.

"Do you think in Texas, when they came to church to worship the Lord, they thought someone was going to come in and shoot their church up? I guarantee they didn't," Blair said.
It was Nov. 5 when a gunman killed 26 people, including an unborn baby, and wounded 20 more at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Six weeks earlier, on Sept. 24, a woman died and seven people were injured at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, Tennessee.

After the Texas massacre, many East Tennessee churches called law enforcement seeking guidance. Their calls resulted in free Blount and Knox county security meetings. An estimated 1,000 faith representatives attended a Knox County Sheriff's Office church safety seminar Dec. 2 at Temple Baptist Church in Powell.
Law enforcement officials often advise individual churches on safety, but such large meetings are rare. Religious leaders and law officers agreed the sessions were heartbreaking, soul-searching and necessary.
What should a church do?
Many Tennessee congregations are discussing what security they need, want and can afford. Some no longer debate guns. They worship, some for years, under the watch of security teams comprised of armed and unarmed church members.
At Antioch's Burnette Chapel, services held after the September shooting saw a few churchgoers, handguns on hips, watching the church entrance.

Some churches employ off-duty law enforcement or private security guards. Many houses of worship create what's called "layers of protection" — security may include employing an off-duty officer, using in-house security and locking doors.
Some congregations decide against guns. They lock doors during services, monitor security cameras, and ask members to be more watchful of anything or anyone unusual.
Who's bringing the guns?

Josh Blair advocates churches use armed, trained security. Proper security training is key. East Tennessee law officers don't encourage every church member with a handgun carry permit to pack a pistol to worship.

Blair asked those at the Maryville seminar to imagine an armed intruder in the church. If everyone in the congregation pulls a gun, innocent people will get hurt.
“What if every person in this room picked up a hymnal and tossed it at that gunman?" Blair suggested. "I don't know a marksman alive that can make accurate hits if we are throwing every hymnal we got at him.”
Protecting the flock

Churches must balance welcoming everyone while protecting worshipers as they consider issues like legal liability and budget constraints. Legal experts advise congregations talk to an attorney and their insurance companies as they plan.
Churches using armed security have three options, said Knox County Sheriff's Office legal counsel Mike Ruble. Those choices are set by a Tennessee law, and the requirements surprised some church leaders at the seminars.
Congregations can hire private security forces or employ off-duty law enforcement. “If you put a police car outside your church on Sunday, that lets people know there is trained security,” Blair said.

Churches often hire off-duty officers for Sunday traffic control and security. Cost varies, but ranges from $90 to $120 for three to four hours in Blount or Knox counties. Officers said more East Tennessee churches have inquired about hiring officers since the Texas shooting.
A church also can form its own team of armed and non-armed members. A church employing members as security must be certified as a proprietary security organization with the state of Tennessee. The fee is $300.
Each person, armed or not, on the church security team must complete a set course of training. Cost varies but can be $200 for 16 required hours of armed guard instruction.
'Faith over fear' at TVUUC
At Knoxville's Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church, gun violence isn't a "what if." It's what happened.
A gunman killed two people at TVUUC before being tackled by churchgoers on July 27, 2008. Jim David Adkisson pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and was sentenced to life in prison.

Senior minister the Rev. Chris Buice is reluctant to detail TVUUC's post-shooting security. Measures include locking all but one door for services and asking staff and members to be vigilant. The church employs armed security for special events.
Buice said TVUUC worked with law enforcement for advice on church safety, something he recommends for other houses of worship.
"It's easy to become guarded and cautious and forget that the whole mission of a church is about welcoming. It's important to remember why are we here and how do we keep this a safe place and be true to what we are," Buice said.
"It's about being grounded in faith not about living in fear."
'A spiritual battle'

Church leaders say protecting members isn't always about guns. It's also about alertness and, sometimes, ministering. Domestic disputes and child custody issues can follow people through church doors.

“We have a unique balance — to love God and to love people, but we have to protect our (church) body as it gathers and studies the world and worships together. We don't want people to have to look over their shoulders," said the Rev. Keith Johnson, East Maryville Baptist's senior pastor. That church's in-house security team includes armed and unarmed members.
“We understand that the battle we are in is a spiritual battle," Johnson said. "We can't necessarily deal with evil except with force. And we believe that our first obligation is to protect our church family."

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - Alabama lawmakers are headed into the final days of the 2018 session with key votes looming on proposals to allow some teachers to carry guns in school, changing the position of lieutenant governor and other bills.
The House of Representatives on Tuesday will debate a bill to allow designated teachers, after undergoing training, to carry firearms in schools. The proposal is one of several bills introduced after the fatal shooting of 17 people at a Florida high school.
Other bills that could see action include proposals to: change the lieutenant governor's duties; reform the juvenile justice system; and reduce the number of weeks of unemployment compensation.
The final meeting days will bring a flurry of work as lawmakers push to get bills approved before a target March 29 adjournment date.

Virginia Tech coach Justin Fuente named redshirt freshman Josh Jackson the Hokies' starting quarterback Monday.
Jackson had emerged as the favorite to replace Jerod Evans, and coaches said he started separating from A.J. Bush and Hendon Hooker over the past two or three practices.
"I think the biggest thing is he is very consistent," Fuente told reporters in Blacksburg, Virginia. "He has been able to deliver the ball on time."
Though he hasn't played in a game, Jackson is the most experienced player on the roster when it comes to learning the Hokies' offensive system.
Jackson, son of former Michigan running backs coach Fred Jackson, sat behind Evans last year and was able to watch, learn and pick up the new scheme Fuente brought in with him.
Offensive coordinator Brad Cornelsen told reporters Jackson emerged as the leader for a few reasons, including his understanding of the offense.
"His ability to get out there play after play and do what he's supposed to do and protecting the football, he showed us that's really important to him," Cornelsen said. "All three of those kids have really good skill sets and they're all a little bit different. Josh is a little bit of all of it. He can sit in the pocket and throw, he can run the ball. Ultimately it comes back to him making good decisions."
Virginia Tech will open its 2017 season on Sept. 3 against West Virginia (7:30 p.m. ET, ABC) at FedExField in Landover, Maryland.
Veteran action and horror film producer Lati Grobman, also a two-time Emmy-nominated documentary producer, has substantially upgraded her residential circumstances with the $6.8 million purchase of a brand-new, spec-built residence in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles. Designed by L.A.-based architect Ken Ungar and described in marketing materials as a “contemporary farmhouse,” the board-and-batten-clad and stone-accented residence sits on more than one-third of an acre with five bedrooms and five full and two half bathrooms in about 6,500 square feet.
A slender, double-height center-hall entry is flanked by formal living and dining rooms, the former with an unexpectedly minimalist, smooth-concrete fireplace and the latter with a walk-in wine cellar. Ashy-brown hardwoods flow from public entertaining spaces to spacious family quarters that run along the rear and include a family room with wet bar, stone-faced fireplace and wide bank of glass panels that slip into the walls to merge the space with the backyard.
An office and an en suite bedroom are tucked discreetly behind the kitchen. There are three more family bedrooms on the upper floor along with a second family room and a master suite replete with wood-faced fireplace, fitted walk-in closet and bathroom with twin vanities, two-person soaking tub and steam shower. Nestled into a thickly treed slope, the grassy backyard includes a swimming pool and spa, an outdoor kitchen and a fire pit.

KKR wanted me to continue the way I played in the World Cup and carry on the momentum, says Shubman Gill
Sportskeeda caught up with Shubman Gill in an exclusive chat and discussed various issues.
One of the heroes of the 2018 under-19 World Cup was Indian batsman Shubman Gill, who scored as many as he scored 372 runs in five innings at an average of 124 and a strike-rate of 112.38 with the help of three fifties and a century and deservedly, was adjudged the Player of the Tournament.
During the World Cup, Shubman was bought by Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL auction for 1.8 crores and was expected to play a key role in the Knights' campaign.
As expected, Shubman played almost all the matches and fared well with the bat as he scored 203 runs in 11 innings at an average of more than 33 and a strike-rate of 146. After tasting success in his maiden IPL season, the right-hander will have his task cut-out as he has been named in the India A side for the tour of England.
Sportskeeda caught up with Shubman Gill in an exclusive chat and discussed various issues. Here are the excerpts.
Q: How was the feeling when you got to know that you are going to make your IPL debut?
During the IPL auction, I was in New Zealand and I got a lot of messages about my selection in the Kolkata Knight Riders squad. Rahul Dravid sir asked us to focus just on the World Cup. And when I got to know that I will be featuring in the playing XI, I was so happy. I was very excited to play in front of such huge crowds.
Q: You are basically a top-order batsman and in the IPL, you batted at number six and at times, at seven. Were you ready for the challenge? Is there any particular position where you prefer to bat in T20s?
No, it was up to the team management. I was ready to bat wherever the team wanted me to bat. They told me that I am going bat down the order well in advance and it helped me a lot in getting the right mindset to face the challenges.
Q: How did you go about your batting in the IPL? Were you happy with your performance?
Before my first game, the team management told me to keep things simple, enjoy my shots, continue the way I played in the World Cup and carry on the momentum. I just did that and I am so happy with my performance in the IPL. However, I need to work on a few things. What I feel is that I need to hit some big shots more frequently and if I keep working on it, things will take care of themselves.
Q: How was it to work under a captain, who is as experienced as Dinesh Karthik?
DK bhai is a very good captain and is very supportive. Right from day one, he encouraged me and that helped me a lot when I went out to bat in the middle.
Q: How was it score to your maiden IPL fifty against a side like Chennai Super Kings?
It was one of those normal games for me. There was nothing special. I just went out to bat with a clear mind and didn't think about what's going to happen. I just wanted to treat the ball on its merit. I was very happy for scoring my maiden IPL fifty and taking my team home.
Q: What is the biggest takeaway for you from the 2018 IPL?
The experience I got over the past two months, especially when I was batting outside my comfort zone, has been very valuable and is the biggest takeaway for me from the IPL.
Q: You have been named in the India A side for the tour of England. How are the preparations going? Any expectations?
Expectations as such, I just want to do well for the team. I am looking forward to enjoying myself whenever I go out to bat and score runs for my team. On my preparations, hmmm, thankfully things are going well for me. I don't want to complicate things too much.
Q: Any words on your under-19 teammates did well in the IPL?
All of them are really good players. This batch is very talented and all of them (Prithvi Shaw, Shivam Mavi, Abhishek Sharma and even Mujeeb ur Rahman, who played for Afghanistan) have played really well in the IPL. It is always to see the young players perform well. And yeah, I wish them good luck for their future.
Josh Murray and Amanda Stanton fell in love on Bachelor in Paradise this past summer, and they seemed like the perfect couple. They got engaged on the big season finale. Josh immediately moved to California to live with her and her daughters, but now sources are saying that these two have split. Us Magazine shared that even though Josh is back in Atlanta the two saw each other recently. They were spotted together on December 28 just a few weeks after multiple sources had confirmed the two were over. Josh and Amanda posed for a pic with a fan at a Free People clothing store in the Lenox Square mall. The reports have been that Amanda Stanton and Josh Murray would be appearing on the big Bachelor special that aired on Sunday night. This was a big preview for Nick Viall's new season, and they did air several updates from couples. The thing is Josh Murray and Amanda Stanton never showed up on the special. They didn't give any updates at all, and now the fans are curious what is going on with them. Carly Waddell and Evan Bass did give an update, and it looks like these two are the only couple from this season of Bachelor in Paradise that are going to last. my sis just met josh and amanda from “bachelor in paradise” and i'm more jealous than if she met beyoncé tbh. i am trash. pic.twitter.com/QsqYIk0KvS — johnmark conklin (@JMC289) December 29, 2016 On Monday, January 2, Nick Vialls' season of The Bachelor will start airing. This should be an entire show about Nick, and there is no reason that there would be updates from Josh and Amanda on this episode. It really does look like they are going to stay quiet about it for a bit. Maybe this couple thinks that they can work it out and just aren't ready to share with the fans yet. Josh Murray did recently have to put his dog Sabel to sleep, and he is heartbroken over it. Josh posted on his Twitter today saying, “Heading into 2017 without my best friend – but I am so thankful for everyone's prayers and love, it means the world to me. Happy New Year.” Josh is still not mentioning Amanda at all. The last post that Josh made about her was on December 16 and was commenting about how he would always love her little girl. Bustle shared their thoughts on if Josh and Amanda are together or not. They really feel like the fact that Josh and Amanda didn't give an update tonight means that they are trying to work it out. That is the only real explanation that makes sense at this point. Right now, this couple is the only one that knows the real truth about what is going on with them. Back to paradise? Josh Murray and Amanda Stanton were spotted together again: https://t.co/x7VTs5IKSd #BachelorInParadise pic.twitter.com/vlAuqp7nPq — Us Weekly (@usweekly) December 31, 2016 Reality Steve shared a few details on his blog about what is going on with Josh and Amanda.

* Appoints acting chairman Malcolm Le ‎May as its CEO
* Le ‎May fills a position vacant since August
* Says home credit arm makes “good operational progress”
* Shares jump 4.5 pct (Adds details, analyst comments, share movement)
By Noor Zainab Hussain
Feb 2 (Reuters) - Troubled Provident Financial has appointed acting chairman Malcolm Le ‎May as its CEO with immediate effect, it said on Friday, giving him the challenge of reviving its door-to-door lending operations.
Le ‎May, appointed to Provident's board in 2014, fills a position that has been vacant since August when a second profit warning in quick succession prompted the departure of CEO Peter Crook and suspension of its dividend.
The British sub-prime lender has been trying to reorganise a business that has traditionally relied on self-employed agents offering high-interest loans of between 100 and 1,000 pounds and collecting repayment through weekly household visits.
But it had been unable to recruit enough people for its plan to replace external agents with direct employees.
The company, which was founded in 1880 and provided loans through the Wall Street crash of 1929 and both world wars, also faces investigations by Britain's financial watchdog into two of its businesses.
Provident, which is worth about 988 million pounds, lost almost 70 percent of its value last year. Its shares were trading 4.5 percent higher at 700 pence at 0911 GMT, the second biggest gainers on the FTSE Midcap index.
“We were expecting and hoping to see an external appointment, to bring a fresh perspective and recovery strategy. That said, this news is likely to lead a relief rally,” Liberum analyst Justin Bates, who rates provident as “sell”, said.
Le May said that his key objective was to turn around the group.
He has previously worked at Barclays and UBS and took over as Provident's acting chair after the sudden death in November of former investment banker Manjit Wolstenholme.
The company said its home credit arm “continued to make good operational progress” and that talks continue with the Financial Conduct Authority relating to investigations of its Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn businesses.
“The statement says nothing to suggest that a cash call will not be necessary and, anecdotally, we hear that attrition trends are challenging,” Goodbody analyst John Cronin said.
“We do not believe that today's positive news is sufficiently strong to drive a substantial unwind of short positions and investors have good reason to remain cautious.”
Fourteen hedge funds were still betting on Provident's share price to fall further as of Thursday, according to disclosures with the British regulator. ($1 = 0.7014 pounds)

Come home quickly, she begged. “The building is on fire!” she said.A few minutes later, the 22-year-old biomedical engineering student rounded the corner to see Grenfell Tower transforming into an inferno. “As soon as I arrived, someone pointed and said, ‘Someone is jumping! Someone is jumping!'” he recounted on Wednesday with the smell of smoke lingering in the air. He estimated the person jumped from the 16th or 17th floor of the 24-floor tower. That kind of fall is not the kind you can survive. The number of dead touched at least 12 — with dozens more injured and authorities warning the death toll could rise.

Milwaukee citizens are starting to take notice of the dangers of a local intersection, as a rally was held at the intersection of W. Capitol Drive and N. 35th St. Monday afternoon. The goal of the rally was simple: urge drivers to slow down and take caution when driving near the intersection. The intersection was recently labeled the most dangerous intersection in Wisconsin by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The rally was organized by the Northwest Side Community Development Corporation after Common Council President Ashanti Hamilton and Ald. Khalif Rainey called on the city and state to make streets safer for everyone. Picketers lined the intersection, holding signs that said “Slow Down,” and “We Want Action.”
“We want to expand the Rally Pushes for Safer Streets conversation to include design changes to make intersections like this one safer,” said Alderman Rainey in a press release. “The public's safety and welfare must be our top priority and I intend to push for greater safety along W. Capitol Dr. and across my district.”
Sarah Bregant, the Community Development Specialist for the NWSCDC, helped organize the rally to build grassroots support for this issue.
“Traffic deaths are not acceptable,” she said. “We want to make streets safer. There are neighbors who live nearby who want a safer way to cross the street and who want people to slow down.”
There has been more than 20 reported incidents in or around this intersection so far in 2018, according to a crash map provided by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. Andrew Haug, the Resource Development Manager at NWSCDC, believes this number is far too high.
“We are hearing this concern all across the city. This neighborhood needs to be safe for everyone. If we can reach a few people today and urge them to drive safer, maybe we can save some lives,” Haug said in an interview.
Organizers are urging concerned citizens to sign the Milwaukee Complete Streets for All petition. The petition began as a way to create a “policy that makes our neighborhoods better for walking and biking for people of all ages and abilities,” according to their website, which can be found at bfw.org/advocacy/completestreets.
2019 Jaguar I-Pace first drive Enlarge Photo
Jaguar product planning boss Hanno Kirner believes the instant torque and power found in a hypothetical I-Pace SVR could be too much for untrained drivers. While he stopped short of confirming a high-performance version of the electric crossover, he made it clear such a vehicle is on the table.
Kirner told Autocar in a Tuesday report that an I-Pace SVR would likely be capable of reaching 60 mph in 1.8 seconds, but engineers also want to prioritize handling—not just headline-grabbing specs.
"Once you've done it once or twice, and lost your eyes in the back of their sockets, you might not want to do it again," he said.
Tesla has already made plenty of headlines in recent years for offering hypercar levels of acceleration with the Model S and Model X electric cars. The 2020 Tesla Roadster will also allegedly reach 60 mph in 1.9 seconds.
The product planning chief envisioned some sort of power restriction for a potential I-Pace SVR. Kirner said the vehicle could reduce power for a driver until he/she has attended a driving course or some other instruction. Although Jaguar hasn't committed to such a model, the brand's top brass certainly do like to talk about the idea of one.
Last March, Kirner first expressed interest in building an I-Pace performance variant. At that time, he also said there remains a possibility for other I-Pace models, including an off-road or more luxurious version. Kirner echoed the sentiment in the latest Autocar report.
"There is probably more than one route we could take," he said. "But there is definitely space for a performance electric car or cars."
John Edwards, head of Jaguar Land Rover's personalization and performance arm, also hinted earlier this year that Jaguar will eventually develop a full range of performance-oriented electric cars.
The British luxury brand will also take the I-Pace racing in its own one-make series held before Formula E open-wheel electric-car races.
Now that we've finally gotten out of 2016, we find ourselves left with a lot of loose ends.
That was a tumultuous year both on and off TV, but 2017 could very well be full of promise…

New appointment in PASHA Bank's Turkish subsidiary
2017-10-06 17:19 | www.trend.az | 0
Baku, Azerbaijan, Oct. 6
By Anvar Mammadov – Trend:
Ugur Koc has been appointed deputy director general of PASHA Yatirim Bankasi AS, a subsidiary of Azerbaijan's PASHA Bank OJSC in Turkey, the subsidiary's website said.
Thus, the number of deputies of Cenk Eynehan, director general of PASHA Yatirim Bankasi, has reached three. In addition to Ugur Koc, Ali Ihsan Tokkuzun and Ayse Hale Yildirim are also deputy directors general at PASHA Yatirim Bankasi.
Turkey's Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK) approved PASHA Bank's purchasing a 79.9 percent share in TAIB Bank, which was renamed to PASHA Yatirim Bankasi, on Dec. 29, 2014. Later, PASHA Bank increased its stake to 99.9 percent.
PASHA Bank is a leading corporate bank in Azerbaijan. The bank, founded in 2007, renders a range of corporate banking services, including issuance of loans, operations in the securities market, assets management, and treasury services.

Pakistan on Monday celebrated 70 years of independence from British India with a patriotic display including a giant flag and a show of airpower, as the military's top brass vowed to wipe out terrorists hours before a new bomb attack killed six soldiers.
Celebrations began at the stroke of midnight with firework shows in major cities.
At the highly symbolic Wagah eastern border crossing with India, army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa raised a massive national flag on a 400 foot (122-metre) pole as crowds chanted patriotic slogans.
Following the chest-thumping performance Bajwa said the country was making progress and promised to "go after each and every terrorist in Pakistan".

"We have made a few mistakes in the past, but we are on the road to development under the guidance of our constitution," he added.
Later Monday a roadside bomb in restive Balochistan province's Harnai district killed six paramilitary soldiers and wounded two others, a spokesman for the troops said. The separatist Baluch Liberation Army claimed responsibility in a telephone call to AFP.
The attack came days after a powerful bomb targeted a military vehicle in the provincial capital Quetta late Saturday, killing 14 people including several troops.
The military later said the blast, claimed by the Islamic State group, was intended to mar independence day celebrations.
Lahore: Pakistani ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif arrives at the tomb of Pakistan's national poet Allama Mohammad Iqbal to Independence Day
Pakistan also faces fresh political turmoil after the Supreme Court last month sacked Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif following an investigation into corruption allegations against his family.
In Islamabad his newly-elected successor Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, along with top generals and foreign dignitaries, presided over a 31-gun salute and flag-raising ceremony to mark the holiday.
"The independence that we got 70 years ago was the fruit of the exemplary struggle of our ancestors," said Abbasi in an address to the nation.
"Thousands of Muslims have made sacrifices for our future and the future of our children."
Further south in Karachi the day began with a changing of the guard at the mausoleum of the country's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah, where politicians and military commanders laid floral wreaths.
'Long live Pakistan'
The skies above the capital were later streaked with multicoloured smoke as the air force hosted Pakistan's largest air show to date.
Fighter jets criss-crossed over the leafy capital in aerobatic manoeuvres as thousands packed shoulder-to-shoulder applauded from a park below. Planes from close allies Saudi Arabia and Turkey also took part.
In Lahore students cruised through the eastern city's streets on motorbikes waving flags and screaming "Long live Pakistan!"
Up north in the Swat valley near the restive border with Afghanistan celebrations were more subdued, with events at schools cancelled due to "prevailing law and order" issues.
In nearby Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Christians held special services at a church and freed doves to mark the holiday.
"Four years back my father and brother died in this church in a suicide attack, but I am still here praying for my beloved country," schoolteacher Neelam Anwar told AFP.
In August 1947 the British Raj was dismantled with the subcontinent divided into two independent states -- Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.

Millions were uprooted in one of the largest mass migrations in history, with experts estimating at least one million died in the communal violence unleashed by partition.
The carnage sowed the seeds of the acrimony that led to three wars, and generations later this defining moment in the subcontinent's history is still polarised by nationalism and rancour.
The countries still wrangle over a large part of their shared border, especially in disputed Kashmir. They even recognise their independence from British rule on separate days, with Pakistan claiming August 14 and India celebrating the following day.
If there was a federal agency that Barack Obama did not corrupt, it must be because it was corrupt when he took over in 2009. The corruption of the IRS is a case in point. Its criminal misconduct perfectly represents what Obama wrought in the agencies that he charged with dictating the way we live. Consider the case of Lori Lowenthal Marcus and Z Street.
Z Street is Lori's pro-Israel group. It had its application for tax-exempt status held up at the IRS for seven years. When Lori asked why, she was told that IRS auditors had been instructed to give pro-Israel groups special attention and that Z Street's application had been forwarded to a special IRS unit for additional review. Not to put too fine a point on the legal issues, this wasn't kosher. It's illegal.
Z Street filed a lawsuit against the IRS in the rosy dawn of the Age of Obama. Alana Goodman (then with the Washington Free Beacon) wrote about the lawsuit here in 2013 when the District of Columbia District Court denied the IRS motion to dismiss the case. Lori wrote about it here. John Hinderaker wrote about it on Power Line in 2013 in the post “The other IRS scandal.”
The IRS sought to have the case dismissed for failure to state a claim and then asserted ludicrous defenses. With its friends in the Obama Department of Justice, the IRS did whatever it could to preclude, protract and obstruct discovery until President Obama and the malefactors serving at his pleasure moved on. The case is a sidebar to the political corruption of the IRS that remains one of the open sores of the Age of Obama.
The IRS appealed the denial of its motion to dismiss to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. A panel of three judges heard the IRS appeal. The hearing did not go well for the IRS. Indeed, it was an exercise in righteous humiliation of the Department of Justice. The Wall Street Journal took a look at the hearing in the reported editorial “The IRS goes to court” (behind the Journal's paywall).
Working with unusual swiftness, the DC Circuit handed down its opinion in 2015. The court unanimously rejected the arguments advanced by the IRS. The court's opinion is accessible online here.
The court's ruling left Z Street free to pursue its claim and conduct discovery. Z Street looked forward to learning the nature and origin of the “Israel Special Policy” which the IRS applied to Z Street's application, who created it, who approved it, and to whom it was applied.
A series of IRS documents called “Be On the LookOut” lists released by Congress in June 2013, pursuant to the TIGTA investigation) had already established that, as Z STREET alleged, while Z STREET's application for tax exempt status was pending, the IRS had indeed unlawfully created a special category of review for organizations seeking such status, if they were engaged in what the IRS called “occupied territory advocacy.”
This week the Department of Justice settled Lori's lawsuit. The department has announced the settlement here. I have posted the consent order signed by the department below via Scribd. Lori tells the story herself in the Wall Street Journal column “The IRS campaign against Israel — and us” (behind the Journal's paywall). Lori writes:
Now we know the truth, and it's exactly as bad as we thought. IRS documents—those they didn't “lose” or otherwise fail to produce—reveal the following: • Our application was flagged because Z Street's mission related to Israel, a country with terrorism. Therefore, an IRS manager in our case said in sworn testimony, the IRS needed to investigate whether Z Street was funding terror. • Some applications for tax-exempt status were indeed being sent to IRS headquarters in Washington for more intense scrutiny. They were selected because of the applicants' viewpoint. • In August 2010, three other Jewish organizations applying for tax-exempt status were asked by the IRS to “explain their religious beliefs about the Land of Israel.”
Here are the concluding paragraphs of her column:
Within weeks of President Obama's inauguration, IRS and State Department officials began considering whether they could deny or revoke tax-exempt status for organizations that provided material support to Jews living across the Green Line—the nonborder that delineates pre-1967 Israel from the territories Israel acquired in the Six Day War. The theory was that a Jewish presence in those areas is inconsistent with U.S. policy. The IRS drew up lists of such organizations based on information from anti-Israel websites such as Electronic Intifada and MondoWeiss. The New York Times and the Washington Post ran articles that advanced the policy espoused by the Obama administration and its nonprofit ally, J Street. Unnamed “senior State Department officials” were quoted as saying that Jewish activity over the Green Line isn't “helpful” to peace efforts. While no formal policy was released barring U.S. tax-exempt entities from supporting Jewish activity over the Green Line, Obama IRS officials tried three times between 2009 and 2012 to create such a policy, and IRS employees made sure the effort wasn't documented. One emailed her supervisor saying that she would answer his questions about IRS policy relating to Israeli settlements only orally. “Not doing email on this,” she explained. Even if the IRS could legitimately institute such a policy, it should not have applied to Z Street. We believe Jews should be allowed to live beyond the Green Line, but we have never spent a penny outside the U.S. To learn the truth, we fought in the courts for seven lonely years—defeating IRS arguments that it didn't have to obey the First Amendment, that it was immune from the suit, and that it wasn't obliged to produce in discovery any documents revealing why its employees did what they did. During the seven years Z Street's application was frozen, it couldn't raise funds. If my husband and I weren't lawyers, able to pursue justice without getting paid, there's no way we could have succeeded. When Z Street's creation was announced, thousands sought to join. Then the IRS attempted to kill us. No lawsuit can remedy that assault, as the IRS knew. The settlement gives us the truth, but we can't get back our seven years.
I wrote Lori yesterday to ask if she wanted to add anything. Lori responded:
One of the almost entirely unnoticed points is that because we sued the IRS, it used a purely discretionary regulation to freeze our application for five years. This was the case even though that regulation applied to organizations which sued over their tax-exempt status and our case was officially determined by the trial court and the appellate court NOT to be about our status but about the unconstitutional process the IRS used to even consider our application. The IRS BOLO list category of “Occupied Territory Advocacy” described organizations therein as having to do with “disputed territories.” The IRS then tried to claim that all the organizations in that category were anti-Israel organizations. Is there an anti-Israel organization in the world that refers to Judea and Samaria as “disputed territories”? No. They always, always use either West Bank, Occupied Palestine, or Occupied Territories. It's clear they created the category based on our organization, and yet the memo dated August 6, 2010, that created the category was “lost.” That category appeared on 4 or 5 BOLO lists, presumably all IRS agents involved in processing applications had access to it and yet…POOF! It's unobtainable.
Lori has written more to fill out the story on her Z Street site. The settlement of the case short of the administration of punishment to responsible officials leaves a deeply bitter aftertaste.

With Paul George off to Oklahoma City, Myles Turner will look to become the next star for the Indiana Pacers and his NBA 2K squad. Photo: Joe Robbins/Getty Images
The Indiana Pacers don't have a potential franchise star this year, so who will top their virtual NBA 2K ratings this year?
The Starting Five
Myles Turner: NBA 2K17 rating - 78
Turner had a great season with the Pacers in only his second full campaign. This season will really be a test for him as he potentially takes the reigns as the star player from departing Paul George. His rating should go up this year, and I expect it to be 84 as it was announced on #2KFirstLook.
Thaddeus Young: NBA 2K17 rating - 79
Young featured 74 times in the regular season for the Pacers but had a pretty average season compared to his times at Philadelphia and Brooklyn. His rating will probably stay at around 79.
Bojan Bogdanovic: NBA 2K17 rating - 76
Bogdanovic left the Washington Wizards at the end of the season and signed for the Pacers during the free agency period. He failed to start a game in Washington, which could push his rating down to around 74.
Victor Oladipo: NBA 2K17 rating - 79
Alongside MVP Russell Westbrook, Oladipo featured 67 for Oklahoma City Thunder last season and recorded career highs in field goal and three point percentages. His rating should rise to become Pacers best guard at 80.
Cory Joseph: NBA 2K17 rating - 75
Joseph featured predominantly from the bench in Toronto, behind Kyle Lowry, but will be fighting for a starting place in Indiana. His career high in points should see his rating increase slightly to around 76.

The Best of the Rest
Glenn Robinson III: NBA 2K17 rating - 70
His rating has recently been confirmed from #2KFirstLook as 74.
Darren Collison: NBA 2K17 rating - 77
From Sacramento to Indiana, Collison will also be looking for a starting position. His rating will probably drop to 76.
Al Jefferson: NBA 2K17 rating - 79
Jefferson's rating has continued to drop since NBA 2K15, where he was rated at 87. After only starting once last year, his rating will drop again to around 76.
Domantas Sabonis: NBA 2K17 rating - 71
The Lithuanian forward will look to show some of his college potential in Indiana this year, after leaving Oklahoma. His rating will stay at 71.
Aaron Brooks: NBA 2K17 rating - 73
Brooks will again feature from the bench, his rating my drop slightly to 72.
Lance Stephenson: NBA 2K17 rating - 74
After joining Pacers late last season, Stephenson will continue his second stint in Indiana until 2018. His rating will plateau at 74.
The Rookies
T.J. Leaf
The 18th pick of the draft went to the Pacers and they chose T.J. Leaf. 2K doesn't tend to be too generous with rookies in the game unless they were drafted No. 1 or 2 overall. Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball is rated at 80 but Leaf will probably be around 69.

Edmond Sumner
With the possibility of being a reserve, Sumner's rating could be as low as 65.
Ike Anigbogu
A knee injury hindered Anigbogu's selection to be a projected first round pick but was eventually selected by the Pacers after impressing during workouts. His rating will probably be around 66.
In the final days of Barack Obama's presidency, the warmongers in Washington, DC are hell-bent on causing as much chaos as possible. If they don't manage to start a war with Russia before Donald Trump is sworn in, it won't be for lack of trying.
The Military Industrial Complex stands to profit by billions of dollars if this comes to fruition. War is very profitable for politicians and their corporate cronies, but for the rest of us, it would inflict a heavy toll. (If you haven't read it yet, I strongly recommend picking up a copy of the anti-war classic, War Is a Racket by General Smedley Butler.)
Today, 35 Russian diplomats were expelled from the US for their alleged part in tampering with the election:
The US has expelled 35 Russian diplomats as punishment for alleged interference into the presidential election. It will also close two Russian compounds used for intelligence-gathering, in Maryland and New York, as part of a raft of retaliatory measures. President Barack Obama had vowed action against Russia amid US accusations it directed hacks against the Democratic party and Hillary Clinton's campaign. Russia has denied any involvement. The US State Department declared the 35 Russian diplomats from the Washington DC embassy and the consulate in San Francisco “persona non grata”, giving them and their families 72 hours to leave the US. The Russian government is expected to respond in turn by expelling US diplomats. Sanctions have also been announced against nine entities and individuals including the GRU and FSB Russian intelligence agencies.
Two Republicans, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and a Democrat, Amy Klobuchar, all voiced their support for action to be taken against Russia for “meddling with the presidential election” in November. The three are currently stirring up trouble on a tour of NATO countries near Russia's western border.
McCain, Graham, and Klobuchar are claiming that there is support from 99% of both Republicans and Democrats for actions against Russia, and particularly against Vladimir Putin personally.
Speaking to CNN, Graham said:
“There are 100 United States senators. Amy Klobuchar is on this trip with us. She's a Democrat from Minnesota. I would say that 99 of us believe the Russians did this and we're going to do something about it,” said Graham, who is planning a hearing with McCain on Russia's interference with US elections. “We're going to put sanctions together that hit Putin as an individual and his inner circle for interfering in our election, and they're doing it all over the world — not just in the United States.”
The claims of Russian interference were brought forth by the CIA, but are unsubstantiated. The FBI rebuts the CIA's claim and says there is no evidence to support that Russia tinkered with the election. President-Elect Donald Trump called claims of Russian interference “ridiculous.”
Russia will not take this lying down.
If the three members of Congress are successful in stirring up conflict, Russia has said they will take action against the US.
Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova responded in a statement: “If Washington really does take new hostile steps, they will be answered. “Any action against Russian diplomatic missions in the US will immediately bounce back on US diplomats in Russia.”(source)
The European Union still has sanctions in place against Russia for its 2014 annexation of the Crimea peninsula. Those sanctions target arms exporters, banks, and any individuals the EU blames for the invasion of Ukraine. According to the EU talking heads, the sanctions have exacted a hard economic toll on Russia, but the Russian government denies this emphatically.
The current crew in DC seem intent on creating as many problems as they can for President-Elect Trump to inherit.
Should we be worried about the Russians or our own government?
As an un-named source told the BBC:
“These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction”.
When Lindsey Graham accuses the Russians of interfering around the world, it sounds a bit like the pot calling the kettle black, don't you think?
The US government seems to believe that they have the right to step into any arena they choose and that the world at large must accept it. But at the same time, they lecture other nations and impose sanctions, even when there is no proof of wrong-doing.
You have to wonder what else is planned for the last 21 days before Trump takes office.

The Los Angeles Chargers' receiving corps has been getting all the praise from the Chargers' coaches during this week's minicamp.
The wide receivers should be one of the strengths of this year's football team as they have the explosive Chargers wide receivers Travis Benjamin, Keenan Allen returning from injury, highly touted Mike Williams and rising star Tyrell Williams.
On paper, the Chargers have the potential to be an elite group with Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers in charge.
Fortunately, it seems that the group is performing well, for they are not satisfied and are attacking this offseason, per the Chargers' official Twitter account.
Whisenhunt says young receivers have looked good. Cites Tyrell Williams as someone who took advantage of opportunity when he had it. — Los Angeles Chargers (@Chargers) June 14, 2017
Lynn mentioned seeing vertical speed of @TravisBenjamin3 has been really nice. — Los Angeles Chargers (@Chargers) June 14, 2017
Los Angeles knows that Williams and Allen will be great if healthy. Therefore, Bolt Nation should not be worried as their talent is never in question.
However, the question marks revolve around Benjamin and Tyrell. They are the guys that will decide how effective the receiving corps will be.
Related 5 things to watch for at Chargers minicamp
Allen and Williams will lock down the No. 1 and No. 2 positions, but the best teams have great players from No. 1 to No. 4.
If the Chargers coaches are correct when speaking about Benjamin and Tyrell, then Los Angeles will have the needed star talent and depth to make other NFL secondaries worried.
Especially when there is a future Hall of Fame quarterback throwing them the ball.

* Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2DSvXTy
By John Kemp
LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production topped 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in November, according to monthly estimates published by the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.
Crude output was the highest in 47 years and just 6,000 bpd below the record set in November 1970 (“Petroleum Supply Monthly”, EIA, Jan. 31).
Production has doubled over the last 10 years, from a low of around 5 million bpd in 2007, reversing decades of decline since the 1970s.
The most recent surge in output confounded some observers, who had forecast production was about to level off, though the EIA had predicted it for some time.
Crude production increased by almost 850,000 bpd in just the three months to November, according to the EIA.
Nearly all the recent surge has come from the lower 48 states excluding federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico (tmsnrt.rs/2DSvXTy).
Most of that increase has come from onshore shale plays in Texas (where output has risen by 500,000 bpd since August) and North Dakota (where output is up by more than 100,000 bpd).
Production from the lower 48 excluding the Gulf of Mexico hit almost 7.9 million bpd in November, easily beating the previous peak of nearly 7.8 million bpd in March 2015.
From an output perspective, the U.S. shale sector has fully recovered from the price and output slump that started in 2014 and 2015.
Production has beaten its previous peak even though there are fewer than half the number of rigs drilling for oil compared with before the slump.
Producers have pulled back from marginal areas to the most productive “core” parts of shale plays such as the Permian in western Texas and eastern New Mexico.
Smaller, older rigs have been idled or replaced by newer, larger and more powerful equipment that can bore through rock faster and further.
Rigs are increasingly drilling multiple wells from a single pad (avoiding downtime for moving in and rigging up) and individual wells have much longer horizontal sections (exposing more rock to each well).
The result is that more oil is being produced with far fewer rigs and drilling teams.
DYNAMICS
Experience shows that rig counts generally follow changes in benchmark West Texas Intermediate futures prices with a lag of around four months.
In turn, production tends to follow changes in the rig count with a lag of up to six months, to allow for delays in completing wells and hooking them up to gathering systems.
So the total lag from a change in prices to a change in production can be six to 12 months especially once delays in reporting are taken into account.
WTI prices have been on an upward trend since February 2016. The rig count has been rising since June 2016. And lower 48 production has been increasing since December 2016.
The timeline is consistent with previous patterns for cyclical changes in prices, drilling and production.
Understanding the lags in the system between prices, drilling and production is absolutely critical to making sense of the data.
More recently, the rig count has been flat or lower since August 2017, which is why some analysts predicted output would also level off.
But the frenzied drilling activity in the second half of 2016 and especially in the first half of 2017 led to the build-up of a large number of wells that had been drilled but not yet completed.
As more of these wells have been completed and oil started to flow, production has surged even as the rig count has remained flat.
New completions of wells drilled earlier in 2017 should continue boosting production throughout the first half of 2018.
In recent months, WTI prices have climbed higher and the rig count has also started to turn up again, which should boost production in the second half of 2018.
The more oil prices rise, the bigger the eventual response from the shale drillers will be – which is why OPEC and its allies need to start planning an exit strategy from production cuts before they become self-defeating.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has two proposals on how to secure a frictionless border with EU member Ireland after Brexit, a new customs partnership or a “highly streamlined approach” to customs, Northern Ireland minister James Brokenshire said on Sunday.
“We set out two proposals in relation to how we would deal with the issue of tariffs, how we would deal with those sorts of elements in relation to customs whether that be a new customs partnership where we would effectively apply a similar or the same tariff that the EU currently applies to goods coming into the EU, or a highly streamlined approach with effectively exemptions that would apply for small business,” he told Sky News.
A train derailment has blocked the tracks between Peterborough and Ely.
All services have been cancelled between the two cities, and disruption on the line is expected for the rest of the day following the accident earlier today (Monday).
No-one was hurt in the incident, which saw a freight train come off the tracks.
Travellers hoping to get between Norwich and Peterborough are advised to travel via London, while replacement bus services have been requested.
A spokesman for the Rail Accident Investigation Branch said they were at the scene gathering evidence.

The Detroit Fire Department is mourning the loss of Raymond Birch Sr., 54, who died in his sleep at his Dearborn Heights home on Sunday.
Birch is a 21-year veteran of the fire department, and served as assistant chief of the fire department's EMS division.
Dave Fornell, deputy commissioner and spokesman for the department, described Birch as "a good guy and a good friend."
The former Marine will be buried at the Holly National Cemetery. Arrangements are being set.
Birch's death comes months after his recovery from hip surgery, which Fornell said he had "bounced back" from just fine.
"We're gobstruck right now," Fornell said. "This is very bad."

Multan
Former president of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Javed Hashmi and PTI Chairman Imran Khan on Sunday traded barbs after Hashmi on a TV show accused the ‘frustrated' PTI chief of planning to dissolve the government during the 2014 sit-in because he failed to win votes in the election.
Imran accused the veteran politician of lying. “What response can I give to Hashmi's jhoot plus?” he asked.
Hashmi alleged that “Disgruntled elements in the army wanted to make Raheel Sharif unsuccessful at any cost, and through Imran Khan, they wanted to destroy the parliament. A frustrated Imran Khan, because he didn't get votes.”
The former PTI leader alleged that party members asked if there had been rigging in Punjab during the election. “The parliamentary leader was Shah Mahmood Qureshi. Presiding over the parliamentary leaders, he said that there had been no rigging in Punjab. At most, in one or two constituencies,” Hashmi claimed.
“When we asked [during the 2014 sit-in] ‘Why hasn't the umpire raised his finger?', he [Imran] said we weren't able to deliver on the commitment we promised them, so how will it happen? All of this was being guided step-by-step by a written script,” he alleged.
“Our scriptwriters, whoever they were, wrote that Tahir-ul-Qadri would go to parliament and we [the PTI] would sit behind them. That was the main script… It was his [Imran's] second step to get everything done by the Supreme Court,” he claimed.
“Imran said [former Chief Justice of Pakistan] Tasadduq Jillani would leave and then Nasir-ul-Mulk would come. He would [listen to us] and either dissolve the assemblies. And after that, there would be elections in 90 days. During that time, he said, the Supreme Court will take over and then we [the PTI] will win,” Hashmi alleged.
“I said, Imran Khan, this is not how it happens. This sit-in will not be successful.”
“I was asked how many seats we would get in the election. I said 40, and we got about 37,” he said. “Now everyone's assessment was that we aren't winning seats. So if you're not winning, don't destroy the country because you're frustrated,” Hashmi said, referring to the PTI chief.
“I resigned because the Supreme Court's holidays were cancelled… This seemed like a very big conspiracy to me,” he said. “This seemed like the last item [on the script]. Because the generals had already told Imran Khan that Nawaz Sharif would not sign his resignation letter,” Hashmi claimed.
The veteran politician recalled when General Mahmood in 1999 asked Nawaz Sharif to sign his resignation letter, saying that the premier chose not to sign his resignation letter and told the general to kill him instead.
“This story about Nawaz was told to Imran by a man of Gen Rashid Qureshi's… It was his second step to get everything done by the Supreme Court.”
Hashmi also said he has always been against the strategy of the PTI's sit-ins. “It isn't the right strategy as it will only produce more struggle for the young political workers in your party,” he said, adding that he had warned Imran his party workers would struggle on the streets for five years without any outcome.
“Young people see things in black and white,” he said. “I am more experienced than he is in politics. I know what I am saying.”
Imran responded to Hashmi's allegations by implying the veteran politician had lost his senses and was lying.
“I think Javed Hashmi has reached the age where his mental state is not sound. What response can I give his madness, his jhoot plus?” he asked.
Hashmi, responding to Imran Khan's jibe at his age, said, “Imran Khan is only a year and a half younger than I am… A board should examine his mental state and mine too. Then it will be clear who is sharper.”
“If a mental health institution [tested us] and released a report, then the country would be free of Imran Khan… They will be surprised to learn what a liar he is.”
“I think there should be a commission. There has been such a big fraud with the people. I guarantee you, he will not dare to sit and say otherwise in front of me.”
In 2014, Javed Hashmi announced his resignation from the party presidency and its membership following suspension after allegations against Imran Khan, which party leadership said he had failed to explain.
Hashmi had said that he could no longer continue his membership with a party ‘conspiring' to dismantle democracy in Pakistan.
In a memorable speech to a joint session of Parliament in 2014, the seasoned politician had claimed that a system existed in the country “to engineer making and breaking of governments.” He made the claims shortly after disclosing “a scripted plan to overthrow the government, using violent protests as a pretext.”

Many were shocked to learn of another toddler drowning in faeces in a pit toilet last week. The resources to provide decent, dignified, healthy facilities are available. But the need to remedy these conditions meets with indifference. This is part of a broader problem where the good things of life and even necessities remain within reach of a few. By RAYMOND SUTTNER.
This article first appeared on Creamer Media's website: polity.org.za
“No parent, no matter how poor, should have to bury a five-year-old – a child that lay in faeces.” – Equal Education
This week we mark Human Rights Day, on the anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre of 1960. It comes in the wake of the second known death of a five-year-old child, Lumka Mketwa, found in a pit latrine in Bizana in the Eastern Cape, birthplace of Oliver Tambo. Michael Komape also drowned in faeces in a pit latrine in Limpopo, in 2014.
The death of at least two (for we do not know if all have been reported) five-year old children in pit toilets at schools is shameful. Many, many people fought long and hard to be able to protect all from the violence and atrocities of apartheid. Yet our state and society cannot protect these toddlers from danger and even death, death in most grim circumstance.
School and university education has expanded to open doors to many who would not previously have had the opportunity to enter. But that does not absolve government and educational authorities from ensuring the safety and dignified conditions of all learners, through the required infrastructure. There are basic norms that authorities are legally obliged to observe in relation to infrastructure in these schools and they are not being achieved, especially in the Eastern Cape. Regrettably, there are some loopholes in the norms that have been published and this has meant that legally obligatory targets have not been met due, inter alia, to various attempts to blame other departments for failure to join the efforts. (Further reading.)
In order to plug these holes, and to ensure compliance Equal Education (EE) has acted -as a social movement- organising communities to protest and sleep outside offices of the Department of Basic Education (DBE) and their provincial counterparts, especially in the Eastern Cape, where school infrastructure is the worst in the country. At the moment EE is engaged in litigation in order to tighten the enforcement of laws compelling the DBE to ensure that basic infrastructural norms (pitifully minimal as these are) are enforced. The DBE has had to be dragged to court on more than one occasion and it is interesting that even in opposing their obligations to provide this minimum compliance there is considerable insensitivity.
As Lumka Mketwa's death was being reported in the media, Equal Education was in court over the failure of the Department of Basic Education to observe the school infrastructural norms. This is a very delicate matter, for not only have children died, but learners and teachers spend days in undignified and unsafe conditions, often without any ablution facilities or inadequate or dirty ones, often without access to clean water or electricity. Many are learning in unsafe structures where classes are conducted, sometimes huge numbers in unsafe structures, with sometimes over 300 sharing one unclean pit toilet. (See statistics in Equal Education publications).
In these circumstances the language of counsel briefed by the state ought to be sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate awareness of the seriousness of the conditions, even if contesting the duty to fund remedies or attempting to escape responsibility on one or other legal or pseudo-legal ground. Instead, the advocate for the Department, Chris Erasmus, SC responded to Acting Judge Nomawabo Mzizi by saying that the Minister did not have “unlimited resources” to build “five-star schools.” “We submit that we can only do what the funds are available for and nothing beyond that.”
Whatever the merits of the legal argument being advanced, the reference to “five star” schools trivialises the character and meaning of having access to safe and decent conditions of schooling, which Erasmus and DBE officials would presumably expect for their own children. Even if a case is made for failure to provide decent conditions by frivolous references to what is claimed, one is revealing that the conditions under which Lumka Mketwa and Michael Komape died are regarded as what accords with the station in life occupied by the Komapes and the Mketwas of South Africa.
It is important that we remember that this did not start today, and the DBE undertook to achieve targets in terms of decent infrastructure by 2016 and failed dismally. We are now being told that parents must expect it to continue indefinitely. As for the availability of funds, in the Eastern Cape, some R 530m of the education budget went unspent and was returned to the Treasury, funding that could perhaps have saved young Lumka Mketwa's life.
But, regrettably, what happened this week with another death of a five- year-old, is part of a broader pattern of continued marginalisation of the poorest sections of South African society, the same people, mainly the African majority, who were marginalised under colonial and apartheid conditions of oppression, the people in whose name the liberation struggle was waged. We are concerned at this moment with education, but in reality, apartheid conditions of oppression against the poor, those who work and those without jobs, those with land and those without land, those with homes and the homeless -who are mainly Africans, continue in various ways.
We are concerned at this moment with a death of a five-year-old that was not an accident, but a loss of life that could have been avoided had resources been directed with a sense of ethical responsibility, a sense of actual not simply verbal solidarity towards the underclasses of South African society.
This scandalous neglect may already be having an impact on the standing of democracy in our society. What is the value of the vote if politicians can act with such indifference? “The opposite of good is not evil”, said Abraham Joshua Heschel, “but indifference”. Politicians need to be aware that where democracy comes under threat they cannot rely on the masses to defend it where they derive no benefit from its operations. Ruth First remarked in her book The Barrel of the Gun, at the time of regular coups d'etat in Africa that it was significant that the masses, while not applauding the onset of military rule, did not rise to defend civilian rule.
When many of our forebears adopted the Freedom Charter in 1955, when we celebrated the adoption of the new constitution in 1996, it was intended that those who had been on the margins, would be brought into the centre, the centre that it was hoped would be a place of opportunities, where dignity would be respected, the centre where all would enjoy equality, where all would live with adequate healthcare and without threats to their safety, where freedom for all would prevail.
Over 20 years since the first democratic elections and the adoption of the constitution, some very important gains have been achieved, but these have been marred by the continued marginalisation of large segments of South African society, who live without bare necessities required for survival. Poverty signifies hunger and it is very difficult when hungry, when scrounging for food and shelter, when facing continued unemployment and homelessness, to maintain one's dignity. We expected in the early 1990s that the new democratic government would give more than a helping hand, that it would be there to help those who stumbled or to find a way of picking up those who had never been able to rise and enjoy the necessities of life.
Notions like democracy, freedom, transformation and emancipation are processes that ought to be continually developing not seen as achieved at a single moment. That may well be true, that our understanding of freedom and these other concepts must continually broaden as new possibilities for enlarging the scope of human freedom are understood as achievable. But we are not there. Instead, we are seeing human will and lack of human will constitute obstacles in the way of achievement of basic human dignity and rights that ought to belong to all. It is vital that we, the people of South Africa, located wherever we are find ways to stand together with the most downtrodden, to help ensure that the democratic promise, cherished by so many is in fact realised in this country.

NEW YORK (AP)  Starbucks plans to start testing concoctions that mix coffee and ice cream.
The Seattle chain said it will serve "affogato" varieties of hot or cold coffee over ice cream at 100 stores in Orange County, California, starting Wednesday, with pricier versions sold at 10 locations with its "reserve" bars.
Spokeswoman Holly Hart Shafer said the treats were first introduced at the company's Roastery store in Seattle, which is a pipeline for potential new menu items. She noted that "affogato" means "drowned" in Italian. The priciest version at regular stores is a 12-ounce option that costs $6.45 and mixes cold brew coffee with ice cream.
The test was first reported by Business Insider.

Starbucks Corp. has successfully driven up sales over the years in part by introducing pricier new items.
DENVER—Lawyers are expected to make closing arguments Monday in a trial concerning allegations that a former radio host groped Taylor Swift backstage before a concert in Denver, and competing allegations the singer's mother and her radio liaison set out to destroy the DJ's career after the photo op took place.
A federal judge on Friday determined that former DJ David Mueller didn't prove that Swift personally tried to end his career, but identical allegations against Andrea Swift and Frank Bell are expected to go to jurors.
Mueller sued the three after Swift's team reported the 2013 encounter to his bosses. He's seeking up to $3 million, saying the allegation cost him his job.
Swift countersued for a symbolic $1. The jury will also consider her assault claim.
She called the encounter with Mueller despicable.

“Our expectation is that, by keeping prices low, we will be able to get rid of the black market. However that will happen over time,” Morneau said.
The ministers pegged the cost at about $10 a gram. Each gram of marijuana would have a tax of $1 on sales up to $10 and a 10-per-cent tax on sales worth more than $10.
The agreement on the 75-25 tax revenue split came Monday during a meeting between federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his provincial counterparts.
OTTAWA—Legalized pot will cost Canadians about $10 a gram and Ottawa has agreed to give the provinces 75 per cent of the tax revenues to help cover costs of setting up the new regime.
But even with the richer cost-sharing agreement, provincial ministers were quick to warn that no level of government will be getting rich from Ottawa's move to legalize cannabis, due to take effect July 1.
The federal government in October had proposed a 50-50 split, a formula that prompted much grumbling among the provinces.
Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa said the price could be even less than $10 a gram as governments try to squeeze out the illegal market. “It's important for us to be responsive to the marketplace,” he said.
In fact, they all warned that the costs of setting up the system to sell legalized recreational pot will far outweigh the tax revenues, estimated to be about $400 million a year in the early years. The federal government pegged its costs so far at $700 million and municipalities estimate their costs at between $210 million and $335 million a year.
“Our priority is not revenue. It's not profit. Our priority is to get off the ground and get out of the gate in a smooth transition to a new market where we've not been before,” said Cathy Rogers, New Brunswick's finance minister.
Sousa said Ottawa and the provinces are attempting to learn the lessons of other jurisdictions where cannabis has already been legalized and ensure that investments in policing and public health are made upfront.
“We are investing quite a bit of money in those issues,” Sousa said. “But going forward, we know there is demand for cannabis. Quite a bit.” He predicted that tax revenues will grow “quite substantively.”
Under the revenue-sharing agreement, which will be in force for two years, the federal share will be capped at $100 million, meaning any additional tax revenues will go to the provinces and territories.
Morneau said it would be up to the provinces in turn to decide how much to give municipalities, which last week demanded a one-third share.
Sousa told the Star after the meeting that he is aware of the needs of Ontario's towns and cities.
“I need the municipalities not to be out of pocket on this stuff, so I'm concerned to make sure that they also have recovery. I'm working with them to ensure that those costs ... are recovered,” Sousa said.
At their meeting, finance ministers also talked about the need to make changes to crack down on tax evasion measures, as exposed during recent Panama Papers and Paradise Papers exposés.
“We know there are some individuals who are moving money overseas to a country avoiding taxation or worse, to launder money or partake in terrorist financing,” Morneau said.
He said the finance ministers agreed that action was needed to better know the actual owners of companies.
“We need to be able to see into companies to know who actually owns those companies,” he said.
“We agreed to take concrete steps to ensure that we have knowledge of who owns companies across our country so that we can do a better job at ensuring that we don't have tax evasion. We don't have money laundering,” he said.

Islamabad
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Monday challenged the PPP's move to nominate Senator Sherry Rehman for the opposition leader's position in the Upper House of parliament.
In a letter to incumbent Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani, PTI Senator Azam Khan Swati held that the list of members supporting Senator Sherry Rehman for the slot of opposition leader in the house contravenes the rules and procedures of the house.
Last week, Senator Rehman had submitted her nomination papers, supported by 33 members of Senate, to Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani. She had said that with the exception of PTI, MQM-P and JI, members of all other opposition parties as well as the independents had endorsed her nomination as the new leader of the opposition in Senate.
In his letter on Monday, Senator Swati argued that the independents should first declare whether they wish to be a part of the treasury or opposition benches, following which they should be allowed to support a candidate for the leader of the opposition.
Last week, Senator Rehman had submitted her nomination papers, supported by 33 members of Senate, to Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani. She had said that except for the PTI, MQM-P and JI, the members of all other opposition parties as well as the independents had endorsed her nomination as the new leader of the opposition in Senate.
The PTI had previously demanded that the PPP withdraw Senator Rehman's name from the running. The party has accelerated its efforts to thwart the PPP move and met with representatives of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), senators from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) as well as the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) to seek their support. While talking to media, Senator Swati — himself a nominee for the seat — claimed that the party enjoys support of the majority of opposition members.
Sources, however, claim that the party has so far been unable to get the number of votes required to succeed.
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP)  The Republican-controlled North Carolina legislature can keep for now its authority to confirm Cabinet secretaries of the new Democratic governor, a state judicial panel has ruled.
Three trial court judges rejected the request of Gov. Roy Cooper to extend a temporary block on the confirmation law the judges had issued last week. The law is among many approved just before Cooper took office and viewed by Democrats as undermining his authority.
The law subjects Cooper's department heads to the "advice and consent" of a majority of senators. Cooper sued last month, saying confirmation doesn't apply to his picks.
The judges' order, released Tuesday, rejected Cooper's argument he would suffer irreparable harm if Cabinet members that he's chosen had to go before Senate committees. The governor could return and seek an injunction again if a secretary fails to receive confirmation, the judges wrote, but for now the harm is "speculative."

In the meantime, Cooper and Senate Republicans disagree about whether the order means confirmation hearings can begin.
Senators earlier laid out a plan to hold confirmation hearings on Cooper's eight current Cabinet picks through mid-March. The first hearing had been scheduled last week, but the judges' temporary block was released hours before that meeting. The judges heard more oral arguments last Friday on extending the delay.
Republican Senate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore praised the judges' denial of Cooper's request to "stop the people's elected representatives from conducting a fair, open and transparent hearing process to determine whether his proposed Cabinet secretaries are qualified, without conflicts of interest, and willing to follow the law."
Republican legislative leaders say the state Constitution gives the Senate authority to scrutinize the Cabinet, but attorneys for Cooper's attorney say confirmation doesn't apply to his Cabinet and cuts into core powers. Tuesday's order doesn't address the constitutional issues raised in the litigation. A trial on those issues is scheduled for early next month.
In the new order, dated late Monday, Superior Court Judges Jesse Caldwell, Todd Burke and Jeffrey Foster said the Senate "cannot begin the advice and consent process until the governor submits a nominee."
The judges wrote the governor has until May 15 to formally submit the nominees' names to the Senate, and he's yet to do so. So the hearings shouldn't begin until then, Cooper general counsel William McKinney said.
"We are satisfied with the ruling," Cooper spokesman Ford Porter said in an email citing the judges' words on the nominees. Porter added the governor plans to wait until the trial is held early next month before submitting nominees, "which he believes will not be necessary."
Berger told reporters the temporary block to confirmation hearings has now been lifted, and legislative leaders believe the May date doesn't apply to the Cabinet picks that have been sworn in and are clearly performing duties for Cooper.
"I think he's nominated them," Berger said.
The GOP-led General Assembly and the governor already have been fighting in court on other matters.
The same three-judge panel blocked another new law that shifted oversight of elections away from the governor and toward the legislature. After several days of legal filings, the state Supreme Court preserved that ruling late Monday.
In federal court, a judge agreed with Moore and Berger last month and blocked attempts by Cooper or President Barack Obama's administration to approve Medicaid expansion in the state.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Eagles star quarterback Carson Wentz has a torn left ACL and will miss rest of the season and playoffs, coach Doug Pederson confirmed.
Wentz, a favorite in the NFL MVP race, had an MRI on Monday that revealed the severity of the injury. Wentz was hurt late in the third quarter Sunday at Los Angeles. Backup Nick Foles rallied the Eagles (11-2) to a 43-35 win over the Rams that secured the NFC East title and put them in first place in the conference with three games remaining.
The Eagles have overcome several key injuries and now have to move forward without their most indispensable player. Nine-time Pro Bowl left tackle Jason Peters, return specialist/running back Darren Sproles, star linebacker Jordan Hicks and special teams captain Chris Maragos already went down for the season.
"If there's ever an opportunity for me to rally the troops as the football coach, now might be the time," Pederson said. "You can't lose faith. This has been a resilient football team all season long."
After starting all 16 games as a rookie, Wentz made a giant leap this year. He passed for 3,296 yards and set a franchise single-season record with 33 touchdown passes while only tossing seven interceptions.
Foles led the Eagles to a pair of field goals on consecutive drives against the Rams. He is 20-17 as a starter in six seasons with the Eagles, Rams and Chiefs.
Pederson insisted the offense won't change with Foles.
"He's a highly intelligent football player," Pederson said.
A third-round pick by former Eagles coach Andy Reid in 2012, Foles in his second stint in Philadelphia. He replaced an injured Michael Vick in 2013 and led the Eagles to an NFC East title during Chip Kelly's first season as coach. Foles tied an NFL record with seven TD passes in a game at Oakland in November 2013 and finished that season with 27 TDs and only two picks. The Eagles lost at home to New Orleans in the playoffs. Foles went to the Pro Bowl and was the offensive MVP.
But Kelly traded Foles to St. Louis for Sam Bradford after the 2014 season. Foles spent a year with the Rams, a season with the Chiefs and returned to Philadelphia as a free agent this season.
Second-year pro Nate Sudfeld is Philadelphia's No. 3 quarterback. Pederson said he hasn't spoken to personnel boss Howie Roseman about adding a third quarterback yet.
"I'm absolutely ready to go — need be," Foles said after the win over the Rams. "I prepare every day."
U.S. energy companies this week added oil rigs for a third week in a row, the longest string of increases since summer, as higher crude prices prompt drillers to return to the well pad after a break in the autumn, reports Reuters.
Drillers added two oil rigs in the week to Dec. 8, bringing the total count up to 751, the highest level since September, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.
The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still much higher than a year ago when only 498 rigs were active after energy companies boosted spending plans for 2017 as crude started recovering from a two-year price crash around the same time OPEC agreed to the production cuts a year ago.
Last week, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia agreed to extend oil output cuts of about 1.8 million barrels per day until the end of 2018 as they try to finish clearing a global glut of crude.
The increase in U.S. drilling lasted 14 months before stalling in August, September and October as some producers trimmed their 2017 spending plans after prices turned softer over the summer. Energy firms started adding rigs again in November as crude prices rose.
So far in 2017, U.S. crude futures have averaged over $50 a barrel, easily topping last year's $43.47 average. This week, futures traded near $57 a barrel, just below their highest since June 2015.
Looking ahead, futures were trading near $57 for calendar 2018 and $54 for calendar 2019.
In anticipation of higher prices than in 2016, exploration and production (E&P) companies increased their spending on U.S. drilling and completions in 2017 by about 53 percent over 2016, according to U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co.
In addition, Cowen said 17 of the 64 E&Ps they track, including Chevron Corp, have already provided capital expenditure guidance for 2018 indicating a 17 percent increase in planned spending over 2017.
Chevron this week said it planned to boost U.S. upstream capital expenditures to $6.6 billion in 2018 from $5.7 billion in 2017.
Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week boosted their forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig count to an average of 876 in 2017, 1,001 in 2018 and 1,128 in 2019. Two weeks ago, it forecast 874 in 2017, 927 in 2018 and 1,074 in 2019.
There were 931 oil and natural gas rigs active on Dec. 8. The average number of rigs in service so far in 2017 was 873. That compares with 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.
Back in November, Kandi admitted to locking lips with Porsha, in turn sparking all sorts of heated exchanges. Now that a new year has arrived, Porsha has chosen not to let the matter of Kandi's sexual orientation stay in 2016.
While Real Housewives of Atlanta star Porsha Williams has her own situation to deal with, following recent accusations she was behind a leaked sex tape involving her ex-husband, Kordell Stewart , that hasn't stopped her from airing out some more of Kandi Burruss 's personal business also.
During last night's episode (airing Jan. 1), it appears as though Porsha has exposed another key player in the ongoing drama by alleging Kandi has a regular side chick — who happens to be Porsha's best friend.
During a conversation with Phaedra Parks, Porsha's best friend Shamea Morton's name was brought up, with Phaedra claiming that Shamea and Kandi had also been sleeping together. Porsha didn't deny any of it, and needless to say, Shamea is not pleased, going as far as to say that Porsha broke "girl code" by not sticking up for her.
Following the episode, Shamea took to Instagram to share some thoughts, with her post reading, "When someone you consider a best friend will cosign a lie about you ...it gives you a new definition of friendship! #hurt #girlcode."
Many fans are wondering why Porsha didn't defend her best friend, and now as a result, the situation just got even more messy.

Municipalities are concerned with fatberg – caused by dumping fats, oils and grease that clog your pipes.
As many sit down this weekend for the Thanksgiving feast, they may not realize they are contributing to a costly problem.
The average 14 pound turkey produced about 250 millilitres or 1 cup of fat.
Image that multiplied by thousands of homes in this community alone and it can create a problem down the line.
Many municipalities are encouraging people to not pour fats, oils and grease (or FOG) down the drains. They mix with other items such as wipes and dental floss to create what's called a fatberg.
As soon as the FOGs go a short distance, they start to harden and end up clogging the sewage system.
Metro Vancouver spends about $2 million to repair the damage caused by these products and homeowners can also face costly bills when their pipes get blocked. That's why it created the Wipe It, Green Bin It campaigns to educate residents, but these tips can be used in homes throughout British Columbia.
Disposal:
• For small amounts of grease, wipe or scrape out the pot or pan and put the grease into your green bin.
• Larger amounts of grease, like deep fryer oil, can be dropped off at an approved recycling depot.
Kitchen cloggers:
• Fats – dairy produts, salad dressings, margarine, butter, shortening.
• Oils – cooking oils such as olive, canola, vegetable, corn, peanut, coconut) as well as oil-based sauces.
• Grease – pan drippings, trimmings from meat, lard.
READ ABOUT THANKSGIVING COOKING FIRE SAFETY
Smart home technology – and we're specifically thinking here about white goods – has a problem that no one seems to be talking about.
For many years we've been hearing keynote speeches at CES about how all of our kitchen devices are going to be able to talk to each other, and it seems like 2018 is the year that a few companies will actually manage to crack it.
During its CES keynote, LG showed off a smart fridge that can display recipes on a screen on its door, and, when you start cooking, can automatically turn the oven on and preheat it to the right temperature.
Hey Bixby, call the installer
Samsung likewise was touting its range of smart kitchen tech that can all be controlled from one slick interface in the Family Hub fridge. This is thanks to Samsung's industry-leading work with its SmartThings hub. It also announced that SmartThings is coming to the Gear S3, so you'll be able to control your home from your watch.
Given that it's Samsung, the announcement mentioned Bixby, its own take on the voice assistant. This means we're genuinely entering the age where you'll be able to pop to the shops, and, while you're there, ask Bixby if you've got milk in the fridge. Heady times indeed.
Samsung's Family Hub fridge
The problem is that technology becomes redundant at a far faster rate than the devices it's being put into. If you need to replace your phone every couple of years it's inconvenient, but it's not the end of the world.
If your oven becomes worthless after four years, that's a serious problem. Not only is it a significantly bigger financial investment, it requires specialist installation that's a much bigger upheaval than replacing a device you can fit in your pocket. Often a kitchen is designed with your key white goods in mind, so replacing them would mean your kitchen no longer works from a design point of view.
We now live in a day and age where white goods shouldn't be considered luxury items, so a malfunction taking an oven or fridge out of action means you're suddenly faced with a major bill to replace something that's essential to your everyday life, so can't be put off to a more convenient time.
A modern, modular solution
One solution is to make these smart goods modular. If it was only the door of your oven that had technology in it, with the rest of it being a standard oven, then you'd only need to replace the door, not the entire unit, which would keep both the cost and the inconvenience to a minimum.
Likewise, in the case of your smart fridge, creating a simple pop-out panel that houses the screen and speaker would mean manufacturers would simply have to comply with certain dimensions and coupling requirements when creating updates, and the user won't get saddled with the cost of keeping up with a constantly evolving market.
Redundancy is a big issue at the moment, with Apple in hot water as its handling of the iPhone 6's obsolescence comes back to bite it in a big way, so manufacturers need to be giving serious thought to how this issue is going to be tackled.
A McLaren, running on an Amstrad (no, not really)
A couple of years ago it came to light that the McLaren F1 team had found themselves in a situation where their £10 million cars were having to be maintained using a Compaq LTE 5280 laptop from 1996, due to a compatibility issue that meant the computer couldn't be updated.
That's a major organization, with vast amounts of money to invest in keeping modern and a redundant technology running simultaneously, but the reality for most of us is that once our smart speaker or phone overtakes our over by more than a couple of generations they're simply going to stop being able to communicate with each other. And we won't have McLaren's deep pockets or engineering dream team to fudge together a fix in time for dinner.
Manufacturers are surely aware of this problem, so it would be nice to see what efforts are being made (if any) to stop this incompatibility from becoming a major issue in a few years' time.
At the moment it's only high-end, luxury items that feature this smart technology, which means it may be a problem that only those that can afford such items will experience. But this technology will in time trickle down to more affordable devices, so the issue needs to be addressed, and soon. The answer may not be modular, but a solution needs to be found.
LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - West Ham United have sacked director of player recruitment Tony Henry following allegations of racial discrimination, the Premier League club said on Friday.
According to a report in the Daily Mail newspaper, Henry said the club wanted to limit the number of African players in their squad as “they have a bad attitude” and “cause mayhem” when they are not in the team.
A statement from the club said: ”West Ham United have today terminated the contract of Director of Player Recruitment, Tony Henry, with immediate effect following his unacceptable comments that were widely reported in the press. Our action follows a full and thorough investigation.
“West Ham United will not tolerate any type of discrimination.”
The decision follows the Football Association announcing on Thursday that it was investigating the matter. (Reporting by Christian Radnedge; Editing by Pritha Sarkar)
Beyond Boggy Creek – Reviewing the Southern Bigfoot
Beyond Boggy Creek: In Search of the Southern Sasquatch is the new book from Lyle Blackburn. If you are into Cryptozoology, you will know of Lyle's two previous books, The Beast of Boggy Creek and Lizard Man. If you enjoyed those two titles, then you will definitely want to get your hands on his new one. As the title of the book suggests, Lyle's latest release focuses on Bigfoot in Texas, Arkansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi and more. There is no doubt that when people think of Bigfoot, they often picture large and lumbering hair-covered man-beasts roaming around the forested wilds of the Pacific northwest. But, that's not always the case. As Beyond Boggy Creek reveals, there is a huge body of data, sightings, and encounters suggesting that whatever the southern Bigfoot is, it's thriving just fine.
I read the book over three nights (sadly, they weren't dark and stormy, which would have been ideal weather!). And, I can tell you, for sure, that it makes for very intriguing reading. One of the reasons why the book is a definitive page-turner is because Lyle is a skilled and atmospheric writer: he sets the scene, draws the reader into the stories, and provides captivating case after case. There is another reason why this book is an important one for Cryptozoology: Lyle is someone who spends a great deal of time in the woods, swamps and wild places in the South. In other words, most of the material presented in the book comes from Lyle's own, personal investigations and interviews – which is always a good thing. With that all said, now let's take a look at the content of Beyond Boggy Creek. If you thought there was nothing new to say about Bigfoot, it's time to think again.
What stands out about a lot of the cases Lyle has on record is the sheer, shocking, life-changing nature of so many of the Southern encounters. Indeed, it's clear from many of the reports Lyle has investigated that the witnesses find themselves significantly changed by their encounters with a legendary beast that many suggest should be relegated to the world of campfire tales.
The book is comprised of eleven chapters. One of the most notable chapters – in my opinion – is titled “Marauding Manimals.” This portion of the book tackles a deeply controversial aspect of Bigfoot history and lore. Namely, that the Sasquatch creatures are not the shy, placid creatures that many believe them to be. Rather, Bigfoot might be your worst nightmare – and particularly in the South. Lyle heads into disturbing territory as he chases down creatures that the witnesses describe as dangerous, violent and – maybe – even deadly. Yes, we're talking about killer-Bigfoot beasts. For an aspect of the Bigfoot phenomenon that many might find overly sensational, Lyle keeps a calm head on his shoulders as he details a surprisingly large number of reports on the South's far-less-than-friendly man-beast.
In “Native Giants” Lyle addresses the matter of what the Native American people of the South know of Sasquatch. This is a chapter which takes us into the world of the Bigfoot of centuries long gone – as well as to the present day. As Lyle notes (and as one example of many): “The Creek tribe, found throughout parts of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina, used a term that undeniably evokes imagery of Bigfoot. Honka, which means ‘hairy man.'” Lyle states that it “was said to be elusive and favored privacy, which the tribe duly respected.”
The controversial saga of the Lake Worth Monster of Texas is a case that Lyle gets his teeth into, too. A story that erupted in 1969, it involved a strange beast seen in the woods of the aforementioned Lake Worth. While it has become locally known as “the Goat-Man,” Lyle makes a good case that it may actually have been a Bigfoot. I was also very pleased to see that Lyle extensively covered the matter of the Skunk Ape of Florida – a beast which may or may not be the same as that which haunts the Pacific Northwest. Notably, Lyle discusses what may have been his very own late-night encounter with a Skunk Ape in early January 2016. With research partner Cindy Lee, he came across…well…something…in Florida's Ocala National Forest. Lyle skilfully describes the incident which had hearts pounding and adrenalin kicking in big-time. Perhaps, one day, Lyle will do a full-length book on the Skunk Ape – we can hope so!
Other sections of the book which are guaranteed to catch your attention, include “Body Snatchers,” “Lurkers in the Lowlands,” “Bad Reputation” and “Howls in the Night.” Add to that a comprehensive list of Southern names for Bigfoot (such as the Wood Booger, the Shiny Gorilla, the Happy Valley Horror, and the Twin Lakes Red Eyes), detailed maps showing the range of Bigfoot in the South, and numerous photos from Lyle's own collection, and what you have here is an excellent regional study of one of the most mystifying of all the creatures that fall under the banner of Cryptozoology. Hopefully book number 4 won't be too faraway!

ERIN, WIS.—Dustin Johnson wrapped up his final day practice round for the U.S. Open just as the sky began to rumble and the horn sounded to stop play at Erin Hills.The timing couldn't have been better for the world's No. 1 player, as it has been the past two weeks.As much as he hates missing cuts, the Memorial two weeks ago was a good time for Johnson to have a weekend off. It allowed him to spend two days in Wisconsin getting to know the longest course in U.S. Open history, realizing that he would be a late arrival to Erin Hills because of some important family matters.River Jones Johnson, his second son, was born on Monday.He finds out Thursday whether his game is in shape for Johnson to become the first back-to-back U.S. Open champion in 28 years, but his mood couldn't be better. About the only thing to fear, outside of the thick fescue that frames the fairways at Erin Hills, is the house where he is staying.Article Continued BelowIt has a double-spiral staircase.“I sit down when I go down the stairs now,” Johnson said with a smile. “I slide down on my butt.”Stairs were the only thing that could stop him earlier this year. A winner of three straight tournaments — against the strongest fields of the year — Johnson slipped in his socks going downstairs to move his car in the rain on the eve of the Masters and bruised his back so badly that he had to withdraw the next day.

Some suspended school bus routes in West Maui could be back in service as soon as Monday.
Always Investigating pressed the state Department of Education's top officials about the bus crisis.
Both the new superintendent, Christina Kishimoto, and her assistant in charge of the bus operations, Dann Carlson, tell us the end of the bus service crunch is near.
Since school started a week ago, there have been no pickups for many routes that serve Lahainaluna and Baldwin high schools, and Iao Intermediate. The DOE says it will announce some restorations there as soon as Monday.
Eleven drivers still need to be hired on Maui.
We found out consolidating 10 Oahu routes, primarily in Central and West Oahu, are freeing up staff to be assigned to the Valley Isle.
Nanakuli Elementary, Nanaikapono Elementary, Waianae High, Kapolei Middle, Kapolei High, Waipahu Intermediate, Waipahu High, Webling Elementary, Aiea High
Meanwhile late pickups continue, but for nine of 12 contract areas across all islands, it's been less than the contractually mandated two percent maximum of routes, with most vendors having no late pickups by the third day of school (defined as 10 minutes after the bell).
There have also been “a few reports” of wrong drop-offs.
DOE officials say they have no plans to pursue breach of contract against any vendor short on drivers at this time.
Always Investigating asked, if the routes can be so easily redefined when the originating cause is a shortage of workers by any of the vendors, how can a vendor ever be held to task for that if the route can simply be redesigned?
“We'll work with the situation and try and work through whatever we can make happen,” Carlson replied. “We have standards that we're asking them to get to. We want to see a thriving competitive transportation market and I think we're at a point where we are getting that.”
“I wanted to be very clear about my expectations. I don't want any students missing instructional time, so we have to resolve this. My tolerance is it has to be done soon,” Kishimoto said.
Kishimoto says she'll hold weekly Thursday meetings with Maui vendor Ground Transport until all routes are back to normal.
Carlson says long-term, they've recommended staggered bell schedules in some areas where the driver shortage is the most severe.

The Gateway Pundit
In late 2004 I started The Gateway Pundit blog after the presidential election. At that time I had my twin brother Joe and my buddy Chris as regular readers. A lot has changed since then. Today The Gateway Pundit is one of the top political websites. The Gateway Pundit has 12 million visits each month (Stat Counter – Google Analytics). It is consistently ranked as one of the top political blogs in the nation. TGP has been cited by Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, The Drudge Report, The Blaze, Mark Levin, FOX Nation and by several international news organizations.
The Nikkei Asian Review newspaper is reporting that the Japanese entertainment company Konami is blacklisting former employees in the Japanese video game industry . "The company is particularly targeting those who work for Kojima Productions, which was founded in 2016 by Hideo Kojima, who used to be a top designer at Konami," reports Ars Technica. From the report:
"Alexa, wake me up to Rick Astley."
Smart speakers can be used for a laundry list of different things, but as I've quickly been discovering with my Google Home Mini, some of them are fantastic little alarm clocks. Amazon's Echo devices have long supported alarms, but a new update now allows users to wake up to the song of their choice rather than Amazon's default alarm tune.
To choose the song that you'd like to wake up to, simply say "Alexa, wake me up to" and then the song of your choice. You can choose a specific title that you'd like to hear first thing in the morning, or you can wake up to a certain genre or playlist if you'd like. Also, if you really don't care what song you hear, you can always just say "Alexa, wake me up to music" to be woken up by a random selection.
Echo speakers will be able to use music for alarms from Amazon Prime Music, Amazon Music Unlimited, iHeartRadio, Pandora, SiriusXM, Spotify, and TuneIn.
Amazon says this is a feature that's been highly requested by many of its users, and it's coming out just in time for the Echo Spot that's scheduled to go on sale December 19. As for existing Echo hardware, they'll be able to use this feature starting today.
Perivolaris, a long-time TTC special constable, was heading to Yonge and Finch Ave. on Monday to respond to a “red alarm,” a silent alarm used for high-level emergencies triggered on a bus at the intersection, when he realized that the situation was far more serious than he had imagined.
These are but a few of them.
They were ordinary people who provided food and water to the first-responders, who came together amid the carnage on Yonge St. on Monday afternoon with acts of selflessness, generosity and kindness.

“When I pulled around to the southwest corner of Yonge and Finch, I noticed that the fire truck in front of me stopped, and I saw all the carnage on the sidewalk, many bodies injured, bloodied up,” he told the Star.
Perivolaris and his young partner, who he was training that day, arrived at about 1:30 p.m., and immediately set to work checking on bodies and administering first aid.
“The first thing we're trained to do is make sure there's an airway, heartbeat, breathing,” he said. “I just started moving down to one lady, went over and felt her, I knew she was not going to make it, and I moved on to the next one.”
Perivolaris, who had been on shift since 5 a.m. Monday, ended up staying at the scene until about 7:30 p.m., moving down Yonge, helping people as best he could. When other TTC constables showed up, he helped in directing them.
“I've been on here for 23 years, and what happened was, in my mind, my training kicked in, and my years of experience kicked in, and I was much too busy to think about what was going on other than to assist as much as possible and allow your training to do what you're supposed to do,” he said.
“But when it was all over, after a 15-hour shift, and I went home, that's when I started realizing the hurt, the type of effect it's going to have on thousands of people in our great city.
“We had a lot of help there from a lot of citizens, just wonderful people. They were trying to assist in first aid, others just trying to comfort people, trying to feel for pulses, trying to assist in gathering evidence.”
There were about 12 special constables and a sergeant on the scene at one point, supporting police, fire and EMS, said Mike Killingsworth, head of transit enforcement at the TTC.
“I sent a message out to the team yesterday saying how fiercely proud I am of them,” he said. “I don't think the public in the city realizes the contributions that all of my members, but especially my special constables, make on a daily basis.”
Franklin Edishou
A franchisee of the Pizza Nova on the corner of Yonge and Finch, Edishou was in the back of his store working alongside his wife when he saw the commotion immediately after the van struck.
The scene outside the store was traumatic: at least five people lay injured on the ground, while others were rushing to their aid.
Recognizing a major incident was unfolding, Edishou's wife — who had burst into tears — quickly left to pick up their children from school. Alone in the store, Edishou realized he could make a small contribution.
As police, fire and ambulance personnel descended, he began throwing pizzas in the oven, putting them in boxes then taking them out to first responders who he knew “couldn't have breaks, they wouldn't have anything like lunch.” He also brought them water.
Having something to do helped Edishou as he attempted to process the horror of what had happened right outside his store. An Iranian immigrant, he said the scene reminded him of something that might happen in his own country, not here.
“I've been through a lot — that's why it's devastating to see this stuff in this country, it's a beautiful country, peaceful country. This happens? I have no words,” said Edishou.
As he was making the pizza, he was reflecting on how the eldest of his five kids, his 17-year-old daughter, often takes the subway to Yonge and Finch, crossing the same intersection where the injured lay. It could have been anyone who was killed, he said.
Edishou is reluctant to take any credit for his actions, saying “it was nothing — a small token of appreciation.”
Diego DeMatos
DeMatos, a former flight attendant, and a friend had just finished lunch and were driving north on Yonge toward the GoodLife fitness centre at Finch. He was driving slowly, searching for parking when he saw the white rental van driving at what he estimates was up to 80 kilometres an hour.
“There were two people standing at the corner waiting for the light to change to green to cross ... It was a Black female and a white male. It all happened so fast. The lady got turned back into the building and the guy got thrown into the middle of the street and the van kept going,” he said.
DeMatos thought he had witnessed a hit-and-run incident. The man was bleeding from the head and the people attending to the woman were calling out for someone to give them a belt to try to stop the bleeding.
His mind was racing, his body shaking. A few metres up the road, there were four or five more people on the ground. Bystanders were screaming, panicking. Some of the victims were moving. Others were not. The sounds of sirens started filling the air.
That is when DeMatos heard someone calling for help. He saw a man attending to another victim who had been struck and was lying in the middle of the street.
DeMatos' flight training and experience had taught him to remain calm in panicked situations. He had once delivered a baby in mid-air. Another time he attended to a passenger suffering a heart attack during a flight.
“The instinct kicks in and everything rushes back into your head,” he said. “I asked the guy what was wrong before I jumped in. The guy was in panic, so I took over.”
The victim was in his 50s or 60s with light coloured hair, DeMatos said. He was bleeding from the head and had suffered leg injuries. DeMatos began to perform CPR on the victim, but before long he realized the man was already dead.
“I could see there was nothing we could do. It was too late,” DeMatos said.
A lady nearby came to offer her light-coloured scarf to cover the dead man's face. Then the police, fire and ambulance crews arrived and cleared people away from the scene.
Since that time, when DeMatos has not been recounting what he saw for journalists, he has been looking for pictures online in order to find out about the man he fought in vain to keep alive.
“I just want to keep following the news and see if I can find the guy ... I don't know if it was the last minutes that he had,” he said, momentarily overcome with emotion. “It's important to me.”
Eric Chak
He was heading back to his office near Yonge and Finch from a late lunch around 1:30 p.m. when he saw a person lying on the ground, face-down.
“I first thought it was a car accident,” said the 35-year-old information security analyst with Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.
Then he saw many more people, some standing and others lying on sidewalks, stretching down Yonge. There were no police yet on the scene. Seeing blood all over the place, he quickly decided to jump into action, using his limited first aid skills.
“The injuries were very graphic,” he said. “Someone was already doing chest compression on one girl, and when I checked, there was no pulse.”
The image of that girl covered in blood with no vital signs haunted him as he kept trying to figure out what just happened, while trying to assist those who needed attention. There were at least five people on the sidewalk who needed CPR or help to “not choke on their own blood,” he said.
When first responders arrived, Chak stepped aside and watched in horror as the girl was wrapped in an orange bag.
After the emergency responders had taken over, Chak headed back to work. He admits he “was scared but thought I was fine.”
“It didn't hit me until late, when I kept drifting back to the scene and wondering whether I could have done more,” he said on the phone from his home outside Newmarket. The HR office sent him home on an indefinite leave so he can recover.
“That scene yesterday was beyond what anyone can ever imagine,” he said.
Katherine Liu
Outside of the Secret Garden Floral & Gift Boutique near Yonge and Finch on Tuesday, bunches of blooming flowers were set on the sidewalk. A sign amid the blooms read “With heartfelt sympathy! Please feel free to take!”
Liu, a co-owner, said the free flowers are a way to help “the world feel better.”
Liu said there are a lot of pedestrians on Yonge, and that many have been stopping to pluck a stem or two from the overfilling vases and buckets on the sidewalk.
“They walk by and they just take a little flower,” Liu said.
The store kept the overflowing selection of flowers stocked throughout the day.
One woman in a pink sweater paused outside the store, taking in the scene. She apprehensively plucked a few stems before walking into the store. Moments later, flowers in hand, she left wiping tears from her eyes.
A man ducked into the floral shop to make sure they could, in fact, take the flowers for free. Another woman thanked Liu profusely, and asked for an elastic to tie the stems together.
Jesse James
As police investigators started combing through the wreckage and people around the world turned to the news for details, James called on his network of Christian faith leaders in the Willowdale area. At 8 p.m. that night, more than a dozen people were gathered into the Puck n' Wings bar at the northeast corner of Yonge and Finch, working on a plan to serve the spiritual needs of their horrified community.
They quickly decided to organize a 1:30 p.m. prayer vigil Tuesday at Olive Square Park, just south of the intersection as well as a 6 p.m. prayer walk near Mel Lastman Square. But they also decided on a longer-lasting contribution in an attempt to pay tribute to the 10 people killed and others who were injured by the speeding van.
“We're going to be playing music at Olive Square Park for the next 25 days — a day for every person who has been hurt, killed or injured,” said James, who is a member of the Spring Garden Church. “The goal is to turn our cries of sorrow into songs of healing. We love Willowdale, we love the people here and all of us were affected by it, although some more closely than others.”
The music will be played each day at 1:30 p.m., to mark the time that the carnage began.
“The only instruction they have is to play songs of hope or songs of lament,” James said, adding that while Christian faith leaders have initiated the project, they would like to see musicians or singers of other faiths.
“We're inviting anyone to participate. In fact, the more who participate the better. It will help to galvanize this community for a health process of healing and grief.”
Yep. We've been doing this for 24 long weeks. The Chicago Blackhawks record currently stands at 30-34-9, for 69 points. This is good for 24th place in the league. If you had the ability to go back one year and then look ahead to today, you probably wouldn't believe it. After all, the Hawks have made the playoffs the past nine years in a row, and finished the regular season on top of the Central Division with 109 points and 50 wins last year. Not to mention those three Cups. We all thought the Hawks might not be as good this year, but no one saw them being this bad.
Yet this is the state of affairs as we sit today. It's getting harder and harder to watch the Hawks as this season winds down. Because even when this not-so-good team plays well, they rarely manage a win anymore. It's rock bottom right now. All we can do is try to look for the silver lining, and build for the future. With that in mind, let's discuss this past week's matchups.
Blackhawks matchups this past week:
@ Winnipeg Jets, Thursday, 3/15. Loss 6-2
@ Buffalo Sabres, Saturday, 3/17. Loss 5-3
Vs. St. Louis Blues, Sunday, 3/18. Loss 5-4 in OT
What Went Right for the Blackhawks-Forward Depth
This past Thursday, it was Brandon Saad and Patrick Sharp with goals. On Saturday, defenseman Jordan Oesterle, Tomas Jurco, and Jonathan Toews all scored. Sunday's contest included four goals from the Hawks: three from Alex DeBrincat, and one from David Kampf.
That's seven different players scoring goals, and pretty much every line represented. If you delve deeper and look at assists, 11 players contributed helpers throughout the last three games. The first line of Saad, Toews, and Kane led the way, as they're supposed to do. An argument can be made that loading up on the first line is at the expense of the other three lines. But the kids and company have proven them wrong, finding ways to contribute. And they're doing it on their own, without the support of the big boys. This is a good sign for the future.
What Went Wrong for the Blackhawks-Can't Close it Out
Um, they lost? Yeah, that's the simple answer to what went wrong. But here's the thing. The Hawks scored first in two of the last three games. They were winning in the third period in two of the last three games.
This team has forgotten how to win. Even when they're winning and playing well, they can't close it out. They find a way to lose. Whether it be a defensive breakdown, a soft goal, or a missed offensive opportunity, they always let the opponent back in the game. If they're going to go anywhere next year, the Hawks need to rekindle that will to win.
Blackhawks Goal of the Week
Well, well, well. I'm sure it comes as no surprise that we highlight DeBrincat's hat trick from Sunday night. The irony here is Brinksy was demoted from the second line to the third line for the last two contests. Perhaps it had something to do with him not scoring for 13 straight games. But he brought that to an end with a power play goal and then two more scores for good measure. Here's his third tally of the night.
﻿
This marks DeBrincat's third hat trick in his rookie season. He's now tied with Kane for the team lead of 25 goals on the season. Kudos to DeBrincat for making things happen with fellow linemate Jurco. But think what he could, and will, do with a more skilled partner. Next year, my friends.

Other Blackhawks News and Notes
Five Hawks' players have 20 or more goals this season. As mentioned earlier, Kane and DeBrincat lead with 25 goals. Toews, Nick Schmaltz, and Artem Anisimov each have 20 goals. Kane and Toews have now scored 20+ goals in 11 consecutive NHL seasons.
Defensive breakdowns are by far one of the biggest problems for the Hawks. This could easily be part of the “what went wrong” section. Last week it was Duncan Keith being a turnover machine, and this week the new third pairing of Oesterle and Connor Murphy especially struggled.
On a positive note, Jan Rutta played on the first pairing with Keith for the last two games. He stepped up with a solid defensive effort, and has taken his increased ice time in stride.
J-F Berube came in to relieve Anton Forsberg after Forsberg's exceptionally bad start on Thursday. He also took the net both Saturday and Sunday in back-to-back tilts. He's put up a valiant effort, especially considering the defense in front of him. But it still isn't good enough. He has a tendency to give up a lot of rebounds, as well as soft goals at the most inopportune times.
Matthew Highmore left Sunday's game in the second period after crashing hard into the boards. He did not return.
What's on Tap for the Blackhawks
Are you still with me, boys and girls? Are you going to see it to the end, and watch the rest of the season? Yeah, it's depressing, but there are silver linings.
Debrincat is the silver lining #Blackhawks — Sean Fitzgerald (@Diesal3426) March 19, 2018
The Hawks meet the Colorado Avalanche on Tuesday and the Vancouver Canucks on Thursday at the United Center. They head to New York to play the Islanders on Saturday. We're getting down to the wire. There's only three short weeks left to watch Chicago Blackhawks' hockey. If you can still stomach it. Hey, maybe they'll win a game or two.
Shall I state the obvious? Today is January 1 and not only does that mean many have mentally hit the reset button, but snow season is here in a big way. In the New York Tri-State region we've received a couple small storms but once we enter January it tends to be an all-new ball game.
That said, Agent 001 and I were wondering: What are YOUR favorite crossovers, sport-utility vehicles and trucks?
In addition, WHICH do you think are BEST in the snow?
As you may expect we know that our audience, the tastemakers, really have a handle on the best products on the street. While I could start sharing my thoughts right now, I'd rather wait until the comments open up.
So, what say you, Spies?

Shaun Derry said that he won't shy away from the challenge of turning around Cambridge United's fortunes after their 2-0 defeat to Yeovil Town.
It was a desperately disappointing result for the U's with a lack of clinical finishing coming back to bite them again.
After dominating for best part of an hour, and having three wonderful opportunities to take the lead, they conceded from a set-piece, finished off by Nathan Smith, before Alex Fisher scored with his first touch to make it 2-0.
And the U's head coach, who is without a win on the road since September, said he was “sick and tired” of his side not making the most of their chances.
“Goals change games and we had three fantastic opportunities to score,” he said.
“Two in the first half, one in the second half and we didn't take them and goals change games, it's as simple as that.
“It doesn't really matter what you do in between both 18-yard boxes. It's all about scoring goals and defending for your life.
“We didn't score goals today and we didn't defend for our lives when we needed to and we ended up losing 2-0.
“And that's what it's going to say in the papers tomorrow morning and I'm sick and tired of it.
“I'm sick and tired of it, I'm sick and tired and it's like a broken record – going in there and saying you have to take your chances, you've got to be more ruthless in both boxes.
“And at this moment in time we're not. I cannot wait for certain people to come back into our starting XI, I cannot wait because I need more from the boys at this moment in time.”
After a run of three games away from home, the U's are back at The Abbey on Friday against Lincoln.
And the U's head coach said that he was “determined” to take them into that game.
“I'll tell you what, one thing is for sure. I won't be shying away from the challenge, absolutely not and the boys won't shy away from the challenge,” he said.
“I am determined to take them into the next battle and that's what my intentions are.”
DOHA, Qatar -- Defending champion Novak Djokovic had a slow start to his first match of 2017 before prevailing 7-6 (1), 6-3 over Jan-Lennard Struff in the first round of the Qatar Open on Monday.
Second-seeded Djokovic trailed 4-0 in the opener before recovering to 5-5 and finally finding his form in the tiebreaker, where his 63rd-ranked German opponent won only one point.
The second-ranked Serb broke serve in the first and last games of the second set to close out the match.
Djokovic next plays Horacio Zeballos, who beat Florian Mayer 6-7 (3), 6-4, 7-6 (9).
Top-seeded Andy Murray plays 69th-ranked Jeremy Chardy of France in his opener on Tuesday.
Murray, who took the top ranking from Djokovic at the end of last year, was in action on Monday with Mariusz Fyrstenberg in the doubles. The pair lost to David Marrero and Nenad Zimonjic 6-2, 6-4.

Albuquerque, N.M. — Typewriter enthusiasts gather at an Albuquerque restaurant to experiment with vintage Smith Coronas. Fans in Boston kneel in a city square and type stories about their lives during a pro-immigration demonstration. A documentary on typewriters featuring Tom Hanks and musician John Mayer is set for release this summer.
In the age of smartphones, social media and hacking fears, vintage typewriters that once gathered dust in attics and basements are attracting a new generation of fans across the U.S.
From public “type-ins” at bars to street poets selling personalized, typewritten poems on the spot, typewriters have emerged as popular items with aficionados hunting for them in thrift stores, online auction sites and antique shops. Some buys antique Underwoods to add to a growing collection. Others search for a midcentury Royal Quiet De Luxe — like a model author Ernest Hemingway used — to work on that simmering novel.
The rescued machines often need servicing, and fans are forced to seek out the few remaining typewriter repair shops.
“I haven't seen business like this in years,” said John Lewis, a typewriter repairman who has operated out of his Albuquerque shop for four decades. “There's definitely a new interest, and it's keeping me very busy.”
Renewed interest began around 10 years ago when small pockets of typewriter enthusiasts came together online, said Richard Polt, a Xavier University philosophy professor and author of “The Typewriter Revolution: A Typist's Companion for the 21st Century.” Since then, the base of fans has dramatically grown, and various public events have been organized around the typewriter.
“It's beyond the phase where this is just a fad,” Polt said.
It's almost impossible to gauge recent typewriter sales. Almost all of the original manufacturers are out of business or have been bought out and become different companies. The Moonachie, New Jersey-based Swintec appears to be one of the world's last typewriter makers, selling translucent electronic machines largely to jails and prisons.
But operators of thrift stores and estate sales say typewriters are some of the quickest items to go.
“That's part of the fun: the hunt,” said Joe Van Cleave, an Albuquerque resident who owns more than a dozen typewriters and runs a popular YouTube channel on restoring the machines. “Sometimes, like a little luck, you might find something from the 1920s in great condition.”
Doug Nichol, director of the upcoming documentary “California Typewriter,” said the interest stems from “digital burnout” and people wanting a connection to the past. That interest seems to transcend age, he said.
“Kids who grew up knowing only mobile phones and the computer are excited to see a letter typed with your own hand,” said Nichol, who owns 85 typewriters. “It's a one-on-one interaction that doesn't get interrupted by Twitter alerts.”
In his film, set for release in August, Nichol interviews Hanks, who said he uses a typewriter almost every day to send memos and letters.
“I hate getting email thank-yous from folks,” Hanks says in the film. “Now, if they take 70 seconds to type me out something on a piece of paper and send to me, well, I'll keep that forever. I'll just delete that email.”
Hank owns about 270 typewriters but often gives them away to people who show an interest.
One way the typewriter craze is growing is through organized “type-ins” — meet-ups in public places where typewriter fans try different vintage machines. Such events have been held in Phoenix, Philadelphia, Seattle, Los Angeles and Cincinnati.
During a recent type-in at Albuquerque soul food restaurant Nexus Brewery, around three dozen fans took turns clicking the keys of an Italian-made 1964 Olivetti Lettera 32 and a 1947 Royal KMM, among others.
Rich Boucher spent most of his time on a 1960s-era Hermes 3000 crafting poetry.
“I haven't used a typewriter in forever,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Cambridge Analytica, the UK political consultancy at the centre of Facebook's (FB.O) election manipulation scandal, ran the campaigns of President Uhuru Kenyatta in the 2013 and 2017 Kenyan elections, according to video secretly recorded and broadcast by Britain's Channel 4 News on Monday.
FILE PHOTO: CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, speaks during the Web Summit, Europe's biggest tech conference, in Lisbon, Portugal, November 9, 2017. REUTERS/Pedro Nunes/File Photo
The company denied all allegations made by Channel 4 News regarding its business practices.
The news channel said it mounted a “sting operation” in which it said had secretly recorded top Cambridge Analytica executives saying they could use bribes, former spies and Ukrainian sex workers to entrap politicians around the world.
The New York Times and the British Observer newspaper reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had acquired private data harvested from more than 50 million Facebook users to support Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mark Turnbull, a managing director for Cambridge Analytica and sister company SCL Elections, told Channel 4's undercover investigative reporting team that his firm secretly stage-managed Kenyatta's hotly contested campaigns to run the East African nation.
“We have rebranded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging. I think we wrote all the speeches and we staged the whole thing - so just about every element of this candidate,” Turnbull said of his firm's work for Kenyatta's political party, known as the National Alliance until 2016, and subsequently as the Jubilee Party.
Kenyatta came to power in 2013 and won a second and final term last August, defeating opposition leader Raila Odinga by 1.4 million votes. The Supreme Court nullified the vote citing procedural irregularities and ordered a second election.
Last September, former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called the second election a “project” of Cambridge Analytica. The Jubilee Party has not commented.

Odinga did not contest the repeat vote on Oct. 26, saying it would be unfair because the election commission had failed to implement reforms and Kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote.
At a prior meeting, Turnbull told the reporters: “Our job is to really drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else to understand what are these really deep-seated fears, concerns. “It is no good fighting an election campaign on the facts, because actually it is all about emotion.”
Cambridge Analytica officials were recorded saying they have used a web of shell companies to disguise their activities in elections in Mexico, Malaysia and Brazil, among various countries where they have worked to sway election outcomes.
Chief Executive Alexander Nix is recorded boasting: “We are not only the largest and most significant political consultancy in the world but we have the most established track record. We need to operate through different vehicles, in the shadows.”
“I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you,” he tells the reporters.
Cambridge Analytica denied all allegations made by Channel 4 News regarding its business practices. The company said in statement it was humouring the undercover reporters and trying to gauge their motives by actively encouraging them, “to tease out any unethical or illegal intentions”.
Channel 4 noted that their last meeting with Cambridge Analytica had taken place in January at a London hotel and that company employees had continued to email them seeking to strike a deal to work on a Sri Lankan campaign up until recently.
Cambridge Analytica acknowledged in a statement that, its CEO had “misjudged the situation”. Nix said: “I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called ‘honeytraps', and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose.”

Rising seniors from across the state of Alabama gathered at Huntingdon College for a three day Economic and Community Development Scholars Program.
"We've tried to inspire them to consider a career in Economic Development," said Anthony Leigh, the Senior Vice President of Huntingdon College. "It's so important for the future of our state that we are growing the next generation of leaders," Leigh continued. "We think that here at Huntingdon College we are well positioned to be able to train and equip students to go forth to apply wisdom in their communities."
Leigh says he is eager to see how the students affect the people around them after leaving the three day event.
"We think that we're a great place for them to come and get some training, and we're excited to see where life takes them and see the unique ways in which they go forward to advance their local communities," said Leigh.
Chambers of commerce across Alabama were invited to nominate one rising high school senior to participate in the Economic and Community Development Scholars Program.
"They've been here since Monday, and they've had a number of speakers," said Leigh. "They visited with the governor in her office on Monday. We toured a local chamber of commerce. They got to experience the Montgomery Biscuits, and for the last two days they've been involved in an economic development simulation where they've had an opportunity to represent a local community and to package it and sell it to try to attract a company to bring its facility to them," Leigh said.
The program concluded on Wednesday with a mock ground-breaking and ribbon-cutting ceremony. At the "graduation" ceremony, the students received hard hats along with an incentive.
"We want these students to be Huntingdon students. So we've given them an economic incentive to be Huntingdon students with a tuition discount if they choose to come to Huntingdon," said Leigh.
The tuition discount is worth $12,500 annually, and $50,000 in total.

DESPITE political odds and hurdles government succeeded on Tuesday in getting approval of Federal Budget for the financial year 2017-18, which also amounts to reiteration of National Assembly trust in the government. Government easily completed all legal formalities and passage of the Finance Bill gave legal cover to the budgetary proposals.
Final version of the budget is not much different from what Finance Minister Ishaq Dar had presented before the National Assembly on May 26 except some inconsequential amendments incorporated at the behest of the Senate or to please some vested interests. No doubt, the budget was widely believed to be balanced, development and welfare oriented but there was still room to improve upon the proposals to ensure maximum benefit for the people, resolution of problems of some segments of the society and also to help realise the objective of greater mobilisation of resources to meet ever-growing expenditure. In a democratic dispensation, the Opposition fulfills this responsibility during debate on budgetary proposals. The budget also evoked reaction from different stakeholders affording an opportunity to government to bring about changes if it so desires but the elected members especially those belonging to Opposition are better placed to analyse the proposals thoroughly, put forth workable recommendations and pressurise government through the force of argument to make changes. However, the Opposition missed the opportunity on flimsy ground that government was not willing to telecast their speeches live on Pakistan Television. This is despite the fact that government of Syed Khurshid Shah did not oblige the then Opposition but he was adamant to get concession from the present government. The Opposition also staged the drama of holding sessions outside Parliament House but not to speak of live coverage by private channels, it received no worthwhile coverage at all because there was no substance in their speeches. It is because of failure of the Opposition to carry out in-depth study of budget that government ignored the popular demand for more increase in salaries of government servants, which are now less than those in Sindh, and announced a negligible increase in minimum wages. Regrettably, government also did not pay heed to the justified demand of people to reduce import duty on milk as authorities obliged domestic mafia that makes people drink Urea-mixed milk as has been substantiated by Islamabad administration during recent raids.

Four years on from the launch of the Loneliness: The Hidden Epidemic campaign, The Yorkshire Post speaks exclusively to the newly appointed Minister for Loneliness, Tracey Crouch
LIKE nine out of ten women, after the birth of her first child two years ago, MP Tracey Crouch felt the twingeing ache of loneliness for the first time.
It is an experience many people - from all walks of life - can relate to, and one she will use in her new role as the country's first ever Minister for Loneliness.
Speaking to The Yorkshire Post exclusively as it marks the fourth anniversary of the Loneliness: The Hidden Epidemic campaign, the MP tells how work has already begun implementing a host of actions aimed at tackling loneliness, after the Government accepted in full the recommendations of the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness last month, and speaks of her own experience of loneliness, which affects 9m people across the UK.
“I think we all have moments of feeling isolated or alone,” Ms Crouch said. “I'm a relatively new mum and despite the fact that I have a wonderful partner and a close network of family and friends there are always times as a new mum when you do feel quite isolated.
“I have been very open in the past about suffering from depression and anxiety and the Jo Cox Commission highlighted that people who suffer from a mental health condition can sometimes feel quite isolated as part of their condition.
“There is no one-size-fits-all solution and I think it's really important to stress that because loneliness is quite subjective and therefore you have to have flexibility in some of the solutions. Not everything is going to suit every person.
“So, the way I dealt with feeling isolated when my other half was at work and I was at home with the baby was to go out and do some exercise, obviously taking the baby with me. That's not something that everybody would want to do. I didn't want to go to the mother and baby groups, whereas others would be more comfortable with that.
“Because there's not one single problem, there's not one single solution.”
Part of her “phenomenal” challenge over the coming weeks and months will be to bring in a metric to measure loneliness and to develop a cross-Government strategy that will be used to tackle loneliness in people of all ages.
But why her? With growing evidence of loneliness as a health issue, there was an element of surprise when Theresa May announced her first Minister for Loneliness would come not from the newly-named Department for Health and Social Care, but from Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.
“There was a recognition that part of my portfolio on Civil Society already crosses many Whitehall departments and has real facilities for what the Commission's recommendations were looking at, i.e. that cross-departmental approach to tackling loneliness,” she said.
“But I hope as well that it's a reflection of what I have done before I was a minister. I did quite a lot of work on the loneliness campaign, albeit for older people. I was heavily involved in some of the Parliamentary activity through Contact the Elderly, Silver Line and things like that - so I'm not necessarily new to the issue. As a minister I have that greater opportunity to look at it across all departments and actually, through a completely different demographic as well because in the past, I think there was a very heavy, and understandable, focus on older people.
“But what the Jo Cox Commission found was significant evidence of loneliness within all parts of society.”
Since 2014, when this newspaper began raising awareness of loneliness, the issue has become increasingly under the spotlight - but it is only now that the Government has pledged to make a concerted effort to tackle it.
Ms Crouch said: “People are beginning to talk about it a lot more. We're beginning to recognise the health impact of loneliness and therefore why it's important to remove the stigma around talking about loneliness or saying that you're lonely or isolated in order to ensure that we have better physical and mental wellbeing. With that, they will continue to contribute to their community and society, but also reap personal benefits from us being able to tackle that loneliness.
“The campaign that The Yorkshire Post has run in terms of raising it up the agenda is enormously important.
“All partners, and that's not just Government, central and local, but businesses and community groups as well, must recognise that they have a role to play in combating this and they will actually benefit from there being less isolation and loneliness in their areas.
“Making sure that we have coordinated understanding and approach to tackling isolation is one of the great challenges and that's what I will be doing over the coming months and hopefully years in looking how we tackle this. We are not going to be able to solve this problem overnight, or indeed within the next 12 months, but we can start by setting out a framework of how we can have a proper coordinated approach.”
She is also looking at how a Government fund can support initiatives working on loneliness.
Ms Crouch said: “There has to be some funding behind this. We've talked about different types of funds - we haven't put a figure on that fund, in part because the Jo Cox Commission want to help us co-design the fund, so we can't put a figure on it until we know exactly what it will do. Secondly, there will be different types of funding so we're looking at an innovation funds and looking at seed funding. But there will also be other funding opportunities in other departments.”
And so the work begins - but it will have to be juggled with her other responsibilities. This weekend she is in America for the Superbowl, and later this month, South Korea for the Winter Olympics.
She has already begun talking to the Social Care Minister so they can work together in developing the Government's loneliness strategy - one she's keen is not ignored.
“I'm really keen that it's not just a strategy for the sake of it,” she said. I'm not in this business to basically have a document that then gets put on a shelf and forgotten. I really want to make sure that what we do will really be the foundation for future work - because this is a generational challenge and I want to make sure that everything we do beyond that is building on those foundations.”
Tracey Crouch's top tips for tackling loneliness:
- “Bring an old hobby back, things you used to enjoy but for various reasons no longer do, like learning to paint or gardening.”
- “Going along to a sports club or physical activity like a Zumba class is great for making new friends and stay fit”.
- “And making new connections. Volunteering or making new connections can improve your mental health but it's also a fantastic way to meet people.”
Who is Tracey Crouch?
Tracey Crouch was elected as Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford in 2010, and became Minister for Sport and Civil Society in May 2015.
She grew up in Kent but was educated at the University of Hull, where she studied law and politics.
She is a keen sports fan, an FA-qualified football coach, and supporter of Leeds Rhinos.
In February 2016 she gave birth to son Freddie.
On January 16 this year she was given the remit of Minister for Loneliness, after Theresa May announced it was accepting the recommendations of the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness in full. Her task will be to lead a cross-Government group to drive action on loneliness across and keep it firmly on the agenda.
Peterborough & DAA have been waiting patiently for months to see bream weights dramatically improve at Ferry Meadows.
Now, after several matches that could only be described as disasters, it seems we can all breathe a sigh of relief.
Graham Page.
Round one of the new Ringer Bait series run in conjunction with the local club saw some fine weights taken at the venue even though conditions were yet again not ideal for bream fishing.
Leading the way was city rod Graham Page. He drew peg 66 on the Monument Bank and took full advantage of the draw putting a match-winning 82lb 10oz to the scales.
Page has been fishing the lakes for many years now and refused to join the band of anglers who deserted the venue complaining about the lack of fish and very poor results.
He knew it would come good and proved it fishing the feeder and catching steadily all day on a worm, maggot and caster combination.
Runner-up was Maurice Williams, who drew peg 48 and like the rest of the field caught on the feeder, putting 63lb 10oz to the scales.
Full Result: 1 Graham Page 82-10-0; 2 Maurice Williams 63-10-0; 3 M. Renshaw 62-0-0; 4 S. Farmer 60-4-0; 5 S. Cin 57-8-0; 6 J. Turner 53-6-0.
JOHN GARNER CHARITY
The Bank Holiday weekend was a really busy one at all the local commercial fisheries with just about all of them producing some fine results.
Pick of the matches has to be the John Garner Charity match on the Cedar Pool on the Decoy Lakes complex which saw some massive weights taken with the field averaging 123lb a man.
Top rod with 212lb 12oz was Kevin Lee. He drew peg 12 and started the match fishing the long pole taking a few fish in the first hour. But when that line slowed down, he switched to the shallow margins and caught big fish steadily all day on meat and corn.
Runner-up was Dick Warrener, who fished similar tactics to the winner to finish on 180lb 11oz. He was followed by John Smith with 178lb 15oz and Kevin Bevis on 158lb 1oz.
DECOY OPENS
Both of the Decoy Open matches also fished well.
In the Saturday match on the Yew Pool, Richard Bond took the honours with 178lb from peg 18. He fished casters shallow before having a good late run of fish close in on maggot.
Danny Calton came second fishing a pellet and paste approach from peg 15 putting 149lb 10oz to the scales and was followed by Chris Neal on 137lb 5oz.
Sunday's match saw a good turnout on the Beastie Lake and after a couple of weekends producing less than expected results it lived up to its reputation as one of the best venues on the complex.
Topping the field with 252lb 12oz was James Collison. He fished the feeder to the island and caught well early in the match from peg 24 before coming into the margins on maggot.
Tom Edwards took the runner-up spot from peg 22 catching in the margins on meat for 226lb 12oz, then came Simon Smith on 166lb 6oz.
OVER 55s
The Decoy Over 55s match was fished on the Yew Pool and saw the usual hot pegs producing the leading weights.
Out in front with 155lb 5oz on peg 20 was Keith Rayment.He started on the pellet and paste approach before switching to cat meat.
Runner-up was Jay Richardson, who caught close in from peg 19 for 115lb 7oz, then came Ron Cuthbert on peg 17 catching on the pole and pellet for 113lb 3oz.
MARTIN HOWARD MEMORIAL
As always the now annual Martin Howard Memorial match fished at the Decoy Lakes saw his old friends get together.
The one noticeable absentee was his brother Kieron who sadly passed away last year, both departing too young.
On to the match itself and after three match wins on the trot for Paddy Morley there is a new name on the trophy.
Paul Parsons took the honours with a magnificent 227lb from end peg 26 on Cedar Pool.
Runner-up was Andy Gausden with 188lb from peg three, then came Dave Corcaran with 172lb.
JVAC
JVAC fished the Willows at Decoy on Sunday which saw matchwinner Andy Knell top a strong field with 150lb all caught from peg 35 on the feeder.
Guy Dew took the runner-up spot fishing the feeder and pole from peg eight weighing 112lb, then came Chris Saunders with 119lb.
Amazon's AWS cloud computing service hosted its annual NY Summit today and it used the event to launch a new service: Amazon Macie. The idea behind Macie is to use machine learning to help businesses protect their sensitive data in the cloud. For now, you can use Macie to protect personally identifiable information and intellectual property in the Amazon S3 storage service, with support for other AWS data stores coming later this year (likely at the re:Invent conference in November).
The company says the fully managed service uses machine learning to monitor how data is accessed and to look for any anomalies. The service then alerts users of any activity that looks suspicious so they can find the root cause of any data leaks (whether those are malicious or not). To do all of this, the service continuously monitors new data that comes into S3. It then uses machine learning to understand regular access patterns and the data in the storage bucket.
The service also automatically detects certain data types like full names, addresses, credit card numbers, IP addresses, driver license IDs (U.S. only), social security numbers and birth dates, but it also can automatically detect different content types (email, SEC forms, data logs, database backups, source code, etc.).
All of this data then flows into a central dashboard that highlights high-risk files and other information about how users and other applications are accessing data.
As with all AWS services, pricing is complicated, but mostly based on the number of events and data the service processes every month. Because a lot of costs are bound to the initial classification of the data, the first month of usage is also likely the most expensive.
For now, Macie is only available in AWS's U.S. East (Northern Virginia) and U.S. West (Oregon) regions, though this footprint will likely expand over time.
It's worth noting that Amazon also announced that Glue, the company's service for preparing and loading data into its various database and storage services, is now available to all customers. In addition, the company used today's event to launch a new migration hub for enterprises that want to migrate some of their workloads to the cloud, as well as updates to the Elastic File System (now with encryption at rest), AWS Config and AWS CloudHSM for better key management.
It's a hockey fanatic's favorite time of year.
NHL hockey is back for the 2017-18 season, and with it arrives a whole new list of unknowns.
Can the Pittsburgh Penguins become the first team to win three Stanley Cups in a row since the New York Islanders won four in a row from 1980-83? Who will be the Columbus Blue Jackets of this season? How will the Vegas Golden Knights perform?
Although these queries won't officially be answered for six to eight months, here's a look at how the 2017-18 season could shake down.
New Arrival with The Biggest Impact
In an off-season that included several notable transactions involving impact players like Patrick Marleau (Maple Leafs), Kevin Shattenkirk (Rangers), and Artemi Panarin (Blue Jackets), the Montreal Canadiens will prove to be the real winner when the 2017-18 season concludes.
Jonathan Drouin, acquired in a trade with the Tampa Bay Lightning, brings a highly-explosive offensive game to a team in dire need of such a player. Since the 2009-10 season, the Canadiens have cracked the top ten in goals scored only once.
Drouin, 22, tallied 95 points (29 goals, 66 assists) in 164 regular season games with the Lightning, while also adding 14 points in 23 playoff games.
Max Pacioretty has led the Canadiens in scoring each of the last six seasons, but failed to eclipse the 70-point mark in any of those seasons, largely due to the absence of a dynamic counterpart. Not only will Drouin fill that void, but he sets up both himself and Pacioretty for career years.
With the talent and offensive firepower possessed by both Pacioretty and Drouin, the sky is the limit for the duo and the Canadiens offense.
Vegas Expectations
Just like any expansion team in any league, the Vegas Golden Knights will be in tough.
Goaltending is the only area not in question. Marc-Andre Fleury will shoulder a heavy workload this season and will give his team the opportunity to win its fair share of games. But it won't be enough.
Despite the solid goaltending Fleury will provide, the Golden Knights don't yet have the firepower or depth to consistently compete with organizations that have been building their rosters for years.
The top line of Jonathan Marchessault, Vadim Shipachyov, and Reilly Smith should have no problem finding the back of the net, but the remaining three lines will struggle mightily.
There will be ups and downs for the new club and their fans during the inaugural season, but the downs will far outweigh the ups.
The 2017-18 season will end with the Golden Knights being bottom three in the standings, but with a good chance of winning the draft lottery and potentially finding a future face of the franchise.
Most Surprising Team
Every season, there seems to be one team that surprises everyone – a team no one expects to be in playoff contention, let alone make the playoffs. Last season, it was the Columbus Blue Jackets. Two seasons ago it was the Florida Panthers.
This season, the Buffalo Sabres are primed for a breakout.
Fresh off of signing Jack Eichel to an eight-year, $80 million contract extension, the Sabres have all the pieces to be a playoff team.
The off-season acquisitions of forwards Jason Pominville, Benoit Pouliot, and Seth Griffith add to an already dangerous group led by Eichel, Ryan O'Reilly, Kyle Okposo, and Sam Reinhart. If everyone in the Sabres' top nine can stay healthy, this team will have no problem finding twine.
The Sabres also added two key defensemen in Nathan Beaulieu and Marco Scandella, which makes for a more reliable defensive core with Rasmus Ristolainen and Jake McCabe already on the back end.
With the pieces they have on offense and defense, the Sabres will find themselves in the postseason for the first time since 2010-11.
Dark Horse Goaltender
Everyone expects top goaltenders like Carey Price, Braden Holtby, and Sergei Bobrovsky to perform well. It's why they get paid more than the average goalie, and it's why they get criticized more than the average goalie.
But there's also the dark horse; the underdog.
Everyone loves an underdog story, and this year it will be Frederik Andersen.
Although the Toronto Maple Leafs had a strong overall season in 2016-17, Andersen struggled at times posting a 2.67 goals-against average (GAA) and a .918 save percentage. The 2.67 GAA was the highest of his career.
On a team as raw as the Maple Leafs were last season, there were bound to be some growing pains defensively. But, with Mike Babcock likely making defense a top priority this season and the younger players gaining more experience, the stars could align for Andersen to have an outstanding year.
Andersen has all the skills to be a top goaltender in the NHL, and, with a little help from his teammates, will be that guy this season.
Who Wins the Calder Trophy?
In a season lacking a Connor McDavid or Auston Matthews-type rookie, the race for the Calder Trophy is truly anyone's game.
It won't necessarily come down to who leads the rookie scoring race, but who is given the biggest opportunity.
Boston Bruins rookie defenseman Charlie McAvoy finds himself in the perfect situation to have an outstanding rookie campaign.
McAvoy will begin the season locked into a top four defensive roles, while also quarterbacking the top power play unit until Torey Krug returns.
Not only does he have a huge opportunity, he also has significant experience after playing last season's playoff series against the Ottawa Senators, tallying three assists in the process.
Although McAvoy won't be challenging Nico Hischier or Clayton Keller for the rookie scoring title, the significant role he plays on the blue line coupled with the 40-plus points he amasses will win him the Calder Trophy.
Surprise Team to Miss Playoffs
Just like the surprise team to make the playoffs, there's always the team that doesn't live up to expectations.
Whether it's bad luck with injuries or too many significant off-season departures to offset, it happens every year.
Unfortunately for hockey fans in Tennessee, the Nashville Predators may leave you disappointed come April.
After making it to the Stanley Cup Finals last season, the expectations surrounding the Predators are sky-high.
But, overshadowed in the deep playoff run is the reality that the Predators squeaked into the playoffs with 94 points for the final wild-card spot, which may have been a different story with a significant injury or two.
Well, the injury bug has already arrived in Nashville as defensemen Ryan Ellis is set to miss at least the first half of the season due to knee surgery. The Predators also said goodbye to forwards James Neal and Mike Fisher in the offseason.
The Predators aren't the same team without Ellis, Neal, and Fisher, and, although the off-season acquisitions of Scott Hartnell, Nick Bonino, and Alexi Emelin may soften the blow a little, it won't be enough.
Who Wins the Stanley Cup?
In eight of the last nine seasons, the Stanley Cup has been won by one of three teams: the Pittsburgh Penguins, Chicago Blackhawks, or Los Angeles Kings.
Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins would like to keep that trend going, while also defending the title for the third year in a row.
But as much as Sid the Kid and company would like to make it a three-peat, there's a new kid on the block named Connor McDavid looking for his first taste of Stanley Cup glory. And he doesn't want to wait.
The Edmonton Oilers proved in last season's playoffs they're for real.
The Oilers outplayed the San Jose Sharks in every facet of their opening 4-2 series win, a Sharks team that's been to playoffs 11 of the last 12 seasons. They gave the Anaheim Ducks all they could handle in a series that went the full seven games; a series they probably should've won.
The off-season acquisitions of Jussi Jokinen and Ryan Strome add even more depth and experience to an already elite roster.
This season, the Oilers will deploy a well-balanced lineup led by the most dynamic player in the NHL, and use the experience from last season's playoff run to win their first Stanley Cup since 1990.
The time is now for the McDavid and the Oilers.
Feb 2 (Reuters) - China Jialing Industrial Co Ltd Group :
* SAYS IT SOLD 6,255 MOTORCYCLES IN JAN Source text in Chinese: bit.ly/2DWbldr Further company coverage: (Reporting by Hong Kong newsroom)
BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will hike rates in August on concerns that already above-target inflation will climb further, according to economists in a Reuters poll, in contrast to a survey just a month ago which saw an increase only in the second half of 2019.

That dramatic shift in expectations was driven by India's annual consumer price inflation accelerating in April to 4.58 percent, above the central bank's target of 4 percent for the sixth month in a row, after easing in each of the three previous months.
The May 24-30 poll of nearly 60 economists showed the RBI will hike its repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent in August.
While the median suggests the RBI will keep rates on hold when it meets on June 6, about 40 percent of the economists polled expected a hike next week.
“As global market turmoil takes its toll, we are changing our RBI policy rate call from an extended pause to a 25 basis point hike at the August meeting,” said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Société Générale.
“The RBI may announce a change in policy stance during the June meeting and follow that up with a hike in August.”
Kundu said that while RBI's inflation expectation has been “erring on the side of hawkishness, with actual inflation mostly relatively underwhelming, the latest inflation data, though not too high, raise the prospect of a rate hike.”
The inflation rate increased due to higher domestic food costs and crude oil prices, which hit $80.50 a barrel on May 17, their highest since November 2014.
With India importing 80 percent of its fuel needs and government spending increasing before national elections next year - which will likely add to price pressures - expectations have firmed for the RBI to move away from a neutral stance next week.
Out of 42 economists who answered an extra question, 24 said they expect the central bank to change its monetary policy stance to a tightening bias in June. More than 35 percent anticipated that in August.
Just last month, a majority said the RBI would turn hawkish by December.
Currently, the RBI estimates consumer inflation of 4.7-5.1 percent in April-September before dipping to 4.4 percent for the remainder of this fiscal year.
A total of 19 out of 31 economists who answered another question said the RBI would revise inflation projections up. Eleven said it would be unchanged and one said it would be revised down.
“The RBI cut its inflation forecasts based on the weakness of observed inflation the first couple of months of the year, so it was not premature to cut the forecasts,” said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics.
“It did note some upside risks to the inflation outlook, some of which have come to fruition. So it is likely that forecasts will now be revised up.”
The first three months of 2018 likely saw the fastest economic expansion since July-September 2016. Data for the latest quarter will be announced later on Thursday.
More than 80 percent of the 30 economists who answered an extra question said the RBI would keep its growth projections for 2018/19 unchanged. Two predicted an upgrade and three said it would be revised lower.
Steve Belichick doesn't want to put a label on his career goals. He was noncommittal to titles, though he was open to pretty much all of them.
Belichick said he'd be happy to call plays or serve as an offensive or defensive coordinator.
“I would do anything in the NFL. Whatever the team asks me to do, I'll do it the best I can,” he said.
But what if someone asked him to be a head coach?
“Who would be asking me that? I wouldn't probably have a team if they asked me to be a head coach. I only work for one head coach, and that's him [Bill Belichick],” Steve said. “When he goes, maybe I'll just have to reevaluate my philosophies.”
While there's certainly no guarantee, Steve Belichick is on a natural trajectory to become the Patriots defensive coordinator. He has spent time as the team's safeties coach for two years. With Matt Patricia leaving, the Patriots could promote linebackers coach Brian Flores to defensive coordinator. If that happened, Belichick might bump into a new role. There's no guarantee of any of that, but it's a common progression within the organization. Patricia and Flores have both worked the safeties and linebacker positional jobs.
Belichick spoke broadly about his career goals.
“I think about that a lot. For me, it's really about, as a coach, my goal is to make my players better,” Belichick told Patriots Wire Thursday. “And my personal goal is to make my players better. That's really all I care about. I love football. I love everything that it's given me and my family in life. I owe a lot to this sport. I don't necessarily have aspirations to put as job title next to my name. I've never been about that. That's never been important to me. I want to be around people that I enjoy working with. It's a tough business. It's hard to win. And it's not important for me to have a job title just to have a job title. It's important to me to win football games with good people. That's all it is. If in five year, I'm winning football games and around good people, I'll be happy.”
Steve has progressed, in part, because he's so tapped in with his players. Bill praised Steve for having such a good sense of what his players need and articulating that to Bill.
“Ever since my dad's been a head coach with the Patriots, I've taken as much of my time that I could to put myself in their shoes and learn the game,” Steve said. “I knew early that the best way for me to learn was to put myself in the shoes of the player, not as the coach. The volume is a lot less for the player — kind of what they're given. It's important to put myself in their shoes and try to absorb the information as they would. That's what I try to do now. I take all the information in as a player and as a coach, just try and understand how it's presented to them and make sure that they understand it.”

“Some days, I imagine strangling my daughter to death,” said Janila Jean, who was 16 years old when a UN peacekeeper from Brazil raped her at gunpoint.
This is an alarming statement with empathetic understanding. The situation in Haiti with peacekeepers is extremely disturbing, yet disgustingly common. I can't believe that globally we still turn a blind eye to such horrendous acts on vulnerable people.
The selfish, inhuman behaviour of a “peacekeeper” has unbelievable, lifelong consequences that affect only innocent people.

Georgia Assembly House Speaker David Ralston recently named Rhonda Briggins, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority's senior director of External Affairs, to the House Commission on Transit Governance and Funding.
House Resolution 848, passed during the 2017 Session of the Georgia General Assembly, established a commission to study the conditions, needs, issues and problems regarding Georgia transit. The council will provide transportation recommendations aimed at benefiting Georgia's local and regional economy. Transit studies, generated from the commission's activities, will also review potential funding mechanisms.
‘This is an amazing opportunity for not only MARTA but for transit state wide as Georgia takes a hard look at funding and governance,” said MARTA Sr. Director of External Affairs Rhonda Briggins. “We are especially grateful to Speaker Ralston for his leadership and vision to move Georgia in the right direction.”
The council will consist of six members of the House of Representatives, four representatives of transit systems or counties, four residents of the state of Georgia and ex-officio appointees. MARTA GM/CEO Keith T. Parker will serve as an ex-officio member with leaders from the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) and the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA).
Rehana Khursheed Hashmi, 75 (2nd L) migrated from India with her family in 1960 and whose relatives, live in India, prepare pan (beetle leaf) while sitting with her grandsons and daughter in-law at her residence in Karachi, Pakistan August 7, 2017. Picture taken August 7, 2017/
KARACHI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As India and Pakistan prepare to celebrate 70 years of independence from Britain next week, thousands of families in the nuclear-armed neighbours remain divided by a border that strained diplomatic ties make harder to cross.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947, and relations remain tense, particularly when it comes to the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both claim in full.
"The people who have migrated are not able to come to India, nor can we go there freely," said Asif Fehmi, a resident of a New Delhi neighbourhood where thousands of Muslim families divided by Partition have blood ties over the border.
"We can't meet them freely, and there was a time when we couldn't talk to them freely."
Fehmi's family was among the millions of people whose lives were disrupted in 1947, after departing British colonial administrators ordered the creation of two countries - one mostly Muslim and one majority Hindu.
A mass migration followed, marred by violence and bloodshed, as about 15 million Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, fearing discrimination, swapped countries in a political upheaval that cost more than a million lives.
During the chaotic transition, train cars full of bodies arrived at railway stations in the twin cities of Lahore and Amritsar in the province of Punjab, split roughly down the middle at partition on August 14, 1947.
Many survivors of the bloodshed found themselves separated from family on the other side of a hastily drawn-up border.

"I was unable to understand what Partition was, because I was not old enough," said Rehana Hashmi, 75, whose family migrated from India to Pakistan's southern city of Karachi in 1960. "My brother told me that India and Pakistan had emerged."
The move to Pakistan, when Hashmi's father retired from a career in India's railways, left behind many close relatives, but they kept in touch.
When Hashmi's husband, Khurshid, died in 1990, bringing to a close a 26-year-long marriage, his first cousin, Asif Fehmi, sought a Pakistani visa to attend the funeral.

"I knew some people in the Pakistan embassy," said Fehmi. "I finally got the visa, but when I reached there, it was already over. So, at a time when we should have been there, we weren't."
Both sides of the family long to be closer, with ties unimpeded by travel curbs or poisoned by nationalist bluster.
But the mutual suspicion between the two countries creates unwarranted barriers for families wrenched apart by history, Fehmi added.
Hostilities have intensified since a series of bombings and shootings in India's financial capital of Mumbai in 2008, and an attack on its parliament in 2001, both of which India blamed on militant groups based in Pakistan.
Pakistan has repeatedly accused India of aggressive lobbying in Washington and among the nations of Southeast Asia, aimed at isolating it internationally.
For the Hashmis and the Fehmis, as for thousands of other families, the quarreling has meant fewer visits across the border.
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will address the United Nations Security Council on Feb. 20 during the body's monthly meeting on the Middle East amid tensions over the United States decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Since President Donald Trump broke from decades of United States policy with his Dec. 6 announcement on Jerusalem, Abbas has said he will ask the council to grant full U.N. membership to the Palestinians and will only accept an internationally-backed panel to broker any peace talks with Israel.
“This will be a good thing for members of the Security Council to listen to the president himself,” said Kuwait's U.N. Ambassador Mansour Ayyad Al-Otaibi, president of the council for February. “No council members rejected this proposal.”
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the Security Council last week that Abbas lacked “the courage and the will to seek peace.”
Trump has threatened to withhold aid to the Palestinians if they did not pursue peace with Israel but Abbas has said the United States had taken itself “off the table” as a peace mediator in recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon accused Abbas of “seeking to put an end to any possibility of negotiations with Israel” with his address to the 15-member Security Council.
“Abbas is completely misreading today's reality and harming the prospects for a better future for his people,” Danon said in a statement on Thursday.
Al-Otaibi said Israel had not yet asked to send a high-level representative to the council meeting.
In 2012, the U.N. General Assembly granted de facto recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state when it upgraded their status to a “non-member state” from an “entity.”
However, the U.N. Security Council has to recommend a state for full membership to the General Assembly, which then needs to approve it with a two-thirds majority. The United States would likely veto a Palestinian bid in the Security Council.
In December the 193-member General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that voted in favour. A total of 128 countries backed the resolution, which is non-binding, nine voted against and 35 abstained. Twenty-one countries did not cast a vote.

A study conducted by PhD candidates at the Stony Brook University resulted in identifying malvertising as a major culprit for exposing users to technical support scams which allowed them to build an automated system capable of discovering, on a weekly basis, hundreds of phone numbers and domains operated by scammers. They wrote: "By allowing our system to run for more than 8 months we collect a large corpus of technical support scams and use it to provide insights on their prevalence, the abused infrastructure, the illicit profits, and the current evasion attempts of scammers. .. [I]n a period of 250 days, we discover 8,698 unique domain names involved in technical support scams, claiming that users are infected and urging them to call one of the 1,581 collected phone numbers. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the first one that can automatically discover hundreds of domains and numbers belonging to technical support scammers every week, without relying on manual labor or crowdsourcing, which appear to be the main methods of collecting instances of technical support scams used by the industry. ... From a financial perspective, we take advantage of publicly exposed webserver analytics and estimate that, just for a small fraction of the monitored domains, scammers are likely to have made more than 9 million dollars."

B-Reel Films's Mattias Nohrborg, a leading Scandinavian producer who's attending Goteborg's Nordic Film Market, is developing a biopic film of Manchester United star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, based on his critically-acclaimed memoir “I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic.”
The film is being written by David Lagercrantz, who had co-wrote “I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic” with the Swedish Swedish soccer superstar in 2011. Lagercrantz also penned the latest book in the “Millenium” franchise, “The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye.”
Nohrborg told Variety that the untitled biopic will chart Zlatan's childhood in a harsh, underprivileged suburb of Sweden called Malmö with his immigrant parents from the Balkans. The feature will show how Lagercrantz left Sweden and came to play for Ajax of Amsterdam and Juventus of Turin, quickly rising to fame.
“Zlatan has had an unbelieving destiny; he was brought up in a ghetto where more than 90% of the youth end up being delinquents, and he made everything himself, he's completely self-learned,” said Nohrborg, who added that the feature will also depict the footballer's brashness. Nohrborg pointed out he knew Ibrahimovic personally.

The film, whose estimated budget is 5 million euros, will shoot on location in the Swedish suburb Malmö as well as in Amsterdam and Turin. Nohrborg said the script will be ready by May 1st. The producer will likely be looking for Deutsch and Danish partners. Ibrahimovic is expected to either co-produce or executive produce the film.
A global star, Ibrahimovic was previously the subject of the sports documentary “Becoming Zlatan” (pictured) which was released around the world in 2016 and was a box office success in many countries, including Sweden.
Nohrborg, who is also the CEO of Swedish distribution banner Tri Art Film, recently acquired a raft of French films, including Xavier Legrand's “Custody,” Emmanuel Finkiel's “La Douleur,” based on Marguerite Durras's book, and Xavier Beauvois's “Les gardiennes.”
Over at Goteborg, Nohrborg and his fellow producer at B-Reel Films, Frida Bargo, presented several projects at the Nordic Film Lab, including Peter Grönlund's sophomore feature “Goliath” which was one of the highlights of the work-in-progress section.
Everyone wants to have a financially secure retirement, but to get there, you'll have to save and plan. Just getting started with a retirement savings strategy can be the hardest part of getting on the road to retiring richer.

The following tips can help you boost your savings without feeling like you're sacrificing and give you the mental shove forward you need to keep up your momentum in striving toward your financial goals.

1. Save half your raises
The best way to save money is before you think you have it. That's a big reason why so many employers have moved toward automatically enrolling their employees in 401(k) retirement plans, because it gets workers into the habit of saving, sometimes without even realizing it.
Yet the problem with most automatic enrollment plans is that they start you out saving only small amounts of your pay, often 3 percent. You can increase that amount yourself at any time, but your take-home pay will go down as a result.
The simple answer: Wait until you get a raise and boost your contributions at that time. For instance, if you get a 2 percent raise, increase your 401(k) contribution rate by 1 percentage point. That way, half of your raise will go toward your retirement, but you'll still get the psychological boost of seeing your paychecks go up.
2. Invest half of your tax refund
When it comes to saving, big chunks of money that you can potentially set aside are few and far between. One area where many people have an opportunity to do this is with their tax refunds. Millions of taxpayers get refunds of $1,000 or more each year. For someone making near the typical household income of around $50,000, saving half of a $1,000 tax refund is the same as boosting your 401(k) contribution by 1 percentage point.
Again, you could save all of your refund instead of half, but where many people get bogged down in their savings strategy is that they get tired of never getting any immediate reward for their efforts. By hanging on to a portion of your refund, you'll get the payoff now while also setting yourself up for future success.

3. Set aside half your side-job earnings
Working a second job has been a time-honored tradition to save more money, but the rise of the gig economy has made side jobs more popular than ever. With estimates of 40 to 50 million Americans taking on work on the side to earn more money, there are ample opportunities to boost your income.
Admittedly, many people work second jobs because they must in order to make ends meet. But if your most important long-term priority is putting yourself in position to retire as rich as possible, taking a portion of your earnings from a side job can be a great way to supplement the savings from your primary employment and get your retirement nest egg growing that much faster.
Gain without pain
Retiring rich is just a dream for many Americans, but you can make it a reality -- if you're committed to it. Yet saving for retirement doesn't have to be painful. By making incremental changes like the ones mentioned above, you'll be able to reach your financial goals more easily over the long haul.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's two main anti-establishment parties could yet form a government, after the man nominated as interim prime minister said politicians, rather than technocrats like himself, might be able to steer the country out of deadlock.
Wednesday's development came as financial markets calmed after a rout a day earlier when investor concerns about Italy's finances gave the yield on Italian 2-year bonds its biggest rise since 1992 and dented the euro's exchange rate.
The crisis started when the 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League abandoned their plan to form a coalition after the head of state vetoed their choice of 81-year-old eurosceptic economist Paolo Savona as finance minister.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister-designate Carlo Cottarelli said possibilities had emerged “for the birth of a political government,” and that financial market turmoil and other circumstances, “have caused me to wait for further developments.”
A source close to President Sergio Mattarella, who vetoed Savona as finance minister and appointed Cottarelli to form a government to oversee fresh elections around the end of the year, said the two men had “decided together not to rush things, (to favour) a possible political government”.
A source close to 5-Star, which emerged from inconclusive elections in March the single-biggest party in parliament, said the parties were now trying to find “a point of compromise on another name” for the economy ministry.
Laura Castelli, a lawmaker close to 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio, said: “It's surprising that Paolo Savona, a person of great culture and a fine political sense, has not yet taken the decision to withdraw.”
But League leader Matteo Salvini, who is surging in opinion polls, played down the notion that he and 5-Star would try again to form a coalition, saying Italy should have a snap election.
“The earlier we vote the better because it's the best way to get out of this quagmire and confusion,” he told reporters.

UNCERTAINTY
On Tuesday, the prospect of a snap election - likely to lead to a eurosceptic government that could put Italy's euro zone membership in question - hit Italian bonds, shares and pushed the euro to multi-month lows.
A surprise breakthrough between the president and 5-Star/League would ease uncertainty but still usher in a coalition planning to ramp up spending in the heavily indebted nation and push for changes to European Union and euro zone fiscal rules.
But even with uncertainty remaining, Italy's government bond yields fell from multi-year highs on Wednesday and a smooth bond auction brought a degree of calm to a battered market.
“We are not yet at the point where investors refuse to lend money to Italy,” said Roberto Coronado of PineBridge Investments.
In Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz played down the risk of the Italian crisis engulfing the currency area.
“One can say that Europe is better prepared for difficult situations than before. What is more, I am firmly convinced that the majority of Italians have a very pro-European stance. It is a European nation,” he told Reuters.

HOUSTON -- A former Texans employee alleges she was sexually harassed by the team's former director of football operations and that the team did not respond properly when notified of the allegations.
In a lawsuit filed Friday, Kristen Grimes alleges that former director of football operations Jason Lowrey was part of an "Alpha-Male environment, where continuous improprieties toward female employees were not punished."
Editor's Picks J.J. Watt's impact on Houston will have lasting effect Texans star J.J. Watt will find out Saturday night if efforts that raised millions to help the Houston area recover earned him a top NFL honor.
She alleges that Lowrey pursued a relationship with her "almost immediately" after she was hired. On a 2013 work trip to Nashville, Tennessee, Grimes alleges that she was groped by Lowrey, with him "openly grabbing her butt." The lawsuit also says that in 2015, after Grimes "attempted to sever" her relationship with Lowrey, he openly stalked her at the workplace.
According to the lawsuit, Grimes filed a complaint with the Texans' human resources department, but "the organization thereafter failed to conduct a proper and unbiased internal investigation of [Grimes'] complaint."
"The Houston Texans also decided not to reprimand or discipline Jason Lowrey in any way, other than to merely make a note of the complaint in his file," the lawsuit states.
According to the Houston Chronicle, the team "parted ways" with Lowrey on Jan. 16.
The Texans released a statement Friday night, acknowledging the lawsuit that was "alleging, among other things, that the club failed to properly investigate and respond to a sexual harassment complaint filed by a former employee in November 2016."
"The Houston Texans take complaints of this nature seriously," the statement said. "Consistent with club policy, this matter was promptly investigated and addressed at the time the complaint was made. We will vigorously defend ourselves against this litigation."

Mark Yeninas and his wife are in Minnesota for the Super Bowl — and it's not costing them anything.
The Hanover Twp. couple won an all-expense-paid trip to the big game through a Pennsylvania Lottery second-chance drawing. They even get $1,500 in spending money as part of the estimated $40,000 prize package.
“It's a once-in-a-lifetime prize,” Yeninas said during a telephone call Thursday afternoon.
Yeninas, 55, and his wife, Susan, arrived at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on Thursday to a big welcome featuring Minnesota Vikings cheerleaders and the team's mascot.
“It was insane,” Yeninas recalled. “They were cheering and yelling, ‘Welcome to Minnesota!'”
‘Win-win' scenario
The couple will be rooting for the New England Patriots on Sunday when they take on the Philadelphia Eagles.
Yeninas said he wants New England to capture a sixth Super Bowl to match Pittsburgh so his buddies who root for the Steelers don't have sole bragging rights. His wife is just a big fan of legendary Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, he said.
He knows they will likely be in the minority as support seems to be building behind the underdog Eagles, a franchise that has never won a Super Bowl.
“On the plane, I didn't see any Patriots fans. Even the pilot made reference to ‘Fly Eagles Fly' when we landed,” Yeninas recalled.
However, Yeninas said he'll be happy with any outcome
“It's a win-win. I'm going to see sports history made either way,” he said. “I'm either going to see the Eagles win their first Super Bowl or Tom Brady get his sixth”
Luck after lottery loss
Yeninas believes he won the lottery's second-chance drawing by entering a losing daily number ticket.
He actually is more of a third-chance winner.
When Yeninas got an email claiming he was one of the grand prize winners, he checked the lottery website and didn't see his name among the 10 winners listed. He wondered if the email could be a scam, but was soon assured when he called an official lottery phone number.
“A lot of the skepticism went away when I called the lottery and the guy said, ‘Congratulations, I was the one who just sent you that email,'” Yeninas said.
He was told he won because one or more of the original winners didn't reply within six days to email sent by the lottery, the method used to notify winners. Those signing up for second-chance drawings via the Pennsylvania Lottery VIP Players Club are asked to provide an email address as a contact.
“He said you have six days to get the paperwork in. I said don't worry, I will,” Yeninas said.
VIP treatment
Yeninas, his wife and other Pennsylvania Lottery trip winners are staying at an extended-stay hotel in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, about 20 miles from U.S. Bank Stadium, where the game will be held.
Their package includes VIP tickets to the opening event to Super Bowl LII weekend — today's Pro Football Hall of Fame Merlin Olsen Luncheon at the Hyatt Hotel in Minneapolis. During the event, which normally costs $1,250 per person, guests get to hear stories from and meet NFL Hall of Famers.
Yeninas said he isn't sure yet where his seats for the game are, but they are in the lower level.
He said his wife will be wearing a Tom Brady No. 12 jersey, while he'll be wearing a neon green shirt.
“I wanted to wear it so I could tell people where I'm sitting and maybe they could find me on television,” Yeninas said.

The Vancouver Canucks finished 29th in the NHL last season and struggled in just about every aspect of the game, especially the power play. In the past two seasons, the Canucks scored on 15% of their power plays — the worst percentage in the league.
The problem boils down to a few areas ranging from shot attempts to what side players are shooting from on the power play. It was hard to watch last season, especially as none of the Canucks' coaching staff could fix the problems.
A few off-season signings and the development of a handful of players over the past year has breathed life into the Canucks' special teams and they will find success this season.
Vancouver Canucks: 3 Stats that must improve in 2018 https://t.co/xo8rGWfyML via @fsthecanuckway pic.twitter.com/FxFIwBfzpu — FanSided NHL (@FanSidedNHL) September 7, 2017
The Problems
In the 2015-16 season, the Canucks finished 28th in the NHL in shots on goal with 2,311. Last season, they dropped to dead last with a meager 2,273. You can't score if you don't shoot, so naturally, the Canucks ranked 29th in goals scored during the 2016-17 season. This was even more apparent on their dismal power play that had no true shooters.
Also, having a blend of righties and lefties on your power play and using them effectively is pivotal to success. The Canucks did not do this in the slightest and often tried to force predictable shots. Having players on their off-wing sitting on the hash marks is what makes a power play work in this NHL era.
For example, look at the 2016-17 Pittsburgh Penguins who had Evgeni Malkin (lefty) on the right hash marks and Phil Kessel (righty) on the left hash marks. This opened them up for one-timers on both sides and gave the power play flexibility to move the puck. They made defenders wary while getting goaltenders to move laterally. The Penguins finished second in the NHL in power play goals, and of course went on to hoist the Stanley Cup.
Perhaps the Canucks' biggest issue on the power play was the zone entry — my goodness was it ever predictable. How many times did Daniel or Henrik Sedin pick the puck up behind the net, skate up to center and then drop it for Alex Edler to take into the zone? This tactic can be viable but only if your puck carrier heads up ice with speed and purpose like Dustin Byfuglien of the Winnipeg Jets.
The Solutions
Obviously, the only way to increase the Canucks' shot totals is by shooting the puck more. Showing confidence in players like Brock Boeser, Sven Baertschi and Bo Horvat should have them directing more pucks at the cage.
Additionally, bringing in players like Sam Gagner and Thomas Vanek was a huge step in the right direction for a successful power play. Gagner and Vanek are both right-handed shots with plenty of skill and proven abilities for hitting the score sheet.
On that same note, the development of righties like Troy Stecher and Boeser will increase the balance of righties and lefties and offensive production on the roster. Being a defenceman, Stecher's development as a right-handed shot is vital for the future of the Canucks' production on the back end.
There is no definitive solution to the Canucks' predictability entering the zone. However, I'd start by not letting Edler quarterback the power play. He's a good player but he is not fast enough nor talented enough to weave through traffic with the puck on a string and establish a setup. Stecher has the speed and is developing his skill to a point where he just might be the new quarterback.
We'll have to see how coach Travis Green handles the strategic elements of the power play but the new-found balance of skilled righties and lefties is perhaps just what he needs to orchestrate a successful power play. It won't be the best power play in the league, but it has the potential to jump to a middle-of-the-pack position — a huge leap from being the worst.

Port Augusta is about to get a $650 million, 150-megawatt solar thermal power plant - with plans to have it up and running by 2020. South Australia Premier Jay Weatherill announced that the plant could lead to lower power prices, as well as supplying all of the power needed for state government projects.
But what do experts have to say?
As reported by the ABC, the plant will be the biggest of its kind in the world.
Wasim Saman is a Professor of Sustainable Energy Engineering at the University of South Australia
This is first large scale application of solar thermal generation in Australia which has been operating successfully in Europe, USA and Africa. The significance of solar thermal generation lies in its ability to provide energy virtually on demand through the use of thermal energy storage to store heat for running the power turbines. This is a substantially more economical way of storing energy than using batteries. While this technology is perhaps a decade behind solar PV generation, many future world energy forecasts include a considerable proportion of this technology in tomorrow's energy mix.
Dr Matthew Stocks is a Research Fellow in the Research School of Engineering at The Australian National University
We have lots to learn about how solar thermal can contribute to a stable, low cost, low emission electrical system, and the announced system will be an important step in understanding the potential of solar thermal. One of the big challenges for solar thermal as a storage tool is that it can only store heat. If there is an excess of electricity in the system because the wind is blowing strong, it cannot efficiently use it to store electrical power to shift the energy to times of shortage, unlike batteries and pumped hydro. It is not yet clear whether it will deliver a better outcome than wind and solar with electrical storage.
Honorary Associate Professor Hugh Saddler is a Research Associate at the Centre for Climate Economy and Policy, at The Australian National University
This concentrating solar thermal power station will be Australia's first major solar thermal power station. This will make it one of the most important milestones along Australia's transition to a low emission electricity system. The project will deliver both direct generation of electricity when the sun is shining plus up to eight hours of molten salt thermal energy storage. The storage will allow the power station to keep supplying electricity at full capacity for some hours after the sun has set and peak evening demand for electricity has passed. It will thus combine both generation and storage in the one plant, greatly enhancing the reliability and security of the electricity grid in SA. At a reported 125 MW it will be large enough to supply 5 per cent of the state's current total daily electricity consumption. The reported contract price to the state government of $78 per MWh is not much higher than recent contract wind generation prices and at or below prices for electricity from current solar photovoltaic power stations, neither of which include energy storage. It is also well below the estimated cost of any new coal fired power station in Australia, and well below the spot wholesale price of electricity in the SA market region, which has averaged between $110 and $120 per MWh since March this year.
Dr Ariel Liebman is the Deputy Director for Monash Energy Materials and Systems Institute (MEMSI), at Monash University
The Port Augusta Solar Thermal plant will be a great complement to the range of new technologies now in South Australia and the rest of the nation such as wind, solar PV and electric battery such as the Neoen/Tesla battery announced last month. Solar thermal with storage is an ideal partner to the other new technologies whose growing deployment is now unstoppable. Being able to store its own energy output in a thermal way (not electrically such as in the case of lithium-ion) makes this a truly dispatchable renewable technology. While this particular project appears to be uneconomic without the state government subsidy, de-risking early stage investment is the government's role and as more deployment of new technologies will bring the cost down as industry learns how to manufacture and deploy at scale. We need the most diverse mix of technologies possible if we are to ensure we limit climate change based temperature rises to two degrees if not 1.5 degrees. It will add to the downward pressure on wholesale energy prices although at the size of 150 MW, the impact will be quite small and it is unlikely to be felt in the end-consumer bill, particularly as the majority of the retail electricity price rises seen over the past ten years have little to do with the cost of energy generation but more to do with failures in retail competition as well and wholesale market ownership concentration and insufficient transmission inter-connector capacity in the National Electricity Market.
Dr Mark Diesendorf is Associate Professor and Deputy Director of the Institute of Environmental Studies at the University of New South Wales
An excellent decision! Port Augusta's concentrated solar thermal power station with thermal storage will be a dispatchable source of renewable power. In other words, it will supply power on demand. Along with the Tesla battery and open-cycle gas turbines, it will balance the fluctuations of the variable renewable energy sources, wind and solar PV.

The 5-day Book Fair-2018 started at Expo Centre, here on Friday.
Provincial Education Minister Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan inaugurated the book fair and visited different stalls. He appreciated the holding of book fair every year and said that such events play an important role in promoting habit of books-reading among people.
He commended the presence of youth, especially students at the venue, and said that books help broaden intellectual ken of the budding minds by giving them new ideas and vision.
In fact, books promote healthy social behaviour in society by sensitising readers about positive aspects of life, he added.
Book Fair Coordinator Muhammad Nazeer told media persons that 270 publishers, book-sellers and government departments had set up their stalls at the book fair, which would conclude on Feb 6.
The Lahore International Book Fair Trust has organised the event in collaboration with Pakistan Publishers and Booksellers Association, he added.
Your private emails are being read by third-party Gmail app developers, an investigation into data privacy has revealed. Developers behind a number of popular online services designed to work with Gmail trawl through private messages sent and received from your email address, it claims. It is common practice for some of these third-party app creators to instruct employees to read personal emails. One app, which is designed to help users manage their Gmail inbox, lets employees read ‘thousands' of emails, the Wall Street Journal investigation found.According to experts, this ‘dirty secret' is now common practice among some firms.
The revelation comes just a few months after it was revealed political data firm Cambridge Analytica had siphoned private data from third-party apps on Facebook. According to the investigation into Gmail, the hugely-successful Google email client allows third-party developers to scan the inbox of anyone who installs their app.
These apps can provide additional functionality to the Gmail inbox, like the ability to compare prices from different online retailers, or quickly unsubscribe from any marketing emails sent to your address.
The Wall Street Journal report was based on the testimonies of more than two dozen employees of companies who create services around Gmail – the most popular email service in the world.

"The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions."
In a rare move, the National Rifle Association issued a statement calling for regulation of the device that turned the Las Vegas shooter's rifles more deadly, blaming Barack Obama's administration for its approval.
"Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions, the National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law," the NRA wrote in a statement. "The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations."
A bump or fire stock is a device that allows rifles to fire bullets as quickly as a machine gun. At least 12 of the Las Vegas shooter's guns were outfitted with them.
But did Obama approve their legality? Sort of, but approved is probably the wrong word.
NRA spokeswoman Amy Hunter pointed us to a June 2010 approval letter from ATF, an agency under executive purview, sent to Slide Fire, a bump stock manufacturer. Spelling out the legal definition of a firearm, ATF's technology chief John Spencer determined it was not regulated by law.
"The stock has no automatically functioning mechanical parts or springs and performs no automatic mechanical function when installed," Spencer wrote. "Accordingly, we find that the ‘bump-stock' is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act."
Bump stocks harness a weapon's recoil to cause the user's finger to squeeze the trigger repeatedly, but because they don't alter the gun's internal mechanisms, they were considered lawful.
We found a similar 2012 letter addressed to Bump Fire, a competing manufacturer.
But just as these bump stocks didn't qualify for regulation, two similar devices did.
The difference? The Akins Accelerator and the Autoglove were determined in 2007 and 2017, respectively, to have mechanical parts that enhanced the trigger mechanism, making them by definition machineguns.
"Electrically-driven trigger devices are considered ‘machineguns' because they are a ‘combination of parts designed and intended, for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun,' " ATF's letter to AutoGlove read.
Automatic weapons sales have been restricted since the 1934 National Firearms Act, and 1986 regulations made it much harder for civilians to get an automatic weapon like a machine gun.
Obama administration's role
Experts in firearm policy were divided when we asked about the fairness of the NRA's characterization.
Adam Winkler, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in guns, said it was appropriate to characterize the move as an approval of its sale under the Obama administration.
"Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it," Winkler said.
Other legal experts stressed that it wasn't an approval, but rather a determination that current law didn't allow for its regulation.
"The statement implies Obama or (U.S. Attorney General Eric) Holder was somehow involved, and that it was an issue that wouldn't have been approved in any other administration, and that's technically incorrect," said Rick Vasquez, a former Firearms Technology Branch official who first signed off on the recommendation the ATF could not regulate the Slide Fire.
"We never had any political people come down to our office saying we must or must not approve (the Slide Fire)," Vasquez said.
Obama issued a slew of executive orders promoting stricter gun control, which the Trump administration has been rolling back, including a measure that previously prevented people with mental illness from buying guns.
"I believe (the NRA) were stating that just to point out that this wasn't some rogue decision made during a Republican administration, which would be more friendly to gun owners, and therefore that when they re-evaluate it, they're going to have to take a really close look at the law," said John Pierce, a lawyer and advocate for gun rights.
In order to re-evaluate the bump stock, Vasquez said the ATF would have to change the way it interpreted the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation that would allow the device to be regulated.
Our ruling
The NRA said, "The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions."
We indeed found two occasions in which ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration.
These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It's important to note this was not a statement of Obama's preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law.
We rate this statement Mostly True.

ISLAMABAD, April 17 (APP): Some 152 Facebook pages
have been blocked during action against the social media sites having blasphemous contents.
It was stated in a written reply by Minister for Interior to
a question raised during 4th sitting of 41st session of
National Assembly. The Lower House was informed that matter has
been taken up with relevant US authorities to help close
down blasphemous social media platform and trace out the
persons involved.
The minister said that three accused persons have been arrested
by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and eight persons were
placed on Exit Control List (ECL).
Chaudhry Nisar in a written reply said that he held meeting with
ambassadors of Muslim countries for orchestrating an
effective collective response of Muslim countries against the
social media platform that host blasphemous material.
He said that Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent letters to
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) and the Arab League
for collective efforts.
The minister said that Facebook authorities have been requested to
visit Pakistan for taking speedy action against blasphemous sites.
He said a video conference was held by Secretary Interior and Chairman
Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) with Facebook authorities to find out permanent solution against the menace of blasphemy on April 7.
Chaudhry Nisar said that Chairman PTA has contacted his counterparts in
brotherly Muslim countries for formulating a collective response against blasphemous sites.
He said that inter-ministerial consultation is being held for assessing
the existing legal regime and providing suitable amendments to various laws and stringent legal framework for investigating and nabbing culprits.
The minister said that a writ petition filed against concerned federal
government ministries was disposed off by Islamabad High Court. The court appreciated the efforts on the measures taken by the government for expeditious and effective response of government team, spearheaded by the Ministry of Interior.
Nearly five decades after John Lennon released “Imagine”, his wife and musical collaborator, Yoko Ono, has been officially credited as a co-writer of the song.
According to Variety, the National Music Publishers Association announced the news during a gala held in Ono's honor in New York City on Wednesday. Along with the songwriting credit, Ono received the organization's Centennial Song Award.
(Read: The 100 Greatest Songs of All Time)
NMPA CEO David Israelite said the organization's decision was in accordance with Lennon's own wishes. Israelite specifically cited a 1980 interview in which Lennon credited Ono as an influence and inspiration for the song.
Beyond the personal accolade for Ono, the NMPA's decision has major ramifications for the song's copyright. As Variety notes, a song enters the public domain 70 years after the death of its last creator. The addition of Ono means the song's copyright has been extended by a minimum of 37 years (Lennon died in 1980). And with Ono still very much alive and screeching, it may another century before “Imagine” enters the public domain.

Kolkata and Delhi lead the list of cities that would benefit the most from accelerated emission cuts. Photo: HT
New Delhi: At least 153 million premature deaths linked to air pollution could be avoided across major urban areas worldwide this century if governments across the world speed up their plans to cut fossil fuel emissions, said a new study released on Monday.
Kolkata and Delhi lead the list of cities that would benefit the most from accelerated emission cuts, with 8.8 million projected lives saved. In India, according to the study, a total of 25.72 million premature deaths can be avoided across 18 cities, which includes Patna, Mumbai, Lucknow, Agra, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Bengaluru, Chennai and others.
It stressed that premature deaths would decline in cities on every inhabited continent with the greatest gains in saved lives occurring in Asia and Africa. The study by US-based Duke University was published in the journal, Nature Climate Change, on Monday.
It claimed to be the first one to project the number of lives that could be saved, city by city, in 154 of the world's largest urban areas if nations agree to reduce emissions and limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius in the near future rather than postponing the biggest emissions cuts until later, as some governments have proposed.
“Kolkata and Delhi, India, lead the list of cities benefitting from accelerated emissions cuts with up to 4.4 million projected saved lives and up to 4 million projected saved lives, respectively. Thirteen other Asian or African cities could each avoid more than 1 million premature deaths and around 80 additional cities could each avoid at least 100,000 deaths,” the study said.
Nearly 50 urban areas in other continents could see gains in numbers of saved lives, with six cities—Moscow, Mexico City, São Paulo, Los Angeles, Puebla and New York—each potentially avoiding between 320,000 and 120,000 premature deaths. In December 2015, under the Paris Agreement, the world agreed to limit rise in global temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial times and make efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100.

BERLIN (Reuters) - North Korea has been using its embassy in Berlin to procure parts for its missile programme, the head of Germany's BfV domestic intelligence agency told a German broadcaster.
No one at the North Korean embassy in Berlin was immediately available to comment on the allegation.
In a programme to be aired on NDR television on Monday, BfV head Hans-Georg Maassen said: “We determined that procurement activities have been carried out from there that are, in our view, done with a view to the missile programme and sometimes also for the nuclear programme.”
He said it was often so-called dual use goods, which can be used for both civil and military purposes.
Comments released by NDR ahead of the broadcast showed Maassen said German authorities prevented such activities when they found them but he added: “We can't guarantee that we can detect and prevent this in all cases.”
He said it was necessary to presume that parts for North Korea's launch programme “were acquired via other markets or underground buyers had acquired them in Germany”.
North Korea has defied years of multilateral and bilateral sanctions with a weapons programme aimed at developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.

CHARLOTTE, North Carolina, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Highlights of the second round of the 99th PGA Championship at Quail Hollow on Friday:
Failing light ends play in second round
Players with one hole left ran to their last tee to fire off a shot before the horn sounded to suspend play for the day so they would be allowed to finish the hole and their round, and not have to return early on Saturday to complete it.
With darkness falling, Jason Day parred the 18th to register a five-under 66 for a six-under-par total, two shots off the pace. Louis Oosthuizen parred the ninth to post 67 and finish the round on five-under.
Matsuyama completes 64, ties Kisner for halfway lead
Matsuyama sees his birdie streak snapped with a par at the par-four 16th before resuming his torrid back nine with another birdie at 17 on his way to a flawless seven-under 64 that ties him with Kisner at eight-under 134 through 36 holes.
Play resumes, Matsuyama birdies again
Matsuyama chips from greenside rough at the par-five 15 to two feet and sinks the putt after play resumed following a one hour 43-minute delay for his fourth birdie in a row. The Japanese moves to seven-under, one stroke from leader Kisner.
Play suspended due to lightning
After the weather held for most of the afternoon, the luck finally ran out, with approaching thunderstorms forcing play to be suspended at 4.43 p.m. local time (2043 GMT). An approaching storm from the south led to the decision.
--
Matsuyama, Day make move
The stoppage is probably not what Hideki Matsuyama and Jason Day wanted. Japanese Matsuyama had picked up three straight birdies to jump into second place at six-under after 14 holes, with Australian Day in third place at five-under after 10 holes.
--
Spieth treads water
In his quest to complete the grand slam, Jordan Spieth is struggling to stay in touch. He made a mess of the par-five 10th and in the end did well to salvage a bogey, slipping 11 strokes from the lead.
--
McIlroy 10 behind after a second straight 72
Rory McIlroy, the pre-championship favourite, had an awful stretch of four bogeys in five holes before fighting back to end his round 10 strokes behind. A birdie putt at the last hung on the lip but did not drop.
--
Kisner stretches lead
The man to catch is American Kevin Kisner, who stayed out of trouble for a second straight 67, a remarkable score given the difficulty of the new greens, which are slippery, fast and rock hard.
--
Fowler moving up
American Rickie Fowler, hoping Quail Hollow will yield his first major championship, is next best in the clubhouse, five shots behind after a 70.
--
The course was set up on Friday at 7,452 yards, more than 100 yards shorter than for the first round. The tees have been moved up significantly on the drivable par-four 14th, which is playing only 289 yards, reachable for the entire field.

A garbage dump landslide in Colombo, Sri Lanks has killed at least 29 people, according to reports. Rescue workers are rushing to find people who may still be trapped under the rubbish which slammed into nearby houses. ( Reuters )
MEETOTAMULLA, SRI LANKA—Rescuers on Monday were digging through heaps of mud and trash that collapsed onto a clutch of homes near a garbage dump outside Sri Lanka's capital, killing at least 30 people and possibly burying dozens more. Hundreds of people had been living in the working-class neighbourhood on the fringe of the towering dump in Meetotamulla, a town near Colombo, when a huge mound collapsed Friday night during a celebration for the local new year, damaging at least 150 homes. By Monday morning, authorities had pulled the bodies from beneath the debris, according to a Disaster Management Center report. Authorities were unsure how many more people could still be trapped, with contradictory reports being released. They announced 30 people were missing Monday but later reduced the number to 11. Disaster Management Center spokesman Pradeep Kodippili said the number was reduced after adjusting names that had been entered on the list of dead as well as missing. Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said the number of people could be between six and 10.

Those homes now lay in piles of collapsed concrete walls encased in a wall of mud up to 8 metres high and mixed with plastic bags, broken glass and other trash. Bicycles and auto-rickshaws, the three-wheeled vehicles used as local taxis, were crushed or lying topsy-turvy. In other parts of the dump officials were mapping places that can slide and identifying families that need to be evacuated.
More than 600 of the area's residents were sheltering in nearby schools, while 11 people were being treated at a hospital for injuries. One auto-rickshaw driver described a narrow escape. He was returning home with his wife, two sons and daughter when they stepped out from his rickshaw and his daughter said the ground seemed to be moving beneath her feet. “There was a strong wind from the side of the dump, and my daughter shouted that the mound is splitting,” Rasika Sanjeewa, 41, said Monday. “Suddenly, one slice of the mound came crashing down. The whole area was shaking.” Debris blocked them from fleeing immediately, but eventually they found a way out, Sanjeewa said. When they arrived later at their friends' home, where they had planned to celebrate the new year, they found it buried and their friends dead — a mother and daughter who worked as daily wage labourers. The prime minister vowed over the weekend to shut down the dump, which has absorbed much of Colombo's garbage over several years amid heavy construction and renovations in the capital. As the garbage piled up, it began threatening the nearby homes, prompting residents to stage regular protests while complaining of health hazards. “These people did not choose to live next to a dump. But they brought the garbage in and made this place horrible,” said rickshaw driver Dilip Mirmal, 34, whose home was spared while those surrounding were completely subsumed. He counted 23 of his neighbours among the dead. “This is a government-made disaster,” he said. “I have a mix of feelings — of anger, frustration and sorrow. We have been trying to protest and raise these issues, but no one was listening.”

NHL players have begun to prepare themselves for the next NHL lockout. In recent years, there has been a drastic uptick in the number of NHL contracts that have a significant portion of the compensation paid in the form of signing bonuses rather than base salary alone. This increase in the number of bonus heavy contracts seems to point to a widespread concern among NHL players about the possibility of another season lost due to a lockout. From the moment the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) was signed, there has been rampant speculation that another substantial work stoppage is likely. Now it appears that the players have begun to actively plan for that eventuality.
How Do NHL Signing Bonuses Work?
To see how signing bonuses play a role in future CBA negotiations, and a potential lockout, it is important to first to understand what these signing bonuses really are.
In more traditional businesses signing bonuses are paid once an employee signs a contract with the company. These bonuses are often paid to entice the employee to take a reduced salary, or otherwise lessened benefit package. Though each contract is unique and may have other specific requirements, signing bonuses are generally payable irrespective of the performance of the contract.
NHL signing bonuses are similar but there is one very important difference. Traditional signing bonuses are paid as a single lump-sum payment. NHL signing bonuses may be paid in multiple installments of varying amounts across multiple contract years, typically when the new league year begins on July 1. While these bonuses may vary from season to season, they are still included when calculating the annual average value of the contract for salary cap purposes. For example, Artemi Panarin's contract for the 2018-19 season has a base salary of $4 million and a signing bonus of $2 million, for a total annual salary of $6 million.
The most important thing to remember about these signing bonuses is that while they may vary in size and structure from contract to contract, in general, they will be paid out whether or not the player ever plays a single game for the team. This includes if a season is delayed, shortened, or canceled for any reason, including a work stoppage. The way these bonuses are paid has been prominently on display recently. Prior to being traded, the trade rumors that swirled around Ryan O'Reilly focused on his high signing bonus, and whether the Buffalo Sabres or the prospective acquiring teams would be responsible for paying it. Buffalo and St. Louis were able to complete the trade for the talented center on July 1, allowing the responsibility for paying the bonus to also transfer to St. Louis.

Players Are Preparing for a Lockout
The opening of Free Agency this year featured a perfect high profile example of a contract loaded with signing bonuses; John Tavares' new contract with his hometown Toronto Maple Leafs. As Pierre LeBrun reported, Tavares' 11-year deal contains just $6.11 million in base salary, which is less than 8% of the total value of the contract. In fact, in the first year, Tavares will make only $650,000 in base salary. This is the equivalent of the league minimum. Because the contract is over 92% bonuses, Tavares is guaranteed $70.89 million in signing bonuses over the life of the contract, whether or not he ever plays a single game.
Correction on Year 2 signing bonus, it's $14.99M, not $15.25M. So official breakdown reads like this: Year 1, $650k salary, $15.25M sb; Year 2, $910k salary, $14.99 M sb; Year 3, $910k salary, $11.09M sb; Year 4, $910k salary, $8.44M sb; Years 5-7, $910k salary, $7.04M sb each yr https://t.co/fqt0dFwl4K — Pierre LeBrun (@PierreVLeBrun) July 1, 2018
John Tavares is not the only high profile player to agree to a contract with a significant signing bonus. Jakub Voracek, Jamie Benn, Carey Price, Steven Stamkos, and Connor McDavid are just a handful of recent examples of star players who have signed these sorts of contracts. While all of the deals these players signed contain substantial bonuses, they are all structured very differently. Some of the contracts have the signing bonuses in every year, providing guaranteed money throughout the life of the deal, while others have been structured simply to be “lockout-proof.”
Leon Draisaitl and his agents negotiated what may be the prototypical lockout-proof contract. Draisaitl's compensation is paid exclusively through the base salary in most of the years. He has a base salary of $9 million in 2018-19, $9 million in 2019-20, $8 million in 2021-22, $8 million in 2023-24, and $8 million in 2024-25. There are no bonuses payable in these seasons. However, in the two possible lockout seasons, 2020-21 and 2022-23, his base salary drops to $2 million and $1 million respectively with signing bonuses of $7 million in each of those years. His contract structure dictates that, whether or not there is a lockout, he is guaranteed to be paid $7 million for those seasons.
Victor Hedman and his agents took a slightly different approach to guarantee his security regardless of the specifics of any new CBA. In addition to signing bonuses in 2020-21 and 2022-23, Hedman's contract also has signing bonuses in 2023-23 and 2024-25. It is impossible to predict what a new CBA might entail and how it might change the way players are paid. This structure adds additional security and ensures Hedman will be well paid those amounts no matter the outcome of a new Collective Bargaining Agreement.
NHL Showdown Ahead
The CBA is set to expire on September 15, 2022. However, the terms of the current agreement would extend on a year-to-year basis from that date, unless the league or NHL Players Association (NHLPA) give written notice by May 18, 2022, that they intend to terminate the agreement. This date is crucial.
Of late, one key point of the CBA has become widely reported. Section 3.1 paragraph (b) of the CBA is the so-called opt-out clause that gives the league and the NHLPA the right to terminate the agreement before the start of the 2020-21 season.
Even more foreboding was the recent failed attempt to extend the current CBA. The league made an offer to allow players to participate in the Olympics in South Korea, in exchange for extending the current CBA by three years. The NHLPA rejected the offer due to a variety of concerns about the current deal, not the least of which is the mandated escrow payments by the players. This may seem trivial, it may also serve as the canary in the coal mine that points to trouble ahead.
The NHLPA remembers how much their bargaining power was hurt during previous lockouts with much of their membership desperate to get back on the ice and the players undoubtedly haven't forgotten how much lighter their pocketbooks were. During the 2005-06 lockout and the shortened season in 2012-13, only a handful of players is fortunate enough to have the sort of security that signing bonuses afford. Today many players are doing everything they can to make sure that won't be the case again.
At the same time, the negotiations that followed the cancellation of the 2004-05 season were a huge success for Commissioner Gary Bettman. He was able to shepherd in the current CBA, and it not only instituted the hard salary cap owners were clamoring for, but it also reduced player salaries by more than 20%. These were both tremendous wins for ownership.
These massive victories were the direct result of Bettman's hardline negotiating tactics and his willingness to cancel an entire season to get what the owners wanted. Bettman remained steadfast and unwavering while hundreds of players were out of work and desperate to return. The pressure on the NHLPA to get players back on the ice was what gave Bettman and the league the leverage they needed to ask for everything they could possibly want and get it.
As more and more players continue to sign contracts with significant signing bonuses, the leverage that made the NHL so successful in past negotiations is slipping away. Commissioner Bettman garnered tremendous support from the owners because of his deft handling of previous negotiations. If teams continue to hand out massive signing bonuses, particularly for years in which a work stoppage is likely, Bettman will struggle to retain even a portion of the leverage he once had. These contracts and the bonuses they carry will drastically alter the balance of power at the negotiating table and will affect the NHL for years to come.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and South Korea have agreed to resume joint military drills early next month, the Pentagon said, a move that was expected despite U.S. President Donald Trump's planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Seoul and Washington said in January they would delay the annual exercises, known as Key Resolve and Foal Eagle, until after the Olympics and Paralympics held in South Korea, helping to create conditions for a resumption of talks between South and North Korea, which sees the drills as a rehearsal for invasion.
The exercises are expected to begin on April 1, and will be of a “scale similar to that of the previous years,” the U.S. military said in a statement late on Monday.
“Our combined exercises are defence-oriented and there is no reason for North Korea to view them as a provocation,” Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a separate statement.
The Pentagon said the North Korean military had been notified about the schedule for the drills by the United Nations Command. Logan said the drills were expected to conclude toward the end of May.
Logan said the two joint drills, which include computer simulations and field exercises, would involve about 23,700 U.S. troops and 300,000 South Korea forces.
He said they had been long planned and were not a response to any specific North Korean actions or the current situation on the Korean Peninsula.
After the announcement of the postponement of the drills in January, Pyongyang agreed to hold the first official talks with Seoul in more than two years and to send athletes to the Winter Olympics, easing a standoff over North Korea's development of nuclear weapons.
The intra-Korean talks led to a visit this month by a South Korean delegation to Pyongyang for a meeting with the North Korean leader. The delegation said Kim committed to denuclearisation and expressed eagerness to meet Trump as soon as possible, an offer the president quickly accepted.
South Korean official have said Kim is expected to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April before meeting Trump before the end of May.
DRILLS DENOUNCED IN PAST
The head of the South Korean delegation also said that Kim had said he understood that the joint U.S.-South Korean exercises had to continue.
North Korea has angrily denounced the drills in the past.
Pyongyang has not confirmed the reported remarks by Kim to the South Korean delegation and threatened earlier in the month to “counter the U.S.” if the exercises went ahead.
In January, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the decision to delay the drills was because of logistical concerns, since many South Korean security forces would be occupied with protecting the Olympics.
In 2017, the joint drills ran from March 1 to April 30, and included the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no U.S. aircraft carrier would take part this year, which he said was according to plan and not related to the political situation.

A Mexican presidential candidate suggested cutting off the hands of thieves during a debate on Sunday.
On Monday, a dismembered body appeared in Acapulco with a sign alluding to the candidate's comments.
Crime is on the rise in Mexico, but candidates have offered few new ideas to address it.
Few new ideas were offered by Mexico's presidential candidates during the first debate of the campaign on Sunday night, but one comment aroused surprise and anger around the country.
"We have to cut off the hands of those who rob. It's that simple," Jaime Rodriguez, or "El Bronco," a former Nuevo Leon state governor running as an independent, said during a discussion about corruption. He added he would ask Congress to pass a law backing the idea.
The moderator, taken aback by the comment, twice asked him if he was speaking literally and then checked again if he really meant it.
"That's right. That's right," Rodriguez replied. "Literally," he added, making a chopping motion with his hand.
He was repudiated for the comment, which was quickly mocked by Mexicans. But he doubled-down after the debate, and hours later, one of the gangs that have proliferated around the country in recent years appeared to endorse it with a grisly display.

Next to a dismembered body left on the outskirts of Acapulco on Monday morning, authorities found a sign reading, "El Bronco already said it: cutting off the hands of the scum who steal here is the first thing." The slain man's head, arms, and legs were recovered, but the torso was not found, according to Proceso.
The sign was attributed to Los Enterradores, possibly one of many criminal groups that have appeared around Acapulco, a once idyllic resort area that has been called "Guerrero's Iraq." Other signs found near the scene referenced taxes, or "quotas," levied by criminal groups on activities in areas under their control.
Such messages, often called "narcomantas," are frequently found at the scene of drug- or organized-crime-related violence in Mexico and were often seen during peak years of cartel bloodshed around 2011.
They are usually meant to claim credit for some action or as a warning to rivals or authorities. In some cases, criminal groups have left them on territory controlled by enemies to draw authorities' attention there.
In other instances, narcomantas have been left with bodies left in highly visible public areas, as was the case at a pedestrian overpass near the border in Tijuana at the end of 2016 or at several bridges near tourist areas in Baja California Sur in December 2017. The latter incident was the first time that state had seen such displays.

Acapulco has been a focal point for violence in Mexico in recent years, with the highest homicide rate among Mexican cities five times between 2011 and 2016. In 2016 the city had 918 homicides, rising to 1,096 last year.
Much of the violence is driven by local criminal groups operating in and around Acapulco. The city's port makes territory there valuable, as it allows criminal groups to link up with larger drug-trafficking networks that criss-cross the state and run along the coast. Criminal groups also prey on local businesses and even schools and teachers.
Guerrero, where Acapulco is located, has long been one of the most violent states in Mexico. The number of annual homicide victims there have risen steadily, from 2,016 in 2015 to 2,318 in 2017. Through the first quarter of 2018, the state is on pace for more than 2,600 homicide victims.
'Textbook demagogue'
Rodriguez made history in 2015, when he became the first independent candidate to win a state gubernatorial race, but his political standing has been tarnished in recent years, in part because of incendiary comments, such as saying Mexicans being "too liberal in the topic of faith" led to two earthquakes there in 2017.
He was added to the presidential race — the first such contest in which independent candidates can compete — in April in a decision that surprised many, as the majority of the signatures collected in support of his candidacy were invalidated.
His inclusion was disconcerting for many, as it was seen as most likely to benefit the governing Institutional Political Party — of which he was once a member — by drawing votes away from other candidates. The PRI is currently trailing by a wide margin. Most presidential polls have Rodriguez's likely votership in the single digits.
Mexico does not have the death penalty, but hardline security proposals have won some support at the ballot box in the past. Rodriguez said almost all the 57,000 WhatsApp messages he received about his idea were supportive of it.
Javier Garza, a journalist in the northern city of Torreón, told The Guardian that Rodriguez knew the idea was "a non-starter" but also knew it would generate attention.
"He doesn't have ideas and prefers to play with people's anger instead of offering a serious proposal," Garza added. "Textbook demagogue."

Industrial rock gods Ministry will unleash a new album on the world next year. The band's first release on Nuclear Blast Records is entitled AmeriKKKant and is due out March 9th, 2018.
As is clear from the title, the album is very much influenced by the current political climate. According to frontman Al Jourgensen, the nine-track effort “will provide FEMA-type relief for the devastation ‘Hurricane Cheeto' has brought upon us.” Further details in a press release state that the Jourgensen-produced record will focus on “the waning respect for the US Constitution, the growing acceptance of one's opinions replacing facts, the decline of our leaders' sense of morals, ethics and personal responsibility to the country and to their constituents, and the mad man in the White House.”
As a first listen, Ministry has shared the video for lead single “Antifa”. The chugging thrasher pulls no punches in its anti-fascist statements, with Jourgensen's opening lines saying, “I've got something to say to you/ I'll back it up with my fists/ Sick and tired with dealing with assholes/ That's why I resist.” Take a look at what's clearly trying to become the Antifa Anthem below.
Pre-orders for AmeriKKKant are going on here and via PledgeMusic. Find the album art and tracklist below.

FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan says he has "no concern" about Pro Bowl wide receiver Julio Jones being away from the team during voluntary organized team activities.
Jones has yet to join the team this offseason but has worked out at the University of Alabama, among other places. The organization is aware Jones' absence is tied to wanting a raise with three years and almost $35 million left on his deal, although Jones has not publicly lobbied for a new contract. The Falcons are willing to work with Jones on the contract situation.
Editor's Picks Ricardo Allen keeps business-like approach without contract On a roster with several players awaiting long-term deals, the hard-working safety continues to demonstrate why keeping him should be a priority.
The wide receiver told TMZ last week that he is just trying to work on himself right now and that there is no bad blood with the team.
"No concern," Ryan said Wednesday of Jones' absence. "He's been one of the best competitors I've ever been around. ... He's always been extremely well-prepared, coming into seasons [and] going into games. Talk about being on the same page; we've played together for a long time. When he's healthy and he feels good -- like he does right now, and he's in excellent shape -- it's very easy to get on the same page, he's so talented.
"We're fine. I think we're in a good spot. And we'll get some good work before the season starts, like we always do. We spend time together. And we'll be ready to go when July [training camp] comes up."
Coach Dan Quinn confirmed that Ryan and Jones have gotten together for workouts this offseason, although the quarterback declined to divulge details about those sessions. Quinn said after speaking with Jones that he expects the wide receiver back for mandatory minicamp, which begins June 12.
Ryan was asked if Jones told him the same regarding minicamp.
"You'd have to ask him about that," Ryan said.
Ryan and Jones have played together since the 2011 season, and Ryan emphasized how much the longevity means in terms of chemistry. This will also be their second year together under offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian.
"Julio knows our offense," Ryan said. "He knows where to line up. He knows what route combinations we're going run, the details of the route. Hell, I mean he teaches a lot of our guys the routes too.
"He knows what he's doing. He's in extremely good shape right now and feels really good. So he's going to be just fine."
Quinn downplayed Jones not being around to mentor other players, such as rookie wide receiver Calvin Ridley.
"Julio is one of the best teammates that I've been around," Quinn said. "I already know that he's mentoring [Ridley] in his own way."
Mikes on the Water owner Mike Lefevre and general manager Robert Tondreau plan to open a second-floor patio in the coming days at this St. Clair Shores haven for seafood and more. MIKES ON THE WATER
With summers arrival, the party moves outdoors for many Macomb County dining spots.
Owners of area establishments have worked to provide various amenities for their customers with live entertainment, large-screen TVs for sports viewing and second-floor seating.
Here is a look at popular locations in some Macomb County markets:
 Mount Clemens
As the entertainment capital of Macomb, The Clem has plenty of outdoor places. At the top of the list is Madisons Pub, 15 N. Walnut, which has created an inviting place with live entertainment Thursday-Saturday in a landscaped environment, with plenty of nooks to cozy up in, a fire pit and a smoking section.
Advertisement
But what makes Madisons stand out is the second floor, referred to by customers as the Upper Deck, with cascading lights setting a relaxed atmosphere.
On Friday and Saturday nights, theres a line out the door to get in, said manager Jessica Vescosky.
Down the street, theres Bath City Bistro, 75 Macomb Place, featuring couches and chairs with saxophone music on Saturdays by Anton. At Orleans Sports Cafe, 100 Macomb Place, the garage doors and folding windows open up to a jamming patio with a prime view for the citys outdoor concerts.
The new kid on the block is OHallorans Public House, 112 Macomb Place, offering live entertainment. The owners have plans to further upgrade this facility for next year.
Other great places to enjoy nights in the Clem include Little Lorraines, 86 Macomb Place, Abbibo, 76 Macomb Place, and Three Blind Mice, 100 N. Main Street.
 Roseville
Dooleys Irish Tavern, 32500 Gratiot, and The Spot Bar & Grill, 32456 Gratiot, are located in the same parking lot across from Macomb Mall.
Both have comfortable outdoor settings and have added large-screen TVs for sports viewing and a view of motorists traveling along bustling Gratiot. The Spot also has a laser light show.
 Fraser
At the Vintage House Banquets & Catering, 31816 Utica Road, owner Anthony Jeselnik has created a little oasis with a 5,000-square-foot outdoor garden patio in a wrought iron gazebo that includes a stone fireplace and greenery all around.
 St. Clair Shores
Lets face it  who can go wrong with a view of Lake St. Clair?
Shores residents have at least three venues to choose from in Mikes on the Water, 24600 Jefferson Ave., WaterMark Bar & Grille, 24420 Jefferson, and Brownies on the Lake, 24214 Jefferson, all with gorgeous water views. Mikes on the Water recently constructed a second-floor patio, which is expected to open in coming days.
Although there are no water views, Fishbones Rhythm Kitchen Cafe, 23722 Jefferson, has a hopping patio, too.
 Sterling Heights
Rogers Roost, 33626 Schoenherr, has built a little outdoor haven for their customers to escape the interior bustle. A few blocks away, Johnny Blacks Public House, 35000 Moravian Drive, has two outdoor sections, both of which are noteworthy.
 Utica
Hogs Hollow Smokehouse, 45108 Cass, the gateway to downtown Utica, has a handsome patio close to the Hall Road corridor. Red Ox Tavern, 45411 Park Ave., has a dual-sided fireplace visible from inside or out in the outdoor dining area and heaters in the patio for cool nights.
It is an article of faith among the president's most ardent supporters: The Trump dossier is a completely discredited piece of garbage. Hence, its relevance is limited to one matter and one matter alone: The dossier's suspected use by the Obama administration (specifically, the Justice Department and the FBI) as a pretext to spy on the opposition party's presidential campaign — a ruse that included cribbing the dossier's sensational allegations in secret court applications for wiretap warrants.
It appears that this Trumpist tenet is going to be tested. The dossier that did so much to fuel the collusion controversy is assuming center stage once more.
The dispute over the 2016 election has stalemated. The Trump-deranged are convinced that the president is a Putin puppet; Trump boosters are just as certain that “collusion” is a fictional narrative dreamt up to delegitimize their man and explain away Hillary Clinton's defeat. For a long time, I've thought the latter camp had the better argument. President Trump and the FBI director he fired, James Comey, may not agree on much, but they both say Comey provided repeated assurances that Trump was not a suspect in the FBI's probe of Russia's 2016 campaign meddling. It makes no sense that Comey would do that if there had been solid evidence of collusion between Trump and Putin.
That still seems incontestable. But neither do I believe Director Comey would have countenanced an investigation based on nothing — a “collusion” investigation conducted solely to camouflage political spying. Something is not right here. If we're ever going to figure it out, the dossier is the roadmap.
So, is the article of faith true? If the Trump dossier is just a tissue of lies, why are the Justice Department and FBI, now controlled by Trump appointees, concealing information about it rather than anxiously volunteering disclosure?
If I had to bet on it, I'd wager that the dossier is like many reports compiled by investigative bodies whose motives are dubious and whose sources are of varying levels of credibility — similar to what you get after investigations by politicized congressional committees, law-enforcement agents who are less than first-rate, or private detectives who, lacking subpoena power, often rely on multiple hearsay. That is, I think the dossier will turn out to be a mixed bag of the true, the false, and the shades of gray in between.
Questions about the dossier are pressing for two reasons.
First, it was leaked this week that investigators working with Special Counsel Robert Mueller have interviewed Christopher Steele. He is the former British spy who composed the so-called dossier during and after the 2016 campaign. At the time, Steele was a private contractor conducting political opposition research on behalf of Trump's adversaries. The dossier, formatted to resemble official spy-agency intelligence reports, is a set of investigative summaries, based on Steele's interviews with sources.
We don't know the whole story at this point, but claims from Trump supporters that the dossier is a Clinton campaign project are overstated. Steele runs a private intelligence firm in London (Orbis Business Intelligence, Ltd.) and was retained to dig up dirt on Trump by the Washington-based opposition-research firm, Fusion GPS. Fusion does a lot of work for the political Left, but it was originally hired by anti-Trump Republicans, not the Clinton campaign. Only later, when it was apparent that Trump would win the nomination, was the project handed off to Clinton backers.
By then, Steele had already done a good bit of research. In reading the dossier, one quickly notices that it does not depict Mrs. Clinton in a flattering light. It indicates that the Kremlin possesses Clinton “kompromat.” This compromising information, potentially useful for blackmail, is said to have been assembled over decades, derived mainly from eavesdropping on her conversations. If so, this would be consistent with the FBI's conclusion, in July 2016, that Clinton is reckless when it comes to communications security. The information, the dossier indicates, could be exploited to make Clinton look hypocritical and foolish. Is this true? Who knows? But we can say one thing for sure: It is not what one would expect to find in a piece of sheer Clinton propaganda.
Prior to his dossier work, Steele seems to have enjoyed a good reputation with the American intelligence and law-enforcement agents with whom he had worked. Some of his dossier information appears to come from well-placed sources; some of it is second- and third-hand, and speculative at that. On the face of things, most of Steele's sources are anonymous, another reason his claims have been given the back of the hand by Trump supporters. But from an investigator's standpoint, the sources are identifiable: If Steele cooperated with the FBI (and in some instances, even if he didn't), the Bureau could pretty easily figure out who the sources are, follow the leads, and determine whether the dossier is a complete fabrication.
The FBI plainly did not dismiss the dossier out of hand. If it used some of the dossier's information in a FISA-court surveillance application, that would only be problematic if agents failed to verify that particular information before seeking the warrant. That would be highly irregular. For now, we don't know what happened.
There are hundreds of claims in the dossier. Some of them seem outlandish — so much so that, at Forbes, Russia expert Paul Roderick Gregory debunks the dossier emphatically. Nonetheless, to my knowledge, the only claim that has been discredited with persuasive force is the assertion that Trump's long-time lawyer, Michael Cohen, had secret meetings in Prague with Russian officials. Cohen denies having ever been to Prague, and he maintains that his passport shows no visits there — a claim that wouldn't necessarily discount travel to the Czech Republic but could have been refuted easily if false. If the Bureau concluded that the dossier's claim about Cohen is wrong, one could infer that the inaccuracy is reflective of Steele's overall reporting — in which case, Trump and his associates have nothing to be concerned about.
On the other hand, it could be that some of the dossier's information is wrong but some is accurate. On that score, Business Insider's Natasha Bertrand has been carefully comparing allegations in the dossier with actual events and has found a good deal of alignment. The factual corroboration is circumstantial — no smoking-gun proof of campaign collusion between Trump associates and Putin's regime. Much of it is nonetheless disturbing — plainly in the category of suspicious activity investigators would deem worthy of investigation.
It could be that some of the dossier's information is wrong but some is accurate.
Most of the press coverage about the dossier has focused on salacious sexual allegations about Trump. These are usually dismissed by the Trump camp as completely discredited. In reality, we can say only that they are unsubstantiated. That's saliently different. For example, Steele has three sources who vouch for parts of the most lurid story; a fourth apparently cannot vouch for the story but contends that Russia has collected plenty of “embarrassing material” on Trump over the years. Of course, we want tales of depravity to be untrue, so it is tempting to reject them as false if we can rationalize doing so. Here, not only has Trump exuded confidence in his denials; the apparent falsity of the Cohen-Prague allegation invites us to say, “If Steele is wrong about that, he must be wrong about everything.”
An FBI investigator, however, would want to interview Steele and his sources, and follow up on all the leads, before coming to a conclusion.
The most important American figure in Steele's reporting is Paul Manafort. For about five months until his August 2016 ouster (i.e., the period during which Trump wrapped up the nomination, was formally nominated at the GOP convention, and began the race against Mrs. Clinton), Manafort was chairman of Trump's presidential campaign.
As we've previously noted, Mueller is clearly squeezing Manafort. The investigation seeks any information Manafort has regarding a cooperative venture between the Trump campaign and the Putin regime: Russian assistance in the campaign in exchange for Trump policy concessions on Russia. Mueller obviously sees it as his task to determine whether such a venture (a) truly did exist, (b) was spearheaded by Manafort, and (c) was known to Trump. Patently, if Mueller's investigators are talking (or at least have talked) to Steele, that turns up the heat on Manafort.
That brings us to the second reason to focus on the dossier — the one I find most disturbing. The FBI and Justice Department are thwarting Congress's efforts to get to the bottom of it.
As the Washington Examiner's Byron York has been reporting, the FBI, backed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (who appointed Mueller), has been ignoring an August 24 subpoena for information about the dossier issued by House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R., Calif.). Concurrently, DOJ and the Bureau are stonewalling Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Charles Grassley (R., Iowa), who has inquired about the dossier in a probe of suspected investigative irregularities. And then there is the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting the main congressional collusion probe. On Wednesday, Chairman Richard Burr (R., N.C.) groused that the committee had “hit a wall” because Steele refuses to discuss the dossier with its investigators.
In a nutshell, then, the Justice Department and FBI are citing the Mueller investigation as their rationale for ignoring congressional demands for information, and Steele won't talk to the Senate while he is talking to Mueller and the FBI.
In trying to wrap my brain around this, here's what I don't get: The Justice Department and the FBI now answer to President Trump, not to President Obama. The key players, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein (in place of recused Attorney General Jeff Sessions) and new FBI director Christopher Wray, are Trump appointees. So . . . if the Trump Dossier really is a completely discredited piece of garbage, who on earth has a greater incentive than Trump to expose it? Why are the Trump Justice Department and FBI impeding congressional probes? If the information is false, you would think they couldn't shovel it out fast enough.
Why are the Trump Justice Department and FBI impeding congressional probes?
But what if the information — or at least some of it — were true? Under those circumstances, the White House would make a political calculation: Trump would be better served by simply continuing to complain about a purported witch-hunt and politicized abuses of surveillance authority; there would be too much downside risk in directing the Justice Department and FBI to disclose all relevant information to Congress forthwith.
If at least some of the dossier's more important allegations had been corroborated, we would also expect the Justice Department and the FBI to refuse to cooperate with anyone other than Mueller. That would not be due to corruption — quite the opposite. It would owe to the ongoing investigation: Disclosing what the FBI has done to corroborate Steele would expose to danger (particularly of Russian retaliation) the witnesses who have provided information.
In other words, if some of the dossier had been substantiated by investigators, things would look . . . just like they look at the moment.
This is another iteration of the curiosity I've raised in connection with the related “unmasking” controversy. President Trump runs the executive branch. He is in charge of classified information. He gets to decide what may be disclosed. If he wanted us to have all the facts about Obama administration use of foreign-intelligence-collection authority to monitor the Trump campaign, disclosure would already have been made. Congress and the public would know what Trump associates had been monitored, which ones had their identities revealed in intelligence reporting, how many times, by which Obama national-security officials, and why.
Instead, the administration complains about unmasking, but never takes the steps Trump could easily take to expose it as an abuse of power.
Just like it complains about the dossier, but never takes the steps Trump could easily take to expose it as a fraud.
None of this would prove collusion between Trump's campaign and the Kremlin. It does suggest, however, that there were good reasons to conduct an investigation.

A Spice Girls reunion is in the cards after the Girl Power stars confirmed they are working together once more.
The British band had a string of hits in the mid-1990s and early 2000s. Amid new movements for female equality and empowerment, the band said: “The time now feels right to explore some incredible new opportunities together.”
In a statement they added: “We all agree that there are many exciting possibilities that will once again embrace the original essence of The Spice Girls, while reinforcing our message of female empowerment for future generations.”
Several of the band's lineup of Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice), Geri Horner (Ginger Spice), Emma Bunton (Baby Spice), Melanie Brown (Scary Spice) and Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice) teased the news they were working together again with pictures and messages on social media.
“Lovely seeing the girls #girlpower is alive and well,” Horner (née Halliwell) said. “Love my girls!!!” said Beckham. Brown tweeted: “These amazing women have helped me become who I am.”
The group met at Horner's house in Hertfordshire, England, alongside former manager and pop impresario Simon Fuller, the BBC reported. They have reunited before, for the greatest hits tour and a performance at the 2012 London Olympics.
Chisholm told BBC radio Saturday that nothing is “set in stone” but that it was great to see the positive reaction to the news the band had gotten together.
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela condemned on Friday U.S. comments that its own military could topple President Nicolas Maduro and said a Latin American tour by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was seeking a regional “intervention” against the socialist government.
Accusing Washington of seeking to undermine democracy in Latin America and return to the days of “imperialism,” Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino lashed out at Tillerson during a broadcast on state television.
“Every day he distances himself more from diplomacy to enter into war-mongering. You have no moral authority,” said Padrino, flanked by armed forces' top brass who swore loyalty to Maduro.
“This man... will try to persuade Latin America governments to intervene in Venezuela. That's a publicity stunt,” he added, blaming U.S. President Donald Trump's sanctions for economic hardship in Venezuela.
On Thursday, Tillerson raised the prospect of a Venezuelan military coup ahead of a five-day tour of Latin America.
Discussing Venezuela, the U.S. official said militaries in Latin America often “handled” transitions from bad governments, but insisted he was not advocating “regime change.”
“If the kitchen gets a little too hot for him, I am sure that he's got some friends over in Cuba that could give him a nice hacienda on the beach and he could have a nice life over there,” Tillerson said, referring to 55-year-old Maduro, who has a close relationship with Cuba's communist government.

Many opposition leaders would love for Maduro to seek exile abroad. The former bus driver and union leader is widely disliked in Venezuela due to a brutal economic crisis that has sparked malnutrition, disease and mass emigration.
But even some anti-government activists fear Washington's heavy-handed approach will only foster unity between the Socialist Party and the armed forces, as they would be loathe to seem to be taking orders from Washington.
The U.S. comments will likely also cause unease in capitals of Latin America, where memories are rife of U.S. backing for right-wing dictators during the Cold War. That could hamper Tillerson's ability to reach a consensus on Venezuela during his trip.

Senior military leaders have consistently stood by Maduro, whom critics accuse of turning Venezuela into a dictatorship and wrecking its economy. But discontent among the rank-and-file, especially at their own economic penuries, is evident.
There have been some small uprisings against Maduro from within the security forces. A National Guard captain led an attack on a barracks but was later arrested, and a police helicopter pilot lobbed grenades at government buildings but was tracked down and killed last month.
Venezuela's opposition leaders have long urged the military to take action to force Maduro to follow the constitution. He maintains the United States and opposition parties are part of an international right-wing conspiracy to oust him and get their hands on the OPEC nation's oil wealth.
Trump has himself suggested possible military intervention in Venezuela, though that was widely rejected in Latin America. Trump has imposed individual and economic sanctions on Venezuela's government, accusing it of rights abuses and corruption.
Venezuelan officials say Tillerson is particularly bitter towards them because he was chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp when late leader Hugo Chavez nationalized one of its oil projects in the South American nation a decade ago.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - K.T. McFarland, picked by President Donald Trump to be the U.S. ambassador to Singapore, withdrew from consideration for the job on Friday after her nomination became stalled in the U.S. Senate.
McFarland was on Trump's presidential transition team and later appointed deputy national security adviser under Michael Flynn.
Trump nominated McFarland last May to be the U.S. envoy to Singapore. When the U.S. Senate did not act on the nomination by the end of 2017 the White House resubmitted her nomination in early January.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee said in December that McFarland's nomination had been delayed due to concerns about her testimony to Congress over communications with Russia.
McFarland had said in a written response to a question from Democratic Senator Cory Booker, a foreign relations committee member, that she was “not aware” of communications between Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn and Sergei Kislyak, when Kislyak was ambassador to Russia.
However, the New York Times reported early in December that it had obtained an email McFarland sent on Dec. 29, 2016, the day former President Barack Obama's administration authorized new sanctions against Russia, saying Flynn would talk to Kislyak that evening.
Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his contacts with Russia, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors delving into the actions of Trump's inner circle before he took office.
On Friday, McFarland, a former Fox News national security analyst, said in a letter to Trump, “I am asking that you withdraw my nomination to be the U.S. Ambassador to Singapore.”
“I have come to this decision reluctantly, because I believe in your mission,” she wrote. A copy of the letter was seen by Reuters.
Trump said in a statement, “K.T. served my administration with distinction. Unfortunately, some Democrats chose to play politics rather than move forward with a qualified nominee for a critically important post,” he said.
McFarland wrote that she believed Trump had “laid the foundations for a new foreign policy that puts America's interests ahead of, but not at the expense of, our obligations to others.”
“Know that I have no intention of withdrawing from the national debate and I want to help you in whatever way I can.”
A lot of things have been said about Edmonton Oilers prospect Jesse Puljujarvi. The hot topic on Edmonton's prized forward centers around his development, or lack thereof. At the 2016 NHL Draft, the first two names predictably flew off the board. Auston Matthews went first overall to the Toronto Maple Leafs, followed by Patrik Laine going to the Winnipeg Jets. Puljujarvi was the consensus pick to go third.
Many people believed Puljujarvi and the Columbus Blue Jackets were a perfect match. After all, why wouldn't the Blue Jackets general manager Jarmo Kekalainen select his fellow countryman from Finland? Kekalainen instead caused a shockwave when he chose a big, strong, potential first-line center in Pierre-Luc Dubois. The hockey world was stunned, as was Oilers GM Peter Chiarelli who ran to the podium to select the Finnish forward.
The rumors leading up to the draft were that Edmonton was going to select a defenseman with the fourth selection. Olli Juolevi, Mikhail Sergachev, and Jakob Chychrun were the three big blueliners that year. Instead, Puljujarvi fell into Edmonton's lap, or did he?
Debunking the Kekalainen Story
Thus started a rumor that the Blue Jackets GM knew something about Puljujarvi that soured his taste. After all, Kekalainen's from Finland, and he's bound to have some connections in his native country, right? The words were spreading that Puljujarvi didn't compete the way Laine and Matthews did. Then it was that Puljujarvi's 200-foot game wasn't as rosy as most scouts thought it was. Whatever the reason, the seed was planted that there was something wrong with Puljujarvi.
“I was shocked by Puljujarvi. I just could not see him going anywhere but three. I know there had been talk floated out there of Winnipeg even going with him at two. And Dubois, I know people that had him six, seven on the list. In the Top 10, I know that was pretty unanimous. – Gare Joyce, Sports Writer (Sportsnet)
There was a lot of shock and awe when the Blue Jackets took Dubois. Even the Columbus media was perplexed over the decision. One theory was that Kekalainen really wanted Dubois, but may have botched a deal with Edmonton or Calgary. Those were the two teams picking after Columbus. The Blue Jackets would've moved down in a trade, and with a handshake agreement the other side wouldn't take Dubois.
Jarmo Kekalainen said he would take the best player available, regardless of position. Then, he turned his back on the best player available and everyone at First Niagara Center knew it. – Michael Arace, Columbus Dispatch
Regardless it's a lot of conspiracy theories without a whole lot of substance to sink your teeth into. It's quite simple though. Kekalainen really wanted that big first-line center, not a winger like Puljujarvi.
This whole talk might've just been a whole lot of hoopla. Then again it does make a good story, doesn't it?
Patience Is a Virtue with NHL Prospects
Last season, Puljujarvi made the opening night roster in Edmonton. He even scored in his NHL debut. Things were looking up! The 18-year-old would then struggle through the next 13 games with just two assists. This prompted fans to ask if the Oilers should send him to the minors. It was evident Puljujarvi wasn't quite ready for the NHL just yet.
He was playing third or fourth-line minutes most nights, something that wasn't conducive to his success. Ask yourself this; if an 18-year-old is playing 7:21 minutes in ice time (TOI) on some nights, do you think you're going to get results? Adding to that, Puljujarvi was a healthy scratch 14 times by the Oilers. He played 28 of 42 games until he was re-assigned to the Condors on January 5.
Under the tutelage of Bakersfield Condors head coach Gerry Fleming, Puljujarvi got his development back on track. He was playing top minutes in Bakersfield and finished the year with 28 points in 39 games. If you're familiar with the NHLE calculator, that's the equivalent of 27.7 points. Those are fair numbers for a rookie, but not difference-making numbers, yet. This season, Puljujarvi is a tweener for a lot of people.
Should Edmonton send him back to the AHL for another year? Should he get a look in Edmonton's crowded top nine? When all was said and done, Kailer Yamamoto burst onto the scene and exceeded expectations. Puljujarvi had a decent camp, but it was a numbers game, and Yamamoto and some others outplayed him. Some people have been quick to write off Puljujarvi, but going back to Bakersfield again doesn't mean he's floundering as a prospect, far from it.
Leave Puljujarvi Alone, Let Him Develop
Some of the more asinine comments online were that Puljujarvi was already being labeled as a bust by some fans. Laughable! Leon Draisaitl faced similar adversity during his rise to NHL stardom. Draisaitl struggled like Puljujarvi in his rookie year. He then didn't make the Oilers opening night roster in 2015-16 before emerging as a star and playing the final 72 games that season.
Patience is often a virtue when it comes to NHL prospects, even first round picks. It's clear the Oilers don't have to rush prospects along anymore, and that's a good thing. Edmonton doesn't need Puljujarvi to jump in and save them, and Puljujarvi doesn't need to be with the main club right now. The objective is for this youngster to develop. The only way to develop is to play. If he's not going to play, he's not going to develop.
Olli Juolevi is another top-five pick from that 2016 draft that didn't make his NHL team this year either. Juolevi was loaned to TPS in Finland by the Vancouver Canucks. Even Dylan Strome (third overall, 2015) has shown a fair share of struggles at the NHL level. Strome is now penciled into the Arizona Coyotes' roster.
“Jesse needs more time. We expect Jesse, when he arrives and he's ready to play – and the same can be said of Yamamoto – to play in our top nine, minimum. Not on the fourth line. We didn't feel like he won that position and therefore we wanted to get him to Bakersfield and have him start the season there and get him working on his game.” – Oilers Head Coach Todd McLellan
NHL Prospects Mature at Different Rates
The point is, prospects mature at different speeds, and people need to ease off Puljujarvi. He needs to develop into a difference-maker for the Oilers, not just another body on the roster. He needs to mature, work on his offensive game, and build some consistency. Coming into the NHL, there's a different level of desperation and urgency with players. Puljujarvi just doesn't have that gear, yet.
I thought he was playing straighter lines, pursuing the puck better, and making more plays. But he wasn't without mistakes. I told him he needed to clean up his game a little bit, go down there and shove it up my you know what. I wouldn't be adverse to bringing him back, but I want to see his game cleaned up a little bit. I'm happy with the development trail he's on. – Oilers GM Peter Chiarelli
If Puljujarvi can play top line minutes and get some power play time, he'll come back to Edmonton a better player. There's already a precedent that's been set. Mikko Rantanen, William Nylander, Logan Couture and Bobby Ryan all went through this before becoming difference-makers at the NHL level.
Leave Puljujarvi down in the AHL as long as it takes so he becomes that type of player for Edmonton.

VANDALIA — The Vandalia-Butler Chamber of Commerce held its annual membership meeting on Tuesday morning.
During the meeting, the City of Vandalia, Butler Township, and the Vandalia-Butler City Schools gave their annual “State of” speeches.
Prior to the presentations, chamber members were honored for reaching 20 years of membership. Those recognized included Fastsigns, Hunter Consulting Company, Lion Apparel, Living Word Church, National Auto Lube, Outback Steakhouse, Smith, Denlinger & Company, and THT Press.
Also, the chamber announced nominees for its board of directors. Ballots will be mailed by March 26 and members have until Monday, April 9 to cast their ballot.
Nominees are (* denotes incumbent):
Betty Dankworth, Koorsen Fire & Security
Darrell Wacker, Vandalia Drummer News
David Bucher, Sutton/Dalco Auto Leasing
Erin Barlow*, Xcel Sports Medicine
Paula Gibbs-Licher, Jan's Flower & Gift Shop
Tim Stammen*, Keller Williams Hometown Realty
Zachary Bruening, Edward Jones Investment
Vandalia-Butler City Schools Superintendent Rob O'Leary and Treasurer Eric Beavers were the first to present. O'Leary noted that the implementation of the strategic plan developed by the community in 2016 was well underway with 34 out of 43 strategic actions already underway at the beginning of the 2017-18 school year.
Beavers also gave a brief financial report while thanking those in attendance for the community passing a renewal levy last fall.
The City of Vandalia unveiled a video presentation narrated by Communications Manager Rich Hopkins.
He noted that due to the challenge of keeping enough part-time staff in the Division of Fire, the city is in the process of hiring three new full-time paramedic/firefighters.
“This should allow for a stronger and more stable workforce,” he said.
The Division of Fire has also placed a new rescue engine in service at a cost of nearly $500,000 as well as a new medic unit.
Hopkins said that the Division of Police received over 14,000 calls for service in 2017. The city is implementing a NextGen 911 system that will allow police to receive text messages and also use cellular data to better pinpoint the location of a call.
“The Division of Police will be rolling out an informational campaign later this year to let everyone know when the system is fully operational,” said Hopkins.
The Division of Police also began wearing body-worn cameras in 2017 and also received additional training on how best to interact with people suffering of signs of mental illness.
“It's foresight and training like this that has allowed the Division of Police to receive CALEA (Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement) accreditation now for 25 years and running,” Hopkins said.
Parks and Recreation saw tremendous growth in the number of people playing Pickleball last year in part due to the new courts at Helke Park. Hopkins also noted the partnership between the city and school district to refurbish the other six tennis courts at Helke Park.
He also announced that the city will hold a ceremony on April 19 to rename the Vandalia Recreation Center after former Police Chief and City Manager Bruce Sucher. Sucher died suddenly a year ago and was instrumental in the development and construction of the Rec Center.
“He was a good friend, and he had big dreams for this City,” said Hopkins. “One of his crowning achievements as a City Manager was the opening of the Vandalia Recreation Center, or as we will be calling it later this year, The Bruce Sucher Recreation Center.
Hopkins also touted the city's success in economic development. He cited the development at the former Morton Middle School named 40 West, MSW Plastics establishing its first American facility on Ventnor Avenue which will bring 35 jobs, and Ortronics, a cabling company that will bring 125 jobs to the city.
Butler Township Trustee Mike Lang reported that over 80% of township residents have chosen to participate in the electrical aggregation program approved by voters in 2016.
“This has provided a real savings for our residents,” said Lang.
He noted that the township has more than 250 businesses, a third of which are concentrated in the York Commons/Miller Lane Business District. More than 25% of the township's annual revenue comes from Tax Increment Financing, JEDZ income tax, and the hotel and lodging tax.
New businesses are under development. They include Airport Deluxe RV Storage, Concentra Occupational Health, Home 2 Suites, King's World Academy, and Red Lion Inn & Suites.
The township added a part-time Code Enforcement Officer, Eddie Robinson, in 2017. Jeff Barnett was also hired as the Service Director after the retirement of Supervisor Doug Brunk.
Lang also reported that the Willowbrook Subdivision Upgrades, a $500,000 project, was completed in 2017. The project included sidewalk, curb, and accessible ramp repairs as well as new pavement on eight streets. The township receiveda $50,000 Community Development Block Grant toward the project.
Butler Townshi's Fire Department also added three new full-time firefighters/paramedics. The department responded to 3,232 emergency calls in 2017, a 7% increase over 2016.
The Police Department saw an even greater increase in calls for service with 17,737. That is a 27% increase over 2016 and an average of 50 per day.
The department was able to fill five open positions thanks to the police levy passed in 2016. That leaves the department fully staffed with 18 members.
Lang also reported that, due to the success of the township's bicentennial festival in 2017, the festival will become an annual festival. The details, including dates, will be announced soon.

As the FCC vote to undo net neutrality requirements looms, some of technology's greatest minds have come together to issue a plea to congressional leadership to save the internet as we know it.
Even though millions of letters from the general public were ignored, in a last ditch effort to preserve net neutrality, 21 high profile technologists have penned an open letter to the FCC.
Addressed to Marsha Senators Roger Wicker and Brian Shatz, along with members of Congress Marsha Blackburn and Michael Doyle, the letter carries the blunt title, “Internet Pioneers and Leaders Tell the FCC: You Don't Understand How the Internet Works.”Overturn Net Neutrality? The internet's founders have a word on that…
Among the signees are Tim Berners-Lee, Vint Cerf and Steve Wozniak, along with fellow tech pioneers and top names from Mozilla, Betaworks, Internet Archive and Tufts. The letters ask that the politicians call on Ajit Pai to cancel the planned December 14 “Restoring Internet Freedom Order” vote that looks to overturn Obama-era regulation that established net neutrality rules.
The note calls out the FCC for failing to hold open meetings and seemingly ignoring the millions of comments submitted by the public. The signees also point to a 43-page comment submitted to the commission over the summer on behalf of many of the same names.
“The proposed Order would also repeal oversight over other unreasonable discrimination and unreasonable practices, and over interconnection with last-mile Internet access providers,” the letter reads. “The proposed Order removes long-standing FCC oversight over Internet access providers without an adequate replacement to protect consumers, free markets and online innovation.”
Here's the full text of the letter:
Senator Wicker:
Senator Schatz:
Representative Blackburn:
Representative Doyle: We are the pioneers and technologists who created and now operate the Internet, and some of the innovators and business people who, like many others, depend on it for our livelihood. We are writing to respectfully urge you to call on FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to cancel the December 14 vote on the FCC's proposed Restoring Internet Freedom Order (WC Docket No. 17-108 ). This proposed Order would repeal key network neutrality protections that prevent Internet access providers from blocking content, websites and applications, slowing or speeding up services or classes of service, and charging online services for access or fast lanes to Internet access providers' customers. The proposed Order would also repeal oversight over other unreasonable discrimination and unreasonable practices, and over interconnection with last-mile Internet access providers. The proposed Order removes long-standing FCC oversight over Internet access providers without an adequate replacement to protect consumers, free markets and online innovation. It is important to understand that the FCC's proposed Order is based on a flawed and factually inaccurate understanding of Internet technology. These flaws and inaccuracies were documented in detail in a 43-page-long joint comment signed by over 200 of the most prominent Internet pioneers and engineers and submitted to the FCC on July 17, 2017. Despite this comment, the FCC did not correct its misunderstandings, but instead premised the proposed Order on the very technical flaws the comment explained. The technically-incorrect proposed Order dismantles 15 years of targeted oversight from both Republican and Democratic FCC chairs, who understood the threats that Internet access providers could pose to open markets on the Internet. The experts' comment was not the only one the FCC ignored. Over 23 million comments have been submitted by a public that is clearly passionate about protecting the Internet. The FCC could not possibly have considered these adequately. Indeed, breaking with established practice, the FCC has not held a single open public meeting to hear from citizens and experts about the proposed Order. Furthermore, the FCC's online comment system has been plagued by major problems that the FCC has not had time to investigate. These include bot-generated comments that impersonated Americans, including dead people, and an unexplained outage of the FCC's on-line comment system that occurred at the very moment TV host John Oliver was encouraging Americans to submit comments to the system. Compounding our concern, the FCC has failed to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests about these incidents and failed to provide information to a New York State Attorney General's investigation of them. We therefore call on you to urge FCC Chairman Pai to cancel the FCC's vote. The FCC's rushed and technically incorrect proposed Order to abolish net neutrality protections without any replacement is an imminent threat to the Internet we worked so hard to create. It should be stopped. Signed, Frederick J. Baker, IETF Chair 1996-2001, ISOC Board Chair 2002-2006 Mitchell Baker, Executive Chairwoman, Mozilla Foundation Steven M.

State officials have made no change in the official estimate of state tax revenue during the current budgeting year.
The governor and legislators will still have to cut at least $35 million from the current state budget soon, based on a previous tax revenue estimate set in October.
A three-member panel met this afternoon to discuss the state's economy and set their official prediction of future state tax collections. Retired businessman David Underwood of Mason City said the farm sector is worrisome.
“Somehow or other our farmers enough reserves built up when prices were good that they were able to survive a couple of years of down commodity prices and fluctuations in cattle prices and hog prices,” Underwood said, “but just recently I've heard some of the bankers talking about farmers really in trouble now.”
Dave Roederer, the governor's budget director, said agland values seem to have “stabilized” and he predicted the manufacturing sector is poised for growth.
“Manufacturing is starting to hire, both large and small (factories),” Roederer said. “…Manufacturing represents on a wage basis about 22-25 percent of the wage income that comes into the state, so that is one of the reasons I think that we are a little more positive.”
Legislative Services Agency diretor Holly Lyons sees little change in the U.S. economy this fall.
“Iowa revenues, while still growing, are disappointing for the first five months of the fiscal year,” Lyons said. “There is nothing, however, to indicate that the growth will turn negative, but growth is very slow.”
Lyons, Roederer and Underwood are members of the panel that estimates state tax collections. The group has come under fire for missing recent predictions, forcing legislators to vote to cut the budget and the governor to dip into the state's reserves to ensure the last state budget didn't dip into a deficit.
The governor's budget director characterized the panel's predictions this way today: “From my perspective, we're very firmly on the side of we're not sure what's going to happen.”
Lyons offered a similar sentiment.
“Forecasting state revenues 18 months or more in the future is always risky and one this is certain: we know that we will be wrong,” Lyons said. “We will either be too high or too low.”
The panel is predicting tax collections will grow by four percent in the next state fiscal year. That's $9.3 million less than the group's October forecast.
AUDIO of Revenue Estimating Conference meeting, 27:00
Roederer told reporters after the meeting some or nearly all of the $98 million ending balance could be used to cover some of the expected shortfall in the current year's state budget.
KIEV (Reuters) - The author of an article that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller believes Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort ghost-wrote in violation of a gag order said on Saturday he had sought input on the op-ed before publishing to avoid errors.

On Friday, Mueller unveiled evidence against Manafort to convince a judge that he wrote the article to improve his public image. Manafort is facing charges as part of an investigation into accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.
The op-ed was published on Thursday in the English-language Kyiv Post under the byline of Oleg Voloshyn, a former spokesman for Ukraine's foreign affairs ministry.
In a telephone call with Reuters, Voloshyn said he wrote the article, but before publishing had shown it to Konstantin Kilimnik, a Ukrainian whom Mueller alluded to in a filing earlier this week as having ties to Russian intelligence.
Voloshyn said he had decided to write the article to correct misrepresentations of Manafort in the media without prejudicing the U.S. trial and had consulted Kilimnik, who is close to Manafort, to make sure the text was accurate.
“I didn't want to write any stupid things in it that would worsen his (Manafort‘s) already difficult position,” Voloshyn said. “I sent the text to Kilimnik and it was Kilimnik's idea to send it to Paul (Manafort) for a look.”
“He (Kilimnik) sent it back to me with some comments and suggestions. Whether these were his comments and suggestions or Paul's suggestions is not a question I can answer,” he said.
Voloshyn said allegations of Kilimnik's ties to Russia were groundless and that Kilimnik, whom Reuters has not been able to reach, did not want to talk to news media.
Voloshyn said he was prepared to testify that he had no direct contact with Manafort in the run-up to the publication of the article, which praised Manafort's work promoting European Union-Ukraine relations and said he lobbied for pro-Western values, not Russian interests.
“In September or in the summer, when he started having problems, I sent him a letter of support. He did not respond,” Voloshyn said.
On Monday, Mueller's team had said in a court filing that they had been assured by Manafort's counsel that they had taken steps to prevent the article from being published.
Voloshyn told Reuters that he was not contacted by Manafort's lawyers in an attempt to stop him from publishing it.
“Who could forbid me?” he said. “What right does Mueller have to forbid me to do something?”
Manafort's attorney has acknowledged that his client helped edit Voloshyn's article but denies he violated the gag order, saying an article published in a Ukrainian newspaper would not substantially prejudice the case in the United States.
The charges against Manafort include conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's government, who was ousted in 2014.
All parties were ordered by the judge on Nov. 8 not to discuss the case in public or with the media in a way that could substantially prejudice a fair trial.
Earlier this week, Mueller's team discovered the draft op-ed was in the works and ordered Manafort's lawyers to shut it down.
Yusuf Pathan's Hong Kong T20 Blitz stint scrapped
Pathan was set to play in the competition next month.
@shanky11173 by Shankar Narayan News 15 Feb 2017, 11:46 IST
Pathan was set to play for the Kowloon Cantons
What's the story?
In what could be a big blow both for the player and the team, Indian cricketer Yusuf Pathan's stint at the Hong Kong T20 blitz next month has been scrapped by the BCCI. The 31-year-old was set to play for the Kowloon Cantons in the competition, but the board have now taken a U-turn, by returning to their previous stand of not giving a No-Objection Certificate(NOC) for players to compete in overseas Leagues.
According to a few BCCI sources, one of the reasons why his stint could not go through was because a few other players also put forth a request of playing in competitions abroad and when such a scenario began to build-up, then the board decided to decline Pathan the opportunity to go and play. Sources also added that Pathan had initially got his NOC to play in the League.
On a condition of anonymity, a BCCI official gave his reasoning on why the board was reluctant to let Indian players participate in overseas competitions.
“Indian players have a brand name. Indian players playing in league will attract Indian viewers. It would also mean that our sponsors too want to invest in other leagues. That is why we will be not allowing any Indian players to be part of any leagues,” the official said.
Other prominent stars like Darren Sammy, Kumar Sangakkara, Michael Clarke etc are also likely to be a part of the competition in Hong Kong.

In case you didn't know
Pathan no longer holds a BCCI contract and was not included in the West Zone squad for the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in Mumbai. He last played for India in 2012 and perhaps sensed an opportunity to get back into the reckoning by putting in a good show in the competition could get him back in the fray.
Pathan represents the Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League and has been part of two IPL winning campaigns for them, in 2012 and 2014. Along with the likes of Shakib Al Hasan, Pathan has played a key role for the franchise in the middle order.
Here's a video of the fastest IPL fifty struck by Pathan against the Sunrisers Hyderabad during the 2014 season:
Sportskeeda's take
Purely from a cricketing perspective, it becomes imperative that the BCCI lets Indian players play in foreign leagues as it would help them get the exposure to overseas conditions. It could have helped a player like Pathan had he been allowed to take part in the League as he could have had the opportunity to put in a good effort and further brighten his chances of making a comeback.
On the other hand, for a player like MS Dhoni, who only plays limited-overs cricket for India, the need to be in touch with the game is vital and that will happen only if he is allowed to play in other competitions around the world.
The trial of a Toronto police officer charged for refusing to help stop a young man from taking his own life has been quashed, after an Ontario Superior Court judge found his failure to act did not amount to criminal breach of trust. The decision reverses a lower court's ruling last year that found there was enough evidence that a jury could believe Const. Kyle Upjohn breached the public trust and avoided his duty to preserve a life — indeed, “drove the other way” — and that a trial should proceed. Upjohn was sitting in his marked police vehicle on the afternoon of Feb. 2, 2016 when approached by a concerned citizen alerting him to a young man attempting to hang himself in the park. Instead of helping, Upjohn falsely claimed he was on another call, told the man to dial 911, then drove away, according to a Jan. 25 decision by Justice Maureen Forestell. Soon after, 19-year-old Alexandre Boucher was found dead.
Article Continued Below
Ontario's police watchdog, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), charged Upjohn with criminal negligence causing death and failing to provide the necessities of life, but the charges were later withdrawn by the Crown. The officer was instead charged with breach of trust in connection to Boucher's death — a charge laid when an official is accused of breaching the standard of responsibility and conduct demanded by his office. After a preliminary inquiry last year, Justice Sheila Ray ruled Upjohn should go to trial on the charge, finding there was enough evidence on which a jury could find that the officer took steps “to avoid performing his duty of preserving life and he drove the other way.”
President Trump told Fox News that he may soon issue a pardon for Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff who was found guilty two weeks ago of criminal contempt for defying a state judge's order to stop traffic patrols targeting suspected undocumented immigrants.
Said Trump: “I am seriously considering a pardon for Sheriff Arpaio. He has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration. He's a great American patriot and I hate to see what has happened to him.”
Trump said the pardon “could happen in the next few days.”

Marcus Hutchins, the WannaCry kill-switch hero, has today pleaded not guilty to charges of creating and selling malware at a hearing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
The court took the unusual step of relaxing the the 23-year-old's bail terms, allowing him to access the internet and work again. He will also be able to live in Los Angeles, where his employer is based. Hutchins is, however, obliged to surrender his passport and will be required to wear a tracking device until his trial, which has been scheduled for October.
"Marcus Hutchins is a brilliant young man and a hero," said Marcia Hofmann, founder of Zeigeist Law, outside the court house. "He is going to vigorously defend himself against these charges and when the evidence comes to light we are confident that he will be fully vindicated."
The change in bail conditions is interesting. Usually computer crime suspects are instructed to stay offline completely, but the only restrictions on Hutchins is that he can't visit the Wannacry server domain.
Hutchins became the toast of the infosec world when his actions helped limit the spread of the WannaCry ransomware, which affected NHS hospitals and numerous other organisations worldwide in May.
Hutchins attended the Black Hat and DEF CON conferences in Las Vegas earlier this month only to be arrested before boarding his flight back home to the UK.
US authorities allege he created Kronos, a banking trojan. Hutchins' lawyers previously indicated he intended to deny charges during an earlier bail hearing.
"We are very pleased today that the court modified his terms to allow him to return to his important work," said his lawyer Brian Klein, partner at Baker Marquart LLP.
Hutchins faces six charges related to the development and distribution of Kronos. A second, unnamed defendant features on the same rap sheet. ®

10 Indian cricketers who faded away after good starts
A look at the faded stars of Indian cricket.
Praveen Kumar has gradually declined as a bowler over the years
Cricket is one of the most-played sports in the world and has become a part of millions of people's lives. It has seen many great cricketers and some not as great.
While many players have risen to fame through their consistency, there are some who could not maintain the consistency in their performances.
Here we will look at those faded stars who have been forgotten now.
#10 Rishi Dhawan
Rishi Dhawan
Rishi Dhawan, the all-rounder from the mountainous regions of Himachal Pradesh was once considered as India's solution for a long-term all-rounder. However, after having two unimpressive seasons in the IPL, he has been overlooked by the cricket fraternity.
In the three ODIs and the single T20 game he played for India, he only scored 13 runs and took only two wickets at a very expensive economy rate of 8.50. He last played for India in 2016 against Australia.
Dhawan will have to revamp his fitness and also prove his worth in domestic tournaments in order to get a look-in by IPL franchises and also the selection committee in order to retrieve his lost fame.
Due to Dhawan's experience at the top level, he is the captain of his state Himachal Pradesh.

Diane Kruger, whose new film “In the Fade” comes out Dec. 27, talked about her worst-ever auditioning experience during an interview with rising “Downsizing” actress Hong Chau for Variety‘s “Actors on Actors” series.
“Do you have to audition very much anymore?” Chau asked Kruger. “I feel like you don't.”
“Sometimes, for things that I really want or that somebody doesn't see me in, you want to audition. But I remember so many terrible stories about auditioning,” Kruger responded. She went on to recall a story about a director “who shall go unnamed” that she once auditioned for. She said she had to learn around 15 pages of dialogue for a film.
“It was a really long monologue with difficult lines,” Kruger continued. “The audition was in this hotel and there are like 10 people in the room. I start the monologue and his cell phone starts ringing in the middle of it. It rings twice or three times and picks it up. He doesn't say, ‘Oh, I'm sorry.' He just looks at it and goes, ‘Start again.'”
After she started from the beginning, the phone rang again — he hadn't turned it off. According to Kruger, he picked it up, gestured at the actress to hold, and answered the call. “He literally was making dinner plans. Then he said, ‘Okay, go ahead. Sorry. Start again.' I did. And the phone rang again,” she said. “I didn't even let him answer it. I just got my stuff and left. That's so disrespectful, right? Screw him. That was my worst auditioning experience.”
Season 7 of Variety's “Actors on Actors,” presented by Google Home, will air from Jan. 2-4 at 7 p.m. on PBS SoCal KOCE.
YEREVAN (Sputnik) - Talks between opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan and acting prime minister of Armenia Karen Karapetyan have been canceled, press secretary of the opposition Civil Contract party Tigran Avinyan told Sputnik on Tuesday.
"Negotiations between Nikol Pashinyan and acting prime minister Karen Karapetyan have been canceled," Avinyan said, adding that it was unclear when they could take place.

Avinyan earlier said that the opposition insisted that the talks could only be held on those points that had been announced in advance, namely, the peaceful transfer of power and early parliamentary elections, and that the ruling Republican Party cannot play the key role in the interim government.
"The Republicans reject this approach," Avinyan stressed.

Oroville >> Mandatory evacuations have been lifted for residents of Oroville, Gridley and other areas downstream of Oroville Dam.
At a 1:45 p.m. news conference in Oroville, officials said the threat of a concrete wall collapsing at the head of the emergency spillway has been minimized and residents can return home. It's now just an evacuation warning rather than a mandatory evacuation. Residents should still be prepared to leave if conditions worsen, the Butte County Sheriff's Office said.
More than 180,000 people in Oroville, Gridley and other cities along the Feather River corridor in Butte, Yuba and Sutter counties were told to quickly evacuate at 4 p.m. Sunday because dam operators feared the structure could collapse.
Tractors and trucks full of huge boulders were working at the dam this morning, trying to plug a hole that developed in the emergency spillway below the concrete wall when the lake overflowed into it Saturday.
As of noon, dam operators were releasing 100,000 cubic-feet per second of water down the broken regular spillway, which started coming apart on Feb. 7. They are trying to lower the lake in anticipation of incoming storms, which are supposed to arrive late Wednesday. The lake has dropped 14 feet since it reached its peak when it started overflowing Saturday.
On Sunday afternoon, as water flowed out of the lake and down a ravine that serves as the never-used emergency spillway, the erosion started working its way up toward a 20-foot wall that is the lip of the emergency spillway north of the dam. If that wall had collapsed, a quarter-million acre-feet of water could have been dumped over the hillside and into the river below. The fear of such a failure prompted the evacuation order.
Effects of the evacuation are widespread. Schools are closed for the rest of the week in all Butte County districts except Paradise and Chico. County offices in Oroville are closed. Butte College classes are canceled in Oroville and Chico.
Hundreds of people were staying at official evacuation centers, like the Silver Dollar and Glenn County fairgrounds, and at places like churches, Elks lodges, a martial arts center and others that opened their doors to evacuees.
About an hour before the announcement, Caltrans announced that Highways 99, 70, 162 and 20 — roads leading to the evacuated areas — were opening again after being closed since Sunday.
From Chico, the only route to Sacramento had been to take Highway 32 from Chico west to Orland, and then south on Interstate 5.
LOS ANGELES (AP)  Southern California won its final nine games last season after losing at Utah in quarterback Sam Darnold's first start.
The No. 14 Trojans will aim for another streak after falling at No. 11 Washington State. They play lowly Oregon State on Saturday. Coach Clay Helton has spent the last week emphasizing that every goal USC wants to accomplish can still be achieved.
"For us as a team, we're in a great situation right now. You are always trying to improve year in, year out, and I remember this time last year we're sitting at 2-3," Helton said.
But to meet those expectations, injury-riddled USC (4-1, 2-1 Pac-12) will need to get healthy. Right guard Viane Talamaivao is out for the season with a torn pectoral muscle that requires surgery, and his likely replacement, freshman Andrew Vorhees, was held out of practice Thursday with a tight back. However, he's still expected to play.

Right tackle Chuma Edoga is doubtful with a high-ankle sprain. The list of bumps and bruises seems to get longer every week.
Helton couldn't help but ruefully laugh when recounting how linebacker Jordan Iosefa and wide receiver Jalen Greene were injured when they accidentally collided during pregame warmups against the Cougars.
"I've never seen it in 23 years," Helton said. "It was a bad deal. We've had some bad luck lately. That's about as much as I can take as far as injuries go."
USC will handle those injuries without a bye week during the regular season. The struggling Beavers (1-4, 0-2) might be the closest thing to a win because of their own injury woes. Running back Ryan Nall is a game-time decision after spraining his ankle in a loss to Washington last week, and quarterback Jake Luton remains out indefinitely with a thoracic spine fracture.
Redshirt junior Darrell Garretson will start for Oregon State. In nine games since transferring from Utah State, Garretson has completed 50.6 percent of his passes for 711 yards, four touchdowns and four interceptions.
Oregon State has been outscored 200-71 in its four games against FBS teams. However, USC said it is not overlooking a team that will be desperate for an upset.
"USC is a lot of people's Super Bowl, especially a team like Oregon State, so we just got to stick to what we do," USC safety Chris Hawkins said.
Here are some things to watch as the Trojans and Beavers meet for the first time since 2014:
DARNOLD'S DOLDRUMS: Darnold threw for 164 yards against Washington State, his lowest total as a starter. Some of that can be attributed to an offensive line playing most of the game without three starters and facing a strong Washington State pass rush. Plus there's been turnover at wide receiver. Darnold will have reinforcements in both areas as left tackle Toa Lobendahn and wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. will return to the lineup this week. Lobendahn didn't play at Washington State due to a skin infection that required intravenous antibiotics. Mitchell has missed the last two games with a groin injury.
LA COLISEUM: Oregon State hasn't beaten USC in Los Angeles since 1960 and has lost 23 straight games at the Coliseum. Only five of those games have been decided by one possession, while USC has been ranked in the Top 25 in all but six of those meetings.
TYNER TIME: With Nall's status in doubt, senior running back Thomas Tyner could be in line for his most significant workload since playing for in-state rival Oregon against Ohio State in the 2015 national championship game. Tyner medically retired from the Ducks after shoulder surgery sidelined him for the 2015 season before transferring to Oregon State in May. A former five-star recruit, Tyner has rushed for 72 yards and one touchdown on 15 carries in three games this season. During two seasons at Oregon, Tyner rushed for 1,284 yards and 14 touchdowns, including 124 yards and two touchdowns in the 2015 Rose Bowl win over Florida State.
MISCUES: Oregon State has turned the ball over 14 times this season, the second-worst total in the FBS ahead of only San Jose State. Even worse, opponents have turned those four interceptions and 10 fumbles lost into 79 points (10 touchdowns, three field goals). The only time Oregon State hasn't allowed a score after turning the ball over came last week against the Huskies, when safety David Morris intercepted a pass to get the ball back after running back Artavis Pierce fumbled.

The cost of improprieties at Fox News Channel continues to grow for the cable-news outlet's parent, 21st Century Fox.
The media conglomerate, controlled by the Murdoch family, disclosed in a filing Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had paid out $50 million in its recently completed fiscal 2017 “settlements of claims arising out of allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at the Company's Fox News Channel business.” In May, the company had revealed it paid out $10 million in the first three months of the year, and in June, it revealed the total to be $45 million.
The disclosure shows the toll the corporate culture that had been in place at the cable network before the ouster last year of former chief Roger Ailes continues to have on the parent company, which also owns Fox Broadcasting, the FX cable network, the 20th Century Fox movie studio and a portion of the Hulu video-streaming service. While Fox said in its filing that it does not expect the total amount of costs related to settlements to be material, it did list legal matters related to Fox News as a “risk factor” in its operations, noting that executives have ” received regulatory and investigative inquiries and stockholder demands to inspect the books and records of the Company which could lead to future litigation.” The company also noted that its “primetime lineup has significantly changed which could have a negative impact on our ratings.”
Fox News has been under scrutiny since Ailes departed under a cloud, accused of sexual harassment by former anchor Gretchen Carlson and a number of other current and former employees. Ailes, who passed away earlier this year, denied the allegations. Since that time, however, Fox News has been beset with a growing number of lawsuits and charges of various kinds of improprieties. Bill O'Reilly, its best known primetime anchor, left the network in April, and Bill Shine, its co-president, left a few weeks later. Two hosts, Charles Payne and Eric Bolling, have been suspended pending investigations into recent allegations of sexual harassment, charges which both of the men have denied.
21st Century Fox has installed several new senior female executives at Fox News Channel and reworked the company's human-resources department. What's more, the network continues to investigate allegations in an eyebrow-raising legal complaint alleging Fox News worked with the White House to disseminate fake news about the death of murdered former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, making claims in a now-retracted online article that Rich was linked to a leak of DNC emails to Wikileaks.
The continuing charges erupt at a sensitive time for the parent company. Fox remains keen to snap up the 61% of the British satellite-broadcaster Sky it does not already own. 21st Century Fox reached a deal late last year to buy the remaining Sky stake for $15.2 billion – a pact that would give Fox enormous global heft. As AT&T prepares to acquire Time Warner and as Fox continues to negotiate with giant distributors like Comcast and Charter Communications, bringing Sky into the company would add new leverage, while its European news operations could lend new programming advantages to Fox News.
The legal settlements would not include money paid out to Ailes and O'Reilly when they departed. Ailes was believed to have received a payout totaling $40 million, while O'Reilly was believed to have received $25 million.
Fowlerville Man Heading To Trial In Fatal Crash
June 14, 2017
A Fowlerville man has been bound over for trial in connection to an October crash that killed a 10-year-old boy.
50-year-old Robert Earl Wilson was charged with one count of operating a vehicle under the influence causing death and three counts of operating a vehicle under the influence causing incapacitating injuries. He waived an exam Tuesday in 66th District Court in Corunna and was bound over to Shiawassee County Circuit Court to face trial.
The charges stem from the October 9th incident on Fowlerville Road, north of Lovejoy Road in Antrim Township. According to the Shiawassee County Sheriff's Department, Wilson was driving northbound when his minivan crossed the center line and hit a car carrying a family of four from Byron. A 10-year-old Fowlerville Community School student was killed in the crash. His parents were hospitalized with injuries ranging from severe to critical. The boy's sister was also injured. (JK)

Colin Ryan strikes over the winning point for Limerick from a '65. Source: Oisin Keniry/INPHO
HIS SIDE WERE in the winners enclosure after a thrilling marathon clash at the Gaelic Grounds but Limerick manager John Kiely wasn't entirely comfortable with their route to victory.
A pulsating 100 minutes of action saw the teams tied at 4-21 to 0-33 in yesterday's hurling league quarter-final before Limerick saw off Clare after Colin Ryan was on target and Niall Deasy was off target in a sudden death 65-yard free-taking shootout.
January's Walsh Cup final saw the landmark game where Wexford defeated Kilkenny in those circumstances but last evening's televised encounter between Limerick and Clare drew the new rule into sharper focus.
“Ah sure not at all, it's not the way to finish a game but it is what it is, we can't control it, it's outside of our control,” Kiely told TG4 after the game.
“But it certainly is not the way any person involved in hurling wants to see a match finish coming down to taking 65′s like that.
“Yes ideally you'd like to go at it again but it's just not to be and that's it. I don't know has Donal (Moloney) been thrown something like that before but I certainly haven't.
“It was unusual but listen there was no separating us during the playing time so, we know we're out of weekends so we can't go to another fixture. This is just the way it is and we've to get on with it.”
Clare counterpart Donal Moloney admitted it wasn't a satisfactory way for a match to end.
“Not at all (satisfactory). I think for the spectators here as well, given the fact that some of the other quarter-finals were postponed, there was every opportunity to play this next weekend.
“I think it was some entertainment for everyone who was here and everyone who watched it at home as well. It was incredible hurling. Fair dues to both teams, they were fantastic.”
Kiely felt his team were fortunate to gain a reprieve when Diarmaid Byrnes's late extra-time goal rescued them and believes this match is a sign of a strong rivalry that is unfolding between the counties.
“I think we were fairly fortunate now to be honest with you. In that instance, it was the last play of the half, we got a 21-yard free, it was fortuitous from our point of view.
“You take the breaks. We had plenty chances and I know Clare had too. It was just one of those games, it ebbed and flowed. I think the spirit that the game was played in was a fantastic spirit.
“Both players know each other very well, they always go at it hammer and tongs and I just think this is the start of a long-running kind of competition between the two teams really because they're both very good sides.”

A routine fishing license check at a dam on the Des Moines River near Fort Dodge led to a chase and the arrest of a man wanted on two warrants.
State Conservation Officer Bill Spece says everything started Friday when he asked 30-year-old David Dayton of Fort Dodge for his fishing license . Spece says Dayton said he did not have a license and it turned into a foot chase and a scuffle to get him into custody. The foot chase started after Dayton gave Spece his brother's name instead of his own.
“The original name and date of birth that I was given, when I ran it is did show that individual had a warrant and that is what I was in the process of acting on,” Spece says. “And I did find out after getting him under control that he was not who he originally said and there were actually two warrants.” Spece says during the chase Dayton swung at him and hit him in the head, and he finally had to pull out his gun to arrest him.
“I did feel that he had intentions of harming me, so I did eventually draw the weapon after he did not listen to any commands to submit,” Spece says. Fort Dodge Police and Webster County deputies arrived to help out. Spece says this is the first time he's run into a situation like this and credits the training officers get for allowing him to handle it.
“Most individuals we deal with are very great people and very happy to see us out there checking licenses and appreciate the fact that we are protecting the resource. Very few people act like they don't want us out there,” according to Spece.
Dayton had two outstanding warrants, including a parole violation and failure to appear. He was charged with interference with official acts with bodily injury for the scuffle with Spece and was charged with fishing without a license. He was also found in possession of an unidentified substance, hypodermic syringes and other drug paraphernalia that will be tested at the DCI lab in Des Moines.Additional charges are pending.
Spece has been a conservation officer for a little more than one year. Prior to that he was an officer with the Eldora and Vinton police departments and the Marshal County Sheriff's office.
BERLIN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - New car sales in Germany jumped about 12 percent last month to about 270,000 vehicles, the highest level for January in nearly two decades, an auto industry source said.
But the downtrend in registrations of diesel-powered cars continued with a decline of about 17 percent, the source said on Friday on condition he not is named ahead of publication of official data.
“The new year got off to a good start,” the source said, noting that the increase resulted mainly from high private orders by at the end of 2017 and was not helped by additional selling days.
Germany's VDA auto industry association is expected to release official sales data for Europe's largest auto market later on Friday.
(Reuters) - UK's Cineworld (CINE.L) said its $3.6 billion deal to buy U.S. cinema chain Regal Entertainment (RGC.N) was on track to close in March after it secured support from a majority of its own shareholders and the largest investor in Regal on Friday.
Cineworld said 87.34 percent of votes cast at a general meeting in London on Friday were in favor of the deal.
Shareholder advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had urged investors last week to oppose the deal, citing “significant financial and operation risks.”
Other shareholder advisory firms, including PIRC, had recommended that investors back the takeover.
Late on Friday, Cineworld said in a market announcement that Denver-based The Anschutz Corporation - the largest shareholder in Regal Entertainment - has submitted its written consent to the deal.
Cineworld said all company and Regal shareholder approvals needed to go ahead with the deal have been received, adding that it expects to complete on or before March 2.
London-listed Cineworld agreed in December to buy Regal Entertainment through a reverse takeover funded with debt and a 1.7 billion pound ($2.42 billion) share sale.
The acquisition will give the British company a presence in the U.S. market and transform it into the world's second-biggest cinema chain by number of screens, with more than 9,500.
A majority of Cineworld shareholders also approved the share sale to fund the deal, the company said on Friday.
“As will be seen from the proxy votes, there was very strong support from shareholders for the acquisition,” Cineworld's Chairman Anthony Bloom said in a statement.
The takeover would put the combined company in a better position to take on industry leader AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N), and give it more scale to fight growing competition from Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and other digital outlets.
The Lagos State Government says its internally generated revenue for the first quarter of the year stood at N103.476 billion, as against N96.7 billion recorded in 2017, thereby accounting for 81 percent of the total revenue of N141 billion generated in the quarter.
Mr. Segun Banfo, the State Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget disclosed this during the annual Ministerial Press Briefing to mark the third year in office of Governor Ambode's administration held at the Bagauda Kaltho Press Centre in Alausa, said the records so far shows that the performance of the State's 2018 budget of N1.046trillion was heading in the right direction.
Giving a breakdown of the figures, the Commissioner said the budget performance for the first quarter has a pro-rata size of N261.530billion and in absolute term, it had performed N163.491bn, compared with N120.206billion reported for the same period in the year 2017.
In terms of revenue generation, Mr. Banjo said that the sum of N141billion (63 per cent) was generated as Total Revenue against N124.141billion (77 per cent) achieved in 2017, adding that this year's first quarter performance was N17.816billion higher than the previous year's performance in absolute terms.
He said out of the total revenue of N141billion the State internally generated N103.476billion representing 57 per cent, as against N96.7billion in the previous year, thereby accounting for 73 percent of the total revenue for the current fiscal year.
The Commissioner explained further that the Lagos Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) generated N84.1bilion in the first quarter, which accounted for 81 per cent of the total revenue generated, a feat, he attributed to proper planning and research by the government.
“What we have said now is that in the first quarter which we just concluded of 2018, LIRS generated a total of N84 billion compared to the N74billion that was generated in 2017. Due to the research and the planning done, LIRS has been able to improve their performance and we are very glad about it,” he said.
Mr. Banjo, however, noted that the N84billion generated by LIRS was excluding revenue from Land Use Charge (LUC), noting that it was from the strict application of taxes from Pay As You Earn (PAYE), withholding taxes, direct assessment and other taxes.
Besides, he said that Federal transfers for the first quarter year 2018 contributed N38.481billion (87 per cent) compared to a performance of N27.364billion out of which Statutory Allocation contributed N13.868billion and N24.4billion from Value Added Tax (VAT) for the same period in 2017.
“Under Capital Expenditure, Quarter 1 performance stood at N93billion (53 per cent) as against N46.7billion (37 per cent) as at the same period in the year 2017. As at the end of Q1 2018, the Capital: Recurrent ratio closed at 57:43 as against 39:61 recorded same time in Y2017.
“This is a pointer to the fact that all efforts geared towards tighter control of overhead is beginning to yield fruits even though more needs to be done in this area,” Mr. Banjo said.
He said the State Government would do everything within its powers to sustain the budget performance in the second quarter, adding that the ultimate goal was to meet the target of a Capital: Recurrent expenditure ratio of 67:33 throughout the year.
Responding to questions on the reduction in the rates payable by property owners under the Lagos State Land Use Charge Law, vis-a-vis the 2018 budget and its effects on the plans by the government to deliver all ongoing projects in the State, the Commissioner allayed fears, adding that the present administration had already fashioned out strategies to ensure prompt delivery of critical projects this year.
“Definitely we have made a projection but because this is a very responsive government, we have decided to give rebates and when you give rebates, automatically the revenue will go down, the expectation might not be there in terms of what we intended in the first instance. But we can assure you that whatever we lose from the rebate we would get it somewhere else because we would continue to up our game,” Mr. Banjo added.

Leadership Council to honor Teen Services Sonoma
Posted on October 6, 2017 by Sonoma Valley Sun
Teen Services Sonoma has been selected by the North Bay Leadership Council (NBLC) to a 2017 Leaders of the North Bay Award in the category of Empowering the Latino Community.
“This honor would not be possible without the love, energy, and expertise of so many amazing people who have been part of our history and our success,” said Cristin Felso, executive director of the Springs-based nonprofit. “I will be accepting this award next month with two of them: Rebecca Hermosillo and Jean Hopeman.”
Hermosillo, (now with Congressman Mike Thompson's office, was the executive director of the Valley of the Moon Teen Center (originally called El Nido) in 1995. “She recognized the need for a safe haven for Latino youth, a place where boundaries and tough love were coupled with respect and acceptance to help teens make good choices, Feslo said “She instilled a sense of family with her nightly dinners at the center, and guided four young Latinas in the formation of the Lovin' Oven – TSS's first micro-business.”
Hopeman, who combined a successful banking career with a Spanish language and literature major and a master's degree in Latin American Affairs, “became our rock,” Felso said. “Seeing that our teens needed to make money but did not know how to get a job, she started conversations with local employers to see what they were looking for in employees. This was the first step toward what we now call our Ready to Work program.” Hopeman served on the board, and was responsible for writing grants to fund the organization.
The award will be presented at a November 3 luncheon in Santa Rosa. The other 2017 honorees are:
United We Stand – Community Building: Susan McQuaid, Marin Court Appointed Special Advocates.
Paint the Community Green – Environmental Stewardship: Pepperwood
The “Light Bulb” Went On – Innovative/Entrepreneurial Spirit: Pat Harper, Keysight Technologies
From Red Tape to Red Carpet – Leadership within Government: Kimberly Carroll, Marin Housing Authority
“Many thanks to our forever friend, Steve Page, president of Sonoma Raceway, for nominating us, and to NBLC for selecting us for this honor,” Felso said. “It belongs to many, especially our teens.”

Rawalpindi
Regional Transport Authority (RTA) would take strict action in accordance with the law against transporters found involved in overcharging the passengers travelling on various routes in Rawalpindi, said Regional Transport Authority (RTA) Rawalpindi Secretary Khalid Yameen Satti. Talking to APP he said, the RTA officials have been directed to take action against transporters found involved in overcharging passengers. No one would be allowed to fleece commuters adding that the vehicles of those indulging in overcharging would be impounded. He said that a number of complaints have been lodged by the residents with the RTA regarding overcharging on various routes and warned the transporters not to violate the rules else strict action in accordance with the law would be taken against them.
The RTA secretary also directed transporters to display the fare lists for every destination at their respective terminals and in the vehicles at prominent places. To a question about fare increase by the transporters after revised fuel prices he said, so far, there was no revision in the fares of public transport and strict action would be taken against those fleecing the passengers.—APP
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co detailed new regulatory restrictions imposed by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Friday that sent its shares down sharply in after-hours trading, as the third-largest U.S. bank continues to reel from a sales scandal that erupted in 2016.
Wells is not allowed to grow beyond the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of last year “until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls,” the Fed said in a statement.
Wells Fargo estimated that the cap will cut its annual profit by $300 million to $400 million this year, as it reduces some parts of its balance sheet, like corporate deposits and trading assets, in order to continue growing core businesses. That represents 1.5 to 1.9 percent of the profit Wells generated in 2017.
The bank will also replace three board members by April and a fourth board member by the end of the year, the Fed said, without naming who they should be.
Wells Fargo shares fell 6.1 percent to $60.10 in after-hours trading.
The Fed's consent order will have a “manageable” impact on profits and should not affect the bank's plans to return capital to shareholders this year, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said during a conference call with analysts on Friday evening.
“We are in a very competitive business whether we have a consent order or not,” said Sloan. “Our marching orders to our team are, go out and serve your customers, fulfill our vision, take deposits, make loans. We are open for business.”
While Sloan said he takes the matter seriously, he also characterized it as the latest step in a risk-management and corporate governance overhaul that Wells Fargo began some time ago, when it realized it had a serious problem with sales practices.
The bank reached a $190 million settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a Los Angeles prosecutor in September 2016 over employees opening phony accounts in customers' names without their permission to artificially hit internal targets. The tally of fake accounts has since risen to as many as 3.5 million.
Regulators have rarely intervened directly in a bank's operations in the past, and it is unprecedented for the Fed to order a bank to stop growing altogether, officials said.
But Wells Fargo's aggressive business strategy prioritized growth over effective risk management, leading to serious compliance breakdowns, the central bank said.
Wells Fargo's balance sheet expanded steadily from the end of 2013 to 2016, but growth slowed dramatically last year as it battled to address the issues raised by the scandal.
The bank must submit a plan to the Fed within 60 days detailing how it has enhanced oversight from its board of directors and improved compliance and risk management functions, and how it plans to improve further. Once the Fed approves those plans, Wells will hire third-party consultants to review them and monitor its progress until the regulator is satisfied.
The San Francisco Fed and top regulatory officials in Washington will lead the review, the central bank said.
”We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank,” said Chair Janet Yellen in a statement on her final day as leader of the central bank.
Since the 2016 settlement, Wells has taken steps to enhance oversight at the board level, centralize risk-management functions and install new executives to oversee key businesses and control functions. Its board chair, Betsy Duke, is a former Fed governor, and it recently hired Sarah Dahlgren, a former New York Fed official, as its head of regulatory relations.

Angela Merkel, German Chancellor and leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union party CDU, speaks at the start of the CDU's election rally for Germany's general election in Dortmund, Germany, August 12, 2017.
DORTMUND, Germany (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel kicked off her re-election campaign on Saturday with a stinging attack on German auto executives, pressing them to innovate to secure jobs, and win back trust lost by a diesel emissions scandal.
Merkel is far ahead of her rivals in opinion polls but, wary of complacency setting in among her supporters, she plans 50 rallies in towns and cities across Germany in the run-up to the Sept. 24 election, when she will seek a fourth term in office.
With her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) campaigning on a platform of economic stability, Merkel ripped into auto industry executives for destroying trust in the sector - Germany's biggest exporter and provider of some 800,000 jobs.
"Large sections of the auto industry have gambled away unbelievable amounts of trust," she told a rally in Dortmund, in the heart of the Ruhr area that was at the center of Germany's post-war 'economic miracle' but which is now a rust-belt.
"This is trust that only the auto industry can restore. And when I say 'the industry' that is the company leaders," she added, to loud applause, pressing executives to behave honestly.
By turning on auto industry executives, Merkel is trying to both push the sector to innovate and to head off a drive for more social justice in Germany from her main challenger, Martin Schulz of the left-leaning Social Democratic Party (SPD).
Germany has enjoyed solid growth since Merkel took office in November 2005, and unemployment has fallen to record lows. Yet many people earn low wages and feel left behind in a globalized economy that has seen the gap grow between rich and poor.
That sense of injustice and economic angst has been fueled by Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitting almost two years ago to cheating U.S. diesel emissions tests, a confession that plunged Germany's auto sector into crisis.
Earlier this month, German politicians and car bosses agreed to overhaul engine software on 5.3 million diesel cars to cut pollution and try to repair the industry's battered reputation.
But many politicians fear Germany's carmakers are failing to invest enough in new technology and infrastructure.
Wading into the debate, a Greens party state premier defended the diesel technology at the center of Germany's car industry crisis, saying it was a necessary interim solution on the way to electric cars.
Winfried Kretschmann, premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg - home to Mercedes-maker Daimler, Porsche and Robert Bosch - said diesel was a clean technology that helped reduce the carbon-dioxide emissions blamed for global warming.

"We must cut pollution, we must fight climate change - for which we need clean diesel ... and we must secure the car industry in Germany, especially in Baden-Wuerttemberg," Kretschmann told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
E-CAR QUOTAS
Merkel rejected a proposal made by Schulz to introduce quotas for electric cars in Europe.
"I don't think that the quota for E-cars - for this technology - has been well thought out," she said at the rally of her CDU and its employers' arm.

"Then we would negotiate for ages in Europe. What would we do if it is not adhered to?" she added of the quota.
Instead, Merkel called for a bigger picture strategy for helping the auto industry make the transition to producing electric cars.
"We need to innovate quickly," she said. "Where companies can't manage it alone, the government must stand behind them and shove things along."
Merkel's government has come under mounting pressure for not doing enough to crack down on vehicle pollution and for being too close to powerful carmakers. She has repeatedly warned against "demonizing" diesel engines.
"We need diesel cars, we need petrol cars, but we also need to make the transition faster to new technologies," she said.
Her conservatives have promised tax cuts worth some 15 billion euros ($17.72 billion) annually as well as increased spending on infrastructure, defense and security.
Merkel and the conservatives are expected to win another term, although an opinion poll by Infratest dimap published on Thursday suggested her popularity had dropped 10 percentage points to 59 percent.
However, Merkel appears to have little to fear as Schulz saw his popularity hit a new low of 33 percent, down four points from last month.

The Forestry Commission Ladies Association on Tuesday donated assorted items to Pantang Hospital as part of its 5th anniversary celebration.
The items valued at GHC 6,000.00 include; bags of rice, cooking oil, detergents, bread, toilet rolls, and among others.
Ms Stella Sankah, the National Secretary of the Association in an interview with the Ghana News Agency in Accra said the gesture formed part of the Association's corporate social responsibility in responding to the needs of the underprivileged in the community.
She said the Planning Committee thought it prudent to extend their hands to the Hospital because of the Hospital's call for support.
Ms Sankah said their outfit mobilised money with the support of male staff of the Commission, even though it was a ladies Association.
“Health delivery is crucial to the development of any country and as such it was important for all and sundry to extend our love to inmates of Mental Hospital for them to be happy”, she added.
She said the Association believed that ‘there is blessing in giving than receiving' and encouraged other corporate institutions to support the Hospital to complement government's efforts to improve health care.
Ms Sankah appealed to the public to use special days such as birthdays and anniversaries to visit and donate to Mental Institutions as a sign of love.
She said the Association as part of activities to mark the anniversary embarked on a health walk last Saturday and would climax the programme on Thursday 26 April with a durbar with Mrs Samira Bawumia, wife of the Vice President as the Guest of Honour.
Mr Elvis Akuamoah, Head of Communication, Pantang Hospital thanked the Association for the donation and pledged to distribute the items to the inmates.
He said Mental Health institutions were facing many challenges and appealed to the public to periodically support the Hospitals to improve health delivery.

As of Oct. 1, the state of Alabama is offering paid leave for living organ and bone-marrow donors.
Before that, if you donated an organ or bone-marrow, you were having to use your sick days or vacation days to take the time off.
“It will help employees be able to donate a life-saving organ or bone marrow because they will not have to use their leave in order to do so,” said Brittany Bryan, the Governmental Affairs Manager for the State Personnel Department.
Under the new policy, a state employee with at least one year of state service will be granted paid leave if they donate an organ or bone-marrow.
“We are so excited to be able to offer this to employees who are willing and able to donate an organ so they do not have to exhaust their leave, and employees would get up to 30 days leave for donating an organ and up to seven days of leave for donating bone marrow,” said Bryan.
This was a policy UAB's Robert Gaston pushed for.
“The idea that anybody should have to sacrifice their own resources to be a living donor apart from the act itself, sort of, is something that a lot of attention is being devoted to nationally now and it's very good to see this start to happen in Alabama,” said Gaston.
They're hoping this new policy will also encourage people to become organ donors.

That's where Radar comes in.
Radar was founded by Nick Patrick, former Foursquare and Handy employee, along with his fellow Foursquarer Coby Berman, after realizing that lots of apps need location services, but it's tedious and difficult to build out on the back end.
Patrick recounted trying to build location tools that would help track Handy cleaners on behalf of Handy customers and wondering why some back-end service didn't already exist to help with that.
So Patrick and Berman built out Radar and are today launching it out of Expa Labs.
Radar lets customers integrate with the Radar SDK and instantly start setting up geofences, tracking entry and exit events, and ultimately using that data to create a better experience for end-user.
Patrick sees three buckets where Radar could significantly help a developer: increasing engagement, increasing revenue, and improving operations.
You can imagine how Tinder might benefit from sending you a ping when a user you've already matched with is within a few blocks of you. Or how retail stores might use your location to send you special deals or offers if you're near the store. And finally, services like Handy and Postmates could stop building out location tracking services for their couriers and simply tie in to Radar to offer real-time location information to waiting end-customers.
“The biggest challenge is creating a tool that spans so many use cases elegantly,” said Patrick.
Radar launches publicly today, offering a free tier for folks who wish to try out the service, and an enterprise tier for people who need hands-on support. The enterprise tier is priced based on usage.
This extra location data is stored with Radar, keeping personally identifiable information separate from the actual location data, ensuring privacy for the end-user.
Radar has only received funding from Expa Labs ($125,000).

VALPARAISO, Ind. (AP): A gold coin donated to a northwestern Indiana church is so rare it's helping pay for construction of a new church building.
A woman who's a member of GracePoint Church in Valparaiso donated the coin to help finance a new church building for the congregation, which has held services in an elementary school since its founding in 2009.
Sarah Miller of Heritage Auctions says the $20 gold piece is one of only 10 knowns surviving 1866 Liberty Head double eagles stamped with “In God we trust.” It could fetch more than $300,000 when it's sold at auction April 27.
Pastor Ben Lamb says Heritage Auctions wired the church $150,000 for advance payment toward the coin's final auction price and that's allowed construction to begin already on the new building.
Those Affected By Trump's Travel Ban Hope For End To 'Chaos' After Supreme Court Case

At the New York City cell phone shop where he does his homework, nine-year-old Ahmed Alhuthaifi says he misses his mom a lot.
"Sometimes, I feel like I am going to cry," he says. "Trump won't let her in."
After a years-long effort, his mother, who is stuck in Saudi Arabia, was denied a visa due to President Trump's restrictions on immigration and travel from certain countries, including Yemen. She and Ahmed's four younger siblings, who live with her, missed Ahmed's birthday celebrations on April 3.
"He expected them to be here, all his brothers and sisters; he's depressed all the time," says Fathi Alhuthaifi, his father. "I need my wife and kids. We are in a bad situation."
On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a case challenging the ban as discriminatory and unconstitutional. Administration lawyers insist the ban, in effect in full since early December, is a national security necessity.
Alhuthaifi is an American citizen. He emigrated from Yemen more than 20 years ago and runs a successful cell phone business on West 145th St. in Harlem. He named his youngest son McCain, after the Arizona Republican senator he admires.
"As soon as you step your feet in this country, you feel you are part of the country," he says. But the administration's travel ban has dashed his dream of uniting his family in New York. All his kids have U.S. passports, but the younger ones, he explains, can't be without their mother, who is not a U.S. citizen.
"We thought we were very lucky. It's a dream country. But the time has changed," he says.
The ban, issued in September, restricts travel from Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Somalia and Yemen. Chad, originally on the list, was removed earlier this month.
Whatever the outcome in the Supreme Court, the Trump ban has already sown "chaos" in affected families across the country, says Muna Jondy, a Michigan immigration lawyer of Syrian descent who counsels families in the U.S. whose relatives are now barred from joining them.
"My clients are freaking out," she says. "This causes chaos with work visas, student visas, bringing families here."

The Yemeni-American Merchants Association of New York mounted a one-hour protest Tuesday, the day before the Supreme Court hearing. Zaid Alnagi, the association's vice president, distributed posters across the city and created hashtags for a social media campaign, #IamAmericanToo and #BodegaStrike.
"The executive order, at its heart, says Yemeni people are bad and they need to stay away. We say no! We are part of the fabric of the country," says Alnagi, an American citizen who has not been able to bring his mother to New York. Her visa was denied this year.
President Trump's campaign pledge for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" is at the center of the Supreme Court debate. The president's executive orders did not cite religion but rather security concerns that motivated his ban.
"It's not a Muslim ban and it never has been — the whole Muslim ban narrative is little better than a hoax," says Mark Krikorian, executive director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies and a White House advisor on immigration. He supports stricter limits on the current immigration system.
"The travel ban targets specific, terrorism-infected countries and, as a practical matter, would apply to a relatively small share of the world's Muslims," he says.
Critics of the ban, including a judge in Hawaii who ruled against the ban, charge that the biggest burden is felt in the Muslim-majority nations on the list.
"No national from any of the countries impacted is responsible for a death from terrorists on U.S. soil since 1975," says Joshua Geltzer, one of 52 former national security officials who submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, declaring that the Trump administration has failed the show how the travel ban bolsters national security.
He argues that the countries subjected to the ban "don't seem to have any resemblance to where terrorism threats are emanating from."
"The thing that is frustrating is it's stereotyping," says Dr. Ziad Alnabki, a Syrian-American cardiologist in Jacksonville, Fla. "We can't just label all of them terrorists and close the door for them coming in."
Alnabki first came to the U.S. more than a decade ago for his medical residency in Tennessee, after graduating first in his class from Damascus University. After Syria descended into a brutal civil war, Alnabki applied for immigrant visas for his parents. After years of waiting, they finally got an interview this year at the U.S. embassy in Cairo.
"We were shocked when their application was denied at the beginning of the year. The travel ban came along and we couldn't get them here," he says.
"I love my job, it's the most rewarding thing in my life," says Alnabki, who works in a cardiac unit. "I take care of patients, and the son or the daughter gives me a hug. But at the same time, I can't have my parents next to me here so I can see them and they can see my kids."
While the ban allows for case-by-case waivers, those waivers are rare. According to Reuters, about 100 waivers were granted between December and early March. More than 8,000 had applied for U.S. visas in that period from countries affected by the ban.
The letter informing Alnabki that his parents would not be granted visas also said they were not eligible for a waiver.
"It's totally arbitrary," says Jondy, the Michigan-based immigration lawyer, who handled Alnabki's case. "One client who is a doctor, his parents are stranded in Cairo; but another family in Damascus did get a waiver. They are Christians," she says.
She says the few cases she's handled don't show a pattern yet, but she advises her clients who are Christian to include their religious affiliation in the application. She says those who do so have been granted waivers.
"I am doing things like putting in a baptismal certificate," she says. "That is not normally the evidence that you submit in a waiver application, but it has worked."
Jondy says she fields hundreds of panicked calls and text messages from clients who plead for help. The stress, says this second-generation immigrant and American citizen, has been overwhelming for all concerned.
"You just can't have an arbitrary policy that's based on discrimination against Muslims," she says, which is her view of the travel ban. "It's just basically, 'We don't want them here and so let's find a way to get them not to come here.' "
A warning has been issued to parents that dangerous and inconsiderate parking during the school run is putting children's lives at risk.
The SaferPeterborough Prevention and Enforcement Service (PES) operates a school enforcement programme and has penalised drivers for a number of incidents of dangerous parking outside Peterborough's schools.
Enforcement officers outside Queen's Drive Infant School
PES officers have carried out more than 680 school visits over the past year, often due to concerns raised about parking by headteachers, teachers and parents, and issued around 200 penalty charge notices since April 2016.
The schools in the city that have been visited the most include Queen's Drive Infant School in Queen's Drive West, Arthur Mellows Village College in Glinton, Discovery Primary School in Walton, and Paston Ridings Primary School in Paston.
Sarah Skinner, headteacher of Queen's Drive Infant School, said: “Parents parking their cars badly outside our school is a big problem. I fear it is only a matter of time before a pupil is seriously hurt due to this irresponsible and dangerous parking.”
The PES team, which combines city council, police, fire service and prison staff into a single managed service, can deploy a CCTV vehicle outside schools to crack down on motorists who are parking on yellow markings outside the school gates.
Evidence collected by the cameras is used to issue penalty charge notices to offenders.
Councillor Irene Walsh, cabinet member for communities and environment capital, said: “Dangerous parking outside schools is a real problem in Peterborough and we urge parents and drivers to think about the potentially disastrous consequences that this may cause to children's lives.
“We hear from an increasing number of parents worried about their children's safety outside schools including in my own ward at Hampton Hargate Primary School.
“Cars are parked on pavements which are meant to be safe routes for children. Drivers are reversing close to school gates and parking on double yellow or zig zag lined areas and again this puts children in danger as they walk or cycle to school.
“The yellow zig zag lines provided outside schools are there to protect children, making the road safer to cross. The Prevention and Enforcement Service cannot patrol outside every school and I would implore parents to be more responsible on the school run.
“We ask that parents and drivers work with us by leaving enough time to park further away from the school gates and walking the last part of their journey.”
The PES officers have the ability to take action against a wider range of community issues.
The public can report issues and concerns via the MyPeterborough app or they can call 101 or 01733 747474.
A £40 million merger between the distribution arm of John Menzies and DX Group has been scrapped.
It follows a profit warning by DX Group earlier this year in which it cautioned over “challenging” trading conditions, and a management overhaul at the parcel delivery and logistics firm last month.
The firms had been in discussions about DX acquiring John Menzies' distribution unit for £40 million, announced in June.
But John Menzies said in a stock market announcement that, following additional due diligence on DX Group following a July trading update, it “became apparent” that any deal would require revised terms.
For that reason, despite “strong strategic and commercial benefits” which would arise from a tie-up, the deal has been “terminated”.
John Menzies said: “Despite further discussions with DX following the DX announcement of 14 July 2017, the John Menzies board does not believe it is currently possible to agree a revised set of terms with DX for the combination which would be in the interests of John Menzies shareholders.
“John Menzies has therefore terminated discussions with DX.”
The announcement also comes just over a month after City of London Police dropped plans for a probe into DX Group.
John Menzies said it continues to believe there is merit in separating its aviation and distribution divisions into two independent businesses at the “appropriate time”.

On Jan. 23 Anthony Jett, Sr. took his new position as the first Associate Director for the Black Student Center.
Jett said he plans for the Black Student Center to be a place that students can call their own. He expects students to have healthy conversations about issues in which they can identify.
Jett says the Black Student Center will help students graduate because of its multiple resources like computers and study spaces.
Jett plans to work with all centers on campus. He gave his support to the Latin@ Center, especially after President Trump's plans. He is also willing to work with veterans so they can receive the needed help.
In the short time of the center's opening, students ask about resources, and part-time jobs said Jett.
The center has an open door policy, and everyone of any ethnicity is welcome. Students can learn about African-American history at the center.
Jett has a passion to work with low income and first generation students because he relates to them. He is currently working on his doctoral degree in education leadership.
He is taking all recommendations from students and faculty in hope that the center will become fundamental for future centers.
“It's about diversity and inclusion, not about diversity and exclusion… This is the one spot where everyone can come and work together and see each other,” said Jett.
The center's ribbon cutting ceremony will be on Feb. 23 or 28, depending upon President Haynes' availability.
Average retail gasoline prices in West Virginia rose 0.4 cents per gallon last week, averaging $2.31/g yesterday, according to GasBuddy's daily survey of 1,154 gas outlets in West Virginia.
This compares with the national average that has increased 2.7 cents per gallon in the last week to $2.28/g, according to gasoline price website GasBuddy.com.
Including the change in gas prices in West Virginia during the past week, prices Dec. 26 were 36.5 cents per gallon higher than the same day one year ago and are 18.3 cents per gallon higher than a month ago. The national average has increased 16.5 cents per gallon during the last month and stands 28.4 cents per gallon higher than that day one year ago.
According to GasBuddy historical data, gasoline prices on Dec.27 in West Virginia have ranged widely over the last five years: $1.95/g in 2015, $2.48/g in 2014, $3.33/g in 2013, $3.38/g in 2012 and $3.34/g in 2011.
Areas near West Virginia and their current gas price climate: Pittsburgh – $2.48/g, up 2.6 cents per gallon from last week's $2.45/g. Charleston – $2.30/g, flat from last week's $2.30/g. Virginia – $2.15/g, up 2.2 cents per gallon from last week's $2.13/g.
“While the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude closed last week near $53 per barrel, it's doubtful that we'll see any momentum this week since trading is generally low volume between Christmas and New Year's Day. Similarly, expect the aggressive escalation that we saw for retail gasoline prices through much of December to stall out in the final week of the year,” said Gregg Laskoski, senior petroleum analyst for GasBuddy.
“Overall, the national average price of gas is 28 cents higher than where it was a year ago on this day and prices in most metros and states across the country are higher too; with the remarkable exception being California whose statewide average today is 13 cents lower than last year and the Los Angeles' average, believe it or not, is 27 cents less than a year ago,” Laskoski noted.
Almazbek Atambayev, who stepped down from the post of the president of Kyrgyzstan on November 24, vacated a house in the state residence Ala-Archa and moved to another country house. The head of the Department of Presidential Affairs of Kyrgyzstan, Turusbek Koenaliyev, informed Azattyk.
According to him, former President Almazbek Atambayev moved to another country house, and the house where President Sooronbai Jeenbekov will live and work, has already been repaired.
Turusbek Koenaliyev said that the new office of the president and the house where he will live are ready.
FACTS OF THE DAY
Today is World Sparrow Day. Not to be confused with the Westerosi network of informers.
A Taphophile is someone obsessed with graveyards.
A Grade 11 student at Claremont Secondary School in Saanich has won the top prize at the Canada Wide Science Fair.
Nicolas Fedrigo won the platinum award in the senior division for his work on redesigning the pedicle probe which is used by surgeons in spinal fusions.
“I was really quite amazed and never thought I would win platinum and I was shocked when they called my name.”
For his project, Fedrigo made some advances on what is called a pedicle probe. Pedicle probes are medical devices used by surgeons to create pilot holes to guide the placement of pedicle screws for spinal fusions. He says the current method is behind in the times.
“Currently with the traditional pedicle probe, you are doing it blindly. And as you can assume when you are pushing a pointy thing with a handle into someone's back and it's off by half a degree that could cause paralysis.”
Nicolas improved the probe, so surgeons can have better navigation.
The Canada Wide Science Fair had over 500 participants and Fedrigo says he is the first person from Vancouver Island to win the top prize.
His project also got him a first-place finish in the Vancouver Island Regional Science Fair.
” I think what they most liked about my project is that that I did it all by myself at home. A lot of the other projects at the fair were done under a researcher that is top in the field. They told me they liked how independent I was.”

Drug dealers in Cambridgeshire have been selling Class A drugs laced with bleach to children, according to police intelligence.
Information shared with officers suggests MDMA in the shape of mini-grenades is being peddled in the community.
Partner agencies and members of the public have helped support Cambridgeshire police's Operation Cippus.
Four people were arrested in a drugs raids in Wisbech today (April 24) as part of the operation.
Three men, aged, 26, 30 and 36 and a 30-year-old woman, all from Wisbech, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply Class A drugs.
The individuals all remain in custody at the Police Investigation Centre in King's Lynn.
Last month, the News joined detectives on a drugs raid on a property in Cambridge where dealers were pushing heroin and crack cocaine.
That operation came as the screw is being tightened on dealers taking over homes of disabled, elderly and vulnerable people to use as bases in Cambridge.

Nobody yet knows who greased the palms of the Barbados Tridents at the Queen's Park Oval last night; Sunil Narine is certainly not complaining!
The mystery-spinner-turned-Trinbago-Knight-Riders-opening-batsman rode his luck to hit 79, his career highest score in T20 cricket, and lead the home team to their fourth win in five matches and the top of the six-team CPL 2017 table.
On no fewer than three occasions, the new pinch-hitting opener was gifted a new life, the ball somehow never coming to rest finally in the greasy palms of the Tridents fielders.
His 79 featured five sixes, with deep mid-wicket their preferred destination, and came off just 45 balls to lift the TKR to 155 for 8 off 19.1 overs in a successful chase of the Tridents' 152 for 9 off their 20 overs.
Wicket-less in that innings, Man-of-the-match Narine had produced a tight economical four-over spell of 0-16 to help restrict the Tridents. But it was with the bat that he beat them–with the cooperation of Pollard's errant fieldsmen.
In his post-match comments, the Tridents skipper conceded that they had ended some 20 runs short of his desired target but his biggest disappointment was, unsurprisingly, his team's fielding so far in the CPL.
“Words cannot describe how abysmal we were in the field today,” a visibly frustrated Pollard told the assembled media. “At this level, certain things are unacceptable. Eight catches (dropped) in four games. We're keeping count of it,”
Even if the Tridents' skipper and coaching staff manage to do something about the team's fielding, there is another problem over which they have no control.
Reports out of Pakistan suggest that ten players will be recalled by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) from the CPL, citing a tight domestic and international schedule over the next few months. The Board has now scheduled the National T20 Cup from 25 August to 10 September to accommodate the late finalization of the ICC World XI Series, which is carded to run between the 10 and 16 September
The visitors stand to lose both leading Tridents' wicket-taker Wahab Riaz and the classy Shoaib Malik, top scorer on the night with 51 from 38 balls.
“It is what it is,” a resigned Pollard commented. “It happened last year as well and I think it's something that we need to get right. All the final decisions haven't been made but I think we still have a couple games before that happens.”
TKR captain Dwayne Bravo had little to offer on the issue but he is almost certainly concerned as well. Leg-spinner Shadab Khan, Man-of-the-match in the Knight Riders' first two games and a consistent contributor to the team's success so far this season, will also have to depart if the PCB does not change its mind.
Last night too, Shadab's contribution was not to be sneezed at, the fan favourite finishing with figures of 4-0-20-1 and being the single-handed architect of one of two run-outs in the Tridents innings.
Virtually unknown when he played his first game at the Oval a week ago, the teenage spinner's appearance now inspires a roar loud enough to rival the one given hometown hero Narine.
And if Shadab and Narine repeatedly steal the headlines for TKR this season, the T&T left-arm spinner Khary Pierre has quietly been making a major contribution to team success. Selected by Bravo as his opening bowler, he added the early wicket of the dangerous Dwayne Smith to the three catches he took against the Warriors last night, none of them easy.
Smith clobbered his first two balls over and then to the boundary ropes. Pierre, though, had the last laugh, tempting Smith to try to repeat the stroke. Third time unlucky, he succeeded only in finding the safe hands of Darren Bravo on the mid-wicket boundary.
Ronsford Beaton, omitted in favour of new arrival Robert Frylinck for the last two matches, accounted for the promoted Wayne Parnell in his first over. The South African mistimed his drive and saw the electric Brendon McCullum acrobatically pluck the ball out of the air at short cover.
The score was 19 for 2 at that stage with Kane Williamson and Malik at the crease. Swashbuckling, blade-to-ball batsman they are not; classy, cerebral and determined they, however, are. The pair began to rebuild the Tridents' innings, content to simply nudge the Knight Riders dangerous spin twins, Shadab and Narine, around for singles; the risk-taking would come later when that pairing was safely out of the way.
It worked. Together the pair combined in a partnership of 70 runs, a platform from which the Tridents could launch an all-out attack in the second ten overs.
Needing a wicket, Bravo turned to the spin twins and they delivered in tandem in the 12th over. Trying to sweep Shadab, the Kiwi skipper mistimed his shot and the ball invitingly popped up for Narine to run from short third man to pouch a simple catch behind the wicketkeeper.
Pollard, the in-form Tridents' captain, was next in and Pollard is a prime platform performer, his last two innings yielding destructive, hard-hit half-centuries late in the piece.
Pressed into service, Beaton (2 for 24) first induced Malik into error to leave the Tridents' unsteady at 102 for 4 and then attacked the more imposing Pollard with a barrage of short-pitched bowling with the occasional yorker in the mix.
It was an engaging contest that provoked the exchange of a few choice words between aggressive bowler and stymied batsman. Cricket, lovely cricket!
Bravo and Beaton might have dampened Pollard's ammo but it didn't work with the Tridents' other Trinis.
The explosive Nicholas Pooran hammered two massive sixes and a boundary before being dismissed for 18 while Akeal Hosein launched Bravo into orbit with sixes off consecutive balls before Bravo spiked his guns and brought Pollard low with the last ball of the innings.
But the late power hitting had taken the Tridents to a competitive total just five runs adrift of what TKR had chased down the night before. And the early wicket of McCullum, spectacularly yorked by Parnell, put the wind in their sails.
It could have got even better for the Tridents an over later but for the slippery fingers of Tino Best. Narine skied a catch to the eccentric former West Indies pacer at deepish mid-on. Grassing the chance, he held his head in his hands. It wasn't long before he had company.
Springer dropped Narine again off Riaz and Barnwell did the same later, twice in the space of a few deliveries, But unfazed by his let-offs, Narine rampaged on, superbly upper-cutting Riaz over third man. There were many great Narine shots on the night but that was the pick of them.
At the other end, the dangerous Munro, hero of the previous night's victory over the Amazon Warriors, didn't enjoy Narine's luck, picking out the wrong man, Dwayne Smith, on the boundary off the bowling of Malik.
The younger Bravo joined Narine at the crease and the pair moved the score merrily along, Bravo producing a few elegant dashes through the off-side especially, along the way.
He made it to an a-run-a-ball 25 before Riaz decided to take matters into his own hands. After Narine was dropped again off him, the unlucky Pakistani pacer produced a corker of a bouncer to send the younger Bravo packing.
The ball leapt at him like a trained canine and he must have been relieved eventually that it merely feathered his gloves for Pooran behind the stumps to take the catch.
On 76 for 3 after 10 overs, the Riders seemed in the driver's seat, with Narine continuing to play freely. And with good fortune.
Pollard's disdain was reflected in his face. And Narine added insult to unacceptability by generally following up every dropped catch with a boundary.
He was finally caught with the score at 145 for 7, Parnell showing his teammates how it's done with a simple catch off the bowling of Springer (3 for 32).
When, with only a few runs left to get for victory, Searles threw his wicket away, a few TKR fans' hearts might have skipped a beat or two.
But Cooper calmly pierced the infield with an off-drive to produce the win-sealing boundary.
TKR's next assignment is tomorrow against the currently high-flying Patriots, who have won all three of their CPL 2017 encounters so far. Bravo's men will be buoyed by their three-out-of-four successes in their five-match home schedule so far. And their comfortable placing atop the standings on eight points.
But the situation could have been so different had Pollard's Tridents not let things slip.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. film and TV studio The Weinstein Company plans to file for bankruptcy in Delaware as soon as Monday night with an offer for the company in hand from private equity firm Lantern Capital, a person familiar with the matter said.

An investor group led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet terminated its offer for the company earlier this month.
The bid from Lantern will set the floor for higher and better offers for the studio in a bankruptcy court-supervised auction, added the person.
The Weinstein Company has been looking for a buyer since its ex-chairman Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual misconduct, including rape, by more than 70 women. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.
Spokespeople for The Weinstein Company and Lantern Capital did not immediately return calls for comment. The source could not be identified because the person was not authorized to speak to the media.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit against the company and Bob and Harvey Weinstein last month, alleging that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed employees and the company failed to respond. Bob Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein's brother, co-founded the company and is co-chairman.
The lawsuit complicated negotiations for Contreras-Sweet's deal.
Reuters reported last month that the Weinstein Company was looking for a loan that would carry it through its bankruptcy.
Hollywood trade publication Deadline Hollywood first reported that The Weinstein Company planned to file for bankruptcy as soon as Monday.

Pittsburgh Pirates players went with personal experiences or non-baseball passions when deciding what they'd be doing if they didn't play professional baseball. Jason Dill Bradenton Herald
Our record high temperature was in jeopardy yet again this afternoon as mild air quickly warmed us back into the upper 70s. Montgomery hit 79 degrees, which was just one degree shy of the old record high temperature set back on Jan. 14, 1932 of 80 degrees. We will be keeping an eye on the record books over the next couple of days as temperatures continue to stay well above average for this time of year, but could this extra warmth finally mean some higher rain coverage and maybe even a chance of a thunderstorm or two?
Tonight: Drier air aloft along with a mostly clear sky currently and a calm wind will allow temperatures to fall quickly this evening into the upper 40s and low 50s. Clouds are slowly building in coverage from the west, but overall tonight many of us will only deal with a few clouds mixed in. Just like on Saturday morning, some of the colder temperatures will occur across the southern counties where the sky looks to stay cleared.
Now, temperatures are expected to fall just below the dewpoint values we saw this afternoon, so there is a chance a few patch areas of fog are possible early on Sunday... not everyone will be affect by this, but take it easy if you run into reduced visibility tomorrow morning.
Sunday: This strong ridge that is sitting over the Southeast will continue to bring unseasonably warm temperatures and dry weather to central/south Alabama for the second half of the weekend. Another warm and dry is expected on Sunday, which is almost an exact carbon copy of our forecast from Saturday. Highs reach the mid/upper 70s by the afternoon.
MLK Day: A short wave trough will start to lift northward into the Plains in time for the holiday on Monday... this will bring an increase in mid-level moisture values across much of Alabama. There won't be much forcing to lift any moisture, so overall rain chances will remain on the low end of spectrum; we'll keep coverage around 10 percent with many spots staying dry and just seeing some extra clouds for their Monday.
Workweek Forecast: The rest of your seven-day forecast starts to show some signs of increased rain chances and slightly cooler temperatures... an unsettled southwest flow will be present in our atmosphere, so models have been hinting at showers building in coverage through midweek, which would bring us some wet weather. Highs still hang on to the low/mid 70s for many despite more clouds and some raindrops.
The latest computer model runs have shown showers and even some thunderstorms possible as a cold front slowly moving into the region by the day on Tuesday. Instability show remain weak, but wind shear will be elevated, so we will be watching for a few of the storms that develop to potential turn stronger in nature. The front looks to stall somewhere close to Interstate 20 corridor by Wednesday with elevated rain chances stick around through much of the workweek. Still a lot of details to iron out, so we will continue to fine tune the forecast and keep you updated.

Southington sent just two juniors—Amanda Howe and Megan Biscoglio—to the 72nd annual New England Interscholastic track and field championships, held at Norwell High School in Norwell, Mass. on Saturday, June 10. But the Knights welcomed back two New England medalists.
Amanda Howe came away with a regional title, and Biscoglio beat all but one in her event, as Southington track and field saved its best for last.
Howe edged Bloomfield's Brittany Jones by 2 feet, 7 inches to be crowned New England champion in the discus throw, beating out 26 athletes to take the regional title with a heave of 144 feet, 8 inches. Howe broke her own school record (139'9”) for the sixth time this season.
Howe's and Jones' throw at the regional meet were the farthest throws in the discus in New England this season. Howe finished third in the event at the regional meet last year.
“She felt that it wasn't even that great of a throw, in terms of her technique,” said Southington coach Connor Green. “But then when she heard her mark, she was smiling nonstop and was really happy. It was pretty awesome to see.”
Howe also took seventh in the shot put with a mark of 38 feet, 8.5 inches, finishing sixth in Connecticut in the event. She finished ninth in the event at the regional meet last year.
“She had a really great throw,” said Green. “She was super excited after she threw it because she knew that she would definitely be top eight that way. That just kind of propelled her into the discus.”
Biscoglio finished as runner-up to Greenwich's Lia Zavattaro (11'9”) in the pole vault with a height of 11 feet, 9 inches. First place was decided on prior jumps. Both athletes missed clearing a height of 12 feet, 3 inches, but Zavattaro beat out Biscoglio to clear 11 feet, 9 inches on her second jump.
Biscoglio cleared that mark on her third jump.
“I know that Megan was extremely excited to win the state open,” said Green. “But when it came time for the New England meet, she knew that it could have been any girls' day. There were a lot of really good jumpers in there that are capable of achieving at that level.”
Although Biscoglio finished as runner-up, it's still quite an accomplishment looking at the progress she's made in just a year's time. She finished 10th in the event at last year's Class LL championship.
“She did what she needed to do,” said Green. “She stayed hydrated and focused. She's going to get there, and wants to get there for the national meet. It really just came down to someone clearing it before she did.”
CT State Open
JUNE 5—Earlier in the week on Monday, Howe and Biscoglio advanced to the regional championship with their state open performances at Willow Brook Park in New Britain.
Howe won the open title in the discus throw, surpassing Jones (132'1”) by over seven and a half feet with a distance of 139 feet, 9 inches. Howe also placed sixth out of 25 athletes in the shot put with a throw of 36 feet, 1.5 inches.
Biscoglio was also an open champion after edging Zavattaro (11'6”) by six inches in the pole vault with a height of 12 feet, matching that school record for the second time this season.
As the only Southington male competing in the meet, Zachary Burleigh took 10th out of 22 athletes in the pole vault with a height of 13 feet. Burleigh matched his season-high mark of 13 for the third time this year.
In the team standings, the Lady Knights tied for eighth with Fairfield Ludlowe with 23 points out of 70 teams. The Blue Knights did not place.
Bloomfield (84) won their second-straight and seventh overall CIAC girls open title. Danbury (52) finished as runner-up. Daniel Hand (32) won their first-ever CIAC boys open title by a pair of points over Danbury (30).
The following 26 athletes will represent Southington in the outdoor track multi-event championships at Willow Brook Park from Tuesday, June 13 to Wednesday, June 14.
The following Lady Knights will compete in the girls 2000m steeplechase: Laini Pizzitola, Amanda Perkowski, Isabella Scalise, Fanny Moquete Trinidad, Catherine Myers, Kailey Schmarr, Anny Moquete Volquez, Natalia Adamczyk, and Kate Kemnitz.
The following Blue Knights will compete in the boys 2000m steeplechase: Matthew Penna, Jacob Mohr, Tanner Sperry, Ryan Slesinski, Matthew Maciejewski, Shane Leone, Jordan McMeans, Sean Young, Jeffrey Hannigan, Michael Dorsey, Conner Leone, Benjamin Hoffman, and Ryan Asido.
“The kids love the steeplechase,” said Southington coach Dan Dachelet. “It gives them a center stage as a distance runner in a unique event, and they look forward to training for it. It's a collegial atmosphere, and the kids take pride in doing the steeplechase every year.”
Howe, Julia Groll, and Trinity Cardillo will compete in the girls hammer throw, and Cameron Clynes will compete in the boys decathlon.
Howe and Biscoglio will also make the trip down to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensborough, NC for the National Scholastic Athletics Foundation's New Balance Nationals Outdoor competition this weekend, which will be held at from Friday, June 16 to Sunday, June 18.
Howe will be competing in the emerging elite and championship for the discus and hammer throw. Biscoglio will be competing in the emerging elite for the pole vault. Southington will also be sending down a boys and girls 800m sprint medley, and a girl 1600m sprint medley, to compete alongside with Howe and Biscoglio.

PITTSFORD, N.Y. -- In essentially swapping Sammy Watkins for Jordan Matthews as part of Friday's trades, the Buffalo Bills dealt away one of the game's more talented receivers and acquired a more reliable and durable target -- or so they thought.
Matthews suffered a chip fracture in his sternum early in Sunday's practice, his first with the team. He is considered week-to-week, which would seemingly put his availability for the remainder of the preseason in doubt.
With fantasy draft season upon us, what should players expect from Matthews and the rest of Bills' receivers? Here are some thoughts on a position group that has seen considerable change in recent weeks:
Since entering the league in 2014 Jordan Matthews has 225 catches, 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns. Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports
Matthews: One of the appeals in the Bills trading for Matthews was that he would have a better chance of staying healthy than Watkins, who has missed 11 games the past two seasons and been hampered by injuries in others. Since entering the league, Matthews has only missed two games -- both last season. As a result, his production (225 catches, 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns) has been higher than Watkins' (153 catches, 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns). However, Matthews' sternum injury will impact how quickly he adapts to the Bills' offensive scheme and develops chemistry with quarterback Tyrod Taylor. Even if Matthews returns healthy for Week 1, it is hard to see him playing a full-fledged role without the benefit of an offseason, training camp and preseason of work with the team.
There is also the issue of passing volume in the Bills' offense. Matthews caught 73 passes last season in an Eagles offense that averaged 38.1 pass attempts per game, sixth-most in the NFL. The Bills last season averaged 29.6 attempts, the fewest in the NFL. Offensive coordinator Rick Dennison, while he did not call the plays, averaged 35.6 pass attempts last season with the Denver Broncos, the 17th-most in the NFL. If Matthews had 73 catches in a higher-volume offense in Philadelphia, that number might go down in more of a run-based attack in Buffalo.

Anquan Boldin: After signing Aug. 7, Boldin is now taking a lead role among Bills receivers. He was targeted by Tyrod Taylor on five of his first six passes in 11-on-11 work Monday. Boldin did not play in the Bills' preseason opener last Thursday night, so he has yet to see live game action with Taylor. Boldin, who turns 37 in October, needs his body to hold up, but the current signs are that he could be one of Taylor's more popular targets to begin the season.
Zay Jones: The rookie second-round pick has taken a large chunk of first-team reps since the beginning of camp. That number increased Monday after Matthews was sidelined with his injury. Like most young players, Jones has met some bumps in the road, such as a third-down pass in Monday's practice in which he allowed a Taylor pass, thrown slightly high, to sail through his hands. But on average, the arrow seems to be pointing up. Watkins' departure and Matthews' injury will only help Jones get a chance to develop chemistry with Taylor in practice. He is more of a wild card than Boldin, but Jones has the upside to become the Bills' top receiver by season's end.
Andre Holmes: He has consistently been a part of the top group of receivers since the start of camp. The 6-foot-4 wideout made the play of Monday's practice when he extended to catch a third-down Taylor pass and save the drill for the first-team offense. On other days, Holmes' hands and aggressiveness to fight defensive backs for balls has been suspect. Curiously, neither coach Sean McDermott nor general manager Brandon Beane mentioned Holmes when discussing the position after Friday's trades. When Beane was asked about potential deep threats, he mentioned Rod Streater and Walter Powell -- who is suspended for the first four games of the season -- but not Holmes. Potential fantasy owners should proceed with caution.
Streater: One of the Bills' later offseason signings, Streater gained some momentum at the start of training camp and began receiving some first-team reps last week. His push to find a role seems to have lost some steam over the past several days. He received second-team reps in Monday's practice and dropped a pass over the middle at one point. He is not assured a roster spot and should not register on the fantasy radar for now.
Have your say
There will be a few sore heads in Peterborough this morning after England reached the World Cup quarter finals last night.
England took the lead in the second half thanks to a Harry Kane penalty before Yerry Mina equalised with a last-minute header.
England fans at the XL Arena celebrate as England win on penalties
After a cagey 30 minutes of extra time, England fans would have been fearing the worst as the match headed for penalties.
England were staring a premature World Cup exit in the face after Jordan Henderson missed England's third penalty but Mateus Uribe hit the bar to give Gareth Southgate's men a reprieve.
When Jordan Pickford pulled off a spectacular save from Carlos Bacca it all came down to Eric Dier to seal England's first ever World Cup penalty shoot-out win.
Video footage from the XL Arena in Peterborough shows a packed crowd watching nervously as he stepped up.
The crowd then erupts in celebrations as beer flies across the room and streamers descend.
Last week there were similar scenes in the Peterborough bar as England fans celebrated Harry Kane's penalty against Panama and his last minute goal against Tunisia.
The XL Arena will, of course, be showing the England vs Sweden this Saturday.
The party starts from 1pm and there's plenty of pre-and post match entertainment with ‘The Guards' performing live from 1.30pm plus Heart FM's very own Kev Lawrenceand resident DJ Alessandro Vacca.
Tickets are on sale now online from www.worldcup18.co.uk or from the Solstice during opening hours priced at just £5 each (over 18's only).
Tickets are first come first served.
Parkland Commission Begins Investigation Surrounding Deadly Florida Shooting A commission appointed to investigate the events leading up to and the response to the shooting in Parkland, Fla., began work Tuesday. Among the first areas of focus was the lack of coordination between law enforcement, which hampered their response to the shootings.
Gomes caps Indians comeback
Yan Gomes's hit in the bottom of the 13th inning gave the Indians a 9-8 win in a game in which they trailed, 8-3, entering the bottom of the sixth inning. Prior to this game, there had been 515 postseason games in major-league history in which one team had a lead of five-or-more runs, and the team with the large lead won 499 of those 515 games (97 percent). The Yankees entered Game 2 with a 76-3 record in postseason games in which they led by at least five runs at any time, while the Indians had been 0-20 all-time in postseason games in which they trailed by at least five runs.
Bronx Bombers hit three homers with runners on base
Gary Sanchez (2-run homer), Aaron Hicks (three-runner) and Greg Bird (two-runner) all homered with at least one man on base for the Yankees on Friday night. That matched the Yankees' franchise record for most homers with runners on base in a postseason game. The Bronx Bombers did that five times previously, the last being in Game 3 of the 2004 ALCS at Fenway Park. The Yankees who homered with runners on base in that game were Hideki Matsui, who hit two, and Gary Sheffield. The Yankees took a three-games-to-none lead in the series with a win in that game, but fell victim to David Ortiz, Johnny Damon and a bloody sock, losing the series in seven games.
Two dominant wins for Astros
The Astros took a two-games-to-none lead in the ALDS series against the Red Sox with a dominant 8-2 win after winning Game 1 of the series by the same score. Houston is the third team in major-league history to win each of the first two games of a postseason series by six or more runs. The Yankees won the first two games of the 1937 World Series against the Giants by identical 8-1 scores; and the Orioles beat the Mariners in the first two games of the 1997 ALDS by identical scores of 9-3. The Yankees won the 1937 Fall Classic in five games while the Orioles won the 1997 ALDS in four games.
Correa's first-inning home run
Carlos Correa hit a two-run home run in the first inning to give the Astros a 2-0 lead in Game 2 of the ALDS against the Red Sox. Correa is the third player in major league history to hit a home run as a shortstop while batting in the fourth spot in the batting order in a postseason game. Nomar Garciaparra did it seven times for the Red Sox in 1998 and 1999; and Didi Gregorius did it for the Yankees in this year's American League Wild Card game.
Rendon's boot is costly
Anthony Rendon's error in the sixth inning led to two unearned runs in the Cubs' Game 1 win over the Nationals on Friday night. Rendon did not commit an error in his last 56 regular-season games at third base, finishing the 2017 season with the majors' longest errorless streak at that position.
Two no-hit bids in the 2017 postseason
Stephen Strasburg took a no-hitter through 5⅔ innings against the Cubs in Game 1 of their series the night after Trevor Bauer took a no-no through 5⅓ against the Yankees in Game 1 of that series. This is the first time in postseason history that two different pitchers took a no-hitter through at least five innings in a series opener in the same season.
Hendricks and “Three Finger”
Kyle Hendricks did not allow a run in seven innings as the Cubs took Game 1 of their NLDS series against the Nationals. It was the second time in his career that Hendricks threw seven scoreless innings in a postseason game. He threw 7⅓ innings without allowing a run in Game 6 of the 2016 NLCS against the Dodgers. Only one other pitcher in Cubs history pitched two postseason games in which he threw at least seven innings without allowing a run. Mordecai “Three Finger” Brown had three such games, one in each of the World Series in 1906, 1907 and 1908.
Dodgers jump on Diamondbacks
Justin Turner hit a three-run homer and Yasiel Puig a run-scoring double in the Dodgers' four-run first-inning. That's the most runs the Dodgers have ever scored in the first inning of the first game of any postseason series. The last team to score four or more runs in the opening frame of Game 1 of a postseason series was the White Sox against the Red Sox in the 2005 ALDS. The White Sox scored five first-inning runs in Game 1 of that series, and went on to capture their first World Series championship in 88 years.
Jackets open season on a high note
Sergei Bobrovsky made 29 saves and five different players scored goals as the Blue Jackets produced the biggest season-opening victory in franchise history with a 5–0 win over the Islanders. Prior to this season, the team's largest margin of victory in an opener had been by a 4–0 score against the Ducks to start the 2007–08 campaign. That was also the only previous shutout in a season opener for Columbus, with Pascal Leclaire in net for the Blue Jackets.
Two Jackets notch first NHL goal
Sonny Milano opened the scoring for Columbus just 67 seconds after the opening faceoff with his first NHL goal, and Pierre-Luc Dubois, making his NHL debut, got his first tally when he scored the final goal for the Blue Jackets. It was just the third time in team history that two Columbus players scored the first goals of their NHL career in the same game. The previous two pairs were Ryan Johansen and John Moore on Oct. 25, 2011 (vs. Detroit) and Tomas Kubalik and Ryan Russell on Jan. 13, 2012 (vs. Phoenix).
Point records three points
Brayden Point produced a goal and two assists, tying his career high for points in one game, to lead the Lightning to a 5–3 win in its season opener against the Panthers. His only other three-point night in the NHL came in Tampa Bay's final game last season, a 4–2 victory over the Sabres in which Point scored two goals and assisted on one. That game in April capped a late-season hot streak for Point. He scored only nine goals in his first 53 games last season but then tallied nine times in his final 15 games, tying Nikita Kucherov for the Lightning team high over that stretch (March 13–April 9).
Fleury and Neal lead Golden Knights to win
Marc-Andre Fleury made 45 saves and James Neal scored both goals to lead the NHL's newest team, the Vegas Golden Knights, to a 2–1 win at Dallas in the first game in franchise history. Fleury's 45 saves were the second-most by a goaltender in the first regular-season game for a team entering the NHL since 1967–68, behind the 48 saves made by Jeff Hackett in the Sharks' debut, a 4–3 loss at Vancouver in October 1991. Neal is the seventh player since 1967–68 to score more than one goal for a team playing its first game in the NHL. The others: Bill Hicke (1967–68 Seals, two goals), Brian Kilrea (1967–68 Kings, two goals), Real Cloutier (1979–80 Nordiques, three goals), Pat McLeod (1991–92 Sharks, two goals), Chris Kontos (1992–93 Lightning, four goals) and Doug Smail (1992–93 Senators, two goals).
Craig Campbell and his daughter cover the theme song “I Don't Want To Live Forever” from the movie “Fifty Shades Darker” by Zayne and Taylor Swift and they rock it! Enjoy 🙂

“Uranus smells like rotten eggs!”
Oh, snap! That earthy image really mars our picture of it. Wonder what it Saturn? (Insert your own bad Uranus jokes and puns here.)
Finished? That giggling sound you hear is astronomers around the world enjoying their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make an announcement, tell a joke and school the masses on the correct pronunciation of the seventh planet from the Sun (it's UR-unus.)
“If an unfortunate human were ever to descend through Uranus' clouds, they would be met with very unpleasant and odoriferous conditions.”
“Very unpleasant and odoriferous conditions” is the scientific term for “farts” in a new study co-authored authored by astronomer Patrick Irwin of England's Oxford University. Published this week in Nature Astronomy, the study explains how Irwin and his colleagues used the Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer (NIFS – which can be rearranged to spell ‘snif') on the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii to ‘snif' what Uranus is cooking. And what it's cooking is rotten eggs and worse, according to the readings.
“We've strongly suspected that hydrogen sulphide gas was influencing the millimetre spectrum of Uranus for some time, but we were unable to attribute the absorption needed to it uniquely. Now, that part of the puzzle is falling into place as well.”
Study co-author Glenn Orton of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory identified the smelly culprit — hydrogen sulfide, the odiferous compound that gives its rotten egg aroma to crude petroleum, natural gas, volcanoes, hot springs, cold springs, well water, bad breath and more. It's enough that actual rotten eggs should sue for defamation of character.
Which brings us to the question … are there rotten eggs on Uranus and if so, how did they get there? (Can we blame the Klingons?)
“During our Solar System's formation the balance between nitrogen and sulphur was determined by the temperature and location of planet's formation. This tells you the gas giants and the ice giants formed in a slightly different way. They had access to different reservoirs of material back in the forming days of the solar system.”
Co-author Dr. Leigh Fletcher of the University of Leicester's Department of Physics and Astronomy explains in a press release why the gas giants – Jupiter and Saturn – can hide whatever hydrogen sulfide they might have under thick clouds of ammonia gas, while the ice giants – Uranus and Neptune (which also has hydrogen sulfide) — show signatures of it in their upper cloud decks, which were suspected but not detected until the arrival of the big sniffer – the Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer.
What does this discovery mean for future probes to Uranus? Irwin explains the bad news/good news.
“If an unfortunate human were ever to descend through Uranus's clouds, they would be met with very unpleasant and odiferous conditions.”
Here's the good news.
“Suffocation and exposure in the negative 200 degrees Celsius atmosphere made of mostly hydrogen, helium, and methane would take its toll long before the smell.”
Perhaps the best approach is to send up a sign in a universal language – cuneiform perhaps – and plant it on one or all of the planet's 27 moons with an arrow pointing to Uranus and a message reading:
LANSING, Mich. (AP)  Organizers of a ballot drive to make the Michigan Legislature a part-time body and slash lawmakers pay said they have mailed hundreds of thousands of petitions to voters in the hopes they will gather signatures from their friends and family.
The Clean Michigan committee announced the plan Monday, in conjunction with radio and online ads urging people to sign the petition. The group needs roughly 315,000 valid signatures within a 180-day window to get the constitutional amendment on the November 2018 ballot. (Continued below)

PAT CAPUTO: Lions and coach still have issues despite win.
Spokesman John Yob said the committee is two-thirds of the way toward its goal and is on track to submit the petitions to the state by the mid-January deadline. The ballot committee has also been using paid circulators and volunteers to collect signatures since July.
We are putting this decision directly in the hands of voters by mailing hundreds of thousands of petitions across the state so they can decide if they want to put the issue on the ballot and give voters the option of making this important change like most other states, Tom McMillin, a Republican member of the State Board of Education and a former legislator, said in a statement.
The constitutional amendment would require lawmakers to adjourn their regular session by April 15 of each year, slashing their pay from nearly $72,000 to half the average teachers salary, which is roughly $64,000. Although the measure would tie legislator pay to teacher pay, it would have no effect on how much teachers earn or benefit them in any discernable way.
Until last month, the ballot initiative was being spearheaded by Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, who handed off leadership of the effort to McMillin, former Republican National Committeeman Dave Agema and grassroots activists before launching a run for governor.
As of October, the group had raised $887,000, spent $733,000 and had $154,000 on hand. Nearly all of its money came from three sources: the Fund for Michigan Jobs, a 501(c)(4) social welfare nonprofit that is not required to disclose its donors ($666,000); Capital Sales Co., a Hazel Park-based distributor of snacks, tobacco and other items to convenience stores and other businesses; and Kalamazoo-area businessman William Parfet.
The group also received $301,000 of in-kind media and advertising support from a Calley-connected independent political action committee.
The proposal is opposed by the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, which says it would dramatically weaken the legislative branch in favor of the executive branch and further empower non-elected state bureaucrats.
Michigan, where legislators can serve no more than 14 years, is among 10 states with a full-time legislature, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Sixteen states have a part-time legislature, and 24 are hybrids  with lawmakers who typically say they spend more than two-thirds of a full-time job being lawmakers.

Bloody burglar nabbed at 3 a.m. heist
Posted on August 14, 2017 by Sonoma Valley Sun
Deputies from the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office arrested a 21-year-old Sonoma man after he allegedly broke into a Springs gas station at 3 a.m. Friday and dragged the cash register outside, leaving a trail of blood.
Maleek Sanchez was arrested for felony burglar.
The manager of Bonneau's 76 Gas Station, on Arnold and Grove Street in Boyes Hot Springs, had been monitoring the store's video surveillance from home.
An alarm was triggered when the suspect threw a large cinder block through the window. After pulling one cash register out, he reentered the store. Deputies arrived before he could make off with a second cash register.
Sanchez jumped back out through the shattered window and ran about 30' before surrendering. Deputies took him into custody without incident.
Sanchez was bleeding from small cuts on his hand and chin, according to the Sherrif's report. A trail of blood led them to the cash register propped against a neaby fence, near what they said was Sanchez' bike. Blood was also smeared on the cash register.
Sanchez was booked for felony burglary and has since been released after posting a $10,000 bail bond.
A tow truck driver who removed a womans vehicle from a crash scene is facing two felony charges after he allegedly stole the comatose womans bank card from her purse and made charges on her checking account.
The accident occurred May 13, 2017. She died May 18, 2017 of her injuries suffered in the single car crash, in which she was ejected.
Joel Leys, 31, of Belleville, was arrested and arraigned April 19 on two counts of illegal use of a credit card.
The charges stem from a April 13 rollover crash on northbound I-275 and W. Huron River Drive in Romulus involving a woman from Erie, Pa. She was not identified by police.

According to Michigan State Police, the woman was transported to U of M Hospital in Ann Arbor, where she remained in a coma before she died May 18, 2017.
A warrant request was submitted to the Wayne County Prosecutors Office Aug. 20, 2017.
It was the womans family who noticed someone was draining their dead loved ones checking account.
The trooper who was involved in the investigation of the crash was sent a list of unauthorized transactions.
Police began tracking the purchases and noticed one in particular was from a pizza shop not far from the tow yard that was called to remove the womans car from the crash scene.
The trooper contacted the pizza shop and discovered the delivery was to an address nearby. A check of the address showed that an employee of the tow company resided there.
The phone number used to make the pizza order was traced directly to the suspect, police said.
Officers then determined Leys took the womans bank card, which was inside her purse at the time of the crash.
The investigating trooper arrested Leys without incident.
Psyonix's “Rocket League” turns three next week and the developer is celebrating with a two-week anniversary event.
This year's festivities will be a little different than previous anniversary events, Psyonix said. Starting July 9, players can hop into the all-new 3v3 Anniversary Playlist, which features a throwback stadium inspired by Psyonix's 2008 vehicular soccer game “Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars.”
“The goal layout, in particular, is a departure from the modern goal positions seen in the rest of ‘Rocket League's' arenas, but it does harken back to the old-school days of ‘Battle-Cars,' which should tickle the old nostalgia feels quite nicely,” the developer said on its official website Tuesday.
Psyonix is also changing how players earn customization items during the anniversary event. It's doing away with the usual loot crates. Instead, players can earn “SARPBC” anniversary-themed balloons during matches, which can be redeemed for the new items. They can also be traded in for a new type of anniversary “surprise.”
“These ‘Golden Eggs' do not require a Key or Decryptor to unlock, so just crack up to ten of ‘em open to find one of over 60 possible customization items from our retired Champions Series Crates,” Psyonix said.
The anniversary event ends Monday, July 23 at 5 p.m. PDT. The balloons expire at the same time. There won't be a grace period to redeem them after the event, Psyonix said.
“Rocket League” launched in July 2015 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. A Nintendo Switch version came out in November 2017. It reportedly reached 40 million players worldwide earlier this year.
PanARMENIAN.Net - A British woman has reportedly been killed while fighting with the Kurdish forces in Syria's Afrin as the Turkish military entirely seized the city, Al-Masdar News says.
Anna Campbell, 26, was a member of a female Kurdish unit fighting the Turkish military and its proxies in the Kurdish region of Afrin.
According to friends, Campbell was killed during an airstrike conducted by a Turkish warplane.
According to YPJ sources, Campbell's wish to fight in Afrin was firstly rejected but she was persistent to do so. “She even dyed her hair black so she draws less attention”, the sources added.
Dubbed “Operation Olive Branch”, the Turkish Army, in collaboration with several rebel groups, launched an assault aimed at ousting the Kurdish militants from Afrin.
The President of a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan, Mr Ademola Odunade, on Friday dissolved eight years marriage between one Temitope Osunbote and her husband, Elijah, over infidelity.
Odunade held that the couple had refused to be pacified and he consequently terminated the union in the interest of peace and order.
"Temitope is awarded custody of the two children produced by the union, while Elijah is directed to pay a monthly feeding allowance of N8,000 for the upkeep of the children.
"This is in addition to being responsible for their education and other welfare needs" he said.
Earlier, Temitope, who resides at Imalefalafia area of Ibadan, had described her husband as a womaniser who had no regard for the sacredness of the marriage institution.
"My Lord, Elijah is deeply engrossed in infidelity because he brings his concubines to our matrimonial home every now then and even takes them to our matrimonial bed without any respect for me.
"Besides, Elijah often beats me at the slightest mistake. In fact, he is too troublesome and highly irresponsible.
"That is a part of what I have been facing in addition to frequently starving the children and me.
"There is no more love between Elijah and me. Please, separate us” Temitope said. In his response, Elijah, who consented to the dissolution, denied all the allegations levelled against him.
"Temitope is a thief and can also never be trusted for a moment as I have noticed that she has been sleeping with different men in my house.
"With my experience as a computer engineer, I installed a camera to monitor her activities while I am away and that monitoring device revealed her unfaithfulness to me.
"I have been paying the children"s school fees regularly till date. I no longer have any feelings for her" Elijah said.

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has told parliament he may be a NZ citizen. (AAP)
Labor frontbenchers insist their colleagues are in the clear as the citizenship of federal MPs is put under the spotlight.
Federal Labor is standing by the eligibility of its MPs to sit in parliament as it ramps up pressure on the prime minister to stand Barnaby Joyce aside while his fate is decided by the High Court.
The Turnbull Government has referred its own deputy leader to the High Court over his dual citizenship.
Under section 44 of Australia's Constitution, dual citizens are ineligible to serve in parliament.
If he were disqualified, Turnbull Government's one-seat majority in the lower house would be threatened.
The government is attempting to turn the tables on Labor by nominating five opposition MPs - including Justine Keay, Susan Lamb and Tony Zappia - it has questions about.
But senior Labor figures insist the party has rigorous vetting processes in place for candidates.
"We are entitled to be absolutely confident that we don't have a problem," frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon told ABC radio on Tuesday.
Mr Joyce broke the news himself on Monday, revealing the New Zealand High Commission had contacted him last week to advise he may be a New Zealand citizen.
"Needless to say, I was shocked to receive this information," he said.
"I've always been an Australian citizen born in Tamworth. Neither my nor my parents had any reason to believe that I may be a citizen of any other country."
"The New Zealand Government has no record of registering me as a New Zealand citizen."
Later on Monday, that suspicion was confirmed by New Zealand's Prime Minister Bill English.
"Unwittingly or not, he's a New Zealand citizen," Mr English said.
MORE NEWS Explainer: How did Section 44 land five senators in trouble over citizenship? The citizenship rule has claimed the jobs of two Greens senators and now seen a resignation from the Turnbull Government cabinet.
Question Time August 14: Turnbull speaks about Barnaby Joyce citizenship issue
New Zealand's Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne confirmed Mr Joyce had inherited his citizenship automatically by descent, on account of his Kiwi father.
"It's automatically passed on, I don't know whether he [Mr Joyce] knew or not," Mr Dunne reportedly told Radio NZ.
"He says he didn't know, he says he was under the belief his father had renounced the New Zealand citizenship.
"But the fact is it is all irrelevant - if he was eligible to receive the citizenship at the time, under our legislation he does, regardless of his subsequent circumstances," he said.
Turnbull confident Joyce will survive legal challenge
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the government was "very confident" about its legal advice that Mr Joyce would survive the High Court process.
The government has received advice from the Solicitor-General on the matter.
The High Court is already considering the cases of two resigned Greens senators - Scott Ludlam and Larissa Waters - as well as LNP Senator Matt Canavan and One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts, who are both remaining in their jobs until the cases have been heard.
Senator Ludlam was revealed as a New Zealand citizen, while Senator Waters discovered she was a Canadian citizen.
The court is considering whether Senator Canavan, who stepped down as from his frontbench post as resources minister but not from the Senate, should be disqualified because of his dual Italian citizenship.
Senator Roberts has been accused of once holding British citizenship, though he claims he renounced it before he was elected.
Labor demands Joyce stand aside
Labor is ramping up pressure on Mr Joyce to follow the lead of his Nationals colleague Senator Canavan and resign from his ministry until his eligibility case is settled.
The opposition has also seized on the prospect that Mr Joyce's dual citizenship may threaten the Turnbull Government's slim hold on the majority.
Labor's Tony Burke said, "We don't know whether this government has a deputy prime minister eligible under the Australian Constitution, and we don't even know whether we have a majority government in this country."
Mr Burke said the government should force Mr Joyce to immediately resign from cabinet.
Mr Joyce said he was so confident in his legal grounding that he would continue to serve as deputy leader until the court decides his political fate.
"Given the the strength of the legal advice the government has received, the prime minister has asked that I remain deputy prime minister and retain my ministerial duties," Mr Joyce said.
Labor pressed the government on why Senator Canavan was expected to stand aside from ministerial duties, but the same did not apply to Mr Joyce.
"It's up to Matt Canavan, and I guess up to Barnaby Joyce, to explain what the distinction is between his case and Senator Canavan's case," Labor MP Anthony Albanese said.
Mr Turnbull has written to Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, offering Labor the "opportunity" to refer any of its own MPs or senators.
But Labor has again reasserted its confidence that every Labor member was properly elected.
New Zealand lawyers say Joyce's consent not required
Several New Zealand lawyers specialising in citizenship law told SBS World News that Mr Joyce would not need to sign a form or register for New Zealand citizenship to receive his rights through descent.
"It's very possible that Barnaby became a citizen, even though he never knew anything about it and has never registered or had a passport or anything like that," according to Anna Hood, an international law expert at the University of Auckland.
Migration lawyer Jack Cheng at the Queen City Law firm, also in Auckland, agreed that Mr Joyce would not need to consciously agree to become a citizen.
PANAJI: The all-important, taluka-level survey to determine the number of liquor shops affected by the Supreme Court order will commence from Wednesday, said the core committee set up for monitoring the implementation of the apex court order.
With time running out, the survey work will be completed in a week's time, by February 20, said the committee, which had its meeting on Tuesday morning.
Earlier, on February 9, the core committee headed by excise commissioner, had decided that the taluka-level teams through a statewide survey will physically verify the location of each liquor shop, bar and restaurant from the highways.
In its second meeting on Tuesday, it was decided to start the survey work from February 15 and identify the liquor licences for outlets, which are within the 500-metre radius of national and state highways. The survey findings are scheduled for February 20, as per the decision of the committee.
Each eight-member, taluka-level team is headed by mamlatdar, while its other members are from the department of excise, land survey, PWD, panchayat secretary, talathi, police and circle inspector. The survey is expected to be conducted simultaneously in all talukas to expedite the work.
Although the apex court order, directing closure of liquor outlets within 500-metre radius of highways came way back on December 15, 2016, work on it could not be carried out because of the state assembly election that ended on February 4 and the model code of conduct.
“The apex court order is going to be implemented ‘in letter and spirit,'” said Menino D'Souza, excise commissioner, recently. Tentative estimates are that about 2,000 liquor outlets will have to be shut down out of 11,000 currently in existence in the state. The impact on tourism and local economy is expected to be significant, said D'Souza.
The government plans to appeal against the apex court order but first it has to find out the number of shops that are going to be adversely affected. The survey is expected to come out with the actual numbers.
Expressing concern over 1.5 lakh road accident deaths occurring annually, the apex court has ordered that all liquor vends along national and state highways will have to be closed down and all hoardings pulled down. The bench clarified that no liquor licence can be renewed after April 1, 2017.
SO often I see people getting away with small lies; it might be cheating in a friendly game, or crossing a red signal: We bribed for our ration card, bribed the cop after he caught us crossing the red signal, hush moneyed school admissions, hoodwinked examiners: Small misdeeds right? Nothing to worry about compared to the big ones others do, right?
Two men once visited a holy man to ask his advice. “We have done wrong actions,” they said “and our consciences are troubled. Can you tell us what we must do so that we may be forgiven and feel clear of our guilt?” “Tell me of your wrong doings, my sons,” said the old man. The first man said, “I have committed a great and grievous sin sire.” “What about you?” the holy man asked the second. “Oh,” said he, “I have done quite a number of wrong things, but they are all quite small, and not at all important.”
The holy man considered for a while. “This is what you must do,” he said at last. “Each of you must go and bring me a stone for each of your misdeeds.”
Off went the men and presently the first came back staggering with an enormous boulder, so heavy that he could hardly lift it, and with a groan he let it fall at the feet of the holy man. Then along came the second, cheerfully carrying a bag of small pebbles. This he also laid at the feet of the saint. “Now,” said the holy man, “take all those stones and put them back where you found them.”
The first man shouldered his rock again, and staggered back to the place from which he had brought it. But the second man could only remember where a few of his pebbles had lain. After some time, he came back, and said that the task was too difficult. “You must know, my son,” said the old man, “that bad deeds are like these little stones. If a man has committed a great sin, it lies like a heavy stone on his conscience. But if a man is constantly doing small things that are wrong, he soon forgets what they are, and does not feel any load of guilt; so he is not sorry, and soon they will stop troubling his conscience.
So, you see, my son, it is as important to avoid little sins as much as big ones.” Its time to look inward at all the small deeds we are overlooking that are finally made us hang our heads in shame shouldn't we?

A Thai provincial governor says all 12 boys and their coach have been found alive in the cave

Their skinny faces illuminated by a flashlight, the Thai soccer teammates stranded more than a week in a partly flooded cave said they were healthy on a video released Wednesday, as heavy rains forecast for later this week could complicate plans to safely extract them.
The 12 boys and their coach are seen sitting with Thai navy SEALs in the dark cave. The boys, many wrapped in foil warming blankets, take turns introducing themselves, folding their hands together in a traditional greeting and saying their names and that they are healthy.
The video lasting about a minute was recorded sometime Tuesday and was posted on the navy SEAL Facebook page Wednesday morning. The navy later released two more videos of the boys.
The boys, aged 11-16, and their 25-year-old coach disappeared after they went exploring in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Chiang Rai province after a soccer game June 23. The teammates, who were trapped inside when heavy rains flooded the cave, were found by rescue divers late Monday night during a desperate search that drew assistance from experts around the globe.
Authorities said the boys, who had also been shown Tuesday in a video shot by the British diver who discovered them, were being looked after by seven members of the Thai navy SEALs, including medics, who were staying with them inside the cave. They were mostly in stable condition and have received high-protein drinks.
In all of the videos the boys have appeared in good spirits. In the most recent videos a navy SEAL is shown treating minor cuts on the feet and legs of the boys with antibiotic ointment. Several of the boys are seen smiling as they interact with the navy SEAL, who cracks jokes.
Seeing the boys has boosted the mood of relatives, and officials are working to install an internet cable to the cave so that parents can talk to their children.

Kian Kamluang, whose 16-year-old son Pornchai is inside, said she had thought it was a 50 per cent chance that her son would be found.
“It's like he has been given a new life,” she said, adding that she'll never let her son go into a cave or near water again.
SEAL commander Rear Adm. Arpakorn Yookongkaew said Tuesday that there was no rush to bring the group out of the cave, since they're safe where they are. The current flooding situation means the boys would have to dive, which rescue experts have said could be extremely dangerous.
While efforts to pump out floodwaters are continuing, some Thai officials have indicated that heavy rains forecast for this weekend could force them to decide the boys should swim and dive out using the same complicated route of narrow passageways through which their rescuers entered.
Chiang Rai provincial Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said Wednesday that the boys have been practicing wearing diving masks and breathing, but he doesn't believe they have attempted any practice dives.
He said it is unknown when an extraction could be attempted, but it is unlikely to be Wednesday.
“If it's risky or not safe, we will not proceed yet,” Narongsak said. “It has to be 100 per cent safe.”
Authorities said they were still exploring other options, such as scouring the mountainside for other ways into the cave and finding faster ways to pump water from the cave.
Cave rescue experts have said it could be safest to simply supply the boys where they are for now, and wait for the water to go down. That could take months, however, given that Thailand's rainy season typically lasts through October.
The British Cave Rescue Council, which has members taking part in the operation , said in a statement that “although water levels have dropped, the diving conditions remain difficult and any attempt to dive the boys and their coach out will not be taken lightly because there are significant technical challenges and risks considering.”
Gary Mitchell, the group's assistant vice chairman, said getting out of the cave requires about a kilometre (half a mile) of diving total, though not all in one stretch, and takes about three hours.
“There's air pockets along the way,” he said. “It's confined spaces. It's almost zero visibility. There are currents to battle against in places as well. So it's a really quite a strenuous environment to be in,” he said.

Many payday lenders could go out of business if rules made final this week by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau go into effect. But the changes face stiff headwinds from Republicans in Congress.
One new rule would require payday and auto title lenders to determine whether a borrower can afford to repay in full within 30 days. That could thwart a business model that consumer advocates say relies on the rollover of unpaid loans with the accumulation of exorbitant fees and interest rates of 300 percent or more.
The proposed regulations also would limit the number of times a lender can debit a borrower's account without being reauthorized to do so. As The Associated Press writes, "This is because many payday loan borrowers end up over-drafting their bank accounts, which in turn incurs fees" or forces them to close their accounts.
"Too often, borrowers who need quick cash end up trapped in loans they can't afford," CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement. "The rule's common-sense ability-to-repay protections prevent lenders from succeeding by setting up borrowers to fail."
Investopedia writes:
"Payday lenders offer short-term cash loans in exchange for a postdated check, usually dated for your next payday. The amount of the check includes the loan total and a finance charge. For example, you write a check for, say, $115 to receive a $100 loan. Given a two-week loan term, which is fairly standard, the $15 finance charge works out to an APR of nearly 400%, and this assumes you pay back the loan on time."
But a 2014 study by the CFPB found that the vast majority of payday loans are not paid back on time: More than 80 percent are rolled over or followed by another loan within two weeks. The study found that 15 percent of new loans "are followed by a loan sequence at least 10 loans long."
"Payday and car title lenders profit from repeatedly dragging hard-pressed people deeper and deeper into debt, and taking advantage of families when they are financially vulnerable," said Lisa Donner with Americans for Financial Reform. "Curbing the ability to push loans that borrowers clearly cannot repay is a key protection."
However, the Financial Services Association of America, a trade group that represents the $39 billion industry, says the rule would devastate an industry that serves 30 million to 40 million customers a year.
"Taking away their access to this line of credit means many more Americans will be left with no choice but to turn to the unregulated loan industry, overseas and elsewhere, while others will simply bounce checks and suffer under the burden of greater debt," says Ed D'Alessio, the group's executive director.
The CFPB estimates that loan volume for the industry could be cut in half and that many of the 16,000 payday lender stores in 35 states will be forced out of business. Fifteen states have effectively banned such lenders.
Along with finalizing the proposed CFPB rule, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Thursday lifted restrictions that kept banks from making small-dollar loans, Reuters reports.
The payday rule would not go into effect until 2019 and still could be rolled back by Congress.
The CFPB, created under the Obama-era Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, has been in the cross-hairs of the Trump administration and Republicans lawmakers who say it saddles businesses with excessive red tape.
In February, Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., introduced a bill to cut funding to the CFPB. In June, House Republicans voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill pushed by Texas GOP Rep. Jeb Hensarling to weaken the bureau and roll back the Dodd-Frank act.
According to an opinion poll published in April by the Pew Charitable Trusts, 70 percent of 1,205 American adults surveyed want more regulation of payday lenders.
Pittsburgh band Wreck Loose write big, bombastic garage rock songs, heavy on piano, multi-part harmonies, and wry personal observations. On their debut full-length album OK, Wreck Loose, they combine the sonic aesthetics of the best of classic rock radio with confessional, often humorous lyrics, to an effect that lands the band somewhere between Elton John and early Drive-By Truckers.
Standout tracks include the cinematic opener “Long Time Listener, First Time Caller,” which soars beneath lines like “I'm praying that the next song saves my life,” and “The Day Before the Day of the Dead,” a melodic slow-groover with one of the better titles we've come across in a while.
“OK, Wreck Loose is an album about people that are in your life for just a short while,” frontman Max Somerville explains. “It could be the girl you fall in love with for a week, or the tortured artist whose biography you read on the plane. Their time with you is brief and powerful, but you never get enough. So you fill in the holes with fantasies, doubts, and things you already know to be true. You write songs about them. You write yourself into those songs and somehow you're with them forever now. The people you spend every day with, the people you love, they shape the way you talk, or laugh, or eat breakfast. But those brief encounters keep you dreaming about the life that's just around the corner.”
Listen to OK, Wreck Loose in its entirety before its June 16 release date below.
On 14 June 2017 a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress who were practicing for a charity baseball game just after 7 a.m. at a park in Alexandria, Virginia. Rep. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican who is the House Majority Whip, was wounded along with a U.S. Capitol Police officer, a staffer, and a lobbyist.
Two congressmen who left the practice early told reporters they believe they encountered the gunman in the parking lot of the park, who had asked them whether Republicans or Democrats were on the field.
South Carolina Republican representative Jeff Duncan told CNBC he and Rep. Ron De Santis (R-Fla.) were headed for a meeting when the man approached them. Duncan told the station:
And as we were walking through the parking lot to our car we were approached by a gentleman who asked if the team on the field was the Republican or the Democrat team and we said, ‘the Republican team.' He said, ‘K thanks,' and there was nothing earth shattering about it. This is a park, as you heard earlier, people are walking dogs, they're exercising, this was before work. This is a city recreation area, YMCA right beside it. And for seven years that I've played Congressional baseball, we've seen a lot of the citizens of Alexandria come out to exercise. And some will stand at the fence and watch us practice.
De Santis gave Fox News a similar account, saying he thought the man's approach and questions were “a little odd.”
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has told us that they cannot confirm whether the man who approached the two lawmakers was the same person who opened fire on the players. However, the New York Times reported that the man who spoke to Duncan and De Santis was “later identified as the gunman.”
The shooter has been identified as James Hodgkinson, age 66, from Belleville, Illinois. According to an FBI statement, authorities are running a trace on two weapons, a handgun and a rifle.
Initial reports indicate Hodgkinson, who died from wounds he received during a shootout with authorities, was a supporter of Bernie Sanders, a Democratic candidate for president who challenged Hillary Clinton before she won the Democratic nomination. Hodgkinson was highly critical of Republicans and President Trump and had a history of violent encounters.
According to the Daily Beast, Hodgkinson punched his foster daughter's friend in the face with a closed fist, then fired a shot at her boyfriend. The friend, Aimee Moreland, recounted the terrifying incident:
“[Hodgkinson] fired a couple of warning shots and then hit my boyfriend with the butt of the gun,” Moreland told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. Hodgkinson was also “observed throwing” his daughter “around the bedroom,” the police report said. After the girl broke free, Hodgkinson followed and “started hitting her arms, pulling her hair, and started grabbing her off the bed.” … When Moreland tried escaping with Hodgkinson's daughter in a vehicle, Hodgkinson reached inside and “turned off the ignition,” the report said. “We were panicked and when I tried to reverse, I hit neutral instead and he opened my car door and hit me, and then came to her car door and pulled out a knife and cut her seatbelt and dragged her out,” Moreland said. “She was only 15 or 16, I think. She was so tiny.”
Charges stemming from the incident were dismissed on technicalities. Moreland said she mistakenly failed to appear on time for a court hearing.
Sanders made a statement acknowledging that Hodgkinson had volunteered on his campaign and decried the violence:
I have just been informed that the alleged shooter at the Republican baseball practice is someone who apparently volunteered on my presidential campaign. I am sickened by this despicable act. Let me be as clear as I can be: Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.
Former Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille told The Washington Post that when he went to the nearby YMCA to work out in the mornings, he often saw Hodgkinson there and realized he was “living out of his gym bag.” He described Hodgkinson as friendly and had tried to help him locate jobs. Euille told the Post that a YMCA staffer informed him Hodgkinson had been there the morning of the shooting, but left just before 7 a.m.
The hospital treating Scalise tweeted on 14 June that he was in critical condition.

After a big attendance drop in 2016, last weekend's (June 8-11) Bonnaroo has made up for lost ground with more than 65,000 fans each day in attendance, according to a source at Live Nation.
Headliners included Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Weeknd, as well as a high-profile opening slot Friday by U2 who performed their pivotal Joshua Tree album in its entirety. U2 is currently touring in support of the album's 30th anniversary and Bonnaroo was the Irish band's first-ever US festival appearance. This year's other headliners included Chance The Rapper, Lorde, Major Lazer, the xx, and Travis Scott.
The attendance rise represented a nearly 43% increase over last year when Nashville newspaper The Tennessean reported that Bonnaroo's daily attendance hit an all-time low of 45,537, a drop of 28,156 over 2015. That decline cost Live Nation Entertainment, which acquired a majority stake in the festival in 2015, and its partners, festival co-founders A.C. Entertainment and Superfly, an estimated $9 million in ticket sales.
While this year's Bonnaroo did not reach the record levels it had in 2015 when attendance reached almost 73,000 (when headliners including Billy Joel, Mumford & Sons, Deadmau5, Kendrick Lamar, Florence & the Machine, Robert Plant, and My Morning Jacket played), its resurgence was applauded by the festival organizers who were seeing increased competition in Tennessee during the event's four-day run.
CMA Fest was held about an hour north in Nashville this weekend, with performances by Luke Bryan, Dierks Bently, Kenny Rogers, and Miranda Lambert. Nashville was also host to Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals, with the Pittsburgh Penguins defeating the hometown favorite Nashville Predators to capture the cup at Bridgestone Arena, just up the street from CMA Fest at Nissan Stadium.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned Iran on Tuesday not to follow through with threats to restart its nuclear programme, as he and French President Emmanuel Macron struggled to find common ground on saving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
Meeting Macron in the Oval Office after a colourful welcome ceremony in honour of the French leader, Trump heaped scorn on the nuclear accord negotiated by his predecessor, former president Barack Obama, and aimed at stopping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
Iran has said it will ramp up its nuclear programme if the deal collapses and a senior Iranian official said on Tuesday that Tehran might quit a treaty designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons if Trump scraps the agreement.
“If they restart their nuclear programme, they will have bigger problems than they have ever had before,” Trump said.
Trump called the agreement a “terrible deal” that was “insane” and “ridiculous” because it did not deal with ballistic missiles or Iran's activities in conflicts in places like Yemen or Syria.
“We made this terrible deal but we're going to
discuss it,” he said. Under the deal, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear ambitions in return for relief from economic sanctions. Tehran says its nuclear programme is only for peaceful means.
Macron came to Washington hoping to persuade Trump to keep the United States in the Iran agreement, saying it offered the best chance to constrain Tehran, imperfect as it may be.
He told Trump the accord is part of a “broader picture” of security in region.
“On Iran, we must contextualize this subject within the challenges of the region. There is the situation in Syria, there is security in the entire region and I think, in any case, we share a common goal of avoiding an escalation and proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region. So the question is what is the best path,” Macron said.

European calls for exemptions from Trump's plan for 25 percent tariffs on steel imports are also on their agenda, as well as the U.S. president's desire to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria as soon as practicable.
Macron, whose visit will be followed by one on Friday from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has called on Trump to keep troops in Syria for the time being to ensure the defeat of Islamic State militants.
A 21-gun salute echoed across the South Lawn and a flute-playing fife and drum corps, in red-coated uniforms and tri-corner hats, marched by Trump and Macron and their wives, Melania Trump and Brigitte Macron in a welcoming ceremony on Tuesday.
In the evening, the Trumps are to host the Macrons at the first state dinner conducted by Trump since he took power.
Trump, in welcoming remarks, thanked France for joining with the United States and Britain in launching airstrikes in Syria earlier this month in response to a chemical weapons attack blamed on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
He said he and Macron had developed over the past year “a wonderful friendship” that is “a testament to the enduring friendship that binds our two nations.”
Macron, in his remarks, called for the two countries to work together against Islamist militants, on North Korea and Iran, on “free and fair trade,” and on climate change.
“It is together that we will counter the proliferation in weapons of mass destruction, whether it is in North Korea or in Iran,” Macron said.

He alluded to Trump's withdrawal last year from the Paris climate accord, saying “we do not always agree on the solution,” but stressed “the fate of our children is at stake.”
(While this may not be a viable option around for most in this area, it is an interesting idea to kick around when trying to lower input costs and equipment payments.)
Economic efficiency is paramount to profitability in crop production operations. Machinery and production equipment costs represent a major expense and one that has been on the rise in recent years. The Nebraska Farm Business Inc. calculates that in 2015, the cost of machinery on a per-acre basis was 18% of the total cost of corn production.
Proper management of these costs represents a key area where producers can effectively and efficiently reduce per acre costs of growing and harvesting crops.
Joint ownership of equipment can spread costs among multiple operators and reduce equipment costs for the individual operator. Successful joint ownership requires both a written agreement at the onset and ongoing good communication between the parties.
Machinery agreements can be structured in many ways; however, the most common include:
Sole ownership with a custom agreement – one party owns the machine, makes all payments including repairs, and makes an agreement with another producer for the use of the equipment, similar to renting equipment
Joint ownership – each party in the agreement is responsible for a portion of all payments, including principle, interest, and cash expenditures
Advantages of Shared Machinery
There are a number of advantages to sharing machinery costs, including:
Shared expense of high cost agricultural machinery
Efficient use of the machinery — equipment may be used over more acres annually than may have been possible in a single operation
Opportunity for shared labor, mechanical skills, and repair facilities
Opportunity to share technology like GPS auto guidance, grid yield data, etc.
Possible increased purchasing power in equipment selection due to combined financial resources
Opportunity for new and beginning farmers with fewer resources to partner with established producers to effectively manage risk exposure
Disadvantages of Shared Machinery
There are some disadvantages to joint ownership as well. They include:
Bottlenecks in production – both owners need equipment at the same time
Cash flow needs of one owner may not coincide with the needs of another
Machinery downtime may be detrimental to both owners, depending on field demand
Potential for death, bankruptcy, or unplanned retirement of one owner
Payment deficiency by one party requires another owner to pay more to keep equipment
Independence in ownership is lost – decisions on machine disposal must be agreed to by all parties
One owner may be harder on machinery than another, or return equipment dirty or in disrepair
Starting the Joint-Ownership Process
Communication between all potential owners in a joint machinery venture is critical to success. They'll need to complete a series of steps:
Both parties must agree on the size and capability of the intended machine. If the shared item is too small, efficiency is lost due to production bottlenecks and the higher potential for breakdowns.
Decisions must be made on brands, fuel types, and machine characteristics. This is an important step when considering the various creature comforts and technologies available on today's agricultural machinery.
The machinery agreement must be completed.
The Machinery Agreement
This is the most critical aspect of shared ownership. Following are just a few of the questions that must be answered when preparing the agreement.
What determines who uses the equipment and at what time?
Is there a maximum number of acres or hours for each owner's use?
When controversy occurs regarding use priority, who or what standard will be used to make the final decision?
How will repair/fuel/lube costs be separated?
How will the machine or item be transported from one location to another?
What are the investment requirements of each party involved?
Will one party make the payment on behalf of the others or will each party make a separate payment?
How will use or availability of the equipment be determined?
What happens in the event of a bankruptcy, an unfavorable court ruling, retirement of an owner, or the untimely death of an operator?
Failure to address these questions in the written agreement may be disastrous. Do not assume that because you are entering into a relationship with a family member or a very good friend that a shared machinery agreement is not needed.
Summary
Joint ownership of agricultural equipment offers an opportunity to spread costs over multiple entities. Overall acquisition and annual maintenance costs are applied to an operation based on mutual agreement. This enables an entity the opportunity to capture both depreciation and operating expenses on the equipment, while lowering total cash outlays. Joint ownership also allows for larger equipment purchases, which may be required, depending on the net total acreage of the combined operations.
To be effective joint ownership of equipment requires a written agreement, good record keeping of expenses, and good communication. All parties must realize that they are partners in the investment. It's important that the equipment agreement be structured such that it addresses the issues and concerns identified in this guide and any others that may occur between all involved.

America's Cup - Hanuman wins light air race to open Superyacht Regatta
Hanuman - J- Class Regatta - 35th America's Cup - Bermuda June 13, 2017 Richard Gladwell Hanuman - J- Class Regatta - 35th America's Cup - Bermuda June 13, 2017 Richard Gladwell www.photosport.co.nz
by J-Class Media today at 6:09 pmAlthough they had to return and recross the line Hanuman were able to recover as the breeze filled from the right side of the first upwind leg. Already positioned on the favoured side, they chased Velsheda around the first windward mark, capitalised when the leaders set a kite which they almost immediately had to douse and then extended away to take first gun ahead of second placed Ranger.The crew which won the six J Class yacht fleet at the Saint Barths Bucket in March win the first of the three scheduled races at the America's Cup Superyacht regatta. Optimised for the light conditions expected in Bermuda, Hanuman looked quick in the 5-9kts patchy breeze which was affected by the cloud patterns over the island to windward of the race course.
They were pushed in the final seconds pre start by Topaz, but all three boats which started closest to the committee boat, windward end of the line – Hanuman, Topaz and Velsheda – were able to climb away from the fleet as the wind swung right and strengthened slightly. Conversely Lionheart, which started to the left, struggled initially and were forced to watch as their rivals sailed away. But, just as the first windward leg proved fickle and shifty, so was the final short beat. Lionheart was able to pass Topaz for fourth and Ranger stole second of the five J Class yachts which raced today. It is understood Svea will join the regatta from Wednesday.
Round the world race winning navigator Simon Fisher is sailing as strategist on Hanuman, strengthening the afterguard of helm Ken Read and navigator Stan Honey – who was originally Fisher's counterpart on the race winning ABN Amro 1 in the 2005-6 Volvo Ocean Race when he sailed on the youth ABN Amro 2 crew. Fisher summarised the Hanuman win: 'The racing today was dominated by the clouds coming over Bermuda and that made it tricky. Despite being a little bit early, we were pushed by Topaz and ran out of room, we gybed back but were on the right side of the shift and were back into the fleet quite quickly which was good.'
'After that is been a 'soldier's course' until the final beat. It was lifting a bit on the reach and we were always trying to sail our best, fastest angles. We got our chute on for a while and that was a little gain to us. Then the next reach was under jib. The final upwind was quite interesting we were a little conservative covering the boats behind us and Ranger made a good gain on the left.'
'The weather has been changing all the time. You come here thinking we are on an island in the middle of the ocean, features should be driving the weather and it should be quite simple. But really it is anything but. The front to the north of us has been chucking down fronts at us, with rain, thunderstorms and clouds, that is messing things up.'
'Today the gradient wind was very light and so then the clouds really have a big effect on everything. They cause big wind shifts, big calms and so you had to be on the right side of them today.'

Source: Should Mawarire have come back? – DailyNews Live
Maxwell Sibanda 13 February 2017
HARARE – Zimbabweans across the divide have been debating on whether it
was wise for activist clergyman and founder of #ThisFlag movement, Evan
Mawarire to come back to the country after his six months self-exile in
the United States.
Mawarire returned to Zimbabwe on February 1 only to be arrested by State
security agents at Harare International Airport. He was released this week
on bail.
The Daily News spoke to a number of social and political commentators who
gave their views on Mawarare's unexpected return and arrest. But was it a
mistake that he decided to come back home?
Political commentator Macdonald Lewanika said Mawarire's mistake was to
leave in the first place as it postponed the inevitable, killed hope and
belief in the cause which he had been able to cultivate with a broad
spectrum of people at home and abroad in a short time.
“His initial decision allowed the arrest to take place at a time when his
support and sympathy from some elements of the public had ebbed.
“But his return knowing this, both that some people were unhappy with his
initial decision thus no longer supported him as fervently as they did
last year, and knowing that he would be incarcerated and probably lose his
right to travel on a Zimbabwe passport for a while if released, or if
convicted, shows a sternness of character and sacrifice that is admirable
on his part.
“One hopes that he can beat the charges and be released soon to begin the
work around building real relationships on the ground in Zimbabwe which
stood aborted when he decided to leave last year.”
Social activist Farai Maguwu could only agree with Lewanika: “Mawarire's
mistake was not in returning to his country, but rather the decision to
leave when the movement he had initiated had reached its peak.”
Human rights lawyer Dewa Mavhinga said: “To my knowledge there was no
warrant of arrest for Mawarire while he was away in the United States
because when he left last year he had been cleared by the courts and had
committed no crime.
“Mawarire, like all other Zimbabwean citizens, has a fundamental
constitutional right to freely travel and leave or return to his country
at will, without any fear.
“But it is unfortunate that the Zimbabwe authorities choose to use
prosecution for persecution of a citizen whose only `crime' was to speak
out against corruption and lack of accountability.
“President Mugabe's government released Mawarire on bail but must drop all
charges against him.”
Social commentator Rashweat Mukundu said: “Charges against Mawarire are
trumped-up and politically-motivated and to hide away in exile is to give
credence to these charges as well as give in to Zanu PF politics of fear.
“Mawarire is right to come back, clear his name and expose the abuses that
many face in Zimbabwe. He equally has a right to criticise the government
and pursue either civic or political activism as he pleases. Zimbabwe
belongs to all that is those who support and oppose Zanu PF.
“We must never, and I repeat, never be coerced into believing this one
party, singular narrative and ideology propagated by Zanu PF of and
enforced with fear and violence.”
MDC spokesperson Obert Gutu said: “As far as we understand, Mawarire was
not a fugitive from justice and so there is absolutely no lawful reason
why he shouldn't have returned to Zimbabwe.
“The main issue here is that the Zanu PF regime is a renegade and
terrorist outfit that is seeing enemies even where there are none.
“This regime is intolerant, violent, brutal and corrupt to the bare bones.
Mawarire should be immediately released from custody. He has got no case
to answer.”
Political commentator Vivid Gwede said: “Mawarire was clearly aware of the
treatment that potentially awaited him back here in Zimbabwe if one
followed the scenarios he gave to foreign media.
“It was not a mistake coming back; I should think so, because he probably
wanted to see an end to his self-imposed exile status. I think he wanted a
closure to the case.
“Now what is happening is moving towards that end of concluding the case,
and he stands a chance. For now he is paying the dues of reclaiming his
freedom through directly facing the legal arsenal that his enemies have
assembled.”
Protest playwright and actor Silvanos Mudzvova said Mawarire is a
Zimbabwean and he did not commit any crime, hence there was no reason why
he shouldn't return home.
“If you are a genuine fighter for the rights of people it pains to stay
out of Zimbabwe while problems continue to happen every day. Mawarire
felt the pain of letting the people who trusted him down.
“Look, he is good at social media mobilisation and all activists in this
country failed to close that gap.
The only way for social media activism to work effectively is when you are
on the ground with the people and Evan did that coming back to the people.
“Mugabe went into exile with Sally (the late President's first wife) and
they returned, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison but in the end the
war was won.
“With Mawarire back in Zimbabwe the spirit of social media activism has
been revived and Zimbabwe will become interesting again.”
Political commentator Phillip Pasirayi said: “Mawarire decided to come
back even if he knew about the impending arrest. You need leaders like
that who are prepared to go that extra mile to fight the unjust system.
“If he had prolonged his stay (in the US) many of his supporters would
have doubted his commitment to the struggle.
“I think he did the right thing to come back and be with the people.
Already some people were starting to doubt him and his return and what he
is currently going through will restore that confidence in people who
follow him.”
Political analyst Maxwell Saungweme said: “Mawarire is a Zimbabwean and he
has every right to come back home. But he had fled in the first place for
his safety then it was imprudent to come back so early without guarantees
that he will be safe.”
ZimRights director Okay Machisa said: “Coming back to your country
especially when you have started a very legal and noble case for the
country becomes paramount to the democratisation process of Zimbabwe.
Mawarire proved beyond doubt that he with us and ready to face the system
and that it's better to be in jail in Zimbabwe than outside the country
“Mawarire knew that he would be arrested and that he could be locked up
for a long time but he decided to come.
“Struggles all over have not been fought from comfort zones. He is not the
first to be arrested on such issues and therefore it becomes important for
him to be brave and follow the path of those that have gone through
such.”

Ensuring the Cybersecurity of Manufacturing Systems
Washington, DC - Cybersecurity, at this point in the technological age, has become a household word. Every week, almost like clockwork, it seems there is a story on the news about a newly discovered hack or data breach often made possible by poor cybersecurity practices. Many of these incidents are focused around stolen data, which resides in our IT, or information technology, infrastructure. However, the breaches that interest me are those that affect the systems and devices that monitor and manipulate much of the world around us and have real-world health and safety consequences if they are compromised. These extremely important systems and devices are known as operational technologies, or OT.
Typically hidden in plain sight, OT controls many of the processes we rely on every day, including traffic signals, power distribution, hydroelectric dams, water treatment, building HVAC, oil and gas distribution, nuclear power plants, and many varieties of manufacturing. Again, the most important characteristic of OT is their ability to reach out from the digital world and manipulate the physical world where we humans reside. It's not difficult to imagine some of the disasters that could occur if these critical OT processes were to be compromised because of poor cybersecurity practices.
So, how do these systems manipulate the physical world? At the most basic level, they're not much different from my coffee maker, whose proper function I rely on for my proper function every morning.
Inside the coffee maker there is a tiny computer, a series of valves and heating elements that work together to create, in my opinion, the most delicious and invigorating elixir the world has ever known. If the computer failed to manage the coffee-making process, the consequences can vary from simple disappointment, e.g., no coffee because the water was never heated, to catastrophic, e.g., the heating element stayed on all day, caught fire and burned down my house. The same is true for more elaborate OT systems, like manufacturing machines and robots, which can include thousands of sensors and actuators.
So, what's the problem with securing these devices? Well, not so long ago, OT systems were built using proprietary hardware and software and their operational details were not well known. Today, however, OT leverages many of the same technologies that were originally created for IT, e.g., networking, the internet, operating systems, user management, USB ports and web servers. Because of this shared technology, it's easy to assume that any type of cybersecurity technology could be implemented to protect OT, but this is not the case.
For example, cybersecurity devices that filter unauthorized network traffic on an IT network could cripple an OT network simply by preventing important data from reaching its destination, and, in some cases, can cause failures just by delaying data. Software used to scan a network for vulnerabilities may send unfamiliar messages to OT devices and can cause them to fail, which is especially bad if the device is actively controlling a process. Even something as simple as antivirus software can have a detrimental impact on the performance of these critical systems and may be impossible to implement altogether.
This is where our research begins. In our laboratory testbed, we install, integrate and test these cybersecurity technologies on emulated manufacturing systems. We have all the parts and pieces to reproduce manufacturing systems in the lab, including identical industrial controllers, network hardware, human-machine interfaces and even robots. The main difference between our testbed OT and the real manufacturing processes are the additional measurement devices we use to evaluate their operational characteristics.
Standards and guidelines detailing best practices for protecting IT and OT have already been produced by industry, trade groups and government agencies. However, one thing they are missing is guidance that describes how to balance those protections with potential negative impacts they may have on performance. To fill this gap, my group is working to produce guidelines, test methods, metrics and tools based on measurement science and standards to give industry the confidence it needs to effectively apply cybersecurity protections on their systems without negatively affecting their performance, safety or reliability. Our work has already resulted in a manufacturing profile for the Cybersecurity Framework, which outlines a risk-based approach to help manufacturers implement, manage and improve their cybersecurity posture using industry standards and best practices. And to put the manufacturing profile to the test, we will be using it to protect our robotic and process control testbed under many different configurations and scenarios while measuring the performance impacts to the system.
At this point, we have just begun validating our measurement systems and performed initial testing, but with all the progress we have made so far, I can only see great things coming out of our work. If you're a manufacturer, I hope our research can help you continue to keep your operations safe, reliable, performing as expected, and more secure.

FORGET shale gas, the issue we now have in Ryedale is a dreadful protest camp at Kirby Misperton which is a total eyesore (Wendy Cross, The Yorkshire Post, December 31). These transient professional campaigners are here to oppose shale gas operations.
These outliers exhibit a blatant disregard for local residents, offering no moral compass. There now has to be a protracted legal process to remove these unwelcome itinerants. The farmer can no longer use his field, he will lose income and be unable to provide food for our country.
Their immoral behaviour has caused much distress for the villagers and locals. Cars are parked dangerously on the side of the road, ugly pallet castles in the camp are being built and the field used as a toilet.
Flamingo Land boasts 1.5 million visitors per year, employing hundreds of locals. Many visitors to Flamingo Land stay in local accommodation and spend their money with local businesses.
The theme park is a major contributor to our local economy. This ugly camp is now a threat to all tourist businesses in Ryedale.
While they are busy campaigning against gas their hypocrisy knows no bounds, they use gas to cook and heat in the camp.
These professional campaigners are not welcome, not wanted and not helping us save the planet as long as they destroy our local economy and environment with their camp.
From: David Downs, Sandal, Wakefield.
IN response to Wendy Cross, I would ask if she would prefer a hundred or so wind generators and a few fields of solar panels around Beverley? I would ask her to go for a drive along our Yorkshire coast and see how the Greens have spoilt the scenery for residents and visitors, and the acres of solar panels that have changed the scenery of Cornwall.
Why didn't your supporters go up and camp on Donald Trump's golf courses when he successfully defeated the Scottish Parliament in their efforts to erect wind generators around his courses?
I would suggest that there are thousands of pensioners and low paid workers, who cannot afford to heat their homes due to the extensive levies placed on the cost of power, in subsidising inefficient green power generation. I respectfully suggest, therefore, that you send your bottles and cans to the Salvation Army where they would be put to better use.
From: Michael Farman, Willow Grove, Beverley.
I WRITE to support the letter from Wendy Cross. When North Yorkshire County Council voted in favour of Third Energy's application to frack at Kirby Misperton, I recall one councillor remarking “I don't know what all the fuss is about, it's only one well”.
The reality is very different: if this well is drilled and a substantial quantity of shale is found (as the drilling company expects), that will trigger the “dash for shale” resulting in the multiplication of wells across North, East and South Yorkshire and Lancashire. The time is now: we have a one-off opportunity for the majority who do not want this to happen to show the strength of our opposition by supporting the local people and protectors who are prepared to endure the winter conditions to oppose the drilling.
It is up to all of us to make the effort to peacefully show up in number at the site to convince the industry and the Government that there is no social licence for this dangerous industry.
From: David Pasley, Mill Lane, Pickering.
HAVE you ever noticed how opponents of shale gas and fracking demand that the industry behaves transparently and in compliance with all known rules, but then seem to think that the same standards don't apply to them and their actions?
A number of complaints have been made to the ASA about the claims against fracking circulated by opposition groups across the country; in every single case, rather than defend their claims, they have chosen to try and avoid the spotlight of damaging publicity by agreeing not to repeat them and hoping the issue goes away quietly.
Then consider what a fracking company must do in order to explore for gas – once it has identified what it thinks is a suitable location, it has to agree access rights with the legal landowner before it can move in and begin operations – anti-fracking activists, as we've seen this last week, simply turn up and take any field they like to host their protest camps.
The double standards and hypocrisy are astonishing, and used to great effect by fracking opponents in trying to persuade the public to their cause.
Hopefully, the truth and facts will soon prevail when Third Energy gets fracking and locals can see for themselves that it's not that different to the oil and gas activity seen across the Vale of Pickering for decades.
From: Eddie Thornton, Pickering.
ON the night Thirsk and Malton MP Kevin Hollinrake was elected, he invoked Gandhi when he said “Be the change you wish to see in the world”. As an admirer of Gandhi – the icon of nonviolent dissent – I hope Mr Hollinrake will therefore support the protection camp at Kirby Misperton where plans are being made for a campaign of nonviolent direct action to protect our land from fracking.
Our community has spent two years working within the system doing everything possible to prevent our countryside from being turned into a sacrifice zone for the unconventional gas industry.
There were over 4,000 objections to Third Energy's planning application. In every village we find opposition at around 90 per cent. Our district and every one of our town councils voted to oppose the industry. But still our voices are ignored. Do we need further proof of the corporate takeover of our democracy?
The system has failed us, and the people of Ryedale are left with no other option but to put our bodies between the industry and our land. And we hope others will join us. If we don't stop them here, the whole of Yorkshire will be fracked.

COLUMBUS (AP) — The Ohio Legislature “thumbed its nose” at the state Supreme Court by passing a law reducing funding for cities that operate traffic camera programs after the court previously found such programs constitutional, an attorney for the city of Toledo told the court Tuesday.
Joseph McNamara, arguing for Toledo, told justices that lawmakers were obliged to follow the Supreme Court's earlier decisions prohibiting the anti-camera laws.
By not doing so, “in essence the General Assembly thumbed its nose at the judiciary,” he said.
“How do you build a law on another law that's unconstitutional?” McNamara said.
The high court has issued four rulings backing cities that use cameras to issue tickets for speeding and red-light violations.
The new debate before the court is whether a 2015 law reducing funding for cities using the cameras is constitutional. Lower courts ruled against the funding law, determining it was an end-run around original rulings upholding the use of traffic cameras.
The judge who ruled against the funding law had proper jurisdiction, and that the ruling doesn't affect lawmakers' overall spending power, McNamara argued.
A lawyer for the state said a new lawsuit challenging the funding bill should have been filed. Instead, lower courts improperly ruled based on previous decisions against the constitutionality of traffic camera bans, said Michael Hendershot, Ohio chief deputy solicitor.
Hendershot also questioned whether lower courts followed proper procedures in making their decisions.
“The idea that a trial court can tell the assembly not to legislate is a fairly shocking proposition,” he said.
Lower court rulings against lawmakers' funding powers are also a violation of the separation of powers, the state has argued in court filings.
Several justices asked McNamara, representing Toledo, why the city didn't file a separate lawsuit over the funding law.
“There's no new lawsuit here,” said Justice Patrick DeWine. “What makes this law so special that you get to come back into court?”
McNamara said Toledo shouldn't have to file a new lawsuit since the spending law was an attempt to subvert an earlier court decision.
A ruling isn't expected for several weeks.

La Liga's India manager Jose Antonio said ATK, twice champions of the Indian Super League (ISL), should solve whatever problem they have with Atletico Madrid.
“They went from being champions with the Spanish model and (when they said) ‘we go British', they were almost last. This is not good news. Whatever problem they have with Atletico Madrid, they should solve it. I think it is a huge mistake to say ‘I don't want to know anything about Spanish football now'. It proved to be a huge mistake on the pitch. Given the characteristics of Indian players, the physical British game is not the best,” said Antonio in an exclusive interview here on Monday.
After winning the ISL twice and playing the semi-finals in all three editions, Atletico de Kolkata became ATK in the ISL 2017/18, with principal owner Sanjiv Goenka saying that the partnership with Atletico Madrid was over.
That ended the pre-season preparations in Madrid and the Kolkata team being able to draw on Atletico Madrid's vast resources in terms of coaching personnel and foreign players.
Atletico's departure also affected La Liga's bid to connect with India. “Had the relationship stayed, it would have been better for us. Theirs would have been a strong presence and it would have been a strong relationship for us… What we will have to do is try to understand what happened and avoid making the same mistake,” said Antonio.
Antonio though didn't think that ATM's absence affected ISL as a brand. Pointing out to similar arrangements by other franchises that didn't survive the first year, he said the ISL's biggest challenge is to get people to the stadium with what it offers.
The ISL needs to grow organically and you need to give it time, he said. It needs European know-how and not branding. “If we can help them, we will,” he said.
Having set up offices in India in September 2016 because it is a market for the future – unlike China which is being wooed by all top European clubs now but which Antonio said, is overspending on football – the centre-point of its strategy is to have a deeper digital footprint, he said.
“It has grown from 8 lakh to 2.5 million in one season,” he said. Content will soon be available in regional Indian languages, he said.
There are plans to bring Spanish skills to India to boys and girls in metro cities and to get a La Liga team over. But it won't be any of the big three: Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid.
“We are not looking at the big ones. Being persistent is what we need. First, a team comes, the second and then the big ones realise that India is a market they need to look at,” said Antonio. (By arrangement with HT Media)
“Lost in Space,” one of Netflix's newest high-profile original series, drew 6.3 million U.S. viewers within the first three days of its release earlier this month, according to Nielsen.
In addition, in the first 72 hours of release (April 13-15) of all 10 epsiodes, “Lost in Space” viewers on average watched the show for 2.5 hours, per Nielsen. The media-measurement firm found the series was heavily binged — with almost 1.2 million people having watched the series' final episode within those three days.
By comparison, the “Stranger Things” season 2 premiere episode average 15.8 million viewers from Oct. 27-29, while 11 million U.S. viewers who watched Netflix's “Bright” during its first three days of release, according to Nielsen.
Famously, Netflix doesn't release viewing metrics, holding such data close to its vest — leaving third parties like Nielsen to try to estimate demand. Netflix has pointed out that Nielsen's estimates cover only the U.S. and only tracks viewership on connected TVs (excluding mobile devices and computers). The Nielsen SVOD Content Ratings, launched last fall, extrapolate viewership using audio-recognition technology that “listens” to what viewers are watching on TV.
In “Lost in Space,” which Netflix has been marketing heavily, Will Robinson and the Robot form an unexpected, unbreakable bond that could mean the difference between life and death for the Robinsons.
The series stars Toby Stepehens (“Black Sails,” “Die Another Day”) as John Robinson, and Molly Parker (“House of Cards,” “Deadwood”) as Maureen Robinson, the family's parental leaders. The Robinson kids are portrayed by Taylor Russell (“Falling Skies”) as Judy, Mina Sundwall (“Maggie's Plan”) as Penny, and Max Jenkins (“Sense8,” “Betrayal”) as the curious and sensitive Will Robinson.
The series is produced by Legendary Television and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (“Dracula Untold,” “Last Witch Hunter”). Zack Estrin (“Prison Break”) serves as showrunner. The three are executive producers alongside Synthesis Entertainment's Kevin Burns and Jon Jashni with Applebox's Neil Marshall and Marc Helwig.
The original “Lost in Space,” created by Irwin Allen, aired for three seasons, from 1965 to 1968 on CBS. The original also spawned a 1998 feature film starring William Hurt, Gary Oldman, Matt LeBlanc, Heather Graham and Mimi Rogers.
Even if B.C. sweeps the club's final five games, it still might not be enough to make the post-season
There was a palpable anger in the B.C. Lions' locker-room following a last-second loss to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats two weeks ago.
Wally Buono would like to see a little more of that emotion from his team on the field.
“After the fact, it's too late. Maybe go into the game a little more angry,” said B.C.'s head coach and general manager. “Football is an emotional game played by angry men.
“The anger has to come before the game, not after the game.”
Fresh off a bye week, where all they could do was stew over the crushing 24-23 home defeat that put another major dent in their playoff hopes, the Lions (6-7) sit last in the CFL's West Division as they prepare to host the Ottawa Redblacks (5-9-1) on Saturday.
Even if B.C. sweeps the club's final five games, it still might not be enough to make the post-season with the Saskatchewan Roughriders (7-6) and Edmonton Eskimos (7-6), who sit third and fourth in the West, both holding the tiebreaker over the Lions.
“You wanna be in the playoffs? You're in the playoffs,” Buono said in describing his team's current predicament. “I've been here a million times.
“I can handle the pressure. Can you?”

The good news for B.C. is Edmonton has lost six straight after starting the season 7-0, but the success or failure of the teams ahead of the Lions in the standings won't matter if they can't figure out their own game.
“It's playoff football for us right now,” said B.C. wide receiver Bryan Burnham. ”We can't lose. We can't rely on other teams. We have to do what we can.
“Every game's a must-win from here on out.”
🚀🚀🚀 #Repost @tsn_official ・・・ Jonathon Jennings keeps airing it out, Lions' receivers keep hauling them in! 🚀 A post shared by BC Lions Football Club (@bclions_official) on Sep 22, 2017 at 10:35pm PDT
Lions quarterback Jonathon Jennings showed signs of life in the loss to Hamilton after a dismal performance against the Calgary Stampeders the previous week, but an offence that was supposed to light up the scoreboard has still yet to find its rhythm for a club that has lost two straight and five of its last six.
“It's been a tough season for all of us,” said Jennings, who has just six touchdown passes and an ugly 12 interceptions. ”It hurts to lose, especially with all the expectations we have for ourselves.
“But we know it's not over. We know our chances aren't lost.”
Wide receiver Chris Williams, who signed with B.C. following two outstanding seasons in Ottawa, said the Lions' biggest problem has been a lack of execution in key moments.
“We've just got to go out there and make plays when the opportunities are given,” said Williams. ”There's going to be some opportunities out there. We've got to sting them. We've got to make it count.”
The Redblacks, meanwhile, sit second in the East after two straight losses — including last week's 18-17 home defeat to Saskatchewan — but should have star quarterback Trevor Harris, who suffered a separated throwing shoulder on Sept. 9, under centre at B.C. Place Stadium.
Last season's Grey Cup champions, seven of the Redblacks' nine losses have been a combined 17 points in what has also been a frustrating 2017.
“You play football to play football, not to watch it or be on the (injured reserve),” Harris told reporters in Ottawa before the team flew west. “Even just missing three weeks is something that's an eye-opener.”
The Redblacks beat the Lions 31-24 in the nation's capital back on Aug. 26. The visitors trailed 31-3 in the fourth quarter before a frantic comeback attempt fell short after quarterback Travis Lulay replaced an ineffective Jennings.
But Lulay suffered a torn ACL in his right knee two weeks later, thrusting Jennings back into the starting role.
Despite his struggles, Buono said the third-year pivot still has a chance to save both his and the Lions' season.
It just has to start now.
“Athletes thrive on success,” said Buono. “When success doesn't happen, everybody's confidence starts to wane. It's what your foundation is, it's what your beliefs are, it's what your support system is that helps you to get through it.
“At the end of it you've got to pick yourself up. Nobody's going to help you.”

Universal's “The First Purge” has opened with a solid $2.5 million at 2,350 North American locations on Tuesday night.
“The First Purge,” Blumhouse's fourth installment in the horror franchise, expands to 3,031 theaters on Independence Day with forecasts for a $25 million launch in its first five days. It has a two-day head start on Disney-Marvel's “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” pegged for an impressive debut of $70 million to $80 million for Friday-Sunday with previews launching Thursday night.
Two years ago, “The Purge: Election Year” took in $3.6 million in Thursday-night previews prior to its Friday opening.
“The First Purge” is an origin story set in a dystopian America, in which the New Founding Fathers of America decide to make all crime legal for 12 hours — resulting in violence exploding across the nation. The film stars Y'lan Noel, Lex Scott Davis, Joivan Wade, Luna Lauren Velez, and Marisa Tomei.
The prequel is written and produced by James DeMonaco, who directed the first three “Purge” movies. Gerard McMurray is the helmer with Michael Bay, Andrew Form, Jason Blum, Bradley Fuller, and Sebastien Lemercier also producing.

YELLOWKNIFE (June 14, 2017) – Two airborne geophysical surveys will provide additional insight for prospectors and mineral development companies interested in exploration in the Slave Geological Province of the Northwest Territories (NWT). The studies, developed by the Northwest Territories Geological Survey (NTGS), provide detailed airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey data from the promising region.
The reports will be released on June 22, 2017 at 8:30am at: http://gateway.nwtgeoscience.ca/
The new reports are entitled:
NWT Open Report 2017-014. Aeromagnetic Survey of the Central Slave Craton, NWT, Parts of NTS 75M and 75N
Aeromagnetic Survey of the Central Slave Craton, NWT, Parts of NTS 75M and 75N NWT Open Report 2017-015. Airborne Electromagnetic and Horizontal-Gradient Magnetic Survey of the Central Slave Craton Area, NWT, Parts of NTS 75M, 75N, and 76D
This is the second data release in 2017; an earlier data set of mineral chemical information was released in March. The work was funded by a joint agreement between the NTGS and the Canadian Northern Development Agency (CanNor) to inform a variety of mineral exploration, geological and environmental research objectives.
The NTGS is a science-mandated division of the Department of Industry, Tourism and Investment. Enhancing the availability of geoscience information is central to the Government of the Northwest Territories' stated mandate to implement the NWT Mineral Development Strategy.

The Michigan State Police said it is closing a stretch of Interstate 94 to search for evidence tied to last week's shootings along the freeway.
Officials said the agency is closing westbound I-94 between Conner and Gratiot at 11 a.m. to sweep for evidence.
Motorists should expect traffic delays.
After the sweep is done there, troopers will close westbound I-96 between Livernois and the Davison.
Officials said investigators are looking for evidence from the Dec. 7th shootings and want to conduct the sweeps before snow plow trucks are on the road.
They also said there have been no additional shootings on Detroit's freeways since the Dec. 7th.
Anyone with information about the shootings should call the Michigan State Police at (313) 237-2450.

If NFL commissioner Roger Goodell will have a meeting with a group of cheerleaders, the two former cheerleaders who recently filed discrimination claims will settle those claims for $1 each.
The settlement proposal by Sara Blackwell, the lawyer representing the cheerleaders, asked that Goodell and league lawyers have a "good faith" meeting with at least four cheerleaders to create binding rules and regulations for all NFL teams. Also, teams that currently have cheerleading squads would not be allowed to disband them as retaliation for at least five years.
The proposal was sent to NFL attorney Steven Hurd on Tuesday.
Blackwell represents former New Orleans Saints cheerleader Bailey Davis and former Miami Dolphins cheerleader Kristan Ware. Blackwell asked for a response from the NFL by May 4.
Editor's Picks Ex-Miami cheerleader alleges discrimination A former Dolphins cheerleader filed a complaint in Florida against the NFL and the team, alleging discrimination against her religion and gender.
Ex-Saints cheerleader files discrimination claim Former Saints cheerleader Bailey Davis, who was fired in January, has filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over what her attorney called "antiquated" and "blatantly discriminatory" policies. 1 Related
Should the NFL reject Blackwell's proposal, Davis' and Ware's complaints would continue through due process.
"We're not asking them to admit fault, or to admit guilt, or even admit that there is anything wrong," Blackwell said in a phone interview with The New York Times. "But if they do want and expect that cheerleaders should have a fair working environment, as they have stated, then it doesn't make any common sense why the answer would be no."
In response to current and former cheerleaders who recently have discussed the indignities of their job -- including sexual harassment, low pay, long hours and strict rules governing appearance and social media that don't apply to players or other representatives of the team -- the NFL issued a written statement that said it would work with clubs "in sharing best practices" to support cheerleading squads.
"Everyone who works in the NFL, including cheerleaders, has the right to work in a positive and respectful environment that is free from any and all forms of harassment and discrimination and fully complies with state and federal laws," the statement read.
"If the NFL is serious about this statement," Blackwell said in Tuesday's letter, "then this should be an acceptable settlement demand."
Davis was fired from the Saintsations cheerleading squad after posting an Instagram photo showing her in an outfit similar to a one-piece swimsuit. She filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, saying that the Saints have different standards for women and men.
Ware, who worked for three seasons with the Dolphins, filed a complaint this month with the Florida Commission on Human Relations, saying she was subjected to a hostile work environment and discriminated against over gender and religion.
The two other cheerleaders who would attend the meeting with Davis and Ware have not been determined, Blackwell said, but they would not be associated with Blackwell and would come from different teams.
"We want the opportunity for change," Blackwell said, adding that she understood the NFL could meet with them and end up doing nothing.
"I understand that risk," she said. "But it's a risk we're willing to take to try to have real change."
School is out, and so is the sun. It's a good time to think about an outdoor activity like a picnic. If you have ever tried to pack up all the food and supplies in a basket and then attempted to carry it, you know it's no picnic. You might want to consider a canvas tote instead.
One benefit of a fabric tote bag is it is literally a blank canvas just waiting for your own personal touches. A simple way to decorate the bag is to paint it, which calls for nothing more than fabric paint, a paintbrush and a sheet of self-adhesive felt.
Draw stars and stripes on the back side of the self-adhesive felt and cut them out. Peel off the backing and fasten the designs onto the bag. Paint around the stars with blue paint and around the stripes with red paint. When the paint dries, remove the felt to reveal your final design. Cleanup is as easy as rinsing the brushes with warm water, and it's simple to set the paint by ironing the back of the fabric. Extra bonus ... the bag is now washable!
The decorated tote is so lightweight it's possible to jam it with a plethora of picnic supplies including a bottle of wine, breads, cheeses, fruit and even flowers to set the mood. And there's still plenty of room for a tablecloth, dishes and silverware — everything you need for a super picnic.
Jason Isbell seems like the sort of person who looks you in the eye when he talks to you. In his songs, Isbell says exactly what he means. There's no artifice in his lyrics — but that's not to say those lyrics aren't artful. They're plenty artful. They're tough and economical and full of empathy. But you always know exactly what he's saying. There's never any guesswork involved. He takes these vast, world-eating sentiments and boils them down to as few words as possible — makes them sound like the sort of things you might hear someone say at a bar, late at night, when he's had maybe one too many drinks. He doesn't exaggerate, doesn't overstate, doesn't use flowery language. And so when Isbell sings about being afraid to raise a daughter in Donald Trump's America, it doesn't come across as alarmist hyperbole. It comes across as something very, very real, and it's a whole lot scarier for it.
The song in question is “White Man's World,” and it comes from The Nashville Sound, the new album that Isbell recorded with his band the 400 Unit. The song is a seething, boiling blues-rock vamp, a song that sounds like neon beer signs and dark wood panelling and lonely video-poker machines that nobody really plays anymore. Here's how he opens it: “I'm a white man living in a white man's world / Under our roof is a baby girl / I thought the world could be hers someday / But her mama knew better.” The rest of the song is full of quiet little stories like that, stories of unexamined privilege and moments of inaction that Isbell wishes he could take back. He knows he's a beneficiary of centuries of oppression and exploitation. He's been in the room when people told racist jokes, and he hasn't said anything against them. And he's seen the end result of that type of shit, the election that leaves those of us with kids wondering what sort of bullshit world we're handing them. He pleas for empathy, for understanding: “You're still breathing, it's not too late / We're all carrying one burden, sharing one fate.” And here's how he ends it, with his wife Amanda Shires' twangy tenor harmonizing with his big, booming baritone: “I still have faith, but I don't know why / Maybe it's the fire in my little girl's eyes.”
Isbell's personal songs aren't always personal. He's done great work by inhabiting characters, by exploring those characters' dreams and frustrations and dilemmas. And he does that a few times on The Nashville Sound. There's the out-of-work figure from the shut-down mining town on “Cumberland Gap,” the one who knows he won't find work out of town but who can't leave because he's got family who wouldn't be able to get along without him: “Soon as the sun goes down, find my way to the Mustang Lounge / If you don't sit facing the window, you could be in any town.” There's the country transplant on “The Last Of My Kind,” living in a city and feeling deeply out of place: “Tried to go to college but I didn't belong / Everything I said was either funny or wrong / Laughed at my boots and laughed at my jeans / Laughed when they gave me amphetamines.” There's the man on the run in “Tupelo,” the one who's looking for salvation in a girl and in another town, thinking he can outrun his demons but knowing, somewhere deep down, that all of his efforts are doomed.
When he's singing those songs about other people, Isbell doesn't sound any less sincere than he does when he's singing about himself. A lot of that is the force of empathy in Isbell's writing, the way he makes these characters' feelings seem as real as his own. And a lot of that is in the pure aesthetic quality of the music. Isbell doesn't make country music — not really, at least not as it's currently understood — but he's still a great country singer. His voice is big and ragged and tender and plainspoken. He never mumbles and he never swallows his words, and he can hit big, loud, emotive notes without being showy about it.
Isbell broke through with 2013's Southeastern and kept the breakthrough going with 2015's Something More Than Free. Those were both quieter, more intimate records than the ones Isbell had made previously, both with the Drive-By Truckers, the band he'd joined in his early 20s, and then on his own, once he'd left the Truckers. But The Nashville Sound is Isbell's first album since 2011 that gives equal billing to the 400 Unit, putting them on the cover next to him and everything, and it sounds more like a full-band album, with more rockers and more grand, swelling arrangements. I think I prefer Isbell in stripped-down mode, but he knows how to lead a band — something that really becomes obvious when you see him live, when he and his bandmates take turns on blazing solos that still serve the songs. And on record, he finds ways to flesh out his arrangements without losing their melodic or emotive punch. If you came on board with either of the last two albums, as I did, then there's no reason to resist what he's doing here, especially considering that the lyrics Isbell is writing here are among the finest of his career. And as great as those short-story songs can be, it's the songs that Isbell sings from his own perspective that really knock me off my feet.
The Nashville Sound is the first album that Isbell has made since becoming a father last year, and fatherhood completely suffuses it. It's an album made from the weird, blissful, paranoiac haze that comes with new parenthood. And it's a case of Isbell using the fact of his fatherhood, the new perspective it gives him, as a way to look at the world. You can hear that clearly in “White Man's World,” but it's there on the rest of the album as well, even the songs that aren't about parenthood directly. “Anxiety” is the state where you know your life is good but you can't enjoy anything — you can't even fucking sleep — because of the persistent feeling that it could all go away at any moment. Fatherhood doesn't exactly stop that feeling. If anything, it makes it worse. “If We Were Vampires” is a love song to Isbell's wife, sung in close harmony with Shires, and it's about the dark feeling that a whole life lived with someone still isn't enough: “It's knowing that this can't go on forever / Likely, one of us will spend some days alone / Maybe we'll get 40 years together / But one day I'll be gone, or one day you'll be gone.” Fatherhood doesn't make that go away, either.
And then there's “Something To Love,” the last song on the album. It's the album's most traditional country-folk song, and it's about traditional country-folk stuff. On the song, Isbell sings about being a kid on a porch in the deep south, listening to the people in his family playing music together: “Old women harmonizing with the wind / Singing softly to the Savior like a friend.” And as the song gets ready to end, Isbell sings directly to his daughter, tells her why that memory matters to him and why it might matter to her: “You were born on a hot late summer day / We turned you loose and tried to stay out of your way / I don't quite recognize the world that you'll call home / Just find what makes you happy, girl, and do it till you're gone.” Isbell first impressed many of us with the Drive-By Truckers 2003 song “Outfit,” a devastating reverie about heartfelt advice that he'd gotten from his father. And now, he's ending an album with just-as-heartfelt advice for his daughter. And the ability to sing a line like that last one — to sing it without breaking, while still holding that metaphorical eye contact with whoever's listening — is something truly special.
The Nashville Sound is out 6/16 on Isbell's own Southeastern label. Stream it here.

Rumors have been floating around for a few months now of a new device from Amazon that would mash up the media streaming capabilities of its Fire TV line with the voice assistant abilities of the Echo. After leaked images turned up showing a cube-shaped device that seemed to fit the bill, people started referring to this still as-of-yet unannounced device as the “Fire TV Cube.”
Sure enough: a seemingly official page has been found tucked away on Amazon.com that mentions a Fire TV Cube, and promises “details coming soon.”
As found by AFTVNews, the placeholder splash page offers up little beyond the promise of eventual details. It's got a big ol' header that says “What is Fire TV Cube?”, a button to let you sign up for more details and… well, that's about it.
There's also a mention of a “Fire TV Cube” on this page, tucked away in Amazon's account management backend to let folks toggle their subscriptions to any one of the dozens of newsletters/email campaigns that Amazon sends out.
According to the original leaks, the Fire TV Cube would have the speaker, far-field microphones and LED light bar of an Echo and the 4K video-capable guts of a Fire TV, allowing you to hook it up to your TV and have one device doing double the duties.
In other words: While there's still no official word on when (or if!) this thing will actually ship, it definitely looks like they're prepping for something behind the scenes.
The companies behind the two biggest battle royale video games are about to see who's the last man standing in court.
PUBG Corp., developer of “PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds” and subsidiary of Bluehole Inc., is suing the Korean unit of “Fortnite” developer Epic Games, Bloomberg reports. In a lawsuit filed in South Korea, PUBG accuses Epic of copyright infringement.
“This is a measure to protect our copyrights,” PUBG Corp. told Bloomberg.
“PUBG,” which launched in March 2017, is a competitive online game where 100 players are dropped onto a map and forced to scavenge weapons and equipment while fighting each other. The last person standing wins the match. Epic Games launched a battle royale mode for its co-op sandbox shooter “Fortnite” about six months later. It has a similar concept, but adds a building mechanic to the mix. After it launched, “PUBG” publisher Bluehole said it was contemplating “further action” against Epic for “replicating the experience for which ‘PUBG' is known.”
While “PUBG” popularized the current battle royale genre first, it now finds itself in “Fortnite's” considerably larger shadow. “PUBG” has reportedly sold over 30 million copies since launch, but its player base on PC is dropping, according to IGN. Meanwhile, “Fortnite” is currently the largest free-to-play console game of all time, and it's dominating PC and mobile as well. It made five times “PUBG Mobile's” first week revenue on iOS, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. It's also currently the most-watched game on Twitch and YouTube.

This is not the first time PUBG Corp. has sued over copyright infringement. It filed a suit back in April against mobile developer NetEase, claiming two of its titles — “Rules of Survival” and “Knives Out” — copied ‘PUBG's' gameplay.
This new suit is unusual because both companies are partly owned by technology giant Tencent. “PUBG” is also built on Unreal Engine technology, which is owned by Epic Games.
Neither Epic Games nor PUBG Corp. have responded to Variety‘s request for comment.

The Bharatiya Janata Party, which heads the government, as well as its coalition parties namely Goa Forward Party and Maharashtrawadi Gomatak Party, besides the opposition Congress, all unanimously alleged that the police-drug trader nexus is mainly responsible for the flourishing narcotics trade in Goa.
Maintaining that drug trade has become rampant in the north Goan beach belt, Minister for Town and Country Planning Vijai Sardesai on Monday accused the state police of being in connivance with the drug traders operating in Goa.
“Drug trade cannot work without involvement of police,” the leader of Goa Forward Party observed, charging that the drug trade is going on with the help of some corrupt police officers. He further added that the backbone of the drug mafia should be broken, maintaining that, “Our government would do it.”
Sardesai reiterated that without patronage from some corrupt police officials, the drug trade just cannot run smoothly in Goa.
Sharing the observation of Sardesai, Tourism Minister Manohar ‘Babu' Azgaonkar said that the death of two men hailing from Tamil Nadu, last weekend, due to suspected drug overdose at a party at the Vagator beach, is a matter of shame for the state government.
The two men were part of a group, which had arrived in the state for a vacation.
“It is high time the Chief Minister took stringent action against police in whose jurisdiction the drugs have been found,” demanded the Tourism Minister, who represents the MGP. “The PIs and PCs should be held responsible,” he observed, adding “We want drug-free Goa and drug-free tourism, as drugs bring a bad name to the state tourism.”
Meanwhile, BJP MLA from Calangute Michael Lobo met Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar as regards the alarmingly growing narcotic trade menace in the coastal belt.
Later, speaking to the media, he stated that police are unable to deal with the drug menace and a special team under the Chief Minister, comprising of coastal MLAs as well as representatives of the village panchayats needs to be formed to tackle the menace. “This team should include the DGP, and the senior officials of the Anti Narcotics Cell as well as the Crime Branch, among others,” he added.
“Police are patronising drugs in the coastal belt,” Lobo alleged, observing that the Anjuna-Vagator belt has almost gone out of control (of the police).
The Calangute MLA also maintained that the progress made by the police in controlling the drug trade, the related arrests made by them, the amount of drugs seized and other such information should be released regularly, which will bring the drug trade in the state under control.
In response to the statement of Lobo, Congress leader and former Calangute MLA, Agnel Fernandes, addressing a press conference Monday noon challenged the present Calangute legislator to go public with the names of the police officers, who are in touch with criminal elements involved in the drug trade.
“Lobo should make the names of these police officers public, who are in touch with the drug traders,” stated Fernandes.
The former Calangute MLA further stated that one can see the drug peddlers openly selling drugs along the Candolim-Anjuna stretch. “Any tourism state has got its own ills. However, it is definitely not as rampant as in Goa,” he retorted.

I looked at the old farmer in the village, as he stood in front of me with his fourteen children. “Do you know,” I said angrily, “that one out of six people in the world are Indians.” “What can I do sir,” said the farmer, “our wives can conceive only once in every nine months otherwise we could have made it one in every two being an Indian.”
“No, no,” I said, getting even more angry, “you are producing too many children.” “What!” said the farmer. “My brother has doubled my number, my father has just become a father all over again. Making more children is an art.”
“An art,” I said with astonishment. “Yes,” said the farmer, “how many children do most Americans have?”. “One,” I said. “Aha, aha,” said the farmer in the village, “see, see, all the American technology in the world can't help him.” “I don't think that's the point,” I said.
“It is,” said the farmer, as his youngest baby tried to catch his thumb. “Every country is famous for producing something or other. America produces millions of cars, Japan produces…. What does Japan produce?,” asked the farmer of his eldest son.
“Karate,” said his eldest, giving a flying kick. “Ah karate,” said the farmer. “China produces ping-pong, but does anyone stop them making cars or karate or ping-pong.” “I don't think you …………,” I said. “No, no, listen to me,” said the farmer vehemently. “Look at my children, do you think that ping-pong or karate is better than them. Do you think that that fancy car you came in looks better than my daughter?”
“No………..” I said, “but……………….” “So,” said the farmer triumphantly, “be proud of your country's production. Good-bye.”
“Wait,” I shouted running after the farmer, “where are you going.” “To my factory,” said the farmer turning in the direction of his little hut, “it is bad enough that my brother has produced more than me, now you are telling me that the rest of the world is producing more than us. Let me go and give my mite to our nation's production…………..!”
I watched the farmer enter his hut and know that unless somebody had the courage to do something drastic in the country, this was one production line, which would never o on strike…!

Many music industry idols shuffled off this mortal coil in 2016, but perhaps one of the most influential was the legendary artist David Bowie. One of the Brixton born musician's final gifts to the world was a collaboration with Irish playwright Enda Walsh and Belgian director Ivo van Hove, to make a musical sequel to Nicolas Roeg's sci-fi drama The Man Who Fell to Earth. The result was a musical called Lazarus, which premiered on Broadway and has enjoyed a hugely successful run in one of the vast pop up auditoriums in Kings Cross. I felt the surreal, cerebral production was an appropriate way to mark my final theatre visit of the year, writes Nicky Sweetland.
Unlike the 1976 film, which starred Bowie, Lazarus doesn't follow an easily interpreted narrative and instead relies heavily on the audience's ability to suspend reality and become immersed in the star-man's world of semi consciousness.
Bowie's alien Newton is played with a brooding torment by Michael C Hall, whose strong voice and boozy deportment expertly conveys the displaced troubled soul within.
Newton has become stranded on Earth and even though he has enjoyed the trappings of wealth and celebrity, his desperation to return to his own planet has manifested in alcohol addiction, as he yearns for his deceased blue haired soul mate, Mary Lou. His housekeeper Elly (Amy Lennox vividly chaotic) becomes infected by his despair and delves into an obsession, which results in a psychotic impersonation of Newton's lost love.
With a chorus of specters in azure wigs and a backdrop of hypnotic projections by Tal Yarden, we are further drawn into the mind of the otherworldly creature, where we find the frighteningly charismatic Valentine (Michael Esper, wonderfully roguish) and the unnamed Girl (Sophia Anne Caruso, vocally stunning and utterly enchanting).
The undoubted attraction of the show for many will be Bowie's back catalogue, which does, at times feel a little shoe horned in, but nonetheless provides a fitting reminder as to why the legendary songwriter is so celebrated, with well known songs like All the Young Dudes and Heroes rocking the rafters of the cowshed like auditorium.
I'm not going to pretend I knew what was going on at all times, but I'm not sure I was supposed to, however, after I had embraced the way out weirdness I discovered an attractive production with a tremendous soundtrack performed with excellence.
Lazarus is playing at the King's Cross Theatre until 22nd January.
A Pokkén Tournament event at SwitchFest in California crowdfunded travel for two internationally elite competitors, Tsubasa “CrossIgarashi” Igarashi of Japan and José Manuel “XAbsoluted“ Sanjuán Carreño of Spain. Curiously, it wasn't just fans and spectators supporting these players, but also their direct competition.
Like much of the community, Allister Singh—a high-level player from California that competes under his first name—actively promoted and donated to SwitchFest's efforts to bring in more competition, benefiting the scene in general while also hurting his own chances at winning the tournament in the process. After all was said and done, over $2,000 was collected to bring CrossIgarashi and XAbsoluted to the event.
“I always welcome flying in the best of the best,” Allister told Compete. “When I first discovered that these two players had a chance to attend SwitchFest, I was ecstatic to have even more talented competition. It really pushes me and others to prepare and do our best, which is what we always want. It's an extremely valuable experience to play international players in an offline experience, which helps us all improve in the long run.”
CrossIgarashi and XAbsoluted ended up placing first and second, respectively, while Allister finished the weekend in third after losses to both players. First place was worth $500, second $200, and third $130, so it's safe to say that Allister cost himself at least a couple hundred bucks in addition to whatever he donated to the travel fund. The rest of the finals bracket was filled with Americans, but the championship match was an indication of just how intense competition is across the globe. The excitement they provided helped promote the passion of the Pokkén community, and while it affected him personally, Allister doesn't feel remorse for the part he played in raising the necessary funds to fly in this foreign talent.

“I feel absolutely zero regret for pushing to have these two players being invited,” he explained. “I believe it's significant to push this kind of community funded events because it brings us closer and strengthens our bonds with each other. As a community, this kind of stuff should always be the goal. Having talented players from across the world compete with our region will always be priceless. We get to show each other how much we have progressed, and get to compare each other's play styles, which is so invaluable. In the end, it's all about the competitive spirit and the friendships we form.”
Honestly, the rewards for improving in fighting games are minimal compared to the likes League of Legends and Overwatch. If big money or other opportunities were involved, I'm uncertain if the fighting game community would continue to support initiatives like the one that brought CrossIgarashi and XAbsoluted to SwitchFest. But it's clear that, in the absence of esports' influence, the scene has developed a culture in which bettering oneself is its own reward, even if that means losing a tournament here or there.

Criminals are combing through obituary columns to find vulnerable widowed pensioners to defraud - sometimes taking hundreds of thousands of pounds from their eventual victims. But a specialist ‘scambusters' team in North Yorkshire are leading the fightback. Chris Burn reports.
It is a photograph that illustrates the massive scale of the challenge facing North Yorkshire's ‘scambusters' team when it comes to dealing with frauds against vulnerable and elderly residents.
The detached house overgrown with vegetation shown in the aerial image is occupied by an isolated widow who became a victim of cold-calling criminals who defrauded her for substandard roofing work.
But the existence of the woman and the crime against her was only uncovered when the scambusting team uncovered what had happened to her through examination through criminal bank accounts as part of a wide-ranging investigation into doorstep crime.
North Yorkshire County Council's Multi-Agency Safeguarding Team – also known as Operation Gauntlet - is constantly dealing with the fall-out from doorstep crime, telephone and mail scams. Since last July, the team has successfully prosecuted 21 offenders, with criminals being sent to jail for a combined 23 years.
It was the first of its kind in the UK to tackle both vulnerability and financial abuse; an initiative which came out of a restructuring of the county council's trading standards service.
The majority of victims are older, vulnerable people many of them alone and isolated.
North Yorkshire is England's largest rural county and has a growing older and isolated population, making it rich pickings for doorstep and other criminals. For this reason, the team also aims to tackle the loneliness and isolation that often leads people to become repeat victims.
Up to 40 per cent of doorstep crime victims say they are lonely and 25 per cent say they feel lonely every day. For many of these victims the fraudster may be their only significant human contact.
Answering the phone, a letter or opening the door to these people may be the only social contact victims are getting.
North Yorkshire's chief executive Richard Flinton, a former trading standards officer himself, knows all too well the lengths criminals will go to exploit isolated and vulnerable victims.
“You would be surprised how many people have nobody in their life as they get older, literally nobody. Victims might be former solicitors, doctors, professionals because they are the ones with money. They might have lost a spouse; their family might live far away. They have nobody to talk to; they might have health issues; they lose the confidence they once had. Fraudsters go through the obituary columns to identify potential victims. They know how to get people to open their door to them.
“We had one man in the Malton area who had been defrauded of £250,000 over eight years for property repairs and other frauds. When we pulled in the fraudsters he was grief-stricken. He thought of them as his best mates. They'd become his only male company.”
One 91 year old woman in Hambleton lost £200,000 to mail scammers over two years. She was answering letters and writing cheques every day. But she didn't want the letters to stop. She was widowed and lonely with only one distant relative and the letters were her only regular contact with the outside world.
In all such cases North Yorkshire's Muli-Agency Safeguarding Team also works to set up social networks for these victims to tackle their loneliness.
Flinton says: “If we don't tackle the root causes, the loneliness and the isolation, then we are leaving people vulnerable to repeat victimisation.”
North Yorkshire's chief executive Richard Flinton, a former trading standards officer himself, is proud of the team and its ferociousness in pursuit of doorstep criminals and their assets.
“The population in North Yorkshire is ageing and tackling issues around isolation and loneliness is a priority for us. As part of this we will continue to go after people who see older people in rural villages and towns as rich pickings. Many trading standards departments are shadows of their former selves and shy away from prosecutions. We back Ruth and her team because we must not lose the ability to take these criminals on.”

ST. LOUIS – It's more than just a slice of pie at Café Piazza – it's a slice of life.
“You see people sitting down and working while eating and working while waiting for their food,” says Vito Lafata III. “Unplug. Give yourself a break, especially during meal time.”
While Lafata is hoping you'll come for the authentic Italian food to Café Piazza, chances are you'll be all eyes on the ceiling.
“Like Paco says, ‘the masterpiece is never finished,'” says Lafata.
“Especially when you paint ceilings,” says artist Paco Rosic. “You should try to do your name like this, ‘cause everything is 10 times harder because everything you see is differently.”
Fox 2/KPLR 11 first introduced you to Paco Rosic in April. The Bosnian born, Iowa-based artist spent the summer in St. Louis painting the history of this city in spray paint. But the masterpiece is finally finished and the food is being served.
The Benton Park business has opened its doors after using their windows to bring in the oven.
“I got to tell you, we called her Big Mama,” says Lafata. “She's 4,200 pounds when it came on the truck and I was like, ‘Whoa, that's a big mama.' And the name stuck. We had to bring it in through the window of the building and she put up a fight. We finally got her in her spot and let me tell you, she's hot man.”
Across the street from Gus' Pretzels at the corner of Lemp and Arsenal, the new corner business with brunch on the weekends is where you can see St. Louis past and present in paint, and the future in food, thanks to one big mama.

Five students participated in a protest against President Trump's actions on Feb. 2 during U-hour. The protest occurred at the Kellogg Plaza while a different event was in process.
They did not have an official leader, but junior student Solara Medina is taking action for her beliefs. Medina's friends and other students joined her to protest.
She said she worries how President Trump's policies will affect local students.
Medina said many students will be affected by the immigration laws President Trump has imposed, especially with some families being separated.
Medina acknowledges CSUSM for being open to different cultures but would like to see students take action and not be bystanders on issues that are occurring after President Trump taking office.
She is a United States citizen, a Mexican-American and a first-generation college student. This is her country and home, and all of Trump's policies affect her, says Medina.
“Please join us and spread the message. Please take into consideration that everything that is happening will affect you, whether you recognize it or not,” said Medina.
The protesters walked in a circle with signs. With a megaphone, the protestors expressed their message against Trump and the construction of the wall.
Medina organized the protest spontaneously but plans on protesting at least once a week during U-hour. She is still not on social media but says it's a work in progress. Medina invites all students to join her.

Roberto Firmino very nearly opened the scoring for Liverpool in their Champions league semi-final clash with Roma - despite being offside.
And no, before you begin, the assistant referee didn't overlook the fact the Brazilian had mistimed his run and strayed into an offside position.
Instead, the linesman lost the flag from his, well, his flag. This meant he could only hold a little black stick aloft, which looked like a wand, as many pointed out on social media.
Fortunately Firmino fired wide as the assistant referee attempted to flag furiously, and the match official read the situation, to relieve some of the confusion.

Well can you imagine the linesman trying to explain the situation inside a packed Anfield after apparently failing to flag Firmino offside if he had scored?
BT Sport cameras kept an eye on the situation as the linesman tried and failed and tried some more to fix his flag.

Eventually the assistant referee received some assistance of his own, and a member of stadium staff came to the rescue.
But he couldn't fix the flag either... what a disaster. Eventually the linesman was handed a brand-new flag. What a stressful shift for the poor chap, eh?
ATP Flight School has added King Schools' online video courses to its Airline Career Pilot Program.
On sign-up, students will get a head-start with the King Schools Private Pilot Ground School and Test Prep Course.
Then, when they start their flight training, they will be enrolled in the King Schools Private Pilot Practical Test Course, which provides HD video showing a model checkride with an FAA examiner using the new Airmen Certification Standards (ACS).
To provide a leg up in operating the Garmin 430, the standardized GPS platform in the ATP fleet, students will also receive the King Schools Garmin 430 Online Video Course, according to ATP Flight School officials.
All three courses are integrated into ATP's online student portal, where students go for access to resources needed during their training.
“We've gotten rave responses from our students about the King video courses,” said Justin Dennis, ATP president. “We take students from zero time to an airline cockpit in about two years. To make that happen we have to be organized and efficient. The clear, simple and practical King courses will be key in helping us accomplish that. We are looking to expand our use of King online video courses in the future.”
“We have some fun with the teaching, and ATP's students recognize and appreciate that,” said King Schools' Co-Founder John King. “Also, the courses can be viewed online on any device and are compatible with the King Schools Companion App, which enables offline access with synched progress on iPhones and iPads. The students can take the King courses anywhere and study them anytime, which is exactly what ATP's students need.”
The Northern Ireland “Troubles” — really a low-grade civil war — lasted 30 years. During that period, more than 3,600 people died from car bombs, street violence or skirmishes between Catholic paramilitaries who wanted to join the Irish Republic and Protestant Unionist paramilitaries who wanted to stay in the United Kingdom.
The problem seemed intractable precisely because it was so black and white. Catholic vs. Protestant, united Ireland vs. United Kingdom: There seemed no room for compromise. But when the Good Friday agreement was negotiated in 1998, a compromise was found. Devolution of power from London to Belfast helped. But so did the European Union. Because both Ireland and Britain were E.U. members, no border was needed between the two. Because the E.U. had harmonized regulation, trade was smooth. Residents of Belfast who wanted to be Irish could get Irish passports. Thousands did — including Protestants. The question of which group would rule didn't disappear so much as dissolve. Things grew blurrier. Sovereignty, once everyone agreed to share it, ceased to be a source of conflict.
The struggle for influence didn't exactly go away. But the violence morphed into something else: a bureaucratic tangle, an unending argument, a squabble about power-sharing. Over time, the whole Northern Ireland problem became . . . boring. Boring was a lot better than violent. But it also meant that Northern Irish politics drifted off London's front pages, migrating into history books and West End plays. During the Brexit referendum campaign, it barely figured. Immediately afterward, I happened to be in Belfast. “They forgot about us,” someone told me.
This week, they were forced to remember, because Britain's decision to leave the E.U. — which was partly motivated by people who want a return to old-fashioned forms of sovereignty — has the potential to drag Northern Ireland out of the realm of blurred identities and back into the clear blue, zero-sum, black-and-white world of stark choices. The most important one sounds like a technicality: If Britain leaves not only the European Union's political institutions (which is certain) but also its customs union (which is optional, though the Brexiteers are pushing for this), then there has to be a customs border between Britain and Ireland.
Either that border can run through the middle of the island, once again separating north and south, or it can lie, in effect, in the Irish Sea, between the island of Ireland and the British mainland.
The construction of a border through the island is not just unpopular; it is probably also impossible. There are hundreds of roads and paths across the border, not to mention fields and forests that straddle it. Chances that border posts would be circumvented, ignored, vandalized or worse are high; the possibility that the border would revive the Irish Republican Army cannot be excluded. British Prime Minister Theresa May took the other road: Perhaps Northern Ireland and the Republic could maintain “regulatory alignment” — a curious phrase that could imply that the North stays in the customs union with Ireland, while the rest of the U.K. takes off in a different direction. In other words, the border would move to the Irish Sea.
The result? May's coalition partners, the Democratic Unionists, revolted. Suddenly, they feared losing sovereignty once again. Their leader could not have been more clear: “We will not accept any form of regulatory divergence which separates Northern Ireland economically or politically from the rest of the United Kingdom.” Negotiations ground to a halt.
The solution, announced with great fanfare early Friday, was — and yes, this is the technical term used by the experts — a “fudge.” It was an agreement to agree later, to talk about it in a couple of years when the other elements of the E.U./U.K. relationship are clearer. It is still possible that Northern Ireland will wind up with special status. It is still possible that the British government, under this prime minister or another one, will wind up inside the customs union.
The squabble was suppressed beneath the bureaucratic E.U. language everyone loves to hate. But it offered a brief hint of the conflicts that could be brought to life when the smothering blanket of European law is removed from Britain. It was also a reminder of what united Europe, with its boring consensus procedures, achieved even in Britain, a country that never fully accepted this way of doing things.
Certainly there are drawbacks to shared sovereignty of the kind the E.U. requires. In Northern Ireland, both sides had to give things up. Neither is entirely satisfied. The political squabble for power — not only along the Irish border but along the Franco-German border, the Hungarian-Romanian border and many others, too — is dull and unsatisfying. But no one dies.
An evacuation is underway in Kaschechewan, seen in this undated handout aerial photo. ( THE CANADIAN PRESS )
An evacuation due to flooding fears was underway Monday at a remote First Nation community in northern Ontario. Kashechewan First Nation Deputy Chief Hosea Wesley said more than 300 people from his community flew to Kapuskasing, Ont., on Sunday and about 200 residents were expected to leave over the course of Monday and Tuesday as major ice jams about 20 kilometres upriver threaten to flood the community near the mouth of James Bay. Children, the elderly and the sick are being evacuated first as a precautionary measure, Wesley said, noting that the exodus has become an annual voyage for the community that sits on the Albany River. “Our people are really tired of these evacuations and flooding, especially the children,” Wesley told The Canadian Press from Kashechewan. “They cannot really study in school when this happens every year. We really, really need to move the community to higher ground, but we're waiting for help from the governments.”

Local officials in consultation with the province will monitor the ice as open water moves toward the reserve where more than 2,000 people live. Flooding occurs when the ice jams, which causes water levels to rise and puts pressure on the dike wall next to Kashechewan, Wesley said. High water can simply spill over the top of the dike. Area MP Charlie Angus echoed Wesley's desire to move the community.
“Their dike wall, despite the millions the government spent on it, cannot be made safe,” he said. “The risk factors too high if something goes wrong.” Angus was referring to a 2015 engineering assessment that concluded the condition of the protective ring dike posed an “intolerable” risk to the community and was susceptible to a sudden rise in water levels. In late March, Kashechewan First Nation and Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents the interests of multiple northern Ontario First Nations, signed an agreement with the province and the federal government to “support a sustainable future” for the northern community. In a statement at the time, the federal government said the agreement will “focus on improving outcomes in priority areas including housing, socio-economic sustainability, health programs and facilities, infrastructure development, and schools and community facilities.” That includes exploring options for relocation of the entire community. Angus said without any financial commitment from the federal government, there's no way the community will be moving in the near future. “We've spent millions of dollars on the dike wall, we've spent millions of dollars in evacuation, spent millions of dollars dealing with the damaged infrastructure from flooding year after year and the community is still at risk,” Angus said. “This is no future for the people of Kashechewan, they deserve better, they deserve a safe community on safe ground, so let's get down to it and get to work.” The evacuees' spirits remain high given the circumstances, said Gerry Demeules, who is the evacuation co-ordinator with the Town of Kapuskasing, where hundreds have been put up in motels. “We've been doing this for 12 years now so we've sort of got the hang of it,” Demeules said. “No issues so far.”
Since 2001, impact VC firms have raised $13 billion to invest in companies that provide a social or environmental benefit as part of running their for-large-profit business. Indeed, $10 billion of that has been raised since 2010 alone. Impact VCs are VCs first that intend to generate market-beating financial returns because of, not in spite of, an impact-oriented investment thesis.
To date, these impact VC funds have yet to be categorized as a venture trend. Too often they are mistakenly lumped in the general impact investing category, a very broad space of investors — from foundations to private equity to wealth management — that seek social or environmental impact, but for near-market, sub-market or even net-zero financial returns. Impact VCs focus on early-stage and mid-stage private businesses and most have institutional LPs that are expecting 3x or higher returns on their investments.
Similarly, the for-large-profit businesses in which they invest, which have been identified as a trend, do not have a consistent moniker that encompasses the whole sector. In the last 30 years, these companies have been called double-bottom line, triple-bottom line, ESG, social enterprise, benefit corporations, B Corps, profit-from-purpose and more, which are all relevant, but don't cover the whole category.
Of those, I prefer profit-from-purpose, as it makes clear there is a higher purpose to the company, but profit always comes first. However, if I could wave my wand and assign the sector a catch-name akin to fintech and SaaS, I would assign the name GoodBusiness to the sector of for-large-profit businesses that also provide a social or environmental benefit.
15 years of impact VC fundraises
I've prepared what I believe is the first comparison of all impact VC funds. It includes data on fund size, fund count and age, GPs, LPs, relevant investments and exits and the firms' mission statements. I include only funds investing in startups (seed to late-stage) for top-quartile returns that explicitly state their profit-from-purpose investing strategy and have a portfolio that is at least 50 percent invested in GoodBusiness.
Impact venture capital will not be overlooked or misunderstood for long.
While many traditional funds invest in businesses with social or environmental missions, if backing GoodBusiness companies is not their primary mission, I did not include them. Likewise, I did not include family funds, even those dedicated to impact, if it was not possible to extract what percent of the fund is dedicated to direct startup investments.
Impact venture capital will not be overlooked or misunderstood for long. DBL Partners (as in double-bottom line) created one of the earliest traditional impact VC funds in 2004, and has had big exits in Tesla, SolarCity, eMeter and OPX Bio, among others. Other investors have had healthy exits with 7th Generation, FLS Energy, Nest Labs, SolarBridge, 2U, Chariot, SKS Microfinance, Ujjivan Financial Services and more. This investment sector is also growing quickly; $3 billion in new funds (TPG Rise and Breakthrough Energy) were announced recently.
Broad-focus impact VC funds
Jeffrey Skoll's six-year-old Capricorn Investment Group is currently the sector behemoth, with more than $5 billion raised in 24 funds. Al Gore and David Blood's roughly $2 billion Generation Investment Management fund is very active in later-stage deals as part of their $12 billion private equity fund. Both are very broadly invested and have had some notable exits. Capricorn, notably, is a certified B Corp itself, making it, I believe, the financially largest B Corp in the world.
The sector started taking form, however, with the launch of a number of traditional VC-style firms whose total fund raises range between $100 and $900 million. Elevar Equity, LeapFrog Investments, Collaborative Fund, Obvious Ventures and Renewal Funds all invest broadly in GoodBusiness.
These funds invest from seed to late stage, and are standing in to back businesses much earlier in their trajectories than Capricorn or Generation. We should expect more fundraises and aggressive investing from this group, though some are still waiting on their first GoodBusiness exits. In the sub-$100 million categories, City Light Capital, Vast Ventures, Better Ventures, Radicle Impact and Pi Investments (part of a family fund) also are making broad sector investments.
Founder/LP funds
The hardest impact VC to pin down is where the founders are the sole LPs. They tend to be discreet about fund totals, are unrestricted in how they use their money and are unconcerned about future fundraisers.
Omidyar Network is the oldest and most well-known. They allocate their funds for a spectrum of financial returns, ranging from commercial (VC returns) to sub-commercial (impact investing) to outright charitable donations. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will be doing the same, but is expected to eventually have $45 billion in funds, enough to possible transform entire ecosystems.
Millennial and modern shoppers have high expectations for the companies they patronize.
Laurene Powell Jobs' new Emerson Collective hasn't exposed how they'll be using her $20 billion net worth (so they're not included in my analysis), but have stated commitments to supporting entrepreneurs creating positive social change. Kapor Capital is a dedicated VC fund that works closely with their Kapor Center for Social Impact. Freada Kapor Klein is very clear about how they leverage the Kapor Center to guide the Kapor Capital investment team to determine which potential investments targeting America's underrepresented STEM students and entrepreneurs will have the most commercial potential.
The enhanced VC opportunity for these funds is that if you can catalyze change on first-order problems using donation dollars, you're ideally positioned to reap financial returns by backing the entrepreneurs and businesses that will best serve newly opened marketplaces.
Impact VC sub-sectors
The largest industry sub-sector centers around protecting the earth's environment. Reducing or reversing climate change, alternative energy and resources, improving water quality and access, decreasing waste and improving the food system are embraced by many funds. Breakthrough Energy, a new billion-dollar fund backed by a who's who of tech billionaires, is focused exclusively on alternative energy solutions. Another estimated $300+ million has been raised by Closed Loop Fund (recycling), Prelude Ventures (climate change), EFW Partners (energy, food, water) and Closed Loop Capital (food and agriculture).
Another $1.25 billion is dedicated for businesses serving the billion people forecast to enter the middle class in emerging markets this decade. LeapFrog Ventures, Elevar Equity, Gray Ghost Ventures and Khosla Impact are focused on large frontier markets opportunities. For two years I served as COO of Tala, a rapidly growing mobile-based financial service provider targeting the underserved in emerging markets. I experienced firsthand how fast a business can grow by smartly offering fair and convenient services to people who have been mistreated or ignored entirely by existing providers. This sector will achieve exceptional returns because of the combination of massive markets and a relative dearth of investment capital.
There's also a growing sub-sector of businesses providing high-value products in Western economies. These funds are confident that millennial and modern shoppers have high expectations for the companies they patronize. They want to know management is ethical, employees are treated well, supply chains are clean of exploitation and that the environment is respected in the creation of their product.
Patagonia, 7th Generation, Ben & Jerry's and Dansko are all showing, it pays to be a B Corp. Both TOMS Social Entrepreneurship Fund and Patagonia's Tin Shed Ventures have grown out of ethically minded B Corps and invest in early- and mid-stage GoodBusiness consumer-focused startups. Core Innovation Capital is focused on providing fair and trustworthy financial services, a sector historically known for deceptive pricing, unethical management and bad customer service. Fledge is the first B Corp-oriented accelerator.
The newest and smallest sub-sector is focused on good governance and supporting unrepresented founders and entrepreneurs. Village Capital, Impact America Fund and Backstage Capital are all seeking out and supporting businesses that are often overlooked by traditional VC. From their perspective, their investing is the impact. They seek to jump-start new classes of business people that will transform society by opening new opportunities for more unrepresented business leaders in the years to come.
What's next?
The concurrent global trends of handheld internet connectivity, digital money and wallets, socio-economic turmoil as we exit the Industrial Age, global climate change, rapid population growth, broadening financial inequality and the rise of the global middle class will continue to expose social and environmental problems and opportunities that will allow for different types of businesses than industrial capitalism created. Elon Musk is the most admired leader in technology. Unilever is rumored to become the world's largest publicly traded B Corp. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative shows that investing LLCs, not charitable foundations, are how billionaires will give back.
Even Dick Cheney can see the relentless innovation in alternative energies is going to swamp carbon-based industrial in our lifetimes. And even a factory worker can see that robotics, automation and AI are going to decimate a once-reliable job sector, while climate change may affect many others.
Funds that back the alternative energy trends, alternatives to natural resource extraction and improved agriculture will all do well. Funds that back products and services for the large underserved classes will do well. Funds that focus on creating the job sectors of the future will do very well.
While I expect many of the above impact VC funds to expand and raise more funds, and I expect more funds to arrive globally, I expect dedicated sector expansion will slow in 10-15 years. The change will come when traditional VC funds expand their investment theses to include GoodBusiness, and raise funds and bring on partners to focus just on that.
While President Trump's buy-American, pro-fossil fuel, pro-heavy industry, anti-science and climate-denial platform will get the short-term attention, there is no stopping the global trends I listed above. Now's the time to invest in the long game.

RENTON, Wash. -- When Brandon Marshall visited the Seattle Seahawks as a restricted free agent in 2010, the team flew him into its lakefront headquarters via a seaplane. It was a pull-out-all-the-stops move by Pete Carroll, who, in his first season in Seattle following nine at USC, was tapping into his recruiting background to try to woo one of the best available receivers.
The Seahawks didn't need a seaplane to land Marshall eight years later. At 34 years old and coming off a pair of surgeries, he feels grateful to have another shot. He's getting it in Seattle after signing a one-year deal that was agreed to on Tuesday.
"I didn't have a ton of options," Marshall said Wednesday following the Seahawks' fifth organized team activity. "I think the sentiment around the league is that I'm done, and I get it. Rightfully so. When you get on the other side of 30 and your production slips and you have a big injury, people just count you out. So it was an interesting process. It was a humbling process, to say the least. There were some really tough days that I had to push through, mentally and physically, so for this to be an opportunity and come to [fruition], you can't ask for a better situation. You've got probably a top-three quarterback, you've got one the best franchises, you've got a young nucleus, guys that are hungry and ready to compete."
Marshall took part in Wednesday's practice, sporting the No. 15 that he has worn for most of his NFL career. He caught some passes from Russell Wilson and Seattle's other quarterbacks during positional periods, but he didn't take part in any of the 11-on-11 drills.
"We just had to just ease him in today," Carroll said. "Just get him started, get him on the field with us and Friday we'll do a little bit more, just keep growing with it."

Marshall's contract can be worth up to $2 million with incentives, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. That may seem like a pittance for someone who's been one of the most productive receivers of his era. Marshall has topped 1,000 yards in eight of his 12 seasons, most recently in 2015 with the New York Jets, and his six seasons with at least 100 catches are the most in NFL history, according to ESPN Stats & Information.
But that price is reflective of his age and health. His 2017 season ended after five games because of an ankle injury that he had surgically repaired, leading the New York Giants to release him in April with a failed-physical designation. Marshall revealed Wednesday that he also had surgery to fix a toe injury that had been bothering him since midway through the 2015 season, saying he had previously intended to put it off until he retired because it came with such a long rehab but that the ankle injury gave him that time.
Marshall said he was first able to run without pain again a few days after the Giants released him in April. His recovery from the toe surgery, he said, has taken the longest.
"I feel good. I don't feel great," he said. "Obviously, I've got a lot of catching up to do and get into some football shape. Since the end of October, I was working with Coach [Aaron] Wellman, our head strength and conditioning coach with the Giants, and we'd been doing a lot of rehab, fixing things. So now the last couple weeks, I've finally got an opportunity to go into training, getting better at catching the ball, getting better at route-running, getting better at decelerating and all those little things that make you a great wide receiver.
"So I'm excited about the process. I'm not where I want to be, not even close, but my goal is to be in midseason form come camp."
The Seahawks are Marshall's sixth team. In addition to his 2010 visit as an RFA with the Denver Broncos, Marshall said the Seahawks had interest in him in 2015 following his three seasons with the Chicago Bears and last year after his two-year run with the Jets ended.
Alluding to a past that includes several run-ins with the law, an NFL and a team suspension as well as a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, Marshall said the screening the Seahawks put him through during his latest visit earlier this month was more intense than the TSA line.
"They did their due diligence, to say the least, and they really broke down everything since I've been in the league, and we had some great conversations, some transparent conversations and some challenging conversations," he said. "I had to answer some tough questions. But I think the biggest thing that they wanted to see was me run around. At this point [in their careers], a lot of guys would say, 'I'm 34 and I'm established. Why do I have to work out?' So I think my workout was good. It wasn't great because of where it was in my rehab process, but I was proud of it. Just two weeks before that workout, three weeks before that workout was the first time I was able to even get on the field and run full routes pain-free."
Marshall felt so good about his workout that he bought some Seahawks apparel at the airport on his way home. That included the bright green T-shirt he was wearing in the picture he posted to Instagram to announce his deal with the Seahawks.
As for that seaplane in 2010?
"That was fresh off the recruiting trails," Carroll said, "so I think we flew him in, flew him into the dock or something silly like that. It was crazy. We never did it again. But we went all out. It didn't work out. So since then ... we've had our eye on him for a long time because of his style of play. Very aggressive, can be the big receiver in the offense and his playmaking has always been something that we've kept an eye on."
Marshall confirmed that he won't resume his analyst duties on Showtime's "Inside the NFL," citing the long travel between Seattle and New Jersey, where the show is taped. But he may take part remotely on occasion.
"At this point in my career, I'm just focused on going out the right way and being a football player," he said. "Those opportunities will be there when I'm done."
Marshall and the Seahawks hope he's not done just yet.
"He's a big receiver, he's a physical guy, he works well in close areas, working off of defenders and all that," Carroll said. "The fact that he's been a go-to guy in his past, there are those kinds of thoughts out there. We'll see what happens. I don't know. We'll see how he fits in. Really, he's like the rest of the guys. He's got to battle for every step of the way, and he knows that. I was very emphatic about how this is going to work out, and he was fired up about it and ready to go."
Jesus Christ is being removed from a South Carolina church.
A statue of Jesus Christ and accompanying artwork that has been displayed at Red Bank Baptist Church for more than a decade will be taken down by Thursday, according to church officials.
The art will be removed because a majority of the congregation voted that the 7-foot-tall statue and sculpted reliefs were "causing some confusion."
According to the church, many people think the sculptures are Catholic and not representative of a Baptist church.

"We have discovered that there are people that view the art as Catholic in nature. We understand that this is not a Catholic icon, however, people perceive it in these terms," said a letter that was signed by Dr. Jeff Wright, Red Bank's senior pastor, and Mike Dennis, the church's Chairman of Deacons.
The letter was sent to Bert Baker Jr., the Midlands artist who hand carved the statue for the church in 2007. Baker is a former member of the Red Bank Baptist Church congregation.
"I'm not interested in stirring the pot, but people not liking it because it looked too Catholic is crazy, man. It's been up there for 11 years," Baker told The State on Tuesday. "I don't agree with the letter, it bothers me."
Both the church's letter and a two-page response from Baker were shared on Facebook by Rhonda Davis. Like Baker, Davis is unhappy with the church's decision to remove the art.
In her Facebook post, Baker called the art "a wordless story of Christ's life, death and resurrection." She said its removal is sad and regretful because it "insults and prejudices" another denomination, which she described as "totally unbecoming of anyone who calls themselves a representative of Christ."
"It is both disturbing and sad that in a time when we are all needing to come together as brothers and sisters in Christ to project and reflect His love to a lost and dying world, Red Bank has decided to single out another denomination as the reason behind the decision to avoid any real or imagined fear that they would somehow be associated with them," Davis wrote in her Facebook post.
In his letter, Baker echoed those sentiments.
"These sculptures have been gracing the front of RBBC for 11 years and at no time then or now has anyone ever been 'confused' as to who Red Bank Baptist is nor has anyone ever suggested that they are 'Catholic' in nature," Baker wrote. "I am stunned that your letter both insults the intelligence of the Red Bank Community (as not intelligent enough to know that Red Bank Baptist Church is a Baptist church despite having a large sign stating as much); and, more disturbing, singling out the Catholic church in such a manner as to suggest that their denomination is deficient in theology and lacking in Christian core values."
In the church's letter, it offered Baker the opportunity to remove the sculptures if he desired to keep them, adding: "The art needs to be removed by May 31, 2018."
Baker said he hopes the statue and artwork are not destroyed — but instead given to another church or sold, with money raised to support missionary work.
"I was commissioned to make the sculpture, and whatever they choose to do with it is their prerogative," Baker told The State. "I just didn't want it destroyed. I don't want to take it down personally, but I hope they find another place for it."
Baker said he knows there are other churches that have reached out about acquiring the art, but he has not heard from the church beyond the original letter.
Messages left with the church were not answered.
Scientists expect this year's summer Chesapeake Bay hypoxic or “dead zone” – an area of low to no oxygen that can kill fish and aquatic life – will be larger than average, approximately 1.89 cubic miles, or nearly the volume of 3.2 million Olympic-size swimming pools.
Measurements for the Bay's dead zone go back to 1950, and the 30-year mean maximum dead zone volume is 1.74 cubic miles.
“Despite this year's forecast, we've made great strides in reducing nutrient pollution from various sources entering the Chesapeake Bay, and we are starting to see positive long-term signs,” said Rob Magnien, director of NOAA's Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research. “However, more work needs to be done to address nonpoint nutrient pollution from farms and other developed lands, to make the Bay cleaner for its communities and economic interests.”
The anoxic portion of the zone, which contains no oxygen at all, is predicted to be 0.35 cubic miles in early summer, growing to 0.49 cubic miles by late summer – both of which are at or slightly above average. Above average nutrient loading from the Susquehanna River this spring accounts for the overall slightly larger-than-average predicted size of the anoxic portion.
The Bay's hypoxic (low-oxygen) and anoxic (oxygen-free) zones are caused by excess nutrient pollution, primarily from human activities such as agriculture and wastewater. The excess nutrients stimulate an overgrowth of algae, which then sinks and decomposes in the water. The resulting low oxygen levels are insufficient to support most marine life and habitats in near-bottom waters, threatening the Bay's crabs, oysters and other fisheries.
Spring rainfall plays an important role in determining the size of the hypoxic zone. In 2017, the Susquehanna River delivered 81.4 million pounds of nitrogen into the bay slightly greater than the long term average. Rainfall amounts were greatest in New York and Pennsylvania, leading to higher than average streamflow into the Bay from the Susquehanna.
The Bay outlook is based on models developed by NOAA-sponsored researchers at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science and the University of Michigan. They rely on nutrient loading estimates from theU.S. Geological Survey. Throughout the year, researchers measure oxygen and nutrient levels as part of the Chesapeake Bay Monitoring Program, run by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. This year's findings will be released in the fall.
“The USGS supports this forecast by calculating nutrient loads based on its streamflow gauges and water-quality sampling sites,” said Don Cline, associate director for the USGS Water Mission Area. “The USGS and Maryland have maintained a monitoring partnership for over thirty years in order to track conditions in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. These data are all publicly accessible at waterdata.usgs.gov.”
NOAA also tracks surface dissolved oxygen levels through its Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System; near-real-time data from 10 locations around the Bay is available at www.buoybay.noaa.gov.

ISLAMABAD, Feb 15 (APP): Eleven members of Asian Organization
of Supreme Audit Institutions (ASOSAI) held 51st Governing Board
Meeting at Bali, Indonesia to discuss the outcomes of strategic
development.
The meeting was opened by the Chairman of Indonesia's Supreme
Audit Agency (BPK) Harry Azhar Azis and was attended by Pakistan,
Indonesia, India, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Saudi Arabia,
Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam, as well as audit committees from
Jordan and Mongolia; and observers from China, INTOSAI Development
Initiative, and ASEAN Supreme Audit Institutions (ASEANSAI), according to a press release received here on Wednesday.
The meeting discussed the preparation of 2018-2020 multi-year
budget, ASOSAIs capacity building report, progress of 2016-2021
strategic achievement report, journal, as well as the cooperation
of ASOSAI with regional organizations and reports from the ASOSAIs
working groups and committees.
The Auditor General of Pakistan Rana Assad Amin represented
Pakistan in the meeting.
Pakistan is an active member of the ASOSAI Governing Board
and Capacity Development Committee.
As a member of ASOSAI Governing Board, Pakistan plays a
strategic role in creating the policies and determining ASOSAIs
strategic decisions.
Rana Assad Amin presented reports on three agenda items of
the meeting, report on the activities of International Organization
of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), 11th ASOSAI Research
Project `Audit of PPP arrangements and recognition of Economic
Co-operation Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (ECOSAI) as
a regional sub-group of ASOSAI
The AGP also took up case with the Governing Board members
regarding the recognition of ECOSAI as a regional group of ASOSAI.
With the recognition of ECOSAI as a sub-group of ASOSAI, it
is expected that the ECOSAI member will benefit from the support
provided by ASOSAI.
Besides, three ECOSAI members i.e. Turkmenistan, TRNC and
Uzbekistan who are presently not members of ASOSAI, can also be
motivated to join ASOSAI and later INTOSAI.
This year, ASOSAI will choose its chairman for the period
2021-2024 and secretary general for the period 2018-2021.
During last year's Governing Board Meeting, ASOSAI had
specified the draft of the ASOSAI 2016-2021 Strategic Plan,
covering capacity building programme for its members, research
and development through E-learning, knowledge exchange, as well
as implementation of monitoring mechanism and evaluation.
Scion is no more. Dead. Fin. We've seen this coming for years, but if we're being honest, everyone should have seen it from day one. On Scion's first official day of sales, in 2003, it sold a car called the xA. And the xA can explain the death of Scion, more than 12 years later.
I know it sounds absurd that a 12-year-old car, produced for only two years, could be responsible for the death of an entire brand. It's not like all of Scion's managers were mowed down by unintentionally-accelerating xAs, however much they may or may not have deserved it. It's what it represented.

CHARLOTTE, Mich. (AP) — A father of three victims of Larry Nassar rushed and tried to attack the disgraced former sports doctor on Friday during a sentencing hearing in Michigan, after the judge declined his request for "five minutes" alone with Nassar in a locked room. He was quickly tackled by bailiffs.
Two of the man's daughters had just told the judge they and another sister had been sexually abused by Nassar under the guise of medical treatment. Their father, Randall Margraves, later addressed the court, telling the judge he was a "distraught father."
Margraves looked at Nassar, shook his head and called him a profanity while speaking at the courtroom podium. The judge cautioned Margraves against using such language. He then asked for "five minutes" alone with Nassar. The judge said she couldn't allow that. Margraves asked for one minute, but she again declined.
The father then lunged at Nassar, who was sitting nearby.
Crying could be heard in the courtroom as Nassar was escorted out. Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis told families in the courtroom to "use your words," not physical violence.
"This is letting him have this power over us," she said. "We cannot behave like this. I understand this is a remarkable situation. But you cannot do this. This is not helping your children. This is not helping your community. This is not helping us."
The incident occurred during the third and final sentencing hearing for Nassar on sexual abuse charges. The charges in this case focus on his work with Twistars, an elite Michigan gymnastics club. The judge resumed the hearing after about 25 minutes.
More than 30 victims have given statements so far during the hearing, which began Wednesday and resumed Friday morning.
During a similar hearing that ended last week, more than 150 girls and women came forward to say Nassar abused them under the guise of medical treatment while he worked with Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics. He was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison in that case. He had already been sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges.
Earlier Friday, the judge opened the hearing by saying controversial comments made by one of Nassar's attorney the previous day were "unfortunate." The lawyer, Shannon Smith, told radio station WWJ that she had doubts about the large number of women and girls who say they are victims.
Judge Janice Cunningham said Friday that Nassar didn't authorize the statements and has disavowed them. Cunningham said was unfortunate Smith made the comments during the sentencing proceedings.
"What is relevant is for the court to hear each individual story and how the criminal actions of the defendant impacted each individual's life," Cunningham said.
More victims were expected to speak Friday. The proceedings are likely to extend into next week.
Something Else by The Cranberries is a strange sort of greatest hits compilation. On one hand, it does collect the Irish band's most popular songs, dutifully released to mark the 25 years since their first formal musical release: the ethereal, fresh-faced 1992 single “Dreams”. But Something Else isn't a mercenary cash grab, bloodlessly assembled to fulfill a contractual obligation. For one, it features three brand-new songs. Every old song on it was also re-recorded in 2016 acoustically and with string accompaniment (provided by the Irish Chamber Orchestra). Rather, Something Else is a veteran band's attempt to celebrate their own canon by reimagining and extending it.
The Cranberries' awareness of their history is evident from the project's very packaging. The title Something Else calls indistinctly back to the quietly assured question posed by their debut, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, while its cover features the band in a familiar pose. These gesture at a back-to-basics approach, but they are also light-touch engagements with The Cranberries' storied legacy. The same can be said of the band's approach to the actual music on Something Else: None of the hits have been significantly re-arranged or remixed, which will be a relief to Cranberries purists. It's undeniable that strings and the lack of electric guitar make the songs sound different, but not as much as you might think. Although an orchestra presents opportunities for grand flourishes and acoustic guitar often pares a song down to its barest essentials, when employed together, they largely cancel out each other's revisionist potential.
This is also because the songs chosen for Something Else lend themselves to orchestral and/or acoustic reimagining. While The Cranberries' previous and only conventional greatest hits album, Stars: The Best of 1992-2002, showcased the band's rockier side with tracks like “Salvation” and “Promises”, the only heavy song on this project is (obviously) “Zombie”. On Something Else, the swooping strings and finger-plucked guitars supply “Zombie” a somber gravitas that the grungy, stricken, and occasionally grating original never offered. It's a mood that feels apt for reflection on the Troubles in Ireland, two decades on.
The clarity created by strings and acoustic guitar, however, sometimes makes the music come off more mannered than is typical for The Cranberries, wiping away the dreamy haze that so often permeated their earlier work. The songs with perkier melodies, such as “Just My Imagination” and “Dreams”, escape this effect. Some of that brittleness also stems from Dolores O'Riordan's voice, which is certainly less elastic than when she was younger. Her yodeling on “Dreams” is more measured and more liable to give way to gasping, and the thinness of her voice dilutes the anxious energy of “Animal Instinct”.
But O'Riordan has lost neither her Irish lilt, nor the articulated curlicues in her voice that will be warmly recognizable to any longtime Cranberries listener. She sounds invigorated on “Just My Imagination”, and on “Free To Decide”, she doubles down on her old indictment of the paparazzi with the wryly altered line “Harassment's not my forte/ But you do it bloody well.” In the press release accompanying Something Else, O'Riordan commented that she likes these new, re-recorded versions of The Cranberries' oeuvre better: “I prefer them like this, with a little bit more experience behind them, with a new lease of life.” And the songs do hold up, showing their age only when their lyrics are specific to a fault (see the charmingly juvenile lines of “Ode to My Family”). That The Cranberries' songs are as full of grace and spark years on is testament to the strength of O'Riordan's and Noel Hogan's songwriting. “Linger” is still timelessly beautiful, lent even more sparkle by Hogan's acoustic guitar.
O'Riordan has always treated The Cranberries' music as a vehicle to speak on familial love, as she did on “Ode to My Family” and “You & Me”. She continues to do so on “Why”, which was written a few years ago after her father's death. The poignant new song captures both mourning and yearning, pushing forward through grief where the other morose new additions – “Rupture” and “The Glory” – merely drift and meander. Adding new songs to a supposed greatest hits album is not out of character for The Cranberries. After all, they did not stop making music, together or individually, after their golden period of the '90s; their last album, Roses, was released in 2012. Their decision to sprinkle new material throughout, however, is bold, their implicit assertion of these songs' rightful places alongside longtime favorites up for debate.
In our current age of potently, relentlessly marketed rock nostalgia, some ruthless cynics might even question if this Cranberries project is even necessary. Do we need faithful new versions of old songs, no matter how immaculate the results? It's hard to say without considering one's predisposition to the band in the first place. Some listeners will inevitably pass on Something Else for The Cranberries at their '90s peak, while diehards will undoubtedly rejoice at hearing the band in action again, and with new material to boot. If you're caught in between, you are, as O'Riordan would say, free to decide for yourself.

Paris: The doctrine of nuclear deterrence, put to the test in the standoff between Washington and Pyongyang, dates to the Cold War when the world's two superpowers seemed hellbent on “mutually assured destruction”.
The arms race between US and the then Soviet Union saw a proliferation of nuclear warheads as well as their vectors—missiles, planes and submarines.
On the eve of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, the Soviet arsenal boasted some 37,000 warheads, compared with nearly 22,000 warheads in the US, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS).
Today, thanks to a series of multi-lateral and bilateral treaties, those numbers have dropped to around 7,000 and 4,480 respectively—still more than enough to assure nuclear suicide for both sides.
“The nuclear weapon, invented 70 years ago, has shown itself to be an effective means of preventing war since there has been no conflict between major powers since then,” said researcher Bruno Tertrais of the Paris-based Foundation for Strategic Research.
“There has never been open conflict between nuclear powers and no country with nuclear weapons has ever been invaded,” he added in a report.
Similarly, “no country protected by the nuclear umbrella has ever suffered a massive military attack,” he wrote, referring to the 29 member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato).
But critics of the deterrence doctrine reject these arguments, saying it is a theory that cannot be tested.
Moreover, they argue that the inter-dependence of the world's economies and the influence of international institutions have been the overriding guarantors of peace between the big powers since World War II.
The policy has faced two serious tests—the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and a hair-trigger confrontation between India and Pakistan 40 years later.
In 1962, at the height of the Cold War, an American spy plane detected Soviet medium-range ballistic missile installations on the territory of Soviet ally Cuba just miles off the Florida coast.
The Soviet move followed the deployment of US ballistic missiles in Italy and Turkey.
The US president John F. Kennedy responded with a military blockade of Cuba and placed US strategic forces on maximum alert, dubbed DEFCON 2, the level preceding full-out nuclear war.
B-52 bombers were on continuous airborne patrol and dozens of inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) were on ready alert.
Soviet ships laden with nuclear missiles turned back in exchange for a secret agreement by Washington to remove its missiles from Turkey.
Washington also promised not to invade Cuba.
The crisis prompted the BAS to move its “Doomsday Clock” to two minutes before midnight, the closest the world has ever been to global nuclear catastrophe in its estimation.
Four decades later India and Pakistan came to the brink of nuclear war as their decades-old dispute over Kashmir reached fever pitch, with nearly a million soldiers massed on either side of the territory's disputed border. Both became a nuclear power in 1998.
After Pakistan's then president Pervez Musharraf said he was prepared to resort to nuclear weapons against India, India's defence minister told the International Herald Tribune that “he should realise that India can survive a nuclear attack, but Pakistan cannot.”
The two sides began a series of tit-for-tat missile tests before agreeing, under US pressure, to de-escalate tensions.
They reached a ceasefire in November 2003 and started a dialogue the following January.
International relations expert Daniel Vernet, former editor-in-chief of the influential French daily Le Monde, said the crisis involving North Korea illustrates the dangers of nuclear proliferation.
“Dissuasion worked as long as there were few actors and they were considered rational,” he said in a recent op-ed. “Their proliferation increases the possibility for misunderstandings, false interpretations of another's intentions, or unbalanced judgement in autocratic regimes.”
The BAS set its Doomsday Clock to two and a half minutes to midnight in January 2017 partly as a result of a Trump's “comments over North Korea, Russia and nuclear weapons.”
Security beefed up in capital
Islamabad Police have beefed up security in the Capital and special deployment is being made at all important installations, buildings, markets to avert any untoward incident and provide complete security to the citizens.
Following the directions of IGP Islamabad Sultan Azam Temuri, special security plan has been devised by SSP Islamabad Najee bur Rehman Bugvi. This plan, the police source said, includes the deployment of around 1000 policemen at all important installations, parks, markets and other public places.
All four SPs including SP will supervise these security arrangements in their respective areas. Keeping in view the ongoing and expected gatherings in Islamabad during next 2-3 days, reserves and special strength have been provided to police stations for maintaining high alert security.
Four teams of QRF, Commandoes, lady Commandoes and eight teams of mounted police have been constituted for patrolling in the vicinity of Constitution Avenue.
All SDPOs and SHOs will arrange special patrolling in their area and mobile officer will take notice of the suspicious persons and vehicles. All vehicles having tinted glasses or suspicious number plates will be checked thoroughly and their relevant particulars will be noted. Policemen in plain clothes will be deputed for collection of advance intelligence and in case of useful information they will immediately inform to relevant police officials and main police control.
SSP Islamabad has directed all police officials to maintain strict vigilance at all police pickets and entry as well exit points of the city. He also directed to conduct checking at hotels, inn, guest houses and slum areas and launch special crackdown against beggars.
The personnel of Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) have been assigned duties at various points of the city to maintain smooth flow of traffic.—APP
CHARLOTTE, North Carolina, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Hideki Matsuyama bogeyed the first hole to slip one shot behind American Kevin Kisner after the overnight co-leaders finished their first hole of Saturday's third round of the PGA Championship.
World number three Matsuyama, seeking to become the first Japanese male to win a major golf championship, came out of a greenside bunker to within five feet of the cup but needed two putts to get down.
Kisner, looking for his first major title, burned the right edge of the hole with a birdie attempt before tapping in for par.
Australian Jason Day, the 2015 champion, also in the final threesome, parred the first to remain six under par, two strokes behind Kisner.
Tied with Day was American Chris Stroud, who also parred his first.
Moving in the wrong direction was Italian Francesco Molinari, who double-bogeyed the opening hole and bogeyed the second to slide from five-under to two under par.
Also starting the day on five-under was South African Louis Oosthuizen who parred the first two holes, but seemed to hurt himself on a swing standing awkwardly against a tree on the second.
He was carrying on while being attended to by a physio as he walked down the fairway.
Birdies were available in the early going as Friday's rain seemed to have taken some of the fire out of the course, though the greens remained devilishly fast.
Early starter J.B. Holmes posted seven birdies along with three bogeys as he registered a four-under 67 to stand one-over.
As the day wore on the ground firmed up, and the chance of late afternoon thundershowers was in the forecast.
Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas and England's Paul Casey, who began the round on three-under, all bogeyed the first hole to slip to six shots off the pace.
Jordan Spieth's quest to complete the grand slam was almost certainly over, at least for 12 months.
Starting the day 11 shots adrift, he made three bogeys in his first seven holes and, despite a rebound, he was 12 strokes behind Kisner through 13 holes. (Reporting by Larry Fine; Editing by Ken Ferris)

Deputy Minister of Health, Tina Mensah in a handshake with Keller Rinaudo, CEO of Zipline
The Ministry of Health has signed a Letter of Intent with the developer and operator of Unmanned Aircraft Systems, popularly known as drones, to offer a drone-enabled supply chain solution in Ghana that will ensure secure, reliable and timely deliveries of essential health care products to hospitals and other health facilities.
The Service, which will be designed, installed and operated by USA-based Zipline International Inc. in partnership with the Ghana Health Service, will leverage technology to improve the supply chain of critical medical supplies, reduce waste and save lives.
A Deputy Minister of Health, Tina Mensah, signed on behalf of Ghana while Keller Rinaudo, CEO of Zipline, signed for his company in Accra on Monday, 23 April 2018, in the presence of Vice-President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, who has championed the governmental effort to ensure the use of innovation and technology in public service delivery.
Zipline was one of the many companies with cutting-edge technology who met and held discussions with the Vice President and the founders and leaders of a number of Ghanaian ICT firms a few weeks ago during H.E. Dr Bawumia's working visit to Silicon Valley, California, USA.
A number of companies based in the ICT hub of Silicon Valley have also indicated their readiness to explore partnership opportunities with their Ghanaian counterparts after the trip to design and implement Ghanaian solutions for Ghanaian challenges.
Speaking earlier in the day at the 2018 edition of the Ministry of Health and Partners Health Summit, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia had indicated that government was exploring innovative ways, including the use of drone technology, to make universal health care available to every Ghanaian in a timely manner irrespective of location.
According to officials, Ghana will become the first country in West Africa, and the largest in the world, to use such a delivery system when it is fully deployed.
The system can also be employed to deliver other items such as urgent letters, examination papers and election materials such as ballot papers, officials maintain.
Addressing the media after the brief signing ceremony, which was witnessed by officials from the National Blood Bank, Ghana Post and Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, Hon Tina Mensah extolled the virtues of such a system for efficient health care delivery.
“Very soon we will be seeing some drones flying to hitherto hard to reach areas of this country and thereby we will be saving lives. It will have so many uses. For example, when there is an accident somewhere, instead of transporting essential healthcare products by vehicle which would take a lot more time, the drones can just deliver within the shortest possible time, so lives could be saved.”
The Director General of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), Dr. Anthony Nsiah Asare, recounted how this technology has helped in the healthcare delivery systems in Rwanda to the admiration of the global medical field and was optimistic its introduction in Ghana will improve the performance of the GHS.
He called for speedy implementation of the technology for efficient healthcare delivery. Meanwhile, the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority has pledged to create an air corridor for drones to prevent collisions with aeroplanes and other larger aircraft.

While the European Commission aims for sales of fully electric cars to reach a level of 15% by 2025, and 30% by 2030, cost and infrastructure scarcity still a big deciding factor
The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) have revealed a brand-new study, detailing the shortcomings of the EV market across the European Union. According to the study, the affordability of electric cars remains the biggest obstacle for improved adoption rates, while the lacking infrastructure brings on the final nail in the coffin of EV sales across the EU. The analysis compares national data on the uptake of EVs with the country's GDP per capita, giving us a clear-cut connection of PPP (Purchasing power parity) and the stage of development for a particular country, with total EV adoptions rates.
Certainly, this doesn't come as a surprise. However, the market share of EVs being close to 0% in countries with a GDP below €18,000 (~US$21,000) and no more than 0.75% in half of all EU member states, does come as a cold shower for many. Luckily, a shift in the thought process for the EU lawmakers seems to be in sight.
The European Parliament's Committees on industry (ITRE) and transport (TRAN) are set to vote on the European Commission's proposal for the future car and van CO 2 targets on 10 July. While this is a positive step in the right direction, ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers' Association) cautions that the targets set by the European Commission must be realistic, and also, take into account the purchasing power of all EU member states and their people.
The European Parliament mustn't lose sight of the fact that the market is essentially driven by customers. A natural shift to electric vehicles will simply not happen without addressing consumer affordability. —Erik Jonnaert, ACEA Secretary General
While the ability to purchase vehicles in certain areas is the most dominating factor, the availability of the infrastructure is also a big factor in the diminished sales. This goes in line with the findings revealed in the study by ACEA that found some rather compelling numbers: out of roughly 100,000 charging points available across the EU today, a whopping majority of 76% are located in just four countries; Germany, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. On the opposite side of the spectrum, in Romania – which is roughly six times the sizes of The Netherlands – electric car users can rely on just 114 charging points for the entire country. With a population of roughly 19 710 000, this relates to one charger per 172 894 people.
In order to improve sales of EV vehicles and help curb the effect of Co2 emissions, the European Commission has proposed a ‘benchmark' for the sales of fully electric cars; a level of 15% should be reached by 2025, and 30% by 2030. Currently, just 0.7% of total EU car sales in 2017. are accounted towards purely electric vehicles, while electric and plug-in hybrids accounted for just 1.5% of total car sales in the EU. If the current pace of growth would be kept by 2025, the market share of EV and plug-in hybrid vehicles would rise to just 3.9% by 2025 and 5.4% by 2030 – way below the 15% target goal.
We are worried that some policymakers have completely unrealistic expectations regarding the pace of market development. Already with the Commission's current proposal for a benchmark, we would need to jump from less than 1% of battery electric car sales today to 30% in the space of less than 12 years. And the Parliament is proposing even more aggressive targets, going as far as 50%. —Erik Jonnaert
While their study gives out a clear rich versus poor argument, the truth is a bit convoluted. The data is clear on the split between richer and poorer EU markets – electric car sales between Central-Eastern and Western Europe, that is correct, but most importantly, the market is split alongside an evident North-South divide – Italy, Greece, and Spain – as well. Following this, in order to counteract this highly fragmented market and achieve an EU-wide average benchmark of 30% by 2030 of EVs sold as proposed by the Commission, more than 50% of all new cars sold in Western Europe would have to be fully electric during that timeframe.
The auto industry is eager to move as fast as it can towards zero-emission vehicles. There is no doubt that this is the future. But to get there, customers must be convinced that this is the best choice for them; both in terms of affordability and convenience. A natural shift in the market will not happen without addressing these barriers. —ACEA report
Certainly, in the last few months, we have seen numerous initiatives by local and federal governments across the EU making efforts to push more EV sales. However, without a clear plan and strategy, resulting in a clear-cut path towards electrification, the target goal of 30% by the European Commission will be a goal too far away.

Now that Ramadan is over and I'm not batch cooking protein-and-nutrient-rich meals to last throughout the long fasting day, it is back to the regular routine. Which means meal planning. I am trying to be organized and prep meals in advance, like all those parents I read about, with their ordered pantries and sensible diet decisions. When I ask my husband what we should eat for dinner this week, his reaction surprises me. “Where's our meal calendar?” he asks, as if this is a perfectly normal discussion we have every week.
I am trying to be organized and prep meals in advance, but after a month of fasting, I'm feeling a little tapped out of meal ideas, writes Uzma. ( Dreamstime )
I do most of the cooking at home. Not because I am especially good at it, but because of schedule: I get home earlier. He and my two sons do most of the other chores, including bathrooms, vacuuming, and laundry. Since cooking is my domain, I usually inform, not ask, the family about food decisions. But after a month of fasting, I'm feeling a little tapped out of meal ideas. Hence my ill advised couple huddle on the topic. So really I have no one but myself to blame for what comes next. “We need a system,” he says, and I know all bets are off. My husband is a problem solver. It is simultaneously one of his best and worst qualities, depending on what mood I'm in. Today I'm in a, ‘I have 100 errands to run today and making a quick grocery trip for meal ingredients is #75, so don't start with me.'

Usually he's pretty quick on the uptake, but today he has that unmistakable glint in his eyes. Years of experience have taught me that once my husband has decided to come up with a better “system,” there's not much I can do to stop him. The key to a harmonious marriage knows when to get out of your spouse's way. Besides, I'm trying to be a more calm and patient person (one of my Ramadan resolutions) so I don't roll my eyes or sigh. Instead I reach for a piece of paper and quickly draw a weekly meal calendar for breakfast, lunch (kid and adult versions) and dinner. “Why are you writing on a piece of paper?” he asks, appalled. I look down at the back of the school flyer I had just scribbled on. “ … Because I believe in GOOS paper?”
But he has already disappeared upstairs, to find his laptop. “We need to come up with a library of meals,” he says when I follow him a few minutes later. He is seated at his desk, Microsoft Excel open on the screen, busily entering meal data into a downloaded template. Be still my beating heart. My never-ending list of chores foremost in my mind, I leave him to it. Another key to a harmonious marriage is to let the most talented person do the job. Which is how I got out of laundry duty.

A few hours later, a few dozen items crossed off my checklist, I wander past his desk. The spreadsheet is a thing of beauty, multicoloured and multi-layered. He shows me the drop-down menu options, inputted from a master meal library. “We can cross-reference ingredients and come up with a grocery list,” he says, his voice excited. Until he spots my smirk. “You're laughing at me.” Patient. Calm. Supportive. I give him a hug. “This is awesome. But can we please just decide on the meals for the week? I need to take Mustafa to buy a pair of baseball cleats because his feet have grown three sizes since last season.” We hash out the week's menu in five minutes, and he inputs our selection in to the beautiful Excel spreadsheet I know we will never use again. Efficient and organized, that's the Jalaluddin-Merchant household. At least for this week. Email: ujalaluddin@outlook.com
Marzhan Nurzhan has a mission. The 25-year-old from Kazakhstan is rallying global youth to tackle one of the biggest threats to her generation. But time may be running out.
On January 25, partly in response to North Korea's recent weapons tests, international scientists moved the hands of the Doomsday Clock — a symbolic gauge that measures the risk of nuclear war — to 11:58. It's the closest to midnight we've been since 1953.
Midnight represents Armageddon.
Nurzhan has been an international advocate for nuclear disarmament ever since she learned of the impact nuclear weapons had on her country. Two million Kazakhstanis still suffer cancer and birth defects, the fallout from decades of Soviet weapons tests.
While many international organizations are active on nuclear disarmament, advocates like Nurzhan face a major challenge getting ordinary people engaged, especially youth. During the Cold War, public demonstrations against nuclear arms were common. Today, not so much. Increased threats haven't increased public interest, says Nurzhan.
Rob van Riet, peace and disarmament co-ordinator for the World Future Council, says nuclear disarmament “feels too large for a lot of people and they feel powerless.”
Issues like climate change are daunting, but tangible. Ordinary citizens can contact politicians, demanding policies that reduce emissions. More importantly, people have at least some control over their household energy use.
But making superpowers give up their huge arsenals, let alone influencing a rogue state like North Korea, seems unattainable.
Still, Nurzhan and van Riet insist ordinary people can help reduce the global risk of nuclear conflict.
A powerful tool is divestment. The U.S., Russia and China want to upgrade their aging nuclear arsenals, and develop new types of smaller weapons that could be used on the battlefield. The companies that build parts for those bombs are supported by investors like pension funds, and even our personal RRSP funds. We can pressure investors to drop these companies from their portfolios, pushing them to get out of the bomb business.
Canada is uniquely positioned to be a leader in nuclear disarmament. As climate change makes Arctic waters more accessible to submarines, Russia and the U.S. increasingly see the north as a key part of their nuclear strategy, according to van Riet. As a respected Arctic nation, Canada could lead the campaign to make the region a nuclear-free zone.
Likewise, with public pressure, Canada could play a diplomatic leadership role and insist that all nuclear states follow the example of China and India and declare a “no first-use” policy. This would reduce the risk of conventional conflicts escalating into nuclear war.
But if Canada is to be that leader, we have to make it a priority for our government.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been conducting town halls across the country — a great opportunity to raise the issue, notes Douglas Roach, a former Canadian senator and ambassador for nuclear disarmament.
“If he's is not hearing from people, he's going to think people don't care,” Roche pointed out.
The Cold War may be a distant memory, but its terrifying ghost still haunts us. It's time for us to engage again on nuclear disarmament. The clock is ticking.

The Detroit Red Wings will need their younger stars to step up in 2017-18 if the team has any aspirations to once again reach the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and apparently, some of those players got the memo on opening night. Dylan Larkin, Anthony Mantha, and Martin Frk each found the back of the net in Detroit's 4-2 win over the Minnesota Wild on Thursday evening. Henrik Zetterberg, the lone veteran goal scorer for the team, notched the game's go-ahead goal in the third period.
On a night where the Red Wings not only kicked off their 2017-18 season, the organization also began a new chapter in their already storied history by playing the first regular season game inside the impressive Little Caesars Arena. With the weight of the 25-year playoff streak finally lifted and no guarantee of an immediate return to postseason contention, Hockeytown's talented young forwards offered glimpses of hope in an otherwise uncertain future.
While Detroit's overall team performance against the Wild still leaves a lot to be desired in the long-run, winning the inaugural game in their awe-inspiring new home will be something that the players and coaches can certainly build off of. However, the more important fact is that some of the youngest Wings were given the opportunity to shine, and they did not disappoint.
Mantha, Larkin, Frk Combo Clicking
One of the Red Wings' best, if not the best, line combinations this preseason was the group of Frk, Larkin, and Mantha. The trio's chemistry during exhibition play carried over noticeably into the first game of the regular season. Mantha became the first goal scorer in Little Caesars Arena history after slamming home a power-play goal in front of the net near the end of the second period. It was a goal that the 23-year-old winger envisioned scoring earlier in the day:
“I was thinking about it all day,” Red Wings winger Anthony Mantha said. “(Was thinking) it would be fun if I could get the first goal.”
Frk, whose preseason performance earned him a roster spot with the club, tallied his first career goal and assist during his professional debut in Detroit. To make the story even better, it also all occurred on his 24th birthday. It's only fitting that he assisted on Mantha's goal, and likewise, Mantha on his. While his NHL roster spot will be something that the Czech-born winger will have to consistently work for all season long, he's already making some good first impressions.
Not to be outdone, Larkin also scored a goal while the Red Wings were on the man-advantage, and less than thirty seconds after Mantha buried his. Having two of their youngest and most promising stars score quick, back-to-back goals, electrified the crowd at LCA and was warmly welcomed after Detroit's lackluster offensive performance during the 2016-17 NHL season.
The Wings converted on two of their five total power play opportunities, a step in the right direction for a team who finished 27th in the league last season with a 15.1% success rate. With the NHL expected to crack down on slashing and other rule violations in 2017-18, being able to capitalize on special team chances will be an area of focus for every team as the year goes on.
Jimmy Howard Lends a Hand
After much offseason drama and speculation between the pipes for the Red Wings, Howard did his part in helping his team win their first game of the season. Despite facing more shots than his counterpart at the other end of the ice for the entire 60 minutes of play, Detroit's veteran goalie stood on his head and earned his 200th career victory in the process.
After the game, Detroit's head coach, Jeff Blashill, praised his goalie as the difference maker in the contest:
“I thought Jimmy was great all game,” said Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill. “The difference in the game is Jimmy. The 5-on-3 is a big moment. I thought our killers did a great job. “I thought Jimmy was solid all game.”
Like the dynamic players who skate in front of him, the 33-year-old netminder will need to have both a healthy and productive year if the team wants to compete in the postseason next spring. Often plagued by injuries, usually occurring as he's posting all-star like numbers, Howard could find himself solidifying his starting job in net if he is able to remain healthy and consistent.
It was an exciting opening night under the bright and bountiful LED lights in Hockeytown, but there is still a lot of work to be done by a team looking carry on a historic legacy, while simultaneously trying to forge a new identity. Only time and trial will reveal the answers – until then, just enjoy the ride.
AI systems can be trained to help astronomers identify if galaxies are still active in producing new stars, according to a new study published in The Astrophysical Journal.
A team of researchers has built a convolutional neural network to identify galaxies at various evolutionary stages. Galaxies are mostly massive blobs of gas, dust and stars and it can be difficult to study how they evolve over time as it unfolds over billions of years.
Scientists have had to piece together the process by taking snapshots or creating simulations of different galaxies in the past. But the CNN appears to be able to make the right call around 80 per cent of the time.
The rate of star formation in galaxies has been connected to the different life stages of galaxies. Young galaxies are still active and have bright, active stellar nurseries, making them appear blue. Old galaxies, however, have used up their material and rarely produce new stars and are cooler so appear more red.
In simulations of galaxies, gas is funnelled to a central, dense, star formation region called a “blue nugget”. The idea of using colour to study galaxies can be split into three stages.
When a galaxy is in the early stages and star formation has not reached its peak it's called pre-blue nugget. When the galaxy is undergoing active star formation it's considered the ideal blue-nugget stage, and then the post-blue nugget stage comes when star formation has been quenched.

The researchers simulated 35 galaxies in different stages of evolution, but only used 28 in the training process: 24 for training, two for validation, and two for testing. The training process was repeated five times, using two different galaxies as test subjects for each run.
“We stress that we are fully aware that the simulations present many limitations and that they are still very far from capturing all the complex physics of galaxy formation. This is mainly why the present work needs to be considered as a proof-of-concept work in that respect,” the researchers admitted in the paper.
The model reaches an average of about 80 per cent accuracy. The researchers also tested it on real data taken from the CANDELS project (Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey), infrared images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
It found that the galaxy's different phases of ‘blue nuggetness' depends on the mass of its stars. Pre-blue nugget galaxies tend to have stars with lower masses, blue-nugget galaxies have intermediate masses, and post-blue nuggets galaxies are heftier.
“It may be that in a certain size range, galaxies have just the right mass for this physical process to occur," said David Koo, coauthor of the paper and a professor astronomy and astrophysics at University of California, Santa Cruz.
"Deep learning looks for patterns, and the machine can see patterns that are so complex that we humans don't see them. We want to do a lot more testing of this approach, but in this proof-of-concept study, the machine seemed to successfully find in the data the different stages of galaxy evolution identified in the simulations," he said.
The researchers hope that deep learning will help astronomers analyse the huge datasets from coming from the Large Synoptic Survey and the James Webb Space Telescope in the future. ®

MINNEAPOLIS >> Ray Lewis and Brian Urlacher terrorized opposing offenses from the middle of the field. Randy Moss and Terrell Owens did the same to defenses on the outside.
The two hard-hitting linebackers and two big-play receivers highlighted an eight-person class voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday. Safety Brian Dawkins also received at least 80 percent support from the 47 Hall of Fame voters, along with contributor Bobby Beathard and senior nominees Jerry Kramer and Robert Brazile.
But the biggest stars of the class are the two linebackers that made it on their first tries, and the pair of lightning-rod receiver who sometimes caused as many problems for their own teams as for the opposition. Moss also made it on his first try, while Owens needed to wait for his third year on the ballot to get enough support.
Ive been going a long time. And now I can finally rest, Lewis said. I want to go fishing with a cigar now and just sit back. I dont want to work out every day now.

Moss and Owens each played for five teams in their careers as they often wore out their welcome with their inability to get along with teammates and coaches at times.
But at their best, there were few players ever able to strike fear in defenses as much as Moss and Owens, who were both all-decade selections for the 2000s.
The door knocked and I started getting excited, Moss said of Hall of Fame President David Baker alerting him he has been elected. All the emotions caught the best of me because its been a long journey and it ends in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Tears of joy.
Moss burst on the scene as a rookie in Minnesota in 1998 when he caught a league-leading 17 TD catches and helped lead the Vikings to the NFC title game. His combination of speed and athleticism made him the games most dangerous big-play threat and led to the phrase You got Mossed for embarrassed defensive backs.
He led the NFL in TD catches five times, including his record 23 for New England in 2007, and earned four All-Pro selections. He finished his career with 982 catches for 15,292 yards and ranks second all-time with 156 TD receptions.
Owens, who didnt attend the announcement, entered the league as a third-round pick by San Francisco in 1996 but developed into a star known for some memorable playoff appearances, including his winning 25-yard TD catches to beat Green Bay in 1999; his 177 yards in a comeback win against the Giants in 2003; and his nine catches for 122 yards in the 2004 Super Bowl against New England just seven weeks after breaking his leg.
Owens ranks second to Jerry Rice with 15,934 yards receiving and is third on the all-time touchdowns receiving list with 153.
Lewis is widely considered one of the greatest middle linebackers, winning two AP Defensive Player of the Year awards and earning eight All-Pro selections. He anchored a dominant defense for the 2000 Baltimore Ravens in a season that ended with him winning Super Bowl MVP, then retired as a champion after Baltimore closed his last season with a title win over San Francisco in February 2013.
Growing up as a child, I know what that looked like, Mike Singletary, Dick Butkus, Lewis said. Who dreams of being in that category, sitting with those guys?
Lewis joined tackle Jonathan Ogden as the only Ravens voted into the Hall of Fame as both of the teams first-round picks in its initial season of 1996 received the high honor.
Lewis career was also marked by legal problems off the field. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of justice after initially being charged with murder in connection with two killings following a Super Bowl party in Atlanta in January 2000. Lewis was also fined $250,000 by the NFL.
Urlacher wasnt far behind Lewis with his play on the field and is the latest in a line of great Chicago middle linebackers to make the Hall, joining Butkus, Singletary and Bill George. He was the Defensive Player of the Year of 2005 and joined Lewis on the 2000s all-decade team.
Dawkins spent most of his 16-year career in Philadelphia, earning five first-team All-Pro selections for his versatility that included 37 career interceptions and 26 career sacks. He became the first player in NFL history with a sack, interception, fumble recovery and touchdown catch in the same game against Houston in 2002.
Kramer got passed over 10 times previously as a finalist before finally getting enough votes as a senior to become the 14th member of the Vince Lombardi Packers to make the Hall. Kramer helped anchor the Green Bay line for 11 seasons, winning six NFL titles and making the block that cleared the way for Bart Starrs TD sneak in the Ice Bowl for the 1967 NFL championship.
Brazile was a finalist for the first time after a 10-year career for the Houston Oilers that included five straight All-Pro selections.
Beathard, also not on hand Saturday, helped build four Super Bowl champions in Miami and Washington and made seven trips to the title game during more than three decades as a personnel executive with a sharp eye for talent.
Five offensive linemen were among the 15 finalists, with tackle Joe Jacoby getting eliminated in voting that reduced the candidates to 10, and tackle Tony Boselli, guards Alan Faneca and Steve Hutchinson, and center Kevin Mawae getting cut in the next round of voting.
Cornerback Ty Law also made it to the final 10 in his second time on the ballot. Defensive backs John Lynch and Everson Walls, receiver Isaac Bruce and running back Edgerrin James were the other candidates eliminated in the first cuts.
Im glad I didnt have to vote for this class, Urlacher said. Its a great class.

VANDALIA — Many Vandalians believe that if it wasn't for Bruce Sucher, the Vandalia Recreation Center might not exist. On Thursday, the city bestowed a rare honor – naming that center after Sucher.
Dozens of family and friends attended the ceremony in the lobby of the center where a plaque with Sucher's likeness, and a record of his contributions to the city, are memorialized.
His contributions were many.
Sucher was hired as a police officer in Vandalia in 1976 and served in various capacities, including Assistant to the City Manager, Deputy Police Chief, Police Chief, and ultimately City Manager in 1988 where he served 16 years until his retirement in 2004. In 2014, Sucher began serving on the Vandalia-Butler Board of Education, and, ultimately, its President until his unexpected death in March, 2017.
It was during the stint as City Manager where the building that now bears his name became reality.
Mayor Arlene Setzer recalls that it was Sucher's vision, along with attention to detail, that allowed the city to face and overcome the challenges.
“There were many ups and downs when building the Rec Center but he stayed the course,” said Setzer. “He was Mr. Vandalia. Bruce had a lot of passions about a lot of things, but the Rec Center was his baby.”
Larry Taylor, co-owner of Beau Townsend Ford and a member of the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, puts it more succintly.
“I don't believe we would have a Recreation Center if it wasn't for Bruce,” said Taylor.
It was Taylor who wrote a letter to Vandalia's City Council requesting they consider renaming the Recreation Center. A committee was appointed to consider the matter and council unanimously approved their recommendation to honor Sucher last June.
“Bruce has given his life to this town,” wrote Taylor. “He loved it (Vandalia) with every fiber of his being. He was a phenomenal man.”
During the renaming ceremony, Vandalia's Communications Manager Rich Hopkins read a statement from Sucher's family expressing gratitude for the honor.
“Surrounded by the community, family, and friends, if Bruce were here today, he would humbly convey his deep appreciation for Vandalia's citizens and local city officials,” the statement read. “When discussing the role of this pivotal establishment, Bruce would express that one of his overarching goals was to create a place where people of all ages could meet, thrive, and be an integral part of Vandalia's uplifting climate.
“He would also share that some of his personal moments of joy were centered around recreation, an aspect that in conjunction with unconditional love, deeply connected his family. Moreover, Bruce would ensure that everyone here today left with an undeniable feeling of gratitude for presenting him with this honor, and he would instill his anticipation for the public to continue relishing in what Vandalia has to offer, while encouraging the continual growth of this great city.”

“I'm a white Jewish man. So I strongly believe that white people in particular have a responsibility to stand up against bigotry because bigotry thrives on silence,” he told The Associated Press. “It requires good people standing by and doing nothing.”
A Twitter account dedicated to calling out racism identified people who attended the rally using photos culled from the news and social media and listed their places of employment and other information. The account with the handle YesYoureRacist was created by Logan Smith of Raleigh, North Carolina, who said his followers grew from around 64,000 on Saturday to more than 300,000 Monday afternoon.
But the Facebook post wasn't circulated by law enforcement in the search for a suspect or by relatives looking for a missing loved one. It was an example of ordinary people trying to harness the power of social media to identify and shame the white nationalists who attended last weekend's violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
NEW YORK—One of the social media posts resembled a wanted poster or a missing-persons flyer: Photographs of men were arranged in rows, seeking their names and employers.
James Alex Fields Jr., man accused of ramming car into Charlottesville protesters, previously accused of beating mother
A website created Sunday dedicated itself to collecting the names, social media profiles, colleges and employers of people photographed at the rally. At least one person has lost his job as a result.
Together, the efforts showed that angry online groups can be used to renounce racism as well as promote it.
“The goal with online shaming is very short term and driven by people's desire to feel as if they are fighting back and having an impact,” said Brian Reich, who's written several books on digital communications, behaviour and political influence. “They are afraid, appalled and they want to stop it.”
But is it helpful? Reich said those behind these efforts “are arguably fanning the flames,” giving attention to a group — white supremacists — that feeds on attention.
THE END OF ANONYMITY?
Nicholas Brody, professor of communications at the University of Puget Sound, said the events show that in the age of social media, “nothing is really anonymous anymore.”
People attending a white supremacist rally decades ago may have had the comfort of knowing that their schools, employers and disapproving family members probably wouldn't find out about their activity.
These days, not only can information be quickly and widely shared, but a lot of data is available about people on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Image searches and facial-recognition technology, meanwhile, can make it relatively easy to identify people online. Smith said he called out the people pictured in photos from the rally through a combination of tips from former classmates and others and online sleuthing.
But the method isn't foolproof. In 2013, users of Twitter and the website Reddit wrongly accused a man of being a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing. Reddit later apologized.
COLLEGE STUDENT IS EXPOSED
Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old college student, was photographed shouting with a group of torch-wielding protesters Friday during a march through the University of Virginia campus. Cvjetanovic said in a television interview that he didn't expect the photo to spread as widely as it did.
But spread it did. And thousands of people signed an online petition to have him kicked out of school. Cvjetanovic told a local TV station that he is “not the angry racist they see in that photo,” but a white nationalist who cares for all people.
The University of Nevada in Reno confirmed Monday that Cvjetanovic is a student there. Spokeswoman Kerri Garcia said the university is “still monitoring the situation and reviewing information.”
A message left for Cvjetanovic through the school was not returned. There was no telephone listing available for him in Reno.
Meanwhile, Top Dog, a hotdog company in the San Francisco area, said one of its employees resigned after being confronted by management about participating in the rally.
‘DOXING' AS INVITATION TO VIOLENCE
The practice of publishing private or identifying information — such as an address or phone number — about people online in an attempt to hurt, shame or abuse them is known as “doxing.”
In the 1990s, anti-abortion hackers infamously exposed abortion providers' home addresses, photos and other information on a now-defunct website called the “Nuremberg Files.” Names that were greyed out indicated people who had been “wounded.” A strikethrough meant they had been killed.
Collecting and posting publicly available information, such as a photo of a person attending a public protest, is not the same thing, even if that can still hurt or shame people.
Paul Levinson, a communications professor and social media expert, called it a “moral obligation” to expose white supremacists for who they are, something for which social media provides a good opportunity.
Gordon Coonfield, communications professor at Villanova University, said there is an important difference in the reasons people get doxed.
“Doxing an advocate of racial equality is an implicit — and often explicit — call for violence against them,” he said in an email. “Doxing a white nationalist is a call for accountability. Compelling individuals to be accountable for their words and deeds online or off is not a threat to freedom of expression. It is the foundation of freedom of expression.”
Case in point, Smith said, he has received many death threats because of his Twitter posts, so he's going to consider whether to continue.
“They got ahold of all my personal info and have been threatening me and my family and even my wife's family,” he said.
Of course, mere presence at a rally does not imply willing participation. Tiki Brand Products, whose torches were used and widely photographed during the rally, took to Facebook to distance itself from the march.
“We do not support their message or the use of our products in this way,” the company wrote on its Facebook page. Our products are designed to enhance backyard gatherings and to help family and friends connect with each other at home in their yard.”

Officials have widened the highway, raised half of it and are in the process of raising the other half, said Lee Dragna, drainage district chairman.

Bryan Habana had the speed and skill to evade trouble and wreak havoc on a rugby field‚ but ultimately he couldn't outpace age and injuries‚ which forced him to call time on his career on Tuesday.
Habana‚ 34‚ announced that when the current French domestic season ends in June‚ he would retire from all rugby.
The KES boy who fell in love with rugby as a spectator at the 1995 Rugby World Cup final would eventually make his own mark on the tournament and become South Africa's greatest wing.
"The inevitable moment has come knocking on my door and I've welcomed it in for a drink‚” Habana posted on social media.
"It's been more than a year of hoping‚ trying‚ pushing and willing to get back on the field for one last time‚ to taste the sweet victory or encounter that gut-wrenching despair.
"To hear the roar of the crowd or grab the pill out of the air. To make that last bone crunching tackle or score that last game-winning try.
"But it's unfortunately just not to be. I‚ like most‚ would have liked my career to have ended differently‚ but sometimes things don't turn out quite the way we hope for."
Habana started rugby life as a scrumhalf before making it into the pro ranks as a centre for the Lions.
He was selected as a centre for the SA Under-21 team in Scotland in 2004‚ but was moved to wing for their third Pool game against New Zealand. Habana scored a hattrick in a 46-27 defeat.
Later that season‚ Jake White‚ Bok coach at the time‚ picked Habana from nowhere to be part of a Bok training squad for the Tri-Nations.
A few months later Habana was capped for the first time against England at Twickenham.
He came off the bench and scored a scorching try to announce his arrival on the world stage. Another 66 Test tries and 123 caps would follow.
For the past two years Habana has struggled to remain a first choice player at club Toulon while he also never gave up hope at one more tilt at playing for his beloved Springboks again.
Habana played the last of his 124 Tests on a fateful November‚ 2016 day in Florence‚ when the Boks lost to Italy for the first time.
Typically‚ in what would be his last outing in green and gold‚ Habana scored his 67th and final Test try. Equally typically he would've traded any personal glory for a Bok win.
In retrospect it was an ignominious way to sign off what had been a stellar Test career that made Habana the most sought after property in world rugby at one stage.
Before that match Habana spoke passionately about his love of the game and of the Boks‚ but also of the pressure he was under at Toulon to play more rugby for the club that was paying him a princely wage.
“When I first moved to Toulon they new that I still wanted to play for the Springboks‚ which I stipulated in my contract‚” Habana said on the eve of the Florence Test.
“Toulon are a little unhappy with me. Over the past four years I have missed about 32 games due to my Springbok commitments. I understand their frustration because I'm never involved in the first part of the season.”
Since then Habana has stayed loyal to Toulon as former Bok coach Allister Coetzee looked to locally-based players.
Bryan Gary Habana‚ named after Manchester United legend Bryan Robson‚ became world rugby player of the year in 2007 after scoring eight tries at the World Cup in France.
His scoring exploits‚ which included a brace in the semi-final against Argentina‚ was a huge factor in the Springboks' march to the world title.
Habana played two more World Cups‚ and holds the record for most tries at the tournament with 15‚ which he shares with the late Jonah Lomu. A hattrick against the USA at the 2015 tournament equalled Lomu's record.
His 67 Test tries are also a record by a tier one Test player‚ three more than Australia's David Campese and only two short of the overall record of 69 held by Japan's Daisuke Ohata.
“We have been privileged to have witnessed the career of Bryan Habana‚ who will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the great legends of Springbok rugby‚” said SA Rugby president Mark Alexander. “During a career that spanned more than a decade and a half‚ he stood out as one of the most professional players ever to don the Springbok jersey‚ and over the years Bryan has been central to many of the most memorable occasions in the era of professional rugby.”

North Korea has warned against plans by the United States to resume joint war games with South Korea following the Winter Olympics, insisting in an official letter to the United Nations that it will not “sit idle” in response.
Whenever joint military drills took place, “the peace and security of the Korean peninsula were gravely threatened and the inter-Korean mistrust and confrontation reached the top, thus creating great difficulties and obstacles ahead of hard-won dialogues,” read the letter, penned by North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, media reported on Friday.
“We will make every effort to improve inter-Korean relations in future, too, but never sit idle with regard to sinister act of throwing a wet blanket over our efforts,” he said.
Washington and Seoul earlier agreed to delay their annual joint war games in the region until after South Korea hosts the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, which will start next week.
Ri further said in the letter that Washington was “misleading” public opinion by claiming that its tough stance against the North was responsible for bringing about the inter-Korean talks.
“The fact that a dramatic turning point has been made for peace and stability, national reconciliation and cooperation, and reunification on the Korean Peninsula where a touch-and-go war danger was prevailing is entirely thanks to the noble love for the nation by respected Comrade Kim Jong-un,” he said in the letter, referring to the North Korean leader.
The US special envoy on North Korea, Joseph Yun, had said on Thursday that all options remained on the table for resolving the crisis over the North's weapons programs and that he did not believe Washington was about to provoke military action.
Pyongyang has not tested a missile since last November and entered into dialog with South Korea in January.
The talks between the two Koreas came after year-long tensions between Pyongyang and Washington, during which the two exchanged threats of military attacks, much to the fear of South Korea, which worries possible reprisal attacks on its territory if the US invades the North.
The overture by the North to start dialog with the South confused the US, which first attempted to downplay the inter-Korean talks but then sought to take credit for them.—Agencies
The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation says a body found in Webster County is that of a missing Fort Dodge woman.
The DCI says an autopsy confirmed the body found near Clare is 26-year-old Jessica Lyne Gomez. The Webster County Sheriff's department said last week it was searching Gomez and 26-year-old Mackenzie Knigge of Clare.
Knigge was found last Thursday in Indiana and is now one of two people charged with first-degree murder in Gomez's death. The other person charged is 25-year-old Phillip Williams of Lafayette, Indiana.
Williams and Knigge are being held in the Tippecanoe County Sheriff's Office in Lafayette, Indiana waiting to be brought back to Iowa. No other details on the crime were released.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian stocks are expected to erase recent losses and rise a little this year, but an array of political developments at home and overseas along with just a steady economic growth outlook will likely restrain the market, a Reuters poll showed.

While the Indian stock index gained nearly 7 percent in January and hit a lifetime high, it is down about 4 percent since then, tracking the rout in global equities as worries of a trade war between the U.S. and China intensified.
The consensus from the latest Reuters poll of over 50 strategists and brokers taken May 21-30 points to gains for the BSE Sensex .BSESN.
The index, which is up 2.6 percent for the year, is now expected to gain 1.7 percent from Tuesday's close to 35,550 by end-2018. It is then forecast to hit a fresh record high of 36,300 by the middle of next year.
But over a third of respondents forecast the index to be lower then, including one strategist who expects it to dip to 27,500, a level not seen since January last year.
The consensus view is also the weakest six-month outlook since at least the financial crisis and is also a slight downgrade compared to three months ago.
A majority of poll respondents attributed their views to national election results or political developments outside the country.
More than half the losses so far this year have come after an inconclusive Karnataka state election earlier this month. That has also coincided with the turmoil in global financial markets amid the political chaos in Italy.
“Ahead of the next year's general election and ongoing global political uncertainties, the stock market will not show any large up or down move, remaining consolidated,” said Vedant Manore, a consultant and trader at ‎Edelweiss Financial Services.
“But, if the (current) government wins the majority of seats in Parliament, stock prices would rally on hopes of quick policy decisions.”
Indeed, the more tempered view for a market used to double-digit gains in recent years was driven by the political situation in Karnataka which has clouded the outlook for general elections next year.
The surge in crude oil prices, India's biggest import item, has also weighed on stocks as it is inflationary and may push the Reserve Bank of India to raise rates much earlier than previously thought - possibly as soon as August. [RBI/INT]
India's economy probably gained a little momentum in the first three months of 2018 which should ensure that it remains the world's fastest growing major economy, a separate Reuters poll showed.
Still, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold $1.4 billion of Indian stocks this month, in line with a wide sell-off in emerging markets, driven by the recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields.
After hitting a 10-year high of 25.69 in January, the BSE Sensex price-to-earnings ratio fell to 23.44 in May - above the long-term average of 18.74, suggesting stock prices are still expensive.

What people are saying about Pusha T's vicious Drake diss track
What people are saying about Pusha T's vicious Drake diss track
In Pusha T's “The Story of Adidon,” a diss track response to Drake's “Duppy Freestyle” (which itself was a response to another Pusha T jab), there's not a lot of innuendo. Pusha suggests that Drake fathered a secret child, talks about Drake's parents' marriage (“You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing, your father walked away at 5, hell of a dad thing”) and intimates the impending death of Drake's producer, Noah “40” Shebib, who has multiple sclerosis (“OVO 40, hunched over like he 80, tick, tick, tick”).
Here, some of the internet's responses to the track.
Shebib notes that, coincidentally, May 30 is World MS Day:
Coincidentally… tomorrow is World MS Day. https://t.co/5ms9IJwV86 — Noah Shebib (@OVO40) May 30, 2018
Fake Diplo (not the DJ, but the account of the Viceland show What Would Diplo Do) got a dig in at Drake's fanbase:

New York Times reporter Astead Wesley agrees:

In a nod to the perceived viciousness of Pusha T's clapback, writer Shea Serrano apologizes in advance:

Journalist and podcast host Touré notes that an upcoming Drake collaboration with Adidas was set to be called Adidon:
Adidon is the name of Drake's upcoming Adidas line and now that name will be associated with this beef and Pusha's monstrous diss track. Pusha has, in effect, screwed up Drake's brand before it came out. — Touré (@Toure) May 30, 2018
ESPN reporter Justin Tinsley thinks Drake will probably come back with a comeback to the comeback (whew!):
Drake is one of the most strategic rappers of all time. No way he played his entire hand with “Duppy.” If anything, that's his “Charged Up.” He has another Big Joker to throw down. Then again, Pusha might as well. I love this. — Justin Tinsley (@JustinTinsley) May 30, 2018
Many people noted the perceived imbalance in disses in “Duppy Freestyle” versus “The Story of Adidon”:
“Duppy freestyle” highlights
– you're not a drug dealer
– you're an approachable guy “Story of Adidon” highlights
– your dad left you at 5
– your mom has never been married
– you impregnated a porn star

DJ Akademiks puts it all into perspective:
BOSTON (Reuters) - A group representing large investors voiced concern that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is undoing protections for shareholders to bring proxy resolutions opposed by management.
Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, said his group disagreed with recent SEC decisions allowing companies including electric utility AES Corp to craft their own rules on the right to call special investor meetings, in place of versions proposed by shareholders.
“AES is playing games with this,” Bertsch said in a telephone interview late on Thursday, adding that existing guidance from the top U.S. securities regulator should have been enough to protect the resolutions.
The council, whose members include big pension funds and asset managers like BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group, raised its concerns to the SEC directly in a Jan. 31 letter seen by Reuters.
Under Chairman Jay Clayton the SEC has taken steps seen as favoring businesses, such as allowing companies to confidentially file paperwork for initial public offerings. Clayton said at a November conference he hoped to reconcile concerns about the cost of shareholder resolutions with the corporate governance improvements they can bring about.
Spokespeople for AES and the SEC declined to comment, and the SEC did not make Clayton available for an interview.
Shareholder resolutions have taken on a new importance as fund firms seek money from investors concerned about climate change and corporate governance. [nL1N1IX15V]
The SEC has already taken steps that could raise the bar for filers, such as allowing more resolutions to be skipped as “ordinary business.” [nL1N1OX1EX]
The AES resolution and a similar one at CF Industries Holdings Inc were filed by independent investor John Chevedden. Both called for shareholders with at least 10 percent of shares to be able to call special meetings, which can put pressure on management.
The companies requested SEC permission to leave the proposals off their proxies. Each company said it planned instead to offer shareholders a resolution to set the special meeting threshold at 25 percent of shares, a higher standard that could protect executives and directors.
The SEC sided with AES in December, and with CF on Jan. 30, saying Chevedden's measures conflicted with the management proposals. A CF spokesman did not respond to messages.
In an interview, Chevedden said shareholders could logically vote for both standards to see which had more support. Now, he said, shareholders would “only get to hear management's side.”
OPINION
It's been more than a half century since America's grade school children learned how to properly fear the nuclear bomb -- and protect themselves from it -- back in the dark daze of the Cold War.
Children of the era learned their self-protection lesson well from the cartoon star of “Duck and Cover,” Bert the Turtle. “Bert is a very, very careful fellow,” the announcer says, as Bert suddenly vanishes inside his shell. All you can see are his eyes peering out.
“When there's danger, this is the way he keeps from being hurt,” the announcer explains. “Sometimes it even saves his life. … We all know the atomic bomb is very dangerous. Since it may be used against us, we must get ready for it, just as we must get ready for the many other dangers that are around us all the time.”
Next, we see real, live children who are just like us. When a warning siren sounds -- or when there is just a terrifying light flash -- the kids know how to duck under their desks and cover the back of their necks with clasped hands, fully aware window glass will be flying when an atomic bomb explodes.
This 1951 movie, a federal Civil Defense Administration production, was created in a studio in New York City's Astoria, Queens -- just a few miles from where young Donald Trump was in kindergarten. Local New York kids all saw the movie's searing, unforgettable lesson; eventually, most kids coast-to-coast saw it too.
On Tuesday, one of those kids, now 71, sat in Bedminster, New Jersey, in the comfort of one of his golf course clubhouses and, repeatedly glancing down at words on a paper, sounded a warning heard “round the world.”
“North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” Glancing down again, he repeated his flammable soundbite to assure the message was received by North Korea's irrational leader, Kim Jong-un, whose regime is reportedly capable of making missile-ready miniaturized nuclear weapons. “And as I said, they will be met with fire, fury, and, frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.”
In the hours that followed, many in the news media began comparing Trump's “fire and fury” threat with what President Harry Truman said in 1945 after Japan refused to surrender after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Truman warned the Japanese that if they didn't surrender, “they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth.”
But the comparison doesn't work -- because Truman was warning the enemy that had attacked America, started the war and been defeated. Also: Defense Secretary James “Mad Dog” Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, has long warned that America cannot launch a pre-emptive military attack capable of preventing North Korea from inflicting horrendous slaughter in South Korea.
As bad as all that was, it got predictably worse: North Korea's leader vowed to attack Guam, where US military is based.
And then came this: Trump officials acknowledged Wednesday that the president had issued his ultimatum without clearing his incendiary words with his team of generals. Trump just dredged up his “fire and fury” words from some very dark place deep inside. For years, Trump has openly (see also: cluelessly) wondered why America bothers to have nuclear weapons if it isn't willing to use them.
The result is that Trump recklessly forced an already horrendous confrontation to a potentially even more calamitous level, one that could cause massive tragedy for both North Koreans and America's trusting allies in Seoul. Wednesday afternoon, Mattis, ever the loyal serviceman, protected his boss's backside by warning Pyongyang to halt its pursuit of a nuclear bomb and not launch any military action “that would lead to the end of its regime and destruction of its people.”
So now the world waits: Before this all ends, the question of whether or not a massive human tragedy occurs on the Korean Peninsula may be decided by the one world figure who never wanted this starring role. China's President Xi Jinping may find the diplo-guts and actual humanity to save Kim and Trump from their excessive selves.
Xi may finally insist that North Korea's only chance for a successful future will begin with China's help, and a world of guarantees -- but only if the North ends its militaristic ways now.
There is only one way that can occur: The world's two most implausible co-protagonists, North Korea's Kim and America's Trump, must (for once!) stifle their nuclear-bombastic urges, duck out of the global spotlight, cover their gilded assets -- and give peace a chance.

NEW DELHI: Congress president Rahul Gandhi today called the bullet train Gujarat is set to get, a "magic train", but he didn't mean it as a compliment.He said it would be a "magic train" because it would never materialise, unless, that is, a Congress government comes to power. The bullet train, a 508-km Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Project, entails an estimated cost of Rs. 1 lakh crore."It should not be called a bullet train. It should be referred to as a magic train. It will never be constructed, if at all it is ever made it is going to be in Congress regime," said the Congress chief speaking in Amethi , his Lok Sabha constituency, where he arrived today on a two-day visit, reported news agency ANI.The Congress president has said in the past that the bullet train project is a misplaced priority for the nation. "Only Modi ji and his suit-boot friends will travel in it," he said, by which he meant the rich people."In 2016, nearly 200 people died in train accidents. My priority would be to utilize such a large sum of money in improving safety, so no one dies in train accidents," he said at an even in Gujarat last December.
If one New Year's celebration wasn't enough for you, the Chinese New Year is right around the corner.

While Pixar made its name with purely original films — “Toy Story,” “Finding Nemo,” “The Incredibles,” etc. — it's also banking on sequels.
The latest, “Cars 3,” races into theaters this weekend. The production company has even more sequels lined up in the future, including another “Cars” installment, a highly anticipated “The Incredibles 2,” and “Toy Story 4.”
Pixar first jumped on the sequel bandwagon in 1999 with “Toy Story 2,” a follow-up to its first movie ever. A third “Toy Story” film came out more than a decade later, when many of the first movie's fans were off to college.
After “Toy Story 3” came the first “Cars” sequel, in addition to a follow-up to “Monsters, Inc.,” “Monsters University,” centering on Mike and Sully and their time studying up scares in college. Most recently, the studio caught back up with Ellen DeGeneres' forgetful fish from “Finding Nemo” with her own sequel, “Finding Dory,” which debuted last summer.
The sequels have, unsurprisingly, proved profitable for Pixar. “Toy Story 3” grossed $1 billion worldwide, compared to the first “Toy Story's” $373 million. “Finding Dory” also grossed $1 billion worldwide, ahead of “Finding Nemo's” still-impressive $940 million globally.
Which Pixar sequel (or prequel, in the case of “Monsters University) is your favorite? Weigh in below!

Synth makers Moog have said Donald Trump‘s new trade deal has placed the company under threat.
Moog have warned new tariffs could result in job losses and force the company to move production of its instruments outside of the U.S. All Moog synths are currently built in their North Carolina factory, but some of their circuit boards are imported from China.
President Trump recently introduced a 25 percent tariff on around $50 billion U.S. worth of Chinese goods, which includes “industrially significant technologies”.
Moog is prepared to fight back and has provided a letter its employees can send to their elected officials.

It won't be quite as special as the show to the south, but the Great American Eclipse will still grace Southwestern Ontario with an impressive astronomical scene.
A solar eclipse on Aug. 21 will offer a rare celestial view as the moon's orbit brings it between Earth and its sun, blocking the sun from view.
This region will see a partial eclipse – where the moon covers about three-quarters of the sun – while Americans between Oregon and South Carolina will get the full treatment.
“It's still an amazing event,” Prof. Jan Cami, director of the Cronyn Observatory at Western University, said of the partial eclipse.
The university is hosting a free viewing party, setting up telescopes on the hill in front of University College to help eclipse-watchers get the best look. It should be visible in London from 1 to 3:40 p.m.
“For pretty much all of the astronomical phenomena that we experience, it's one of those (rare) moments where you actually see what's going on,” Cami said. “You see it with your very own eyes.”
Looking directly at the sun is never smart, but staring straight into that orb in hopes of catching the solar eclipse is especially dangerous, Cami said.
Amateur astronomers can pick up a pair of special eclipse glasses at the Western event, which make it safe to watch the solar scene unfold.
Without protection, the strength of the sun can burn straight through retinas and cause permanent eye damage, even blindness, Cami warned.
Londoners can also enjoy the full effects of the Great American Eclipse -- dubbed so because this eclipse will be fully visible on land only over the United States -- through a live stream broadcast from the “path of totality,” which is the direct swath through the United States where the moon will block the entirety of the sun.
Cami called the total solar eclipse “the most awesome experience I've ever seen.” The temperature drops a few degrees and the sky becomes visibly darker – think twilight – while the sun looks like a glittering diamond, and then a big, black hole.
Most local astronomers are travelling to the United States to get a glimpse of the full effect, Cami added.
In the Cronyn Observatory at Western, a Canada 150 event celebrating the country's astronomical heritage will be unveiled. The partial solar eclipse will also be projected onto a large screen in the observatory, using the facility's powerful telescope.
Astronomers can predict the timing of the solar eclipse down to the second, and they expect the show to be visible starting at 1:07 p.m. on Aug. 21 – as long as it's not raining.

With two days removed from Super Bowl LII, all the off-the-field storylines have already been exhausted. Football is near, and the game is won on the field. Here are five keys for the New England Patriots to beat the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.
1. Utilize No-Huddle Offense
The Eagles have a ferocious pass rush compounded with fast linebackers and a smart, heady safety in Malcom Jenkins in the back end. They have talent and brains and are run by defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, who will surely try to limit the Patriots chances of exploiting bad matchups for them.
So what can the Patriots do? They should go no-huddle. Josh McDaniels loves to run such an offense with Dion Lewis and James Develin out on the field. Develin gives the Patriots an obvious blocking tool to open up lanes in running formations. But the Patriots like to split Develin out on shotgun-spread formations. If a cornerback remains on Develin without switching to guard a wide receiver of tight end, that's an indicator of zone coverage. Brady will pick that apart if he knows what the Eagles are running prior to the snap.
#Eagles allow +18.2% DVOA in plays marked "no huddle" by the NFL's official scorers. That ranks 24th in the league. Eagles allowed -17.2% DVOA (third) on other plays. #Patriots have to speed it up, stop those Eagles DL's from rotating. — Aaron Schatz 🏈 (@FO_ASchatz) January 31, 2018
In just that scenario involving Develin and the unmasking of coverages, Brady can decide which one of his receivers (Rob Gronkowski, Brandin Cooks, Danny Amendola, etc.) will exploit which matchups (depending on man or zone coverage) or if he wants run instead of pass.
Additionally, running an uptempo offense will possibly cause at least some fatigue to the Eagles lightning-quick defense. Look for the Patriots to go to this offense at least a few times during the game.
2. Feed Rob Gronkowski, Dion Lewis
According to FiveThirtyEight the Eagles have fared well against wide receivers, but have struggled mightily versus tight ends and running backs in the passing game.
Some notable Tight Ends vs. #Eagles defense this year Travis Kelce: 8 REC, 103 Yds, 1 TD.
Jordan Reed: (2 Gms): 13 REC, 100 Yds, 2 TD.
Evan Engram: (2 Gms): 13 REC, 132 Yds, 0 TD.
Jimmy Graham: 3 REC, 26 Yds, 1 TD. The #Eagles QBR allowed vs. Tight Ends ranked 28th in the NFL — Ryan Spagnoli (@Ryan_Spags) January 31, 2018
Enter the best tight end of all-time in Rob Gronwkowski, along with one of the league's most versatile running backs in Dion Lewis and the Eagles are in a world of trouble.
Brady will at least look Gronk's way down the seam or off mid-range crossing routes off of play-action passes that could be set up on runs by Lewis.
Lewis will be there to make defenders miss as a short passing game option as well as running to the outside and between the tackles. His versatility makes him dangerous. Super Bowl LI hero James White should also factor into the Patriots' passing plans.
3. Pressure Nick Foles
The Patriots' lack of a consistent pass rush has been well documented since the trade of Chandler Jones, who led the NFL with 17 sacks on the Arizona Cardinals this season.
But the current members of the get-to-the-quarterback crew have a knack for making big plays when the season depends on it. Trey Flowers' 2.5 sack performance in Super Bowl LI is the main exhibit. James Harrison's QB hit and later sack and forced fumble on Blake Bortles in the fourth quarter of the AFC Championship Game is another example.
When the game is on the line in 3rd-and-long situations, Foles will look to stretch the field with deep threats in Alshon Jeffrey and Torrey Smith. One thing that would increase the chances of a sack or bad pass deep that Devin McCourty or Duron Harmon can get under is pressure.
Rookies Deatrich Wise Jr and Adam Butler will also play a role in pass rush, but like Dont'a Hightower in last year's Super Bowl, look for Kyle Van Noy to get a few chances to rush the quarterback from the outside on Sunday.
4. Protect Tom Brady
This one is fairly straightforward, as the only team (the New York Giants) to consistently pressure Brady in a Super Bowl throughout ended up handing the Patriots two huge losses.
The Eagles have the tools necessary to do this. Brandon Graham, Fletcher Cox, Derek Barnett and Chris Long form a formidable pass rush.
However, with the exception of the Week 14 loss to the Miami Dolphins, the offensive line has mirrored the Patriots defense with a similar bend-but-don't-break mentality by allowing some hits on Brady but coming up with enough good blocking on a few drives that define the game for the Patriots.
Obvious passing situations for the Patriots and the Jaguars pass rush was not getting close. Great job by the Patriots O-Line. — Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) January 21, 2018
If they can stand their ground for big chunks, giving Brady ample time to throw, the Patriots will be tough to beat.
5. Stay patient
Yes, the Eagles are riding with Foles at quarterback and their team lacks a certain experience in the Super Bowl that the Patriots have. That being said, at some point the Eagles are going to go on a run. That will probably happen earlier in the game than later. The Patriots always play close Super Bowls during the Brady-Belichick era. So expect the Eagles to find some success in run-pass-options and maybe a few downfield throws before the wheels get in motion for the Patriots defensive plan.
Part of what makes Belichick great is his ability to make adjustments throughout the game. It's almost as if he goes in with pedestrian defensive schemes initially to see how the Eagles attack. Then, after working with Matt Patricia at halftime, the unit looks totally different in the second half. Expect that to happen again.
The same goes for the offense. If Brady gets hit often early looking downfield, expect McDaniels to turn to quick passing to Danny Amendola and the running backs. There are plans for everything the Eagles will throw at the Patriots, they'll just have to stay patient and figure out multiple ways to attack, which they will. They always do.

Nagpur: The Maharashtra government on Wednesday tabled supplementary demands of ₹11,445 crore on the opening day of the monsoon session of the state legislature here in Nagpur.
Since it came to power in October 2014, the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has so far raised supplementary demands of over ₹1.5 trillion. In the current fiscal alone, it has raised demands for ₹15,316 crore, which includes the ₹3,871 crore during the February-March budget session.
Maharashtra's minister of state for finance Deepak Kesarkar said out of the additional grants demanded on Wednesday, ₹8,349 crore will be a direct burden on the state's annual budget. “This is what the state has to provide for from its budget as a matching grant for central government programmes in Maharashtra.”
Kesarkar said the state was providing for the repayment of ₹1,520 crore loans it had taken to purchase tur dal (pigeon pea) from farmers, besides ₹2,515 crore for rural development programmes. The supplementary demands also include ₹850 crore for metro projects, ₹300 crore for the Bharat Net programme, and ₹250 crore as seed capital for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project.
He said of the total supplementary demands raised so far, nearly ₹52,000 crore was a direct burden on the state's budget. The biggest component of supplementary demands is the farm loan waiver, for which the state had to provide ₹35,000 crore. “Of this, ₹26,000 crore has already been released and we expect an additional allocation of ₹9,000 crore for the remaining beneficiaries. There isn't any cause for worry on that front,” Kesarkar added.
With Maharashtra agreeing to implement the 7th Pay Commission recommendations for state government employees, the state government will have to shell out an additional ₹23,000 crore every year. The supplementary demands raised so far has provided for ₹10,000 crore towards the revised wages.
Conceding that the state's fiscal deficit stood at ₹58,975 crore, Kesarkar exuded confidence that the deficit will be offset by a buoyant revenue collection. “Goods and services tax (GST) collection in the first quarter of this fiscal year is 39% higher than that of the corresponding period in 2017. In June, the collection has been 21% higher year-on-year. Last fiscal, Maharashtra collected ₹1.15 trillion from GST. This fiscal, the collection is already more than ₹21,000 crore. If this trend continues, we might be able to offset the loss on account of fiscal deficit,” he added.

Staff salary costs at Newmarket Town Council could be slashed by around £100,000 this month, after cuts were approved by councillors.
At a town council meeting on January 30, councillors agreed to cut its £250,000 staff budget to around £150,000.
Four staff members have left, Kay Dawson, Anna Rozbicka, Ady Thompson and former town clerk Isabelle Barrett.
Cllr Andy Drummond told the News: “We are trying to recruit at a lower level, more commensurate to the role rather than the staff costs being out of control.
“I was horrified to see the wage bill when I became mayor. It's been difficult times. We've still functioned and have done everything we needed to do on the lower staffing levels, which brings into question – what did the higher staffing costs achieve?”
Ms Barrett, 45, who left in October last year, received £7,000 of public money for a private neck operation in 2013, after the council voted the decision through.
Then mayor George Lambton argued that the former clerk would have had to wait six weeks to have the operation on the NHS, adding that it was in the “best interests of the council”.
A town council spokeswoman said: “On the October 24, 2016, our town clerk left the council. We would like to wish Isabelle well for the future. The same goes for Ady Thompson, who left on January 31, Anna Rozbicka, who left on January 20, and Kay Dawson, who left on December 31, 2016.”
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's threatened tariffs on $34 billion of U.S. goods will take effect from the beginning of the day on July 6, a person with knowledge of the plan told Reuters, amid worsening trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

Washington has said it would implement tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6, and Beijing has vowed to retaliate in kind on the same day.
However, the 12-hour time difference puts Beijing ahead in terms of actually implementing the tariffs.
“Our measures are equal and being equal means that if the U.S. starts on July 6, we start on July 6,” the source told Reuters, who requested anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to media. “The implementation time for all policies starts at midnight.”
China's customs agency did not answer a phone call seeking comment, and its commerce ministry did not reply to a fax requesting comment.
Speaking at a daily news briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China was ready to act, though did not confirm the date Chinese tariffs may start.
“China has already made preparations. As long as the United States issues a so-called tariff list, China will take necessary measures to firmly protect its legitimate interests,” Lu said, without elaborating.
Chinese state media on Wednesday kept up its steady drum beat of criticism of the United States.
The official China Daily said the United States was intentionally trying to prevent China from developing so it was unable to challenge the United States' role in the global economic order.
“The U.S. has maintained hegemony in the military and financial fields for many decades. Now it is pursuing economic hegemony,” the English-language newspaper said in an editorial.
“It has frequently waged wars against other sovereign countries and made use of the dominant influence of the U.S. dollar in the international markets to fleece other countries. Now it is attempting to resort to an all-out trade and economic war to hold back China's normal development.”
Widely-read tabloid the Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, said the increasingly likely trade war would bring chaos to the world.
“Counterstrike is major economies' first reaction to Washington's trade war,” it said in its editorial.
“It's hard to predict where these moves will lead the world, but Washington will unavoidably pay heavy prices for its attempts to change the whole world to its economic tributary.”
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to escalate the trade conflict with tariffs on as much as $400 billion in Chinese goods if Beijing retaliates against the U.S. tariffs set to take effect on Friday.
Chinese currency and stock markets have been jittery ahead of Friday's tariff implementation.
The Google Play Store is home to millions of mobile games, and while a lot of them are truly excellent, there are also quite a few that aren't even worth the time of day. To help you better decide which games are downloading and which aren't, Google is launching Play Instant on the Play Store.
Using the Android Instant Apps technology that was announced back at Google I/O in 2016, Google Play Instant enables you to play small portions of games before downloading the whole thing. These previews can include the first level of a game, tutorial, or a small mini-game, with this decision being left entirely up to developers.
There are a few different Play Instant games you can try right now, including Clash Royale, Words With Friends 2, Mighty Battles, NYTimes Crossword, and more. Additional games will be added soon, and you can find them in the Instant Gameplay library on the Play Store and in the Arcade tab in Play Games under "Instant Gameplay."
So far, Play Instant Games seem pretty solid. Titles like Mighty Battles and Words With Friends 2 offer short tutorial-like levels that let you get a taste of what each one has to offer, but on the other hand, the Instant Game for Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire is nothing more than a tapping mini-game that has nothing to do with the real offering. Again, all of what's offered here is up to developers.
Play Instant Games are available now as part of a closed beta, but Google says it plans on "opening it more broadly later this year."
How to use gestures to become an Android home screen expert
It's only 30 seconds long, but Marvel's latest teaser for “Ant-Man and the Wasp” packs a lot of ghost-vanquishing action into a little space.
As in the trailer released at the beginning of the month, the new Memorial Day teaser still gives few clues as to how the film will connect to “Avengers: Infinity War.”
“If you want to do something right, you make a list,” says Paul Rudd's character Scott Lang, explaining the steps in his mission to bring down Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen).
“We have to save the world — that's major, we can't forget that,” Lang says to Hank Pym, played by Michael Douglas and Hope Van Dyme, played by Evangeline Lilly.
“Avengers: Infinity War” has made more thank $626 million domestically since its April 27 opening, and a stratospheric $1.9 billion globally.
“Ant-Man and the Wasp,” the 20th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is directed by Peyton Reed. Kevin Feige produces with Louis D'Esposito, Victoria Alonso, Stephen Broussard, Charles Newirth, and Stan Lee serving as executive producers. Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Rudd, Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari wrote the screenplay.
“Ant-Man and the Wasp” opens July 6. Watch the trailer above.

Spending your own money on health care might mean that you'll be more frugal with it. That's the theory behind health savings accounts, a decades-old GOP concept that's sparking renewed interest on Capitol Hill as Republican lawmakers look for ways to replace the Affordable Care Act.
HSAs are like personal savings accounts — with a difference. As with a retirement account, money put into an HSA can be invested, and any growth in the fund accumulates tax-free. Withdrawals can be made at any time, and they are tax-free, too — but the money can only be used to pay for certain medical expenses, such as health insurance deductibles, or for copays for hospital care or a visit to the doctor.
Currently, HSAs are only available to people who have high-deductible health plans, meaning they usually pay a few thousand dollars for medical care each year before their insurance kicks in to pay its share. While HSA participation is growing, only about 20 million people out of the 176 million who have health insurance participate in these savings accounts, according to a 2015 report by the Association of Health Insurance Plans.
Why don't more people who are eligible for HSAs have them? For one thing, not everyone has money to contribute upfront. But psychologists and behavioral economists point out that even many people who have the extra cash on hand confront big psychological barriers to saving.
"How we think and feel is directly tied to our ability to make 'good' financial decisions," says Alycia DeGraff, a board member and secretary of the Financial Therapy Association. DeGraff says when faced with financial decisions about the future, many people simply get stressed-out.
"These stressors can become so overwhelming that ... we can become debilitated and ignore the situation all together," she says. "Or we can practice any kind of defense mechanism — entitlement, suppression, overcompensation, isolation, etc. — to try and deal with [it]."
This may explain, at least in part, why middle-class Americans are pretty bad at saving money in general. Only about half of us have money in any sort of retirement account. And those of us who are parents have only saved, on average, enough to pay for about one year at an in-state college for our kids.
Saving money is hard. It means setting aside what we want now for something we think we'll want or need later. And we live in a culture that offers a lot of pretty, shiny, things to buy RIGHT NOW.
Plus, we all pretend we won't get old or sick.
"People are predictably irrational," says Dr. Mitesh Patel, especially when it comes to money. He's a behavioral economist, physician and assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine.
But many of us really hate to lose money, Patel says, which is what makes the concept of HSAs is so appealing.
For example he and his colleagues published a study last year in the Annals of Internal Medicine on what motivates people to lose weight, and found that the way a financial incentive was framed made all the difference.
The researchers observed three groups of people for 13 weeks. They told one group to walk 7,000 steps a day. About 30 percent of the group did so. Meanwhile, people assigned to the second group were told they'd be paid $1.40 every day they walked 7,000 steps. About 35 percent of the second group did so.
Here's the kicker: Each person in the third group was paid $42 upfront and was docked $1.40 each time they failed to meet their goal. Forty-five percent of that group met the assigned goal, Patel says. People hate to lose money.
Another way to encourage more saving might be to make HSAs operate more like the 401(k)s that required people who didn't want to participate to actively opt out of the plan — rather than requiring people who want to contribute to opt in. "This creates a path of the least resistance," Patel says.
Of course, setting up and overseeing such a plan would likely cost the government some money, he notes.
People with HSAs do use less health care than those without such plans, a recent study from the Employee Benefits Research Institute suggests. But it's unclear whether they actually improve their health. Prescription drug costs went down for people enrolled in HSAs in the EBRI study, but emergency room visits went up — particularly for lower-income families.
Then there's the issue of figuring out how much you, as an individual or a family, would need to save for health care — it's not easy to find out the average price for a medical test or procedure in your town, let alone how much that price varies from doctor to doctor or hospital to hospital.
"If you want to save for a house, you can pretty much figure out the math," Patel says. "But if you go to a doctor, they don't give you a menu for prices."
To really increase their health savings — or any savings — we'd all need to change our mindset, says Degraff, the financial therapist.
"People would have to first take a dose of reality and get real about their future selves," she says. Naturally, we thing our future selves will be "better, healthier, more financially secure," she adds. But, for many of us, health and income eventually decline with age. We need to save more now for later.
HSAs can be useful, Degraff notes, but only for those who have enough cash to pay their day-to-day expenses — plus a little left over.
"A lot of people don't even have a regular emergency fund savings," DeGraff says, "especially those that are already struggling to pay for health insurance."

NEW YORK - A 23-year-old Jewish man was fatally stabbed and his brother wounded by a man who had blocked their driveway overnight Sunday in Brooklyn.
The ordeal happened just before 11:30 p.m. Sunday on East 73rd Street near Avenue M in the Bergen Beach neighborhood.
The Dahans' driveway was blocked, and they were trying to figure out who the car belonged to when the car's owner finally returned. A brawl broke out, and at some point, a knife was pulled. Both brothers were stabbed.
Omari Dahan, 23, z”l, who was stabbed in the chest, was rushed to Beth Israel Hospital where he later passed away. His 29-year-old brother, yet to be named, was treated for a stab wound to his left arm and is expected to recover.
Investigators said the two attackers fled the scene in a gray Volkswagen Jetta. No arrests have been made.
Volunteers from Misaskim are overseeing that the niftar receives proper kavod hames, and are waiting for the NYC Medical Examiner to clear the body for kevurah.
A source in Misaskim told Hamodia that the levayah is tentatively set to be held later Monday in New York, and will continue to Eretz Yisrael.
He noted that, unfortunately, the Dahan family has been struck with several tragedies. In 2009, the father, Shlomo, died in a desperate attempt to rescue his son Harel from the deadly fumes of an 18-foot-deep cesspool at a Queens sewage plant. They were overcome by toxic fumes of a putrid well at a waste transfer station at a Queens sewage plant where they were working. The father and brother were buried in Zichron Yaakov in Eretz Yisrael.

Transitioning From Military To Civilian Life Can Be Especially Difficult For Female Veterans The number of female veterans has been growing rapidly, but leaving the military carries its own challenges for women. Mental health experts have begun focusing more on their transition to the civilian world.
Trinidad and Tobago defender Daneil Cyrus insisted he did not have a drop of alcohol on New Year's Day and said he felt unfairly vilified after coach Tom Saintfiet told the media that Cyrus and his former W Connection teammate, Jomal Williams, came to camp late and smelling of alcohol.
Both players were axed from the Trinidad and Tobago squad to face Suriname and Haiti in 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup playoff action on Wednesday night and Sunday afternoon respectively at the Ato Boldon Stadium in Couva.
However, Cyrus said his reputation could be unfairly tarnished by Saintfiet's statements. And, although he stressed he did not want conflict with the Soca Warriors coach, the defender disputed any suggestion that he touched alcohol before joining the team camp.
“People think I came into camp smelling of alcohol,” Cyrus told Wired868. “[Saintfiet] asked Jomal: ‘You are smelling of alcohol'? And [Jomal] said ‘Yes, I took a drink with my family'.
“He never told me anything about that. And I never took a drink.”
Saintfiet's exact words to the media were:
“Two of the players came one and a half hours too late in camp and had still decent smell of alcohol around him (sic). That was Daneil Cyrus and Jomal Williams. Both were immediately sent home, back to party but are replaced in the squad.”
Cyrus, who has 62 full international caps, tried to explain the chain of events that led to him being dropped from the national team.
The Connection defender, who also played professionally in Vietnam and the United States, said he got a flat tyre while driving to the team's camp in Claxton Bay and realised he did not have a jack in his vehicle. He was in St Helena at the time.
Cyrus claimed he then called a friend who came from Santa Rosa in Arima to help him change his tyre.
The setback meant he was over an hour late to meet his teammates at the Cara Suites Hotel. All players were supposed to be at the hotel by noon but, according to Cyrus, he got there at 1.26pm.
On the way, he said he picked up Williams, who was supposedly having trouble getting a taxi to the Cara Suites. Cyrus said he relayed his mishaps to the technical staff via national teammates Alvin Jones and Aikim Andrews, who are both also Connection players.
“I called and told Alvin what happened,” said Cyrus. “And then Aikim called and he put on the manager, Azaad [Khan], who told me the coach was mad…”
Cyrus said when he and Williams got to the hotel, he went to see Saintfiet who immediately demanded to see the flat tyre to verify the defender's story. He said they were heading to check the flat when the Belgian coach got a whiff of his teammate.
Everything changed quickly after that.
“The coach asked me to see the flat tyre that I changed and I said okay,” said the 26-year-old Cyrus. “But before we could do that, he said: ‘Jomal, you are smelling of alcohol'? And Jomal told him that he took a drink before he came with his family.
“And then coach told us to wait in the lobby. And when he came back, he said: ‘Okay, you can go home. Go and party'.”
Wired868 tried unsuccessfully to reach Williams for his account of what transpired.
Cyrus said he was stunned by Saintfiet's reaction but shook the coach's hand and left. He insisted that he is fully committed to representing Trinidad and Tobago.
“It wasn't anything that I could control,” said Cyrus, who is a former two-time World Youth Cup player. “I am fully committed to play for my national team—anytime!”
Tall, mobile and aggressive, Cyrus was considered one of Trinidad and Tobago's top prospects when he broke into the senior squad, six years ago. But, like most of his teammates, he disappointed in 2016.
Cyrus looked especially vulnerable in the Warriors' two World Cup qualifying defeats in the Hex to Costa Rica and Honduras. But he held his hands up and admitted that his performances have not been good enough.
“I wasn't really at my best for the last two [World Cup qualifying] games and everybody knows that,” said Cyrus. “I know that too. Sometimes a player might be going through a good patch and sometimes a player is going through a bad patch.
“For the Guatemala match [on 2 September 2016], I thought I had an okay game but for the last two games I really wasn't at my best. I am not hiding. I just had two bad games.”
Cyrus plays central defence for Connection but was a regular at right back under former National Senior Team coach Stephen Hart. And, in his two outings under Saintfiet, he appeared in central midfield.
“I can play anywhere on the field, once I get time to adjust to the position,” he said. “A footballer should be able to play anywhere on the field. In the last game [against Nicaragua], I even got a chance one on one [with the opposing goalkeeper] and I missed…
“I do prefer to play centre back, honestly. But any position they let me play, I play it to the best of my ability.”
Cyrus will have to look on from the outside as Trinidad and Tobago try to book their place at the Gold Cup without him. The Warriors face Suriname from 7pm on Wednesday at the Ato Boldon Stadium.
He hopes his stay on the sidelines is brief, though. And he insists that he did not have an alcoholic drink on New Year's Day.
In a new interview with the New York Times, Uma Thurman reveals that she too was assaulted by disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. Additionally, she accuses Weinstein's longtime collaborator, director Quentin Tarantino, of abusive and negligent behavior that put her life at risk on the set of Kill Bill.
In an article titled “This Is Why Uma Thurman Is Angry,” the actress details two separate encounters in which Weinstein engaged in sexual misconduct. The first incident occurred following the release of 1994's Pulp Fiction, of which Thurman co-starred and Weinstein produced. She says Weinstein exposed himself to her and led her into a steam room. When she questioned his motives, he became “very flustered and mad and he jumped up and ran out.”
A short time later, Weinstein allegedly forced himself on Thurman in a London hotel room. “It was such a bat to the head. He pushed me down. He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things,” she recounts. Thurman says she later confronted Weinstein about his behavior, to which he responded by threatening her career.
In 2001, Thurman reunited with Pulp Fiction director Quentin Tarantino for the film Kill Bill. At that point, Thurman says her relationship with Weinstein was non-existent, regarding him as an “enemy” and refusing to give him the time of the day. Still, as Weinstein was the producer of Kill Bill, the two ran in the same social circles and attended the same Cannes Film Festival after party in 2001. It was during this party, Thurman says that she informed Tarantino of her past experiences with Weinstein. Tarantino apparently confronted Weinstein that evening, leading Weinstein to pull Thurman aside and give her a “half-assed apology.”
While Tarantino stood up for her that night, Thurman recalls an incident on the set of Kill Bill that nearly left her paralyzed. In the famous scene where she's driving the blue convertible to kill Bill, Tarantino asked her to do the driving herself. But after being informed by a crew member that the car was not safe, Thurman asked Tarantino to instead use a stunt driver. She says he refused and eventually she relented and agreed to film the scene herself. Thurman's concerns were justified, as she ended up crashing the car into a tree.
“The steering wheel was at my belly and my legs were jammed under me,” she remembers. “I felt this searing pain and thought, ‘Oh my God, I'm never going to walk again.'” Thurman says the crash left her with a “permanently damaged neck and screwed-up knees.” Following the accident, she threatened to sue Tarantino, Weinstein, and Weinstein's production company, Miramax. For years, Tarantino refused to provide her with the footage of the incident, and it was only after she threatened to go to the police, that he handed it over.
“When they turned on me after the accident,” Thurman tells the Times, “I went from being a creative contributor and performer to being like a broken tool.” She also recounts other abusive incidents in which Tarantino spit in her face in the scene where Michael Madsen is seen on screen doing it, and choking her with a chain in the scene where a teenager named Gogo is on screen doing it.
“Harvey assaulted me but that didn't kill me,” she concludes. “What really got me about the crash was that it was a cheap shot. I had been through so many rings of fire by that point. I had really always felt a connection to the greater good in my work with Quentin and most of what I allowed to happen to me and what I participated in was kind of like a horrible mud wrestle with a very angry brother. But at least I had some say, you know?”
“Personally, it has taken me 47 years to stop calling people who are mean to you ‘in love' with you. It took a long time because I think that as little girls we are conditioned to believe that cruelty and love somehow have a connection and that is like the sort of era that we need to evolve out of.”
The North Valley Public Library has a new mural gracing the front wall of the building on Main Street in Stevensville. A young girl sits under an apple tree reading a book titled “Rebecca” while her dog snoozes as horses and cattle graze in the lush valley beneath the Bitterroot Mountains. And right in the middle of it all sits the cowboy artist Charlie Russell taking it all in.
Artist Ken Daly, who donated his work to the library, said when designing the mural he pictured a young girl reading a book under the apple tree as her dog slept nearby and let his daughter choose a title for the book. Although many people upon seeing want to complete the title as “Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,” the 1903 children's novel by Kate Douglas Wiggin, that's not the book his daughter chose. The book she chose was the 1940 novel “Rebecca” by Daphne du Maurier. He said in the beginning he had no intention of adding Charlie Russell to the scene. But after visiting the Charlie Russell Museum in Great Falls he just had to stick him in.
Daly grew up a fourth generation Californian but went to college back east and eventually connected with his father's family in New York where he learned the business of commercial art. Daly said at first he actually wanted to be a mural painter but after the first few scathing reviews of his work he changed his mind. Now he thinks maybe he shouldn't have taken the criticism so seriously.
Next, he thought he would become an independent illustrator. But his wife at the time wanted to go back to school so he opted for a steady job and got one in a design studio, mostly illustrating ads for companies like Champion Lumber and First Banks, Pepsi and Pepperidge Farm.
Then he met a horse trainer named Paul Burns and from that experience came up with the idea of painting horses. Not painting horses literally, but painting portraits of horses. He got pretty good at it and decided to follow the market, which led him to an interest in the Quarter Horse market, which led him to Texas. When the oil companies hit hard times in the mid-1980s, his business painting rich Texans' horse portraits began to flag. So, he packed up and headed to Florida where Polo Ponies were the big thing.
“Palm Beach, at the time,” he said, “was the equine capital of America in winter.” The rich guys would fly in and out and were hard to approach, he said, but their horse handlers were around and they saw his work and wanted it. He ended up painting Polo Horses and Thoroughbreds until 2008. He ended up trying to make it in New York again but after three years he said he couldn't stand the crowds.
When he was living in California in the late 1970s, he had three cousins who moved to the Bitterroot Valley. They told him to stop by if he was ever passing through and he did.
“They said I would love the place, and I did,” said Daly. So, when he finally had to skedaddle out of New York for some wide open spaces, this was the place he headed for and he has no regrets.
“When I worked in those other places I always got a check, but I rarely got a thank you,” he said. “Here I get a lot of thanks. People just say thank you and they really mean it.”
He doesn't expect or need the same kind of money he used to make, he said. But right now he is a painter for hire in the Bitterroot, or a prospective art teacher for anyone wanting private lessons or lessons for their kids. He's getting a bit old to be breaking broncs, but he can still brush them up. He can be reached at kenmcd@cox.net.
Kyle Larson Makes It A Three-Peat With A Win In The Pure Michigan 400
Posted by: newsla on Aug 14, 2017 - 06:45 AM Kyle Larson Makes It A Three-Peat With A Win In The Pure Michigan 400
Kyle Larson made 2017 his own celebration at Michigan International Speedway. He once again used a late-lap pass to win the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Pure Michigan 400.
Larson certainly knows the way to victory lane at Michigan International Speedway and has left his mark on the track with famous burnouts. The win marked the second straight Pure Michigan 400 victory for Larson and the third straight overall Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series win at Michigan.
Larson joined some elite company with his third consecutive Monster Energy Series win at MIS. A pair of NASCAR Hall of Famers are the only other two drivers to accomplish the feat. Bill Elliott won four straight from 1985-86. David Pearson won three consecutive races at the two-mile oval from 1972-73.
Michael McDowell spun with three laps to go in the race and collected Paul Menard to bring out the red flag to clean up fluids on the track. After a brief stoppage in the action, the intensity hit a crescendo on the restart.
The red flag allowed each driver run through all the options. Larsons team owner Chip Ganassi put the idea of going three wide into his drivers thought process.
I was running a few options through my head of what to do if I got a good jump, and that was one of them and it worked out perfect, Larson said. I cant believe that happened. We were struggling all day. We were definitely not as good as the last two times we won here, but we preserved and had a great restart at the end.
After the red flag it was time for NASCAR overtime and a two lap dash to the finish.
Martin Truex, Jr. lined up on the outside with teammate and Michigan native Erik Jones on inside. But it was Larson who lurked just behind in fourth place. Larson got the best restart of his career and quickly went three wide into turn one.
Coming out of turn two it was Larson in the lead and he held that position coming to the white flag. Truex made one more run at Larson, but Larson held off the challenge.
Larson led two laps all day, but they were the most important laps of the day. He led the final two laps of the day.
Jones finished in third place, his best finish in the cup series. He had a chance to collect his first win and knew it would be even more special at his hometown track.
I did for a few moments and then the 78 (Truex Jr.) really kind of picked it up there the last 50 laps or so and he was really fast, Jones said. We were kind of in our own league there for a long time  we were kind of matching lap times, he would go faster and I would go faster. I really thought that whoever was out front was going to win, unfortunately neither of us got it done. Neither of us really got going great after that last restart. I spun my tires, he spun his and it just wasnt what we needed at the end.
Rochester Hills, Michigan native Brad Keselowski started on the pole and dominated the early part of the race. He won the first stage, leading 56 of the 60 laps in the stage.
NASCAR will return to at Michigan International Speedway twice in 2018. NASCARs the fastest track will once again host two great weekends of racing in 2018: June 8-10 and August 10-12.
The first Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race weekend is June 8-10. The FireKeepers Casino 400 will be on June 10. The ARCA Racing Series presented by Menards will start the weekend with the Corrigan Oil 200 on June 8 and the NASCAR XFINITY Series race will be on June 9.
On August 10-12 the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series will return to NASCARs the fastest track. Monster Energy Series practice and qualifying will be on August 10 and the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series LTi Printing 200 is scheduled for August 11. The Pure Michigan 400 will wrap up the NASCAR racing season at MIS on August 12.
Nestled in the lush Irish Hills of Southeastern Michigan, Michigan International Speedway is NASCARs the fastest racetrack. It has been the love of NASCAR racing and the thrill of a great time for race fans and drivers alike for nearly 50 years.

How To Buy Swim Trunks For Your Body Type
Here's The Key To Picking The Right Swim Trunks For Your Body Type
Summer is here, and you know what that means: you'll most likely be spending your entire week staring out the window of your office longing for the feeling of sand between your toes. Then, you'll hopefully be spending all weekend lounging at the beach with a cold one in hand wondering why work is even a thing in the first place. That's what warm weather is for, right? But before you set off for the shore, there's something just as important as making sure you have the most comfortable lounge chairs imaginable: rocking swim trunks that are made for your body type.
We've all seen those guys at the beach with trunks that just aren't working for them. There are the trunks that are so short they're basically in speedo territory, ones that are so tight they look like they might split in two, and of course the ones that are riding so low that the next big wave is bound to whisk them away, never to be seen again. As nice as it would be to just swing over to your closest apparel store and grab any ol' pair, that won't do you much good: there are some crucial guidelines to remember — from the length to the pattern — that will ensure you're feeling confident and comfortable once you arrive in sandy paradise.
Just like when you're looking for other articles of clothing, the best way to go about shopping for swim trunks is looking to your height and build. Some people put a lot of thought into a suit or pair of jeans, but when it comes to swimwear, it's an afterthought. By taking the time to jot down tips based on your body type, you'll feel just as good and put-together catching waves as you do in your business meetings. And considering you're half-naked on the beach, why wouldn't you want to make the most of the one item of clothing you are wearing? Follow our advice, and you're sure to find some swim trunks that look like they're made for you.
Tall Guys
If you're tall, there's a good chance you have long legs. And anyone who has long legs needs to be careful that their swim trunks aren't too short.
“Short swim trunks will only make your legs will look longer than they already are. They should hit right above the knee,” says Eric Himel, fashion expert and celebrity stylist. “If you're tall and skinny, make sure you don't get a bathing suit that's too slim — this will make you look even taller and skinnier.”
As for the look of your trunks, you might want to pick something with a little personality. Himel says by choosing a pattern as opposed to a solid, you'll visually break up the length of your legs, while something plain will make you look taller. Avoid vertical stripes for the same reason.
Try These: Bonobos The Banzai Trunk 9"
Fitting right above the knee, these tropical print swim trunks will make you feel like you're heading straight to paradise the second you put them on. Plus, the 4-way stretch and curved waistband will ensure the perfect fit.

Short Guys
If you're a shorter guy, you can easily elongate your body by choosing the right type of swim trunks.
“Proportion is the most important thing for short guys,” Himel says. “Pick a pair of trunks that hit the middle of your thigh and make sure it's fitted, but not skin-tight. This will lengthen your legs and make you appear taller.”
When it comes to the print, ditch the Hawaiian flower pattern: you'll want to stick with solid colors to visually lengthen your legs.
Try These: Lacoste Men's Basic Swim Trunks
For a pair of trunks that are simple yet stylish, try these on for size. With a 5" inseam, they'll hit the middle of your thigh and give you an elongated look.

Medium Guys
If you're a happy medium — not too tall and not too short — get excited because you have the most options to choose from.
“You can go for swim trunks that are on the shorter side all the way down to just above the knees, and anything in between,” Himel says. “Pattern-wise, you're good-to-go with anything! This is the easiest body type to buy a bathing suit for.”
Try These: Chubbies The Pool Sharks
These shark-print swim trunks will hit right in the middle of your thigh, so they're not too long or short. With an elastic waistband, stretch mesh liner, and back pocket, you'll be comfortable and have a place to store those shells you spotted.

Slim Guys
The most important thing to keep in mind if you're slim is making sure your swim trunks don't look baggy.
“You'll want to get a tailored bathing suit, otherwise, if it's too baggy, it'll make you look even thinner,” Himel says. “If you can find a bathing suit that tapers in at the leg, even better.”
As for the design, a large pattern will add visual bulk to your frame. And if you want to add even more bulk, choose something with pockets.
Try These: J.Crew 9" Board Short in Nautical Stripe
Aside from the classic design, these board shorts are known for their moisture-wicking fabric that will have them dry by the time you walk to your car.
$69.50 at JCrew.com
Heavier Guys
If you're on the heavier side, the key is to look for swim trunks that aren't too snug or too loose.
“Make sure your bathing suit isn't too tight. Conversely, a common mistake heavier guys make is to buy a bathing suit that's uber-baggy to accommodate their extra weight — this just makes you look sloppy,” Himel says.
When you're looking at the different designs, avoid horizontal stripes and light colors, as well as wide waistbands and pockets.
Try These: Patagonia Men's Light & Variable Board Shorts
The great thing about these board shorts is that they have a 2-way mechanical stretch, a notched outseam for movement, and simple design that's sure to flatter anyone who puts them on.
$59.00 at Patagonia.com
Muscular Guys
Anyone who's worked hard in the gym all year long is probably dying to hit the beach come summertime, but don't show off your assets too much.
“We get it — you spend all of your time at the gym. Your muscles are extra prominent, so no need to wear anything that's too form fitting,” Himel says. “A more casual, looser look will make you look like you're not trying too hard.”
Pattern-wise, there's only one thing to keep in mind: just avoid patterns that have a curved design, as they'll make your muscles look overly bulbous.
Try These: Vineyard Vines Fishbones Embroidered Chappy Swim Trunks
These casual-cool swim trunks have a minimalist design with some colorful fishbone embroidery and a bright drawstring. They'll make you stand apart without making you look like you're flaunting your hard-earned muscle.

ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: Diplomatic tensions between India and Pakistan intensified on Monday with Islamabad protesting against the denial of visas to over 500 pilgrims seeking to visit Ajmer Sharif and India saying “prevailing circumstances” and absence of security clearances were the reasons for its decision.While not denying that visas had been withheld, an official source said, “Such visits are facilitated and promoted following due processes. However, from time to time, such visits cannot take place in view of prevailing circumstances and absence of security clearances. There have been instances in the past when such visits did not take place from both sides.”The Pakistan foreign office said, “Pakistan notes with deep disappointment the non-issuance of visas by India for the visit of 503 Pakistani zaireen (pilgrims) to participate in the urs of Hazrat Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer Sharif, India, from 19-29 March 2018.”The decision not to grant visas indicates India is ready to suspend travel, usually seen as part of “people-to-people” contact and a consideration extended to visits to places of religious significance, in view of allegations of harassment of diplomatic staff and shelling of civilian areas in Jammu & Kashmir by the Pakistani army.In its statement, Pakistan said due to India's decision, Pakistani pilgrims have been deprived of the opportunity to participate in the urs, which is of special significance. Foreign office spokesperson Muhammad Faisal said 192 Pakistani pilgrims could not participate in the urs of Hazrat Khwaja Nizamuddin Aulia in Delhi in January this year due to non-issuance of visas.Temperatures have been rising with India and Pakistan at loggerheads in the past month as both sides traded charges of diplomats and mission officials being harassed in each other's capitals. Pakistan brought the issue out in the open with its complaints last month and several notes verbale have been issued by India.The ministry of external affairs summoned Pakistan deputy high commissioner Syed Haider Shah to lodge a protest “at the loss of lives of five innocent Indian civilians (a family comprising of husband, wife and three children) and grievous injuries to two other minor children in unprovoked ceasefire violations by Pakistani forces on 18 March in Bhimber Gali sector across the Line of Control in J&K”.Making its outrage clear, India said that “the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians, who are located two kilometres away from the forward line of defences, by Pakistan forces using high-calibre weapons is highly deplorable and is condemned in the strongest terms”. Pakistan criticised the India of not giving visas to its pilgrims, saying: “Besides being violative of the bilateral protocol of 1974 and the basic human right to religious freedom, such measures also undermine the efforts aimed at improving the environment and normalising relations between the two countries.”
County councillors are expected Wednesday to approve the second phase of a millpond project designed to clean up Cedar Creek and ultimately the Thames River into which it flows.
Norwich Township is home to the former Hodges millpond that hasn't been used in decades. Located off Old Stage Road, nearly 400 acres of land surrounding the pond and owned by the County of Oxford is in the process of being re-naturalized.
“The planned phase two works for the Hodges Pond rehabilitation project form part of a multi-year strategy to reestablish the natural Cedar Creek bed channel and create multiple wetland areas, complete with vegetative reforestation in a manner which will enhance sustainable environmental features in this area,” said Oxford County director of public works David Simpson in an email. “In doing so, the above work will expand the natural habitat for fish, plants and wildlife in this area, which will lead to increased biodiversity over time.”
Historically, Cedar Creek, which flows through the pond, has had some of the lowest quality of water of the tributaries that drain into the Thames River. Due to a decline in use, the Hodges reservoir had become a sediment-filled shallow lake with low oxygen levels and high bacteria.
“One of the major ecological improvements will be altering the current waterway from a warm water, low oxygen pond to a natural cold water system, one which is capable of supporting cold water fish species and other aquatic life,” Simpson said.
The Hodges Pond project is a partnership between the Cowan Foundation, Oxford County, Stewardship Oxford, Ducks Unlimited Canada, the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.
Phase one, which includes the draining of the pond and the “natural realignment” back to the original Cedar Creek bed channel, has been completed.
It was funded by $50,000 donated by The Cowan Foundation.
In order to initiate phase two, the county must enter a conservation agreement with Stewardship Oxford and Ducks Unlimited over a term of up to 20 years that will allow them to access funding.
Stewardship Oxford Inc. has committed $5,000 to the phase two works and is currently seeking funding approval from the Ministry of Natural Resources.
Subject to council approval ­­county staff has included a reforestation budget in the draft 2018 business plan of $10,000 in both 2018 and 2019.
The county has also recently applied for $45,000 of additional funding for reforestation through the Municipal Greenhouse Gas Challenge.
During phase two, soil excavation from the drained pond will be used to bury the old dam for safety purposes and create earthworks along the original creek channel in order to support a natural habitat for plants and wildlife.
The former lake bed will be converted to shallow open water wetlands on each side of the creek.
The second phase would also include the removal of nonnative species plants and re-establishment in cells of native species.
The diversification of vegetation is designed to attract more wildlife.
As the new channel stabilizes, a mixture of native grass, coniferous seedlings, deciduous tree saplings and shrubs will also be planted.

Just makes sure you activate the phone within 30 days to get the sale price.
If you're in the market for a solid, mid-range Android phone, it's hard to do much better right now than the Moto X4. The X4 may ditch the customizable nature of past Moto X devices, but it still offers an incredibly well-rounded smartphone experience with a very fair retail price of $399.
We've got no problem recommending the X4 at that price, but if you're on Project Fi, you can now pick it up for a mere $249. That's the lowest price we've seen on the Moto X4 yet, even outdoing the Prime Exclusive variant that requires you to sell your lock screen to Amazon ads. Also, for comparison's sake, that makes the Moto X4 the same price as its less powerful Moto G5 Plus sibling.
It's also worth noting that this is the Android One model of the phone, so while you won't have access to Alexa like you do with the regular unlocked version, you do get a more stock-like Android experience with faster software updates.
You will need to activate the phone on Project Fi within 30 days of shipment in order to qualify for the deal, and failing to do so will result in you being charged the full $399. However, since there's no minimum activation time, you could technically buy the X4, activate it for $20, pause or cancel your Project Fi subscription, and the take the phone to another carrier.
If you're interested in this deal, it's available now until February 14 at 11:59 PM PDT.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) has begun trading on a new private stock trading venue, or "dark pool," that lets its clients use the bank's algorithms to buy or sell stocks at a benchmark price reached over a period of time.
Trading in the new dark pool, known as JPBX, began the week of July 17, according to data from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
The move comes at a time of increased regulatory scrutiny of dark pools that has led to a number of trading venues being shuttered, and highlights JPMorgan's efforts to expand its equities business.
JPMorgan's securities unit also runs JPMX, a dark pool that matches shares in a more traditional manner, within the spread of the best bid and offer prices shown on public stock exchanges like those run by Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) or Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (ICE.N) New York Stock Exchange.
Brokers looking to get benchmark pricing for their orders can access the new dark pool through JPMorgan's algorithms.
For instance, a broker might have an order for 5,000 shares to buy while another broker has an order for 2,000 shares of the same stock and wants to get the volume-weighted average price. JPBX will lock up the 2,000 shares on both sides for say, two minutes, and then execute at the average price of the stock over the previous two minutes.
The bank hopes to have the dark pool fully launched by the end of the month, said a person with knowledge of the matter who did not have permission to be quoted in the media.
JPMorgan spokeswoman Jessica Francisco declined to comment.
Nearly every major bank has a dark pool, a trading venue that does not have to provide information such as trade sizes or prices to the public prior to trades taking place, with the aim of getting large orders done with minimal price movement.
Dark pools have historically been lightly regulated when compared with public exchanges, but in recent years have come under increased scrutiny, driving up legal, compliance, and technology costs for the firms that run them. Over the past several years, the number of dark pools has dwindled to around 30, according to FINRA, from around 50.
For the week of July 24, 417,289 shares were crossed on 3,636 orders in JPBX, up from 2,220 shares on 16 orders the previous week, according to FINRA.
(Reuters) - Thailand's Phachara Khongwatmai and Italian Nino Bertasio fired impressive rounds of seven-under-par 65 to sit at the top of a congested leaderboard on day two of the Maybank Championship on Friday.
Englishman Lee Westwood, a two-time winner in Malaysia, took the charge in the morning with a spectacular 62 that got him to 10-under overall and the clubhouse lead alongside Scot Marc Warren and Japan's Yuta Ikeda.
It looked set that the trio would share the lead heading into the weekend at Saujana Golf and Country Club but Khongwatmai went on to open up a one-shot advantage on the back of some brilliant iron play on the back-nine.
The 18-year-old made a steady start with birdies on the fifth and sixth but then came to life after the turn, displaying his enormous potential to collect five consecutive birdies from the 11th.
”I‘m very happy with my score,“ Khongwatmai said. ”My plan is to shoot under par every day and play against the course.
“I don't want to think ahead or compare my score to another player. It is only two rounds so the tournament is not over yet. I want to focus day by day and hole by hole.”
Bertasio grabbed a share of the lead from the last group of the day, making eight birdies to reach 11-under overall.
England's Chris Paisley, who had held a one-shot lead at the end of the opening round, made sure he built on the strong start with a 69 to join the group in the second spot.
Heading into the weekend, 22 players were within three shots of the lead, with the cut-line sitting just seven shots behind the leaders.
Big changes could be coming to the way you get around town, but before any changes are made, the company wants to make sure everything goes smoothly.
On Sunday, STARS buses in Saginaw offered passengers a free ride to test the new routes.
"I like that. Right by my house. Right across the street a matter of fact,” Sandra Boone said.
Change doesn't always come easy, but STARS is trying to take the pain out of a big change coming to their bus routes. It's the first time they'll take a new path in more than 40 years.
The company gave their riders a chance to test the new routes for free in exchange for feedback.
"We're very excited - excited to get to see the feedback from the public just to see their comments and any issues or concerns they might see before we actually roll out on the twenty first,” Manager of Transportation Sherina Turner said.
Many riders depend on the service to get to work, doctors' appointments and go grocery shopping. So, a switch could completely change their whole routine.
Boone rides the busses every single day to get to work, so when she got the opportunity to ride for free and try out the new changes, she jumped at the opportunity.
“Oh my God, I've been waiting years for this to come. I work six days a week at the McDonald's on Tittabawassee and sometimes I work on Sundays and I just love riding the bus,” Boone said.
Boone said she takes her commute seriously. She even brought a pen and paper to take notes, but couldn't find a complaint.
In fact, she even said the changes could help her pick up a second job.
"They've got the lift running 24 hours a day on Sundays because I might get a part-time job and so now I'll have a way to work and back home,” Boone said.
The new system officially begins on Aug. 21.
STARS encourages everyone who rides the bus to come test the new routes.

DEAR ABBY >> My only sister has been borrowing money from me every month for years. She has a ton of credit card debt and cannot afford to meet her monthly financial obligations.
Last year my husband and I paid her property taxes for her so she wouldnt lose her house. It was over $5,000. She promised to pay us back with her tax return money, but we never saw a dime.
I have given her information on debt consolidation programs and offered to pay for her to file bankruptcy, but she has done nothing to improve her financial situation.
She works and makes OK money. Her husband is disabled, but gets Social Security and a small pension. She also supports her adult child, who doesnt work, and she smokes like a chimney.

I have told her many times that I cant keep giving her money, but she still asks every month. This is causing a strain in my marriage. I dont know what else to do. Any words of advice would be appreciated.
 Tired of Being Asked for Money
DEAR TIRED >> You are a caring sister, but what you have done out of love and charity has allowed your sister to continue living beyond her means. The next time she asks for money, remind her that you have already given her information about debt consolidation, and that you will no longer continue pouring your and your husbands hard-earned money down a bottomless pit. Then stick to your guns.
DEAR ABBY >> My husband and I, 21 years happily married, have a recurring problem. It rarely happens, but when it does, it causes an argument.
A recent example: Late the other evening, my husband, adult daughter and I were returning home from a hockey game in separate cars due to our work schedules before the game. There are several routes to get home from where we were. I followed my daughter, while my husband took a different route to get home faster.
I think it would have been a chivalrous and fatherly thing for him to follow us and make sure we made it home safely. I got angry that he didnt do it, and it turned into a huge argument. My grown daughters and I are fiercely feminist and independent, but I still think it would have been the caring thing to do. My own father would, even after I was 40, and he still does it to this day.
It didnt bother my daughter, but it bothered me. What are your thoughts, Abby? If you think its not an issue, I will let it go from now on.
 To Follow or Not to Follow
DEAR TO FOLLOW >> Your father comes from a generation in which men were taught it was their duty to protect the females in their family. Your spouse is the husband of a fiercely feminist wife and the father of a daughter cut from the same cloth. Independent women do not need to be followed home unless they request it because they assume they can handle whatever happens themselves  particularly if they are traveling in twos. You cant have it both ways.
You say you have a happy marriage. Please give your husband a break.

WICHITA, Kan. (AP)  A slain Kansas psychiatrist was stabbed more than 160 times at his clinic in Wichita last month, according to a newly released arrest affidavit for a patient charged in the attack.
Umar Dutt, 21, is jailed on $1 million bond on charges of first-degree murder in Dr. Achutha Reddy's Sept. 13 killing at his Holistic Psychiatry Services clinic.
A clinic employee reported hearing Reddy calling for help and then seeing Dutt stabbing the psychiatrist, according to the affidavit written by a Wichita police detective. The employee was able to briefly separate the two. Reddy then ran out the back of the clinic with Dutt following him, according to the affidavit, which was released Thursday.
Reddy also suffered "blunt force trauma" and may have been run over by a vehicle, the affidavit states. The doctor who conducted the autopsy on Reddy also identified "approximately 165 sharp force trauma injuries." Investigators haven't released a possible motive in the attack.

A short time after the stabbing, a country club security guard spotted a blood-covered man sitting in a car registered to Dutt's father and called 911. Dutt was taken to a hospital, where medical staff determined he wasn't physically injured.
Authorities spotted a baseball bat in the back seat of the car and blood on the tire tread, the affidavit says.
Defense attorney Kurt Kerns told The Wichita Eagle that "more evidence will be coming to light" and "everybody is entitled to be presumed innocent."
An attorney for Dutt's family previously released a statement offering their condolences to the doctor's family. Raj and Azra Dutt said their family would continue to suffer "the terrible toll and consequences of mental illness."
"Mad Money" host Jim Cramer has changed his tune on Snap almost 2 months after comparing the company to the early days of Facebook.
Cramer identifies the app's unpopular redesign as the main culprit and says the stock is too expensive at the moment.
He says he would consider buying in the future.
Jim Cramer is turning his back on Snap.
The "Mad Money" host, who sometimes has enough influence to move stocks, likened the company to an early Facebook after the company's fourth-quarter earnings report showed revenue surged 72% versus a year ago.
"Sure, I was a skeptic, but after this quarter, I'm now a believer," Cramer said on "Mad Money" following the report. "In many ways, Snap reminds me of where Facebook was years ago when the company finally figured out how to address its mobile problem. So even though the stock skyrocketed up an astounding 47 percent today, it's got a lot of run room and it is a natural to be bought."
But Cramer's opinion appears to have changed in the wake of the Snapchat's redesign. He now worries that advertisers will abandon the Snapchat app if user engagement declines as a response to the redesign and negative celebrity tweets.
The December app redesign spurred controversy by splitting up media and celebrity stories from the user's personal contacts. In late February, celebrity user Kylie Jenner tweeted her own opinions on the change and said she no longer uses the app as a result of the update which led to a 7% decline in shares.
Other celebrities have since voiced their displeasure with the redesign.
After spiking more than 40% following its fourth-quarter results, Snap shares gave back all of those gains as the redesign continued to receive bad reviews. But Cramer says shares are still too expensive.
"The stock is not cheap here," Cramer said on "Mad Money" last Tuesday. "I say take a pass — for now — at least until we know whether the Snapchat redesign will actually hurt them. I think it's a little bit too risky."
He added, "At a certain price, it is time to hit the buy button."
Snap is scheduled to report its first-quarter results on May 1. Wall Street is expecting an adjusted loss of $0.17 a share on revenue of $243.85 million.
Snap shares are up 7.15% this year.
WWE News: MMA star Tito Ortiz spotted at SmackDown Live
What was the former UFC Champion doing in Anaheim?
@JamesJVaccaro by Jamie Vaccaro News 15 Feb 2017, 10:06 IST
Former UFC Champion, Tito Ortiz
What's the story?
According to a story on wrestlezone.com, Tito Ortiz was seen at Smackdown! Live tonight in the crowd.
In case you didn't know...
Tito Ortiz actually has a history in professional wrestling, making sporadic appearances for TNA Wrestling in 2005 and 2013. He was a special guest referee for several matches in 2005, serving in the role for two Jeff Jarrett NWA World Championship defences, both of which he lost.
In 2013, Ortiz returned to TNA as he revealed himself as the man responsible for the #August1Warning Youtube videos and tweets before he stared The Main Event Mafia and Aces and Eights down. Ortiz would end up turning on The Main Event Mafia and align himself with Aces & Eights.
On the No Surrender pay-per-view, it was announced that Bellator MMA had pulled him from TNA programming due to his upcoming pay-per-view fight with Quentin “Rampage” Jackson.
Ortiz announced that his fight against fellow former UFC star, Chael Sonnen, at Bellator 170 in January 2017, would be his last MMA fight. Tito won in the first round via submission.
The heart of the matter
Twitter user @dosleprechauns posted a picture to his Twitter account of Tito Ortiz in the crowd at Smackdown! Live tonight.
What's next?
It's not entirely certain what is next in this situation, as it's unknown at this point if Tito Ortiz has had any discussions with WWE, or if he was just in attendance as a fan of the product.
Sportskeeda's Take
If Tito Ortiz was in the audience specifically to watch with his family, we hope he enjoyed the show. If you're watching the show and you are trying to see him in the crowd, he and his family are located behind the commentary table. Smackdown! Live was filmed in Anaheim, California tonight, which is very close to Tito's hometown of Huntington Beach.
However, if Tito Ortiz was there as a guest of Vince or Shane, that's an intriguing possibility. Tito Ortiz turned forty-two years old this year, but age hasn't stopped WWE from pushing talents before. After all, Bill Goldberg just turned fifty years old and he's likely to be in the main event of WrestleMania this year. Tito is a legitimate athlete who has a fighting background, and if Vince is aware of who he is, he might be interested.
We doubt that Tito was in attendance as anything other than a fan, but stranger things have happened.

City musician Danny Bronson plans to transport audiences back in time Friday night with his new tribute show The Music of Glen Campbell: Songs From the Goodtime Hour at Showplace Performance Centre.
The concert will feature the hits of the late American singer, guitarist, songwriter, television host and actor known for his hit songs from the 1960s and 1970s and for hosting a music and comedy variety show, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, on CBS.
Galveston, Rhonestone Cowboy, By the Time I Get To Phoenix and Gentle on My Mind are among the classics on the set list.
"They are going to bring back a lot of memories. People will remember virtually every song of the show," Bronson said. "It's just great music."
Other local talent joining Bronson on stage are Barry Haggerty on guitar, Rob Phillips on keyboard, Curtis Cronkwright on drums and Andrew Affleck on bass.
The concert follows the success of Bronson's Gordon Lightfoot tribute he performed last year for Canada's 150th anniversary. The show went so well, he decided to put together the latest concert, a co-production with Showplace.
Inducted into the Peterborough Pathway of Fame's music and entertainment category in 1999, Bronson has been a professional musician and entertainer for more than four decades. By day, he is a family services co-ordinator for Little Lake Cemetery.
He wrote Fleming College's official song, Let the Deed Show, before revamping the piece last fall in honour of the school's 50th anniversary. He has also been the musician for the Citiots Improv troupe, currently on hiatus.
Bronson encouraged music-lovers to come out Friday night for some nostalgic fun.
"That's what it's all about."
5 Controversial Roman Reigns Rumors That The WWE Universe Needs To Know about

What is going on with Roman Reigns right now?
Love him or hate him, almost everyone in The WWE Universe has an opinion about Roman Reigns. Of course, some of the negativity he receives isn't his fault, especially since he was pushed multiple times by the company when he wasn't ready, but his lackluster promos and less than acceptable charisma were serious factors in that.
With that being said and WWE seemingly shifting Roman Reigns' character a little bit on Monday Night Raw, here are five rumors that The WWE Universe needs to know about Roman Reigns and WWE's plan for him going forward. As always, let us know your thoughts in the comments below and tell us if you think WWE's new plan for Reigns will work.
#5 Dean Ambrose turning on The Shield.
Dean Ambrose can change everything by turning on Roman Reigns!
Believe it or not, WWE has an opportunity to rewrite history when it comes to how the Shield faction came to an end. While it was Seth Rollins that turned heel and joined The Authority the first time by attacking his friends, WWE now has an opportunity to change that and turn Ambrose into the villain this time.
According to Brad Sheppard from Bodyslam.net, "Dean Ambrose could return to WWE as a heel and insert himself into the Universal Championship picture. This means that if either Roman Reigns or Seth Rollins could win the Championship from Brock Lesnar at SummerSlam, then Ambrose could step into a feud with one of his former teammates."
Not only does that allow for WWE to put The Shield back together for a period of time, it will also allow for Ambrose to betray Reigns down the line, which could gain the troubled star a lot of sympathy if done right. In fact, that plot twist, along with his heelish demeanor last week on Raw could be a sign that WWE's plan to make him the guy is working.

The latest episode of Gotham was full of suspense, drama and all round action; in other words, it was everything that we could've wanted from an episode of the budding superhero series. Although, to be fair, Gotham has been pretty impressive since returning to screens for its fourth season. And despite previous criticism for deviating from the comic book source material, the hit Fox series has been making great progress in developing the Batman mythology during Season 4.
While some comic book fans will continue to stand against Gotham for its deviations, there's no denying that show pays tribute to the Batman legacy in every way possible and it did so once again in this week's installment.
A '60s Batman Easter Egg
During Episode 4, #Gotham paid tribute to the classic '60s #Batman series in an extremely subtle way. In fact, it was so subtle that only the most die-hard Batman fans would've picked up on it, so if you missed it then doesn't worry — you're definitely not the only one. After a mysterious young woman rescued Edward Nygma from his icy terror (the Penguin had frozen him and put him on display in the Iceberg Lounge), it became clear that Ed was having trouble with his brain. Simply put, he was having a very literal form of brain freeze. The girl tried to stimulate the clever villain's mind by asking him a series of riddles. One of the riddles was "What's black and white and red all over?"
Have you guessed the answer yet? No, okay. How about now? Okay, okay, I'll tell you. The answer is a newspaper. Pretty clever. Want to know how I know the answer? Well, that's because I remember it being featured in the Batman TV series. During one particular episode, Frank Gorshin's legendary Riddler taunted Adam West's Batman by recording a series of riddles and sending them to the Caped Crusader. Yep, you guessed it: One of the riddle was indeed the same one that was featured in this week's Gotham. Check out the classic scene below:
As a long time Batman fan, I've always associated the newspaper riddle with the Caped Crusader's mythology and I was pleasantly surprised by its use in the latest Gotham. Considering that we lost Adam West this year, it's awesome to see Gotham paying tribute to the iconic show, even in such a subtle way. Additionally, while it's probably a coincidence, another thing that struck me about this week's Gotham was the music used as Ra's Al Ghul's score. Maybe it's just me, but I thought it sounded remarkably like a slowed down, creepier version of the Riddler's theme tune from the classic series.
Not The First Time 'Gotham' Has Paid Tribute To Other Batman Adaptations
This isn't the first time that Gotham has paid homage to previous Batman adaptations. Previous episodes of Season 4 have seen the series borrow several elements from Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins. In fact, Bruce Wayne's evolution into Batman is very similar to the version depicted in the 2005 blockbuster film. But I would have to say that my favorite tribute occurred in Season 3, when the hit series recreated the birth of Catwoman scene from Batman Returns.
I'm pretty sure that Gotham will continue to pay tribute to previous Batman adaptations as Season 4 continues. I mean, it's easy to see why the prequel series continues to do so, with a mythology that has been interpreted countless times across several platforms, there are many possible storylines to pull from and too many cool Easter Eggs to miss out on. Who knows what Batman movie will be incorporated next? I'm excited to find out, that's for sure!
Gotham airs Thursdays on Fox.

Central Alabama CrimeStoppers regularly issues alerts to help catch criminals in the River Region, and on Friday, the community showed their support for the organization, helping raise funds to pay out rewards for key tips.
CrimeStoppers hosted their annual golf tournament on the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail at Capitol Hill in Prattville, their biggest fundraiser.
“CrimeStoppers is important. It binds the community with doing good for the community and law enforcement,” said Janet May, CrimeStoppers' marketing director. “It's important to show the unity and support. Doing this allows us to operate throughout the year and without CrimeStoppers, a lot of what's happening in the community would not be solved.”
“The program empowers people to call 215-STOP when they can't call police because of other circumstances. This program is important for the community, law enforcement and the victim,” added Executive Director Tony Garrett.
Fundraising supports the CrimeStoppers' tip line, as well as their different community initiatives, including their gun reward program in schools. So far, nine guns have been recovered.
“The other day, we got a call from a person walking down the street who saw two juveniles with an assault rifle close to a school bus. They called 215-STOP and we were able to get that person in custody,” Garrett said.
CrimeStoppers hoped to raise $75,000 on Friday.
“This tournament is one of the ways we keep the program going,” Garrett added. “Our budget is small, we have a limited staff and a majority of the money we raise goes directly back into the community.”
If you would like to donate, call Janet May at 334-324-1462. You can also donate through their website or call 215-STOP.

PanARMENIAN.Net - Nearly 50 years ago, computer visionary Robert Taylor helped lay the foundations for what we know today as the internet.
Taylor, who had Parkinson's disease, died Thursday, April 13 at his home in Woodside, Calif., his son Kurt Taylor tells NPR.
Like many of his peers who helped build the internet, Bob Taylor, as he was known, wasn't a computer scientist. The University of Texas at Austin graduate had a background in psychology and mathematics. Taylor was inspired by the idea of expanding human interaction using computer technology, Guy Raz noted in an interview profiling Taylor in 2009.
In the 1960s, Taylor was a researcher at the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, where his frustration with what he saw as inefficient communication led him to envision an interconnected computer network.
At ARPA, Taylor had three separate computer terminals in his office to communicate with his colleagues across Berkeley, MIT, UCLA and Stanford. Each terminal connected to a different computer in a different part of the country, he told Raz.
"To get in touch with someone in Santa Monica through the computer, I'd sit in front of one terminal, but to do the same thing with someone in Massachusetts, I would have to get up and move over to another terminal," Taylor said. "You don't have to look at this very long to realize this is silly. This is stupid. So I decided, OK, I want to build a network that connects all of these."
That shared network, ARPANET, evolved into what would become the internet. To build it, Taylor assembled a group of smart people, like Bill Duvall at Stanford, Len Kleinrock at UCLA and the 21-year-old programmer Charley Kline.
After many a trial and error, it was Kline, on the night of Oct. 29, 1969, who sent an electronic message from a computer the size of a one-bedroom apartment to another computer at the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, with Duvall was on the receiving end.
The first communication over a shared computer network was — well, it was supposed to be the word "login." Instead, Kline only typed the first two letters before a bug crashed his computer. "Lo," therefore, became the first utterance transmitted by the revolutionary communication.
"Any way you look at it, from kick-starting the internet to launching the personal computer revolution, Bob Taylor was a key architect of our modern world," Leslie Berlin, a historian at the Stanford University Silicon Valley Archives project, told The New York Times.
But Taylor was unconcerned with getting that kind of recognition. In fact, in 1999, when President Clinton awarded him the National Medal of Technology, Guy Raz says, Taylor didn't even bother to fly to Washington to accept it.
Taylor went on to create personal workstations with displays that incorporated icons instead of typed commands, NPR's Wade Goodwyn tells our newscast, the graphic template for the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows.
In addition to Kurt, Taylor is survived by his two other sons, Erik and Derek, and three grandchildren.
“Ong Bak” producer and director Prachya Pinkaew will line up with Singapore's Sam Loh (“Siew Lup”), Malaysia's Woo Ming Jin (“The Tiger Factory”) and South Korean genre specialist Oh In-chun (“The DMZ”) to pitch their genre movie projects at July's Network of Asian Fantastic Films.
A five-day project market, NAFF has selected 25 projects from 19 territories to be presented to potential investors and co-producers. Outstanding projects will receive cash awards and post-production support totalling $33,000 (KRW 36 million).
NAFF is part of South Korea's biggest genre film festival, the Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival (BiFan). It runs July 14-18, 2018.
Korean projects include Kim Soo-young's fantasy horror thriller “Superpower Girl,” Jeon In-hwan's parallel universe fantasy “Remember Spring,” Lim Jin-seung's fantasy black comedy “Autumn Man” and Oh's “Night at the Evil Gallery.”
From elsewhere in Asia, Loh will pitch omnibus ghost story “Hellhole,” Woo will pitch “Siri” and Thailand's Pinkaew pitch “2701 First Love” for Nuttakorn Trivittayakorn to direct.
The market turns its Project Spotlight on India, and presents four projects from the country. Among them is “The Ordeal,” a film adaptation of Henry James' novel, “The Turn of the Screw.” Non-Asian selections include Norway's “The Nightmare,” Finland's “Red Snow” and Argentina-Brazil-Bolivia co-production “The Eternal White.”
PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Friday it was “deeply concerned” that Syria's government was flouting its pledges to stop using chemical weapons and Paris was working with its partners to shed light on recent suspected toxic gas attacks.
Senior U.S. officials said on Thursday that the Syrian government may be developing new types of chemical weapons, and U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to consider further military action if necessary to deter chemical attacks.
Rescue workers and medical groups working in the rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta, near to Damascus, have accused government forces of using chlorine gas three times over the last month, including on Thursday morning.
French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Von der Muhll said that reports from the OPCW, the global chemical weapons watchdog, indicated that Damascus had not met commitments made in 2013 to fully abandon its chemical stockpiles and was not conforming with international conventions banning their use.
“This gives rise to our deepest concern. France does not accept that the convention prohibiting chemical weapons be challenged,” von der Muhll told reporters in a daily online briefing.
President Bashar al-Assad's government denies using chemical weapons, which it agreed to destroy in 2013 under an agreement brokered by Russia and the United States.
“We are actively working with our partners on this issue and on all reports of new chemical attacks in Syria,” von der Muhll said.
A deadly sarin attack on a rebel-held area in April 2017 prompted Trump to order a missile strike on the Shayrat air base, from which the Syrian operation is said to have been launched.
French President Emmanuel Macron has said that Paris could launch unilateral air strikes against targets in Syria if a new chemical attack took place, although he has since said he would coordinate any action with Trump.
Feb 2 (Reuters) - Britain's Cineworld said a majority of its shareholders backed a $3.6 billion deal to buy U.S. cinema chain Regal Entertainment.
Shareholder advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had urged investors last week to oppose the deal, citing “significant financial and operation risks.”
Other shareholder advisory firms, including PIRC, had recommended that investors back the takeover.
London-listed Cineworld agreed in December to buy Regal Entertainment through a reverse takeover funded with debt and a 1.7 billion pound ($2.42 billion) share sale.
Cineworld said 87.34 percent of votes cast at a general meeting backed the acquisition, which will give the British company a presence in the U.S. market and transform it into the world's second-biggest cinema chain by number of screens, with more than 9,500.
A majority of Cineworld shareholders also approved the share sale to fund the deal, the company said on Friday.
“As will be seen from the proxy votes, there was very strong support from shareholders for the acquisition,” Cineworld's Chairman Anthony Bloom said in a statement.
The takeover would put the combined company in a better position to take on industry leader AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, and give it more scale to fight growing competition from Netflix Inc, Apple Inc and other digital outlets.
Cineworld expects to complete the transaction on or before March 2. ($1 = 0.7033 pounds) (Reporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Adrian Croft)
Mark Hemsley was in a very different position the last time European lawmakers put the region's traders on red alert.
The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive in 2007 opened national exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange up to significant competition for the first time. Armed with little more than his spreadsheets and a laptop in the cafes of the City of London, in 2008 Hemsley delivered Bats Europe, the baby venue that would go on to become a colossus in the market for trading shares in Europe.

Haas 'shocked' to beat Federer as Germans flourish in Stuttgart
A shocked Tommy Haas could not quite believe he knocked Roger Federer out of the Stuttgart Open on Wednesday.
by Omnisport News 15 Jun 2017, 01:09 IST
Tommy Haas and Roger Federer
Tommy Haas stunned Roger Federer as German players progressed from three of the four second-round matches to be played at the Stuttgart Open on Wednesday.
Federer's long-awaited return to the ATP Tour did not produce the victory the Swiss would have hoped for despite cruising through the opening set.
After 10 weeks off, the 18-time grand slam champion looked understandably rusty, and Haas took full advantage as he battled back to win 2-6 7-6 (10-8) 6-4 - a victory that even surprised the 39-year-old.
"I'm pretty speechless. Playing Roger is always very special, especially on grass. It's tough to put it into words right now, a lot of emotions," he said in his on-court interview.
"I am obviously very happy about the win, and kind of, sort of, shocked myself.

"He hasn't played a match in 10 weeks. The first match back is always the toughest, so maybe deep down I thought to myself there's maybe a small chance if I can serve well and play well, hold my serve, and that was the case.
"I didn't really believe it [that I could beat Federer] to be honest."
Haas will face sixth seed Mischa Zverev in the last eight after his straight-sets win over qualifier Yannick Hanfmann.
Germany's third win of the day came as Steve Johnson - seeded fifth - came up short in a thrilling battle with Philipp Kohlschreiber, the American losing 7-6 (7-3) 5-7 7-6 (8-6) after more than two and a half hours on court.
However, Jan-Lennard Struff was unable to make it a clean sweep for the host nation as he lost a deciding-set tie-break against Lucas Pouille.
Struff saved four match points but also let one of his own slip by before Pouille, the fourth seed, found the baseline with a crisp groundstroke to complete a 4-6 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (10-8) win.

India, 4th July 2018 : The FIFA #WorldCup 2018 has been a rip-roaring roller-coaster ride, and the round of 16 hasn't failed to deliver on that front. With shock results and late drama forming a bulk of the narrative, football fans on Twitter can't stop talking about the tournament. Twitter is where football happens, and the round of 16 has caught everyone's attention on the platform.

What do you get when two of the best players in the world make a #WorldCup exit on the same day? Heartbreak! That's exactly the emotion that fans on Twitter expressed last Saturday, when both Argentina and Portugal were knocked out. The result was a World Cup devoid of Ronaldo and Messi, and an emotional outpouring by both sets on fans on Twitter. No surprises then that the duo became the most mentioned players on the platform for the Round of 16.

Rafa Benitez wants improved backing on transfers to ease his Newcastle “suffering.”
The Magpies' boss has refused talks about an extension to his contract as he prioritises keeping the club, who sit four points above the drop zone with eight games to play, in the top flight over the coming weeks — and getting promises on a clear plan for the future.
But he admits that is an incremental process after being left frustrated by the way they have worked in the last three transfer windows.
In a wide-ranging interview at the team's Spanish training camp, Benitez, who took over two years ago with the club bound for the Championship then led them straight back up, said: “I enjoy it when we are winning, but it's difficult to enjoy it when you are suffering all the time. You win — and then you lose.

“The priority was to go up, and now the priority is to stay in the Premier League.
“Still, there are a lot of things that you cannot change.
“Someone has to take responsibility. The problem in football is sometimes you take the responsibility for the mistakes of others. If something is wrong, then you have to change but still you don't have all the tools that you want to have to make the right decisions.

“Still you are working with people and they have been there for years and they have a way to do things. So it's little by little.
“We have changed the scouting department. We have more information. Still someone has to make the decision.
“Even when you have the name of the player, to bring the player here sometimes it means you have to pay a transfer fee or you have to pay wages or you have to attract him because you are in the Premier League, not on the brink.”
LIVE SCIENCE:
The tomb of a woman named Hetpet, who became a senior official in the royal palace, has been discovered in a cemetery on the Giza Plateau, archaeologists from Egypt's antiquities ministry announced today (Feb 3).
The tomb dates back over 4,300 years, to a time after the Giza Pyramids had been constructed. While Giza is most famous for its pyramids, the site also contains large cemeteries that archaeologists have been uncovering gradually for nearly two centuries. These tombs often hold the burials of elite members of ancient Egyptian society.
“The tomb has very distinguished wall paintings, in a very good conservation condition, depicting ‘Hetpet' standing in different hunting and fishing scenes or sitting before a large offering table receiving offerings from her children,” Egypt's antiquities ministry said in a statement.

Whitney Houston's ex-husband Bobby Brown is not a fan of the cover art for Pusha-T's new album, “Daytona,” which features a photo of Houston's drug-infested bathroom, taken in her Atlanta home in 2006 after an alleged binge. Kanye West, who produced the album, reportedly paid $85,000 to license the photo for the seven-song collection, released on May 25.
“Why would he post that on his album cover?” Brown said in an interview with Rolling Stone. “That's really disgusting that he would do that. That's in really bad taste. Something should happen to Kanye. He's already crazy. I knew that when I first met him. Now he's pushing the bar a little bit. He needs somebody to slap him up or something. And I'm just the person to do it.”
The Whitney Houston estate issued a statement Tuesday in response to the cover, saying it was “extremely disappointed in Kanye's choice” to use the photo. “Even in Whitney's death, we see that no one is exempt from the harsh realities of the world,” the statement said.
Pusha spoke with Radio Host Angie Martinez on May 24 and said that West, who produced the entire album, changed the artwork at the very last minute.
“He changed my artwork last night at 1 a.m. He wasn't feeling it,” Pusha told Martinez. “The [original] artwork — it was pictures that we all agreed on. He picked the photographer, I took these pictures, I was like, ‘Yo, these are fresh.' I picked all of these pictures out, he had a little edit to it, how he wanted the actual grading of the picture to look. Picked the picture, great, we look, boom, boom, boom, it's good.”
As one of the “Grey's Anatomy” doctors might put it: “Seriously?!”
Netflix has lured Shonda Rhimes away from ABC. It's a coup for the streaming giant, of course. That's the first takeaway.
But the second is a little more nerve-wracking. I hope Rhimes doesn't ditch all the baggage that comes with putting shows on a broadcast network.
Of course, it'll be fascinating to see what Rhimes and her team do when they're freed from the strictures of a broadcast network. But it'd be a shame if the procedural baby got thrown out with the bathwater.
What America doesn't need is more streaming dramas that sag and drift. Rhimes' snappy, smartly paced and succinct style of storytelling is the antithesis of a lot of the draggy one-hours in the streaming realm (and elsewhere).
So the question is, will Netflix change her or will she change it? It's too soon to tell, but I'm pulling for the latter.
Since “Grey's Anatomy” debuted a dozen years ago, Rhimes has built her empire atop a series of very solid and conventional foundations. The medical drama is one of the things that broadcast networks often do well — the bedside crisis of the week supplies opportunities for all kinds of accessible and emotional storytelling.
“Grey's” has its innovative elements — the cast (and the directors and crew) looked like America long before other networks truly got the memo on inclusivity and diversity. Most doctor dramas never had soundtracks as addictive as the one for “Grey's.” More importantly, it's never gotten quite enough credit for depicting professional women, in particular women of color, as multi-faceted, complicated human beings.
All that said, in many ways, “Grey's” got huge because, at its core, it's so recognizable and relatable. The relationships and romances at the center of the show are often the draw. The patients and medical dilemmas on screen often follow familiar trajectories. It's not as heavily serialized as many streaming dramas, and a viewer doesn't necessarily need to know an overwhelming amount of mythology to enjoy an installment of the show.
“How to Get Away With Murder,” even at its most baroque and outlandish, often provides a delicious showcase for star Viola Davis, and it uses the conventions of a prime-time legal drama when it suits the ABC series' pell-mell needs. For its part, “Scandal” took the political soap opera and jacked it up into something aggressively paced and, at its best, melodramatic in all the most vivid and memorable ways.
It can be a dizzying ride, but when it works, “Scandal's” confrontations land with dizzying but entertaining force. And airing on ABC didn't stop it from being sexy, deadly and full of political sideswipes and pointed commentary. Even when it got serialized (maybe a little too much so in later seasons), the energy of the show kept propelling the narrative forward — something that's not often said about streaming dramas.
But what about those fun live-tweeting experiences? Sometimes the power of a drama comes from the fact that it is fully immersed in the pop-culture dialogue. In its early days especially, “Scandal” was brought to prominence by the Twitter dialogue around it. And it's the intense interactivity of the “Scandal” experience that makes me wonder how Rhimes' shows will work on Netflix.
Even when a show there becomes popular, the reactions to it are more diffuse and slower to build. “Stranger Things,” of course, became a phenomenon last summer, so that kind of explosion can happen for a Netflix offering. But how will Rhimes' shows — which are often built to be highly accessible and talked about in the moment — function in the streaming arena? Will the new shows she dreams up for Netflix fade out quietly after an initial fanfare?
At this TV-saturated moment, that's the fate of too many shows on all sorts of networks. TV critics spend some of our rare free time talking with each other about how hard it is to keep up with the deluge of output. It's very challenging to try to sample every new scripted show in its first season, let alone check out later seasons, which is often when great runs begin to take shape.
According to FX, TV will supply viewers with more than 500 scripted shows this year alone, and Netflix in particular appears to be determined to flood the zone with content, content and more content. Many shows on dozens of networks die quickly, fade out without much fanfare or simply limp along in a semi-void, with few people talking or writing about them. Without the hook of weekly episodes and the attendant social-media chatter, will Rhimes' new shows be able to break through the clutter?
Of course, Netflix thinks so, hence this sea change, which will continue to reverberate for some time. When the fundamentals of the business are so uncertain and the competition is getting fiercer every day, betting on a name brand is a smart move. The war for talent in TV is as cutthroat as anything that's happened on Olivia Pope's watch, and the broadcast networks — or really, all networks without very, very deep pockets — are finding it more and more difficult to hang on to the most notable writer/producers.
Netflix's Rhimes coup should be a wakeup call to the broadcast networks: If you can't bank on name talent, find emerging writers with distinctive voices (which is what Rhimes was in the early aughts, when “Grey's Anatomy” blew up into a giant hit). Continuing to play it safe, a tendency that (again) pervades too many of the new fall broadcast network shows, is a losing game.
Business concerns aside, snagging Rhimes' company, Shondaland, may well be a creative win for Netflix. This development is tantalizing in so many ways. Along with many other TV aficionados, I wonder what ideas Rhimes has that wouldn't have worked on ABC but may well be right for a platform that allows all kinds of storylines, tones and creative forays. It'll be exciting to see her and the writers she works with venture into more challenging and risky areas, and engage in more serialization if they think it's warranted.
But if her new shows are also accessible, propulsive, full of bittersweet romances and memorable monologues, and have some conventional, familiar elements, I'm unlikely to complain.

Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar on Monday directed police to go all out against the drugs peddlers in the state. The direction comes in wake of the death of two tourists owing to suspected drugs overdose in north Goa.
Parrikar on Monday held a high-level meeting with Director General of Police (DGP) and other subordinate police officials in this regard.
According to information, Parrikar has asked the police to go tough on drug menace and take necessary action against hotels, restaurants and rave parties. If need be, even go to the extent of arresting the hotel/restaurant owners and promoters or organisers of rave parties, Parrikar has told the police.
“We have to act against the drug trade,” Parrikar said after the meeting adding that, “however, the responsibility also lies on the respective police inspectors (police stations in-charge).”
Director General of Police Dr Muktesh Chander said that police have devised new strategies to tackle the drug menace. “Police officials have been already directed to increase their action against the drug trade. Crackdown on drug trade is going on, as last year we had booked around 60 cases whereas this year till date, around 55 cases have been booked,” said Chander. He said, “We are taking specific measures and changing our strategies to curb drug menace. The anti-narcotics cell of the Goa police will be strengthened.”

OTTAWA — The federal Conservatives say if the Liberals are willing to put up billions of dollars to save the Trans Mountain pipeline to the West Coast, they should be willing to provide the same level of certainty to revive the Energy East line to the East Coast.
Opposition parties are sharpening their attacks on the government's decision to buy Trans Mountain for $4.5 billion to ensure it gets built, with the Conservatives looking to see how far the government is willing to go on other pipelines and the NDP arguing the Liberals have completely abandoned their environmental principles.
Conservative MP Lisa Raitt says the government seems to take for granted the 32 seats it won in Atlantic Canada in the last election, since it is willing to give certainty to Trans Mountain but didn't step in to save Energy East when TransCanada pulled the plug on that project last fall.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Energy East is "old news" and the Conservatives are just embarrassed that they couldn't get pipelines built when they were in government.
Iran Focus
London, 7 Dec - An Iranian-backed militia in Iraq has threatened to attack American forces in the country over Donald Trump's decision to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv.
Al-Nojaba militia chief Akram al-Kaabi said in a statement: "The decision by Trump on Al-Quds [Jerusalem] makes it legitimate to strike the American forces in Iraq."
The number of US troops in Iraq- who are fighting ISIS- varies between 5,000 and 9,000 depending on which figures you use.
There are roughly 1,500 fighters in this group, which was established in 2013 and is supported by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).
They are part of the Iran-backed Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilization) auxiliary force which has been fighting ISIS in the Middle East alongside the Americans and has also been deployed to Syria by the Iranian Regime to help prop up the Bashar Assad Dictatorship.
However, as we know, Iranian proxy groups rarely act on their own volition as the Regime uses them to fight proxy wars. This was likely ordered by the Iranian mullahs who have also expressed their criticism about Trump's move.
Following Trump's announcement on Thursday, the Iranian Regime criticised the decision, saying that it violated international resolutions, and threatened a "new intifada", or uprising against Israel.
In a statement on its website, the Iranian foreign ministry said: "The provocative and unwise decision by the US... will provoke Muslims and inflame a new intifada and an escalation of radical, angry and violent behaviour."
It continued: "Iran strongly condemns this move and urges the international community, influential countries and especially Islamic countries to prevent the implementation of this US action, which is only of benefit to the Zionist regime, to preserve the stability of the region”.
Although the Regime's statement referred to Jerusalem as "an inseparable part of Palestine", a subject of controversy across the world, it should be made clear that Iran does not care about Palestine.
Currently the Iranian Regime's support of the terrorist group Hamas in Palestine is dividing the Palestinian forces, which makes it harder for Palestine to negotiate a unified peace deal and therefore harder t convince the US to stick to the status quo regarding Jeruselum.
The Iranian Regime doesn't care about regional peace either, or it would stop destabilizing the Middle East through terrorist proxies.
This is simply the Iranian Regime's way of attacking America, which it calls the Big Satan, for a decision that benefits Israel, which it calls the Little Satan.

DOUGLAS COUNTY — Law enforcement authorities are investigating the death of three people including a 3-year-old girl.
Just after 1:30p.m. Sunday, deputies responded to report of a shooting in the driveway of a home in the 1000 Block of E900 Road southwest of Lawrence, according to a media release.
Upon arrival, deputies found a 36-year-old woman with several gunshot wounds. She died at the scene. She was not affiliated with the residence, according to the sheriff's department.
Authorities later found the woman's vehicle in the parking area at Baker Wetlands south of 31st and Haskell Avenue. A 41-year-old man and 3-year-old girl were found dead in the wetlands not far from the vehicle. Authorities have not determined how they died.
Authorities believe the man shot the woman and the child is their daughter and no other individuals were involved. Names of the victims were not released.
NORMAN, Okla. — Oklahoma's quarterback situation is not as settled as it seemed.
The Sooners are seeking a replacement for Heisman winner Baker Mayfield, and Kyler Murray and Austin Kendall are the top candidates for the job. Murray was the backup last season while Kendall redshirted. Based on Murray's outstanding work last season, it seemed he was the clear front-runner. Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley said that's not the case.
"Austin has started to settle in this last half of spring," Riley said after the spring game. "He's played really well. He did a lot of nice things today. It's neck-and-neck right now without a doubt."
Much of the buildup during the spring had involved the quarterbacks, but neither was sharp during the spring game because of the wind. Murray completed just 11 of 21 passes for 85 yards and a touchdown and rushed nine times for 35 yards. Kendall completed 11 of 18 passes for 134 yards and a score.
Riley said the summer work both put in will be critical.
"We're going to have a ton of great film to go back through spring and evaluate what we've done well, what we need to do better," he said. "I think they're continuing to learn about our personnel. We'll continue to narrow down the personnel for them, which makes it easier. So, yeah. It's a process. We're just kind of in the middle of it right now."
REPLACING ANDREWS
Sophomore Grant Calcaterra will replace Mackey Award winner Mark Andrews at tight end. Calcaterra led the way with 59 yards and a touchdown receiving in the Spring Game.
"I'll just kind of step in and do exactly what he did," Calcaterra said. "I don't think they're going to change anything with the offence. I think I'll kind of step into that tight end role and continue to try and do what he did here and leave my mark as well."

A MEETING of state and federal water ministers on tomorrow in Canberra represents a pivotal juncture in the Murray Darling Basin Plan's implementation, to try and avoid damaging farming communities.
The ministerial council will decide whether to advance with about 35 water savings projects, to be tabled by the Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA), to try and deliver 650 gigalitres of the plan's base-line 2750GLs target in environmental water flows.
National Farmers' Federation water policy spokesman Les Gordon said the high level meeting represented an important stage in the process with the projects underpinning a “credible pathway” for delivering the 650GLs of ‘down water' in the Basin Plan.
But Mr Gordon said that was still “a long way” from the projects actually being delivered in a way that ensured farming communities didn't suffer further damage due to loss of productive water.
He said once the Basin governments agreed to the projects to compile the 650GLs component of the plan, a lot of work was then needed to develop the projects further and engage stakeholders and broader communities to ensure the projects are delivered “in a way that doesn't impact negatively on those communities”.
“To be honest, at the moment, our understanding of those projects is little more than a headline,” he said.
“We can see where they're going and what they're trying to achieve but there's very little ownership of it.
“However that's the next phase.
“The first step is to get the projects on the table and modelled and then agreed to by the end of the year and then the hard part is bringing along the stakeholders and communities, in terms of implementing the actual impacts.”
Mr Gordon said nobody really understood the detail of the projects, “because it's largely not there”.
He said what detail was available, hadn't been shared at any real level with the basin communities and stakeholders involved.
“That's the second phase and the first phase is to get the 650GLs signed-off and approved and accepted at a ministerial council and at the MDBA level which is due this Friday,” he said.
“All the projects had to be submitted before June 30 so this ministerial council meeting this Friday, is the end of the line.
“But these sorts of projects instinctively make us nervous especially when there's little known about them, so there's a bit of work to be done in that space in understanding what the likely impacts are and mitigating them.”
Mr Gordon said the worst outcome from the meeting was not getting sign-off on the 650GLs.
He said examples of projects to achieve the 650GLs included reconfiguration of Menindee Lakes in NSW which was that state government's “big ticket item”.
He said a project stakeholders needed to understand more about and was least understood is one called ‘hydro cues or natural flow cues'.
“It's really about using environmental water in such a way that piggy backs on existing events and reduces the need for water to produce particular outcomes,” he said.
“But we've said all along that this is about achieving outcomes other than just water flows, which is more important at this part of the process, than any other time.”
“About 35 projects are being touted at this stage.
“This process was due to be complete about 12-months ago but the states were given more time to come up with new projects.”
National Irrigators Council; CEO Steve Whan said he welcome the COAG meeting's endorsement last week of the independent socio economic study as part of the 450GLs ‘up-water component' of the Basin Plan and endorsement of the continuing work on Sustainable Diversion Limit (SDL) adjustment measures.
But he said this week's meeting was “far more important” for basin communities at it had the “critical task” of signing off on the list of SDL adjustment measures to be assessed, and was a “key milestone” to provide more understanding of whether the 650GLs of SDL adjustments would be achieved.
Mr Whan said there was now “substantial evidence” to show that water buybacks have had very negative impacts on Basin communities and the meeting contained a critical step in potentially achieving 650GLs of the Basin Plan's target without negative impacts on communities.
“It might not seem like a big deal but it is a critical step on the way to achieving the Basin Plan and if it doesn't happen it could put the brakes on the process entirely,” he said, about reaching agreement to advance the efficiency measures.
“NIC would also hope Ministers might discuss and come to some agreement on the Northern Basin Review, the assessment by the MDBA shows that the proposed changes from this review have no measurable impact on the Southern Basin and South Australia and they have no impact on achieving environmental objectives.
“The socio-economic assessment by the MDBA in the Northern Basin showed that taking water from productive use had conclusively hurt communities with hundreds of families affected by job losses.
“Irrigators didn't get all we wanted out the Northern Basin review but it is certainly better than the status quo.
“It should be made absolutely clear that adjusting the SDL target in the Northern Basin and looking at the way ‘up-water might be delivered is entirely consistent with the Plan as agreed by parliament in 2012.”

PRESS RELEASE – “THE increased severity of dengue and the occurrence of new viruses that have swept through the region tell us we have a gap in regional health security where vector-borne diseases are concerned. This year, we had storms that were unprecedented. We are expected to see more monster storms which will cause disruption, including making the environment more favourable for vectors. Hence the need for integrated vector management and looking at some of the new tools that are available.”
These were the words of Dr. C. James Hospedales, Executive Director of the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA), as he spoke at the opening ceremony of the Integrated Vector Management (IVM) coordinated by the Agency.
The meeting was held from December 5-6 at the Trinidad Hilton and Conference Centre and brought together participants from 27 English-, French-, Dutch- and Spanish-speaking countries in the region to review and discuss the adaptation of standardized protocols for improved vector surveillance, including insecticide resistance testing. The meeting engaged regional vector control managers in discussions related to the adaptation and use of a IVM toolkit in national vector control programmes.
The transmission of vector-borne diseases is strongly influenced by demographic, social and environmental factors, resulting in the emergence and re-emergence of yellow fever, malaria and dengue — and more recently, the emergence of Chikungunya and Zika in the region.
In his welcome remarks, Dr. Edwin Bolastig, Advisor Health Systems and Services, PAHO/WHO Country Office, Trinidad and Tobago said, “Vector-borne diseases claim more than 700,000 lives every year. The burden is highest in tropical and sub-tropical areas such as the Caribbean. Unplanned urbanization and lack of a reliable pipe water supply or solid waste management can render large populations at risk of mosquito-borne diseases.
“Despite these challenges, most of these diseases can be prevented through vector control, if it is planned and implemented well and sustained. The success of response to the growing threat of VBD will depend on strong country leadership, enhanced advocacy, resources mobilisation and coordination among partners.
“This workshop is very timely, and your discussions will be important in strengthening your national vector control programmes, preventing and controlling vectors and ultimately protecting the health of your populations against the vector borne diseases.”
Monica Paul-McLean, Programme Manager, European Union Delegation, also spoke at the opening of the workshop. She spoke about the collaboration between the EU and CARPHA geared towards contributing to efforts to improve the public health of the Caribbean people and outlined the EU's support to CARPHA since 2013.
She said: “CARPHA has been working to strengthen health systems across the region to better monitor, prevent and control Zika and other mosquito-borne diseases. The EU has pledged to continue to support health systems strengthening for prevention and control of epidemics and mosquito-borne diseases in the Caribbean. It is our aim to continue to work hand in hand with Caribbean countries towards the achievement of healthy lives for people of all ages, thus contributing to the attainment of SDG 3: good health and wellbeing – which we are all committed to achieve by 2030.”
“I am pleased to witness another significant step towards the reduction and eventual eradication of vector-borne diseases in Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean region and eventually globally,” stated Terrence Deyalsingh, Minister of Health Trinidad and Tobago, in his feature address.
Deyalsingh added that tyres thrown into the environment become the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. It is concerning to note that many of the vector-borne diseases we currently struggle with today can be prevented through informed protective measures which can be undertaken by members of the public. He urged participants to collaborate further with agencies such as the European Union and CARPHA to get mosquito-borne diseases under control. In closing, the Minister applauded CARPHA for their efforts and for being proactive.
During the workshop funded by the European Union, new tools and technologies for vector control were highlighted and a plenary session on Opportunities for Strengthening Vector Control in the Caribbean took place on the final day of the workshop. Participants also discussed the progress of the Caribbean Vector-Borne Disease Network (CariVecNet) which was launched in Cuba this year.
CARPHA's IVM Toolkit is designed to be used by vector control programme managers as a guide in the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of an IVM approach. The Toolkit also provides information on common mosquito vectors and vector-borne diseases in the Caribbean and the tools for vector control operations within the IVM context.

In about a month from the time this article is posted the New Jersey Devils will be starting training camp in preparation for the 2017-18 season. After a miserable season that saw them finish in the bottom of the Eastern Conference there were many changes to be made on the roster and GM Ray Shero subtracted and added a lot of players this summer. The franchise was also gifted with the number one overall pick in the 2017 NHL Draft when they won the draft lottery and vaulted from the sixth pick to the first, where they selected Nico Hischier.
Following New Jersey's Development Camp in early July Hischier signed his entry-level deal before heading back to his native Switzerland for the summer. His addition to the franchise has given them a shot of adrenaline to their rebuild as Shero and coach John Hynes look to get New Jersey back to the playoffs for the first time since 2012.
Make no mistake about it – Hischier will be given every chance to make the team's opening night roster and that possibility was made more likely when the Devils did not bring back a plethora of forwards from last year's group. It would be a shock if he wasn't on the team from jump street and throughout the entire season.
Since there's not much going on with New Jersey for the next month — other than agreeing to terms with restricted free agent defenseman Damon Severson — we decided to take a guess at what the roster could look like when they make their season debut on October 7 against the Colorado Avalanche at the Prudential Center.
Forwards:
Let's consider that Taylor Hall, Adam Henrique, Kyle Palmieri, Marcus Johansson, Travis Zajac, Brian Boyle and Pavel Zacha are all locks to be there opening night, which leaves six to seven spots available. Adding Hischier to this group, and Miles Wood (barring a regression) sets up a heavy battle for the final four or five forward spots.
Included in that battle will probably be Stefan Noesen, John Quenneville, Joe Blandisi, Michael McLeod, Blake Speers, Blake Coleman, Kevin Rooney and Nick Lappin. As of now, the Devils haven't announced any players coming to training camp on a PTO.
Noesen, Blandisi, and Quenneville saw enough time at the end of last season that they should have what it takes to win a spot and it appears that McLeod and Speers are ready to make the jump from juniors to the NHL, but don't sleep on Rooney or Lappin nabbing one of the final spots. Those two players are pretty well seasoned in playing against men after a season in the AHL and each has also had a taste of the NHL game.
With that here are the 14 forwards we think will be there on October 7:
Hall-Hischier-Johansson
Henrique-Zacha-Palmieri
Quenneville-Zajac-McLeod
Wood-Boyle-Noesen
Speers, Blandisi
Defense:
The puzzle is a little easier to solve on the Devils' blue line and we'll operate under the assumption that Severson gets a new contract and stays put. You can add his name to a group with Andy Greene, John Moore, Ben Lovejoy, and Steven Santini. That's five players and leaves us with only two spots to fill, setting up a competition amongst a handful of defenders.
Mirco Mueller, who was acquired from San Jose, will be given a good chance to win one of those spots as he battles with Dalton Prout, Yaroslav Dyblenko, Colton White, Colby Sissons and Michael Kapla.
Both Prout and Kapla have limited NHL experience like Mueller, while White and Sissons will be looking to make the jump over the AHL from juniors. White is a real dark horse pick here, as he has been with the organization for three years now and had his best development camp to date this year after a solid season in the OHL.
Here are the seven defensemen we think will be on the roster on October 7:
Greene-Severson
Moore-Santini
Mueller-Lovejoy
White
Goalies:
No drama. No intrigue. No question about it. With full confidence, we can say that the Devils two goaltenders come October 7 will be Cory Schneider and Keith Kinkaid.
(Reuters Health) - Omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplements may not help reduce the risk of heart problems in people already at high risk, a research review suggests.
The American Heart Association recommends eating at least two servings of fish a week and considering supplements of omega-3 fatty acids when that's not possible. Previous research has linked omega-3s to a lower risk of abnormal heartbeats, fewer fats in the blood, reduced risk of artery-clogging deposits known as plaque, and slightly lower blood pressure.
For the current study, researchers examined data from 10 trials with a total of 77,917 participants with a previous heart attack or stroke or health problems like diabetes. Most had been randomly assigned to take either omega-3 fatty acid supplements or a placebo, or dummy pill, for at least one year.
Overall, participants were 64 years old on average when they joined the trials, and they were followed for an average of 4.4 years. During follow-up, 2,695 people (3.5 percent) died from heart disease, while 2,276 (2.9 percent) had nonfatal heart attacks, 1,713 (2.2 percent) had strokes and 6,603 (8.5 percent) had procedures to reopen clogged arteries.
Risks for these outcomes were the same whether or not people took omega-3 fatty acid supplements, researchers report in JAMA Cardiology.
“The results . . . demonstrated no beneficial effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplements for prevention of cardiovascular disease, overall, or on any subtype of cardiovascular disease, or on cardiovascular disease in any subgroup of the population,” said senior study author Dr. Robert Clarke, a public health researcher at the University of Oxford in the UK.
“Thus, the results . . . provide no support for the current guidelines of the American Heart Association that advocate that patients with prior coronary heart disease take omega-3 fatty acid supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease,” Clarke said by email.
Most of the trials in the current study included different doses and combinations of two omega-3s: EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). Across the trials, people took these supplements for an average of one to six years.
While taking these supplements appeared tied to a slightly lower risk of death from heart disease, nonfatal heart attacks, and all coronary heart disease events, the differences in each case were too small to rule out the possibility that they were due to chance.
One limitation of the study was the wide variation in study designs for the randomized trials, the authors note. Another drawback is the lack of data on smoking status or detailed cancer history for individual participants, both of which might independently impact the odds of developing heart disease or dying from it.
Even if there isn't overwhelming evidence that omega-3 supplements protect against heart disease, it still may be a reasonable choice for patients because the supplements are inexpensive and safe with virtually no serious side effects, said Dr. Carl Lavie, medical director of the cardiac rehabilitation program and preventive cardiology at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute at the University of Queensland School of Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana.
“So the evidence for omega-3 does not have to be nearly at the same level of expensive and risky medications and devices,” Lavie, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. “The fact is that a lot of our patients who oppose many therapies are very happy to use things like omega-3 supplements, and this should not be ignored.”
People already taking omega-3 supplements shouldn't stop, and there are other reasons beyond just heart health to consider this option, said Dr. Dominik Alexander, a researcher at the EpidStat Institute in Ann Arbor, Michigan, who wasn't involved in the study.
“In addition to maintaining a healthy body weight, habitually engaging in physical activity, and not smoking, consumers should regularly eat fatty fish as part of a well-balanced diet or supplement their diets with a high quality omega-3 supplement,” Alexander said by email. “The heart health benefits are well documented, and there may be other important health benefits as well, including memory, cognition and eye health.”

NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday hiked the minimum support price ( MSP ) for paddy by a steep Rs 200 per quintal as it looked to fulfill its poll promise to give farmers 50 per cent more rate than their cost of production.The decision, taken by the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , comes less than a year before next general election.While the BJP had promised in 2014 to give farmers a price of 1.5 times of cost, an announcement to give effect to the promise was made in the government's fifth and final annual Budget presented on February 1 this year.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs ( CCEA ) at its meeting today approved the MSP of 14 Kharif (summer-sown) crops.According to sources, the MSP of paddy (common grade) has been increased by Rs 200 to Rs 1,750 per quintal, while that of Grade A variety by Rs 160 per quintal to Rs 1,750.The MSP of paddy (common) was Rs 1,550 per quintal and Rs 1,590 per quintal for paddy (grade A) variety. The MSP of cotton (medium staple) has been increased to Rs 5,150 from Rs 4,020 and that of cotton (long staple) to Rs 5,450 from 4,320 per quintal.In pulses, tur MSP has been raised to Rs 5,675 per quintal from Rs 5,450, and that of moong to Rs 6,975 per quintal from Rs 5,575. Urad MSP has been hiked to Rs 5,600 from Rs 5,400 per quintal.Hike in paddy MSP will increase the food subsidy bill by over Rs 11,000 crore based on procurement figure of the 2016-17 marketing year (October-September).The Food Corporation of India (FCI), the government's nodal agency for procurement and distribution of foodgrains, buys wheat and rice from farmers at MSP and supply the grains under the food security law.Paddy is the main kharif (summer sown) crop, the sowing of which has already begun with the onset of southwest monsoon.Earlier, sources had said that the MSP rate proposed by the agriculture ministry is higher than the government's farm advisory body CACP, considering growing farm distress because of fall in prices of most crops, owing to bumper production.India is estimated to have harvested a record foodgrains production at 279.51 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) on all-time high output of rice, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses.The announcement of higher MSP coupled with forecast of normal monsoon this year could further boost foodgrains output. However, the higher support price could also fuel food inflation.

Mount Eerie's Phil Elverum will release a double-vinyl live album this Fall titled, After. In the latest episode of This Must Be the Gig, the Pacific Northwest singer-songwriter details the forthcoming collection to host Lior Phillips, namely how it was surreptitiously recorded during his critically acclaimed performance at last year's Le Guess Who? Festival in Utrecht, Netherlands.
Here's how it all happened:
“A recording emerged from that show, and I remember it being particularly good and huge. It was kind of the best show of that tour. I'm putting a live album of that. So, the recording turned out really good, which was strange because I don't really like live albums and I don't really want people to record my shows really.
I'm not uptight about it, but I really believe it should be a thing that happens and then it's forgotten. Like it's a thing that we're all in the room together for, and so I did say, ‘No recording,' but then somebody in the crew recorded it, either without them not knowing I didn't want them to or just because, and I'm so glad they did because the show was so special and the sound was so good.
It was this huge cathedral, so it was epic sounding, but not too epic. It's called After. That was one of the possible titles for A Crow Looked at Me. It seemed appropriate for this live album because it truly is a document of that strange in between space after the cataclysm, before things have settled … after a death or after an album. The live show.”
Phillips actually reviewed the performance for Consequence of Sound, writing, “From the first lines, tears permeated the pews, sniffling and strained breathing the norm throughout the remainder of the performance. Elverum, meanwhile, hung lightly on his toes, rarely wavering in his vocal tone and never missing a guitar strum, yet more fragile and considered than bold.”
Stay tuned for further details on the album. In the meantime, stream the full interview below in which Elverum also reflects on the impact of death, the value of heavy metal, and how his family owned a pet gorilla. It's an incredible hour.

This Friday marks graduation day for Ripon High School's seniors. This year's graduating class has just over 200 students, and they are a diverse group. The 2018 graduates include wrestling, soccer, and track stars, swimmers, and golfers. There is a magician, a $20,000 scholarship winner, an entrepreneur opening her own store in Copperopolis, and a teen mom graduating on time with plans to attend college in the fall. Many in this driven tribe of movers and shakers will be moving on to four year programs at schools such as Humboldt State and Menlo College, or starting their college years locally at Modesto Junior College.
But what did Ripon High's graduating class look like 100 years ago? For starters, it was much smaller. The Ripon Union High School (as it was known back then) only had nine graduating seniors, eight of them women. Graduation day in 1918 was near the tail end of World War I, and the school's yearbook was dedicated “To all the Boys [sic] who have left the school to fight for Uncle Sam”. It makes one wonder how large the class would have been had the war not happened, and how many of the seniors' classmates were lost.
Much like today's seniors, the 1918 class participated in familiar activities like debate, drama and athletics. They harassed the incoming freshman, although the methods have hopefully evolved over the last hundred years as the yearbook claims the words “Kill the Freshies” were “written on every blackboard in the Assembly Hall”. Interestingly, each of the nine graduating seniors, all chose to pursue some form of education for their future careers.
The 1918 yearbook also includes a “prophecy” section, where each senior wrote out a rather fantastical and occasionally hilarious idea of what they thought would happen to them in the future. Each entry was written in the past tense, as if by someone in the distant future was recording events from the past. Entries included Miss Nessie Henry's stating she was the originator of a bookkeeping system that made her millions before she turned 40, at which point she retired to a Sonoran estate where she raised “pink-eared Japanese cats”, as well as Miss Flora House's which stated she married a Riponite who was wounded in the war. Following this, they relocated to Half Moon Bay to take up onion gardening, at which point Miss Flora authored two books, “Scents From My Garden”, and “The Onions Of Half Moon”. It is good to note that despite the somber time and circumstances in which they lived, the graduates were able to keep their senses of humor and positive outlook.
Despite the weighty issues that war brings, there seems to have also been some pettier drama that the 1918 graduates dealt with. A Ripon Record article from May of 1918 alludes to the high school year not being “the success all hoped for”, and then mentioned as the “probable cause of its failure, a lack of harmony, petty jealousy, and too much talk and too little action”. One can only speculate as to what happened, as the rest of the article urges the reader to move on from the year, and then discusses how both the war and farm work have caused low enrollment in all of the area schools.
While one hundred years have passed since these nine seniors graduated, and the landscape in Ripon has certainly changed, some things remain the same. It appears cheeky attitudes, teenage drama, and youthful ambition have stood the test of time. Come support Ripon's youth this Friday as they march for their diplomas in Stouffer Field, before they embark on the next phase of their journeys through life.

ISLAMABAD, Feb 15 (APP): The 148th death anniversary of classical Urdu and Persian poet Mirza Ghalib was observed on Wednesday.
According to PTV news, Mirza Ghalib, the last great poet of the Mughal Era is considered to be one of the most popular and influential poets of the Urdu language.
Ghalib was born on December 27, 1797, in the city of Akbarabad (present Agra). His full name was Mirza Asadullah Baig Khan and Ghalib was his pen name.
He wrote several Ghazals during his life which have since been interpreted and sung in many different ways by different people.
Ghalib started composing poetry at the age of 11. His first language was Urdu but Persian and Turkish were also spoken at home. He got his education in Persian and Arabic at a younger age.
Mirza Ghalib was a gifted letter-writer. Not only Urdu poetry but the prose is also indebted to Mirza Ghalib.
His letters were very informal. Some times he would just write the name of the person and start the letter.
Mirza Asadullah Baig Khan Ghalib died on February 15 1869.
Toronto is under a special weather statement this weekend as up to 10 centimetres of snow are expected across the region by Sunday evening, Environment Canada said.
The forecaster released a statement Saturday afternoon predicting that periods of snow would continue throughout the evening Saturday and during the day on Sunday.
“Snowfall amounts will not be heavy, but total weekend amounts may reach 10 centimetres,” the statement said.
The conditions will be aggravated by a drastic drop in temperature Sunday evening, from about 2 C, which is expected to be the daily high, to -13 C, which will be swept into the region by an Arctic cold front.
“A sudden drop in temperature from near the freezing mark may make snow-covered roads rather icy,” the weather agency said.
I'M sure that Michael Gove is delighted to be back at the heart of the Government. However, his appointment as Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs might appear something of an odd choice.
The urbane MP for Surrey Heath is not known for his love of green wellies. Indeed, he has been lambasted by many – including the co-leader of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas – as being entirely unequipped for the task ahead, sartorially or otherwise.
His record in the House of Commons suggests that he had no qualms about selling off ancient forests to housebuilders, and he was in favour of removing the issue of climate change from the geography curriculum in schools.
He replaces Andrea Leadsom, whose brief tenure in charge of Defra hardly set the world alight. At first glance, his appointment looks like a kind of desperate compromise by the Prime Minister to recruit as many experienced senior ministers to her side as possible for the tricky weeks ahead. She did, after all, sack him from his role heading up the Ministry of Justice in the previous administration.
She's not daft. It's better to have Gove onside than on the backbenches. The environment brief though? It's not one of the big-hitters like Foreign Secretary or Chancellor of the Exchequer. We might be forgiven for regarding it as a little less than exciting. That is where we would be wrong.
It has never been more vital to have the environment right at the forefront of the political agenda. Indeed, today is the very first National Clean Air Day, organised by the environmental change charity, Global Action Plan.
Across the UK's city centres, air pollution is having a major impact on our health, with dirty public air contributing to 40,000 deaths every year in the UK. This inaugural day of action aims to reinforce awareness of the legal limits for vehicle emissions and to help schools, hospital and community organisations with information and advice on protecting our health.
Children and the elderly are especially vulnerable. My own 11-year-old daughter suffers from awful breathing difficulties in the summer months and has been prescribed an inhaler to help.
I'll say that again. 40,000 people are known to die from the effects of air pollution every year. If this number of individuals lost their lives for any other reason, there would be a national outcry.
Concern for such environmental matters is particularly important as we enter the Brexit negotiations. Wherever we end up with Brussels, it is crucial that Britain has its own clear policies and legislation on every aspect. And this includes everything from those lethal vehicle emissions to farming, fishing, protection of rare species and preventing illegal fly-tippers from desecrating our beautiful countryside.
There isn't space here to list every single thing that would come under this remit, but don't be fooled. Leave campaigners might have attacked the EU for “bureaucracy” but it's likely that every single one of the rules it has laid down under the very broad banner of the environment will need amending or replacing with our own home-grown version. Somebody has to be in charge. It's a bigger brief than you might think.
And whatever you might also think of Gove's record at Education, where he caused political mayhem, you can't deny that he gets things done. Earlier this week he took to Radio 4's Today programme to set out his stall, telling listeners that he intends to listen to farmers. I hope that he does. If he upsets the farmers, they will make an irate NUT conference look like a teddy bears' picnic.
However, what this appointment will do is to bring the concerns of the countryside right into the heart of Westminster.
This is good. For too long now in Britain there has been a disconnect between town and country. It is a prime example of how divided we have become as a nation. And it has to be said there is a lot of ignorance on both sides. If Gove causes thorny shibboleths to be torn apart, at least we will be debating them amongst ourselves.
And in wider global terms, we all need to think about the future of the planet and the precious resources it provides to sustain human life. Food shortages. New ways of extracting energy from the earth and the skies. International accords on reducing carbon emissions falling down like dominoes. All of these form a serious, potentially life-threatening situation which should not be on the political back-burner for a moment longer.
I hope that this controversial appointment puts the environment on everybody's agenda. Like the very air that we breathe, we take it for granted. We shouldn't.

Fans of gaming, cosplay and comics are in for an absolute treat later this year when the annual Bristol Anime & Gaming Con returns to the city.
The jam-packed event will bring together people of all ages to enjoy a guilt-free geeky weekend of activities including masquerades, talent shows, quizzes, talks, gaming tournaments and much, much more.
Organisers say that “with dozens of planned activities, the only problem people will experience is not having enough time to do everything they want to,” and after looking at the schedule it looks like they might have a point.
Highlights across the weekend event, which will be held at the Future Inns hotel next to Cabot Circus in April, include live Anime performers, mass gaming tournaments to pit gamers head-to-head, a ‘Big Geek Quiz', UV parties and more.

The two cosplay contests will see a prize pool of up to £1,000 between them up for grabs and the top three placed winners from the masquerades will have the option of qualifying for the UK Cosplay Championship Finals at London Anime & Gaming Con, where they will join over 30 of the UK's best cosplayers who have qualified for the finals across the year.
A spokesman for the event said: “We seek to include everyone, so we have many events to get involved with including the Cosplay Auction where you put yourself up for bid to raise money for Epilepsy Action, the Cosplay Blind-Date to make friends or maybe find your valentines sweetheart before the big day and much more.
“From the serious and professional to the fun and silly, our cosplay events have something for everyone.”

Trinidad and Tobago National Senior Team coach Tom Saintfiet launched an extraordinary attack on four of his senior players today, as he accused Daneil Cyrus and Jomal Williams of arriving two hours to his live-in camp allegedly smelling of rum.
The Belgian coach also blasted Major League Soccer (MLS) players Joevin Jones, who was initially included in his 20-man squad for this week's Gold Cup playoff matches against Suriname and Haiti, and Kevin Molino for failing to show sufficient desire to represent their national team.
Saintfiet told the media that Cyrus and Williams were dropped on the spot while Jones was also replaced.
Club Sando forward Akeem Roach, Defence Force utility player Curtis Gonzales and Orange County Blues attacker Trevin Caesar were all recalled to replace them after they were initially cut from the squad on their return from Managua yesterday.
It means England-based midfielder Andre Boucaud is the only addition to the squad that faced Nicaragua twice last week and returned with a 2-1 loss and 3-1 triumph respectively. Boucaud is expected in Trinidad on Tuesday, roughly 24 hours before kick off against Suriname, after he received an extra day's grace to represent his club in England.
Saintfiet's leniency with his overseas-based players is unlikely to be lost on local Pro League and Caribbean club champs, Central FC, who were told to release their players and not use them for their own clubs. The subsequent stand-off led to goalkeeper Jan-Michael Williams and midfielders Nathaniel Garcia and Sean De Silva being omitted.
And although Garcia and Williams are free now—De Silva was injured at a national training session—and Saintfiet lost goalkeeper Marvin Phillip to injury, the coach ignored both players and again left them out of his squad.
Today, Saintfiet revealed internal problems with the players he did want.
“We selected 20 players [and] I have to say that three of the 20 players didn't show up,” said Saintfiet, who was joined today by assistant coach Russell Latapy for the first time. “Two of the players came one and a half hours too late in camp and had still decent smell of alcohol around [them]. That was Daneil Cyrus and Jomal Williams.
“Both were immediately sent home back to party but are replaced in squad.”
Cyrus stressed that he did not have any alcohol though and the coach was referring to Williams.
Jones, according to Saintfiet, was simply a no-show. The Belgian coach gave special dispensation to the Seattle Sounders player to skip the Nicaragua tour after complaining about fatigue.
“I spoke with him individually and he did not show up at all for the camp,” said the Belgian coach. “So I think he has no interest to help his country to qualify.”
Saintfiet was not impressed to discover that Jones played in two charity matches over the Christmas period, after he claimed to be too tired to represent his country. And, bizarrely, Jones also represented W Connection in a friendly match against Haiti last week.
“Joevin is here on holiday and Joevin played, two days ago, a friendly with W Connection against Haiti,” said Saintfiet. “So if his club had no problem with him playing a friendly match with a club where he is not registered, I see no problem why he cannot play for his national team…
“I had face to face communication with him. I said take a few days off and see you on January 1st. I told him where and when and which time [to enter] camp and he never called or informed us in any way that he would not show up.
“So I think he has no interest to help his country to qualify.”
Remarkably, all four players dropped by Saintfiet for disciplinary reasons since he took over the reigns as head coach are wholly or part-owned by W Connection.
Last week, defender Triston Hodge became the first player to be cut after he allegedly missed one training session, turning up late for camp and failed to win over the new coach with his demeanour.
Williams, who is on loan at Mexico second division club Murcielagos FC, was next today along with versatile Connection defender, Cyrus, who has 62 full international caps.
Williams started in Saintfiet's first game as Warriors head coach against Nicaragua on 27 December and came off the bench for the second contest in Managua. Cyrus featured as a substitute in both fixtures.
Connection are believed to have inserted a sell-in clause in their deal with Seattle, which entitles them to a slice of any revenue earned if the MLS club cashes in on Jones. Jones won the MLS Cup with Seattle last season and is Trinidad and Tobago's top scorer in the Russia 2018 World Cup qualifiers.
However, his commitment to the two island republic has been questioned before.
Hart cut Jones—along with Cyrus—for playing minor league football after skipping an international tour, supposedly due to fatigue, in September 2013. Jones was also fined by Hart for breaking camp to attend a boat party, alongside teammates Mekeil Williams and Molino, three days before a World Cup qualifier against Guatemala on 2 September 2016.
The background of the players at odds with successive national team coaches ought to alarm and embarrass Trinidad and Tobago Football Association (TTFA) president David John-Williams, since he is the co-founder of the W Connection team.
The national youth teams have not been spared such disciplinary issues either, as Connection teenager Isaiah Hudson abandoned the Trinidad and Tobago National Under-20 Team during their Caribbean Cup campaign last October.
Hudson's father, Brent Hudson, insisted that the Naparima College student was injured. However, National Under-20 coach Brian Williams denied this.
Arguably, John-Williams did not help Saintfiet's authority much when he publicly warned the coach, at his unveiling, that he would be sacked if he does not manage four points from World Cup qualifiers against Panama and Mexico on 24 and 28 March respectively.
But, thus far, the cringeworthy introduction does not appear to have inhibited Saintfiet much, as the coach has not been shy about imposing himself on the national squad. And, unlike almost everyone else at the TTFA, the new coach does not seem to be interested in holding secrets.
“[Molino] said he was not available [to play] for his country at that point in time,” said Saintfiet. “He told me he didn't feel motivated or ready for that. And later, I [heard] he played games at lower league or social level…”
The downside to Saintfiet's managerial style is he must now try to outdo Haiti with a notably weaker squad than Hart had last year when the Warriors fell 1-0 to the Haitians in a Copa America Centenario playoff in Panama.
And, after his bullish approach to his senior players and bravado in mentioning Connection during a broadside at Jones, this week's qualifiers may take on increased importance for the Belgian coach.
The Warriors face Suriname from 7pm on Wednesday at the Ato Boldon Stadium in Couva and then tackle Haiti on Sunday from 5pm at the same venue.
It would be some accomplishment if Saintfiet can lead the Warriors to two wins regardless of the patchiness of his squad. Arguably, his authority—on the training ground and in the corridors of power—can be significantly weakened if his current squad fails to deliver for him. Perhaps irretrievably so.
Whatever is written about Saintfiet when he does depart at Piarco, he certainly will not be remembered as dull.
Now, it is up to his present squad—which includes 37-year-old captain and right back Carlos Edwards and 35-year-old striker Cornell Glen—to prove that the coach can win football matches too.
Suriname would be a good place to start on Tuesday.

Lexus on Tuesday unveiled a redesigned ES that's set to rewrite everything that comes to mind when one normally thinks of the popular mid-size luxury sedan, so much so that it may even fill the role of the GS whose sales pale in comparison to the current ES.
The new ES reaches showrooms in September as a 2019 model and brings with it a sharp new look, a more dynamic platform, and the nameplate's first-ever F-Sport option.
The car is still based on a front-wheel-drive platform, in this case Toyota's GA-K modular design which has been crafted under the automaker's TNGA guiding principles of low weight and a low center of gravity. The GA-K platform is found in the latest Camry and Avalon. In fact, the 2019 ES is most closely related to the Avalon but benefits from extra reinforcements to improve its structural rigidity, and in turn its ride and handling.
2019 Lexus ES Enlarge Photo
Size is up compared to the outgoing model, with Lexus claiming an increase in length of 2.6 inches, an increase in width of 1.8 inches. It's lower by a fraction of an inch, just 0.2 inches. Lower and wider is definitely something we dig. The designers have also pushed the wheels closer to the corners by increasing the wheelbase by 2.0 inches to give the car a stance of a proper sport sedan.
Like its predecessor, the 2019 ES will be offered in ES 350 and 300h guises. The new ES 350 will be fitted with a 3.5-liter V-6 with 302 horsepower and 267 pound-feet of torque, with the engine mated to an 8-speed automatic and spinning the front wheels only.
2019 Lexus ES Enlarge Photo
In the ES 300h, a 2.5-liter inline-4 running the Atkinson cycle will be mated with an electric drive system for a total 215 hp and estimated fuel economy of 44 mpg combined. This powertrain also spins the front wheels only. Lexus is yet to announce if all-wheel drive will be available on either model.
As mentioned above, there will be an F-Sport option too. It will be available on the ES 350 and adds a rear spoiler, 19-inch wheels, adaptive dampers, and a Sport+ option for the driving modes selector. The latter dials things up on numerous dynamic elements including a system to enhance the sound of the engine.
2019 Lexus ES Enlarge Photo
Inside, there's all the luxury and craftsmanship you've come to expect from Lexus, including premium elements such as real wood and aluminum dash accents. The dash takes on a driver-focused look thanks to the center display screen, instrument panel and available heads up display all located in a tight cluster in the driver's field of view. Safety includes Lexus' latest electronic driver aids, including new bicyclist and enhanced pedestrian detection systems.
Despite falling demand for sedans, the ES remains an important nameplate for Lexus. It's the third most popular after the RX and NX crossovers, with sales in the U.S. in 2017 totaling just over 50,000 units. In contrast, the similar-sized GS managed less than 8,000 units and thus might not be replaced once the current model's run its course.
Pricing for the 2019 Lexus ES will be announced closer to the market launch this fall.
Lexus will present the car for the first time on Wednesday at the 2018 Beijing auto show. For more coverage, head to our dedicated hub.
“Pose,” like its own unsung heroes, is revolutionary.
FX's new drama devotes the kind of attention (and budget) that typically goes to conflicted straight male antiheros to the glittering grunge of New York City's ballroom scene circa 1987. It centers LGBTQ communities whose ambitions are so much bigger than the infinitesimal spaces society affords them. It weaves stories of triumph and steel will with the creeping terror of the AIDS epidemic that constantly reminded everyone that this one wild night could very well be their last. Its stars are lost queer teens, hopeless romantic sex workers, defiant trans matriarchs.
There's simply never been a show on TV quite like “Pose” – a fact that “Pose” knows, relishes, and celebrates.
“Pose” is also notable for being the last original series that uber-producer Ryan Murphy will produce for FX before launching a new empire at Netflix. “Pose's” devotion to queer spectacle makes for a fitting final note, especially given Murphy's purported business ethos of extending a hand beyond his own experiences to lift up others that would have a much harder time getting noticed without him. For one, Murphy co-created “Pose” with frequent producing partner Brad Falchuk and newcomer Steven Canals, whose script about New York's queer scene couldn't get made before Murphy signed on. For a significant other, “Pose” takes the rare extra step of having its trans characters be played and written by trans people who can actually speak to the experiences they're portraying. (Episodes three and four are credited to “Transparent” writer Our Lady J and author Janet Mock, making her TV writing debut with “Pose.”)
Some will undoubtedly recognize “Pose's” ballroom jargon from the seminal 1990 documentary “Paris is Burning,” whose influence is all over the series. Far more, however, will know now ubiquitous phrases like “throwing shade” and “snatching wigs” from the pop culture juggernaut that is “RuPaul's Drag Race,” the reality competition show that brought drag to the masses in 2009. While RuPaul knows he's referencing ballroom emcees when kicking off every episode's runway portion with “category is …”, it's unlikely that many younger viewers have any idea that their favorite “Drag Race” catchphrases were actually coined decades ago by queer and trans people of color whose ingenuity could make even the dingiest of spaces come alive. “Pose” aims to make that oft-buried history vibrant and current, with all the glitter and heft that FX can give it.
As “Pose's” Blanca (MJ Rodriguez) puts it to wide-eyed newcomer Damon (Ryan Jamaal Swain) in the premiere, the ballroom scene made room for a “gathering of people who are not welcome to gather anywhere else, a celebration of a life that the rest of the world does not deem worthy of celebration.” Balls allowed the LGBTQ community to express the kind of glamorous creativity it couldn't elsewhere by staging elaborate and defiant spectacles of fashion, dancing, and exquisitely pointed wit. There, likeminded people could find each other, build communities as distinctive “houses,” and, more powerfully still, choose each other as family.
“Pose” introduces us to the unique magic of these chosen family dynamics by way of two competing “houses,” or collectives that band together in the name of solidarity and slaying ballroom challenges. The legendary House of Abundance is headed up by the statuesque Elektra (Dominique Jackson), who rules with a combination of killer cheekbones and acid disdain for anyone who would dare question her. The upstart House of Evangelista is born in the premiere when Blanca, once an Elektra devotee, strikes out on her own to make a name for herself and leave a lasting legacy while she still can. Elektra and Blanca disagree on most everything, but as transwomen fighting for the right to express and be themselves no matter the considerable cost, they begrudgingly respect each other's ambition.
While House of Abundance has legacy cachet, the House of Evangelista reigns supreme as far as “Pose's” most compelling storytelling goes. Damon's dance dreams take some time to coalesce as a narrative, but his fellow Evangelista recruit Angel (a luminescent Indya Moore) is instantly magnetic in her search for something, anything, resembling stability. Their new house mother Blanca is equal parts warm and determined as she becomes a strong backbone for both her fledgling house and the show itself. Rodriguez is especially good when paired with Billy Porter's Pray Tell, a gifted designer and ballroom emcee who makes it his mission to find joy in his community even as AIDS keeps tearing a devastating hole right through it.
“Pose” does make a glancing effort to include perspectives from outside the balls. Evan Peters takes a break from terrorizing innocents on Murphy's “American Horror Story” to costar here as restless ladder climber Stan, whose beautiful wife (Kata Mara) and fancy new job at Trump Tower ­(yes, that Trump Tower) still can't stave off his attraction to Angel's sparkling smile and earnest charm. James Van Der Beek (yes, that James Van Der Beek) occasionally shows up as Stan's oily caricature of a boss to encourage infidelity, snort cocaine, and proclaim “God bless Ronald Reagan.” Neither are particularly fascinating, but it bears repeating that on the vast majority of other TV shows out there, Peters and Beek would be the stars. On “Pose,” they're sidenotes.
In fact, given its sprawling cast of characters and perpetually swollen runtime (each of the first four episodes runs at least an hour long), “Pose” can sometimes feel like it's tackling everything all at once just because it can. But it proves just about impossible to hold “Pose's” ambition against it. In true House of Murphy tradition, “Pose” is blunt and opulent, confident in its individuality and palpably eager to please. Even when it stumbles, it's hard not to admire its electric spirit.

FRESNO, Calif. (AP)  Authorities will not recommend charges be filed against a central California criminal defense attorney who was under investigation after allegedly dropping off a box of contraband to a client at the Fresno County Jail.
The Fresno Bee reported Monday (http://bit.ly/2lLAJKe ) that Fresno County Sheriff's Office spokesman Tony Botti says attorney Tony Capozzi was cooperative when he met with detectives for an interview and that authorities will not recommend charges.
Capozzi came under investigation after an Oct. 11 incident where the attorney met with an inmate with a cardboard box filled with documents. Capozzi left the box with his client. It was later discovered that the box had a hidden compartment containing cellphones and over-the-counter medication.
Capozzi said Monday he was pleased with the investigation's conclusion.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China urged the United States to drop its “Cold War mentality” and not misread its military build-up, after Washington published a document on Friday outlining plans to expand its nuclear capabilities to deter others.
“Peace and development are irreversible global trends. The United States, the country that owns the world's largest nuclear arsenal, should take the initiative to follow the trend instead of going against it,” said China's Ministry of Defence in a statement on Sunday.
The review of U.S. nuclear policy has already riled Russia, which viewed the document as confrontational, and raised fears that it could increase the risk of miscalculation between the two countries.
The U.S. military has put countering China and Russia, dubbed “revisionist powers”, at the centre of a new national defence strategy unveiled earlier this month.
By expanding its own low-yield nuclear capability, the U.S. would deter Russia from using nuclear weapons, say American officials.
China accused the United States of “presumptuous speculation” about China's intentions, and said it has always adopted a restrained attitude towards the development of nuclear weapons and kept its nuclear forces to a minimum.
“We hope that the United States will abandon its Cold War mentality, earnestly assume its special disarmament responsibilities, correctly understand China's strategic intentions and objectively view China's national defense and military build-up...,” the ministry said in the statement posted on its website.
It called on the U.S. to work together with China and for their armies to become a stabilizing factor in Sino-U.S. relations and in the region.
SHEFFIELD STEELERS owner Tony Smith hailed a new deal with its Sheffield Arena landlords - believing it will enable the club to implement more long-term initiatives.
The Steelers have signed a five-year deal with SIV, the company which as part of the not-for-profit Sheffield City Trust (SCT), runs the Arena that the South Yorkshire club have played at since it was launched back in 1991.
PARTNERSHIP: SIV's Dominic Stokes and Sheffield Steelers' owner Tony Smith, right.
Smith, who took over sole ownership of the Steelers seven years ago, said the new five-year agreement was a significant development given the club normally negotiated its use of the venue around short, 12-month contracts.
Now,with greater co-operation between both sides, Smith believes stronger, long-term plans can begin to see the light of day, something not possible under previous agreements with the venue.
“In the past, contracts have been short between both parties and maybe that has been down to the fragile ownership that came before my family took control seven years ago," said Smith. "We are now the longest ownership group in the club's history and coming with that long-term stability that we have bought is the confidence that the Arena and SIV have in us to deliver.
“In recent months we have already seen so much co-operation between both sides. This will continue and improve. The Arena is our home, it has been for 27 years and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.
“This is a good deal for the Steelers, a good deal for the Arena and SIV but - most of all - a good deal for those who come and support us in this great building."
Among the initiatives the two sides are working on are a commitment to improve the quality of the ice and address the issue of the ageing ice plant within the five-year term as well as the creation of a new merchandise store. The club and Arena owners are also keen to develop more community initiatives such as the forthcoming 'Skate with the Steelers' event at IceSheffield.
And in light of the Steelers attempts to bring the Continental Cup Final to South Yorkshire last month - the event was eventually held in Minsk - the club and the venue owners will look to bring major international hockey events to the city.
Dominic Stokes, who is responsible for all events & entertainment at SIV, added: "This marks the start of a new energy and enthusiasm by both parties to a relationship that has existed for the past 27 years."
3-Year-Old Girl From Ethiopia Killed at Her Birthday Party in Idaho Mass Stabbing

Girl slain in Boise stabbing “loved pink and Disney princesses”
BOISE, Idaho — The three-year-old Idaho girl who died from her wounds two days after a mass stabbing at her birthday party Saturday has been identified as an Ethiopian refugee “who loved pink and Disney princesses.” CBS Boise affiliate KBOI-TV reports Ruya Kadir is the victim who lost her battle to survive.
The station cites The International Rescue Committee, an organization providing support for the families involved in the stabbing.
IRC President and CEO David Hillbrand said in a statement, “Our caseworkers describe Ruya as a child who always sparkled when she walked into a room. She was her mother's princess, always the center of attention, and loved pink and Disney princesses. She had just turned three years old Saturday, and according to our IRC colleagues in Boise, was the epitome of sweetness.
“Ruya and her mother are Ethiopian refugees. They arrived in the U.S. in December 2015 and settled in Boise. Her father is in Turkey. Ruya's parents are enduring every parent's worst nightmare, which is made doubly cruel by the fact that they fled to America to escape conflict in Ethiopia. IRC had resettled the Kadir family in Boise. Our local team is doing everything possible to support the family – and the other refugees injured on Saturday – in this moment of extreme distress and fear.”
Authorities say a man invaded the birthday celebration and attacked nine people with a knife.
Timmy Kinner is accused of stabbing a group of children and the adults who tried to protect them at the party at an apartment complex that is home to many refugee families.
Word of the child's death came at Kinner's first court appearance, where Ada County Magistrate Judge Russell Comstock told him that he was charged with first-degree murder and other felonies in connection with the attack.
Comstock told Kinner he was “an extreme danger to the community” and ordered him held without bond.
Kinner is American, and the victims are members of refugee families from Syria, Iraq and Ethiopia. Boise Police Chief William Bones said the evidence doesn't suggest the attack was a hate crime.
The suspect had recently stayed at the apartment complex but was asked to leave Friday over bad behavior, Bones said.
Three of the stabbing victims were adults, the others children: the 3-year-old girl who died, two 4-year-olds, a 6-year-old, an 8-year-old and a 12-year-old…
Monday evening roughly 1,500 people turned out at a vigil honoring members of refugee families targeted in the stabbing.
People wept, sang and shouted their support for the refugee community, and many brought bouquets of white flowers intended to symbolize peace. By the end of the rally, hundreds of bouquets filled dozens of baskets on the steps of Boise's City Hall.
But community leaders told the crowd that what the survivors really need is money to cover rapidly growing medical bills and space at home to try to overcome the constant sense of unease they've experienced since the attack. Boise Mayor Dave Bieter and others urged community members to do what they can to help.
Signs were dotted throughout the crowd, some reading “love wins” and “we are all immigrants.”
Younis Kamel, a 16-year-old who moved to Boise from Iraq, and his 23-year-old sister Zuzu Kamel held up a more poignant sign:
“I will never forget seeing my friend getting stabbed in front of me,” the sign read. Younis Kamel was at the apartment complex the night of the attack.
Another woman held a sign reading “Justice for Teeba,” with a photo of a young child in a hospital bed, a breathing tube obscuring part of his face with half a dozen other tubes and medical devices connected to his body.

Detroit Tigers shortstop Dixon Machado is unable to catch the throw to the bag as Texas Rangers' Rougned Odor steals second in the sixth inning. (Photo: Tony Gutierrez, Associated Press)
Arlington, Texas — Making his first start in 14 days, there was bound to be some rust. There was — roughly 64 pitches and four innings worth.
That's how long it took for Tigers starter Michael Fulmer to start looking like himself Monday, and by then, irrevocable damage had been done and the Tigers were on their way to a 6-2 loss to the Texas Rangers.
The Tigers are 2-8 since they ran off four straight wins at the start of this month.
The emotional highlight for the Tigers came in the fifth inning when Ian Kinsler and manager Brad Ausmus were ejected by home plate umpire Angel Hernandez.
BOX SCORE: Rangers 6, Tigers 2
Hernandez called strike one on Kinsler on a pitch that replays showed to be well low of the strike zone. On the second pitch, a ball, Kinsler turned and said something snarky and was ejected.
He then pointed at Hernandez with his bat, at close range, and proceeded to get his money's worth verbally. Ausmus interjected quickly and earned his third ejection of the season.
That was as much fire as the Tigers mustered.
By the time Fulmer pitched a clean, 11-pitch fifth inning, he had allowed five runs on seven hits and three walks. He was at 75 pitches and done for the night.
Just off the disabled list (right ulnar neuritis), Fulmer walked the first two batters he faced and both would score — on a single by Nomar Mazara and a sacrifice fly by Adrian Beltre — in a 27-pitch first inning.
The first two batters reached in the second inning, as well, this time on singles. With Drew Robinson at the plate and missing a bunt attempt, catcher James McCann caught Rougned Odor off second base and threw behind him.
Odor broke for third.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos, charging on the bunt attempt, hesitated slightly and didn't get back to cover third base in time to take the throw from shortstop Jose Iglesias. It was a stolen base for Odor, and he scored on a safety squeeze bunt by Delino DeShields.
Joey Gallo hit a 428-foot home run to center field in the third, and Odor doubled and scored on a single by Robinson in the fourth.
Right-hander Jeff Ferrell gave up a run in the sixth. Again, it was Odor who stirred things up. He got his third hit of the game, stole second and went to third on McCann's throwing error. He scored on a single by Robinson Chirinos.
Right-hander Drew VerHagen, newly assigned to the Tigers bullpen, pitched two scoreless innings.
Once upon a time in this game the Tigers held a 2-0 lead. Justin Upton hit his 23rd home run, a two-run shot onto the berm in center field in the first inning. The bats went still after that.
Rangers starter Martin Perez put up zeros from the second through the sixth inning, then a trio of relievers locked it down from there.
Right-hander Ricky Rodriguez, making his major-league debut, pitched a scoreless seventh inning, striking out McCann and Alex Presley. Righty Matt Bush pitched a scoreless eighth.
In the ninth, the Tigers loaded the bases and had the tying run at the plate with two outs against Alex Claudio, a side-winding lefty. John Hicks, McCann and Iglesias singled. But Dixon Machado, who took over after Kinsler was ejected, struck out to end the game.
Mikie Mahtook continued his hot hitting. He delivered three singles, raising his average to .306.

Since the NFL draft, the energy surrounding the Cleveland Browns has been clearly felt, seen and heard. There are whispers (even shouts), that the team might find themselves in the playoffs for the first time since 2002.
There are five players who will likely have enough impact to propel Cleveland to that sweet playoff spot.
While we're almost certain Baker Mayfield is the future of the Browns, we must acknowledge Tyrod Taylor as the present. He has won games. He started 43 games for the Buffalo Bills over three seasons and threw 51 touchdowns. There's no reason to think he can't perform at that level in Cleveland. Taylor's work ethic is both admired and respected by teammates and coaches – both past and present. His professionalism and grit can't be faulted. This season, he has the opportunity to prove he still deserves to be QB1 for the foreseeable future. If all goes according to plan, the Browns will win games and Mayfield will have an extended learning period behind Taylor.
Think back to 2013 when Josh Gordon led the league in receiving yards (1,646). He had five games with 150 or more receiving yards. Fast forward through the next five years and we remember Gordon was suspended for 54 out of 64 games. Gordon has promised he's on the straight and narrow, with his mantra being that he's given each day, and each day, he must make it a good day. Pat McManamon of ESPN believes that even if Gordon returns to two-thirds of his former self, the Browns will have an excellent receiver. However, Gordon himself aims to exceed others' expectations together with his own goals. If Gordon continues to strive for excellence, the offense could change dramatically – and in a good way.
Denzel Ward – Cornerback
The Browns needed a speedy cover corner – and that Denzel Ward is just that. Defensive coordinator Gregg Williams knew Cleveland's defense was miserably lacking a solid cover specialist who could also run. Ward in the off-season has thus far proven that he's capable of playing immediately. Williams is confident Ward has the mental and physical ability to significantly contribute. “From an intelligence standpoint, it is not very hard because he just has to count to one and cover the guy that is the first one in from the sideline. Now, from an ability standpoint, that is another thing, but he fits in ability-wise. He has covered some awfully good guys.” Ward will be heavily depended on when the Browns face Pittsburgh's Antonio Brown and Cincinnati's A.J. Green – and that's just from the AFC North.
Missing five games last year disguised the fact that Myles Garrett did have a solid rookie season. Seven sacks in 11 games isn't an accurate representation of the numbers he can rack up as an edge defender when he's at full health. Pro Football Focus even rated him third among rookie edge defenders (top 20 overall) with 37 total pressures from 300 passing snaps and a pass-rush productivity of 10.2. If he remains injury-free, the 2018 season may be the year he truly breaks out.
Garrett is excited about Emmanuel Ogbah and what they're both capable of when working together. Like Garrett, Ogbah was injured in 2017 (broken foot) – but whenever he's on the field, he produces in a big way. Ogbah is a fast and effective pass rusher, and when he's present, ends the possibility of double-teams on Garrett. Cleveland's defense benefits immensely from his abilities. Garrett has high hopes for both of them. “I just think with how well we work together whether it's inside or on the outside rush… I think we can go for a pretty historic year.”
The wonderful thing about the Browns this season is the fact that these five players aren't the only ones who are expected to make a big impact on the success of the team. Expect a significant turnaround for the franchise this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Chelsea coach Antonio Conte berated his players for losing their composure after new captain Gary Cahill saw red on Saturday, and said he would be working on new formations using only 10 men.
The champions slumped to a 3-2 opening day defeat against unfancied Burnley, shipping three goals in the first half after Cahill was sent off for a dangerous tackle.
"It was a key moment. After this red card we lost our composure," the Italian told reporters.
"We must pay attention and try to keep our heads the rest of the game. Instead we conceded three goals and despite a good second half performance it was difficult to change the result."
Conte, looking tired and disgruntled, said he preferred not to talk about the referee who also sent off Cesc Fabregas in the 82nd minute after the Spaniard earned a second yellow card for an ill-timed tackle on former Chelsea man Jack Cork.
Conte paused and thought long and hard when asked about referee Craig Pawson's decisions, then said: "I think that the coach can make mistakes, the players can make mistakes, the referee..."
Conte said his halftime team talk, which along with the introduction of new striker Alvaro Morata who scored on his debut, appeared to completely transform the game, involved pointing out how the players had panicked and lost their shape.
"I like to tell always the truth and in the second half we changed totally the situation. We didn't lose the balance and we tried to change the final result."
Conte returned to his mantra from last season that the team needed to work hard to produce results and he pointed out that Chelsea had finished their last three games without all 11 of their players on the pitch.
"Also I have to study a new formation with 10 men, because when it happens with this regularity I must be worried."
Morata, he said, was working hard on his fitness and on adapting to Conte's system.
He brushed aside questions about reported tension with Chelsea's board over signing new players and said he was not worried because three key players - Eden Hazard, Pedro and Victor Moses - could return from injury and suspension for Chelsea's next game against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley.
"I'm not worried because we have to trust in our work ... In the next game I'm not sure whether Pedro is ready but for sure we'll have (the other) two players. We'll find the right solution."
Asamoah Gyan Found Guilty Of Unethical Hairstyle In UAE
If Asamoah Gyan and Omar Abdulrahman have been found guilty of having unethical hair, then what happens if Marouane Fellaini moves to the UAE Arabian Gulf League.
In one of the most bizarre stories we've come across in recent weeks, former Sunderland striker Gyan (pictured above) is among 46 players who have been found to breach UAE league rules on appropriate hairstyles.
Gyan is currently sporting a mohawk style cut and is guilty of sporting a ‘Qaza' hairstyle, which include mohawks, because only part of the head is shaved, leaving other parts unshaven.
UAEFA Disciplinary Committee have also deemed that Omar Abdulrahman's haircut does not fit the new criteria for ethical haircuts:
Middle Eastern football site Ahdaaf explained the situation on Twitter, and we are all slightly confused:
Its left us all scratching our heads.
Paul Pogba definitely won't be moving to the Arabian Gulf League anytime soon.
Ahdaaf tweeted: ‘UAEFA Disciplinary Committee deem that Omar Abdulrahman's haircut does not fit the new criteria for ethical haircuts in the#AGLeague.'
They added: ‘This comes after a new law by the UAEFA which states that players have to abide by certain guidelines for haircuts.#AGLeague.'
'46 other players in the #AGLeague, amongst them Leonardo and Asamoah Gyan, were also amongst the list of players who had unethical haircuts.'
