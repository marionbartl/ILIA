Addiction isn't vaguely defined, not really. There is a distinct line that must be crossed for chemical dependence to take over the brain's reward centers, past which the continued use of some or another drug (or behavior) becomes rooted in avoidance.
No longer is a user hunting for a dopamine kick; instead, they begin running from a lack of dopamine. The neuro-hunter becomes the hunted; desire for good feelings becomes an intense fear of bad feelings. If it's possible to know more about that line, what it is and how it's drawn, then it could be possible to "beat" addiction, and treat it at its root.
In less abstract terms, after a chemically-induced, unnaturally-large flood of dopamine, mechanisms in addiction sufferers begin to withhold the chemical from their brains, leaving neurons "dry." The result is pain of every sort: panic attacks, nausea, anxiety, sickness—​just collect all the things you might consider "bad feelings" and imagine them packaged together and shoved up your spinal column. It's a model that views addiction and withdrawal as much the same thing, two sides intertwined on a neurochemical strange loop.
It's been known for some time that the root of withdrawal misery is a lack of dopamine in the brain, which researchers have been able to demonstrate occurs as a defensive posture. Too much dopamine is actually damaging to synapses, encouraging oxidation.
This is the specific sort of neurotoxicity served by methamphetamine and its relatives (albeit at very high, sustained doses). Dopamine goes from being a feel-good friend to a thing literally tearing neurons apart. The neurotoxic effects of meth are so severe that a group of researchers is proposing its use in animals to model Parkinson's disease.
The brain is good at stuff, however, and in order to prevent further damage, it turns off the dopamine tap by producing a protein called BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor), which arrests dopamine production. The problem, however, is that it overcompensates, according to a study out this week from researchers at Brigham Young University. Rather than turn the switch back on after the dopamine flood recedes, the brain leaves it off, potentially for a very long time (so: withdrawal).
“I wouldn't be as motivated to do this research, or as passionate about the work, if I didn't think a cure was possible.”
The relationship of BDNF to dopamine isn't a new revelation, and the researchers have already successfully used the protein to turn drug-dependent behaviors "on" and "off" in rats. The experiment behind BYU's new contribution again took rats and switched off their receptors for BDNF, and then got them hooked on opiates.
What they found is that, over time, the rats developed new receptors for the protein via the processes of neural plasticity, essentially recreating the structures "necessary for both the establishment of an opiate-dependent state and aversive withdrawal motivation," the researchers wrote in the Journal of Neuroscience. The upshot is that the brain is remodels itself in response to substance abuse. This is addiction.
As such, BDNF and the processes that create it are powerful targets for an addiction "cure." This is what the research team's lead investigator, Scott Steffensen, sees in the discovery: "Addiction is a brain disease that could be treated like any other disease,” they said in a BYU statement. “I wouldn't be as motivated to do this research, or as passionate about the work, if I didn't think a cure was possible.”
The catch, however, is that addiction isn't limited to the mechanisms and chemicals in the brain that we call "addiction." We know well enough that it's closely related to mental illness, as well as all kinds of socioeconomic factors. Addiction is, in some ways, a symptom in itself. Roughly half of diagnosed schizophrenics drink or use drugs to excess, while nearly 60 percent of patients with bipolar disorder have some substance abuse in their history.
In this light, we might look at an addiction "cure" as actually just another method of treating the symptoms. No doubt the existence of such a method would be an overall good, but a reasonable concern is some future in which substance abuse is treated in an even less holistic manner that it is now.
If you've spent even a small amount of time in the trenches of substance abuse treatment, you know what goes into it. It's not a matter of treating just the drug or even the drug-specific behaviors; addiction is like a hydra, with different snarling heads burrowing into every aspect of a patient's existence. In essence, drug treatment becomes a matter of treating someone's life: work, family, living conditions, diet, and so on.
An on/off switch doesn't change the nature of addiction from a self-reinforcing, all-encompassing monster to a wound in need of stitches. The ability to turn off withdrawal symptoms would be a marvelous addition to the intervention of drug treatment. But a cure? It's not so easy.
German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt looks on during the cermony of appointment at Bellevue Castle in Berlin February 17, 2014. REUTERS/Tobias Schwarz
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has initiated a move to stop the growing of genetically modified crops under new European Union rules, documents seen by Reuters showed on Monday.
German Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt has informed German state governments of their intention to tell the EU that Germany will make use of new “opt-out” rules to stop GMO crop cultivation even if varieties have been approved by the EU, a letter from the agriculture ministry seen by Reuters shows.
A new EU law approved in March cleared the way for new GMO crops to be approved after years of previous deadlock. But the law also gave individual countries the right to opt out by banning GMO crops even after they have been approved as safe by the European Commission.
Widely-grown in the Americas and Asia, GMO crops have divided opinion in Europe. Britain is among those in favor of them, while France and Germany are among those opposed.
Previously, when the EU approved crops as safe to produce they had to be permitted for cultivation in all EU states.
In the letter, the ministry stressed that Schmidt is continuing a previously-announced policy to keep a ban on GMOs in Germany.
Under the new EU rules, countries have until Oct. 3, 2015, to inform the Commission that they wish to opt out of new EU GMO cultivation approvals, the ministry letter said.
Schmidt has asked German state authorities to say by Sept. 11 whether their region should be included in the opt-out, the letter said.

Baltimore's second attempt at a 72-hour cease-fire was cut short after midnight Saturday when police say an off-duty officer was fatally shot.
Metropolitan police Sgt. Tony Mason Jr. was struck inside a parked vehicle in Baltimore and was transported to a nearby hospital, where they later died from their wounds, police said.
Mason was a 17-year veteran of Washington's Metropolitan Police Department. A woman who was with Mason at the time of the shooting was also hit in the leg, but is expected to recover.
Baltimore police said they have launched an investigation into the shooting and the shooter remains unknown.
On Friday, Baltimore hit 300 homicides in 2017, according to police data, making this the third year in a row that the city has reached the grim milestone.
{snip}
According to The Baltimore Sun, more than 90 percent of the homicides in Baltimore are a result of shootings, and more than 90 percent of the victims have been black boys and black men between the ages of 18 and 30.
[Editor's Note: Baltimore's attempt earlier this year at a ceasefire also failed.]

Civilization can be conceived of as a linguistic virus whose sole goal is to mindlessly spread throughout an entire population. It has done nothing for us but come close to ensuring the ultimate annihilation of the human species. It has not solved a single “problem” without creating more problems –the endless, exponential and unchecked growth of human population, depletion of resources, and chronic depression, stress and anxiety. Its technological and “moral” “advancements” only give us the illusion of security and peace while threatening to wipe out or enslave not only humanity but most life on the planet. This satirical book mounts a scathing, caustic attack on all systems of belief founded on irrational assumptions and seeks to build a coherent philosophy based on logic and the comparative behavior of apex social mammals.

Aaaaaaand, it's sold!Based on the epic "Two Best Sisters play Portal 2" by 2snacks, completely without their knowledge or consent! Yay! ...ooooh. Right. Sorry 'bout that.Here's the link: [link] So! There it is! Finally! My first attempt at resin casting something pony! I've been working on and off (though mostly off) on this thing for months now, and I can say it's been educational. For instance I've learned that:1) If you're gonna try casting, decide so beforehand! Don't make a clay model on a whim, and then decide: "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if I could cast this in resin?"2) Alicorns are hard to make! They've got all horns and wings and tiaras and wavy manes and stuff. Yikes. Not good practise for a relative noob like me.3) I may have some kind of OCD. At one point you just have to say: "Ok, that's it, good enough is good enough."4) I'm a modeler, not an artist. A lifetime of reproducing tiny air- and spacecraft as accurately as possible have left me somewhat... artistically challenged. I'll have to work on that. Less Twilight, moar Rarity, so to speak.Anyway, down to specs: It's cast from polyurethane resin in a series of silicone molds that I made from a clay master. I wasn't really planning that at first. I started on a whim, without any real kind of plan, but as the clay models got more and more elaborate the idea of making silicone molds seemed super awesome. So in the end, I ended up cutting the clay master to pieces again when I finished, and made molds for the seperate parts. Put the finished parts together with glue, filler, then sanded and sprayed with primer.Sprayed Celestia with acrylic, Luna with model paint. Did Celestia's hair by hand. Painted the sofa with a course brush, painting several layers cross-wise to give it a textile look. Ended up pretty good. Basically, this whole thing was one big experiment, but I think it was a successful one.
ITS PERFORMANCE and agility have been likened to a motorcycle and now an Ariel Atom has been recruited by Somerset and Avon police to help educate motorcyclists, and reduce the number of bike accidents in the region.
Holder of various car performance records, the Atom has also beaten superbikes in track races. The model the police will be using, called the Atom PL1, is based on the latest Atom 3.5R. It has a supercharged Honda engine developing 350bhp and can accelerate from 0-60mph in a supercar-crushing 2.5sec.
It is being used by Somerset and Avon police, and Tri Force Specialist Operations, a borderless police support team, as part of the Safer Rider campaign. The idea is to send a cautionary message to motorcyclists as well as raise awareness of them, especially in the summer months when their numbers grow and accidents involving them increase.
Also read: Lamborghini donates £186,000 Huracan to Italian police
Andy Parsons, a roads policing sergeant with Tri Force, said: “Modern motorcycles are capable of extraordinary performance, with supercar levels of acceleration, braking and cornering. Unfortunately, with this level of performance comes an increased risk of death or serious injury as a result of inexperience, lack of training and rider error.”
The statistics are chilling. Motorcyclists make up just 1% of road traffic but account for nearly 20% of all road user deaths. A motorcyclist is around 35 times more likely to be killed in a road traffic collision than someone in a car.
The police want the Atom PL1 to make a big impact on bikers. To this end, it is fitted with Avon and Somerset livery, aerodynamic Hella pursuit lights and emergency equipment.
“I hope the use of the Ariel Atom PL1 will have a positive impact on road safety. To be safer, rider and machine need to work in harmony. When this happens it feels immediately right. When it doesn't, things go wrong.”
The Safer Ride campaign is being launched at Haynes Motor Museum, Sparkford in Somerset on Sunday June 8.

ABC investigation sparks ASIC probe into top mortgage fund
Updated
Sorry, this video has expired Video: Economics correspondent Stephen Long speaks to ABC News Breakfast (ABC News)
The corporate watchdog is investigating one of Australia's biggest mortgage fund operators for potentially false and misleading statements in the wake of a Four Corners investigation.
Gold Coast-based fund manager LM Investment, which operates in 70 countries and boasts of managing $3 billion of realisable assets, has made claims that one of its key funds is a "bank-like" facility and that it operates in Australia as a "conservative and highly rated private bank".
LM Investment is in fact a fund manager without any bank safeguards that operates mortgage funds subject to no prudential regulation.
Investors in its First Mortgage Income Fund and various other funds have lost hundreds of millions of dollars of capital, in some cases money that represented most of their retirement savings.
After the closure of failed funds in Australia, LM Investment has turned overseas and is heavily promoting the LM Managed Performance Fund in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.
At a recent seminar in Israel, the European development manager for LM Investment, former Goldman Sachs banker Simon Bottle, told investors and financial planners: "We are highly regulated in Australia. We are regulated twice. We are regulated as a private bank, and regulated as a fund manager."
Mr Bottle's CV says LM Investment operates in Australia as a conservative and highly rated private bank lender.
LM Investment has also sold its Managed Performance Fund to institutional investors overseas as a "bank-like facility". It says that claim was withdrawn as soon as it realised the potential for confusion.
The confusion regarding context was identified almost immediately and it was removed from circulation with an amended document forwarded to those who received the first, to eliminate any possibility that reference may be taken out of the context originally intended. LM Investment
LM is promoting its investment funds overseas on the strength of Australia's economy, best practice financial regulation, and world-class banking system.
Told of the claims by Four Corners, the chairperson of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), Greg Medcraft said: "I think that that is quite interesting ... thank you for the information. That is something that I wasn't aware of it and it's something that we will have a closer look at."
The ABC understands that a team of investigators from ASIC is looking into LM's statements, disclosures and the valuations it has placed on a key asset in one of its funds.
LM Investment denies it has misled investors.
In a written statement, LM Investment told Four Corners: "Material we circulated to a small group of some 40 financial advisors only contained a reference to "bank-like".
"That was in the context of an offer being made to class holders with minimum investments of $500,000 as an alternative to the fund taking a 'bank-like' facility. It was not referred to as an 'investment'.
"The confusion regarding context was identified almost immediately and it was removed from circulation with an amended document forwarded to those who received the first, to eliminate any possibility that reference may be taken out of the context originally intended."
The business's owner and chairperson Peter Drake reportedly told The Courier-Mail last week: "I suppose on a global basis we are a small Macquarie Bank where we sell Australian products to the world."
Portfolio
LM Investment is marketing its managed performance fund as having a diverse portfolio of assets. Yet a mortgage over one site - the 118-hectare Maddison Estate at Pimpama in the Gold Coast hinterland - makes up 62.5 per cent of the assets in the fund.
The land was purchased for $89 million between 2007 and 2009 by interests associated with Peter Drake.
Property values in the area have slumped since and independent valuers have told Four Corners the unimproved land would be worth, at best, at about half the purchase price.
Before any work commenced at the site, the borrowings over the land stood at about $250,000 – with a small first mortgage to the bank Suncorp and a very large second mortgage in the name of companies ultimately controlled by LM Investment.
The main asset in the LM Managed Performance Fund is the second mortgage over the Maddison Estate, established via a complex web of corporate structures, which has been growing as unpaid interest is capitalised into the loan. The mortgage currently stands at more than $240 million.
A network of financial planners overseas are being paid very high commissions to place their clients in LM Investment's Managed Performance Fund; LM says the indicative financial advice fee taken out of the investors' money is 4.4 per cent in the first year, then an ongoing trailing commission of 3.3 per cent a year.
LM Investment is charging a management fee of 5 per cent a year, though this can rise as high as 10 per cent.
Returns
Despite the high fees huge sums of money are flowing into the fund from offshore. It is offering returns of 3 to 5 per cent above the Reserve Bank cash rate, although no land has yet been sold at Maddison and this key asset is at yet delivering no revenue.
"If I was an investor in that fund I would have concerns as to so much of my investment being exposed to one asset when the fund is marketed as a multi asset fund," says Danny Maher of Fiducia Wealth Management.
"I'd also have major concern where my income's being derived when that estate, Maddison Estate, is very much in its infancy."
A former special investigator and senior lawyer at ASIC, Niall Coburn, was contracted to investigate the LM Managed Performance Fund by a rival fund manager that is fighting to take over some LM schemes on behalf of disgruntled investors.
"Based on my professional experience investigating complex financial structures I would say that if you allow more investors to get involved, ultimately they will lose their money."
LM Investment maintains that the Maddison Estate will eventually be worth between $1 billion and $1.6 billion.

Israel's Sinai fence: it works
Israel Hayom, the free periodical with which Sheldon Adelson is distorting the Israeli newspaper business almost as much as they are the functioning of the GOP, crowed yesterday Milestone: No illegal African migrants enter Israel in August September 1, 2013
The month of August marked a milestone in Israel's efforts to stem the tide of illegal African migrants entering the country. For the first time no infiltrations were recorded from the Egyptian border, compared to 193 from the same month last year, according to a press release issued Sunday by the Population and Immigration Authority.
For good measure
In addition, 168 Sudanese and Eritrean migrants left Israel voluntarily according to the guidelines stipulated by Attorney-General Yehuda Weinstein.
As I have previously noted, the Israelis are trying to find an African country to take those Africans whose own homelands are too chaotic. The Israelis are serious about deportation.
Stopping illegal immigration cold like this has been due to Israel's new border fence on the Egyptian frontier. It has proved that there is no technical or practical reason why the same thing would not work on America's Mexican border.
Israel Hayom's handling of this story is in marked contrast with similar news earlier in the year. But subsequently the Owner spoke as I noted in Sheldon Adelson: "Put A Big Fence Around Our Country" (Israel, That Is)
This weekend also came the news As of Friday, Infiltrators Can't Export Money Arutz Sheva 9/2/2013
Interior Minister Gid'on Saar signed regulations, Monday, that make it illegal for someone who illegally infiltrated the country to send money out of the country. The goal of the measures are to make the infiltrators leave with what they accumulated instead of regularly sending it out to their countries of origin.
In June I asked Why Not Include This Sensible New Israeli Measure In Gang Bill?
The answer of course is that Israel's rulers care about their people . America's consist of anti-white Democrats planning a permanent Minority Occupation Government and Slave Power Republicans planning plutocratic gated community retirement.
Sheldon Adelson – who went public last December favoring Amnesty and no deportations for America – is an hypocritical and unspeakably disgusting menace to the Republic.
No politician who accepts money from them can be trusted

Storm Over the Brain from the April 24, 2014 issue
To the Editors:
In Neurophilosophy I made the point that if you want to understand the mind, you need to understand the brain.1 In their review of my recent book Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain, Colin McGinn gibbles up this simple message [NYR, April 24]. Here is the thing: there is a difference between a necessary condition and a sufficient condition. Oxygen is a necessary condition for burning wood; it is not a sufficient condition. Sufficiency requires much else besides, including bringing the wood to a kindling point, and so forth. When I said it is necessary to understand the brain in order to understand the mind, I am talking about a necessary condition. I am not talking about a sufficient condition.
In fact, I have famously argued for the coevolution of sciences at many levels. This explicitly includes the coevolution of the neurosciences and psychological sciences. To my delight but not surprise, the coevolution is now well underway in research on memory, attention, sensory systems, consciousness, and self-control, for example.
Other scientific disciplines are also extremely important in understanding the nature of the mind: genetics, ethology, anthropology, and linguistics. Philosophy can play a role too, when the philosopher sees it is rewarding to get out of the armchair. Some philosophers, such as Chris Eliasmith, for example, have truly made progress in computationally modeling how the brain represents the world.
Nevertheless, there are nostalgic philosophers who whinge on about saving the purity of the discipline from philosophers like me and Chris Eliasmith and Owen Flanagan and Dan Dennett. What do the purists, like McGinn, object to? It is that their lovely a priori discipline, where they just talk to each other and maybe cobble together a thought experiment or two, is being sullied by…data. Their sterile construal of philosophy is not one that would be recognized by the great philosophers in the tradition, such as Aristotle or Hume or Kant.
Nobody in neuroscience needs McGinn to tell us that structural correlates of a function do not ipso facto explain that function. Their sermonizing is just so much spit in the wind. What they fail to get is that sussing out structure is often a major step forward in sorting out mechanism. Famously this was so when Watson and Crick figured out the structure of DNA. Neither they nor anyone else supposed that the mechanism of how proteins got made could therefore just be read off the helical structure. First, a lot more had to be discovered, such as the role of RNA, the existence of both messenger RNA and transfer RNA, the role of ribosomes, and a whole lot else besides. But discovering the helical structure of four base pairs was a huge step. This is likely to be true also in neuroscience.
The view for which McGinn is known is a jejune prediction, namely that science cannot ever solve the problem of how the brain produces consciousness. On what do they base their prediction? Flimsy stuff. First, they are pretty sure our brain is not up to the job. Why not? Try this: a blind man does not experience color, and they will not do so even when we explain the brain mechanisms of experiencing color. Added to which, McGinn says that they cannot begin to imagine what it is like to be a bat, or how conscious experience might be scientifically explained (his brain not being up to the job, as they insist). This cognitive inadequacy they deem to have universal epistemological significance.
Alongside the arrogance, here is one whopping flaw: no causal explanation for a phenomenon, such as color vision, should be expected to actually produce that phenomenon. Here is why: the neural pathways involved in visually experiencing color are not the same pathways as those involved in intellectually understanding the mechanisms for experiencing color. Roughly speaking, experiencing color depends on areas in the back of the brain (visual areas) and intellectual understanding of an explanation depends on areas in the front of the brain.
Likewise, I might be able to understand in great detail the mechanisms underlying pregnancy. But I do not expect such understanding to result in my becoming pregnant. A very different causal pathway is needed to achieve pregnancy. Ditto for the difference between understanding the mechanisms of experience, and having that very experience. This is not a new point.2
Anyhow, understanding a natural phenomenon is not an all-or-nothing affair. Do we understand how genes work? Yes, up to a point, but there are many things that are not yet understood. Gaps in our knowledge of the brain certainly exist, but undeniably, progress has been made. Some philosophers have elevated their favorite gap in neuroscience to the ontological status of an object, like the Black Hole in the Milky Way Galaxy, and hence they refer reverentially to the Explanatory Gap. Bosh. There are knowledge gaps all over the place, and slowly, many are closing as science proceeds.
McGinn closes with some arch tut-tutting about words. The fact is, language changes as culture changes, including as the scientific culture changes. People used to think that atoms are indivisible particles—and indeed “a-tom” originally meant “not splittable.” But atoms can be split and we still call atoms “atoms.” And brains do sleep, remember spatial locations, and learn to navigate their social and physical worlds. Get used to it.
Patricia Churchland
University of California, San Diego
Colin McGinn replies:
It is just possible to discern some points beneath the heated rhetoric in which Patricia Churchland indulges. But none of these points is right. If you hold that “mental processes are actually processes in the brain,” to quote Churchland, then you are committed to the thesis that it is sufficient to understand the mind that one understands the brain, and not merely necessary. This is just the well-known “identity theory” of mind and brain: mental processes are identical to brain processes; and the identity of a with b entails the sufficiency of a for b. To hold the weaker thesis that knowledge of the brain is merely necessary for knowledge of the mind is consistent even with being a heavy-duty Cartesian dualist, since even such a dualist accepts that mind depends causally on brain.
Churchland suggests that I am a philosophical purist who eschews all interdisciplinary cooperation. It is true that I think many philosophical problems cannot in principle be solved by science (a very common opinion), but that does not imply that I avoid interdisciplinary work or disapprove of it. On the contrary, I have done quite a bit of such work myself—connecting philosophy to physics, biology, psychology, film theory, and literary studies—and I admire the work of others in this vein.
The point about the explanatory gap is not that structure alone fails to provide a full explanation of consciousness. It is that even knowledge of brain structures and brain mechanisms is not sufficient for explaining consciousness. I cannot go into this issue here, which has been widely discussed in the literature, but the intuitive point is clear enough: consciousness as it presents itself to introspection appears to be just a different kind of thing from activity in the brain. If this were not so, no one would ever have been a dualist.
Churchland's account of my arguments for our cognitive limitations with respect to explaining consciousness bears little relation to what I have written in several books, as anyone who has dipped into those books will appreciate. What they refer to as a “whopping flaw” in my position (and that of many others) is simply a complete misreading of what has been argued: the point is not that having a causal explanation for a phenomenon should produce that phenomenon, so that a blind man will be made to see by having a good theory of vision. The point is rather that a blind man will not understand what color vision is merely by finding out about the brain mechanisms that underlie it, since they need acquaintance with the color experiences themselves.
I was not “tut-tutting about words”: I was saying that it is factually false to describe groups of neurons as making decisions (the “homunculus fallacy”).
I can see nothing enlightening in this exchange.
In fact, that appears to be what mainly happened to the tax rebates affluent Americans received during the last recession in 2001.
On the other hand, money delivered to people who aren't in good financial shape — who are short on cash and living check to check — does double duty: it alleviates hardship and also pumps up consumer spending.
That's why many of the stimulus proposals we were hearing just a few days ago focused in the first place on expanding programs that specifically help people who have fallen on hard times, especially unemployment insurance and food stamps. And these were the stimulus ideas that received the highest grades in a recent analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

There was also some talk among Democrats about providing temporary aid to state and local governments, whose finances are being pummeled by the weakening economy. Like help for the unemployed, this would have done double duty, averting hardship and heading off spending cuts that could worsen the downturn.
But the Bush administration has apparently succeeded in killing all of these ideas, in favor of a plan that mainly gives money to those least likely to spend it.
Why would the administration want to do this? It has nothing to do with economic efficacy: no economic theory or evidence I know of says that upper-middle-class families are more likely to spend rebate checks than the poor and unemployed. Instead, what seems to be happening is that the Bush administration refuses to sign on to anything that it can't call a “tax cut.”

Behind that refusal, in turn, lies the administration's commitment to slashing tax rates on the affluent while blocking aid for families in trouble — a commitment that requires maintaining the pretense that government spending is always bad. And the result is a plan that not only fails to deliver help where it's most needed, but is likely to fail as an economic measure.
The words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt come to mind: “We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals; we know now that it is bad economics.”

And the worst of it is that the Democrats, who should have been in a strong position — does this administration have any credibility left on economic policy? — appear to have caved in almost completely.
Yes, they extracted some concessions, increasing rebates for people with low income while reducing giveaways to the affluent. But basically they allowed themselves to be bullied into doing things the Bush administration's way.
And that could turn out to be a very bad thing.
We don't know for sure how deep the coming slump will be, or even whether it will meet the technical definition of a recession. But there's a real chance not just that it will be a major downturn, but that the usual response to recession — interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve — won't be sufficient to turn the economy around. (For more on this, see my blog at krugman.blogs.nytimes.com.)
And if that happens, we'll deeply regret the fact that the Bush administration insisted on, and Democrats accepted, a so-called stimulus plan that just won't do the job.
[np_storybar title=”John Kerry heading to the Middle East” link=””]
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is heading to the Middle East this weekend to discuss Iraq's stability as a raging Sunni Muslim insurgency threatens the Shiite-led government.
The U.S. is offering limited assistance to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki but wants them to take dramatic steps to soothe Sunnis who say they have been shut out from their government.
The State Department said Friday Kerry will meet next week with officials in Amman, Jordan, on the border with Iraq. Officials had said that Kerry planned to visit Iraq soon but did not say when.
Kerry will also travel to Paris to meet with officials from Arab Gulf nations to discuss Iraq and Syria. And they will stop in Brussels for a NATO ministerial meeting. Their trip is scheduled from June 22-27.

A powerful truck bomb exploded on Friday in a government-held village in central Syria, killing at least 34 civilians and wounding more than 50, as an Al-Qaeda breakaway group captured a major town to the east, near the Iraqi border, activists said.
Fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham stormed the town of Muhassan on the Euphrates river after rebels from the Western-backed Supreme Military Council defected to the jihadi group, activists said. The village is in the eastern oil-rich province of Deir el-Zour where the Islamic State has been on the offensive since late April against rival jihadi and Islamic groups.
The capture of Muhassan, about 100 kilometres from the Iraqi border, and two nearby villages, comes a week after the group swept across wide areas in northern and central Iraq, capturing that country's second largest city of Mosul, and carving out a large region straddling the border.
“The capture of Muhassan is one of the biggest victories for the Islamic State in Deir el-Zour because it is home of the main centre of the military council in the province,” said Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
An activist based in the province who goes by the name Abu Abdullah said residents told them that Islamic State fighters raise their black flags around the town. They added via Skype that many of the rebels in Muhassan expressed loyalty to the group.
The Islamic State's seven-week offensive in Deir el-Zour against rival groups including the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and the ultraconservative Ahrar Al-Sham has killed more than 640 people and uprooted at least 130,000, according to activists.
Earlier Friday, state news agency SANA said the truck bomb exploded in Horrah village in the countryside near the central city of Hama. It quoted an unnamed official in the Hama police command as saying that the truck was loaded with about three tons of explosives.
The attack “caused the destruction of a large number of houses and buildings in the village,” the report said. It did not immediately provide further information on the attack or say what the target was.
The Islamic Front, an umbrella for several rebel groups in Syria, claimed responsibility for the attack in a video posted online, which showed a night-time explosion that sent a ball of fire into the sky.
The Observatory, which documents the violence in Syria through an extensive network of activists on the ground, said at least 37 people were killed and more than 40 others were wounded in the bombing. In a statement, it said the toll was likely to rise because many of the wounded were in critical condition.
Car bombs are common in Syria's civil war, now in its fourth year. The conflict has killed more than 160,000 people, according to opposition activists. Nearly a third of those killed were civilians.
The Syrian conflict started in March 2011 with Arab Spring-inspired protests against President Bashar Al-Assad's rule but escalated into a civil war after their forces launched a brutal crackdown on dissent.
The war has since taken on strong sectarian overtones, pitting a Sunni-led insurgency that includes Al-Qaeda-inspired extremist groups against a government dominated by Assad's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
Foreign fighters and Islamic extremists have taken on an increasingly prominent role among the rebels, dampening the West's support for the uprising against Assad.
The Syrian conflict has unleashed a humanitarian catastrophe and displaced some nine million people, a third of the pre-war population. More than 2.5 million Syrians have taken refuge in neighboring countries, straining aid resources.
The United Nations refugee agency said Friday that the number of people forced from their homes worldwide has surged past 50 million for the first time since the Second World War. The massive increase was mainly driven by Syria's war.
Microsoft to Issue Emergency Security Update Today
Microsoft said late Wednesday that it plans to break out of its monthly patch cycle to issue a security update today for a critical vulnerability in all supported versions of Windows.
Redmond rarely releases security patches outside of Patch Tuesday, the second Tuesday of each month. The software giant isn't providing many details yet, but the few times it has departed from its Patch Tuesday cycle it has always done so to stop the bleeding on a serious security hole that criminals were using to break into Windows PCs on a large scale.
By Security Fix's count, this would be the fourth time since January 2006 that Microsoft has deviated from its monthly patch cycle to plug security holes. As shown by the stories in the linked examples above, Microsoft has fixed problems, each time, that were being actively exploited by bad guys to break into PCs.
Microsoft's advanced notification bulletin says the problem is critical on Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, meaning this is a vulnerability that can be exploited through little or no help from the user. Redmond's labels the flaw "important" on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 machines.
Microsoft is expected to push out the update around 1:00 p.m. ET. The company also will reveal more details about the patch in a special Webcast. I'll have more information on this update as soon as the patch is out and details are released. Stay tuned.
Update, 12:00 p.m.: Corrected the time Microsoft is expected to release this patch today.
Update, 12:45 p.m. ET: A source of mine received some information from Microsoft saying the vulnerability stems from a critical, wormable problem in the Windows server message block service, a component of Windows used to provide shared access to files, printers, and other communications over a network. My source, who asked not to be identified because Microsoft has not yet publicly discussed the details, said Redmond has acknowledged that criminals have for the past three weeks been using the vulnerability to conduct targeted attacks. The source said that so far, fewer than 100 targeted attacks leveraging this flaw have been spotted by Microsoft's security team, but that Microsoft was rushing out this patch because the number of attacks appears to be increasing of late.
Update, 1:31 p.m.: Microsoft has released the update, MS08-067, which will soon hit Windows update as well. My source told me this was an SMB flaw, but they were only partly right.
The vulnerability lies with the Windows Server service, and more specifically with Microsoft's implementation of "remote procedure call" (RPC), a communications technology deeply embedded in the Windows operating system that allows a program to execute another process on a remote system. RPC vulnerabilities are extremely dangerous, as they can be used by a computer worm to spread malicious software to machines on a network with lightning speed. The infamous "Blaster worm" that attacked Microsoft and infected millions of Windows PCs in Aug. 2003 is probably the most recognizable example of malware exploiting an RPC flaw.
Microsoft does not release these so-called "out-of-band" updates lightly. I would highly recommend applying this patch as soon as possible, either by visiting Windows Update or enabling Automatic Updates. A quick scan with Windows Update on my Vista system offered the patch, which installed without incident (requires a reboot).
[Content Note: Emotional auditing.]As requested by Shaker Doctor_Tinycat.Doctor Tinycat requested a piece on why it's harmful to play Devil's Advocate during social justice discussions, so here we go.Um, playing Devil's Advocate is taking the opposite side of an argument, ostensibly to explore a subject from every different angle. And there are a lot of reasons why this dynamic ends up being harmful during social justice discussions, but I'm gonna address four of them here.The first is that what gets called Devil's Advocacy in social justice discussions tends to be a privileged person, ahh, challenging a marginalized person's perception of their own lived experiences. And that's not actually Devil's Advocacy; that's emotional auditing. Um, because it implicitly suggests that a marginalized person's perception of their own lived experiences may somehow not be valid, um, or may be compromised by virtue of their very marginalization. That someone with privilege is more, um, objective. And that is not accurate. Someone with privilege is merely, um—merely has a different perspective on oppression; they are not more objective about it.Secondly, this practice presumes that there's some aspect of one's marginalization that one hasn't considered—um, and it's typically something that a marginalized person has never had theof never having considered before. It may be a new idea to a privileged person, but imagining that you have some great new insight into someone else's oppression, um, is—or that you can imagine an argument that they've never encountered before, is deeply insulting. And it's hostile to the basic idea of respecting other people's humanity, um, and respecting that they're experts on their own lives.Um, third: Devil's Advocacy seeks to turn the intimate aspects of one's life into an abstract discussion. Um, it's really unfair to ask, for example, a—a woman to leave aside their personal experience in order to discuss feminist issues in an abstract way. You are discussing the stuff of their life, and you need to keep that in mind. Asking them to "not make it personal" in order to indulge, uh, your exploration of circumstances of their life, um, from which you're totally detached, is profoundly unkind. Um, it's to ask them to wrench their womanhood from their personhood—and these are not separate pieces of a female human being.andare the same thing to a woman—this goes for everyone from any marginalized population.And finally: Devil's Advocacy in social justice discussions is frequently defended on the basis that the person doing it just wants to find out, um, or get a better understanding of the marginalized person's life, of the thing that they're challenging. But here's the thing: Um, if you want to better understand someone's life, what you need to do isYou don't need to, ahh, force them to engage in some horrible game of emotional policing.If you want to know something about my life, you need to ask me, and then you need to make it safe for me to answer—to make sure that I know that I'm not going to be audited. If you really wanna understand someone, you don't need to play Devil's Advocate; you just need to listen.There are certainly people who will say they view some intrinsic aspect of themselves as renderable from their personhood, and that is of course their right—each person has the right to define themselves in whatever way they like. But it is best to approach each person as if they do not view themselves in detachable parts, because it is extremely harmful to people who don't to be approached that way.
Early evidence suggests that the Central Bank's new lending restrictions have taken the “froth” out of property prices, an economist with the regulator said on Tuesday, as new figures show a further decline in mortgage lending.
Speaking at a Sunday Business Post property conference in Dublin, Gabriel Fagan, economist with the Central Bank, said that tentative evidence suggests that the new measures, which restrict income multiples and loan to values for borrowers, have had a positive effect of removing “froth” from property prices, particularly in the Dublin residential market”.
“This is confirmed by the slowdown in price dynamics and evidence from the Central Bank survey of the house price expectations of property market professionals,” they said.
However, they added that it is still “far too early to judge the effectiveness of the measures taken last January”, adding that it will be “ mid 2016 at the earliest before we can make an initial assessment of the impact and effectiveness of the measures.”
Mortgage lending
Mr Fagan's comments came on a day when new figures showed that the number of mortgages approved in the three months ending October fell by the most since 2011.
According to figures from the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI), mortgage lending fell by 2 per cent in the year to the three months ending October 2015, the first time that mortgage approvals have fallen on a year-on-year basis since April 2013.
There were 2,531 mortgages approved, of which 2,195 were for house purchase. When looked at by value, the decline is 1.3 per cent on the year, and by 6.7 per cent on a three month moving average basis.
Most significant perhaps, is the figure that shows that the number of mortgage approvals for property purchase fell by 7.5 per cent year-on-year - the largest decline since the series began in 2011.The average mortgage approval value in the three months ending October 2015 was € 181,351, up 0.7 per cent year-on-year.
John Cronin, financials analyst with Investec, says that the data shows that the Central Bank's new lending rules are starting to have a “marked effect” on housing transaction activity, but they caution against over-interpreting the figures. Mortgage lending took off in October 2014 following the publication of the Central Bank's consultation paper on the issue, which may over-state the comparison, while they also note that a number of banks have been adopting a very reluctant approach to mortgage lending since the beginning of Q4 in order to avoid any breach of the Central Bank's rules.
“These data show there are real headwinds heading into 2016 for the Irish banks in terms of achieving mortgage loan growth ambitions,” they said, noting that the full impact of the new lending rules may not become fully apparent until the first quarter of 2016.
Meanwhile Goodbody Stockbrokers has cut its full-year lending forecast for 2015 to €4.5 billion, down from €5 billion, far below a “normal” market level of €8 billion a year.
Central Bank
The figures follow similar indicators from the Central Bank. In its monthly report on lending and deposits published yesterday, it showed that lending to Irish households fell again in October, as deposits rose sharply. During the month, loan repayments exceeded drawdowns by € 253 million, as mortgage lending fell by € 138 million, down by 2.4 per cent on an annual basis.
Half-life might work in virtual reality, or it might not. That's Valve's stance on the matter.
Half-life 3 in VR makes perfect sense and should definitely happen, but Valve says it hasn't made any decisions yet.
“We're not saying, ‘no' but we don't know what the right thing is [yet],” Valve programmer Jeep Barnett told Kotaku when asked about the possibility.
“Our most precious resource is time, and we don't have enough time for people to do everything. Would we like to make all of our franchises in VR? Absolutely. But we don't have enough time or people. So we have to figure out what's the best fit, what plays to the strengths of VR.”
Valve has thrown a few Half-life assets around while experimenting with VR, Barnett admitted, but of course that doesn't mean anything will come of it – just as the VR demo Valve is showing at GDC 2015, which is set in Aperture Science, means Portal 3 is happening.
“So yeah, we'll grab some headcrabs, we'll grab the machine guns from Half-Life, the rocket launcher – all those different fun things – and see how they play in VR,” Barnett said.
“But right now, it's a tool for exploring the different kind of game designs we want to do.
“Is Half-Life a good fit? Is Left 4 Dead a good fit? Is a new franchise a good fit? I don't know yet. We're really trying to cover the broad spectrum of what we could do, and then we'll start focusing on spearheading that.”
Valve unveiled the Vive VR headset this week, as well as its Lighthouse technology, which upgrades VR form a seated to a full-room experience.

Surge in number of doctors and nurses from other EU states leaving renews fears that Brexit could exacerbate staffing crisis
A record number of EU nationals left the NHS last year, renewing fears that Brexit could exacerbate a staffing crisis.
EU nurses no longer want to work in Britain. Brexit is poisoning the NHS | Suzanne Moore Read more
The figures, compiled by NHS Digital, prompted medical leaders to call for more reassurances to European workers about their future in the UK. A total of 17,197 EU staff, including nurses and doctors, left their posts in 2016, compared with 13,321 in 2015 and 11,222 for 11 months in 2014.
Even though EU staff numbers rose across the period analysed, experts fear the number of people leaving is the more significant trend.
As Britain embarks on fraught Brexit negotiations, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) and the British Medical Association (BMA) blamed the increase in departures on the prime minister's lack of assurances about the position of EU nationals resident in the UK. Theresa May has said such a pledge would weaken their ability to negotiate a good deal for Britain as it prepares to leave the trade bloc.
Prof Jane Dacre, the RCP president, said: “These figures confirm our fears that EU doctors are feeling unsettled and, at worst, leaving or planning to leave the UK. We need the government to provide reassurance that we will be able to keep our European colleagues, in the NHS and research, as we will not be able to replace them with homegrown doctors for many years to come.”
The BMA's council chair, Dr Mark Porter, said: “Following the EU referendum, thousands of EEA [European Economic Area] nationals working in the NHS and wider health and social care system have been left feeling uncertain as to whether they and their families will have the right to live and work here.
“Worryingly, one in four EEA doctors working in the UK have told the BMA that they are considering leaving following the referendum, with many feeling substantially less appreciated by the government. These are people who have dedicated years of service to healthcare, staffing our hospitals, GP surgeries and leading medical research.”
Analysis by the Guardian shows 2,348 doctors from the 27 other EU states left NHS England between July and September 2016 compared with 1,281 in the same period in 2015. That is a rise of 83% year on year. The figures mirror concerns raised about the growing numbers of nurses leaving the health service and the falling number EU nationals registering as nurses in England, which dropped by 92% since the Brexit vote last June.
The NHS Digital data also shows an increase in other members of NHS staff leaving the health service. In total, 6,391 EU workers quit in the three months after the EU referendum, compared with 4,125 in the same period in 2015 – a 55% increase. The increase in the number of EU staff employed by NHS England in the same period was 15%.
A number of NHS staff told the Guardian they knew colleagues who were considering leaving. One health worker from London, who asked to be anonymous, said: “I am worried. I work in operating theatres and I walk into some of them and they are all EU staffed.
“Every theatre in London has a European citizen in it. Heaven help us if they leave. A few of my colleagues have already left – the good ones.”
A midwife from Worcester, an EU national, said: “I do know of quite a few of my colleagues who are considering leaving. Also junior doctors who aren't eligible for permanent residency because they don't meet the criteria. It's a total disaster.”
Jonathan Ashworth, the Labour party health spokesperson, said: “Safeguarding the future of these staff should be an absolute priority in the Brexit negotiations. Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt [the health secretary] have been totally negligent in failing to guarantee a future for these staff before article 50 was triggered.”
Concern has also been raised about a slowdown in EU nationals joining the NHS since the referendum. Figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council show a 90% drop in the number of nurses from EU states registering to join in December.
Barry Pactor, the managing director of TTM Healthcare, an international recruitment company, said: “Since Brexit TTM Healthcare has seen a marked difference in UK perception among EU healthcare professionals.
“Overwhelmingly concern centres on a lack of clarity around their status and not knowing whether they should plan a long-term future in the UK. With such concerns it is unavoidable that EU specialists will choose alternative countries to continue their careers.”
Some were more cautious about linking the departures with the Brexit vote. Jackie Smith, registrar and chief executive of the Nursing and Midwifery Council, said: “This is the first sign of a change and it is too early to say definitively that changes in this area are due to any one reason.”‎
The Department of Health sought to downplay fears of a staffing crisis. “As the secretary of state has repeatedly made clear, overseas workers form a crucial part of our NHS and we value their contribution immensely,” a spokesperson said.
“We are continuing to invest in the frontline: there are over 34,800 more professionally qualified clinical staff, including over 11,600 more doctors and over 13,400 more nurses on our wards since May 2010. Furthermore, there are 30,000 students training to be doctors and over 52,000 training to be nurses.”
Clovis, who possesses a bachelor's degree in political science, an MBA degree and a doctorate in public administration, repeatedly acknowledged their lack of background in the hard sciences when responding to Stabenow.
“Please list all graduate level courses you have taken in natural science,” the second of 10 questions requested.
“None,” Clovis replied.
“Please list all membership and leadership roles you have held within any agricultural scientific, agricultural education, or agricultural economic organizations,” the third question read.
“None,” Clovis replied.
“Please describe any awards, designations, or academic recognition you have received specifically related to agricultural science,” the fourth question read.
“None,” Clovis replied.
Then came the fifth question, which asked, “What specialized training or significant experience, including certifications, do you have in agricultural research?”
They answered: “I bring 17 years of agriculture experience integrated into both undergraduate- and graduate-level courses throughout my teaching career as reflected in my curriculum vitae as well as the Committee's questionnaire.” And having twice run for statewide office, they added that “one cannot be a credible candidate in that state without significant agricultural experience and knowledge.”
After more than 10 years of turbulent development, the film adaptation of Stephen King's The Dark Tower finally made its way to the big screen this weekend, earning a modest $19.5 million at the box office.
The project, directed by Danish helmer Nikolaj Arcel (A Royal Affair), is based on King's eight-book fantasy series about the world's last gunslinger (Idris Elba) who is determined to hunt down the Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) in order to protect the Dark Tower. It moved from director to director over the years (J.J. Abrams and Ron Howard were both attached to direct at different points), and studio to studio (it was previously at Universal before landing at Sony, with backing from Media Rights Capital). By all accounts, it was a challenging story to crack because it's based on King's massive and complicated world that they created over eight books.
"It's just an introduction to the world; it's not the whole world or all the books," Sony Motion Picture Group chairperson Tom Rothman told THR at the film's premiere. "The credit goes to MRC, [screenwriter] Akiva [Goldsman] and Nikolaj Arcel — I think they were the ones that cracked it creatively and realized that the way to do it is not to try to eat the entire feast all at once, but to maybe just start with the first course."
Before the first course was served, however, the filmmakers were already busy preparing the second — which would be served on a smaller screen. The film installment (with a budget of $60 million) is just the first step in what the producers hope can be a massive, cross-platform cinematic and TV universe.
The idea of a cross-platform universe was first hatched more than a decade ago when Howard came on to direct the film with Goldsman attached to write.
"It was Ron Howard's idea, and at the time it was pretty revolutionary," says Goldsman, who had been talking to Howard about the project as far back as 2001, when the two were working together on A Beautiful Mind(which Goldsman wrote and Howard directed). "What Ron came up with was this idea that the stories had different sizes, which is part of what's interested in Dark Tower — it can be really epic but the stories can also be very small and personal. They said, 'What if we told the stories on platforms that were commensurate with the narrative?'"
At the time, there was no other property attempting to cross between film and TV. Today, Marvel is the closest comparison with its Avengers universe that includes light crossovers between its superhero films and ABC drama Agents of SHIELD.
Goldsman and Howard (who will both exec produce the TV series) had imagined that the TV show would shoot nearly back to back with the film, in hopes of keeping the momentum going, but while the timeline has shifted, sources say the TV show will move forward regardless of whether the film is deemed a financial success or not.
The TV show will be an origin story of sorts, focused on gunslinger Roland's (Elba) younger years, and introduce a new actor to play the character. Elba is signed on to appear in the series, but in a limited capacity, just book-ending the show to introduce the new story. Dennis Haysbert (who plays Roland's father in the film) and Tom Taylor (who in the film plays Jake Chambers, a young man with certain abilities that allow them to help the gunslinger) will also appear in the potential series, which will be based on Wizard and Glass, the fourth book in The Dark Tower series. But while there is casting overlap, the plan is for the TV series to stand on its own and build its own universe — including potential spinoffs. (Sources note that it could parallel Warner Bros.' DC film and TV universes, where The Flash, for example, exists on both the big and small screen in completely separate stories.)
"The plan is definitely to have the TV show dive into [Roland's] past and see what happened there, and that informs the stories in the films," says Arcel, who has been involved with how the franchise would move forward on TV, but is not officially attached to the small-screen effort. "And the sequel to me would be very much almost like [the second book in the Dark Tower series] The Drawing of the Three. Most of that would be finding what the quest exactly is for the remainder of the saga ... So part of that, and even part of the [third book] Wastelands maybe."
When it comes to the film sequel, however, Goldsman says there are ideas, but no script yet. The ending of the first film sets it up for a sequel easily, but the filmmakers, as is customary, aren't open to discussing it before seeing how the first film performs. Insiders stress MRC is taking a wait-and-see approach to a sequel, with a decision likely to come a few weeks after the film has been released and international returns can be reviewed. If the numbers warrant it, a sequel could potentially have a larger budget to match the more ambitious elements of King's novels that were not reflected in the first movie.
Still, according to Goldsman, the hardest part is behind them now. "I think the first movie is the biggest challenge because it's the introduction to a world that is fantastical but not entirely fantasy," they say. "There's a mixing of genre, there's sci-fi and frontier and magic. If the first movie lands, everything gets easier."

My Story About How I Discovered Polymer Clay Miniatures
I've really loved faked food ever since I was a kid. I was that kid that was obsessed with the fake food in the little tikes kitchens haha I also thought that those fake squishy grapes decorating the furniture stores were the best thing ever! I've always loved play dough and anything squishy; I've also always loved miniatures :)
One day back in 2012 I was online and found a cake charm. I had never seen anything like it before and I couldn't figure out whether it was real or not. I ended up contacting the person who was selling it and they told me it was made out of polymer clay. I was so fascinated with it and wanted it so bad but I was only 17 at the time and didn't have a credit card.
I didn't think I could ever make anything like it but the polymer clay idea led me to make little polymer clay penguins. I made my first penguin in October of 2012 and now my best friend has it :) Making penguins helped me to get familiar with the different brands of clays and to find out which ones were my favorites.
Being an avid YouTube user I ended up stumbling upon polymer clay food tutorials and made my first clay piece using modeling clay I had since I was 8 years old. I wasn't even sure if it was modeling clay but I found out when it melted in the oven when I tried to bake it lol. Nonetheless I loved making it, it was a cake, and I wanted to make more and different kinds of clay food. I ended up saving my money and buying a couple supplies every couple of weeks at the craft stores when they were having a good sale or I'd use their coupons (craft stores always have coupons).
I'm still building my collection of clay supplies and I'm still learning new techniques. I don't rely on tutorials like I used to before I started selling my pieces but I still borrow a few techniques I learn. I like looking at a picture of a dessert or confection and trying to make it out of clay. I actually use cook books as my references a lot of the times.
I've had and still have very many hobbies but this is the only hobby that I felt like I could make into a business for myself. I really love all kinds of art but I enjoy multimedia, painting, and clay the most. I am so passionate about it and It really brings me so much joy to sit down and create my pieces. It's been 2 years now since I made that first clay cake and I have no intentions of stopping in the future :)
Just a little bit more about me <3
I'm also an aspiring makeup artist and I love all things beauty :)
The Chief of General Staff of South Sudan's military, General James Hoth Mai, has pledged that within a few months the country will acquire anti-aircraft missiles to defend its territory from attacks by neighboring Sudan, the Sudanese Tribune daily reported.
The Chief of General Staff of South Sudan's military, General James Hoth Mai, has pledged that within a few months the country will acquire anti-aircraft missiles to defend its territory from attacks by neighboring Sudan, the Sudanese Tribune daily reported.
When the South Sudanese military receives the missiles, it will "not have an issue with air defense," Gen. Hoth Mai said at a meeting of high-ranking military officers on Tuesday.
South Sudan became the world's newest independent nation in July last year. However, the country's independence, which followed decades of civil war, has failed to resolve all issues with its northern neighbor Sudan and fighting still rages in disputed territories along the border. The newly independent state currently has no anti-aircraft batteries or warplanes to defend itself from Sudanese air attacks.
This April, South Sudan forces entered the oil-producing border region of Heglig, which a 2009 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague included in Sudan's Southern Kordofan state. Heglig accounts for 60,000 out of 115,000 barrels of oil produced in Sudan daily.
During the recent battles in Heglig, the Sudanese air force carried out regular air attacks on the positions of the South Sudanese army on the border areas but also deep inside the South Sudan territory, the Sudan Tribune said.
The UN's top human rights official last Friday said they were outraged by Sudan's "indiscriminate" aerial bombing of South Sudan and warned that attacks that harm civilians could be considered international crimes.
Google and Fiat Chrysler are on the verge of signing their rumored partnership on self-driving technology, which should begin with several dozen Pacifica minivans being equipped as prototypes, a report said on Tuesday.
A deal could be signed as soon as today , sources informed Bloomberg. The vans should be deployed starting later this year as part of the first phase of the companies' broader project Notably, both companies will allegedly be free to cooperate with other firms on self-driving systems. For Fiat Chrysler, though, the deal may be an essential step in kickstarting its self-driving efforts.In April, Fiat Chrysler chairperson John Elkann suggested that their company should cooperate with businesses like Apple and Google, rather than try to compete. Google has reportedly been in talks with several automakers, though a deal with GM is said to have collapsed due to disputes over data and technology ownership.It's unclear whether Google will ever sell a branded car, instead of just sharing its self-driving platform with others. Even if it did design its own vehicle, it would have to partner with other companies on manufacturing.Apple is believed to be developing self-driving technology, but most likely for use in its own electric car . That product could roll out as soon as 2019 or 2020, but might initially lack self-driving options, and would still have to be manufactured by a third party short of massive investments in infrastructure and letting the secret out early.
2017 F1: Ferrari 'media blackout' returns in Bahrain
Posted by: Admin on Apr 14, 2017 - 03:56 AM 2017 F1: Ferrari 'media blackout' returns in Bahrain
Ferrari's 'media blackout' is back in Bahrain. Over the winter, and then at the season opener in Australia, it was obvious that Ferrari was taking an extraordinarily low profile when it came to speaking to the media.
Team boss Maurizio Arrivabene defended the approach. "The thing is to find the balance," they said, explaining that Ferrari is trying to mix traditional communication methods with digital and social media this year. Ferrari was then more open in China, but on Thursday in Bahrain it was clear the 'media blackout' was back as Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen did no appearances for the general press. Germany's Sport1 quoted a team spokesperson as saying joint championship leader Vettel was busy with sponsor events, and it would have been "unfair" to give the entire load to teammate Raikkonen.

In 1962, a nuclear confrontation seemed imminent. The United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) were embroiled in the Cuban missile crisis. Both were in the process of building hair-trigger nuclear ballistic missile systems. Each country pondered post-nuclear attack scenarios.
U.S. authorities considered ways to communicate in the aftermath of a nuclear attack. How could any sort of “command and control network” survive? Paul Baran, a researcher at RAND, offered a solution: design a more robust communications network using “redundancy” and “digital” technology.
At the time, naysayers dismissed Baran's idea as unfeasible. But working with colleagues at RAND, Baran persisted. This effort would eventually become the foundation for the World Wide Web.
Baran was born in Poland in 1926. In 1928, their family moved to the United States. They attended Drexel University, where they earned a degree in electrical engineering. Afterward, Baran moved to Los Angeles, where they worked for the Hughes Aircraft Company. Taking night classes at UCLA, they earned an engineering master's degree in 1959—the same year they joined RAND.
At that time, RAND focused mostly on Cold War-related military issues. A looming concern was that neither the long-distance telephone plant, nor the basic military command and control network would survive a nuclear attack. Although most of the links would be undamaged, the centralized switching facilities would be destroyed by enemy weapons. Consequently, Baran conceived a system that had no centralized switches and could operate even if many of its links and switching nodes had been destroyed.
Baran envisioned a network of unmanned nodes that would act as switches, routing information from one node to another to their final destinations. The nodes would use a scheme they called “hot-potato routing” or distributed communications.
When rescuers arrived at the Fiorini home, they found a confusing scene. Two children were outside the burning house, while just inside the door was an unconscious woman and another child. It was obvious that the children had barely escaped a devastating fire.
As WLTX News reports, at about 2 a.m. on October 29th, Angel Fiorini woke up coughing and realized their house was on fire. As flames and smoke filled their small home, the Newman Lake, Washington, mom of three tried to save them children.
Angel grabbed 18-month-old Rosalie and 3-year-old Vinny and took them outside. But that wasn't enough to keep them from harm. The two small children were worried about their mom, and Angel needed to ensure they wouldn't get back into the house.
So they closed the front door, shutting themselves in with the flames. With the door closed, smoke filled the house. Meanwhile, Angel looked for their 7-year-old daughter, Gianna. Angel's friend, Carla Klauder, told KREM News:
“She had to shut the door and they couldn't find the door when they came back out so they laid on top of Gianna.”
Angel succumbed to the smoke and was badly burned by the fire. They and Gianna were still there when a passerby saw the smoke and dragged the unconscious mom and girl out of the doorway.
Family members: "God was with them that night." They say Angel would do anything for their kids pic.twitter.com/tnRBHwF6r6 — Ryan Simms (@RyanTVNews) October 31, 2016
Emergency crews soon arrived and put out the fire. The two youngest children had minimal injuries and were discharged from the hospital after a short stay. Gianna, who was shielded from the flames by their mother's body, had second-degree burns on approximately 14% of their body. They were taken to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle and released in mid-November.
Angel, however, spent weeks in critical care recovering from their injuries. The 29-year-old mom suffered second- and third-degree burns over nearly half of their body and required extensive skin grafts.
According to KREM News, Angel's only request as they were taken to the hospital was that someone call their husband and let them know what happened. The brave mom's sacrifice didn't surprise friends and family, who say Angel would do anything for their children. One family member told KREM‘s Ryan's Simms:
“God was with them that night.”
After five weeks in the hospital, Angel is finally back home with their children again, but there are still challenges ahead. The family lost everything in the fire and must now start over. Fortunately, the community is coming to their aid.
Other then their injuries, one of the hardest things for Angel was not seeing their kids for more than a month pic.twitter.com/yAF6BKki7e — Ryan Simms (@RyanTVNews) December 5, 2016
Friends have set up donation pages on Facebook and GoFundMe. Local stores and businesses have held fundraisers for the Fiorinis as well. The Greenacres Vendor Mall has even set up a “tree of sharing” to benefit the Fiorini family. In addition to getting necessities, they want to make sure the children have a merry Christmas.
Angel told friends that other than their injuries, one of the worst parts was being away from their children. As far as this “supermom” is concerned, having their family is together again is the best gift of all.

A ten-year-old immigrant girl with cerebral palsy treated for gallbladder surgery at a hospital in Texas may be deported to Mexico after they recover, the Corpus Christi Caller-Times reported.
10 year old Maria Rosa is at a hospital & @CustomsBorder is right outside their room waiting to deport their Sign&Share https://t.co/IYVjAkF37w pic.twitter.com/bIkRJzYwSa — DreamActivist (@DreamAct) October 25, 2017
Rosa Maria Hernandez — an undocumented child from Laredo living in the United States since they were three months old — was transported by ambulance to Driscoll Children's Hospital to receive gallbladder surgery on Tuesday.

Them U.S. citizen cousin, Aurora Cantu accompanied them on the ambulance ride, but border agents stopped the vehicle along an interior immigration checkpoint near Freer on US-59 as it headed to Corpus Christi. Border agents allowed the ambulance to continue but also followed them roughly 150 miles to the hospital, the San Antonio Express-News reported.
“Due to the juvenile's medical condition, Border Patrol agents escorted them and their cousin to a Corpus Christi hospital where they could receive appropriate medical care,” according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency statement made available to the Express-News. “Per the immigration laws of the United States, once medically cleared they will be processed accordingly.”
“They told me that my aunt [Rosa Maria's mother] had two options,” Cantu told the publication. “The first option was we could take them back to Mexico and arrange for a family member to get them If my aunt didn't want to do that, the second option was that they could spend several weeks in a detention center.”
Rosa Maria underwent surgery on Tuesday and was medically cleared as of Wednesday morning. Felipa de la Cruz, their 39-year-old undocumented mother who's based in Laredo, said Rosa Maria would not be able to receive the same medical care if they are deported. De la Cruz told the Caller-Times that federal agents were stationed outside their daughter's hospital room.
CBP spokesperson Rod Kise confirmed to the Caller-Times that Border Patrol agents “escorted” Rosa Maria to the hospital where they received “appropriate medical care.”

“Per the immigration laws of the United States, once medically cleared they will be processed accordingly,” Kise added. “The Mexican Consulate has been advised of the situation by Laredo Sector Border Patrol.”
If the government detains Rosa Maria, there's a chance they won't be held for more than than 21 days, the maximum number of days that some immigrant children can be held at family detention centers before being released to U.S. sponsors. Because their mother is undocumented, it may be difficult for Rosa Maria to find a sponsor. Former-Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly previously ordered federal agents to consider deporting undocumented family members who come forward to claim their children in government custody, as the Express News pointed out.
With the exception of extraordinary circumstances, the Department of Homeland Security — the parent organization that oversees operations at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency — has long asked its agents to adopt a “sensitive locations” policy which discourages arrests at “sensitive” places like hospitals, churches, and schools. This is meant to prevent disruptions to the daily routines at these locations.
But border agents are increasing stepping up their enforcement in these places. One woman with a brain tumor, who hemorrhaged and collapsed inside an immigration detention center, was treated at a Fort Worth-area hospital. After their surgery, they were placed back in a detention center. They have since been released on bail.
Federal immigration agents have also stopped other undocumented families from getting to Driscoll Children's Hospital. In May, Oscar and Irma Sanchez encountered border agents when they passed an interior checkpoint to get their sick son to Driscoll. Border agents accompanied them to the hospital. The following morning, both parents were taken to a Border Patrol station to be fingerprinted and booked. And in June, the government barred Wendy Armendariz, an undocumented mother living in Texas, from accompanying their U.S.-citizen son born with a severe case of Spina Bifida to travel to Driscoll from Brownsville.
UPDATE: On Wednesday, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency transferred Rosa Maria to a San Antonio children's shelter that contracts with the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.

Them lawyer, Leticia Gonzalez, told the San Antonio Express-News that the child still needs follow-up medical care and will not be released to their family.
“They're refusing to allow this cerebral palsy child to be released to their family,” Gonzalez said. “They are insisting on taking them into the children's home, which is a quasi detention center.”
CORRECTION: Rosa Maria's name was previously spelled Rosamaria. The piece has been changed to reflect that update.
MANILA, Philippines – Senate Majority Floor Leader Vicente Sotto III in a privilege speech Tuesday maintained that they will not apologize for their alleged plagiarism, stressing they never stole the ideas of others in their speeches on the Reproductive Health (RH) bill.
“[Plagiarism is] to steal or pass off the ideas of another as one's own without crediting the source,” Sotto said.

“I did not pass off anything as my own. How will I apologize for plagiarism when I never plagiarised? They want me to plead guilty for murder when the case is physical injury,” they said.
Sotto's impromptu privilege speech came after a group composed of academicians filed early Tuesday a complaint against Sotto before the Senate Ethics Committee.
They had allegedly copied parts of a blog post by the United States blogger Sarah Pope in their speech during plenary debates on the RH Bill.
Sotto was also accused of copying from a speech of the late US Senator Robert Kennedy which they translated into Tagalog. Senator Kennedy's daughter had been demanding for a public apology from Sotto for the incident.
“The Senate journal will bear me out, I never said they are mine, I never said I own them,” Sotto said.
They said that the Kennedy has been misinformed to get them to say something against him. “What they were told was that I mangled the line of their speech,” Sotto said.
They obtained that quote from Senator Kennedy through a text message of a Christian leader. They said they did not even know it was from Kennedy at that time.
“I did not steal it or passed it off as mine. The worst that can be said is that I copied it from a text of a friend, if they think it was copied, that's possible, because I did copy it,” Sotto said.
They also justified it saying that “copying or imitation is the highest form of flattery.”
ADVERTISEMENT
“If it insulted the Kennedy family then I'm sorry, but that was not the intention,” they said.
Sotto said they believe RH bill advocates were behind the complaint and misinformation against him. They pointed out that the media advisory about the filing of the complaint before the Senate Ethics Committee Tuesday morning came from the office of Akbayan Partylist Representative Walden Bello.
They further warned that “when I have gathered enough evidence, I will expose those behind this manipulation.”
“You can call me names, but I will not change my position and I will always be against the distribution of contraceptives,” Sotto said.
Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile again defended Sotto and said “let them file the case and give them a chance to prove their case.”
Sotto added “it will also give me a chance to prove they are wrong.”

Among the biggest losers on Tuesday was conservative strategist Karl Rove, and not just because their side lost. The Fox News analyst, who questioned their network's decision to call the election for President Obama on air after earlier incorrectly predicting a Romney victory, also has to reckon with the reality that their big-spending super PAC, American Crossroads, got almost no return on the more than $100 million it spent to influence the election.
A study by the Sunlight Foundation found that just 1.29 percent of the nearly $104 million it spent in the general election ended with the desired result. In addition to spending $85 million to defeat Mr. Obama and $6.5 million to support Mitt Romney, the group spent millions more opposing Democratic Senate candidates Bill Nelson in Florida, Jon Tester in Montana, Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, and Tim Kaine in Virginia - all of whom won. The only candidates it supported who won were Republicans Deb Fisher in Nebraska and Dean Heller in Nevada, who the group spent a combined $1.3 million to support.
The return for American Crossroads' sister group, Crossroads GPS, was not much better. Crossroads GPS, which keeps its donors secret, saw a 14 percent return on the $70 million it spent. Another conservative outside group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, saw just a 6.9 percent return on its $33 million in spending. The National Rifle Association's return on its nearly $12 million in spending: 0.81 percent.
The poor performance by Rove's groups had Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York mocking the longtime Republican strategist, who was hailed as "Bush's Brain" for helping engineer George W. Bush's 2000 and 2004 victories. "If Crossroads was the business and Karl Rove was the CEO, he'd be fired for getting a poor return for their investors," Schumer told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast Thursday morning, according to Politico. They went on to speculate that Crossroads won't be "as much of a player two years from now" as a result.
Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod added on a conference call with reporters Thursday afternoon that the billionaires who donated to outside groups should be asking for a refund. They added that it was "heartening" that the presidency can't be bought.
Rove wasn't the only conservative who has to come to terms with the fact that the massive election spending on the right accounted for little more than a mini-stimulus package. Texas industrialist Harold Simmons, the New York Times reports, spent nearly $27 million backing Romney and GOP Senate candidates; Chicago Cubs owner Joe Ricketts spent $13 million on a super PAC attacking Mr. Obama; Texas homebuilder Bob Perry spent $21 million to defeat the president and Democratic Senate candidates in Florida and Virginia who ultimately triumphed. Mega-donor Sheldon Adelson spent more than $60 million to boost GOP candidates, though that's relative pocket change for the casino magnate worth more than $20 billion.
"[Republican outside groups] were so reliant on a very small number of people who funded this," said Bob Biersack, senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics. "So those people have to feel a little bit embarrassed. And it's not a common experience for them. They'll have to evaluate how they spent the money and what might be a better use of that kind of resource." For Rove and others seeking donations, they said, "it'll be a harder sell" in the future.
The record-breaking $6 billion spent in the 2012 election cycle, which included an estimated $1.3 billion in spending by outside groups, resulted (in part) in a deluge of mostly-negative advertising in the battleground states. (Roughly two-thirds of the outside group spending was to boost Republicans.) Many voters say they tuned those ads out - and there is evidence that negative advertising is relatively ineffective. h
But such ads did appear to make a difference for Romney in the Republican primary, when their deep-pocketed supporters spent heavily to fend off challenges from Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. (Gingrich and Santorum, in turn, depended on wealthy benefactors to help them fight back.) And negative ads from the Obama camp early in the general election campaign helped create a negative perception of Romney that endured to the general election.
Much of the outside group spending, which spiked in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, helped candidates offset the money raised on the other side. A candidate who ended up losing a race narrowly might have been crushed without super PAC support. And some candidates who won would likely not have done so without the millions of dollars spent on their behalf.
"It matters in a lot of different ways, and always they're more nuanced than 'can I just buy the election,'" said Biersack. "That's never been true. As a candidate you have to be visible to the electorate. Your message has to be clear, they have to feel like they know who you are. So it's a threshold question."
But that doesn't mitigate the frustration of donors who spent big on a candidate who fell short. In Illinois, for example, outside groups spent nearly $6 million to help re-elect Tea Party favorite Joe Walsh to the House, according to the Campaign Finance Institute - and they still lost.
Big donors and outside groups will spend the days and weeks following the 2012 contest assessing how they can be more effective in future elections. Some donors may shift resources to super PACs that had a better return on investment - the conservative Club For Growth, for example, saw a relatively robust return of 41.37 percent on its $16.5 million in spending. Some outside groups, meanwhile, may shift their focus to improving the GOP get-out-the-vote effort, since many believe Democrats' superior ground game played a big role in the president's reelection. Foster Friess, who spent millions to boost Republicans in this election cycle, told the Los Angeles Times that's where they believe the emphasis should be. They also predicted that a frustrating election won't prompt big conservative donors to close their wallets.
"My guess is that four years from now, the financial support will not drop off but may be even higher for the outside groups," said Friess.

Representative John Lewis of Georgia was brutally beaten while marching for the right to vote during “Bloody Sunday” in Selma, Alabama, in 1965. The brave activism of Lewis and so many others in the segregated South led to the passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. At the Democratic convention tonight, Lewis told their own story and strongly rebuked efforts by Republican legislators to restrict the right to vote since the 2010 election. Here are their remarks. They are worth quoting in full: Ad Policy
I first came to this city in 1961, the year Barack Obama was born. I was one of the thirteen original “Freedom Riders.” We were on a bus ride from Washington to New Orleans trying to test a recent Supreme Court ruling that banned racial discrimination on buses crossing state lines and in the stations that served them. Here in Charlotte, a young African-American rider got off the bus and tried to get a shoeshine in a so-called white waiting room. They were arrested and taken to jail.
On that same day, we continued on to Rock Hill, South Carolina, about 25 miles. From here, when my seatmate, Albert Bigelow, and I tried to enter a white waiting room, we were met by an angry mob that beat us and left us lying in a pool of blood. Some police officers came up and asked us whether we wanted to press charges. We said, “No, we come in peace, love and nonviolence.” We said our struggle was not against individuals, but against unjust laws and customs. Our goal was true freedom for every American.
Since then, America has made a lot of progress. We are a different society than we were in 1961. And in 2008, we showed the world the true promise of America when we elected President Barack Obama. A few years ago, a man from Rock Hill, inspired by President Obama's election, decided to come forward. They came to my office in Washington and said, “I am one of the people who beat you. I want to apologize. Will you forgive me?” I said, “I accept your apology.” They started crying. They gave me a hug. I hugged them back, and we both started crying. This man and I don't want to go back; we don't want to go back.
Brothers and sisters, do you want to go back? Or do you want to keep America moving forward? My dear friends, your vote is precious, almost sacred. It is the most powerful, nonviolent tool we have to create a more perfect union. Not too long ago, people stood in unmovable lines. They had to pass a so-called literacy test, pay a poll tax. On one occasion, a man was asked to count the number of bubbles in a bar of soap. On another occasion, one was asked to count the jelly beans in a jar—all to keep them from casting their ballots.
Today it is unbelievable that there are Republican officials still trying to stop some people from voting. They are changing the rules, cutting polling hours and imposing requirements intended to suppress the vote. The Republican leader in the Pennsylvania House even bragged that their state's new voter ID law is “gonna allow Governor Romney to win the state.” That's not right. That's not fair. And that is not just.
And similar efforts have been made in Texas, Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia and South Carolina. I've seen this before. I've lived this before. Too many people struggled, suffered and died to make it possible for every American to exercise their right to vote.
And we have come too far together to ever turn back. So Democrats, we must not be silent. We must stand up, speak up and speak out. We must march to the polls like never, ever before. We must come together and exercise our sacred right. And together, on November 6, we will re-elect the man who will lead America forward: President Barack Obama.
On Nov. 1, 2017, the President signed a joint resolution passed by Congress disapproving the Arbitration Agreements Rule under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). Pursuant to the joint resolution, the Arbitration Agreements Rule has no force or effect. On Nov. 22, 2017, the Bureau published a notice removing the Arbitration Agreements Rule from the Code of Federal Regulations. The materials relating to the Arbitration Agreements Rule on the Bureau's website are for reference only.
Tens of millions of consumers use financial products or services like credit cards and student loans that include pre-dispute arbitration clauses in their agreements. This means that either party to these contracts can require disputes be resolved through arbitration, rather than through the court system.
These clauses are controversial. Critics of these clauses argue that they limit consumers' ability to take their dispute to court – particularly class actions, which allow large numbers of people to seek relief together. Advocates of these clauses, on the other hand, say arbitration is quicker and more cost-effective than court proceedings.
What we covered
Since 2012, we've being working on a study of arbitration provisions and report to Congress, which was required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010(Dodd-Frank Act). We've examined pre-dispute arbitration clauses in a number of different product markets:
Credit cards
Checking accounts
Payday and other small dollar loans
General purpose reloadable prepaid cards
Private student loans
Auto purchase loans and
Mobile wireless agreements
After considering dozens of comment letters and meetings with external stakeholders, we looked at nearly 850 consumer-finance agreements to examine the prevalence of arbitration clauses and their terms. We also reviewed more than 1,800 consumer finance arbitration disputes filed over a period of three years and more than 3,400 individual federal court lawsuits. We also looked at 42,000 credit card cases filed in selected small claims court in 2012.
We supplemented this research by assembling and analyzing a set of roughly 420 consumer financial class action settlements in federal courts over a period of five years and over 1,100 state and federal public enforcement actions in the consumer finance area. We also conducted a national survey of 1,000 consumers with credit cards concerning their knowledge and understanding of arbitration and other dispute resolution mechanisms.
We believe this is the most thorough empirical research on this subject, to date.
What we found
Through this research, we've learned that:
Arbitration agreements affect a large number of consumers – for instance, as much as half of all credit card debt and checking account deposits are subject to arbitration agreements.
Three out of four consumers surveyed did not know if they were subject to an arbitration clause.
Consumers are very reluctant to bring claims against companies on their own, particularly small claims.
Roughly 32 million consumers on average are eligible for relief through consumer financial class action settlements each year.
We found no evidence that arbitration clauses lead to lower prices for consumers.
Why it matters
Now that the report is complete, we're going to spend time reviewing the results in order to determine next steps. The Dodd-Frank Act gives us the ability to issue regulations on the use of arbitration clauses in consumer finance markets if we find that doing so is in the public interest and for the protection of consumers.

Enjoy a good card battling game? We do, and mobile gamers got a doozy last week with Animation Throwdown The Quest for Cards. As the moniker implies, it's a game from the folks at Fox, but it's one that involves some of the most popular characters in animated history.
If you are of a certain age, you can probably remember when The Simpsons was the only thing around of its ilk. The long-running toon is not a part of Animation Throwdown The Quest for Cards, but it's safe to say they helped usher in all the shows featured in the game. That currently includes Futurama, Family Guy, American Dad, King of the Hill, and Bob's Burgers.
Like Adventure Time Card Wars and dozens of CCG's before it, Animation Throwdown The Quest for Cards pits you against others in card-based battles. In this case, it's characters from the asupervisorstioned shows, and the cast is vast. Initially, you choose your main leader, but can unlock new ones as you level up through battles. Unfortunately, the cards are mixed together and not tied to your character which does add to the mash-up theme but takes a little away as well.
The Animation Throwdown The Quest for Cards gameplay is easy to pick up on, but surprisingly tricky once you learn combos. In a nutshell, it plays like most CCG's in a turn-based fashion and you can pair player cards with skill cards to form combos… once you've learned them. Once you get past their initial layer of Defense, your hits take a chunk from their leader's health and whoever goes to zero first is deemed a loser. That's the simple version, but there's a nice tutorial to walk you through the finer details as you can see from the screenshot below.
Once you have mastered the basics of battle, getting around in Animation Throwdown The Quest for Cards is fairly simple. The main map is laid out with the Arena, Shop, Deck, Adventure, and Research. The sidebars aren't too busy and hold your Quests and Guilds along with buttons for perks, alerts, and settings. As for the guilds, there's not a lot going on at the moment, but you do get additional perks for joining and being active.
Battles take place in the Arena or Adventure Mode, and each is unique for several reasons. PVP helps you unlock new characters to use in the game along with giving you a chance to win deck cards and coins. There's an energy bar for each mode, which can slow things down, but it's not too horrid of a setup.
Adventure Mode breaks things down into chapters consisting of three battles each. Each battle is a boss character, and the more you beat them the higher your chance pool is for better rewards. Yeah, it's a little grindy, but worth it for the rewards and Animation Throwdown cards of which there are many.
The Deck section is simple to use and where you'll piece together your deck of destruction. Adjusting your deck is a breeze, and there is an Auto-Deck feature to go along with a Recycle Bin for unwanted cards. The shop is where you buy new packs with coins or gems. While the “Basic” packs are fairly priced with coins, the better packs are going to cost you a small fortune in gems.
A Rare pack with two cards (1 rare) is 350 gems which equates to around $4.99 as the cheapest pack is 400 gems. That said, if you're a big spender or have a serious IAP addiction, you can plunk down $100 bones for 10,000 gems. There are also special packs, and we would have snapped up the pack with “Master Robaire” if it wasn't $9.99 although it's actually a deal if for Bobby fans as it also comes with 800 gems.
Last but not least is the Research Tab. This is where you learn combos, which consists of placing cards into Fry's chamber and waiting for hours. Yup, this is where those gems can come in handy as the better the combo, the longer the wait. The results can be quite astonishing and powerful, and we've laughed more at the results than anything else in the actual game — random character quotes and animations aside. Therein lies the rub my friends…
As slick and polished as Animation Throwdown TQFC is, it suffers from a major drawback. The music, animations, and punchlines are great, but there is no voice talent involved. Not one line from Hank or Bobby, no quips from Bertram, and Glurmo was all smiles but no talk. It's a little disarming initially, but we're guessing there are several financial reasons they are absent.
Verdict
While Animation Throwdown The Quest for Cards is missing a few notable shows, it's a massive undertaking to put all these toons together. There's a little something for (almost) everyone, and while the lack of voice talent is a huge drag, it's still a great game to kill some time with.
There's a lot to do for collectors and completionistsÂ as well between battling, fusing cards, and upgrading your favorites. Â Considering Adventure Mode alone has 75 stages, it's also not the type of game you're going to finish quickly… we're coming for you Patch Boomhaur…
Animation Throwdown The Quest for Cards is a freemium game with its fair share of IAP's, but they aren't required to play. It's one we highly recommended if card-battling games or the toons in the title and you can get it for free on Google Play or the App Store.
A new standoff is building over the Patriot Act.
Congress is in the opening rounds of a month-long battle over American spying, in what is likely to be the last best chance for civil libertarians to rein in the National Security Agency (NSA) since Edward Snowden's leaks two years ago.
ADVERTISEMENT
With a critical deadline to renew the act looming at the end of May, lawmakers have already begun to stake out their positions in the most heated fight over intelligence powers in years.
Here are five things you need to know about the coming fight:
1.) When's the deadline?
On June 1, three portions of the Patriot Act — the national security law passed in the days after Sept. 11, 2001 — are set to expire. But Congress is out of session because of Memorial Day for the last week of the month, so the effective deadline is May 22.
Among the expiring provisions is Section 215, the controversial measure that allows the government to collect “any tangible thing” that is “relevant” to an investigation into suspected terrorists or foreign spies.
Edward Snowden's leaks in the summer of 2013 showed how the National Security Agency has used that language to collect “metadata” about millions of Americans phone calls without warrants. Since then, civil libertarians have targeted Section 215 for reform.
The phone records include information about the two numbers involved in a call, when the call took place and how long it lasted — but not the actual details of the conversation.
The other expiring sections expand the ability of the government to track potential “lone wolf” attackers and also allow intelligence agencies to obtain surveillance orders that cover multiple unidentified devices, which officials say is crucial to track suspects who switch from one phone to another, for instance.
2.) What happens if Congress fails?
According to the White House, the NSA's phone records program will end completely.
“If Section 215 sunsets, we will not continue the bulk telephony metadata program,” National Security Council spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement in March.
For some critics of the NSA, that would be welcome news. But the Obama administration and most lawmakers say it would handicap U.S. officials trying to stop terrorists.
“If that tool is taken away from us ... and some untoward incident happens that could have been thwarted if we had had it, I hope that everyone involved in that decision assumes the responsibility and it not is blamed, if we have another failure, exclusively on the intelligence community,” Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in March.
“The sky wouldn't fall,” Office of the Director of National Intelligence general counsel Robert Litt said on Friday. However, “there are kinds of records we will not be able to get if 215 expires.”
3.) What are Congress's options?
Lawmakers essentially have three options before them.
On the one hand, they can do a “clean” reauthorization of the law without changes. That's the route preferred by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse to push back at Trump on border Democrats block abortion bill in Senate Overnight Energy: Climate protesters storm McConnell's office | Center-right group says Green New Deal could cost trillion | Dire warnings from new climate studies MORE (R-Ky.) and Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr Richard Mauze BurrHillicon Valley: Senators urge Trump to bar Huawei products from electric grid | Ex-security officials condemn Trump emergency declaration | New malicious cyber tool found | Facebook faces questions on treatment of moderators Key senators say administration should ban Huawei tech in US electric grid Five tantalizing questions about Mueller's investigation MORE (R-N.C.), who recently introduced legislation to extend the law until 2020.
But it appears unlikely that plan could get through either chamber of Congress, given the heavy opposition from civil liberties advocates on both sides of the aisle. Even Burr admits their legislation is largely an opening bid, and will likely have to include changes to win lawmakers' support.
At the other end of the spectrum, lawmakers could do nothing, and allow the law to lapse. Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulThe Hill's Morning Report — Emergency declaration to test GOP loyalty to Trump The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump escalates fight with NY Times The 10 GOP senators who may break with Trump on emergency MORE (R-Ky.) has previously pledged to vote against any legislation that reauthorized the Patriot Act, and about a dozen House lawmakers have rallied behind legislation to kill the law entirely.
That plan could garner even less support than the effort to renew the law in its entirety, however, amid growing fears about the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and other threats.
What appears most likely is a reauthorization of the current law, along with some changes to acknowledge concerns about privacy and government transparency.
In the House, Judiciary Committee leaders have rallied around legislation, the USA Freedom Act, that would stop the NSA from storing people's phone records, and instead force the agency to obtain the information from private companies, among other changes.
The bill would also limit the collection of information under other surveillance tools, such as “national security letters,” which request companies to turn over data. It would also add new transparency provisions and place a new expert panel on the shadowy Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
That plan will likely meet resistance from both factions, however, and its path forward remains uncertain in the Senate, where some key lawmakers have expressed skepticism.
4.) Has Congress tried to reform the law before?
Yes, and it failed.
Last year, the House passed a pared-down bill to end the NSA's record keeping, though opponents said that it was riddled with loopholes that would have still allowed the agency to collect records about huge amounts of people at once, such as everyone in a certain area code.
The effort hit a wall in the Senate, when Democrats tried to push it across the finish line before handing control of the upper chamber to Republicans.
Sen. Patrick Leahy Patrick Joseph LeahySenate plots to avoid fall shutdown brawl Booker wins 2020 endorsement of every New Jersey Democrat in Congress The Hill's Morning Report - Can Bernie recapture 2016 magic? MORE's (D-Vt.) earlier version of the USA Freedom Act won the support of a handful of Republicans — such as Sens.

Sen. Bill Nelson Clarence (Bill) William Nelson2020 party politics in Puerto Rico There is no winning without Latinos as part of your coalition Dem 2020 candidates court Puerto Rico as long nomination contest looms MORE (D-Fla.) joined 57 Republicans to kill the bill.
But last year, lawmakers weren't acting under the threat of a looming deadline. The law's upcoming expiration date should force action this time around.
5.) Will it be an issue in 2016?
Yes, and the political jockeying has already started.
Sentiments about government surveillance tend to transcend party lines, and the issue could prove to be a lightening rod among Republican presidential candidates.
Paul has been the most outspokenly critical of the NSA, and even launched a lawsuit against the Obama administration for programs they say violate the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. But Cruz has cosponsored a new version of the USA Freedom Act this year, and may prove to be an influential voice.
Meanwhile, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) has vigorously defended the records collection programs, which they called “the best part of the Obama administration.” Sens. Marco Rubio Marco Antonio RubioHillicon Valley: Senators urge Trump to bar Huawei products from electric grid | Ex-security officials condemn Trump emergency declaration | New malicious cyber tool found | Facebook faces questions on treatment of moderators Key senators say administration should ban Huawei tech in US electric grid Trump unleashing digital juggernaut ahead of 2020 MORE (R-Fla.) and Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamHouse to push back at Trump on border Trump pressures GOP senators ahead of emergency declaration vote: 'Be strong and smart' This week: Congress, Trump set for showdown on emergency declaration MORE have similarly defended the program.
SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - A Korean-American who runs a Christian NGO in a Chinese city on the border with North Korea is being investigated by Chinese authorities and has had their bank accounts frozen, a source with direct knowledge of the case told Reuters on Thursday.
Peter Hahn, a naturalized U.S. citizen, has been under interrogation by Chinese authorities for the last three weeks and is not permitted to leave the country, said the source, who requested anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the case.
The source did not know what prompted the probe, which coincides with an investigation of a Canadian Christian couple who run a coffee shop in the nearby city of Dandong on suspicion they stole military secrets.
Several people working in the region, or who are in contact with those that do, said Hahn's case appeared to be part of a wider sweep of Christian-run NGOs and businesses along the Chinese side of the border with North Korea.
While China can be suspicious of Christian groups and President Xi Jinping has launched a wide crackdown on underground churches, foreign missionaries usually operate without too much harassment.
Hahn runs a school for ethnic Korean children in the Chinese city of Tumen. Through their Tumen River Area Development Initiative (TRADI) NGO, they also operate several humanitarian projects and joint venture companies inside North Korea, including a local bus service in the Rajin-Songbon (Rason) Special Economic Zone.
The school declined to comment when asked about the case, and Tumen police could not be reached for comment.
A spokesperson at the U.S. embassy in Beijing said they could not provide any information on the matter. Marie Harf, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department in Washington, said they were aware of the reports about Hahn's detention but could not comment further for reasons of privacy.
Hahn's company cars had been confiscated and their bank accounts frozen, the source said, adding that their NGO's humanitarian food shipments to North Korea had been suspended following the freeze.
“OPENLY CHRISTIAN”
The source said that Hahn was a Christian and was open about their faith. A description on its website said Hahn founded the NGO in 1997 to help North Korean refugees in Yanji, the capital of China's autonomous ethnic Korean region, a short drive from Tumen, where Hahn is based.
“TRADI's main goal is to sacrifice themselves for the ministry of God,” a description of the NGO's vision on its website says. “Through the bridge that TRADI built around the community of Tumen and North Korea, we hope to break down the wall of oppression, imprisonment, and injustice.”
North Korea espouses freedom of religion, but it is ranked as one of the world's most oppressive regimes in terms of such freedom, and severely punishes citizens who veer from a state-sponsored ideology that venerates its leaders.
It was not immediately clear why China, North Korea's main ally and economic benefactor, was cracking down on missionaries in the region, but experts said it had cooperated with North Korea in the past along the border.
“North Korean security forces and diplomatic officials are working particularly hard this calendar year to combat growth in religious activities along the border,” said Christopher Green of the Seoul-based Daily NK website, quoting repeated reports from sources both inside North Korea and in cities on the Chinese side of the border.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the reports from inside isolated North Korea.
Christian activists focused on China said the two countries had been collaborating closely, despite an apparent dip in relations between Beijing and Pyongyang.
“In recent years they have not always seen eye to eye, but it's a common interest for both sides to crack down on the border, particularly refugee issues,” said Bob Fu of China Aid, a U.S.-based Christian advocacy group.
China's porous border with North Korea, which snakes through mountains, is a thriving hub of cross-border black market trade as well as a route taken by North Korean refugees fleeing economic hardship and religious and political persecution.
“JERUSALEM OF THE EAST”
“Pyongyang was once known as the Jerusalem of the East,” said David Alton, chairperson of the UK parliament's All-Party Parliamentary Group on North Korea, referring to how the city was a thriving center for missionaries long before Korea was divided.
“North Korea's leadership is well aware that below the surface, secret religious faith remains deep in the hearts of many North Koreans,” they told Reuters.
“Their fear of Christianity has led to suppression, persecution (and) cruel incarceration.”
Many missionaries are drawn to the Rason SEZ, where foreigners, including U.S. citizens, can gain a residence permit and set up joint venture companies with the local government.
While some foreign Christians in sensitive border areas are relatively open about their faith, others are wary of being monitored by North Korea and China and use phrases like “meeting place” to describe underground or house churches.
Buses operated by Hahn's NGO with a North Korean partner in Rason bear a logo resembling a fish, a secret symbol used by early Christians persecution in the Roman Empire.
U.S. missionary Kenneth Bae, sentenced by Pyongyang last year to 15 years hard labor for attempting to overthrow the state, operated businesses in Dandong and used their tour company, Nation Tours, to take foreign missionaries across the border into North Korea.
SOUTH KOREAN FUNDS
Beyond tours, bakeries that produce small, nutritious buns that are distributed to school children and orphans in North Korean border cities are often set up by missionary groups in China, or in North Korea in cooperation with the North Korean authorities.
The bakeries distribute much-needed food to impoverished North Korea, but critics argue such humanitarian aid is often deeply intertwined with religious conversation and salvation.
Hahn, who is based in California but has a residence permit for Rason, also runs a bakery, attached to the school, which has produced bread for North Korea since 2003.
Deliveries of bread from the bakery to North Korean children had been delayed by the freeze of Hahn's funds, the source said.
A proportion of Hahn's funding came from churches in South Korean. Their school received money from Pohang Baptist Church in South Korea, according to a letter from the school's vice principal on the church's website.
The investigation into Canadians Kevin Garratt and their wife Julia Dawn Garratt came a week after Canada took the unusual step of singling out Chinese hackers for attacking a key computer network and lodged a protest with Beijing.
In response, China accused Canada of making irresponsible accusations that lacked credible evidence.
“With the Garratts, that was tit-for-tat with what happened in Canada. Peter Hahn is a different issue, I think it's more related to their faith and the work they were doing,” said David Etter, who was recently forced to close their Christian-run Western restaurant in Yanji, citing a lack of customers.
“He was very open about their faith and why they were doing what they were doing,” they said.
As of today some of my games on some of the platforms are no longer available and the reason I pulled them is simply because they don't make enough profit.
Monstaaa! is not available anymore on any of the platforms. In fact I have just recently sold the IP to other developer. Hopefully they bring the second life to the game!
Meanwhile, Puzzled Rabbit for Android, Blackberry PlayBook, XBLIG and PC is still available.
Apparently indie game development, in particular on mobile platforms, is really tough these days. The way I see things is that iOS / Android gold rush is gone and it's now incredibly difficult to compete when you're a small developer because in order to succeed you not only need an exceptionally good, original and polished game but you also need to be visible on the market. And that takes a lot of hard work, talent and some luck too.
Finally I have to say that I am really glad I tried indie game development as I would otherwise not fully understand why it is so difficult and would probably regret not having tried it. I have also learned a lot and had a really good time while it lasted. If you want to learn more about my 10 month long indie adventure have a look at my past blog posts and try to learn something from it.

Facebook AI Research director Yann LeCun. YouTube/USI Events DeepMind, the AI research lab in London that was acquired by Google in 2014 for a reported £400 million, faces one big problem, according to Professor Yann LeCun, who heads up Facebook's AI research group.
Notably, LeCun believes that DeepMind, which employs over 250 people and today sits under Alphabet (Google's parent company), is too far away from California.
"The challenge I think that DeepMind has is that it's geographically separated from the mothership in California and that makes it very difficult to build technology that can be used in products," LeCun told Business Insider during an interview in London last week. "So it pushes DeepMind to some extent to try to survive on its own."
DeepMind declined to comment on this story but it would likely argue that being based in the UK is not a barrier when it comes to working with product and research teams across Google and the rest of the Alphabet group.
While DeepMind's technology may not be prevalent in all of Google's products, the search giant announced in July that it had found one very important use for DeepMind's self-learning algorithms.
Google said it has been able to reduce the energy consumption of its data centre cooling units — used to stop Google's self-built servers from overheating — by as much as 40% with the help of a DeepMind AI system. That's going to be quite a large saving, given Google said it used 4,402,836 MWh of electricity in 2014, equivalent to the average yearly consumption of about 366,903 US family homes, according to Bloomberg.
DeepMind CEO and cofounder Demis Hassabis with Go champion Lee Se-Dol and Google cofounder Sergey Brin. Google
LeCun said that DeepMind's forays into building healthcare applications are an example of how the company is operating relatively independently. They also said that DeepMind it's putting a big emphasis on communication and public relations because "that's important for the group as a whole. Particularly if it's more difficult for them them to produce products."
Prior to Google's acquisition of DeepMind, there were rumours that Facebook was also interested in buying the startup, which was cofounded in 2010 by Oxbridge graduates Demis Hassabis and Mustafa Suleyman, along with UCL academic professor Shane Legg.
When asked about the rumours and whether DeepMind would have been a good acquisition for Facebook, LeCun said: "You know, things played out the way they played out. There's a lot of very good people at DeepMind."
They added: "I think the nature of DeepMind eventually would have been quite a bit different from what it is now if DeepMind had been acquired by a different company than Google."
Google and Facebook are competitors in some areas of their businesses but the companies are also working together to advance the field of AI. "It's very nice to have several companies that work on this space in an open fashion because we build on each others ideas," said LeCun. "So whenever we come up with an idea, very often DeepMind will build on top of it and do something that's better and vice versa. Sometimes within days or months of each other we work on the same team. They hire half of my students."
Who would have guessed Joey knew so much about cars? (BBC America)
“Top Gear” — the hugely popular show where cool cars drive like crazy — is back! Before assessing the new season (9 p.m. Mondays on BBC America), we need to review the past.
Last year, co-host Jeremy Clarkson was suspended from the show. They have a history of making racist and other inappropriate remarks. Then one day during filming they got so mad that their producer couldn't rustle up a hot dinner for them that they punched the producer's face.
More than a million fans signed a petition urging that Clarkson keep their job.
They didn't. And their co-hosts resigned in solidarity.
But the show must go on, or else its worldwide audience of 350 million would be sad. So “Top Gear” hired several new hosts, notably Chris Evans (no, not the movie star, but rather a middle-aged British TV personality who wears black-framed nerd glasses) and Matt LeBlanc (yes, the former “Friends” star).
Evans is annoyingly hyper. LeBlanc is kind of phlegmatic, like, “Yeah, I'm here flashing my killer smile. Now give me my paycheck.”
Despite the less than thrilling hosts, the premiere got off to a fast start. A Dodge Viper ACR, with “bespoke sticky tires,” raced a Chevrolet Corvette Z06 through a course at the U.S. Air Force “Top Gun” academy in Nevada. A race car driver was at the wheel of each muscle car, with a pilot as front-seat passenger. The Viper won, though the Corvette was handicapped: Its driver, Sabine “I feel the need for speed” Schmitz, had to stop to let their pilot take a puke break.
But the show lost momentum with a dragged-out U.S. vs. U.K. race between Evans and LeBlanc. They drove rickety three-wheeled Reliant vehicles through chilly rain; LeBlanc's car kept stalling. They switched to jeeps, towed ice cream vans and drove up a muddy mountain. None of this makes for especially riveting TV.
Equally unimpressive was Evans' interview with chef Gordon Ramsay and actor Jesse Eisenberg, who shared uninteresting memories of cars they'd owned.
There's a lot more drama in the Twitter fight about the show than in the show itself. Clarkson fans are tweeting that studio segments featured “canned laughter” and that “hardly anyone claps.” Last week Evans tweeted in reply, “ ‘Top Gear' audience grew throughout the hour [of the premiere].” The battle is on!

For the first time in excavations of ancient Near Eastern sites, a winery has been discovered within a Canaanite palace. The winery produced high-quality wine that helped the Canaanite ruling family to impress their visitors -- heads of important families, out-of-town guests, and envoys from neighboring states. "All the residents of the Canaanite city could produce simple wine from their own vineyards. But just before it was served, the wine we found was enriched with oil from the cedars of Lebanon, tree resin from Western Anatolia, and other flavorings, such as resin from the terebinth tree and honey. That kind of wine could only be found in a palace," says Prof. Assaf Yasur-Landau of the Maritime Civilizations Department at the University of Haifa, one of the directors of the excavation. The full findings of the 2015 excavation season was presented at the conference "Excavations and Studies in Northern Israel," which took place at the University of Haifa, and in May 16 at the Oriental Institute in Chicago.
The excavations at the Canaanite palace at tel Kabri, which was established around 3,850 years ago during the Middle Bronze Age (around 1950-1550 BCE), are continuing to yield surprises and to provide evidence of a connection between wine, banquets, and power in the Canaanite cities. Two years ago, around 40 almost-complete large jars were found in one of the rooms, and chemical analysis proved that they were filled with wine with special flavorings, such as terebinth resin, cedar oil, honey, and other plant extracts. "This was already a huge quantity of jars to find in a palace from the Bronze Age, and we were really surprised to find such a treasure," says Prof. Yasur-Landau, who is directing the excavation together with Prof. Eric Cline of George Washington University, and Prof. Andrew Koh of Brandeis University.
In this early excavation the researchers already found openings leading into additional rooms. They devoted 2014 to analyzing the findings from the excavation, particularly the chemical analysis of the wine residues. During the 2015 excavation season, conducted in the summer, the researchers returned to the ancient rooms, not knowing what awaited them.
The northern opening led to a passage to another building. Both sides of the passage were lined with "closets" containing additional jars. The southern opening led to a room that was also full of jars buried under the collapsed walls and roof. This was clearly an additional storeroom. "We would have happily called it a day with this discovery, but then we found that this storeroom also had an opening at its southern end leading to a third room that was also full of shattered jars. And then we found a fourth storeroom" relates Prof. Yasur-Landau.
But the surprises kept on coming. As in the previous seasons, each of the new jars was sampled in order to examine its contents. The initial results showed that while all the jars in the first storeroom were filled with wine, in the other storerooms some of the jars contained wine, others appear to have been rinsed clean, while others still contained only resin, without wine. "It seems that some of the new storerooms were used for mixing wines with various flavorings and for storing empty jars for filling with the mixed wine. We are starting to think that the palace did not just have storerooms for finished produce, but also had a winery where wine was prepared for consumption." Prof. Yasur-Landau added that this is the first time that a winery has been found in a palace from the Middle Bronze Age.
They add that the new findings, together with the evidence from previous years of select parts of sheep and goats, have strengthened our understanding of the way rulers used splendid banquets to strengthen their control. "In this period it was not normal practice to mix wine beforehand. Accordingly, in order to provide guests with high-quality wines, the palace itself must have had a winery where they made prestigious wine and served it immediately to guests. These splendid banquets, which in addition to wine also included choice joints of sheep and goat, were the way rulers stayed in touch with their 'electorate' at the time -- not only the heads of important extended families, but also guests from other cities and foreign envoys." On the basis of ancient Ugaritic documents, the value of the wine in the storeroom can be estimated at a minimum of 1,900 silver shekels -- an enormous sum that would have been sufficient, for example, to purchase three merchant ships. By way of comparison, an ordinary laborer in the same period would have to work for 150 years to earn this sum.
At five past seven this morning I interviewed on Radio Wales (here, 1 hour 10 minutes in).
The news we were discussing?
That 52 top scientists from all around the world who have written to the WHO in protest at their policy on electronic cigarettes.
One Billion Preventable Deaths
The WHO is forecasting one billion preventable deaths from tobacco this century.
But scientists from 15 different countries believe that electronic cigarettes can massively help reduce the number of deaths.
IF the WHO reconsiders its policy of classifying ecigarettes as tobacco, and starts seeing ecigarettes as part of the solution rather than the problem.
One of the scientists, Gerry Stimson, Emeritus Professor at the Imperial College in London, argued that:
“If the WHO gets its way and extinguishes e-cigarettes, it will not only have passed up what is clearly one of the biggest public health innovations of the last three decades that could potentially save millions of lives, but it will have abrogated its own responsibility under its own charter to empower consumers to take control of their own health, something which they are already doing themselves in their millions.”
Professor John Britton of the Royal College of Phsycians agreed, adding:
“E-cigarette use has been a consumer led revolution and grown as a bottom-up public health initiative that could save millions of lives,” said John Britton, Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Nottingham, UK. “It has moved at a speed that shows just how much smokers want and will choose nicotine products that don't kill. I hope the WHO and all public health decision makers can recognise and harness the health opportunities that e-cigarettes can provide.”
Obviously, this also has huge implications for the government in Wales, which is doing its best to stamp out electronic cigarettes.
As we've noted before, similar legislation in Spain has lead to a 70% decrease in the sales of ecigarettes.
It is quite possible that historians will look back at this period in history, note the huge opportunity we had to save lives, and say that our politicians had blood on their hands.
Scientists Putting Their Own Career At Risk
What the media won't cover is the risk these scientists are taking.
ECigarette Researcher Riccardo Polosa told me at the ECigarette Summit that researchers are risking future funding by supporting ecigarettes.
Pharmaceutical companies (which produce competing nicotine cessation aids) and other anti-ecigarette organisations control much of the funding for research. And when scientists speak out about the potential of electronic cigarettes, they risk losing out on future research opportunities.

PRIME MINISTER Kevin Rudd is in hot water with the governor of Alabama for their response to comedian Robin Williams' "Australians are basically English rednecks" jibe.
Williams made the joke on the David Letterman's TV talkshow earlier in the week and Rudd, during a radio interview yesterday, hit back by recommending the comedian "spend a bit of time in Alabama before they frame comments about anyone being particularly redneck".
Rudd's reference to Alabama and rednecks generated a terse response from Alabama governor Bob Riley.
"I'm not sure if Prime Minister Rudd has ever been to Alabama," Riley responded in a statement.
"If they have, they would know that Alabamians are decent, hardworking, creative people."
Robin Williams was recently in Australia voicing a character in the animated film sequel Happy Feet 2 and spoke about their visit during the Letterman TV talkshow appearance.
"The Australians are basically English rednecks," Williams said.
"I realised if Darwin had landed in Australia, they would've said 'I'm wrong, I don't know what I was thinking'... You look at some of these animals and realise there was an open bar in heaven on the last day."
Rudd responded to the Oscar-winning actor-comedian's joke during an interview on Eddie Maguire's Triple M radio show.
"First of all, I think Robin Williams should go and spend a bit of time in Alabama before they frame comments about anyone being particularly redneck," Rudd told Maguire.
In response, the Alabama governor pointed to Australian company Austral's decision to invest heavily in Alabama.
"That's why Alabama is home to Australian companies like Austral which employs more than 1000 Alabamians at the world's largest aluminium shipyard," Riley said.

The Armenian genocide was the ruthless slaughter of millions of Armenians by the Turks of the Ottoman Empire. In 1915, during World War I, leaders of the Turkish government set in motion a plan to expel and massacre Armenians. By the early 1920s, when the massacres and deportations finally ended, between 600,000 and 1.5 million Armenians were dead, with many more forcibly removed from the country. Today, most historians call this event a genocide: a premeditated and systematic campaign to exterminate an entire people. However, the Turkish government still does not acknowledge the enormity or scope of these events.
The Roots of Genocide: The Ottoman Empire
The Armenian people have made their home in the Caucasus region of Eurasia for some 3,000 years. For some of that time, the kingdom of Armenia was an independent entity: At the beginning of the 4th century A.D., for instance, it became the first nation in the world to make Christianity its official religion.
But for the most part, control of the region shifted from one empire to another. During the 15th century, Armenia was absorbed into the mighty Ottoman Empire.
The Ottoman rulers, like most of their subjects, were Muslim. They permitted religious minorities like the Armenians to maintain some autonomy, but they also subjected Armenians, who they viewed as “infidels,” to unequal and unjust treatment.

Christians had to pay higher taxes than Muslims, for example, and they had very few political and legal rights.

In spite of these obstacles, the Armenian community thrived under Ottoman rule. They tended to be better educated and wealthier than their Turkish neighbors, who in turn grew to resent their success.
This resentment was compounded by suspicions that the Christian Armenians would be more loyal to Christian governments (that of the Russians, for example, who shared an unstable border with Turkey) than they were to the Ottoman caliphate.
These suspicions grew more acute as the Ottoman Empire crumbled. At the end of the 19th century, the despotic Turkish Sultan Abdul Hamid II – obsessed with loyalty above all, and infuriated by the nascent Armenian campaign to win basic civil rights – declared that they would solve the “Armenian question” once and for all.
“I will soon settle those Armenians,” they told a reporter in 1890. “I will give them a box on the ear which will make them…relinquish their revolutionary ambitions.”
The First Armenian Massacre
Between 1894 and 1896, this “box on the ear” took the form of a state-sanctioned pogrom.
In response to large scale protests by Armenians, Turkish military officials, soldiers and ordinary men sacked Armenian villages and cities and massacred their citizens. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians were murdered.
Young Turks
In 1908, a new government came to power in Turkey. A group of reformers who called themselves the “Young Turks” overthrew Sultan Abdul Hamid and established a more modern constitutional government.
At first, the Armenians were hopeful that they would have an equal place in this new state, but they soon learned that what the nationalistic Young Turks wanted most of all was to “Turkify” the empire. According to this way of thinking, non-Turks – and especially Christian non-Turks – were a grave threat to the new state.
World War I Begins
In 1914, the Turks entered World War I on the side of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. (At the same time, Ottoman religious authorities declared jihad, or holy war, against all Christians except their allies.)
Military leaders began to argue that the Armenians were traitors: If they thought they could win independence if the Allies were victorious, this argument went, the Armenians would be eager to fight for the enemy.
As the war intensified, Armenians organized volunteer battalions to help the Russian army fight against the Turks in the Caucasus region. These events, and general Turkish suspicion of the Armenian people, led the Turkish government to push for the “removal” of the Armenians from the war zones along the Eastern Front.
Armenian Genocide Begins
On April 24, 1915, the Armenian genocide began. That day, the Turkish government arrested and executed several hundred Armenian intellectuals.
After that, ordinary Armenians were turned out of their homes and sent on death marches through the Mesopotamian desert without food or water.
Frequently, the marchers were stripped naked and forced to walk under the scorching sun until they dropped dead. People who stopped to rest were shot.
At the same time, the Young Turks created a “Special Organization,” which in turn organized “killing squads” or “butcher battalions” to carry out, as one officer put it, “the liquidation of the Christian elements.”
These killing squads were often made up of murderers and other ex-convicts. They drowned people in rivers, threw them off cliffs, crucified them and burned them alive. In short order, the Turkish countryside was littered with Armenian corpses.
Records show that during this “Turkification” campaign, government squads also kidnapped children, converted them to Islam and gave them to Turkish families. In some places, they raped women and forced them to join Turkish “harems” or serve as slaves. Muslim families moved into the homes of deported Armenians and seized their property.
Though reports vary, most sources agree that there were about 2 million Armenians in the Ottoman Empire at the time of the massacre. In 1922, when the genocide was over, there were just 388,000 Armenians remaining in the Ottoman Empire.
Did you know? American news outlets have also been reluctant to use the word “genocide” to describe Turkey's crimes. The phrase “Armenian genocide” did not appear in the New York Times until 2004.
Armenian Genocide Today
After the Ottomans surrendered in 1918, the leaders of the Young Turks fled to Germany, which promised not to prosecute them for the genocide. (However, a group of Armenian nationalists devised a plan, known as Operation Nemesis, to track down and assassinate the leaders of the genocide.)
Ever since then, the Turkish government has denied that a genocide took place. The Armenians were an enemy force, they argue, and their slaughter was a necessary war measure.
Today, Turkey is an important ally of the United States and other Western nations, and so their governments have likewise been reluctant to condemn the long-ago killings. In March 2010, a U.S. Congressional panel at last voted to recognize the genocide.
However, little has changed in Turkey: Despite pressure from Armenians and social justice advocates throughout the world, it's still illegal in Turkey to talk about what happened to Armenians during that era.
One of the biggest challenges of our time is climate change. The world struggles to get our ongoing path to environmental destruction under control. Today is Earth Day. This day is for most people about avoiding meat, taking public transport, using reusable shopping bags, drinking wine instead of beer, and turning lights off – but nerds can do more than that. Our biggest challenge is to reduce the climate gas emissions from transport.
Information technology has a gigantic role to play in the solution to that problem:
Self-driving cars, buses, metros make public transport cheaper. But can they be hacked? Of course they can.
Smart assistants using AI to help plan your day, your travel and to optimize your choices also with regard to environmental footprint can do a lot. But can they be hacked, thereby destroying all hope of privacy protection? Sure they can.
Telework can reduce the need to travel to work, and the need for business travel to talk to people in other locations. This brings a whole swath of issues: privacy, reliability. If people don't trust the solutions for communication, system access, and if they don't work reliably, people will keep boarding planes to meet clients and driving cars to go to the office.
Cloud services are nice. They make working together over distances a lot easier. Cloud services require data centers. If the reliability of a data center is not quite up to expectations the standard solution is to replicate everything in another datacenter, or for the customer perhaps to replicate everything in their or their own datacenter, or possibly mirroring it to another cloud provider. This may not be seen as necessary if the reliability is super-good with the primary provider – particularly the ability to deal with DDoS attacks. Building reliable datacenters is therefore part of the climate solution – in addition to providing datacenters with green energy and efficient cooling systems.
OK, so DDoS is a climate problem? Yes, it is. And what do cybercriminals need to perform large-scale DDoS attacks? They need botnets. They get botnets by infecting IoT devices, laptops, phones, workstations and so on with malware. Endpoint security is therefore, also, a climate issue. Following sensible security management is therefore a contributor to protecting the environment. So in addition to choosing the bus over the car today, you can also help Mother Earth by beefing up the security on your private devices:
Make sure to patch everything, including routers, cell phones, laptops, smart home solutions, alarm systems, internet connected refrigerators and the whole lot.
Stop using cloud services with sketchy security and privacy practices. Force vendors to beef up their security by using your consumer power. And protect your own interests at the same time. This is doing everyone a favor – it makes AI assistants and such trustworthy, making more people use them, which favors optimized transport, consumption and communications.
Prioritize efficient, safe and secure telework. Use VPN when working from coffee shops, and promote the “local work global impact” way of doing things. Being able to avoid excessive travel, whether it is to the office or to a client on the other side of the globe, your decisions have impact. Especially if you manage to influence other people to prioritize the same things.
I finally had a chance to catch up on Apple's latest keynote, which saw CEO Tim Cook announce some additional details about Apple Watch and of course, its pricing. The company also announced a new kind of Macbook — pretty amazing actually — and some other newish offerings such as HBO Now on Apple TV. As I sat and watched through the keynote video, one thing which became pretty obvious — Apple's number one focus going forward is China.
For me nothing reflected the importance of China more than the fact that the keynote opened with the date and time in Chinese language characters and the first few minutes being devoted to Chinese retail operations. It shouldn't have surprised anyone: last year, Cook told Sina, a Chinese news organization that it plans to open 25 new stores in greater china over two years, in addition to 15 it already had in operation. In the last six weeks Apple has opened six stores in China. Cook has visited China about half a dozen times. And they should — for China is making shiploads of money for Apple.
Maybe, it's just me who finds it a little ironic that the country which actually assembles the iPhone is now the second largest market for the iPhone after the US. It might actually be on its way to become the largest — a UBS research estimate put China's share of iPhone sales at about 36 percent of the total.
Apple's revenues went up from $12.7 billion in 2011 to $29.8 billion in 2014. At Goldman Sachs conference, Cook is rumored to have said that they have been studying China for 30 years and that “I think we're still not too far from the surface” in opportunity terms. That should be good news for the company since the year-over-year growth in its two major markets – Americas and Europe (where the revenues are already large) is starting to moderate, but China is going strong and picking up steam. Analysts estimate it is only a matter of time before China becomes bigger than Europe.
China, also might be behind Apple's products having taken a golden hue. I wonder if Steve Jobs would have approved of the gold laptops and iPhones, but one can't argue with the logic. When iPhone 5S came out in gold, it quickly was in short supply, especially in China and other Asian countries. I suspect that the new gold Macbook is going to have a similar impact. I point this out, merely because there is a love affair between the Chinese and gold jewelry. The gold consumption in that country is going through the roof. (In 2014, the worldwide consumption of gold fell and yet, China demand still stayed strong.)
Talking about gold, some believe that the Apple Watch Edition (the expensive kind) will find more takers in China than anywhere else in the world. It makes sense — considering average American doesn't much care for the watch, and even when they do, they at a moderate price point. Time magazine writer puts it best:
While Americans will compare the Apple Watch's $349-$17,000 price tag to the cost of consumer electronics, Chinese consumers are more likely to stack it up against luxury timepieces. The worldwide median price of a luxury watch is about $10,700, according to DLG. That means the Apple Watch Sport (starting $349) and Apple Watch (starting $549) are inexpensive by comparison, while the gold and silver Apple Watch Edition models that start at $10,000 aren't crazy purchases.
Fair point! Vogue China editor-in-chief said: “We embrace new technology and digital products more easily than perhaps people elsewhere.” And if they (i.e., the Chinese consumers) embrace the Apple Watch, then many of these articles that are hating on the Apple Watch wouldn't really matter.

The co-founder of the premium food delivery app Deliveroo has admitted that the company must drive down prices if it is to become a mainstream service, suggesting that restaurants may soon feel the squeeze.
Will Shu, who has raised almost $200m (£135m) in venture capital for the company since it launched in 2013, said that they wanted UK consumers to order two meals a day through the app. “It's ambitious but realistic,” they told the Sunday Telegraph.
“This will take operational changes. We are already mainstream but if we want to increase frequency, getting the price lower is important.”
Deliveroo allows restaurants such as Honest Burger and Wagamama to deliver meals to online customers through the Deliveroo network of drivers.
The start-up takes a small commission from restaurants, and the consumer pays a £2.50 delivery charge on top of the price of the meal.
Former investment banker Mr Shu said that their plan for driving down prices was “top secret” but industry experts believe that Deliveroo may leverage its brand reach to convince restaurants to drop prices.
“There may be room for restaurants to move on the margin,” said Peter Backman, managing director of information and insight agency Horizons, and A food sector specialist.
“Potentially the operator will look at this and think that as long as ingredient and preparation costs are covered I don't need to sell at same price as I do in restaurant because with delivery I don't have to worry about space or staffing costs and this is incremental revenue.”
The restaurants listed on Deliveroo typically do not have their own online or delivery offering, so the app offers a brand-new revenue channel.

“Now that Deliveroo has quite a lot of scale, certainly in London, it can start playing tunes,” Mr Backman said. “Operators and restaurants won't want their products to be sold at discount because it doesn't look good but – hypothetically – there may be meal deals or loyalty discounts.”
Deliveroo is quickly expanding its network of drivers in the UK, with hundreds of vacancies listed on digital jobs boards.
Mr Shu ruled out using drones for deliveries, which could help drive down costs, in all but suburban areas.
Deliveroo now operates in 32 UK cities and is seeking to expand into Germany and France.
Mr Shu said that they wanted Deliveroo to become a viable option for every meal. “If it's raining and you're hungry, I want you to think of Deliveroo immediately,” they said. “We want it to be so affordable and high quality that it's not even a choice in your mind.”

Throughout almost four decades of societal progress in getting more work out of less energy, those who deny the promise of energy efficiency have persisted in a bizarre claim: Any energy savings from efficiency are offset by activities that demand additional energy consumption.
While implausible concerns about “rebound effect” have been around since the mid-19th century, they have not impeded recent progress in improving the efficiency of energy use and reducing its environmental impacts.
The most obvious rebuttal to “rebound effect” claims is the performance of the U.S. economy since the early 1970's: Between 1973 and 2009, U.S. economic production more than tripled even as total U.S. energy use increased by less than a third. If “rebound effect” advocates were right, that record would have been flatly impossible, since savings in energy use would be offset by activities that demand energy, keeping energy use trends in lockstep with economic growth (just as they were for the first three decades after World War II).
That was indeed the confident prediction of some economists when we began our careers in the mid-1970s, and such forecasts lie today on the ash heap of history — along with hundreds of unmourned power plants that never had to be built and mines that never had to be dug.
Yet the same discredited thesis has resurfaced recently in reports by the New Yorker writer David Owen and the iconoclastic Breakthrough Institute, which today released a report subtitled, “A Review of the Literature” (translation: “don't expect anything new”). In the report, the Institute acknowledges that “truly cost-effective energy efficiency measures should be vigorously pursued as they will lead to an improvement in the general welfare.” Since we agree entirely with that conclusion, it is tempting to end the discussion there, but the authors of the study also insist that the “rebound effect” will deny the global environment any benefits following that “improvement in the general welfare,” so an additional word is in order.
We reject the Institute's implication that there is some kind of emerging academic consensus around the “rebound effect.” To the contrary, the most respected academic energy efficiency think tanks such as the UC Davis Center on Energy Efficiency and Stanford's Precourt Institute on Energy Efficiency share the view that energy efficiency delivers big economic and environmental benefits. The reality is that energy efficiency is a huge success story and a key tool to reducing global warming, increasing electric reliability, slashing energy bills for those consumers who can least afford them, and avoids the need to build new costly power plants.
The Breakthrough Institute blames a host of evils on efficiency, but fails to back up their accusations with facts. It acknowledges that serious energy analysis of rebound effects shows them to be “comparatively trivial.” People who insulate their houses don't absorb all the savings by sweltering through the winter, and buyers of efficient refrigerators don't start leaving the doors open gratuitously. But after admitting that studies show rebound effects to be small and getting smaller over time, it tries to create a counter-narrative by inserting warnings that “the available evidence to date remains too limited to draw precise conclusions.”
Efficiency does not mean restraining energy services growth. It means using less for the same amount of service. The skeptics are confusing this trend with the sometimes-on, sometimes-off trend towards more efficiency, and claiming that more efficiency induces more demand for energy services.
The problem is that neither Owen nor the Breakthrough Institute has presented any evidence that this is happening in the real world: All of their examples are devoid of any mention of how efficiency leads to demand for activities that demand more energy, as opposed to other economic factors. Instead, they rely on naïve interpretations of economic theory — the same interpretations that show that cost effective energy efficiency is impossible.
Given the weaknesses of this form of economic theory for the purposes of efficiency analysis, it is even more important than usual to rely on data. The clearest data-focused test of the “rebound” hypothesis is whether an economy that embarks seriously on efficiency policy really can cut its overall energy use. Because without question, if the thesis has any plausibility at all, the answer has to be “no”; or at least “not nearly as much as predicted.”
Fortunately for the cause of economic truth, we have such experiments. California, for one, embarked on a broad set of policy reforms to encourage efficiency and promote renewable energy in 1974.
The influence of energy efficiency policies are helping the whole California economy (California would be the eighth largest national economy in the world if it were a nation) to save much more than one would expect. California is not the only example of a state or country promoting efficiency through policy and then showing divergent usage trends from its neighbors and thus demonstrating that energy really is saved. Perhaps this is why serious studies have found that the economy-wide rebound effect is trivially small.
In my blog, I show how California's projected savings from energy efficiency programs, derived year by year in real time by the California Energy Commission, have resulted in 15 percent reductions; and these programs have resulted in 40 percent reductions compared to the rest of the country.
California is just one example. Other states and several countries that have pursued efficiency policies also demonstrate lower energy usage and growth than those that did not so implement such policies.
Energy efficiency saves energy, increases electric reliability, avoids the need to build new power plants, and saves Americans money. It's really that simple.

It's unclear exactly why, but the Department of Homeland has been operating a "Social Networking/Media Capability" program to monitor the top blogs, forums and social networks online for at least the past 18 months. Based on a privacy compliance review from last November recently obtained by Reuters, the purpose of the project is to "collect information used in providing situational awareness and establishing a common operating picture." Whatever that means. Either way, the list of sites reported by Reuters reveals in a Wednesday afternoon exclusive is pretty intriguing:

West African leaders held a regional summit on Saturday to discuss the political crisis in Mali, in an effort to put a unity government in place and take action against an Islamist separatist movement in the north.
The members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) convened their summit in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou. Civil society leaders from Mali met with five West African presidents.
But the interim leaders of Mali were noticeably absent from the summit meeting. Mali's current president, Dioncounda Traore, has been receiving medical treatment in Paris since they were attacked by protesters in May. No reason was given for the absence of Prime Minister Cheikh Modibo Diarra.
The ECOWAS mediator for the Malian crisis and president of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore, opened the regional summit by saying it was necessary to "take urgent steps to confront the terrorist peril in the north of the country."
Islamist-controlled north
The Islamist group Ansar Dine seized control of Mali's north, a region roughly the size of France, after a coup by renegade military officers in March threw the once stable West African nation into chaos.
Originally, ethnic Tuareg separatists declared the independence of northern Mali in April. But Ansar Dine subsequently managed to defeat the Tuaregs and seize the region for themselves.
Timbuktu is currently under Islamist control
The Islamist group, which is reportedly al-Qaeda affiliated, sparked international outrage recently when its members began destroying the mausoleums of Sufi Muslim saints in the historic city of Timbuktu, a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Ansar Dine, which practices a radical form of Islam, considers the mausoleums to be sacrilegious.
ECOWAS has reportedly drafted plans to deploy some 3,000 troops to the region to push out the Islamists, but such a move would require a United Nations Security Council mandate.
Nearly 200,000 people have fled Mali for neighboring countries since the March coup that threw the country into turmoil. Another 150,000 people are displaced within Mali itself.

Last week a new vulnerability affecting Apache Struts was reported (CVE-2017-5638) that affects the Apache Struts Jakarta Multipart parser. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute code in the affected system by creating a specially crafted Content-Type HTTP header.
Starting last Thursday (March 9, 2017), we have seen a high number of attackers trying to exploit this vulnerability. Different payloads have been observed, with some examples as follows:
As of today, using the telemetry we received from the AlienVault Open Threat Exchange (OTX), we have identified more than 400 unique sources that are attempting to exploit this vulnerability.
Indicators of Compromise
To address this threat, the AlienVault Labs team has created a Pulse in the Open Threat Exchange (OTX) with the collection of payloads that are being delivered.
Recommendations
Since this vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild, our recommendation is to upgrade your Apache Struts version as soon as possible.
The vulnerable versions of Apache Struts are:
Struts 2.3.5 - Struts 2.3.31
Struts 2.5 - Struts 2.5.10
Upgrading to the following versions resolves the vulnerability:
For more information, you can check Apache's documentation HERE.
AlienVault Coverage
AlienVault has released multiple signatures to detect attempts to exploit this vulnerability, which can be found in both our AlienVault USM Appliance and AlienVault USM Anywhere products.
The following example shows a successful detection of the vulnerability within our AlienVault USM Anywhere product, where we observe that a new ‘Webserver attack – Code Execution' alarm has been triggered indicating a successful attack:
This alarm is the result of two events being correlated:
The first event detects the exploitation of CVE-2017-5638 against a Tomcat webserver using a vulnerable version of Apache Struts.
The second event that triggered the alarm is detecting an ELF executable being downloaded from the same host after the exploit has been successful.
We will be monitoring this activity and will update this blog post if we discover new information.
Interim USC coach Ed Orgeron is finding support in the strangest of places. In addition to the vocal backing of a good portion of the USC fan base – even if another part wants athletic director Pat Haden to bring in a proven name, like Texas A&M's Kevin Sumlin – Orgeron's case for becoming the Trojans' permanent coach earned a vote of confidence from an unlikely source:
Lane Kiffin. That would be “ex-USC coach Lane Kiffin,” also known as “the coach Orgeron replaced after a 62-41 loss to Arizona State on Sept. 28.”
In an interview on AM 710, an ESPN affiliate in Los Angeles, Kiffin called the decision to promote Orgeron to the permanent post “easy.” Via Scott Wolf of the Los Angeles Daily News:
Lane Kiffin on 710-AM says #USC should hire Ed Orgeron: “That's easy. That's already done. It should be Ed Orgeron.'' — InsideUSC (@InsideUSC) November 21, 2013
Lane Kiffin on 710-AM: “Ed has done the Pete Carroll thing to the fullest.'' #USC — InsideUSC (@InsideUSC) November 21, 2013
It bears noting that Orgeron is 5-1 since replacing Kiffin, taking all five games against Pac-12 competition – losing only to Notre Dame in a non-conference game – to lift the Trojans back into the Rose Bowl hunt. If the Trojans beat Colorado Saturday and UCLA tops Arizona State, the two bitter rivals would meet on Nov. 30 to decide the Pac-12 South Division.
On Wednesday, Orgeron was named one of the 16 semifinalists for the Maxwell Football Club's Coach of the Year award. According to a spokesperson for the Maxwell Football Club, they are the first interim coach to be named a semifinalist in the award's history.

Tim Aker padded up and down the curved streets of this southeast England town Saturday as a platoon of aides scurried from doorstep to doorstep delivering hand-addressed envelopes holding a letter that contained an appeal to upend British politics.
Just days before Thursday's elections, much of the focus and energy of campaigning is elsewhere around the United Kingdom. But this corner of England remains strategically significant and intensely fought. What happens here this week will help chart the future of the U.K. Independence Party, the anti-immigration, anti-Europe party that has become a vessel for protests by those on the right and the left.
The battle in this area plays out in windswept seaside towns and small inland communities that suffer from economic decline and feelings of neglect that have produced a politics of grievance and resentment toward the existing power structure, in London and Brussels.
Victories in these few districts, including a marquee contest in which party leader Nigel Farage is running, would give the party a toehold in the House of Commons and the possibility to build political foundations in scores of districts nationwide.
Defeats, especially for Farage, would represent a major setback after successes in European parliamentary elections last year, when for the first time a third party outpolled the dominant Conservative and Labor parties in a national election.
Asked the biggest issue in their contest, Aker replied, “We're being forgotten. We've had enough.” They speak about a community whose residents feel overwhelmed by cuts in services and impending changes that would strain the local infrastructure even more. Asked to describe the underlying causes, they said, “You've got 300,000 more people entering the country than leaving. It's that simple.”
Aker plays up their local roots in their campaign literature. “I'm writing to you as the only local candidate on your ballot paper,” they say in the letter being dropped at the doors. “I was here before politics. I will be here long after, in our community.”
They campaign in the district known as Thurrock on the oldest and most basic of political appeals: a pledge to bring home the bacon. Their first priority, should they win, would be something far more prosaic than the hot-button issues outlined in the party's manifesto. They said they want to restore bus service to outer London.
UKIP's polarizing agenda is also outlined in Aker's letter to voters. They vow to be the community's voice and vote to control immigration, to make possible a referendum that would take Britain out of the European Union and to stop foreign aid. Money saved would go to the National Health Service and military veterans.
“These are the priorities of the British people,” Aker writes. “They're my priorities, too.”
That agenda generates both support and backlash. Aker points to a big campaign banner bearing their face that is hanging from the side of a house. A few feet above the banner are paint marks on the bricks, scars from vandalism aimed at UKIP during the European parliamentary elections.
The district is held by the Conservative Party, but Aker says their principal opponent is Polly Billington, a former adviser to Labour Party leader Ed Miliband. They live in London. Aker said they now lead the race and predicted that the party would do better than expected nationally. “We're going to surprise a lot of people,” they said.
Farther north along the seacoast is the town of Clacton. It already is home to a UKIP success story. UKIP politician Douglas Carswell was elected to the House of Commons in a special election in August and is favored to win again on Thursday. They represent half of the UKIP strength in the parliament that was dissolved as the election campaign began weeks ago.
Carswell's roots are in the Conservative Party, and their passions and priorities sound less like those of other UKIP politicians. Their disaffection owes principally to their disappointment with what has happened to the Tories over the past few years. But in their anti-elitist leanings, they reflect the views of others in UKIP.
They once wrote strategy papers for the reformers who helped Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron in their rise to power. They later defected to UKIP when they concluded that Cameron and others were not serious about reform. “I felt they were no longer the vehicle for change this country needs,” they said.
They accused the Tories of being a party of elites, not one worrying about the frustrations of ordinary people in mind. “They're not dissatisfied with the state of the country the way I am,” they said. “They're not dissatisfied with the state of the country the way folk here are. People often smear UKIP as reactionary and backward-looking. I profoundly and fundamentally disagree.”
Farther south, below where the Thames River empties into the sea, is a third district where UKIP is fighting hard. It is the most important of all the districts the party is contesting.
Late on Saturday afternoon, people begin to gather at the Oddfellows hall in Ramsgate. There, Farage is holding their 24th town hall meeting of the campaign. Before they arrive, half a dozen young people walk past on the other side of the street. Noticing the UKIP signs, two offer hand gestures of contempt.
By the time they speak, 125 to 150 people are in the seats. All were invited because they are believed to be undecided.
Farage is the face of the party, and in many ways the entirety of the party in the eyes of the media and the public.  They are a charismatic figure who delivers the UKIP message with full-throated gusto, despite obvious weariness.
Their targets are the European Union bureaucrats in Brussels for exerting control over their country and the Scots up north for demanding more money from the central government in London than they rightly deserve — paid for by the people of England.
Farage is not of the district called Thanet South. They found and is running for a seat that looked winnable, where the Conservative Party incumbent is stepping down. For the people of this district area, they make this promise: “When I say something, people do listen. I will be a national voice for Thanet.”
UKIP is polling in low double digits in the weekend surveys. The Conservatives are trying to squeeze that down, appealing to their disaffected voters to come home. UKIP leaders hope there is support for them below the radar of the surveys. But Britain's voting system can penalize a small party, delivering far fewer seats than its overall percentage of the national vote. Projections show that UKIP would be lucky to have more than three or four seats out of 650 once the balloting is over.
A Farage victory is not assured, however, and they have said that they will step down as party leader if they do not win Thursday. Without Farage, UKIP would lack its most identifiable — and controversial — politician.
Standing in the back of the room as Farage finished was strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe, UKIP's head of campaigning. “If Nigel can break through here — and I think what will happen is we will run second in 100 seats around the country — then in five years' time, I think UKIP will end up doing something extraordinary . . . providing Nigel wins here.”
Many rides on that outcome, for UKIP and for the United Kingdom.
US-based Guor Marial has won the right to compete as a stateless athlete after refusing to compete under Sudan's flag
A refugee from Sudan's civil war has won their battle to compete in the Olympic marathon as an independent runner without a country.
US-based Guor Marial had turned down the chance to run for Sudan, could not represent America because they are not a full citizen and was unable to wear the colours of their first choice, South Sudan, because it is not sending a team to London.
But the 28-year-old's late plea to enter as a stateless athlete under the Olympic flag has now been granted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Marial was preparing for a training session over the weekend when they got the career-changing call.
"I was getting ready to go for a run," Marial told the Associated Press from their home in Flagstaff, Arizona. "Wow. This is so exciting. It's hard to describe. I'm speechless."
Marial lost 28 family members to violence or disease during the civil war that left Sudan devastated and eventually led to the south breaking away last year. They felt that representing Sudan would betray their memory, but competing in the Games this way will honour them.
They told Reuters: "For me, it means a lot to glorify the people who died for their freedom and people who lost their lives, including 28 members of my family and relatives. Their spirit is what allows me to get up every single day, put on my shoes and train honouring them."
They have bleak childhood memories of the conflict. One night, soldiers raided their home, smashing their jaw with a rifle and knocking them unconscious. At the age of eight, they were forced to escape a labour camp after being kidnapped by gunmen. They hid in a cave until dawn, then followed the path of the sun.
"I used to hate running," they told AP. "I was running back home to save my life."
Marial lived in Egypt before reaching the US 12 years ago. They showed promise as a cross-country runner at Iowa State University. Last October they beat the Olympic marathon qualification time and in June improved their personal best to two hours, 12 minutes and 55 seconds.
South Sudan has been torn by economic collapse, tribal violence and a brewing conflict with its northern neighbour since becoming independent little more than a year ago. Establishing an Olympic body is hardly a priority and so it won't be taking part in the Games.
But Marial, whose kit is expected to be Olympic-branded, is looking forward to running for their country in an unofficial capacity on 12 August, the climax of the Games. "To have someone at the Olympics after one year of independence and [knowing] the whole world will see it, that's amazing," they told Reuters.
Marial said they would ask their father, who still lives in South Sudan, to travel to the nearest city to watch them on TV.
In an interview with AP, they added: "South Sudan has finally got a spot in the world community. Even though I will not carry their flag in this Olympic Games, the country itself is there. The dream has come true. The hope of South Sudan is alive."
Refugees International, an advocacy organisation that had lobbied the IOC to allow Marial to participate, welcomed the decision. Michel Gabaudan, its president, said: "It's a great message to Guor Marial and also South Sudan. First they were offered the chance to run for Sudan which they very politely but very firmly turned down for understandable reasons.
"Everyone will know they are from South Sudan and it is great for a young country with all the problems they have. The country needs a bit of good news and we are thrilled."
Three athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles will also compete under the Olympic flag. Should any of them win an event, it is thought the Olympic anthem composed by Spiro Samara will be played in lieu of a national anthem.
Covering the use of photography in military police work and criminal investigations, the 25-minute long video introduces the types of cameras used, explains when each camera should be used and provides important guidelines for ensuring the photographs will be admissible as evidence in court.
Watching it today, the video offers an educational glimpse into photography practices from 50 years ago, provides some laughs and shares a few eternal truths about photography.
Beginning with the importance of proper exposure, the instructor reminders viewers that they, not the camera, are in control of the photographic process. “Keep in mind that a camera is only a tool and can do nothing by itself. Your skill with it determines whether or not the photograph you take will serve its purpose and yours,” they say.
While that is still true to this day, the next part will quickly remind you that this is a movie from 1965 after all.
“Four types of cameras are available for military police work”, the instructor continues, introducing the photographic work tools of the time:
The 4×5 Press Type with synchronized flash is said to be “the workhorse and best all-around camera”.
For surveillance work the 35mm camera is recommended, “since it is small and easy to conceal”. It is said that the camera comes with a variety of wide-angle and telephoto lenses and can also be used for photomicrography and photomacrography.
Next up is the fingerprint camera (You can guess what it does…)
And last but not least is the 16mm motion picture camera used to capture motion picture and normal speed as well as slow-motion footage.
“No camera does everything equally well”, the instructor concludes the gear-introduction section, “and that is of course why there are different types of cameras for different jobs”. (You'd think that 50 years would be enough time to come up with the ultimate all-in-one camera, wouldn't you?)
The movie goes on to explain how to methodically capture “effective photographic evidence that will be accepted in court” in various scenarios such as arson and homicides scenes.
Trap cameras, infra-red photography, ultra-violet photography and even color photography are also discussed, among other uses for both still and motion photography as used by the military police.
It's interesting to see how much has changed in the past 50 years, but maybe even more so how much has remained almost unchanged.
Whether you're interested in the history of photography or the history of law enforcement, I recommend you take a break and watch this video. At the very least it will make you appreciate the technological advances our field has seen, and help you realize that even if you don't have the latest camera you're still way better off than your parents or grandparents were!

WARNING: Distressing content.
SHOCKING bodycam footage has captured a cop accidentally shooting dead a mum after slipping on ice while aiming at the family dog.
Burlington Police Officer Jesse Hill was responding to a disturbance in the US state of Iowa on January 6 when they found Autumn Steele in front of their house hitting their husband, Gabriel, police said.
The 34-year-old woman had spent the previous night in jail after being arrested on domestic abuse charges, according to the Des Moines Register.
Police said Hill fired their gun when the family's German Shepherd, Sammy, jumped on their back and bit him. They slipped on ice and the bullets struck Steele in the chest while the dog was spared.
Steele's three-year-old son witnessed the shooting.
A 12-second clip of the video from Hill's body camera released by authorities showed they fired their gun twice without warning.
“Get your dog!” Hill yelled, as a dog growled in the background. The camera then flipped up to the sky.
The video does not show the pet attacking Hill.
Prosecutors later said the dog attack justified the shooting and Hill was cleared of any charges. They returned to work in March.
Des Moines County Attorney Amy Beavers told KBUR News: “After reviewing the complete DCI investigation, there were no criminal charges that applied to the circumstances of this case.”
However, Steele's family have protested the decision and called for the release of the full bodycam video, footage from the cop's squad car and 911 phone calls.
New York Daily News reports the Iowa Public Information Board has sided with the family, voting on Thursday to launch legal action against the Burlington Police Department and other agencies for the data release.
“I'm, for one, uncomfortable with law enforcement determining what should and shouldn't be released,” Information Board member Bill Monroe, who voted in favour of the lawsuit, said.
Children that are seldom read to and whose parents read very little are at a disadvantage when they start school.
There is a strong connection between a child's reading environment at home from the time they are very young and the progress a child makes in being able to read once they start school. This was the finding of a study undertaken in connection with the On Track research project (http://lesesenteret.uis.no/research/research-projects/on-track/) at the Norwegian Reading Centre (www.lesesenteret.uis.no) at the University of Stavanger (UoS).
"There are big differences among six-year-olds. While many new first grade pupils can already read on their own, others are not even at the point where they understand that letters represent sounds. We know from the research that it is important that children are well prepared for reading when they start school and will be embarking on formal literacy. This study shows that the parents' attitudes to reading, the number of children's books in the home, the age at which parents start reading aloud to children and how often they read to them all determine how well prepared children are to learn to read when starting school," says Vibeke Bergersen.
Bergersen has written the master's thesis "Kan du lese for meg? En studie av elevers leserelaterte ferdigheter ved skolestart sett i sammenheng med lesemiljø i hjemmet" (Institutt for grunnskolelærerutdanning, idrett og spesialpedagogikk, Universitetet i Stavanger, 2015) ("Can you read for me? A study of pupils' reading skills when starting school viewed in the context of the reading environment at home" [The Department of Education and Sports Science, University of Stavanger, 2015]).
BETTER VOCABULARY
The On Track research project is investigating ways of preventing reading and writing difficulties. They studied 1171 first grade pupils and their parents from 19 schools in Rogaland county, Norway. The pupils were tested in various reading and writing skills when they started school in autumn 2014. The parents were asked how often they themselves read, how many children's books they had at home, how often the child was read to and the age of the child when they started reading to the child. The results of this study clearly showed that the greater significance books have in children's lives from the time they are young, the better prepared they are to learn to read when starting school.
"This is because reading early and often to children influences the child's vocabulary and phonological awareness. Phonological awareness is about being aware of different sounds in language and is important in learning the first letters. Children that are often read to encounter linguistic games or rhymes and jingles in children's books. In this way, they become more aware of the connection between letters and sounds. By sitting with an adult who is reading books, children become aware of letters and words, and it will be easier for them to read," Bergersen explains.
READING MORE MEANS A BETTER VOCABULARY
Reading aloud to a child before the child can speak positively influences the number of words the child learns.
"Between the ages of 18 months and about three years of age is the most influential time with regard to language learning. It is therefore important to read to children often from an early age. When starting school, children who have a lot of children's books at home and who have been read to before reaching two years of age have a vocabulary that is almost twice that of children who have few children's books at home and who have only been read to aloud after the age of four years. Children with a large vocabulary understand more of what is going on at school and are better able to keep up with what is being taught. Children with poorer vocabularies understand less, and this can negatively impact their education. During the school years, the pupils must read as part of learning different subjects. This means that it is very important to have good basic reading skills and a good understanding of written material. A child's vocabulary can be enhanced by providing a good reading environment at home," says Bergersen.
They were surprised at the extent to which the parents' own motivation to read influenced children's skills.
"Over one million Norwegians have poor reading skills. Even if parents do not like to read, children should nevertheless be given access to books in other ways. Perhaps parents can ask the nursery school staff to devote more time to stimulating the child to read. Parents can also sit with their child when the child is listening to audio books with text and images on a tablet," they say.
BIG VARIATIONS
Bergersen's study shows that 80% of the parents have taught their children letters before they start school and that as many as 20% of new first grade pupils can read already. "This means that in a class of 30, six pupils will already have started reading by the time they start school. These pupils must be given suitable reading material and teaching should be planned so that pupils who can read and those who have not yet discovered that letters represent sounds are both given challenges suitable for their abilities.
Kjersti Lundetræ, associate professor at the Norwegian Reading Centre, UoS, believes that these findings should have an impact on early reading and writing education in school.
"When pupils have such different skills when starting school, this should influence the amount of group education that is devoted to learning letters, for example. Many pupils know all the letters when starting school and can write quite a bit, but do not necessarily know how the letters are formed. To help the pupils avoid learning awkward spelling methods and to smooth out differences, it may be a good idea to progress faster through the learning of letters than has been the norm. We must also facilitate reading and writing activities that allow for different levels of ability. Pupils who can already read well and pupils who are learning to write need different challenges, and they also need access to different types of reading material. All pupils need to experience achievement and challenges; otherwise, we know that the pupils become demotivated and also become accustomed to accomplishing very little in learning situations.
Lundetræ also highlights the importance of having an overview of individual pupils' skills when they begin first grade. "When children start school, teachers should take time to get to know each individual pupil and undertake and document a short, individual skills' assessment."

Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Doug Jones will be in Huntsville Wednesday as part of a three-city 'Day of Action.'
Jones, who is in a close battle with Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore leading up to the December 12 special election, will hold events in Birmingham, Huntsville and Cullman for their final 'Women's Wednesdays' campaign tour. The goal of the campaign's program is to help bolster female support.
The candidate starts their day in Birmingham at 11 a.m. Jones will be in Huntsville at 3:30 p.m. at 303 Williams Avenue where one of their campaign's phone banks are located. They will then hold a rally with equal pay advocate Lilly Ledbetter and former Alabama First Lady Marsha Folsom in Cullman at 6 p.m at 281 County Road 717.
The Democrat has trailed Moore in a majority of polls, but they have also led in a couple within the past week. Moore has been able to maintain an overall slight lead despite many accusations of inappropriate conduct with teens while they were in their early 30s.
Jones is trying to become the first Alabama Democrat elected to the US Senate in more than 20 years.
Description
It has been total overload on new UniFi gear at the show here today.
For details on the new UniFi 8 switches, see here:
https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Stories/Exciting-new-UniFi-Switch-8-s-shown-at-Wispapalooza/cns-p/1702206
I will try to get details and answer questions on these other items below later. But for now, just want to try and post as many of the items with brief descriptions.
New AC In-Wall
5ghz plus 2ghz and AC performance.
Includes a POE+ port and a straight data port on the bottom.
10-gig UniFi Fiber Switch
Here is a closeup of the lights.
12 SFP+ 10gig SFP ports, plus 4 eithernet ports.
New UniFi Mesh Gear.
There are many new products with the Mesh name. This is the OutDoor. This is like the large AC Outdoor, but has mesh technology to connect without wires as an option.
Here's an unboxing of it:
I threw one quickly up before leaving for Las Vegas. Brief testing saw some awesome range of several 100's of feet with great speeds.
All of these new products (and more I still need to find, I'll try to find the wave2 Sango), need much more explanation and details. But I or someone else will need to do that one product at a time when there's more time.
The Senate and House of Representatives voted to override President Obama's veto of JASTA on Wednesday, legislation that allows 9/11 victims' families to sue Saudi Arabia. It was the first time Obama has faced an override since entering the Oval Office. The Senate vote was not even close, passing on an overwhelmingly bipartisan tally of 97-1. Harry Reid was the only senator to vote to sustain it.
Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), Hillary Clinton's 2016 running mate, was not present for the historic moment.
Unfortunately, the vice presidential nominee could not use geography as an excuse. In a press release, the Republican National Committee pointed out that Kaine was only 10 miles away from Capitol Hill at the time of the vote, appearing at an event in Alexandria, VA.
Sen. Bernie Sanders also missed the vote, for the same reason - they were stumping for Clinton.
Earlier this week, the Clinton campaign indicated Clinton would sign the bill if it reached their desk.
In armed conflicts, each new weapon or technique introduced typically elicits a countermeasure or new move by the opposing side. Such action-reaction cycles can sometimes escalate clashes to levels both sides come to regret. This is the current situation involving Ankara and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and between the Islamic State (IS) and the international coalition confronting it.
As noted Sept. 12 in Al-Monitor, in “Ankara hardening anti-PKK strategy,” the Turkish government, confident in its declaration of a state of emergency and experience gained in its struggle against the Gulen movement, has settled on a strategy of total liquidation of the PKK to the exclusion of attempts at deterrence. In this regard, Ankara last month introduced on the battlefield the Turkish-made medium-altitude, long-endurance Bayraktar TB2 armed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The drone's manufacturer, Baykar Makina, is owned by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's son-in-law Selcuk Bayraktar.
According to announcements by the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), the Bayraktar UAVs killed 18 PKK militants in their first three operations in the rural terrain of Cukurca, in Hakkari province. Media reports said that during Oct. 1-10, when clashes were particularly heavy, about 90 (or 27%) of the 330 PKK fighters killed were hit using Bayraktar TB2s. Currently, the TSK is operating 12 TB2 UAVs in southeast Turkey and also in Operation Euphrates Shield in northern Syria.
The Bayraktar TB2 can climb to 24,000 feet, stay in the air for 24 hours, can receive commands from some 93 miles and is armed with MAM-L laser-guided missiles manufactured by Roketsan, another Turkish company. Because the Bayraktar TB2 enables target acquisition and firing from some 4 miles away, it is a more effective weapons system in counterterror operations than warplanes and assault helicopters, which take time to reach the combat zone and acquire targets. TB2s are also actively being used for close quarters security of critical battalion bases. PKK fighters approaching these permanently stationed units or moving along infiltration routes have now become easy prey for the TB2.
A security source who spoke to Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity said the Bayraktar TB2 has become the TSK's most substantive strategic asset in its counterterror operations. They said that with the expected delivery of more of the drones, the TSK believes it can destroy the PKK in the southeast and with more advanced UAV models can extend pressure to the PKK military presence in Iraq at Qandil, Zap, Avasin-Basyan and Hakurk.
With Turkey having launched armed UAV warfare against the PKK, the question now becomes how will the PKK react to the power asymmetry it faces? The obvious response is bomb-laden vehicles, which are being increasingly used in suicide attacks, as IS has effectively shown in Iraq and Syria. Thus far, the PKK has easily been able to find volunteers willing to die when they are sent to a target, like an armed UAV with the exception of blowing itself up.
On Oct. 6 in the Yenibosna district of Istanbul, 10 people were wounded in an attack claimed by PKK-affiliate Kurdistan Freedom Falcons using a motorcycle-borne improvised explosive device (IED) attack. Near the town of Haymana two days later, some 18 miles from Ankara, two PKK militants stopped at a checkpoint and blew themselves up on their motorcycles that were rigged as vehicle-borne IEDs before reaching their intended target. On Oct. 9, in a suicide attack against a gendarmerie checkpoint near Semdinli, 10 soldiers and six civilians were killed by a truck-borne IED laden with 5 tons of ammonium nitrate fortified with TNT.
Security sources consulted by Al-Monitor said that between Oct. 1 and Oct. 10, eight vehicle-borne IED attacks were thwarted across Turkey through the apprehension of the perpetrators. Turkey is now hastily trying to register all the motorcycles in the country, bar coding large liquefied petroleum gas cylinders used in kitchens and requiring identification for purchasers of them and imposing strict controls on the sale and storage of nitrate-based agricultural fertilizers. Other measures to curtail the PKK's vehicle-borne IED campaign include closer cooperation with rental car companies, aggressive searches for stolen cars and registration of accommodation rentals in major cities. No matter how hard the security agencies might try, such attacks are not easy to prevent.
Part of the Turkish security forces' territory domination doctrine, which is being applied in mountainous terrain in eastern and southeastern Turkey, involves establishing hundreds of temporary small- and medium-scale, self-sustaining military outposts, but it is impossible to provide round-the-clock security for every one of them. Thus the PKK can easily find weak targets on which to inflict heavy casualties and scare the public, thus undermining the psychological upper hand Ankara has achieved through UAV operations. The PKK's goal is a mutually painful stalemate. There is no doubt that the PKK, through its 35 vehicle-borne IED attacks in the past year, has been able to lessen the perception of state supremacy in the struggle.
In short, the more Ankara intensifies efforts to develop armed UAVs, improve its missile technology and target acquisition methods, the more the PKK, in its effort to overcome the power asymmetry, will adopt the methods from its experiences in Syria and Iraq and transfer them to Turkey. This, in turn, portends a sharp escalation in the action-reaction cycle in the field, leading to heavy casualties and destruction. According to the TSK's website, between Aug. 29 and Oct. 10, 417 PKK militants were killed in counterterror operations, while 88 security personnel were killed.
Of note, the TSK website makes no mention of civilians killed, probably because the yardstick for success in armed clashes is the number of enemy personnel killed. Ankara is trying to liquidate the PKK by killing most of its fighters, while the PKK is trying to prove that it is not easy prey. Worse, both sides have ways and means more lethal than the ones they had in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
This is why the Turkish military is carefully watching the efforts of non-state actors, so far mainly IS, to develop their own armed drones, which will likely be emulated by the PKK. French and US sources confirmed on Oct. 12 that IS jihadis had killed two Kurdish fighters and injured two French special operations troops near Mosul using a remote-controlled hobby plane rigged with hidden explosives.
IS has used surveillance drones on the battlefield for some time, but the attacks, all targeting Iraqi troops, have highlighted its success in adapting readily accessible technologies to make potentially effective new weapons. IS is using relatively simple, commercially available drones, such as the DJI Phantom, which can be purchased on Amazon. The group attaches small explosive devices to them, essentially making them remotely piloted bombs. Military analysts believe that drones will continue to be a problem in Iraq and Syria and elsewhere.
A veteran United Nations official with long service in south Lebanon told Al-Monitor how Hezbollah learned from its experiences with Israel and developed its own fleet of armed drones, beginning with toy model planes. Turkish security sources said they recently suffered two mini-drone attacks by IS that went largely unnoticed, one at Syria's al-Rai and the other at the Turkish training camp of Bashiqa, in northern Iraq. No doubt the PKK, always a good learner, is watching carefully.
The TransPacific Partnership trade agreement has been released, and it goes way beyond resolving a few trade and tariff disputes. US and other trade negotiators leaped into a host of policy and legal matters, including the fight over when governments can demand access to encryption keys.
The outcome to the crypto wars is one that no one would have expected: Jim Comey loses. NSA director Mike Rogers loses. But SEC chairperson Mary Schapiro Jo White wins.
In an annex to a chapter on Technical Barriers to Trade, the trade deal specifies that no government may require any company to provide cryptographic keys to its products. http://www.mfat.govt.nz/downloads/trade-agreement/transpacific/TPP-text/8.%20Technical%20Barriers%20to%20Trade%20Chapter.pdf
The only exceptions are for products or networks that actually belong to the government and for “supervisory, investigatory or examination [measures] relating to financial institutions or markets.”
So the trade negotiators have spoken. No point in any more debate. The FBI and NSA are out in the cold, but the chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Commission can require companies to cough up their encryption keys.
UPDATE: Corrected SEC chair's name. My fault, but a Google search for “SEC chairperson” didn't exactly help.
BALTIMORE - Baltimore police released videos Monday showing the arrest of a man who died of a severe spinal injury suffered in police custody. Six officers have been suspended, but investigators say they still don't know how it happened
A week after the arrest of Freddie Gray, police said still don't have any videos or other evidence explaining what happened to cause the "medical emergency" that an arresting officer said Gray suffered while being taken to the local police station, Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez said.
Autopsy results returned Monday show that Gray "did suffer a significant spinal injury that led to their death," Rodriguez said. "What we don't know is how they suffered that injury."
Police also released a more detailed timeline of how Gray was arrested and transported on April 12.

It revealed for the first time that Gray was placed in leg irons after an officer felt they were becoming "irate," that the van made several stops on its way to the police station, even stopping to pick up another prisoner in an unrelated case, after Gray had asked for medical attention several times.
Something must have happened between the time Gray was videotaped by a bystander being dragged into the van, and the time they arrived at the station in deep distress, the deputy commissioner said.
The handwritten report by the arresting officer says Gray "was arrested without force or incident," CBS News correspondent Chip Reid reported.
"When Mr. Gray was put in that van, they could talk, they were upset. And they were taken out of that van, they could not talk and they could not breathe," Rodriguez said.
Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake vowed to provide the community with all the answers.
Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said they are ordering that police review and rewrite "effective immediately" its policies on moving prisoners and providing them with medical attention.
"We are a community on edge right now. We hear, I hear, the outrage. I hear the concern and I hear the fear," Batts said, asking for calm. "We are on edge as a city, and I need your help to make sure we get this out in the proper way."
All six officers involved have been suspended, said Rodriguez, who is in charge of the department's professional standards and accountability.
Officer Garrett Miller's official request for a criminal charge against Gray, a 25-year-old black man who was only 5-foot-8 inches tall and 145 pounds, said that they had been arrested "without force or incident."
Miller sought a charge of carrying a switchblade, punishable by a year in prison and a $500 fine, according to court records obtained Monday by The Associated Press.
Miller's charging document doesn't provide any explanations for the injuries that would lead to Gray's death a week later. They wrote only that while being taken to the station, on April 12, "the defendant suffered a medical emergency and was immediately transported to Shock Trauma via medic."
Another 30 minutes passed before police finally called an ambulance to pick Gray up at the station. They arrived at the hospital in critical condition and died on Sunday after a weeklong coma.
The documents, which misspell Gray's name as "Grey," were first reported Monday by The Baltimore Sun. Police had not previously mentioned a knife, or publicly disclosed the charge against Gray.
Miller's signed report says they personally recovered the knife from Gray's pocket. It names five other officers to be summoned as witnesses in court, and says Gray was stopped after a brief foot chase because they "fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence."
The Gray family's attorney, Billy Murphy, disputed the police timeline and said the injuries Gray suffered while in police custody were fatal. "His spine was 80 percent severed at their neck," Murphy said.
"We have no confidence that the city or the police department is going to fairly and objectively investigate this case," Murphy added.
CBS News reported earlier that Gray's lawyers accuse police of covering up what happened. They say police have video of the arrest itself, and accused the department of withholding it to hide the facts.

Activists protesting excessive use of force and even Baltimore city officials say they have more questions than answers. About 50 people marched from City Hall to police headquarters Monday, carrying signs reading "Black lives matter" and "Jobs, not police killings." They unfurled a yellow banner reading "Stop police terror."
"This is just one of the most egregious cases I've ever seen," said Colleen Davidson of the Baltimore People's Power Assembly, which they said organized the rally at the request of Gray's family. "We felt the need to be out here and make it known that we will not stand and watch things like this happen."
Rodriguez said their investigators will hand everything they find over to the office of State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby by May 1. They too appealed Monday for anyone with information to contact their office.
"I can assure the public that my office has dedicated all its existing resources to independently investigate this matter to determine whether criminal charges will be brought," Mosby said.
Results
We have reviewed all comments made during the consultation period and have issued our Response to Issues Raised report.
Nine Elms Lane Response to Issues Raised report (PDF 1.05MB)
Following careful consideration of the consultation responses, we have reached a decision about our proposals as follows:
Sections 1 to 3 (from Macduff Road to adjacent to Stewart's Road)
We continue to work closely with the London Borough of Wandsworth to review and modify our proposals for these sections, and to understand the impact this will have on the local area. Our review of these sections is looking to provide enhanced provision for cyclists and pedestrians.
We aim to reach a decision and provide further update about our proposals for these sections, including an updated response to issues raised report, in early 2019.
Sections 4 to 7 (Stewart's Road to Lassco)
We are progressing our designs for these sections, taking into account the comments received. We are committed to working with the London Borough of Wandsworth to progress with detailed designs which include improved pedestrian space, stepped cycle tracks and bus stop bypasses.
Subject to securing the necessary technical and governance approvals, construction on the scheme as a whole is likely to take place between 2020 and 2021.
Local residents will be aware of the ongoing changes in the area resulting from different phases of the development work. Along with the London Borough of Wandsworth, we are committed to minimising the long term impact of construction on local residents, businesses and other stakeholders.
We will coordinate our proposals with other schemes in area including the Northern line extension and Vauxhall Cross. We continue to work with developers to influence interim changes in the area, and to embed the principles of our proposals as part of the development works. This also includes working with utility companies so utility locations and connections are future-proofed, wherever possible, to minimise utility work during the delivery of our proposed changes along Nine Elms Lane and Battersea Park Road.
Results Updated 19 Mar 2018
Between 3 July 2017 and 20 August 2017, we consulted on proposals to transform the 2.5km stretch of road from the Vauxhall Gyratory, along Nine Elms Lane and Battersea Park Road to Macduff Road, connecting to Cycle Superhighway 8 (CS8).
We received 930 responses to our consultation questionnaire online or through a paper copy (for example, completed the questionnaire at an exhibition) or by unique email. Of those who responded, 30 per cent strongly supported the overall proposals while 13 per cent partially supported, 8 per cent partially opposed, 46 per cent strongly opposed, 3 per cent neither supported nor opposed, and less than 1 per cent had no opinion.
We also received a number of responses directly from stakeholders which are included in the report.
A full report detailing our analysis of the consultation is available below.
Nine Elms Lane Consultation Report (PDF 3.43MB)
The consultation was an extremely valuable exercise in understanding views on our proposals for Nine Elms Lane and Battersea Park Road.
Taking into account a significant number of responses about sections 1 to 3 of the proposed scheme, we are reviewing the principles of the design for these sections.
We are progressing the proposed design for sections 4 to 7 of the route. We continue to review the comments received during the consultation to further develop the design for sections 4 to 7 of the scheme.
We plan to publish a detailed response to the issues raised during consultation, as well as a decision on how to proceed, during summer 2018.
We will continue working with the London Borough of Wandsworth and other key stakeholders to ensure a coordinated approach with other development works in the area.
PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — A confrontation between a Pittsburgh City Councilwoman, who is also a mayoral candidate, and a bicyclist over the city's controversial bike lanes was caught on video.
Stu Strickland is a cycling advocate who wears a GoPro camera mounted on their chest to document any cases of motorists behaving badly.
KDKA's Andy Sheehan: “You're an advocate. Some people might say you have a chip on your shoulder. You're going around with this GoPro, you're looking for people to offend you?”
Strickland: “I'm not looking to offend people, but I'm looking for people who are offensive.”
This past summer, on the computer programmer's daily commute from McCandless, they say they had one such encounter with a driver in an SUV, whom they say drove up on their tail and honked.
When they confronted that driver, Strickland says it turned out to be City Councilwoman Darlene Harris, who is a mayoral candidate. The confrontation was caught on the GoPro.
Strickland: “What's your problem?”
Harris: “Stay in the damn bike lane.”
Strickland: “I am entitled…”
Harris: “Why do you think we put them there for?”
Strickland: “Pull over!”
Harris: “Idiot.”
Harris can't actually be seen in the video, but when KDKA's Andy Sheehan showed the councilwoman the video, they confirmed the voice is hers, and they make no apologies for it.
Harris: “That's what I told him, stay in the bike lane.”
Sheehan: “Stay in the damn bike lane?”
Harris: “Exactly.”
Sheehan: “And that's what they ought to do?”
Harris: “Well, don't you think if there's bike lanes that the city put in, they should be in the bike lanes? ”
But Strickland says there was not a bike lane in the location where the incident happened.
“Stay in the damn bike line… there was no bike lane,” they said.
Just who is in the right is a matter of dispute. Strickland contends they had a right to the road since there is no bike lane on that section of East Street or on the overpass. They also say Harris' horn made them jump through their skin.
“To a cyclist, coming up behind you and putting the horn on is not dissimilar to coming up behind you and firing a gun off, ” says Strickland.
Harris contends that the incident started before the video began. They say Strickland exited a bike lane and cut them off.
“I could have hit him. I could have hit this man, and then it would have been my fault to hit a bicycle that comes out in front of my vehicle,” Harris said.

Regardless, it highlights the continuing controversy over bike lanes laid down under the Mayor Bill Peduto administration. Critics like Harris have cited a lack of public input and contend they are under-used and often ignored by the cyclists themselves.
Sheehan: “This is an issue for you in the mayor's race, right?”
Harris: “What's the issue?”
Sheehan: “You don't like bike lanes.”
Harris: “No, it's not about not liking bike lanes. It is about – there have not been safety studies done or traffic studies done.”
While advocates like Strickland say people like Harris should learn to share the road.
“She should know how to interact with other fellow travelers on the roadways, so as to not cause them grief, to be respectful of them. They were disrespectful of me,” said Strickland.
‘Based on a True Story' is eye-catching, head-turning and ticket-worthy for many movie fans. For horror, this tagline alone and its message is especially enticing and ups the ante on all other movies playing that week in theaters. Quite simply: it sells. But what does ‘based on a true story' really mean? As movie-goers, how much can we hold such a movie accountable as being truthful towards the real persons and events it portrays?
Advertising that a movie is based in a true story goes back to 1899 with the short film Major Wilson's Last Stand. However, the first major horror genre Hollywood film to be inspired by real events was Rope in 1948. Directed by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock, Rope takes the story of a 14 year-old boy named Bobby Franks who was kidnapped and murdered by two students (named Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb) attending the University of Chicago in 1924. They believed that in their superior intellect, they would be able to pull off the perfect crime. Ultimately the two were arrested and sentenced to life plus 99 years in prison, each. The film cleans up the real story for 1940s audiences by replacing the teenage victim with a man roughly the same age as their murderers, along with other creative liberties.
It is without a doubt, that films like Rope and others that claim to be based on true events dramatize their plots for the sake of story. But how much is too much?
One former gawker.com writer aimed to find out in 2012, Cord Jefferson contacted the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). They write: “I asked for an explanation of what a movie must do to be able to sell itself as being based on a true story. “Is there a minimum percentage of truth that needs to be in the plot?” I asked. The MPAA's response: “The MPAA Advertising Administration does not determine whether a film is designated to be ‘based on true events'—that is the purview of the producer or distributor of the film.”
The first paranormal horror film with a plot based on truthful events came in the form of The Exorcist in 1973. We've talked about the alleged real events surrounding this story in depth, you can read more here. Based on a 1949 case of possession, William Blatty published a novel by the same name after learning about the possession while attending Georgetown University. Just how much of the story is based in fact is still debated today.
Many other paranormal horror films have since emerged having claimed the same truthfulness to their audiences. One of the most recent box office success the 2013 film, The Conjuring. The film grossed $318 million from a $20 million budget and broke the record for the biggest opening for an R-rated horror film. The story of the Perron family and the haunting they endure is solidified when the credits roll, showing real photos taken from the Perron family album. In a USA Today interview, the eldest of the Perron children said that the film has “many elements of truth to it, and some moments of fiction.”
The movie did not avoid controversy, however, and suffered a lawsuit when Norma Sutcliffe and Gerald Helfrich sued James Wan, and Warner Bros. Sutcliffe and Helfrich, the owners of the house which was used to film the movie, saying that their property has been continuously trespassed and even vandalized since the film's release. Both owners state that while they've owned the property between 1987 and 2012, they have lived “in peace” – implying there have been no real paranormal occurrences during that time.
The highly successful film has produced spin-offs and sequels, including The Conjuring 2 (2013) and Annabelle (2014), both of which also claim to be ‘based on true events'. Annabelle 2 is in theaters 2017. Another spin-off titled The Nun is currently in the works, though whether or not it will be based on a true story is yet to be seen.
Prior to The Conjuring franchise, there was The Haunting in Connecticut in 2009. It, too, claimed to be based on a true story. However, paranormal researcher and skeptic Ray Garton wrote in regards to the film, “I suspect the movie will begin with the words: ‘Based on a true story.' Be warned: Just about anything that begins with any variation of this phrase is trying a little too hard to convince you of something that probably isn't true.”
And while ‘based on a true story' is the most used version of the tagline, there is also its sister: ‘loosely based on…' This tagline is a watered-down version of the former. It is easier to swallow if one is keen on investigating. However, for most movie-goers, there's just enough enticement in the one-sentence promise to purchase that movie ticket. One blogger for TVTropes.org writes: “Very Loosely Based On A True Story often occurs because of Executive Meddling, especially if some of the characters are based on living persons who might sue them if the depiction is too unsympathetic. Another reason can be to make characters less three-dimensional so as not to confuse the viewers…”
So the next time you walk by the latest horror movie poster and read that very cleverly placed ‘Based on a True Story' line, take it with a grain of salt. While much of a story's plot might stem from real events and people, know that a lot of Hollywood storytelling relies on the dramatization of facts and details. That's not to say no one should watch these movies, in fact, many have proven themselves to be box office and critical successes. Just be aware that truth is always subject to change in the entertainment industry – ‘truth' Hollywood can pull and play with it like a piece of putty.

This was pretty funny, right up to the moment where (Democratic) Cuyahoga County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora threatened reporter Henry Gomez's wife.
The background is as follows: Dimora is being investigated as part of a corruption probe* – yes, I know, corruption in Cuyahoga county; how shocking – and Dimora is a bit upset about the way Gomez (and their paper the Plain Dealer) is covering the investigation. So Dimora ups and accuses Gomez and their paper of not reporting a particular detail of the investigation: to wit, that Ohio Auditor (and Republican candidate for Lt. Governor) Mary Taylor had not released two years' worth of audits. Only problem is, this had been reported – including a quote from, guess who? that is right, Jim Dimora – and when Gomez told Dimora about this, Dimora called Gomez a liar.
So far, so funny. Now here's the unfunny bit:
Dimora then asks about Gomez's wife. “She's a school teacher, isn't she? How did they get their job? Should we call, should we look at their personnel file? Did they have a reference letter from anybody?” “Leave my wife out of it, Jimmy,” Gomez responds.
You don't talk like that when you're an elected official. Even if you're an elected official of the current ruling party of Ohio. Especially if you're an elected official of the current ruling party of Ohio, in fact. I don't care how much pressure a politician feels from a brewing scandal, either, or how hostile they think that a paper is being. Call the paper a rag and suggest that the reporter is a hack and a shill? Go for it – but you don't make it personal. Jim Dimora made it personal.

PS: Anybody pushes back on this; remember, it's not my fault that a Democratic county commissioner was so stupid, lazy, and arrogant as to make comments like this on camera. But – particularly if you're from Ohio – it may be yours.
Have a nice day!

Iowa and New Hampshire had their turns in the spotlight, and Nevada comes this Saturday. And a week after that, my state, South Carolina, will host its own Democratic primary. Compared to those first two states, ours is highly diverse. Battle ground, trial phase—call it what you will—South Carolina, once a crucible of the civil rights movement and Barack Obama's surge, can help vet the candidate best aligned with the black community.
Bernie Sanders is not that candidate—not next to Hillary Clinton. From their bouts with the president to the laws they contested to the company they keep, Sanders raises alarm bells for Obama supporters, especially those from the African-American community.
Back in 2012, while still a proud Independent, Sanders took a page from the Republican playbook and called for a primary challenge to Obama's presidency. Their aim: to contrast “a progressive agenda as opposed to what Obama is doing,” as if to say affordable health care and safe cities are not “progressive” enough goals. The Democrats I know would disagree.
That anti-Obama jab followed an earlier resistance to the Affordable Care Act, now considered President Obama's greatest legacy. Back in 2009, coming from the far left wing, Sanders held out on voting “yes,” hoping instead for an impossible ideal. Over 200,000 South Carolinians now have quality, affordable health insurance through Obamacare. If Sanders fulfills their campaign promise and starts those talks from a blank slate, then they risk undoing years of progress.
Improving health care matters greatly to our community. It's no secret that African Americans die earlier than whites and suffer in larger numbers from diseases like diabetes and heart disease. We also die twice as often from gun violence. In Charleston County alone, blacks accounted for 29 percent of the population in 2014 but claimed 78 percent of gun violence deaths. We demand equality where our lives are at stake, and on that note Sanders has a mixed record on gun safety, having opposed reforms that Obama now pushes.
The Vermont senator once voted for legislation that allowed the Charleston shooter to buy a gun despite a clerical error—the now-infamous “Charleston Loophole.” More recently, they voted down legislation meant to shield gun makers from victim lawsuits. When President Obama last month refused to back “any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform,” they may well have been referring to Sanders.
In what perhaps struck the candidate as an act of solidarity, Sanders also chose Cornel West as liaison to South Carolina's black voters. As The Washington Post puts it, West serves as Sanders's “controversial traveling companion” and “has been highly critical of President Obama.” That's an understatement. Cornel West hates President Obama. They once called the president “a brown-faced Clinton,” “a Rockefeller Republican in blackface,” and a “counterfeit” progressive.
My own father, Cleveland Sellers, was a real civil rights-era activist, as were Jesse Jackson and Rev. Joseph A. Darby. All of them are alive and well with deep South Carolina roots and could have been surrogates for Sen. Sanders. So of all the black leaders Sanders could have chosen, why West? West is a scholar, sure, but their views are extreme, and they clash with much of the pro-Obama black community.
Bernie Sanders means well, and their calls for income equality rightly resonate with Democratic voters. But certain issues—gun violence and health care among them—and certain viewpoints—Cornel West's not among them—appeal specifically to most African Americans. My vote goes to someone who supports President Obama and intends to wholly and ambitiously build on their legacy. That someone is not Bernie Sanders.
MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India has refused to extend the deadline for upgrading security on credit card swipe machines and has ordered banks to compensate cardholders in seven days if any fraud occurs on non-compliant terminals.If the bank fails to refund the disputed amount in seven days, it has to compensate the cardholder with a penalty of Rs 100 per day until the date of payment. At present, dispute resolution is a cumbersome process and takes several weeks in case of credit card frauds Banks see the new directive as indicative of the central bank's seriousness on card security. After a rise in credit card frauds, the RBI had asked banks to add security features including an electronic chip and a secret PIN which the cardholder is required to punch in the terminal to authenticate payment. This feature was to come in force from July 1. But banks were behind schedule in both issuing chip cards and in upgrading terminals to meet the new security standards.Since the entire industry was behind schedule, the RBI was forced to extend the deadline. Banks were required to get credit card swipe machines upgraded by September-end and have all the cards upgraded by November. But a few days ahead of the September deadline, banks have again said that they are not ready.“Various banks have approached us, seeking further extension of the timeline of September 30, 2013 for complying with the task of securing the technology infrastructure,” the central bank said in a statement.Pointing out that banks were told that there would be no further extensions, the RBI said, “It has been decided not to grant any further extension of time. Accordingly, banks not complying with the requirements shall compensate loss, if any, incurred by the cardholder using card at POS terminals not adhering to the mandated standards.”There are usually two banks in every credit card transaction. One that issued the credit card and the other that has installed the swipe machine. The RBI has said that the card issuing bank should ascertain in three days whether the fraud has taken in a non-compliant machine and within seven days refund the money to the cardholder. The card issuing bank will in turn recover the money from the bank which has installed the swipe machine.

Six months after Russia's forceful annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, the peninsula's 250,000 Tatars are feeling the heat.
Moscow initially tried to woo and co-opt Crimea's Tatar community. But when that effort fell flat, the Kremlin pivoted to its default setting -- the tried and true application of force and fear.
Does the campaign against the Crimean Tatars risk galvanizing -- and potentially radicalizing -- Russia's 5-million-strong Tatar community and turning the country's largest ethnic minority into opponents of the regime?
On the latest "Power Vertical Podcast," we take a look at the Kremlin's campaign against the Crimean Tatars and what it portends. Joining me are Rim Gilfanov, director of RFE/RL's Tatar-Bashkir Service; Merkhat Sharipzhan, a senior correspondent and analyst for RFE/RL's Central Newsroom; and Mark Galeotti, a professor at New York University, an expert on Russia's security services, and author of the blog "In Moscow's Shadows."
Also on the podcast, we discuss the Vladimir Putin personality cult, which was on full display for the Kremlin leader's 62nd birthday.

Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard and Samsung's Gear VR are all trying to get developers excited about building immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences. But as VR is capturing our imaginations, developers are left to wonder whether this new world will once again be dominated by competing and incompatible platforms, just the way mobile and desktop computing have been for so long.
Some developers think they've found a solution to this problem. “Remember the old ‘write once, run anywhere' promise,” asked Google employee and VR enthusiast Boris Smus in a blog post this week, adding: “The web is the closest thing we have to fulfilling it.” Instead of building native apps that just work on one platform or even just one single VR headset, developers could build their VR experiences in HTML, and simply have them run in a browser.

This idea, commonly known as WebVR, is championed by a variety of developers and organizations, with one big proponent being Mozilla. The browser maker launched its own MozVR website for web-based VR experiences last year, and added VR support to the nightly (pre-alpha) builds of Firefox last month. There are also efforts to bring VR to Chrome, and Google launched a website highlighting VR Chrome experiments when it unveiled its own DIY Cardboard VR viewer last year.
However, so far, these efforts aren't compatible. “The latest VR wave has barely begun and already the web VR world is fragmented,” wrote Smus, adding: “Case in point, vr.chromeexperiments.com don't work on Oculus, and mozvr.com demos don't work in Cardboard.” Developers can now either wait until Google, Mozilla, Oculus and others agree on a common standard — or simply get their own cross-platform approach ready.
That's exactly what Smus did this week by launching what they call “responsive WebVR.” The idea: Make HTML-based VR work across headsets, and even without any headset at all. Their inspiration? Responsive web design that automatically detects whether a user accesses a site with a desktop or a mobile browser, and optimizes the experience accordingly:
“Responsive web design promises content which automatically adapts to your viewing environment by using fluid layouts, flexible images, proportional grids; a cocktail of modern web technologies. Similarly, WebVR experiences need to work even without VR hardware.”
Smus' WebVR boilerplate open source project allows developers to create HTML-based VR experiences that work with both Oculus Rift and Google Cardboard, as well as with no VR headset at all, using a phone's gyroscope to allow users to tilt the display to explore worlds. For now, it still requires developers to download a special build of Chrome, but developers should feel encouraged by the promise of cross-platform capabilities — and the potential of web-based experiences that work in an ordinary desktop or mobile browser as well as a VR headset is pretty exciting.
Flowers are placed in front of the Supreme Court on Feb. 14 in Washington to honor Justice Antonin Scalia, who died at age 79. Their death has triggered a political showdown over their succession in the run-up to the presidential election. (Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)
Eminent Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously described their fellow judges as “nine scorpions in a bottle,” but now they are reduced to eight. Justice Antonin Scalia's passing had hardly been made public when Republicans began proclaiming that President Obama should not appoint the late justice's successor. President Obama countered that they would perform their constitutional duty and nominate a successor to Scalia, adding, “Your job doesn't stop until you are voted out or until your term expires.”
The historical record supports that position: 14 presidents have appointed 21 justices during presidential election years. A half-dozen presidents, classic lame ducks, filled Supreme Court seats even though their successors had been elected.
These six lame duck presidents appointed Supreme Court justices – before their successors took office
President Benjamin Harrison had been defeated in their 1892 reelection bid by former president Grover Cleveland, for example, when Associate Justice Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar died in office in January 1893. At that time, and until 1937 (and the 20th amendment), presidents were inaugurated in March, not January. While running for reelection, Harrison had appointed their third justice the previous July; they made a fourth nomination to the high court, despite their dwindling White House tenure. But Republican Harrison bowed to partisan realities by nominating their Democratic friend, Howell Jackson.
[Who should replace Scalia? No one. Here's why eight is enough.]
The Senate was soon to change hands from Republican to Democratic control, and Harrison's bipartisan gambit worked: The Senate unanimously approved Jackson one month before Cleveland's inauguration.
This is why Judge Sri Srinivasan of the D.C. Circuit is receiving so much attention as a potential nominee to the nation's highest tribunal. They served their judicial clerkships for Reagan appointees and moderate conservatives, 4th Circuit Court Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III and Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, suggesting that they may have bipartisan appeal. They were born in India and grew up in Kansas, a compelling story of the American dream — and having the first Indian American justice replace the first Italian American on the Supreme Court would maintain a historic symmetry.
Further, the fact that Srinivasan is Hindu would add religious diversity to a bench populated solely by Catholic or Jewish justices for the past six years, and would follow a long presidential tradition of placing religious minorities on the Supreme Court long before that religion was represented in high elected office. Srinivasan more than meets the standard of exceptional merit, with their Stanford degrees and professional experience. And the Republican-controlled Senate approved them unanimously when Obama nominated them for the D.C. Circuit, a Supreme Court proving ground, in 2013.
[Should this Senate fill Justice Scalia's seat? Beware the ‘argle-bargle.']
Although Benjamin Harrison was the most recent lame duck to place a justice on the Supreme Court, five other presidents (Hayes, Tyler, Van Buren, Jackson and Adams) did so as well. All but Jackson, who named a justice on the last full day of their two terms, had been defeated or had withdrawn from the election. Adams's last-minute appointment of their Secretary of State John Marshall to chief justice, a parting Federalist slap at the Jeffersonians, makes today's partisan rows look tame by comparison. “That gloomy malignity,” as Thomas Jefferson inaccurately described Marshall, would preside over the court for 34 years, long after the Federalist Party faded from the scene. The Supreme Court labels them the “Great Chief Justice” for their masterful leadership and foundational interpretations of the Constitution.
One-third of U.S. presidents appointed Supreme Court justices during election years
Aside from genuine lame ducks, one-third of U.S. presidents appointed justices during presidential election years. A handful were, like Obama, not running for reelection. George Washington, who established precedents that shape the office to this day, declined to run for a third term, but they added an associate justice and a chief justice during the election year of 1796.
Jackson and Cleveland followed the two-term tradition, and each appointed two members of the Supreme Court in the election year before leaving office. Like Obama, Jackson faced an obstinate Senate, which had postponed a vote on their nominee Roger Taney for an associate justice position early in 1835. Old Hickory renominated Taney nearly a year later, this time to chief justice, upon the death of John Marshall. Taney, the Court's first Catholic, assumed their seat just seven months before the 1836 presidential election.
Three presidents who appointed Supreme Court justices in an election year (Hoover, Taft and B. Harrison) were running for reelection but ultimately lost. If Hoover hadn't replaced retiring Justice Holmes in February 1932, the court might have been denied the intellectual services of Benjamin Cardozo, by all accounts a stellar justice. Hoover faced a closely divided Senate, but Cardozo was so universally admired that their confirmation was unanimous.
[Here's how an Obama Supreme Court nominee could win confirmation]
William Howard Taft, who would lose their 1912 reelection campaign, achieved the position they most coveted, chief justice of the United States, when appointed to the high court by Warren Harding in 1921. In an interesting twist, Taft served on the Supreme Court with the associate justice, Mahlon Pitney, whom they had appointed in their last year before leaving the White House.
Franklin Roosevelt and four other presidents (Nixon, Eisenhower, Wilson, Cleveland and Jefferson) placed justices on the Supreme Court during election years that led them to a second term. Ike faced an opening just three weeks before the 1956 election when Justice Sherman Minton left the bench in ill health. Looking for support from the electoral-vote rich Northeast, Eisenhower immediately selected William Brennan, a New Jersey Catholic, in a recess appointment. Catholics, a key component of the FDR's New Deal coalition, were also represented in FDR's 1940 election-year nomination of Frank Murphy to fill the seat of deceased Catholic justice Pierce Butler.
Nixon's two appointments in 1972 of William Rehnquist and Lewis Powell carried out their campaign promise to reshape the court to counter the liberal Warren-era decisions, and contributed to their landslide victory over George McGovern. Nixon couldn't have predicted that a mere two years later, their reshaped bench would unanimously rule against them in the Watergate tapes case, with only Rehnquist recusing himself.
Two other presidents (Lincoln and Grant) named Supreme Court members after they had been reelected but before their second inauguration. When Roger Taney died in late 1864, after 32 years on the bench, Lincoln happily replaced the Jacksonian chief justice with their Republican Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase.
The founding fathers debated how Supreme Court justices should be appointed
Justice Scalia's 30-year tenure confirms President Gerald Ford's observation that “few appointments a president makes can have as much impact on the future of the country as those to the Supreme Court.” That truism, even more apposite now when the Court is evenly split on the most contentious political issues of the day, explains why the Founding Fathers spent so much time debating the process of selecting justices.
[When was the last Supreme Court nomination in which stakes were this high? Maybe never.]
Nearly silent on judicial qualifications, the founders gave considerable thought at Philadelphia's 1787 constitutional convention to the best method of choosing them. The delegates initially considered appointment of federal judges by the national legislature. Pennsylvania's James Wilson, a future member of the Court, opposed the proposal, arguing that “[i]ntrigue, partiality, and concealment” resulted from judicial appointments by legislatures.
Future president James Madison, often called the “Father of the Constitution,” added that members of the legislature “were not judges of the requisite qualifications” for jurists. Wilson thought that the newly created office of the president should have sole authority to choose judges, but John Rutledge of South Carolina thought that plan too monarchical.
As so frequently happened at the convention, perhaps because it operated in secret, the delegates reached a compromise, eventually settling on nomination to the Supreme Court by the president, with appointment contingent on the Senate's prerogative to advise and consent.
While the exact nature of that prerogative has been endlessly debated, the original intent of the Constitution's framers, which the late Justice Scalia squarely embraced, was to produce qualified Supreme Court justices by checking and balancing the “ambitions” inherent in the chief executive and Congress's upper house. It was not to allow the voter (even the white, male, landed-gentry electorate of that era) a direct role.
Four cases that could re-shape the country will be heard when the Supreme Court meets this term without Justice Antonin Scalia. Scalia consistently expressed conservative views when reviewing court cases. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)

Rich, young women are kicking butt.
Wealthy Millennial women are more likely to make at least as much -- if not more -- than their husbands. They're also more likely to take the big decisions on household finances and investments, according to a new report from U.S. Trust that surveyed high and ultra-high net worth individuals, defined as those with at least $3 million in investable assets.
The report found that 30% of these wealthy Millennial women were the primary income earners, and another 21% contributed the same amount as their partners. That's compared to just 11% of Gen X women who made more than their husbands, 15% of Baby Boomer women and 4% who are 70 years old or older. The percentage of equal earners remained relatively similar across all four generations.

Not only are the high net worth Millennial women earning more than women in other generations, but they're also making more financial decisions than older women. In fact, in a major generational shift, they're making more financial decisions than their husbands.
For Millennial women, 31% are the dominant decision-makers when it comes to household finances, compared to 28% of men, just 11% of Gen X women, 9% of Boomer ladies and 1% of what the report calls "mature" females. The breakdowns, and the vast shift from generation to generation, are nearly identical when it comes to investment decisions.
Younger wealthy women are also seeing a great change when it comes to childcare. The report found that while women across the board still act as the primary caregivers for children, Millennial men are taking on a far greater share of the responsibility than men of older generations.
About 25% of Millennial men surveyed said they are the primary caretakers to children in their household. Only 7% of Gen X men, 3% of Baby Boomers and 4% of mature men said the same.
Because younger women have greater earning and decision-making power among this wealth segment, U.S. Trust is seeing more females interested in planning and investing wealth, according to Chris Heilmann, chief fiduciary executive at the bank.
"We tell our employees that if you have clients who are married couples and you're primarily talking to the husband, you have to change that," they said.
The report is based on a national survey of 640 high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth adults, 16% of whom identified as Millennials.
In this series, I will compare Bobby Jindal's pledges as a candidate in 2007 with their record in the Governor's office. I begin with the centerpiece of Jindal's 2007 campaign, ethics reform.
In 2007, when they kicked off their second and, ultimately, first successful campaign for governor, U.S. Rep. Bobby Jindal talked frequently about the urgent and pressing need to completely transform state ethics laws. Some legislators were actually lobbyists, they suggested, a clear conflict of interest. Some used campaign contributions to pay salaries for their spouses and children. The Ruth's Chris dinners may have always seemed like a traditional perk of the job, but it also perfectly symbolized the problem.
Per capita, more public officials from Louisiana have been convicted of a crime than from anywhere else in the country, except, of course, Mississippi. It wasn't too difficult to work up a crowd by excoriating lawmakers for spending more time eating fancy steak dinners, usually paid for by lobbyists, than on working for the people they were elected to represent. They were all a bunch of fat cats. They became rich off of the public dime. Or so the story was told. Bobby Jindal published detailed, multi-pronged reports on how, exactly, they would usher in a “gold standard” for ethics; it became the centerpiece of their campaign.
In August 2007, Jindal released a bizarre, slapstick television commercial titled “They Can't Stop Corruption,” lampooning their two Democratic opponents, Foster Campbell and Walter Boasso, as some sort of deranged clowns whose primary talent involves eating gobs of money from the steps of the capitol.
It took me nearly an hour to finally locate this video. Believe it or not, there are now countless other stories, pictures, and videos that pop up when you search the web for “Bobby Jindal clown,” “Bobby Jindal clown car,” and “Bobby Jindal clown commercial.” The governor has also completely scrubbed the commercial from both their website and their YouTube account, which, incidentally, still includes other videos from 2007. I finally found this ad after scouring archive.org for 8-year-old caches of bobbyjindal.com. Suffice it to say, it has been scrubbed for a reason.
In fairness, both Foster Campbell and Walter Boasso are, in fact, millionaires. But even back then, before they published their first book, so was Bobby Jindal. The commercial was not a populist attack against the wealthy, though; it was a commentary about the profligate, out-of-control spending of limousine liberal legislators and the legacy of Edwin Edwards, and it fit perfectly with Jindal's message about ethics reform. It was also a dog whistle, an inverted facsimile of a minstril show: painted faces in suits, goofy and dumb smiles, stilted movements, comedic music that recalls the 1920s.
Seven and a half years later, as Jindal ramps up their bid for the Presidency, we should ask: How, exactly, did Bobby Jindal reform ethics laws?
Here are the “five pillars” of their plan:
The very first pillar of Bobby Jindal's plan, numero uno, is that you cannot be both a lobbyist and a legislator at the same time. That seems obvious and uncontroversial, but Jindal takes it a step further. “This will extend to other business relationships that may be seen as gray areas,” Jindal writes. For example, if you're a paid consultant for an industry that is being sued by a state agency or another political subdivision, you can't use your power as a legislator to introduce changes in the law that would retroactively immunize the industry from litigation.
That is, unless you're Republican State Senator Robert Adley. Quoting from Tyler Bridges's report in The Lens titled “Oil and gas interests have no better friend in Baton Rouge than combative Sen. Adley” (bold mine):
In criticizing the lawsuit, Jindal also argued that the flood authority didn't have the right to file it. But rather than let a court resolve the dispute, the governor, Adley said, had aides ask them to use their political muscle to snuff out the litigation in Baton Rouge, where the oil and gas business has a reputation for getting its way.
Here's the problem (bold mine):
… as their critics note, Adley is steeped in the oil and gas business. They owned Pelican Gas Management from 1992 until they sold the business in 2012. The company managed natural gas supplies for small towns around the state through contracts with the Louisiana Municipal Gas Authority. In 2003, an Associated Press article questioned whether the gas authority awarded them the no-bid contracts thanks to their political office and influence — a suggestion they denied. The business was lucrative. In 2002, the AP reported, they earned $259,000 from Pelican. Adley's latest financial disclosure report shows that in 2012 they and their wife each earned at least $100,000, the highest reportable figure. …. They now consult for gas companies, Adley said. …. “For nine months of the year, they are the chief executive officer of a gas company,” said Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, the retired U.S. Army commander who led troops into New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. “For three months [during the legislative session], they represent the industry they are in,” said Honore; their Green Army, a nonprofit environmental group, is fighting Adley's legislative effort.
“Pillar Two,” Jindal writes. “Legislators will have to give full financial disclosure.”
This also sounds obvious and uncontroversial, but it's based on a fundamentally flawed assumption and a misguided expectation: Ostensibly, Jindal's ethics reform agenda was about rooting out criminality and corruption. The problem is: No one ever purposefully discloses a bribe. Sure, it's now nice to know how much, exactly, elected officials have spent on gas, groceries, and food, and now, we can finally rank restaurants by how much each has received from campaign and PAC funds.
Don't get me wrong though: Transparency is important, and the Internet now allows anyone the ability to comb through trillions of pages of public records. At its best, disclosure laws demand accountability and ensure that elected officials realize that they are being constantly scrutinized by the media.
That's not what has happened in Bobby Jindal's Louisiana, however. The second pillar, it turns out, is only credible if the first pillar is actually enforced. Otherwise, it's just empty rhetoric, and no one takes you seriously.
I'm a big fan of Pillar Three. I think it's my favorite part of the 2007 Jindal campaign platform. “You cannot serve in the government and do business with the government at the same time,” Jindal writes. For example, if you own a law firm that represents the government in pending litigation, you cannot also collect a paycheck as the governor's executive counsel. That's double-dipping. It would appear as if you may have used your access in the Governor's Office to steer lucrative legal work to your private practice. Thankfully, Jindal's attorney realized this a few weeks before the inauguration ceremonies.
Faircloth resigned a year and a half later, ran for the Louisiana State Supreme Court (with the Governor's full support), lost, and then returned to private practice.
You'll never believe what he's doing now. Quoting from Melinda Deslatte (bold mine):
A law firm run by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's former executive counsel has received more than $1.1 million in no-bid contract work from Jindal appointees and state agencies since leaving the governor's office and is becoming a fixture in high-profile legal battles for the Republican administration. …. Faircloth returned to private practice with their new law firm, and within three months of the election loss, they were hired in January 2010 to represent the Louisiana Tax Commission, led by Jindal appointees. They canceled the legal services contract a few months later, after questions were raised about whether they had waited enough time under state law to do the work. The governor's executive counsel is among those public employees prohibited from entering into state contracts for a year after leaving the job under Louisiana's ethics laws. Faircloth was later fined $1,000 by the Board of Ethics for violating the law, but the fine was suspended as long as they remained in compliance with ethics laws.
That's right: Bobby Jindal's own lawyer was fined for violating ethics laws.
Pillars Four and Five aren't policy prescriptions; they're just hackneyed rhetoric. But Jindal promised more than the five pillars.
Bobby Jindal may claim that they were able to check off these things from their list, but unfortunately, their version of ethics reform has proven to be completely ineffectual and almost entirely unenforceable. Lobbyists still freely roam the halls and the back corridors of the capitol. Legislators still make fortunes “working” for the very companies they were elected to regulate. Millions of dollars in state legal work somehow found its way to a tiny law office in Alexandria a couple of years after its founder and owner resigned as the Governor's attorney.
For many, that may seem like business as usual in a state like Louisiana. Ethics reform, though, should not just be about tracing interconnected webs of money between industry lobbyists and lawmakers. Much more importantly, ethics reform should be focused on transparency in decision-making. Both the media and the public have a fundamental right to access, analyze, and, yes, criticize, agency and administrative reports on education, tax, and health care policy and spending. On issues that do not affect state, national, or even local security and law enforcement, citizens should be able to properly scrutinize and vet the mega-million dollar reports for which they pay. It is critical to an informed and functioning democracy, and it is absolutely necessary that a vibrant press has the resources required to accurately report the news.
While Bobby Jindal set about enacting a series of new requirements on the legislature, they also successfully snuck in language that would make their office the least transparent in contemporary history, rebranding and massively expanding the old “governor's exemption” into the much more nebulous and far-reaching “deliberative process exemption,” which frequently prevents any and all records that the governor ever looked at from being disclosed (particularly when the documents requested concern policies the governor is “deliberating,” which can take weeks, months, even years, depending on the issue). It's an arbitrary and capricious law, and it provides enormous personal power to the governor over the media and their colleagues in the legislature.
A few years ago, my friend Zack Kopplin and I had to sue the Louisiana Department of Education to provide records pertaining to the school voucher program; the case is still ongoing. The Advocate had to sue the state merely to learn the names of those who were considered as LSU's next president. Last week, the state refused to provide documents outlining potential cuts to health care. And all of these denials have one thing in common: They all invoked the newly-created “deliberative process” exemption, a legal neologism borrowed from the federal rules of discovery, in order to create a new, artificial, and expansive subspecies of “confidential” records. Anything that the Governor has or could look at falls under the exception.
This, I'd argue, is the polar opposite of an ethical, open, and transparent government. It resembles totalitarianism, a disdain for the media. It undermines democracy.
A few years ago, in a statement for an LSU Law review article, a local legislator put it perfectly (bold mine). “The bill,” they said, “would result in Louisiana being more closed than a Communist state like Cuba. The bill (he said), would ‘take the state of Louisiana from sunshine to moonshine.'”
The legislator's name: Robert Adley.
Wikimedia Commons For several years now, net migration from Mexico has fallen to zero.
What's going on?
Gary Becker, a Nobel Prize-winning University of Chicago economist, writes that it's got little to do with the U.S.
Rather, it's mostly thanks to Mexico and it's growing middle class, as expressed in lower birth rates and rising earnings:
One important cause is the sharp decline in Mexican birth rates during the past couple of decades. Not long ago Mexico was a country with high birth rates that produced many young adults who had trouble finding jobs. Now, the Mexican total fertility rate (TFR)- the number of children born to a typical woman over their lifetime- has plummeted to about 2.25. This rate is only a little above the population replacement rate of 2.1. Unlike in the past, the number of young people in Mexico will no longer be growing rapidly over time, so that the numbers looking for work in the Mexican labor market will be on the decline.
The push from Mexico has also diminished because its economy has been growing at a good clip during the past 9 years. Excluding the large drop in 2009, the growth rate in real GDP has been over 4% per year. Mexico's growth rate after 2009 considerably exceeds the American rate of under 2%, which is remarkable since about 80% of all Mexican exports go to the depressed American economy. One consequence is that the gap between earnings in Mexico and the United States is narrowing. This clearly reduces the demand to immigrate to America, especially under the difficult circumstances illegal immigrants face.
While a strong U.S. recovery could begin to restart migration inflows, Mexico will grow, no matter what likely rendering the immigration debate academic, Becker says:
the highly controversial American political issue of what to do about illegal immigration should become much less important in the future.
Perhaps we should have seen this coming: it's much easier for Congress to discuss something when there's not as much at stake.
At this point in the interrogation, Petr's tale shifted suddenly from a narrative of dutiful soldiership to one of wild adventurism. With another soldier from the Ninth Brigade, they said, they ran away from their temporary base in the middle of the night and walked across the border. They wanted to join the rebel militia, which they heard was paying 150,000 rubles a month, or roughly $4,000 at the time. After walking for two days through the forest, they swam across a river and were eventually captured by a group of rebel fighters. At their base in the town of Novosvitlivka, the rebels took them into their ranks. Petr said they gave them an ammunition vest, a Kalashnikov rifle and some grenades. They drove off in a Soviet-made Lada with three militants; their friend took off in another direction in a BMW. Before long, the car Petr was riding in was stopped by Ukrainian soldiers, who took everyone into custody. After questioning, they said, “they gave me something to eat and cigarettes.” The video ended abruptly, the beam of a flashlight casting a weak, spectral light on Petr's face.
The officers immediately called their superiors, who ordered them to stay the night in Novouzensk and return to base the next day. Before they left, they gave Sergey some instructions: Don't go anywhere. Don't ask for help from anyone. “We'll get them back ourselves,” one officer told him, promising a prisoner exchange with the Ukrainians. Nazira began to cry.
Petr's enlistment in the Russian Army roughly coincided with the beginning of the war in Ukraine, more than 600 miles from where their brigade was based. The conflict grew out of the disorder and fear that arose in Ukraine last spring after protests pushed the president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, from power. Many in the Russian-­speaking east did not trust the new leaders in Kiev, and they formed militias, seizing administrative and police buildings and then waging open warfare against Ukrainian forces when they arrived. They were aided by an opaque assortment of Russian agents and volunteer fighters, inspired by the relative ease with which Russia took over the Crimean peninsula, another Ukrainian region with a pro-Russian majority. Uprisings in Donetsk and Luhansk, the two provinces that make up Ukraine's easternmost tip, began not long afterward. From the beginning, the Kremlin denied that it was stoking the conflict in the Donbass, as the region is often called. Yet by this point in the summer, it could no longer hide the fact that Russian money, weapons and quite likely fighters were flowing across the border.
Anna recalls that Petr's first few weeks of service were uneventful, even idle. “We slack off,” they told them “We don't do all that much.” But then, near the end of June, Petr and the rest of the soldiers in the brigade were dispatched to the Rostov region for military exercises. As Anna remembers it, Petr's commanders first told them it would be for a week, maybe two. After a month went by, Petr told Anna that they would be back by September. The last time they spoke was the end of July. “You rarely call,” Anna told him. “I've already grown unaccustomed to your voice.” “More often isn't possible,” they said. “Wait for me. I'll come back soon.” In that call, they said something about the Donbass, the contested region in eastern Ukraine. Petr and their fellow soldiers were stationed either there or near there on the Russian side of the border — they couldn't remember exactly.
This last call came at a moment when the war was shifting to a new phase — and as a result, Russia, too, was changing its approach to the conflict. In the early days of the war in April and May, rebel forces routed the Ukrainian Army and the volunteer battalions fighting alongside it in humiliating battles, seizing ever greater swaths of territory. For much of the spring and summer, Russia's involvement, at least in a strictly military sense, was limited to supplying weapons and equipment to the rebels; to the extent that Russian soldiers were on the ground in the east, they tended to be instructors or technical specialists. But as the war — or what the new Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, who was elected in May, referred to as an “antiterrorist operation” — dragged on, the Ukrainian side began to reverse the momentum. By the beginning of August, the government in Kiev had recaptured 75 percent of the territory once controlled by the rebels. Its often indiscriminate artillery campaign had shattered Luhansk, a city whose prewar population was nearly 450,000, leaving it without electricity and on the verge of capture by pro-Kiev militias. Donetsk, the largest city in the rebel-held east and the separatists' political capital, seemed poised to fall within weeks, if not days.
If the rebels were defeated, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would lose their leverage in Ukraine. They needed the separatists to hang on, almost certainly not because they wanted to annex the land they controlled but because it was advantageous for the conflict to remain unresolved, an instrument that Russia could use to complicate Ukrainian politics for years to come. Putin warned of “consequences” if Kiev pressed its campaign. They kept saying there could be no military solution, a declaration made not for any humanistic reason but because they didn't want their proxy force to suffer a battlefield defeat before they could extract a political victory.
In August, days after Petr's disappearance, separatist forces began a counteroffensive against the Ukrainian Army. But mounting evidence suggests that the decisive role in this attack was played by Russian military units, which for the first time in the war were directly participating in battles inside Ukraine. For Russian officials and the country's state-run media, the direct involvement of Russian soldiers in the war — and especially the fact that dozens, maybe hundreds, were killed in the fighting — was a taboo subject, ignored or denied by all levels of the state bureaucracy. But the difference on the battlefield was palpable. Ukrainian forces could hope, with just a bit more time, to defeat a rebel insurgency, but they had no chance against the Russian Army and its weaponry. The West was not going to come to Poroshenko's rescue, making clear that any further efforts by Kiev to keep the fight going would risk total defeat. Days after the counteroffensive began, Poroshenko went to Minsk, Belarus, where they agreed to a cease-fire that ceded wide authority to the rebels, in effect creating a frozen conflict zone in eastern Ukraine propped up by Russia.
Adam Wren, a contributing editor at Indianapolis Monthly, writes about Indiana politics.
With the black marble of the Indiana House of Representatives behind him, Gov. Mike Pence in January trumpeted a laundry list of accomplishments achieved in the first half of their first term: Two balanced budgets. A falling unemployment rate. More than 100,000 new jobs created. It seemed the predicate for a potential 2016 run.
Basking in the glow of the moment, Pence dropped their customary aw-shucks Hoosier persona and let themselves boast: “Tonight, there are 49 other governors across this country who wish they could be me!”
Story Continued Below
Maybe then. Not anymore.
Not three short months later, amid the biggest crisis of their political life, that line rings comical.
At least three of those 49 governors Pence taunted—from Connecticut, New York, Washington and counting—have banned nonessential government travel from their states to Indiana in just the six days since Pence signed Senate Bill 101, the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act, in a behind-closed-doors ceremony March 26. Meanwhile, another of the 49, Arkansas Republican Asa Hutchinson, is expected to sign a similar religious freedom bill on Wednesday—joining Pence in offering the opening salvo in a new front of the culture wars.
But Pence is in trouble, because there is already collateral damage.
At least 10 national conventions are threatening to pull out of commitments to meeting in Indianapolis, according to city tourism officials, who have spent late nights talking down convention organizers in an attempt to keep a grip on the industry that brings in $4.4 billion annually and supports 75,000 jobs. Comedian Nick Offerman and indie band Wilco scuttled upcoming engagements here. Even NASCAR, not known for leftie or social-justice bona fides, expressed disappointment in the legislation.
And just days before the NCAA Final Four Championship is set to tip off, a different kind of March Madness has settled over the city. NCAA President Mark Emmert expressed doubts about maintaining its Indianapolis headquarters—a short walk from the Statehouse.
In a hastily called news conference on Tuesday, Pence—usually keen on playing the happy warrior in public—looked wan and defeated, though their hair was still shaped into its perfect and immoveable silver part. At some turns, in a dulcet tone, Pence employed a humble tack, suggesting the law needed “a fix” and admitting that their defensive performance in a Sunday appearance with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's “This Week” likely made things worse (“I could have handled that better,” Pence told reporters). At others, they defended the religious freedom bill, criticizing press coverage of it as “reckless” and “sloppy,” and said they harbored no regrets in signing it.
“It's been a tough week here in the Hoosier State, but we're going to move forward,” Pence assured state and national media who had gathered at the Indiana State Library, an unconventional choice for a news conference but a sop to the national interest in the roiling imbroglio. Pence's regular briefing area wasn't large enough to accommodate reporters who had descended on the city. (Even Olympic diver Greg Louganis, in town to promote a new book with the mother of Ryan White, the Kokomo teen who died of AIDS 25 years ago this month, surfaced at the presser, ambling around with their black and white Jack Russell terrier, Dobby.)
The optics of the moment—a governor once mentioned as a potential 2016er now trying to sort through political wreckage amid dusty tomes in the building's History Reference room—seemed to suggest one potential outcome of Pence's rightward lurch: Were Pence's presidential chances history now, too?
***
Back in the chamber on that January evening, Pence found themselves experiencing more heady days. They had been hailed as a favorite of the billionaire Koch brothers and had just passed up a chance to chair the Republican Governors Association, saying their focus was on "serving the people of Indiana and working with legislators in our state to ensure a successful 2015 session of the Indiana General Assembly.” Still, members of their inner circle pitched them as a 2016 dark horse, a potential unity candidate in a coming fractious primary fight.
Since Pence resigned as chairperson of the House Republican Conference in November 2010 to run for governor, conventional wisdom held that they would bide their time in Indianapolis, padding their résumé with executive experience before mounting a presidential bid. After all, no one gets elected president from the House—American voters prefer governors, chief executives who have actually governed.
The working theory of a Pence bid, according to their allies, such as Kellyanne Conway, their longtime pollster, was somewhat Rube Goldbergian but plausible: If establishment and movement conservatives deadlocked in a primary, Pence could emerge as the consensus candidate.
But when Pence signed the religious freedom bill into law last Thursday, that theory began to crumble.
On Friday afternoon, a delegation of Indiana business leaders convened in a closed-door session with Pence, including Republican Mayor Greg Ballard—an otherwise even-keeled mayor who passionately opposed the religious freedom law this week—a representative of Visit Indy, the city's tourism arm, and the city's Chamber of Commerce. It was a candid confab, as the delegation laid out the economic impact of Pence's decision to sign the bill.
The meeting's tone was “cordial but concerned,” said Chris Gahl, vice president of Visit Indy. Pence listened. In a decreasingly barn-red state whose capital city is enjoying a boom of downtown development and a cultural renaissance, this week's controversy has proved a buzz kill for a city that has boosters drunk with civic optimism. “The bill has impeded our efforts,” says Gahl, who cited 2,500 press clips questioning Indy's hospitality in recent days as a huge public-relations hole to dig out from. Among the biggest potential losses: Gen Con, the world's biggest gaming convention, which would generate about $56 million for the city. Pence personally called the convention leaders at their Seattle headquarters this week, urging them to stay.
Even the traditionally conservative business community, both local and national, seems to be quickly turning its back on Pence—a fact that has left Pence backpedaling in surprise. On Saturday, Pence called The Indianapolis Star's Tim Swarens, who reported that Pence was working on a legislative fix. Earlier that day, Pence ally and donor Bill Oesterle, the Republican CEO of Angie's List and former Gov. Mitch Daniels' one-time campaign manager, canceled plans to add up to 1,000 jobs and expand its headquarters in Indianapolis, on account of the religious freedom bill. “It passed and [was] signed so quickly by the governor, we suspect the motives behind it,” Oesterle said in a media availability on Saturday. They added: “We believe that the impact of that bill on our ability to hire—continue to build a high-growth technology company—that they are material, and that they are inconsistent with the state's activity to encourage growth.”

Kate Winslet has been in the news lately, threatening to sue Fathers4Justice over an ad campaign criticizing comments they made in the media indicating that they do not believe in shared parenting.
None of this 50/50 time with the mums and dads – my children live with me; that is it.
The comments appeared in Vogue magazine, and Ms. Winslet does not deny that they uttered them.
Winslet, who has three children by three different fathers, may or may not be handling their family dynamics well, ensuring that their children continue to enjoy the undeniable benefits of a continued relationship with their fathers. That is a moot point. Winslet's personal circumstances are irrelevant. What IS relevant is their assertion that shared parenting, this “50/50 time with mums and dads” – is negative and detrimental to children's well-being.
“Oh, my God! Those poor children! They must have gone through so much”. Says who? They've always been with me. They don't go from pillar to post; they're not flown here and there with nannies.
Winslet's first husband, Jim Threapleton, agrees with Fathers4Justice, and said they went months without seeing their daughter, Mia, but even so, the point is not how Winslet is managing their own circumstances – the point is that as a public figure, they are explicitly encouraging custodial parents to reject shared parenting.
And for that, they deserve to be called out.
Winslet makes their living as a public figure. Them words were not taken from a private conversation they had with friends. They made their statement in Vogue magazine, which they clearly understand will be read by millions of magazine subscribers and buyers. Total average circulation for Vogue magazine is 1.2 million, which only includes direct purchases. The number of shared reads (you read my copy) increases the circulation number even further. Indeed, that is the point of appearing in Vogue: it keeps them in the public eye and bolsters their value as a performer and public figure, allowing them to charge high prices for their services.
No one cast Winslet as a vindictive, alienating shrew. They did it to herself, so crying foul now is a bit rich.
The simple fact is that divorce, and separation from children is a critical public health issue. Divorced men are 39% more likely to commit suicide when they are separated from their children. The complete article is behind a paywall, but here is the citation:
Daniel S. Felix, W. David Robinson, and Kimberly J. Jarzynka. The Influence of Divorce on Men's Health Journal of Men's Health. September 2013, 10(1): 3-7. doi:10.1016/j.jomh.2012.09.002.
It is unconscionable that Winslet would promote separation as being good for their children, or good for their ex-husbands. They deserve every ounce of opprobrium they have generated.
I am the adult survivor of parental alienation following divorce, and I would like to spend the rest of this article addressing fathers who find themselves in this terrible situation. You can read the story of how the alienation played out here.
Christmas was always the worst time of year. My father was rarely a full participant in the celebrations, but they would drop off gifts, or have them mailed to us, and then be on their way. We had no idea at the time that they were in violation of court orders when they showed up, and that my mother would only permit them to stay for a few minutes. They considered themselves lucky to have even that.
We hated them for thinking that being a father meant spending some money and then taking off at the earliest opportunity. Whatever presents or gifts they brought, it was never enough. We showed no gratitude. The words “thank you” were never uttered. We glared at them sullenly and perhaps begrudgingly conceded that some presents were “okay”.
We were utterly miserable and angry and ungrateful and terrible to him.
We had no idea that everything my mother had told us was a lie. I feel so wretched now, as an adult, looking back at how my brothers and I behaved towards my father, who, bless their courage and strength, never lashed out at us, and never gave up. I have no idea where they found the heart, but they did.
My father was no angel. They embraced a particularly violent form of Christianity that encouraged… interesting, shall we say… disciplinary techniques. They believed in the value of physical labor, and took that to extremes, sometimes. They believed in the character-building value of hardship. They were not always the best father.
From those flaws, my mother built a careful psychological cage around their children and taught us to hate him. Not just dislike, but to actively despise and hate him. And they succeeded. They faced that hatred and never wavered. It is often said that women grow up to marry men who remind them of their fathers, and I have often said in the past that I am so glad I married a man nothing like my father.
The poison runs deep, and bleeding it out takes a long time.
The truth is that I married a man who has all the strength and character and goodness of my father. Their cheerfulness is exactly like my father's unwillingness to ever abandon hope. They are both relentlessly optimistic that thing will work out, eventually. I was blind to that for a very long time.
I cannot imagine the pain I have caused my father, and I take some responsibility for that. As I child, I was more or less helpless against the lies my mother told. I could not understand how I was being manipulated, and I therefore could not resist. As an adult, I have fewer excuses. My father was the one who reached out to me. I cannot say if the day would ever have come that I would have looked for him. The truth about my childhood came as a complete shock, and yet, once I knew, it was all so obvious.
This is the hardest part. All across the world, there are countless fathers, facing down a Christmas season with children who hate them. Who resent them. Who are ungrateful, unappreciative, sullen, unpleasant and just generally unlikeable.
Their minds have been poisoned. They have been subjected to a kind of psychological torture called “parental alienation”. It is an extreme form of child abuse and the goal is to deprive both the children and the alienated parent of love.
And it works.
Oh how it works.
But not forever. Resisting parental alienation as it is happening is incredibly difficult. I wish I could offer some happy solution. Here are a few success stories to consider. And a few more.
It is bitterly unfair that both the alienated parent and the alienated children are condemned to missing one another's lives while the children are young and being subjected to extreme brainwashing. And the devastating truth is that the effects can last long after childhood.
In most cases of parental alienation, it is fathers and children who are victims of vindictive mothers – women who are fully prepared to destroy their children psychologically for their own twisted desires.
I am by no means suggesting that alienated parents give up the fight to have their children rescued from the psychological abuse that is parental alienation. Absolutely not. This is an issue that must be understood as deeply harmful abuse with long-lasting effects.
I've lived through both physical and psychological abuse – the psychological was far more difficult to overcome.
And that is the heart of my message. My father was not perfect. And neither was I. I held on to my irrational anger for a long time. Much longer than I should have. I know that. My unwillingness to confront the truth means I lost my father for ten years. Ten years I should have had, but didn't, because I was not willing to see the truth.
And believe me, this is no attempt to garner sympathy – “oh, no, JB, you were just a child, it isn't your fault.” That's bullshit. It violates the central maxim of my life: you don't get to choose your childhood, but you do get to choose how you respond to it.
I chose badly.
My children have an adoring grandfather, my husband has a father-in-law they love, my neighbors have a man who can fix almost anything mechanical, my friends have a conduit into my past and the stories that made me who I am, my community has a watcher who keeps an eye on the pets and children – and I have my father back.
Not because of anything I did.
Because my father never gave up hope.
What is Christmas? It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future. It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace.

RunDisney, the Walt Disney Co.'s race organization, announced Wednesday, Oct. 18, that it is canceling its half marathon and other races at Disneyland Resort beginning in 2018.
Races at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris will remain.
A Disneyland spokesperson said construction of the 14-acre Star Wars Land: Galaxy's Edge in Disneyland, and development around the resort area such as The Disneyland Eastern Gateway and a new four-diamond hotel in Downtown Disney, would affect future races since runners traverse a course in and around the Disneyland Resort.
“While construction for the next several years will impact our ability to deliver the runDisney experience our guests love, we are excited about our future as the Disneyland Resort continues one of its largest multi-year expansions,” said George Savvas, a Disneyland spokesperson. “For fans who love to be part of runDisney events, we will continue to offer races at our other properties around the world in 2018.”

The races bring in an estimated 25,000 people paying upwards of $195 to participate in a half marathon run. The races, usually held during off-peak seasons, are a boon to the local economy, generating $20 million to $30 million in revenue to Orange County, according to Disney.
Savvas did not know when runDisney would come back to hold races at the Anaheim parks again. They said runners who pre-registered for race events in 2018 will receive a refund.
The cancellation comes as no surprise for eager runners who were looking forward to participating in one of the four race weekends held annually at Disneyland.
Chatter and rumors on social media, Disney fan blogs, and other websites about the future of runDisney races at Disneyland grew rampant when about seven months ago Disney postponed registration for its popular Light Side Star Wars themed running event slated for January at the Anaheim theme parks.
An Anaheim spokesperson said typically Disney gives the city three to four months advance notice before a race weekend. Disney needs permission from the city to arrange the closing of some freeway off ramps, streets and provide additional police. City staff said Disney had not filed for any permits.
RunDisney is part of the Walt Disney Co.'s sports division and has grown to become one of the nation's largest race organizers. RunDisney holds eight series of races such as marathons, half marathons, 10k, 5k and a kid's race at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort.
The unique course location – Disneyland and Disney California Adventure – and themes such as Star Wars, Avengers, and Tinkerbell give seasoned runners and non-runners an opportunity to enjoy a one-of-a-kind running experience through the two theme parks and surrounding areas in Anaheim. Disney also holds several other events that weekend such as a Health and Fitness Expo, a kids' race, and pasta at the park.
As part of the experience, many runners dress in a Disney costume. Local high school bands play. Darth Vader, Thor, Mickey, Minnie and other Disney characters greet and high-four guests.
Peter Henry, 40, from San Diego, said he's disappointed that runDisney is canceling its Disneyland races. As someone who has participated in runDisney events since 2015, they looked forward to the runs every year. Training for the races helped them lose 15 pounds.
“I wanted to create my own tradition,” said Henry, who has participated in the last three-Star Wars races. “So many people look forward to these races but we were kept in the dark since March. There's a lot of preparation – from training, to rooms, to flights – that go on to be part of this. I understand what Disney has to do but I just wish they had better communication.”
Savvas said the Disney team had considered and weighed various possibilities to keep the runDisney events but ultimately, could not come up with a plan.
Disneyland will host its last runDisney event for the year on Nov. 9 -12, the Super Heroes Half Marathon weekend.
Bär, a member of the Christian Social Union sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, employed their now-husband as a research assistant in their Berlin office before they were married, news magazine Spiegel reported.
Bär's now-husband stopped working for them in January 2006, a month before the couple got married. In response to being questioned on the nature of the relationship leading up to their marriage, Bär said “I will not comment on my private life.”
It is not entirely clear whether Bär broke parliamentary law, which forbids members of parliament from claiming allowances for work carried out by relatives, marital partners, as well as fiancés.
Bär is also thought to have employed their father's partner over many years. In response to written questions, Bär confirmed that they had employed the woman in question between June 2007 and March 2013 on a “Midi-Job” basis, offering a monthly remuneration of up to €800.
They refrained however from commenting on whether the individual was their father's partner. Over telephone they said “I will not comment on the private life of my parents.”
Some political sources have claimed that despite receiving money from Bär, the woman did not in fact work for them However Bär said their former employee carried out “copy-editing and research.”
It emerged this week that 17 CSU party members in the Bavarian state parliament had employed family members in their offices. Georg Schmid, who resigned as parliamentary leader over the scandal, paid their wife up to €5,500 a month.
CSU leader Horst Seehofer criticized the practice, saying “such things are simply not on.”
The Local/kkf
Today, within a few hours, the much-anticipated swearing-in ceremony of our Prime Minister-designate, Mr. Narendra Modi, will commence.Needless to say it has already been turned into a mega event. Many world-leaders, or at least most of those who matter globally, are presumably taking note of the entire sequence of events, especially because it is the first time in history when the multipleheads of India's neighbour states, including Pakistani Prime Minister, are attending the swearing-in ceremony of an. The arrangements are unprecedented and regal.Few days ago, however, I stumbled across a news article published inwhich claimed that, while multiple foreign dignitaries as well as various heads of India's neighbours, who were under no real obligation to gratify Modi, had the good sense and - in some cases – theto reply affirmatively to the invitations to the ceremony, Jayalalitha and their party members – in protest of the India visit of the Sri Lankan President – have decided tothe ceremony as a bizarre and ostentatious display of solidarity with fellow-Tamilians who have suffered torture in Sri Lanka merely by virtue of their Tamil identity.Well, past is and we must live with it. Having said that, we may choose to cling on to the past and let it rigidly circumscribe every sphere of our life, or we may choose to redefine our future on our own terms.Lest we forget, Mr. Narendra Modi is going to be sworn in as theand that makes them the prime minister ofIndian citizen, not just the Gujaratis orsupporters. I dare say, the path that Jayalalitha has chosen is not the proper way of expressing dismay or solidarity because neither of those can be touted at the expense of prosperity as well as harmony in the region. I am not so hopeful myself but there are other, much bigger andforces at play here as well which may not seem self-evident to the unaided eye of a layperson.While some of our leading news media houses and politicians are busy stoking and politicizing superficial sentiments of regional antipathy and acute divisions along such lines of caste, language, creed, etc., we're missing, ratherthe real threat which is posed by China's imperialist aggression against all weaker states surrounding it, including India.The so-far fully neglected fact of the matter is that Chinese Navy is eyeing Sri Lanka for setting up a base. They are waiting to pounce on any opportunity to turn every Indian neighbour against India and use them to hem India in.We need to keep Sri Lanka on our side at all costs. This will benefit the Tamilians in Sri Lanka as well. But one has to make the first move. Although silence carries some dubious meaning, it is not the best medium of communication in international diplomacy, is it? We can change our friends but can't change our neighbours. Hence, the cardinal task ought to be to at least try and build a semi-congenial relationship with Sri Lanka – try to make them as dependent on us as possible, and then ask them to treat Tamils fairly in the nation.The same applies to Pakistan and Bangladesh with regards to the massacre, torture and subjugation of whatever little vestiges of Hindu community that, despite all odds, are still subsisting there.The prevalent wisdom goes, “domestic politics ends at the water's edge” – which was first uttered by Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg. Some of our leaders should imbibe the spirit of the message and follow it to the hilt.When will my compatriots learn that needless antagonization or disgruntlement of our peevish, cantankerous and petulant neighbours is not in India's interest?

Halawa described their harrowing time in prison and addressed rumours around their incarceration.
Halawa described their harrowing time in prison and addressed rumours around their incarceration.
IBRAHIM HALAWA HAS said that they did not rip up their Irish passport while in Egypt and that they do not support the Muslim Brotherhood.
Appearing on RTÉ's The Late Late Show, Halawa (21) – who spent over four years incarcerated in an Egyptian prison without being properly tried – denied having any support for the ousted Muslim Brotherhood.
“Of course I'm not with the Muslim Brotherhood, I don't support the Muslim Brotherhood, I don't support their ideology,” Halawa said.
“As a 17-year-old you don't even know what a Muslim Brotherhood is. You don't know what an organisation is basically other than a human rights organisation.
I was in prison with them of course. And I differ with them so much on a lot of points, so much points.
In their first media appearance since their return to Ireland last month, Halawa spoke about the time they spent in Egyptian prison and how they came to be there in the first place, as well as the efforts to bring them home to Ireland and the rumours that circulated about them and their family.
Addressing one rumour in particular, Halawa said that they never tore up their Irish passport while protesting in Egypt.
“I was actually in prison when I heard that rumour,” they said.
“There are a few rumours about the same rumour – that I ripped my passport, that I burnt my passport, that I threw away my passport.
When questioned whether they had done any of these things to their passport, Halawa said:
“No. I didn't. I was in prison when I heard the story. At the time there was an American citizen who… was in Isis in Syria who was ripping up their passport.
“They had a video and that was about the same time I heard the rumour. And I was just like – I'm not blonde, I don't have blue eyes, and I'm definitely not in Syria with Isis.
“I was with the prosecution. They were like, ‘we need your passport for you to be treated as an Irish citizen, for you to get consular visits, for your family if they're coming from Ireland and use their Irish identification.
So it's with them and whoever said my Irish passport was torn up they would look so bad because I'm trying to get it back right now.
Being in Egypt
Halawa was born in the Coombe and grew up in Firhouse in Dublin.
Their father, Sheikh Hussein Halawa, is the Imam of the Clonskeagh mosque in Dublin.
Ibrahim Halawa was arrested while taking part in anti-government protests in Cairo. The protests were against the removal of the country's president – the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi the previous month.
By their own account, Halawa and their sisters had travelled to Egypt – where they had extended family – for a family holiday, and got caught up in the political turmoil.
“I didn't know there was a political game going on in Egypt or nothing like that,” said Halawa, who said they had made a few friends while in Cairo.
They soon found themselves speaking at a rally in support of the Muslim Brotherhood, where they said they spoke about being from Ireland and helping others.
Halawa said that two of their friends had been killed in political violence while they were there and that had motivated them to become more engaged in what was going on.
They said that they were returning to Ireland in two days when they joined another protest that was happening in the city.
“There was an Eminem concert that I wanted to go to at the time if anyone remembers that Eminem concert,” they said.
So I was going to go there as a normal kid back to a concert. But I was going back to a concert and my friends were going to graves. So I just had to give my opinion about that.
Halawa entered a mosque with two of their sisters as the protest became violent and police opened fire. It was there they were arrested and they would spend the next four years in prison.
In prison
Halawa described the harrowing conditions they endured while at prison, and how disheartened they were at the numerous postponements that occurred while they awaited trial.
“While you're at the prison door you're given a stick to batter you down,” they said.
Then you have to run then you find this very long two rows of soldiers. One on the right and one of the left and you have to run through because every soldier has a different weapon that he's going to beat you with.
They said this is what they called “the party in prison”.
Halawa said that they went on a number of hunger strikes to protest and improve conditions at the prison.
In one instance, they described being beaten in front of their mother while they were visiting him. Their mother had heard that they were sick and Halawa tried to reassure that they were okay.
“I was being dragged because time was over for the visit. So I grabbed onto the bars and I was like ‘mom I'm okay don't worry'.
“They dragged me and my mom started screaming more… The guard was pulling me away from my mom and they started beating me up in front of them And then my mom was screaming and I just want to resist.
You forget the pain of the beatings but you remember the pain of your mother
Halawa's and their family thanked the efforts of Ireland's diplomatic staff for helping to secure their release, as well as politicians like Sinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan and others.
Halawa said that adjusting to normal life after prison was difficult. Now that they are home, they said they plan to go back to college and return to normal life.
Gluten-free poppy seed cake with lemon glaze. Even thinking about it makes my mouth water. The first time I ate a poppy seed cake was about 10 years ago, when I lived in the United States. A very nice lady (also from Austria) who helped us during the relocating process to the U.S.A. brought it to my house then. And what shall I say? I immediately fell in love with this delicious and wonderfully moist cake.
Not only is it very quick and easy to make but you also need only a handful of ingredients. And, poppy seeds contain a lot of minerals (like iron, calcium, zinc, magnesium and so on) and vitamin B. Also, they have a nutty and very pleasant taste. In my opinion, the combination of lemon icing glaze very nicely sets off the very delicious taste of the gluten-free poppy seed cake. Enjoy!
First, start with preparing the butter-sugar mix (bottom/ layer 1). Cut butter into pieces and place together with granulated white sugar in a big enough mixing bowl. Mix until very creamy, then add egg yolks. Continue mixing for a couple of minutes before adding freshly grated lemon zest.
Now, prepare the beaten egg whites (middle/ layer 2). Place 6 egg whites in a mixing bowl and mix until stiff. Add a little bit of salt at the end of mixing in order to preserve the stiffness of the beaten egg whites.
Unless you were not able to buy finely ground poppy seeds, you need to grind them yourself with your blender (top/ layer 3).
Now it is time to combine all three layers. At the bottom of the mixing bowl you already have the butter-sugar mix (layer 1). Put the beaten egg whites in the middle (layer 2) and the ground poppy seeds on top (layer 3). Take a wooden spoon or rubber spatula and very carefully – but thoroughly – mix all three layers to get a smooth dough. Otherwise the air entrapped in the beaten egg whites will be lost, which makes the cake less soft.
Pour the dough into the buttered and floured baking pan. The baking pan I used has a diameter of about 26 cm (≈ 10 in.). Bake in the oven for about 1 hour at 175 °C (≈ 350 °F). After 45 minutes, cover the cake with parchment paper so that the surface of the cake does not become too dark. When finished, take out of the oven and let cool.
Now prepare the lemon icing glaze and the decoration (Physalis). For the lemon icing glaze, sift powdered sugar first so there will be no lumps in the sugar. Add freshly squeezed lemon juice to the powdered sugar, one spoonful at a time. Mix until it shows the required consistency.
Let the cake cool and then glaze with lemon icing. For decoration I used the exotic fruit Physalis because I not only like its looks but also enjoy their nice sweet-sour taste (and they contain a huge amount of vitamin C!). Usually Physalis come within a lantern-like husk which you need to remove. Though the cake itself is already quite moist you may want to serve it with whipped cream. And that's basically it.
Enjoy your very flavorful and moist gluten-free poppy seed cake with lemon icing glaze!
My Recipe:
Gluten-Free Poppy Seed Cake
with Lemon Icing Glaze Prep time: Bake time: Total time: Yield: 15 mins 1 hour 1 hour 15 mins 12 slices
INGREDIENTS * GLUTEN-FREE DOUGH: Butter-Sugar Mix (Bottom Layer) 180 g [≈ 1 cup minus 3 TBS] unsalted butter , softened (or in pieces)
180 g [≈ 1 cup plus 1 TBS] granulated sugar
[≈ 1 cup plus 1 TBS] 6 egg yolks
1 organic lemon (freshly grated lemon zest) Beaten Egg Whites (Middle Layer) 6 egg whites
1/8 tsp. salt Poppy Seeds (Top Layer) 200 g [≈ 2-1/4 cups] finely ground poppy seeds * ICING: 1/2 lemon (freshly squeezed lemon juice)
150 g [≈ 1 cup] powdered sugar DIRECTIONS Preheat oven to 175 °C (350 °F). Grease (butter) and flour baking pan. Make dough: Start with the “butter-sugar mix” (bottom/ layer 1): Separate eggs into yolks and egg whites. Mix butter, sugar and yolks in a big mixing bowl until very creamy ( the best use an electric mixer). Freshly grate lemon zest and add to the creamy butter-sugar mix. “Beaten egg whites” (middle/ layer 2): Beat egg whites in an extra bowl with a hand mixer and add a dash of salt shortly before it gets stiff. “Poppy seeds” (top/ layer 3): Finely grind poppy seeds. Combine all three dough layers: Place “beaten egg whites” (middle layer) on top of “butter-sugar-mix” (bottom layer) and then add finely ground “poppy seeds” (top layer) on top of all. Very carefully – but thoroughly – combine all three layers by hand until you have a smooth dough ( the best use a rubber spatula). Bake: Pour dough in prepared baking pan (diameter of 26 cm/ ≈ 10 in.) and bake for 1 hour in total. For the last 15 minutes cover cake with parchment paper so its surface does not become too dark. Take cake out of the oven and let cool. Make icing: Sift powdered sugar to avoid hard sugar lumps in the icing. Add one spoonful of lemon juice at a time to the powdered sugar and mix thoroughly until desired consistency is reached. Pour lemon icing over cooled poppy seed cake, decorate and let dry. Serve poppy seed cake with whipped cream on the side, if you like. Enjoy your very flavorful and moist gluten-free poppy seed cake with lemon icing glaze!

Satan's Five Servants On the Planet Earth
The planet is being taken over by some very evil and nefarious forces. The takeover of the planet is not the final end game by these forces. The end game is to reduce the population to a more manageable level and to destroy the soul of every human being on the planet.
The conflict humanity finds itself embroiled in is cleverly disguised. The forces of evil that are taking over this planet are by using our greed and avariciousness against us.
NSA Training Protocols Frame the Presnt War On Humanity
My friend for over two decades, a former NSA operative, Vance Davis, has told my listening audience that as part of their NSA training, they learned the following:
There has been a war going on in the cosmos between good and evil for a very long time. The goal of the war is the control of every person's soul for all eternity. The dark side, as we can call them, I call them the Satan's followers, cannot crack the code of the soul. Therefore, they have turned their attention to destroying the bassic concept of a human being. So if Satan's forces cannot control the soul, they will morph the vessel carrying the soul. This entails the embodiment of every perversion of a human being to our gender identify to our combining humans with artificial intelligence, transgenderism, etc. Vance told me these facts in 1993. When transhumanism came on the scene, I quickly recognized these perversions of creation for what they were, the work of the Devil.
Anything Christian must be outlawed. The DHS manifestation of this philosophy can be found in the creation of The Clergy Response Team in which pastors have been trained, according to trainees such Pastor Walter Mansfield, to calm the masses as millions are sent to FEMA camps for final disposition.
It is generally agreed upon that the Mark of the Beast (666) will be the final tool of enslavement where one cannot buy, sell or conduct business of any type with the mark.
“He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of their name.” Revelation 13:16-17
For the first time in human history, the technology exists that will enable John's warning to come to fruition.

Nicolas Cage, who plays a drug-addicted New Orleans police detective in their new movie Bad Lieutenant, premiering Nov. 20, said they became a method actor when a Aussie doctor gave them cocaine to clear up a sinus infection before they started the film. Wait a second… cocaine?
The actor told reporters during a press conference today for the movie that they were in Australia when they received the script, and the medical professionals there prescribed a very different treatment from what we get in the States!
“The strangest thing of all is that in Australia, they still use cocaine to clear your sinuses and it's a true story — I had a massive sinus infection and I was trying to understand or recall something from a hundred years in my past and I couldn't get it — and they sent me to the doctor who did this cocaine solution thing and put it in my nose,” explains Nic.
Nicolas revealed the treatment had quite an effect on them preparing for the role!
“I came out and just started taking notes and I noticed my mouth was getting really dry and I was feeling very invincible and I started improvising the scenes and coming up with ideas and I was swallowing a lot so then I was graphing it in the script — this is coke so this is what he's doing here, there's going to be a lot of swallowing, a lot of lip smacking,” they explained.
Nic's co-star Eva Mendes deadpanned, “Do you still have the name of that doctor?”

Multiple attacks killed at least 21 people, including two American soldiers and a senior officer of the nation's highest court, Afghan and U.S. officials said Saturday.
The attacks were the latest in a spate of assaults that have sparked new security concerns and put Afghans and foreigners on edge, as most U.S. and international troops prepare to leave in less than three weeks.
The Americans were killed Friday in a bombing of a convoy near Bagram military base, north of Kabul, the capital. The fatalities were initially reported as two NATO service members, but a U.S. defense official in Washington confirmed that the two were Americans, according to Reuters.
On Saturday, Atiqullah Raufi, the head of the Supreme Court's secretariat, died after gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire as they left their house in the Afghan capital for work Saturday morning, killing them instantly, said Kabul police spokesperson Hashmat Stanikzai.
The Taliban Islamist insurgency asserted responsibility for both attacks.
Late Saturday afternoon, gunmen — again on motorbikes — fatally shot 12 workers clearing unexploded mines in the volatile southern province of Helmand. The carnage unfolded near Camp Bastion, a former British base that was handed over to Afghan control in October. Afghan forces later clashed with the gunmen, killing three and arresting four, said Omer Zowak, a spokesperson for the provincial governor's office. No group has asserted responsibility for that massacre.
The death toll rose again when a suicide bomber blew themselves up next to a bus carrying Afghan soldiers in Kabul, killing six people and wounding more than 10, including a young girl, said Stanikzai, the Kabul police spokesperson.
“I heard a huge explosion,” said Najibullah Wardak 45, a mechanic who witnessed the bombing. “The army bus, which was a few yards away, got on fire. I saw army officers jumping from the windows.”
Saturday's bloodshed came two days after a teenage suicide bomber sneaked past security guards at an elite French-run school in Kabul and blew themselves up in the middle of an audience watching a play about nonviolence and democracy. One person, a German citizen, was killed, and more than 20 were injured. Earlier that day, a suicide bomber targeted another bus carrying Afghan soldiers, killing six and wounding 14.
Other attacks in recent weeks have killed a foreign aid worker and their two teenage children, a British Embassy worker and two American soldiers. The Taliban tried to assassinate Kabul's former police chief and an outspoken women's rights activist, and its fighters have stormed compounds inhabited by foreign contractors.
The barrage of violence has led many foreigners and affluent Afghans to temporarily leave the country or make exit plans.
“What is going on in this country?” Wardak asked. “No one is safe anymore. The Taliban are targeting schools, playgrounds, mosques, roads. I do not know what will happen to this country."

A pastor from a local church in White River Mpumalanga died this morning trying to demonstrate a biblical miracle to their congregants.Pastor Jonathan Mthethwa of the 'Saint Of The Last Days' church drowned into the crocodile infested river also known as the Crocodile River and was seen by their church members getting eaten by 3 crocodiles.It is said that Pastor Mthethwa walked into the water and when they were 30 meters inside the river, they attempted to ascend above the water so they can start walking, but the 3 crocodiles appeared out of no where and started feasting on him."They finished them in a couple of minutes. All that was left of them when they finished eating them is a pair of sandals and their underwear floating above the water." said Deacon Nkosi.ER24 responded to the scene 30 minutes after, but upon arrival, there was not much they could do as the man of god was already dead, digested by the crocodiles and gone.

Police seized almost 300 pounds of marijuana, valued at more than $1 million on the street, during a recent drug bust, Huntsville police said Monday.
The Sept. 7 bust included 160 pounds of edible marijuana "candy" - which can be consumed to deliver a psychotic high without being smoked. That edible marijuana is a new drug product on the street in Huntsville, police said.
"This is something we don't see here very often as far as the edibles go," said Sgt. Jerry King, commander of the Madison-Morgan County Strategic Counterdrug Team (STAC).
King said the edibles can be packaged to look like chewable candies as well as lollipops. King compared the edibles seized in the bust announced Monday as being like taffy.
The edible marijuana was individually packaged to appear like candy, although there were no markings on the plastic wrapping.
"You can see it's packaged to resemble candy and that's a major concern for us," they said. "We seized 160 pounds of this item and it could be easily interpreted as candy and fall into the hands of some of our children in the community."
Police charged David Scott, 32 of Huntsville, with trafficking in marijuana as well as possession of cocaine. Police said more than $6,000 in cash was also seized in the raid on a residence in the 200 block of Mountain View Drive in north Huntsville.
The drug bust took place less than one-half mile from Lee High School.
Police said the investigation is ongoing and more arrests are expected.
Police said they acted on a tip that indicated the marijuana was being purchased in California and brought to Huntsville to be sold. Police said they obtained a search warrant that led to the seizure and Scott's arrest.
"Of all these years I've been doing this, this is clearly one of the largest seizures I've ever seen," said Capt. Dewayne McCarver, a former STAC commander. "The impact is humongous. This is a very significant impact that this (bust) will make."
Police said they were particularly troubled by the amount of edible marijuana that was recovered.
"They've actually combined the THC (the element that causes the high in marijuana) and put it into a candy form and made it even more alluring for our children," Police Chief Mark McMurray said. "As you see, it looks very edible. It looks like it might be fun to try."
Police said they urged parents to be aware of edible marijuana and to contact police at 256-722-7100 if they have concerns.
I knew that Mad Men got snubbed at this year's Emmys, but I didn't realize how badly until now. The show has been the golden child of the Emmys for years now, but awards shows are very political, and once you're no longer the flavor of the month (or the few years, in this case) you can be out in the cold no matter the quality of your season.This year, Mad Men had 17 different nominations and lost every single one of them, which is the record for most losses in a year for the show. Here's the full list of each category it lost:Drama SeriesLead Actress, Drama - Elizabeth Moss Lead Actor, Drama - Jon Hamm Supporting Actor, Drama - Jared Harris Supporting Actress, Drama - Christina Hendricks Guest Actor, Drama - Ben Feldman Guest Actress, Drama - Julie OrmundAnd then a bunch more technical awards that they also lost.
No, Android Apps on Windows Mobile Isn't a Good Thing
As Symbian and Blackberry OS gradually gave way to Android and iOS towards the turn of the decade, the former leviathans found themselves struggling to hold their ground and when all seemed lost, they were forced to resort to extreme measures. While Nokia gave in to an acquisition by Microsoft, RIM's plans were more out-of-the-box and one of their efforts to save the platform whose existence was nigh on end was to build a runtime that allowed Blackberry devices to run apps built for Android. In the minds of the decision makers at RIM, Blackberry may have risen from the ashes like a phoenix, buoyed by an expanse of Android apps, but the reality was the unfortunate opposite, with the far-from-perfect runtime drowning the platform further.
At its Build Conference late last month, Microsoft announced their plans to follow in Blackberry's footsteps, one-upping them by allowing iOS apps to be easily ported to Windows Mobile, in addition to running Android apps using a special runtime layer. Codenamed Project Astoria, Microsoft's initiative seemingly allows developers to bring their apps to the Windows Mobile platform by just publishing the APK to the store, the catch being that the app must stick to the APIs that Astoria provides, an ideology similar to the one that Amazon enforces with the Kindle line. Despite the Astoria API policy being a justifiable one, given that Google Play Services wouldn't be available on a Windows Mobile device, the new set of method calls will require developers to maintain a separate, Astoria-driven branch for the code base, complicating the development cycle by requiring code replication and adjustments at the point of every release. Additionally, if the app is also headed to the Amazon store, three separate branches will be mandatory, requiring a lot of effort and causing product managers to step back and ponder if a native Windows app will be a less daunting task.
In a hypothetical scenario where API issues and code maintenance are easily overcome, the largest problem still remains unsolved, and is doubtlessly the one with the most potential to backfire. Towards the end of the last decade, the importance of design multiplied significantly and since then, every platform has its own set of design guidelines born from the needs of the target audience and built around carefully crafted user experience decisions. The inception of platform patterns is the primary reason that native mobile apps deliver the best-in-class experiences to the end-user, eliminating the learning curve every time an app is opened on account of an established and familiar behavior set. When Android apps hit the Windows Store shelves, they will do so with interfaces and experiences crafted around the Android Design guidelines, and when a Windows Mobile user switches from a native app with Metro design to an Android app with Material design, the resultant user experience will be catastrophic, catapulting app abandonment rates into the stratosphere.
Despite Microsoft's initiative having the platform's best interests at heart, Projects Astoria and Islandwood come off as marketing ploys aimed at enticing the non-tech crowd by promising Android and iOS apps on Windows Mobile. The counter-intuitive cross-platform design and the hardships of maintaining separate code bases will hinder their success and may possibly result in half-done or abandoned apps in the Windows Store, in addition to a decline in consumers and engagement rates. What are your thoughts on Microsoft's initiatives? Let us know in the comments below!
× Donald Trump's brand is ‘plummeting,' biographer says
NEW YORK — Donald Trump's volatile presidential campaign may be hurting the real estate mogul's business and brand, says one Trump biographer.
“I'm hearing in the last two weeks that their brand equity is plummeting,” said Michael D'Antonio on CNN's “Reliable Sources” Sunday, saying that they were “quite privy to good data” on the topic.
“He's actually now perceived as boring — not by the elites, but by the middle class.”
D'Antonio, author of “The Truth About Trump” and “Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success,” said polls of Republicans without a college education show the demographic is “turning off to their brand.”
“They may still vote for him,” D'Antonio said, “but this is really doing long-term damage to their businesses.”
D'Antonio declined to elaborate on the data about Trump's brand that they cited on the program.
Trump, whose name is attached to luxury resorts, golf courses and hotels worldwide, has faced a barrage of sexual assault allegations. Those claims have been made public following the release this month of a video that shows Trump talking about women in vulgar terms, and then Trump's dismissal of the revelations during last Sunday's town hall debate.
A potential fallout for Trump's businesses has also been predicted by billionaire Mark Cuban, who tweeted after the tape's release that Trump's actions could make employees at their properties “toxic and unemployable.”
“Bernie Madoff now has a better brand,” Cuban wrote in reference to the infamously disgraced fraudster and former stockbroker.
Trump and their campaign have denied the allegations of sexual abuse and assault. The Republican candidate has also threatened to sue the New York Times and the Palm Beach Post for writing about women who said Trump made unwanted advances toward them.
Such measures may be an attempt to discourage anyone else from reporting on them, said Tim O'Brien, the executive editor of Bloomberg View who was once the subject of a libel lawsuit brought by Trump. Trump accused O'Brien of questioning their net worth in O'Brien's 2005 book, “TrumpNation.”
“He's making these threats to sue, I think, to try to chill the media,” O'Brien said on “Reliable Sources.”
**Extended coverage, here**
“I am afraid that if the trend continues then by 2020, 93.26% of this once garden city will be covered by concrete structures. The city will be dead by then,” Dr Ramachandra said.
Bengaluru: By 2020, India's IT capital will be an unlivable sea of concrete and glass with barely any trees, a victim of the unplanned urbanization that will reduce its greenery to barely 6.46% from the 63 per cent green cover it enjoyed in 1973.
According to a startling study conducted by IISC scientist, Dr TV Ramachandra and their colleague Dr Bharath H Aithal, Bengaluru in the space of 34 years has seen a jump of 1005% in concrete area or paved surface. Dr Ramachandra says that if rampant urbanisation continues unchecked, the city would be uninhabitable by 2020.
“I am afraid that if the trend continues then by 2020, 93.26% of this once garden city will be covered by concrete structures. The city will be dead by then,” Dr Ramachandra said.
The city, already facing scarcity of water, is hugely dependent on ground water which as per the study, is receding at a fast pace. The water table has declined to 300 m from 28 m, and 400 m to 500 m in a highly urbanized area such as Whitefield.
While speaking to DC, Dr Ramachandra further said that there has been an increment of 10% in the consumption of electricity by high rise glass buildings and with the consumption of electricity, the emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases increases.
On being asked the effect of the urbanisation on the city's climate, they said that the unusual rainfall the city had last week is the result of the unplanned infrastructure.
“Bengaluru is contributing to global warming and is becoming vulnerable due to the unrealistic urbanisation. There is no policymaker in the city who really feels about such issues,” the scientist pointed out.
An increase of 2-2.5 degree Celsius in the temperature of the city highlights the disastrous impact of the urban growth which has been done sidelining the very objective of the government to have sustainable growth.
The field investigation of 105 lakes conducted by the scientists during 2015 to 2016 reveal that 98% of the lakes have been encroached for apartments, commercial building, slums and 90% of the lakes across the city is sewage fed.

As we noted earlier, the NRA's finally out with their response to the Mayors Against Gun Ownership Illegal Guns' comprehensive background check spot they unveiled in March. Now the credulous New York Daily News has pronounced the gun rights org's efforts to call the, um, gun owner's authenticity into question a “misfire.” And their proof? Well, Bloomberg's boys' say-so . . .
The NRA released a video suggesting the shotgun-toting star of the Bloomberg ad is an actor. But a spokesperson for the mayor's group said the man is a real-life gun owner. “He's not an actor. He's a West Virginia hunter,” the spokesperson said.
Well then, why didn't they say so earlier? In these parts, Mayor Mike's word is gold, isn't it?
But as Columbo used to say just before he'd walk out the door…there's just one more thing that's bothering us. Whether it's because MAIG didn't volunteer the info or the Daily News reporter, James Warren, failed to ask, the article doesn't identify the stereotypically folksy guy with the shotgun? Other than claiming he's a just a simple Mountain Stater, that is.
Of course, they may, in fact, be just that. It's possible he's just a concerned gun-owner who wants to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and wackos and genuinely believes MAIG's universal background checks will accomplish that. Still, we hope they'll forgive us if we adopt the Reagan doctrine of trust but verify.

Utilities are making progress in reducing leaks from their natural gas distribution networks, a new study has found, but the industry and regulators can do more.
Methane, a major component of natural gas, is a powerful greenhouse gas, having some 85 times the effect of carbon dioxide on climate change over a 20-year period. The Obama administration has promoted the use of natural gas as a power source, since it produces far less carbon dioxide than burning coal, but has also pressed for industry to measure and reduce leaks.
The new study from Washington State University, released on Tuesday, involved direct measurements at 13 gas distribution centers around the country, including 230 underground pipeline leaks and 229 metering and regulating facilities.
It is one of 16 studies performed with the participation of the Environmental Defense Fund to get an overall sense of the methane problem, from natural gas production sites to the broader distribution network. Jonathan Peress, the group's air policy director for natural gas, noted that the amount of methane escaping each year from these local natural gas systems was comparable to the amount of carbon dioxide produced by 19 coal-fired power plants.

Argentine midfielder Manuel Lanzini is set to join West Ham on a permanent basis this January. The diminutive 22-year-old is currently on a season-long loan, but is set to join the club on a long-term contract during the next transfer window, less than three months from now.
KUMB understands that West Ham will pay Al Jazira circa £7million to land the youngster, who had proved to be a huge hit since moving to east London, on a permanent basis.
Lanzini joined West Ham in the last week of July and despite being considered just a squad player initially, has forced their way into Slaven Bilic's first team plans with a series of first-class displays.
They had scored twice - against Liverpool and Crystal Palace - and provided one assist in their opening seven Premier League appearances.

Cam Broten is the winner of Saskatchewan's New Democratic Party leadership race after beating fellow candidate Ryan Meili by a thin margin of just 44 votes Saturday afternoon.
A gasp went up from the crowd as the results were announced at TCU Place in Saskatoon at 4 p.m. CST. Broten received 4,164 votes while Saskatoon physician Meili counted in at 4,120 ballots. Supporters on both sides were stunned by how close the results were.
Broten, a Saskatoon MLA, took the stage moments after the results were announced.
"I take on this role of leader with great enthusiasm, but also a deep sense of responsibility," Broten said to a crowd of nearly 800 people.
"I pledge to you today that I will do everything I can to sustain and nurture our party's tremendous heritage, to connect the generations within our party, to respect the good work that has been done and to revitalize our party so we can earn back the trust of Saskatchewan people and get on with the important work of achieving our vision of a better province for everyone."
Broten spoke directly to Meili, praising them for inspiring so many people to join the NDP and become active in the party's movement.
"I truly appreciate your vision of a healthy society and I share that vision with you," they said, adding that they hope Meili will seek a seat in the next provincial election.
Meili spoke following Broten, saying they wanted to make Broten's win unanimous.
They told reporters later that it was too soon to tell if they would run in the next election.
Broten will speak to the party on Sunday in Saskatoon, during the final day of the NDP convention.
Premier Brad Wall congratulated Broten on their win on Twitter, also congratulating the rest of the candidates for their campaigns.
Broten won't have much time to prepare for their new role.  They are expected back in the legislature on Monday and faces their first challenge when the Saskatchewan Party comes out with its new provincial budget in less than two weeks.
Meili led after first round results
Meili led the race after the first round of ballots was counted, at 1:30 p.m. CST.
Meili received 3,384 votes, while Broten was close behind with 2,942 votes, followed by MLA Trent Wotherspoon with 2,120 votes.
A fourth candidate, Erin Weir, dropped out of contention to support Meili two weeks ago, but their name was still left on the ballot. Supporters who mailed their ballots in early made up for the rest of the votes, with 273 going to Weir.
Shortly after the results were announced Wotherspoon pulled out of the race, although they did not throw their support behind either Meili or Broten.
"Many members have voted, the vast majority have, and I will leave it to the democratic will of the party … I trust our members to make the decision that they will," said Wotherspoon.
The last time NDP members gathered to choose a leader, in 2009, former deputy premier Dwain Lingenfelter got the nod.
However, in the 2011 general election, Lingenfelter lost in their own constituency and the NDP was reduced to nine seats, compared to the Saskatchewan Party's 49.
Regina MLA John Nilson had been serving as interim leader since then.
The only problem is: Einstein may never have uttered the phrase "biggest blunder."
Astrophysicist and author Mario Livio can find no documentation that puts those words into Einstein's mouth (or, for that matter, their pen). Instead, all references eventually lead back to one man, physicist George Gamow, who reported Einstein's use of the phrase in two sources: their posthumously published autobiography My World Line (1970) and a Scientific American article from September 1956.
Screenshot of the 1956 Scientific American article in which Gamow originally recalled Einstein's claim (Scientific American)
This, for reasons Livio recounts in detail in their new book Brilliant Blunders, is some seriously thin sourcing. For one, Gamow, brilliant physicist though they might have been, had a bit of a reputation for, shall we say, antics. Once, for example, Gamow had teamed up with a student of their named Ralph Alpher to write a paper. "He then realized," Livio told me, "that if they were to add as a co-author another known astrophysicist, whose name was Hans Bethe, then the three names would be Alpher Bethe Gamow, like alpha beta gamma, even though Hans Bethe had nothing to do with that paper." (His first wife, Livio writes, once remarked, "In more than twenty years together, Geo has never been happier than when perpetuating a practical joke.")
Knowing this about Gamow made Livio suspicious. What are the chances that Gamow, this ham, was retelling Einstein's confession with veracity? Not good, Livio found.
Livio looked at almost every single paper that Einstein ever wrote, including making a trip to the Einstein archive in Jerusalem to look at the collection personally. "And nowhere did I ever find the phrase 'biggest blunder', " Livio told me. "I didn't find it -- anywhere."
So they turned their attention to the correspondence between Einstein and Gamow, and it is at this point that Gamow's story begins to look even worse. "When might Einstein have used this expression with Gamow?" Livio writes in the book. As Gamow tells it in their autobiography, they and Einstein were quite close, with Gamow visiting the aging scientist every other Friday as the liaison between the Navy and Einstein during World War II. "He describes what good friends they were, how Einstein would greet them in one of their soft sweaters, and so on," Livio explains.
"Well, guess what," they continue. "I discovered a small article published in some obscure journal of the Navy by somebody named Stephen Brunauer," a scientist who had recruited both Einstein and Gamow to the Navy. In that article, Brunauer wrote, "Gamow, in later years, gave the impression that they were the Navy's liaison man with Einstein, that they visited every two weeks, and the professor 'listened' but made no contribution -- all false [emphasis added]. The greatest frequency of visits was mine, and that was about every two months." Clearly, Livio says, Gamow exaggerated their relationship with the famous physicist.
* Kenyan president says militants "defeated"
* Says 5 militants dead, 11 held, 67 other people dead
* Bodies still under rubble of collapsed floors
* Unclear if security operation completely over
* Unclear if British woman, Americans among militants
By Richard Lough and Edmund Blair
NAIROBI, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Kenya's president said on Tuesday that their forces had "defeated" Islamists from Somalia's al Shabaab, had shot five of them dead and detained 11 others suspected of killing 67 people after storming a Nairobi shopping mall.
It remained unclear after Uhuru Kenyatta addressed the nation on television whether the four-day security operation at the upmarket Westgate centre was completely over, or whether any militants were still at large or hostages unaccounted for.
"We have ashamed and defeated our attackers," Kenyatta said, adding that bodies were still trapped under rubble following the collapse of part of the building late in the operation. A fire began on Monday which officials said was started by the gunmen.
Sixty-one civilians and six security personnel had been confirmed killed in the four days of bloodshed, Kenyatta said. Five of the attackers were shot dead and 11 suspects were in custody: "Kenya has stared down evil and triumphed," they said.
The president added that they could not confirm intelligence reports that a British woman and two or three Americans might be involved. Forensic scientists were involved in trying to identify the nationalities of the "terrorists", they said.
"Towards the tail end of the operation, three floors of the Westgate mall collapsed and there are several bodies trapped in the rubble including the terrorists," they added. The death toll had previously been put by officials at 62.
"These cowards will meet justice as will their accomplices and patrons, wherever they are," said the president, who thanked other leaders for support and used their address to both praise the response of the Kenyan people and call for national unity, six months after their election was marked by ethnic tensions.
DEMANDS
Kenyatta had rejected the militants' demands that they pull Kenyan troops out of its northern neighbour. As part of an African peacekeeping force in Somalia, Kenyan forces have pushed al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab on to the defensive over the past two years.
Kenyan officials have announced the imminent end of the siege for the past three days - something al Shabaab spokespersons have mocked in commentaries and in postings on social media.
Some hours before Kenyatta spoke, the group said its militants were still holding out with hostages and that there were "countless dead bodies" still inside the complex.
"There are a countless number of dead bodies still scattered inside the mall, and the Mujahideen are still holding their ground #Westgate," the group said on its Twitter feed.
"The hostages who were being held by the Mujahideen inside #Westgate are still alive, looking quite disconcerted but, nevertheless, alive."
It described its fighters as "unruffled and strolling around the mall in such sangfroid manner".
In an audio statement posted via Twitter, al Shabaab spokesperson Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage called the militants' action a "deadly thrust" by "loyal soldiers seeking to rewrite history". If Kenya failed to pull troops out of Somalia and free al Shabaab prisoners it should "expect black days".
The attack has come at a time when several violent Islamist groups from Mali to Algeria, Nigeria to Kenya - tapping into local grievances but all espousing an anti-Western, anti-Christian creed - are striking at state authority and international interests.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Kenyan military said its forces were carrying out "mop up operations" in the building.
The Interior Ministry earlier said security forces were in control of the mall and that all the hostages had been released.
Images from closed-circuit television inside the mall during the attack, published in a Kenyan newspaper on Tuesday, showed two militants, casually dressed and wearing ammunition belts. One held an assault rifle. Al Shabaab confirmed that the two men were part of the group that attacked Westgate.
Kenyan Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed told PBS television in the United States that "two or three Americans" and a British woman were among the militants.
They said the Americans were "young men, about between maybe 18 and 19" years old. They said they were of Somali or Arab origin and had lived in "in Minnesota and one other place".
Al Shabaab, which said it had been in communication with its members in the mall, dismissed the minister's comments.
"Those who describe the attackers as Americans and British are people who do not know what is going on in Westgate building," al Shabaab's media office told Reuters.
"WHITE WIDOW?"
A British security source said it was possible that Samantha Lewthwaite, the widow of Germaine Lindsay, one of the suicide bombers who killed more than 50 people on London's transport system in 2005, was involved in the Nairobi siege.
When asked about reports that Lewthwaite, dubbed the "white widow" by the British media, was directly involved in the attack in Kenya, the source said: "It is a possibility. But nothing definitive or conclusive yet."
Lewthwaite is thought to have left Britain several years ago and is wanted in connection with an alleged plot to attack hotels and restaurants in Kenya.
U.S. security sources said they were looking into information from Kenya that residents of Western countries, including the United States, may have been among the militants.
U.S. President Barack Obama, whose father was born in the east African nation, offered help, saying they believed Kenya - the scene of one of al Qaeda's first major attacks, in 1998, and a neighbour of chaotic Somalia - would continue to be a regional pillar of stability.
Somalia's prime minister appealed in Geneva on Tuesday for international support to combat al Shabaab but said a military solution to their insurgency alone was not enough.
Abdi Farah Shirdon said: "We still have a difficult journey ahead of us. A military solution alone is not enough, promotion of rule of law, greater regional cooperation and economic stability and provision of public services are all key factors that complement the military effort."
The attack on the mall is the worst such incident in Kenya since al Qaeda killed more than 200 people when it bombed the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998.
When fighters from its Somali ideological counterpart stormed the mall on Saturday, they hit a high-profile symbol of Kenya's economic power.
Kenya has sent troops to Somalia as part of an African Union force trying to stabilise the country, which was long without a functioning government, and push back al Shabaab.
It has also suffered internal instability. President Kenyatta, who lost a nephew in the weekend bloodbath, faces charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court for their alleged role in coordinating violence after disputed elections in 2007. They deny the charges.
British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said they believed six Britons had died in the attack. Other known foreign victims are from China, Ghana, France, the Netherlands and Canada. Kenyan officials said the total death toll was at least 62.
Conflicting comments have fuelled speculation about the attackers' identity. While the foreign minister said there was a woman attacker killed, Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku had said on Monday they were all men but some had dressed as women.

Conservatives claim Obamacare is a socialist boondoggle that will bloat the federal government. Ironically, state and local governments claim Obamacare is making them tighten their belts.
Part-time public-sector workers like substitute teachers, prison guards, and police dispatchers risk having their hours cut in an effort by state and local governments to dodge the Affordable Care Act's "employer mandate" to give such workers health benefits, the New York Times reports.
“Our choice was to cut the hours or give them health care, and we could not afford the latter,” Dennis Hanwell, the Republican mayor of Medina, Ohio, told the NYT, referring to city employees.
Under President Obama's signature health-care reform law, employers are required to provide insurance for part-time employees working more than 30 hours per week. Many government employers say they simply can't afford it, according to the NYT, and plan to limit worker hours to 29 per week instead.
Some private-sector employers have also threatened to cut part-time workers' hours in an effort to skirt the health-care law. Companies such as Regal Entertainment and Olive Garden parent company Darden Restaurants, as well as certain small business owners, claim to have looked to cutting worker hours as a way of reducing health-care costs.
Still, Obamacare's "employer mandate" doesn't actually take effect until next year. Even then, it will not apply to all employers. And the Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office and other analysts consistently report that there is no evidence Obamacare is increasing part-time work in any measurable way.
The public sector, however, might have fewer options for making up the costs of expanding health coverage compared to private businesses, who might be able to pass those costs on to the consumer.
“We cannot go out and raise the price of our product to assist us,” Les Huddle, superintendent of the Lafayette School Corporation, told the Courier-Journal last June.
Public-sector workers, such as adjunct professors at community colleges, for example, could feel twofold pain from their hours getting cut.
Around Tuesday morning, Amazon Prime Video accidentally released in India, a reddit post pointed out. The release was probably unintentional, since the service was only accessible through the Android app, which is not available on Google Play in India yet. The app now throws up an error and the catalogue is inaccessible.
MediaNama accessed the app and browsed the catalogue over the day, and this is what we found:
Catalogue
Amazon has several titles in Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu; there was also a relatively limited number of English-language films. The service also featured quite a few major features, like Sultan, Kabali, Kapoor & Sons, Rock On!!, and Fan. There were also some smaller critical hits like Titli, Citylights, and the restored version of Kamal Swaroop's 1988 surreal film Om-Dar-B-Dar, which has not had a home video release after its theatrical debut in 2014.
Surprisingly, the catalogue didn't seem to have all Amazon Originals. Love & Friendship, the Amazon Studios period drama, was unavailable; this is presumably because Amazon Studios only bought rights for North America distribution. Recent originals like The Grand Tour and Woody Allen's Transparent were available.
Among the American TV shows on the service were Seinfeld, Supernatural, Vampire Diaries, The Originals, Preacher, Mad Men, NCIS, and Fear The Walking Dead. Japanese anime shows included Doraemon, Shinchan, and Ninja Hattori, as announced by Amazon last week.
There were very few Indian TV series on the service–one available show was CID. Amazon has announced that it will release original Indian series in the future.
Censorship
All Indian titles MediaNama accessed were censored, including films like Om-Dar-B-Dar and Titli, both of which have run into trouble with the censor board in the past. CBFC certificates were prominently shown before every Indian film.
TV shows and non-Indian films were left intact.
Amazon's censorship approach seems to be a hybrid of TV-on-demand services like iTunes and Google, and that of Netflix. Netflix currently doesn't censor any titles for India as a policy, while the Play Store and iTunes' library are completely censored for both Indian and non-Indian titles.
Localisation
Amazon seems to have invested quite a bit in subtitling and dubbing its content. In addition to children's shows, multiple American series and films have captioning and dubbing in Indian languages. Fear The Walking Dead, for example, has been dubbed into Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Bengali.
Additionally, all nine seasons of Seinfeld have Hindi subtitles.
Overall
Prime Video seems to have a pretty voluminous catalogue in Indian languages, and a notably strong slate of originals. Its localisation is admirable, especially for extending captioning and dubbing efforts to TV series, something few players, if any, in India has done before.
There's still a lot left to be desired when it comes to the acquisition of smaller Indian titles, something Netflix has done more extensively over the last year.
All hope is not lost for those who are in a hurry to see The Grand Tour, though–the series is available for Indian Prime subscribers to view on Prime Video US.

We recently reported on the announcement of Firmcoin, a reprogrammable physical bitcoin token. This can be thought of as an option between Bitbills or Casascius coins and the Trezor hardware wallet. The amount that it carries is not fixed, but it's cheap enough to be exchanged as a physical token. We spoke to the man behind Firmcoin, Sergio Lerner to find out more.
Q. What is your background and training in?
SL: I was an assistant teacher in Cryptography at University of Buenos Aires. I have a Masters in Computer Science, and my thesis was on advances in Cryptography in Mental Poker protocols. I hold four patents on cryptographic apparatus and methods. I worked more than fifteen years in computer security and code breaking, both for the private sector and for the Argentinian government. I write about crypto in my blog (bitslog.wordpress.com). I received two awards in computer security contests hosted by CORE Security Technologies. I received two medals and four awards in international algorithm competitions (IOI/ACM).
Nevertheless, since I'm human I can make mistakes and that's why all Firmcoin protocols/code will be open for anyone to review.
Q. For first-time readers, would you please give a layperson explanation of what Firmcoin is?
SL: Firmcoins are the evolution of banknotes. For all that matters to common people, they have the same properties as paper money. The idea is that you will use a Firmcoin in any context where you would prefer using a banknote over a credit card. To pay for an item, you give the Firmcoins.
The main difference between paying with a Firmcoin and paying with your smartphone using a wallet application is that Firmcoin transactions are offline. You don't need an Internet connection, and it's even possible to accept Firmcoins with confidence without having a computer. They are anonymous, as much as banknotes can be (the banknote serial number could be used to track them, but there's not much an attacker can learn). Both banknotes and Firmcoins have security measures to prove their authenticity. In a banknote, you have physical countermeasures to prevent counterfeiting. Firmcoins have both physical and logical measures to prevent counterfeiting.
Firmcoins have an extraordinary additional property:
You can transfer coins from the Firmcoin to your bitcoin wallet back and forth without going to a bank or a trader. That makes them the most private bitcoin transfer system ever made.
– Unlike banknotes that hold bacteria, Firmcoins are nice-looking, crystal clear, 100% cleanable, geeky devices you will love to hold.
– There are two versions of Firmcoins: one holds only a fixed amount of bitcoin and the other can hold variable amounts of money, showing the amount in a nice e-paper display.
– The issuer of the Firmcoins need not be a bank, or a money transmitter, nor is it currently regulated in any other way (as far as I know).
– A Firmcoin can hold certifications of authenticity created from other entities, to increase even more the confidence in the device.
Q. How does this differ from the other physical representations of bitcoin?
SL: Most of the answers can be found on the Why? page on the Firmcoin website. However, Bitbills may be cheaper, but they are for one-time use, so you have to add the cost of wasted notes. Also, Bitbills are sold holding some BTC (they cannot be loaded by the buyer), so the Bitbill issuer may be regarded by governments as money transmitters/issuers, so they may try to regulate them, which would be overkill for the Bitbill cost.
Q. Why do you think there is a need for physical bitcoins?
SL: First, people love nice-looking physical objects. The first day I uploaded the Firmcoin.com webpage, people started asking me to sell them Firmcoins to give as gifts.
Second, as I said before, there are many contexts where either a computer/smartphone is not available:
– You may be too drunk to operate a hardware wallet properly!
– If you're in a dangerous place you may not want to have a smartphone with you that can be used (by extortion) to steal all your money in your account.
– You may be in Argentina, where merchants often cannot process credit cards or any electronic payment system because the network is down.
– You may be in the middle of the desert without a cellphone signal.
– You may want to give bitcoins to a friend that does not have a bitcoin account, nor understand how to use a bitcoin wallet application.
– You may want to buy something completely anonymously.
Q. Since Firmcoins are reprogrammable, could they be used for altcurrencies?
SL: Yes, they are designed to hold any kind of digitally transferable asset; any asset you can transfer by signing with a digital signature. They could even be used to hold fiat currencies, if governments decide that it is better to manufacture Firmcoins over banknotes because of counterfeit security, wear cost, public health, reduced cost of transport (since they can be turned online at any time), cost of acceptance (because it may be easier to check the authenticity of a Firmcoin over a banknote), etc.
I think that in fifty years, if physical money still exists, then they will all be Firmcoins. I was pleased to discover that in the futuristic online game Shadowrun, there exists a physical device called a credstick that behaves in some ways very much like Firmcoins (see http://firmcoin.com/?p=66).
Q. Would current Firmcoins require a significant modification to hold alternative types of data?
SL: Generally no, but it depends on the cryptographic algorithms required to sign the other types of data. Bitcoin uses ECDSA for signatures, and that's what we've implemented on the Firmcoin. Most cryptocurrencies are clones of bitcoin and so use the same signing scheme. If another cryptocurrency requires, for example, RSA signatures, then new firmware with RSA signing functions would be necessary to develop and program into the device.
Nevertheless, if you take out the functions that require signing and key generation, you can actually use the Firmcoin to store any piece of private data you wish (provided you load the device only from a trusted third party).
Q. Will a special smartphone app be needed to read and write to Firmcoins?
SL: Currently yes.
Our app can:
– query the Firmcoin for funds;
– download its private key;
– take a photo of the Firmcoin and compare it with a portable image database;
– request the device to prove the possession of a private key;
– check that the device has funds by searching the funding transactions in a portable UTXO set (the set of spendable coins);
– ask the device to generate a new private key;
– load funds into the key using a block-chain branch;
– request a certification party to provide fund certifications for the Firmcoin public key and load the certifications into the Firmcoin;
– verify the authenticity of the firmware, and some other cool things.
Q. Firmcoins communicate with the world via Near Field Communication (NFC). NFC is not standard in all smartphones. Most notably, the iPhone does not have NFC. How much of a problem do you see this as being for adoption of Firmcoin?
SL: I'm not a futurologist, but I'm sure that NFC is here to stay. It's just a matter of time until the iPhone will include an NFC reader. The most notable aspect of NFC technology is that NFC tags are passive (without batteries) and can be powered from the NFC reader, so they can be really cheap. A portable NFC reader with another communication interface to a smartphone costs so little that you can convert any smartphone in an NFC-enabled device.
Q. Your blog says you're going to Kickstarter for funding – is this your only source of funding?
SL: Currently I'm being self-funded by my company Certimix. Next week I'm meeting investors, so Kickstarter is just an option we are considering.
Q. Do you think having physical bitcoins will help mainstream adoption?
SL: Physical (electronic) bitcoins are much more expensive than banknotes. A dollar bill costs approximately 5 cents to produce in a batch of 10 billion, where a Firmcoin could cost $4 (in 1K batches). So Firmcoins are not ready to replace bills in all context. Nevertheless, if one could manufacture Firmcoins in larger batches, the cost will go down, and also the cost of technology goes down very rapidly over time.
The key for success of Firmcoins is that they are cheap enough to let people pay with them without thinking about the cost of the device. If you're paying 1 BTC, then 0.03 BTC (the cost of a Firmcoin at 100 USD/BTC) is only 3% of the transaction cost, which can be regarded as the fee of an anonymous transaction and ignored.
Nevertheless, there are several possibilities to help people give the Firmcoins away without worries:
– Accept the same amount of empty Firmcoins in return of the payment. For example, if I pay you 100 BTC using 4 Firmcoins of 25 BTC each, you give me back 4 empty Firmcoins to cover the costs of the devices given to you.
– Accept the same amount of a different (cheaper to manufacture) physical device that represents the cost of a Firmcoin. For example, you could receive one bitbill-like note for each Firmcoin given as payment. Or you could receive dollars for the cost of the Firmcoins.
– If the payee has a smartphone connected to the Internet, they can give me back the cost of the Firmcoins used in the off-line transaction using a normal online transaction. Since the Firmware cost is low, the payer does not need to carry a smartphone to verify the transaction and may just trust the payee's smartphone.
So people should like the Firmcoins, but not too much they get attached to them!
Q. When do you expect to ship Firmcoins to customers?
SL: I have no idea. I started the project for fun, and I got a lot of interest immediately. I've been reached by investors without even asking for funds, and still only have a few prototypes to show. I suppose that with hard work and some capital I could start manufacturing in medium volumes in three months.
I'm not in a hurry to go to the market. I want the Firmcoin to stand up against people's expectations. I've applied for patents for some of the functions/methods and physical properties of the Firmcoin so I can have some time to do things well.
“Don't think I will forget. There is no time left. You didn't understand what I am. I am love, I am pleasure, I am essence, I am an idiot, I am an alcoholic, I am tenacious, I am a painter. I am, I simply am. What are you then that I must bear your offences? To continue being the idiot believing your crap and accepting you are a god. You are a god, pretending to be a pagan deity. Keep your filthy life. You are a shit.”
Frida Kahlo penned these words in an unsent letter to their unfaithful husband, artist Diego Rivera, and they open a window into their soul.  They are the idiot, the painter, and the woman who lived and loved deeply. Them brushes and paints were a refuge against the existential lashings of life.
The wealth of opinions surrounding Frida has transformed them into a central character in popular culture. Them Blue House nestled in the heart of the Pre-Hispanic neighborhood Coyoacan has become synonymous of their unibrow, delicate hands holding a cigar, and their chest cast that served as a canvas. Not far from this property, we find another home where they found love and heartbreak, and where a soviet refugee discovered Mexico's most prized treasure: Leon Trotsky's Museum.
There are multiple roads one can take to discover Kahlo. In their paintings and letters, they deposited all of their emotions, experiences, and thoughts on the reality that surrounded them Them recipes were a fusion of Mexican gastronomy and the surrealist life they led. There is another route we can take, through the lens of photographers.
The photographs of Frida Kahlo take us back to a Mexico lost under the pressure of modernity. The decades of the thirties and forties show a country escaping its violent destiny, licking its wounds after a bloody revolution, a country where art was the glue that helped create a unified nation. Them portraits connect us with their life, their joys, and sufferings. Some of their photographs are ingrained in the public psyche, while others are hidden gems showing a Frida never seen before.

AUBURN, Ala. -- Auburn defensive linemen Nick Coe and Big Kat Bryant were both named to the Freshman All-SEC team, which was voted on by the coaches and released Thursday.
Coe played in all 13 games for Auburn this season and has 29 tackles, 4.5 tackles for loss, two sacks and six quarterback hurries. The redshirt first-year student twice earned SEC first-year student of the week honor and was also named the SEC defensive lineman of the week for their efforts in the Iron Bowl where they had five tackles, a sack and a quarterback hurry.
Bryant, a true first-year student who didn't arrive on campus until this past summer, played in 11 games and finished with five tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss, two sacks and a forced fumble. Both sacks came against SEC opponents.
Last year, defensive end Marlon Davidson and cornerback Javaris Davis represented Auburn on the Freshman All-SEC team.
The opportunity for Anaheim Ducks forward Kyle Palmieri was as obvious as the writing on the lineup card for Game 3 of the Western Conference Quarterfinal playoff series against the Detroit Red Wings. They were listed as the left wing on the top line, alongside the team's franchise players, Ryan Getzlaf and Corey Perry.
Though they had 10:30 of ice time in that game, could it have been a bit of foreshadowing?
There's a big hole on the left side of the Ducks' top line following the trade of Bobby Ryan, who was shipped to the Ottawa Senators in July. Palmieri, selected No. 26 in the 2009 NHL Draft, could be the player coach Bruce Boudreau picks to fill that spot on a full-time basis.
Palmieri, 22, received their largest taste of NHL action last season, playing 42 games, and they responded with 10 goals, including five game-winners. He's split the past three seasons between the Ducks and the American Hockey League, but they look poised to make the jump to permanent NHL player.
"At the end [of the season], they played very well," Ducks general manager Bob Murray told NHL.com. "It was unfortunate for a lot of players who had put in a couple years in the minors and they had to spend the beginning part of the [2012-13 season] in the minors. People don't understand how hard that is. It's hard to get yourself motivated. Once they got to the [NHL], they were excited and ready to go. They played very well."
Boudreau rewarded Palmieri's solid play with short stints alongside the Ducks' top-line duo during particular games, but starting there in a Stanley Cup Playoff game made a major statement.
"We were always looking for someone to play with those two," Murray said. "Kyle handled it very well. They got a few opportunities to play there. Bruce is very good with the young players, and putting [Palmieri] in a position of playing their off-wing, we like them very much offensively on their off-wing, but we want to be fair to them defensively on the off-wing and we don't know if we've given them enough opportunity to grow used to playing left wing all the time in their own zone. Playoff games are critical; little mistakes inside your own blue line. Bruce moved them in and out of there and Kyle acquitted themselves very well."

Short stints on the top line are one thing, but with Ryan's departure in the summer, there's a full-time job available. However, it won't just be handed to Palmieri. Veteran Dustin Penner was signed as a free agent, and Murray said reuniting the Ducks' second line from the 2007 Stanley Cup championship season went into the decision to bring back Penner. Rookie Emerson Etem is coming off a solid season; Jakob Silfverberg, who came from Ottawa as part of the Ryan trade, is coming off a strong first NHL season; and physical forward Matt Beleskey could be an option.
"Kyle will fight for that," Murray said. "I fully expect Emerson Etem to come into camp. He's going to get an opportunity there. And we just signed Dustin Penner, who had great success playing there before. Competition is healthy, and we have lots of it going on."
But Palmieri got a big chance there in the spring and could be the first to get a shot there in the fall.
"He's pushing a lot of positions and a lot of spots," Murray said. "Kyle, I can just sense they wanted it badly and I hope they show up in the same frame of mind this year."

The Orioles are planning on making a qualifying offer to Nelson Cruz and decline their half of a $17.5MM option on Nick Markakis in favor of a $2MM buyout, according to Jon Heyman of CBS Sports.
The Cruz decision has been evident for quite some time, given the slugger's MLB-leading 40 homers and strong .271/.333/.525 batting line. Cruz struggled in the wake of a qualifying offer from the Rangers last offseason, ultimately settling for a one-year, $8MM contract with Baltimore. While many contend that the qualifying offer crushed their market — and that's certainly part of the reason for their struggles — Cruz also hit the open market with sky-high expectations in 2013, reportedly seeking as much as $75MM in the early-going. Had they been open to signing for less, a strong multi-year offer may have been on the table. However, now that he's coming off such a strong season that put more separation between them and a suspension for performance enhancing drugs, he's a lock to turn down that QO and in a much better position to land a strong multi-year deal.
The Markakis decision could have gone either way, in my mind, but the decision to decline their option seems to indicate that they won't be on the receiving end of a QO of their own. The Orioles, in theory, could have exercised their half of the option in hopes of Markakis declining his, then made a qualifying offer, assuming that a player at their age and with their track record wouldn't want to play on a one-year deal. I thought that to be the likely outcome prior to Heyman's report.
However, declining the option suggests that they're not interested in paying them $17.5MM, which is nearly the exact amount that the buyout plus a qualifying offer of $15.3MM would total. It's possible that Baltimore will still extend the QO in order to have saved roughly $200K in the event that Markakis accepts, but that would be a very peculiar route to take with someone who is so respected within the organization. The likely outcome now seems to be that they won't cost a draft pick this offseason, which should dramatically improve their free agent stock.
The O's have a large number of arbitration eligible players, including Chris Tillman, Zach Britton, Chris Davis, Matt Wieters and Bud Norris, so their arb-eligibles will inflate their payroll substantially. Because of that, it's possible that the Orioles simply felt that they couldn't fit both Markakis and Cruz into their 2015 budget, and their preference is to position themselves more strongly to retain Cruz's power. The 30-year-old Markakis certainly didn't have a poor season himself, however, as they hit .276/.342/.386 with 14 homers and right-field defense that graded out favorably from a metrics standpoint.
They are well loved for their immaculate fluffy coats and unique personalities but new research suggests cats do have a much darker side.
A study carried out between the University of Edinburgh and Bronx Zoo compared our beloved domestic cat with its wilder relatives.
Compared with the snow leopard, the Scottish wildcat and the African lion, researchers found these larger predators shared similar characteristics of aggression and neurotic behaviour to domestic cats.

A study carried out between the University of Edinburgh and Bronx Zoo compared our beloved domestic cat with its wilder relatives
Dominance, impulsiveness and neurotic behaviour are the most common trait shared between the domestic cat and the wild cat.
The researchers used a testing method known as the 'Big Five' personality test: Openness to Experience, Extraversion/Introversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism.
A total of 100 cats, from two different shelters in Scotland were used in the experiment, whilst the other animals were examined from zoos and animal sanctuaries in the UK and USA.
'They're cute and furry and cuddly, but we need to remember when we have cats as pets, we are inviting little predators into our house,' psychologist Dr. Max Wachtel told 9NEWS.
Predators: Researchers have examined the traits of 100 domestic cats and compared them with leopards
African lions from two different zoos in the UK and the USA were examined as part of the experiment
'For a lot of people, it is worth it. Cats can be fantastic, sweet companions. Until they turn on you.'
Only their size prevents the cat from being able to unleash its full predatory qualities.
Suddenly, it seems, every application and cloud service has been fortified with machine learning or artificial intelligence. Presto! They now can do magic.
Much of the marketing around machine learning and AI is misleading, making promises that aren't realistic—and often using the terms when they don't apply. In other words, there's a lot of BS being peddled. Don't fall for those snow jobs.
Before I explain how can you tell if the software or service really uses machine learning or AI, let me define what those terms really mean:
Artificial intelligence is a wide range of cognitive technologies to enable ad hoc or situational reasoning, planning, learning, communication, perception, and the ability manipulate objects to an intended purpose. These technologies in various combinations promise to create machines or software entities that have—or at least act as if they have—the natural intelligence that humans and other animal species possess. Just as natural life's intelligence varies dramatically across and within species, so too could the intelligence of AIs.
AI has been a popular motif in science fiction for more than a century, and it's a particularly strong notion among techies. IBM, MIT, the U.S. Defense Department, and Carnegie-Mellon University, for example, have been doing AI work for decades, showcasing the same kinds of examples over and over again for just as long. The promises today are very much like the promise I saw at these institutions in the 1980s, but of course there's been a lot of incremental improvement that has brought us a little closer to making the promises a reality. But we're nowhere the scenarios of sci-fi.
Machine learning is a subset of AI. It refers specifically to software designed to detect patterns and observe outcomes, then use that analysis to adjust its own behavior or guide people to better results. Machine learning doesn't require the kind of perception and cognition that we associate with intelligence; it simply requires really good, really fast pattern matching and the ability to apply those patterns to its behavior and recommendations. Humans and other animals learn the same way: You see what works and do that more often, while avoiding what you observe doesn't work so well. A machine, by contrast, does only what it is told or programmed to do.
Snow job 1: Confusing logic with learning
There've been a lot of advances in machine learning in recent years, so not all machine learning claims are snow jobs. The quick way to tell is to ask the vendor what the software or robot can learn and adjust on its own, without a software update. Plus, ask how you train it; training is how you help it learn your environment and desired outcomes.
But most of what marketers call machine learning is simply logic. Programmers have been using logic in software since Day 1 to tell programs and robots what to do. Sophisticated logic can provide multiple paths for the software or robot to take, based on parameters the logic is designed to process.
Today's hardware can run very sophisticated logic, so applications and devices can appear to be intelligent and able to adjust on their own. But most don't actually learn—if their developer didn't anticipate a situation, they can't adjust on their own to handle it through pattern-analysis-based trial and error as a true machine learning system can.
Even if true machine learning is in place, a machine learning system is bound by whatever parameters its logic has set it to “know”—unlike a true AI, it can't discover new facts outside its programmed world, only learn to understand and interact with the programmed world on its own.
Snow job 2: The use of IoT or cloud technology makes it smart
Marketers like to take hot technology terms and sprinkle them on whatever they already have. Many don't really understand what the terms mean, or they don't care. They only want your attention. You can identify a snow job quickly by looking at the buzzword-to-detail ratio: If all you see are buzzwords and the technology “how” details are lacking, you know it's the same old technology with new marketing applied.
Today, the internet of things and cloud computing are hot, so they're often at the heart of that new marketing. Still, both can play a role in machine learning or AI systems (really, AI precursor systems), so it's not the use of the terms that's a red flag, but their flippant use.
IoT relies on both local and networked sensors and on a combination of local and server (cloud) logic—both analytics and actuators to do something from the analysis. Together, these allow devices to seem smart because they're programmed to adjust automatically to various events they sense. For machine learning, they are great inputs for the learning part, as well as great outputs for the adjusted actions.
Cloud computing opens up processing and data storage capabilities undreamt of in the past. Devices don't have to carry all that overhead with them; instead, they can offload to the cloud all that work—and the hardware to support it. This is how Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, and Google Now work: They send your speech to the cloud, which translates it and figures out a response, then sends it back to your phone. That way, you don't have to carry a mainframe or datacenter on your pocket or keep it on your desk.
Of course, you could do that before the cloud via client/server computing, but the cloud provides at least an order of magnitude more capability than your typical datacenter, so now you can do processing and storage at the scale that whole populations can take advantage of.
Snow job 3: Machine learning means it's smart
It's truly impressive what a service like Siri, Cortana, or Google Now can do. And what developers can do using tools like Microsoft's Bot Framework with Cortana. But we all quickly see how they fall apart in areas outside their programming, resorting to a simple web search for what they weren't programmed to learn. No doubt Apple, Microsoft, and Google are using machine learning on the back end to make them appear smarter.
If someone claims an application, a service, or a machine is smart, you're almost certainly getting snowed. Of course, people will use the word “smart” as a shortcut to mean “more capable logic,” a phrase that won't sell anything. But if they don't explain what “smart” means specific to their offering, you know they think you're dumb.
The fact is that most technologies labeled “smart” are not smart, merely savvy. The difference is that smart requires intelligence and cognition, whereas savvy requires only information and the ability to take advantage of it (it's no accident that “savvy” come from the French word for “to know”). A savvy app or robot is a good thing, but it's still not smart. We're simply not there yet.
Even IBM's vaunted Watson is not smart. It is savvy, it is very fast, and it can learn. But it's been around in various forms at IBM since the 1980s, so if Watson were truly that smart, IBM would be ruling the business world by now. Watson won't cure diseases, make peace in the Mideast, create new tax breaks, or solve world hunger. But it can help people better handle all sorts of actions, if the price is right.
If you keep that goal in mind and are truly getting machine learning and AI precursors in your business, you'll be satisfied. But don't expect a sci-fi fantasy version like Data from Star Trek, HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey (inspired by IBM's 1960s AI research!), or Philip K. Dick's androids in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? And don't trust vendors that sell their technology under such guises.
US Dollar Crisis Not Oil Crisis
It's unfortunate that the Supreme Court, in its ruling this week that U.S. currency is unfair to the blind, did not make the next logical step and declare it unfair to everyone who buys gasoline.
In their search for explanations as to why oil has surged past $130 per barrel, Washington, Wall Street, and the financial media are as clueless as cavemen after a freak summer snow storm.
Despite the head scratching, the blame game is nevertheless in full force. Speculators and big oil companies are being trotted out as scapegoats, and increased margin requirements and taxes on windfall profits and futures trading have been mentioned as appropriate sanctions. It should be clear that this is pure farce, and that no one understands what is actually happening.
The reality is that after years of reckless consumption and dollar debasement, Americans are now being priced out of markets over which they formerly held unchallenged title. As more affluent foreigners consume more of the resources and products they previously supplied to us, Americans are being forced to cut back. The rising dollar-based price of gasoline is simply an illustration of this global trend.
Poorly concealed behind contrived government statistics, the signs of America's falling standard of living are everywhere; all one has to do is look. We are unloading SUVs for less desirable compacts, and are paying more to fly on crowded planes (where we pay to check luggage and dine only on what we bring onboard). We drink our lattes at McDonald's or not at all, and we increasingly forego dining out, trips to the mall, and vacations, just so we can scrape together enough to fill our gas tanks and kitchen pantries, pay taxes and insurance, or make credit card, mortgage or car payments.
The collective belt tightening is simply the down payment on the Government's massive bailout of Wall Street investment banks and mortgage lenders. As the Fed creates money to buy bad mortgages and other shaky securities held by banks and brokerage firms, the value of the savings and wages of everyone on Main Street will continue to fall. As a result, the costs of products previously taken for granted have begun to bite.
The various housing bills and stimulus packages now passing through Congress will add significantly to the staggering final price tag. In the end, the “free lunch” currently being dished out by Washington will be the most expensive meal ever served. The cost will be borne by ordinary Americans citizens every time they open their wallets. Four dollar gasoline is just the beginning.
For all the talk of increased global demand, few seem to understand from where it actually comes. The surge in global demand is both a function of the increased purchasing power of foreign currencies and the fact that foreigners are choosing to spend more of their incomes themselves. In other words Greenspan's famous “global savings glut” is turning into a global consumption binge, with Americans unable to crash the party. This trend will only get worse as the dollar-denominated price of just about everything that is either imported, or capable of being exported, goes through the roof.
We can look for scapegoats all we want but the simple fact is Americans are going to have to get used to a much lower standard of living. Those who have been putting all the food on our tables are finally pulling up chairs themselves.

The commander of Fort Meade promised to review security after a man driving a stolen car barreled through a guarded checkpoint Wednesday night, crashed through a fence onto the campus of the National Security Agency and evaded law enforcement officers for more than 13 hours.
"We will investigate fully this incident, how it occurred, to determine if we can make any procedural changes," Col. Brian Foley told reporters Thursday outside the main gate to the installation in Anne Arundel County.
"It has been my priority the entire tenure I've been in this job to improve the access control points, the physical security ... on this installation."
The man, identified as Dante Small, 41, of Hagerstown eventually was apprehended "without incident" about 10:15 a.m. Thursday, according to police and Army officials.
Foley said Small had hidden in a storm drain. They were arrested almost immediately after poking their head out.
With 53,000 service members, civilians and contractors, Fort Meade is the state's largest workplace. Officials put the installation on lockdown Wednesday night, and closed Meade High School, two middle schools and three primary schools on Thursday morning. Foley directed all but essential personnel to stay away.

The incident comes as officials have put military bases on heightened alert because of terrorism concerns.
Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, whose district includes Fort Meade, called the incident "a serious security breach."
"Suppose this guy was a terrorist and had a bomb," the Baltimore County Democrat said. "We have to see whether the resources were there and whether people trained to protect the perimeter were doing their job."
No charges had been filed against Small as of Thursday evening, Baltimore police said and they were being treated at a hospital. Officials said they could face federal trespassing charges and traffic charges.
The incident began when Anne Arundel County police attempted to stop a car near Arundel Mills Boulevard about 8:45 p.m. Wednesday, officials said. The car had been reported stolen from a man in Federal Hill, according to Baltimore police.
Officials said Small led officers in at least two cars on a 41/2-mile chase before they crashed into a fence at Rockenbach Road that separates the NSA campus from the rest of Fort Meade. Aerial footage from TV station WUSA showed a section of chain-link fence near a wooded area knocked to the ground.
Small jumped from the vehicle and fled on foot, Foley said. They ducked into the storm drain, which was concealed by a bush, on the NSA side of the fence, Foley said.
Military police from Fort Meade and other installations, Baltimore police, Anne Arundel County police and Maryland State Police hunted for Small in the dark. Neighbors reported hearing helicopters in the area, and Anne Arundel police deployed dogs.
At 4 a.m., Foley decided that only essential personnel should come in to work at the base Thursday morning.
Small emerged from the drain shortly after 10 a.m., officials said, and was taken into custody by Baltimore police.
"He probably thought enough time had gone by and it was safe to come out," Foley said.
The car, a 2008 silver Acura TSX sedan, was reported stolen in Federal Hill on Sunday night, Baltimore police said.
A man told police they were robbed at gunpoint after parking their car in the 1000 block of Covington St., according to a police report.
They told officers they were approached by three unknown men, according to the report. One had a handgun, and one asked him, "What you got in your pockets?"
When the victim told them they had nothing, they demanded their keys and the victim handed them over, according to the report. They walked back to their house and called police.
It was unknown whether Small was one of the three men involved in the robbery Sunday.
Fort Meade is home to U.S. Cyber Command, the NSA, the Defense Information Systems Agency, the Defense Information School and members of all branches of the military.
In March, officials said, two people rammed a gate at Fort Meade that leads directly to the NSA. NSA Police officers opened fire, killing the driver and wounding the passenger.
Foley was asked Thursday why officers at the gate Wednesday night did not fire on the Acura when it crossed the perimeter.
They said the circumstances were different. In March, they said, the officers believed their lives were in danger. They declined to comment further, saying the incident remained under review.
The FBI and local police declined to file charges in the March incident.

FORT WORTH, Texas— America's most expensive weapons system ever built is on track for "initial combat use" by September 2016.
Business Insider recently toured Lockheed Martin's massive production facility in Fort Worth, Texas, where the three F-35 Lightning II variant aircraft are designed and manufactured.
The $400 billion and counting F-35 program has so far delivered 140 of the anticipated 2,443 jets to the US Department of Defense and five aircraft to foreign military buyers.
Here is a look at the unique capabilities of the F-35 variant aircraft:
Lockheed Martin/Amanda Macias/Business Insider
The lightest of the jets is the F-35A:

The F-35B is in the middle at 14.3 feet tall and weighs 32,300 pounds.
The F-35C is the tallest and the heaviest:

The F-35A and F-35B have the same wingspan and nearly the same length:

Designed for the Navy, the F-35C features longer wings to create drag for the jet to slowly land on aircraft carriers:

The F-35C has another unique wing design:

The F-35A is the only variant that has an internal gun; aside from that, the jets have similar designs:

The F-35 jets have serious firepower:
The F-35C carries 19,750 pounds of fuel, the most fuel of the variant aircraft. All jets have the capability to be refueled in air:

SEATTLE — It is a season for giving and, according to law enforcement officials in Washington County, Ore., taking as well.
Two weeks ago, its Sheriff's Office ran a sting operation to catch porch pirates, thieves who swipe packages from Amazon and other companies from doorsteps. Detectives from the department's property crimes unit put several electronics items worth more than $500 in a box, dropped in a tracking device and “baited” a volunteer's front porch in the town of Aloha.
Sure enough, a pirate struck just after 2 a.m., and deputies traced them to a home two blocks away. In an apparent effort to cover up their deed, the 27-year-old suspect microwaved the tracking device, so they were charged with evidence tampering in addition to theft.
Porch pirates have darkened people's doorsteps for years. Law enforcement agencies say they think the crime is on the rise, along with the growth of online shopping. “There are more packages for them to grab,” said Angela Sands, a spokesperson for the Police Department in Lincoln, Neb.
It may sound warm and fuzzy, but deer antler velvet is at the center of a new sports controversy involving Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis.
Lewis, who's headed to the Superbowl in New Orleans this weekend, looked into using a nasal spray made of deer antler velvet to heal their torn right triceps, Sports Illustrated reported in their February 4 issue. Lewis denies the story, calling the rumor a "trick of the devil," according to USA Today.
Made from male deer antlers during the stage when the antlers are covered in soft fuzz, the unproven performance enhancer is often used by athletes who believe it helps heal cartilage and tendon injuries more quickly and boosts strength and endurance.
However, it's not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and is banned by the National Football League.
Even so, it's a big business, especially in New Zealand, a major exporter of deer velvet, which ships tens of millions of dollars worth of the substance to Asia and the U.S. each year, according to the New York University Langone Medical Center.
Deer farming is a huge industry in the country, with about 2,800 farmers that own approximately 1.1 million deer, most of them red deer, elk, and red deer-elk hybrids, according to the company New Zealand Deer Velvet.
Before removing the velvet from a stag's antlers, certified veterinarians or farmers give the animal stag a local anesthetic to minimize stress.
We asked a few medical experts to give us the facts on deer antler velvet.
What Is It?
Deer antler velvet is essentially a growth hormone called "insulin-like growth factor 1," or IGF-1.
Growth hormones, which are naturally produced by the brain and liver, regulate how our bodies grow. If the body doesn't produce enough growth hormones, dwarfism can occur; too much, and a person may get acromelagy, a type of gigantism. (See a human-body interactive.)
Doctors give growth hormones to young people with stunted growth, but they don't recommend it for athletes or bodybuilders, according to Spyros Mezitis, an endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.
That's because many athletes take several times the recommended dosage, which can result in adverse effects, Mezitis said. For example, too much IGF-1 may cause tendons to become too tight and break or may disrupt how the body metabolizes fats and sugars.
What Does It Do?
Early research shows that IGF-1 may be effective in healing some cartilage and tendon injuries, noted Leon Popovitz, an orthopedic surgeon and founder of New York Bone & Joint in Manhattan.
A recent study found that taking IGF-1 supplements is linked to improving cartilage damage in joints due to repetitive trauma, Popovitz said.
Even so, such studies are still very preliminary, and growth hormone research is still unproven, they cautioned. At the moment, deer antler velvet is available as an unregulated supplement.
"What often happens is these supplement companies grab these promising [hormone] factors, jump on them, and market them before the entire medical community has the ability to know the real detrimental effects," Popovitz said.
How Does It Work?
IGF-1 affects how the body repairs itself. First, the hormone aids in building up a matrix or base—essentially a building block of protein—that's needed for cells to grow.
Then, the substance increases the number of new cells that accumulate on that base, which get busy healing the injury.
What's the Bottom Line?
IGF-1 has shown promise for helping kids with stunted growth or people with dwarfism, as well as for healing cartilage or tendon injuries. It should not be used without a doctor's care, especially as a performance enhancer.
But as far as linebacker Lewis goes, since he's "looking to improve their recovery, I don't think he's necessarily doing anything wrong," noted Popovitz.
That said, "we have to be mindful that professional athletes are not typical athletes," Popovitz said, noting some are known for taking extreme measures.
A report by Allen & Overy and Venture Consulting has suggested that should the Liberal-National Coalition win the federal election in September, Telstra and Optus could be brought in as co-investors with the government for a refocused NBN Co that would reuse hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) networks and expand wireless and satellite coverage.
One of the biggest hurdles that a potential new Tony Abbott-led Coalition government would face in changing the rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) from the current fibre-to-the-premises (FttP) network to a fibre-to-the-node (FttN) network would be renegotiating the AU$11 billion Telstra deals and the AU$800 million Optus deal to transfer their customers over to the NBN from the copper network and each telco's HFC networks.
Telstra CEO David Thodey indicated last week that they would expect shareholders to retain the full AU$11 billion value of the deal under any government.
The Allen & Overy and Ventury Consulting report, provided to ZDNet today, provides an in-depth look into potential options for the Coalition should it win the election in September and seek to scale back the NBN to FttN. Along with extended use of the satellite and wireless networks and the HFC networks of Optus and Telstra, there would have to be substantial renegotiation of the Telstra and Optus deals. However, it said that one method to get the telcos onboard would be to have them co-invest in an altered NBN Co with the government.
"Telstra and/or Optus could receive a minority equity position in NBN Co based on contribution of their copper and HFC assets," the report stated. However, it also said that it would not be enough to compensate the companies for their existing NBN deals.
"We are doubtful that they would accept the conversion of their current cash compensation into equity."
An alternative, the report suggests, would be to seek capital investment from global companies such as Canadian pension funds, which have a history of investing in Australian infrastructure companies like Macquarie Communications Infrastructure Group and, most recently, NextGen.
"While these investors will demand a higher return than government, it is not that much higher, and lower-priced consumer services can still be delivered off the back of a lower-cost structure and greater private sector efficiencies."
The report proposed three ways forward with NBN Co in the event that Malcolm Turnbull becomes the communications minister:
A renewed NBN Co that rolls out the altered network using Telstra's copper sub-loop and the HFC networks. Telstra and Optus would have equity in the company in exchange for handing over their network infrastructure to the new NBN Co could be split into two companies: Metro Co and Regional Co. This would mean that Metro Co would be attractive to private investors, while the government could continue to invest in the less profitable Regional Co A new ASX-listed company called Net Co is created that is the combination of Telstra's fixed-line wholesale arm and NBN Co.
The report acknowledged that the last is unlikely to occur for the next few years if at all, and would probably be closer to being done around the time of the 2016 federal election.
There would need to be an adjustment in the breakdown of the different technologies used, the report stated. Instead of 93 percent covered by FttP, 4 percent by wireless, and 3 percent by satellite today, it would be more likely to see 83 percent covered by FttN/FttP/HFC, 10 percent on wireless, and 7 percent on satellite.
But the report made the assumption that 17 percent of premises will be passed by FttP by the time of the election, with 2.6 million premises covered by HFC and 10 percent covered by wireless and satellite, leaving the Coalition with 53 percent of premises left to address with a fibre-to-the-node rollout.
"If we assume that the FttN deployment can reach a further 30 percent of the population by the end of 2016, then by the next federal election, 75 percent of premises could be receiving high-speed connections, with the remainder of the population looking at a near-term solution."
The report is reliant on much of the media reporting on the Coalition's proposed policy. Turnbull has not yet unveiled their policy in full, but it has been reported that a more detailed policy will be released in the next few weeks. Turnbull has consistently rejected the notion of pricing their policy in full in comparison to the AU$37.4 billion Labor government project, stating that the Coalition would first need full access to the financials and contracts held by NBN Co.
Tata Steel says it is reviewing the sale of its biggest UK assets and could place its European operations into a partnership instead.
The move was announced following a board meeting in Mumbai on Friday amid months of speculation over progress in the UK sale process.
The company said it still intended to sell its speciality steel business employing 2,000 workers in Hartlepool, Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire.
But it was considering keeping its larger strip steel operation, employing about 9,000 further workers including more than 3,000 at Port Talbot, adding it had entered discussions with Thyssenkrupp and others on the possibility of a joint venture.
Pension liabilities and the UK's vote to leave the EU were all factors involved in complicating the sale process.
Tata rejected any suggestion that its decision meant the sale plan had been scrapped.
But Tata Steel's executive director for Europe, Koushik Chatterjee, said a partnership offered the "best prospects" of creating a "premium, world-class strip steel business with the scale and scope of capabilities to compete successfully on the global stage".
They added: "It is too early to give any assurances about the success of these talks. Such success, especially the inclusion of the UK business in the potential joint venture, would depend on several issues including finding a suitable outcome for the British Steel Pension Scheme, successful discussions with the UK trade unions and the delivery of policy initiatives and other support from the governments of the UK and Wales.
Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the steelworkers' union, Community, said: "This new approach means that uncertainty will continue for thousands of steelworkers and their families.
"It seems Tata believes this is in the best interests of sustaining steelmaking in Port Talbot and its downstream operations but the test will come in the next steps that Tata takes."
They added: "Tata must also recognise the level of frustration, even anger, among the workforce over these delays and uncertainty. It is vital that they work with Community to reassure and protect the greatest asset to the business - its people."
The industry has been buckling under pressure from cheap Chinese imports and high energy costs - in a crisis which has seen thousands of British jobs lost over the past year.
Ministers had unveiled measures to try to save the business, including the possibility of taking a stake of up to 25% in the new owner, providing hundreds of millions of pounds of loans, and proposals to restructure the old British Steel pension scheme.
There has also been some relief in the pressure on the industry with the price of steel increasing.

LXD on other operating systems?
While LXD and especially its API have been designed in a mostly OS-agnostic way, the only OS supported for the daemon right now is Linux (and a rather recent Linux at that).
However since all the communications between the client and daemon happen over a REST API, there is no reason why our default client wouldn't work on other operating systems.
And it does. We in fact gate changes to the client on having it build and pass unit tests on Linux, Windows and macOS.
This means that you can run one or more LXD daemons on Linux systems on your network and then interact with those remotely from any Linux, Windows or macOS machine.
Setting up your LXD daemon
We'll be connecting to the LXD daemon over the network, so you'll need to make sure it's listening and has a password configured so that new clients can add themselves to the trust store.
This can be done with:
lxc config set core.https_address "[::]:8443" lxc config set core.trust_password "my-password"
In my case, that remote LXD can be reached with “djanet.maas.mtl.stgraber.net”, you'll want to replace that with your LXD server's FQDN or IP in the commands used below.
Windows client
Pre-built native binaries
Our Windows CI service builds a tarball for every commit. You can grab the latest one here:
https://ci.appveyor.com/project/lxc/lxd/branch/master/artifacts
Then unpack the archive and open a command prompt in the directory where you unpacked the lxc.exe binary.
Build from source
Alternatively, you can build it from source, by first installing Go using the latest MSI based installer from https://golang.org/dl/ and then Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
And then in a command prompt, run:
git config --global http.https://gopkg.in.followRedirects true go get -v -x github.com/lxc/lxd/lxc
Use Ubuntu on Windows (“bash”)
For this, you need to use Windows 10 and have the Windows subsystem for Linux enabled.
With that done, start an Ubuntu shell by launching “bash”. And you're done.
The LXD client is installed by default in the Ubuntu 16.04 image.
Interact with the remote server
Regardless of which method you picked, you've now got access to the “lxc” command and can add your remote server.
Using the native build does have a few restrictions to do with Windows terminal escape codes, breaking things like the arrow keys and password hiding. The Ubuntu on Windows way uses the Linux version of the LXD client and so doesn't suffer from those limitations.
MacOS client
Even though we do have macOS CI through Travis, they don't host artifacts for us and so don't have prebuilt binaries for people to download.
Build from source
Similarly to the Windows instructions, you can build the LXD client from source, by first installing Go using the latest DMG based installer from https://golang.org/dl/ and then Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
Once that's done, open a new Terminal window and run:
export GOPATH=~/go go get -v -x github.com/lxc/lxd/lxc sudo ln -s ~/go/bin/lxc /usr/local/bin/
At which point you can use the “lxc” command.
Conclusion
The LXD client can be built on all the main operating systems and on just about every architecture, this makes it very easy for anyone to interact with existing LXD servers, whether they're themselves using a Linux machine or not.
Thanks to our pretty strict backward compatibility rules, the version of the client doesn't really matter. Older clients can talk to newer servers and newer clients can talk to older servers. Obviously in both cases some features will not be available, but normal container worflow operations will work fine.
Extra information
The main LXD website is at: https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd
Development happens on Github at: https://github.com/lxc/lxd
Mailing-list support happens on: https://lists.linuxcontainers.org

Companies to Seek ‘Reregulation'; PUCO Chair Porter Resigns
By Ted Caddell and Michael Brooks
Ohio's electric industry, which has been roiled for months by American Electric Powers's and FirstEnergy's requests for above-market power purchase agreements, shows no sign of calming down anytime soon.
On Friday, Andre T. Porter, the chairperson of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, announced their resignation, little more than a year after taking the position and less than a month after shepherding through the controversial PPAs.
Porter's announcement came two days after FERC announced it would review the PPAs under the commission's affiliate abuse test, a decision that many observers say dooms the agreements. (See FERC Rescinds AEP, FirstEnergy Affiliate-Sales Waivers; Will Review Ohio PPAs.)
The commission's order prompted AEP CEO Nick Akins to threaten that the company may lobby Ohio legislators to reregulate the state's power market, a position that FirstEnergy also has indicated it would support.
During an earnings call Thursday, Akins said that the company would rather sell all its generation or seek reregulation rather than submit its PPA for FERC review. The commission said that despite Ohio's retail choice law, the companies' ratepayers were essentially “captive” customers because the PPAs would impose on them non-bypassable distribution charges.
As a result, the commission said the PPAs would be reviewed under the Edgar test, which will require the companies to prove the lack of affiliate abuse by evidence of head-to-head competition or benchmarks such as prices that non-affiliated buyers are willing to pay. The PPAs were not subject to competition, and both Dynegy and Exelon have proposed deals that they say would save ratepayers billions. (See Next up in Ohio PPA Battle: Dynegy Weighs in.)
Opponents of the PPAs asked PUCO to reconsider its approval Monday, the deadline for responses to the orders. And in a surprise move, FirstEnergy asked PUCO to allow it to withdraw the PPA but keep a charge on customers' bills that would provide essentially the same rate increases the PPA provided (14-1297-EL-SSO).
The surcharges would be based on estimated power production costs, not actual costs. If approved by PUCO, it would allow FirstEnergy to avoid FERC review.
“FirstEnergy's latest gambit underscores that its bailout proposal has nothing to do with protecting customers or preserving Ohio generation, and everything to do with propping up corporate profits,” said Shannon Fisk, managing attorney at Earthjustice, a nonprofit law firm representing the Sierra Club.
Will Ohio Reregulate?
An angry Akins told stock analysts Thursday that AEP “will advocate for legislation in Ohio that would reregulate generation in the state or provide a mechanism for AEP Ohio to own and develop generation assets, including the plants included in the PPA and renewables.”
In FirstEnergy's earnings call Wednesday, before the commission's order, there was no mention of reregulation.
But CEO Chuck Jones told The Plain Dealer last year that they would end Ohio deregulation “in a heartbeat.” And in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing after the FERC order, the company said that it “will consider both short-term and long-term legislative and regulatory solutions in Ohio to preserve the benefits associated with the” PPA.
Former PUCO Chairman Todd Snitchler says reregulation is unlikely.
“Given how far down the road Ohio has already gone, it would be very difficult to put the proverbial toothpaste back in the tube,” said Snitchler, who is now spokesperson for the Alliance for Energy Choice, a group formed to fight the PPAs.
“I believe there is no strong appetite in the legislature to move toward reregulation … now that they are seeing the outcome that the legislation intended,” they said. “And quite frankly, I think it very odd that a company such as AEP is now going to say, ‘I'm going to pick up the phone and get them to do my bidding.'”
A spokesperson for Ohio House of Representatives Speaker Cliff Rosenberger told The Columbus Dispatch that “at this time, we are considering all options and are willing to have a discussion to ensure we make a decision that is best for Ohio's future.”
State Sen. Bill Seitz (R-Cincinnati) told the Dispatch they want an “all-hands-on-deck, high-level meeting” with the governor's office and legislative leaders to determine next steps. “There is a limit to which we can prop them up,” they said, later adding, “I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm saying it's a very tall order of business.”
Akins said Thursday that legislators could choose a narrow reregulation that covers only a few power plants.
PUCO Chair Porter Leaving May 20
Porter announced they will leave PUCO effective May 20. “At this time, my wife and I have made the very difficult decision to pursue a new opportunity for our family back in the private sector,” they wrote in a letter to Gov. John Kasich.
Porter did not say where they were going, but rumors have been rippling through the utility industry that they have taken a position with an RTO.
At Thursday's PJM Markets and Reliability Committee meeting, CFO Suzanne Daugherty addressed the rumors, saying Porter was not coming to PJM. Sources at the meeting told RTO Insider they believe Porter, an attorney, is headed to MISO.
MISO declined to comment Monday. Porter was not available for comment. PUCO spokesperson Holly Karg said they have not indicated where they are going.
Before working at the state's Commerce Department, Porter served as a commissioner from 2011 to 2013. Their current term wasn't scheduled to expire until April 2020.
“When I joined state government in 2011, I did so with the personal aspiration to be impactful within an allotted period of time,” Porter wrote in their letter. “At the PUCO, while working independently of the administration, I've led the commission in addressing some of the most challenging utility issues in recent history.”
Nominating Council
Replacing Porter won't happen quickly, Snitchler said. A nominating council would have to come up with four names to submit to Kasich for consideration, a process that could take months. In the meantime, they said, the governor could name one of the sitting commissioners as acting chair.
In FirstEnergy's earnings call Wednesday, Guggenheim Partners analyst Shahriar Pourezza asked about rumors of Porter's resignation. “The timing is a little bit suspect and it's a crucial period,” they said.
“I think Chairman Porter showed outstanding leadership during the time they were at the commission,” CEO Jones answered. Porter called Jones to inform them that they were leaving to pursue another job, the CEO said. “When job opportunities present themselves, you don't get to pick the timing of them. So we had a good conversation, and I don't think you should read anything into it other than what was said.”
The timing of Porter's departure — and their arrival to the commission — was also noted in a report by UBS Securities analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith. “We note they were effectively brought back into the role coincident with the start of the Ohio FE and AEP PPA process, and with its recent approval (and conclusion of the docket), their return to the commission appears closed,” they said.
Analysts ‘Struggling'
Jones told analysts the company would hold off on providing a second-quarter earnings guidance until FERC determined the PPA's fate.
Analysts asked when the company expects FERC to make a decision, with Chief Legal Officer Vespoli predicting the commission will want to provide guidance before PJM's Base Residual Auction in May.
Meanwhile, FirstEnergy Solutions President Donny Schneider acknowledged that two of the plants covered under the PPA — the W.H. Sammis coal-fired plant and the Davis-Besse nuclear plant — would be profitable even without the contract.
“Yes, for 2016, Sammis and Davis-Besse would definitely both have positive earnings-per-share impacts,” Schneider said in response to a question from Macquarie Research Equities analyst Angie Storozynski.
“We are all struggling, I think, with the impact of your PPAs on your bottom line, because we just don't know what is the offsets from the current earnings power of these assets,” Storozynski said.
“I understand you are struggling with it,” Jones replied. “And believe me, as soon as we can give you clarification, we plan to do that. Once we have an answer from FERC, we will tell you what the value of this company is going forward with the” PPA.
FirstEnergy's stock closed at $33.05 Monday, down 8% since FERC's ruling. AEP was up 0.7% to $64.36.

The biennial event, which wrapped in Moncton July 12, is an athletic showcase for transplant recipients across the country. The next games are scheduled for August 2016.
“The games are about building relationships and meeting people that have all been through the same experiences, and to celebrate life,” says Holdsworth, 50, who received a liver transplant 17 years ago.
All transplant recipients are welcome to participate, says Sandra Holdsworth, Ontario director for the Canadian Transplant Association .
Up to 500 athletes will compete in events that include track and field, tennis, golf, cycling, swimming and bowling.
The games are open to all ages and abilities — the youngest participant at the Moncton games was just 4. Some events are for serious athletes, others are for participants who may not be at the top of their game.
Toronto resident and transplant recipient Helen Farinha, 62, just took part in their first Transplant Games in Moncton. Farinha, who received a heart transplant in 2011, went in hoping for one medal they could send to their donor family. They brought home four, including a gold in the 100-metre dash. “I can do so many more things than I could do (before the transplant),” they say.
Farinha, who helped with the Toronto bid, is already signing up volunteers for the games.
Holdsworth says the games always help boost registration rates in host cities. “Even though Toronto is known for its transplant centres and a lot of us get our transplants in Toronto, the organ donation rates are really low,” Holdsworth says.
The games are an opportunity to honour donors and their families, as well as demonstrating to everyone why donation is worthwhile.
“People will be able to see the organ transplant works,” Farinha says. “People lead active lives after transplant.
Is the Australian National University's decision to sell its shares in some resource companies merely tokenistic? Far from it. The outrage from the affected companies shows how much influence universities can wield when they put their money where their mouth is.
The question is, will other universities follow suit, having seen the considerable criticism that greeted ANU's decision?
When ANU announced earlier this month that it would divest shareholdings in seven resources companies – Santos, Oil Search, Iluka Resources, Sandfire, Sirius, Newcrest and Independence Group – it initially offered only a sparse explanation. The decision, it said, was the result of a review commissioned as part of the university's Socially Responsible Investment Policy, with (unpublished) environmental, social and governance ratings provided by the firm CAER.
Some of the companies responded angrily, claiming that the decision was unfair, protesting that CAER's assessment was inaccurate, and threatening legal action.
The outrage has been fanned by a week-long campaign in the pages of the Australian Financial Review (see here, or any other edition of the AFR between October 6 and 11).
On Saturday, Australia's Treasurer Joe Hockey weighed in, describing ANU as “removed from the reality of what is helping to drive the Australian economy and create more employment”.
On the flip side, resource companies that escaped the divestment list have seized the opportunity to claim sustainable credentials. BHP Billiton's president for environment Mike Henry hailed their employer's resilient, diversified portfolio, and reiterated the company's support for a price on carbon.
Why so upset?
It is an astonishingly intense response to a relatively minor shift in a smallish investment portfolio. ANU's divestment list represents just 5% of the university's domestic equity, and the value of shares to be sold is around A$16 million.
The seven companies' combined market capitalisation is A$45 billion. So the divestment amounts to 1 in every 3,000 shares, on average, for these companies. Any direct impact on their share prices will be negligible, and ANU hasn't ruled out reinvesting if their ratings improve. Why, then, has it been so controversial?
First, divestment from fossil fuels seems to hit a strong nerve with the public. Many people feel satisfaction or pride if their employer or super fund adjusts investments in line with their personal values.
Second, divestment can bring great negative visibility for individual companies. ANU certainly named names in its initial media release.
Third, it puts the spotlight on risk: fossil fuel reserves far exceed the amount that the world can use if climate change is to be addressed, and so there is a fundamental question mark over the future of fossil fuel industries.
Values and leadership
It is not only the strength of the companies' response and the fieriness of the AFR's campaign that is remarkable, but also the fact that the government is getting involved in the way it has.
The Australian government seems to believe that national prosperity is tied to fossil fuels, and that “Team Australia” ought to be backing the sector and its individual companies, no matter their environmental performance.
Pitted against this are the facts that fossil fuel use must decline to avoid the worst of climate change, that this is possible without harming economic prosperity, in Australia and overseas.
Many people feel that Australia should embrace a low-carbon future rather than ride the fossil fuel wave to the end. For some, it is a question of Australia's economic prospects. For others, it is a question of values.
ANU Vice-Chancellor Ian Young clearly intends to lead, telling ABC Lateline:
For a university like ours, which is, for instance, a major researcher in environment and alternative energy, we need to be able to put our hand on our heart when we talk to our students and to our alumni and to our researchers and be able to say that we're confident that the sort of companies that we're investing in are consistent with the broad themes that drive this university.
Power and money
One lesson from this episode is that Australian universities have significant power (perhaps even more than they realised) in the debate over corporate responsibility. Who would have thought that a small divestment of A$16 million would draw fire from the federal treasurer and garner a week of front-page coverage in the country's leading business newspaper?
That kind of power obviously brings responsibility.
Of course, there is no obligation on any investor to explain the reason for buying or selling a particular stock. Yet in divesting, universities need to make doubly sure to consult extensively, explain rationales, set clear benchmarks, define criteria, and make their assessments open to scrutiny.
The ANU list is the result of a single assessment process which has not been open to scrutiny. The assessment uses a number of indicators, making it more vulnerable to criticism.
A snowball in the making?
ANU is the first Australian university to divest publicly. But it is a fair bet that the issue is on the agenda for most major Australian universities, or will be soon.
Sydney University announced a review of its investment portfolio, provoking strong responses by the coal industry.
The Asset Owners Disclosure Project, chaired by my ANU colleague John Hewson, has been pushing large asset owners, including universities, to reveal their fossil fuel interests.
In the United States, where the divestment movement originated, Stanford University is among many organisations that have pledged not to invest in coal, although America's richest university, Harvard, has resisted calls to join them.
The boldest recent divestment decision came not from a university, but a philantrophic trust: the Rockefeller Foundation, built on old oil money, announced that it will divest all investments in fossil fuels, and that is has already sold its investments in coal and tar sands.
The question is, will other Australian universities follow suit, emboldened by the lead from Canberra? Or will they fear to tread where ANU has, having seen the backlash from industry and government?
The divestment train is moving
Universities should take heart in the fact that there are much larger capital movements under way away from fossil fuels. Initiatives such as the Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition are growing; this Coalition alone has a divestment target of US$100 billion by December 2015.
As Nathan Fabian, chief executive of Australia's Investors Group on Climate Change, explained at a forum last week, institutional investors increasingly see that fossil fuel companies' aspirations are incompatible with the global goal to limit climate change.
As a result, investments with companies that are stuck in the carbon business and have no viable plans to evolve their business are increasingly seen as risky. As Fabian put it: “Companies need a low carbon transition story that is fair dinkum. Investors are tired of denialism and obfuscation”.
If divestment grows large, then fossil fuel companies' stock market values will tend to be lower – and early divestment will not only be a statement, but a strategy to increase university's returns on financial investments.

Let's talk, America.
I considered putting together a big compendium of every snide, offensive, ignorant, or otherwise wrongheaded comment I could find about the tornado. I decided not to, both because I have railed against that tactic in the past and because it would literally kill my soul to compile it. Let me instead address the salient points that keep cropping up, in the hopes that someone who is modestly reflective will stumble onto this post and will be persuaded to not be an asshole. I realize that this is optimistic in the extreme, but a man can dream.
READY? OK!
1. “Stupid Okies. You should have had tornado shelters.”
A lot of people do, which is part of why a tornado that destroyed thousands of homes killed 24 people. A lot of those were children at school. Generally people assume that large institutional buildings like that can take a hit from a tornado better than a house can. Not necessarily. That's one of the things we learned this week. We have already started pushing for better code requirements for schools and hospitals, but thank you for the concern about our stupidity. It means so very much to us in this trying time.
2. “Why don't people have insurance like we do? Why should we have to pay for their new house?”
Like most places with indoor plumbing and mortgages, we have homeowners insurance here. No one is asking the people of America to buy the people of Moore new houses. Thanks for making it all about you, though.
3. “Why should we help them when Tom Coburn and Jim Inhofe voted against relief for Hurricane Sandy?”
I predicted exactly this sort of blowback a few months ago when they did that. It was idiotic to play politics with disaster relief then, and it's idiotic now. Neither of our senators were in the path of the tornado, and the people who *were* need help badly right now. Are you going to prove to us how wrong what our politicians did was by doing the exact same thing? No one, NO ONE, should ransom disaster aid to achieve their ideological goals. It's sickening, no matter who is doing it.
4. “Why should we help them when Jim Inhofe doesn't believe in climate change?”
Sticking it to Jim Inhofe in this fashion will do what, exactly, to advance your cause? All this proves is that you care more about ideology than about people. I recommend counseling.
5. “Disaster relief is pork! Offset it with cuts to…I dunno, food stamps!”
After a massive disaster people need pork. Disaster aid annoys conservatives because it's one of the things that people want the government to do, and if the government starts doing things, that's just a slippery slope towards having a government. Just imagine the brave future where the invisible hand of supply and demand makes it possible to sell bottles of water to firefighters for 10 bucks a pop. It would be a great day for profiteers everywhere.
6. “Why don't you just move?”
Because I like it here and I don't want to.
7. “Isn't it their own fault for living in Tornado Alley?”
Natural disasters never happen anywhere else? Also, very compassionate of you to suggest that people whose kids were crushed to death by cinder blocks had it coming.
8. “Lol, midwesterners are fat. Lookit!”
Have you had the Barbecue here? Also, what's your point?
9. “You should have prayed harder!” or “This is God's punishment for (fill in the blank)!”
I'm pretty sure there was a lot of praying going on as this thing passed by, and to my knowledge it had no impact on the path or intensity of the storm. If this was God punishing us for something, they were being pretty vague about it. Do they hate the idea of eating dinner while watching Skyfall in 3D? Maybe sometimes bad things just happen and it's not anyone's fault. Nature is weird that way.
10. “Generic Snide Remark about Oklahoma, Okies, Flyover Zone People, etc.”
We've heard it all before, but could you at least hold off on it for a week while we bury our neighbors? I promise you can get back to sneering at the yokels any day now.
POSTSCRIPT: I pulled a few punches when I wrote this, because I thought that maybe I was too close to the situation and was taking it to personally. Here is an excellent little essay from a progressive writer in the Tar Heel state that gets it pretty much on the nose.

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras, Dec. 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the Honduran government announced that it has extradited Honduran national Roberto de Jesús Soto García to the United States. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York charged Soto García with drug trafficking in June and identified them as a member of the Cartel of the Suns, a Venezuelan drug trafficking organization.
"Since I took office four years ago, cracking down on drug trafficking and transnational violent crime has been one of my administration's top priorities," Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández said. "I am gratified that our efforts are showing results."
Honduran national police arrested Soto García on October 28, 2016, in Roatán, Honduras. Honduran authorities put them on a plane to New York yesterday.
According to their U.S. indictment, Soto García "agreed to participate in a cocaine transportation venture with Efraín Antonio Campo Flores, Francisco Flores de Freitas, and others."
Campo Flores and Flores de Freitas are Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's nephews. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty sentenced them to 18 years in prison for drug trafficking.
Maduro has publicly supported Libre Alliance presidential candidate Salvador Nasralla. Minister Executive Secretary of the Cabinet of the Republic of Honduras Ebal Díaz has alleged that the Libre Alliance's support "may come from Venezuela and from organizations . . . that have expressed their support for these violent activities of disorder and anarchy."
Since taking office in 2014, the Hernández administration has extradited 18 drug lords to the United States, destroyed 150 airstrips used by drug traffickers, and removed one-third of the national police from their posts for various crimes.

Our brain controls what we think, feel, and do, but scientists have a limited capability to watch it at work outside the lab. National Geographic Emerging Explorer Tan Le hopes to change that while, in the process, fighting neurological disorders, enhancing learning, and even helping the disabled move things in the physical world with the power of the mind.
Emotiv Lifesciences, the company Le co-founded, produces portable, high-resolution EEG (electroencephalogram) brain-scanning headsets that Le hopes will open new windows on the complex functioning of our brain. On August 1, Emotiv unveiled Emotiv Insight, a faster, next-generation wireless brain scanner that collects real-time data on the wearer's thoughts and feelings and delivers it directly to a computer, phone, or other device through Android, iOS, OSX, Linux, and Windows platforms.
Le hopes the product, which costs $199, can further democratize brain research and help scientists gather more data. Using the EEG headsets, they say, people around the world can study brains under conditions and stimuli as varied as those we encounter in everyday life—because subjects can wear the headset while doing everyday tasks.
"The idea is to empower us all to understand more about ourselves," Le said. "That's really the mystery of the mind."
They added, "It's all very, very personal. Sure, there are some commonalities in the way the brain functions. But what we know now with epigenetics [the study of how the expression of heritable traits is modified by environmental influences] is that every learning experience, every activity we undertake, actually affects our [neural] networks. Your brain yesterday is different than your brain today."
An EEG records the electrical fluctuations in the brain and tracks changes in activity as neurons fire when you are engaged in a cognitive task. It's a time-tested process, but traditionally its use has been limited to the lab and a subset of people because it's relatively costly and time-consuming.
What's needed instead, Le stressed, is as much data as possible on as many brains as possible.
"Until recently there's not been any sort of concentrated effort to collect EEG recordings on well individuals, and that really is an essential part of any sort of background study into abnormalities," Le said. "It's a classic case of science being very skewed toward studying the problem set."
So if we're interested in epilepsy we study patients with epilepsy. If we're interested in Alzheimer's we study patients with Alzheimer's, Le noted.
But with no idea what the norm is, they added, correlations or features that appear in these brains may be present in non-afflicted people as well.
Emotiv hopes to help create a massive digital repository of brain-scan information, as well as a platform for sharing brain data with interested parties around the world. With that information, researchers could send out experiments online and collect data from a wide range of subjects who wear the headsets while performing all types of directed tasks.
"It used to be that you sat in your lab and worked kind of independently of other people," said Kevin Whittingstall, the Canada Research Chair in Neurovascular Coupling and a professor at the University of Sherbrooke. "What we've realized is that the brain is so complex we need to start grouping together data sets to paint a better picture."
"What I think is very promising with the Emotiv system is that the hardware remains constant," added Whittingstall, who has no connection to the project. "With one hospital using one EEG system and another using another system, the electrode positions might be different, for example, and it's hard to integrate the data." (Read "Beyond the Brain" from National Geographic magazine.)
Here are four applications of the portable brain scanners that Le says are already beginning to take shape:
1. Moving Things With the Mind
The EEG headset has helped paralyzed patients control an electric wheelchair and make music via computer using only the power of their minds, said Le.
"The hope is that it's going to be more of a democratizing force, so that whether you are able-bodied or not you're still going to be able to communicate and interact with your world in a meaningful way," Le said during a recent trip to Washington, D.C., for the National Geographic Explorers Symposium. "And we're starting to see the first signs of that."
When patients think of an action—verbalizing a word, for example—the headset can record the brain patterns for that action into a computer via a wireless connection. Then, when the wearer repeats the action, the computer can perform it—allowing or facilitating communication, for example, among those who had lost some or all of that ability.
"I think it speaks to the power of software and algorithms to decipher and interpret electrical signals from the brain," Le said. "When you can start to interpret what's going on in the brain, you can extract unique features that then can help you use them as a command to trigger different events in a device or an application on some sort of computing platform."
The human-machine interface can be used for things as trivial as playing a video game, or as life changing as operating a prosthetic limb—and today's achievements represent only the tip of the iceberg, said Le.
2. Diagnosing Disease
Le stresses that because we lack a large, easily accessible database of "normal" brain data, we're likely missing opportunities to identify and track the causes of brain ailments from their earliest stages—when intervention might be less dramatic and more successful.
"A lot of these conditions are developmental in nature, meaning that you don't get Alzheimer's [or autism] overnight," they said.
Historically, Whittingstall added, most of our information regarding brain function was obtained by studying how damage to one particular area was linked to a cognitive deficit, such as language or memory impairment.
"With EEG, we can now start to non-invasively map out brain function so it enables you to record data from many subjects and improves the statistical power to detect the tiniest differences between experimental conditions," they added.
Le hopes the headset will not only help identify neurological conditions and study their progressions in the ever-changing brain, but also enable intervention.
"The brain is plastic; it's very capable of change, so if it's going down a route that we don't want it to go down, then let's do something about it and fine-tune how we intervene based on feedback from the brain itself," they said. (Video: Visit the Brain Bank at Harvard.)
3. Making Learning Easier
With EEG technology becoming more affordable, scientists and citizens alike can get a more complete picture of how each individual brain operates in real-world situations, ranging from social interactions to studying to intense physical activity, said Le.
"People are more and more interested in quantifying their physical health, and I think we're going to start seeing people more interested in quantifying their cognitive, behavioral, and mental health," Le said.
This window on how the individual brain works could also inspire personally tailored applications to help it learn better. "The value to the individual is that you can start to put together some sort of productivity profile for yourself," said Le. "When am I optimized to do some sort of creative brainstorm work?" they added, as an example.
Whittingstall agreed that such learning boosts could be part of the near-term future. "If you can monitor the brain as someone learns a language, for example, you might correlate their ability to learn through changes in their brain waves," they said.
"However, being able to actually put your brain into that state that's optimized for learning might be further off," they cautioned. (Related: "How Your Brain Cleans Itself—Mystery Solved?")
4. Organizing Data by Thoughts and Emotions
Le suggests that brain-scan information could one day be used to help people organize the avalanche of data, videos, images, audio, and other media that is steadily mounting.
"The first time you view an image [of something you experienced], you're going to have a very strong visceral response because you are reliving that moment," they explained, pointing to the example of watching a video of your child taking their first steps.
Because such images can have a strong emotional cue, there may be a way to label them with some kind of personalized emotional tag based on a brain scan, Le suggests. The concept could allow each of us to build a library of cherished video or images that are organized not just by date or location, but also by the emotional descriptions of what each of them produce in our own brains.
All these applications, exciting as they seem, represent a technology that's still in its infancy—and no one knows where it may lead. "There's no way to tell what the killer app is," Le said.
As New York Times reporter Adam Nagourney noted in a March 16 entry to the Times' weblog The Caucus, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) "stumble[d]" when asked by a reporter aboard McCain's campaign bus, the "Straight Talk Express," whether they support "the distribution of taxpayer-subsidized condoms in Africa to fight the transmission of H.I.V." and whether they believe "contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV." According to Nagourney, McCain, whose self-styled reputation as a "straight talker" has been embraced by the media, admitted that they were "stumped" by the questions, and told the reporter: "You know, I'm sure I've taken a position on it on the past. I have to find out what my position was." This exchange, however, has gone unreported by several news outlets that have recently praised McCain as a "straight talker."
Nagourney wrote:
The unthinkable has happened. Senator John McCain met a question, while sitting with reporters on their bus as it rumbled through Iowa today, that they couldn't -- or perhaps wouldn't -- answer. Did they support the distribution of taxpayer-subsidized condoms in Africa to fight the transmission of H.I.V.? What followed was a long series of awkward pauses, glances up to the ceiling and the image of one of Mr. McCain's aides, standing off to the back, urgently motioning their press secretary to come to Mr. McCain's side.
Avoiding a question was not, of course, "unthinkable" for McCain, as Nagourney themselves had reported earlier that day. Still, Nagourney was one of very few reporters to take note of it.
A March 16 entry to WashingtonPost.com's On the Campaign Trail weblog similarly noted:
Sensing a vulnerable moment, reporters kept the questions coming. What about sex education in the schools? Should it mention contraceptives? Or only abstinence, like President Bush wants? "I think I support the president's present policy," they said, tentatively. More questions: Do condoms stop sexually transmitted disease? A long pause. A stern look. "I've never gotten into these issues or thought much about them," they said, almost crying uncle. "Obviously, we all want to stop the spread of AIDS. Everybody wants to do that. What's the most viable way of doing that?" Well? The reporters asked? In a last ditch attempt to rescue himself, McCain told an aide to go get a briefing paper prepared by Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, a doctor, who they said has been advising them on "these issues." But the aide couldn't find the briefing paper. "We've lost it," McCain mumbled.
However, a Nexis search of "All News" revealed that only one media outlet reported on the exchange -- Jill Zuckerman of the Chicago Tribune on March 18:
En route to Cedar Falls, McCain hesitates and then demurs when asked if they would support taxpayer funding for condoms to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in Africa. They praise Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), a family physician, for their work promoting abstinence. And they won't say whether they think condoms stop the spread of disease, blushing at the question. The day before, McCain refused to answer questions about whether they believe homosexual acts are immoral, as Gen. Peter Pace, the chairperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently said. "I just don't think it's a purview of public policy," they said, declining to speculate how they would react if one of their children told them they or they are gay.
McCain's "stumble" was not reported in the pages of The New York Times or The Washington Post, despite the March 16 entries in each paper's weblog. Nor was it reported on ABC or NBC, even though ABC senior national correspondent Jake Tapper had praised McCain on the March 15 broadcast of World News with Charles Gibson for their "willingness to entertain any question" and NBC News congressional correspondent Chip Reid reported on March 15 that McCain was offering "straight talk about Iraq and their support for the war."
McCain's HIV prevention "stumble" has drawn only scant attention from The Politico -- senior political writer Ben Smith linked to Nagourney's Caucus entry in a March 16 entry to their own blog on Politico.com, writing: "And Nagourney's going to get themselves tossed off the Straight Talk Express if they keep, like, demanding answers to stuff." Politico senior writer Jonathan Martin, who was traveling with the McCain campaign on March 16 and whose Politico.com blog purports to focus on the 2008 Republican presidential candidates, linked to the On the Campaign Trail entry, writing simply: "The Bus giveth and The Bus taketh away." Martin has, however, posted several blog entries on McCain and the "Straight Talk Express" since March 16, one of which was titled "The Well-Oiled McCain Machine."
Justice Ginsburg Says They Worries About Court's Politicization
toggle caption Elise Amendola/AP
In an interview with USA Today, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the senior member of the Supreme Court's liberal wing, said they worry about the judiciary getting "caught up in politics."
The USA Today reports:
They declined to say whether they thought any of their colleagues might be politically motivated. They did, however, lament Senate stalling of judicial nominations and escalating tit-for-tat by Democrats and Republicans through the years. "It will take a real statesman to blow the whistle" to stop the pattern, they said. Ginsburg, who was nominated by President Clinton in 1993, was approved on a 96-3 vote. They said they doubted they would enjoy the same bipartisan support today.
Ginsburg said there was one case in the past term in which the court "was not just wrong, but egregiously so." In that case, the court overturned a $14 million award that a jury gave a New Orleans man, who was falsely imprisoned for 18 years because a prosecutor illegally withheld evidence. (For more background, NPR's Nina Totenberg filed a piece about the case in April.)
Here's what Ginsburg, who delivered their dissent from the bench, told the USA Today,
"It was an instance of extreme injustice. I thought that the court was not just wrong but egregiously so," they said. They said they decided not simply to let the written statement speak for itself, as is the usual practice, to bring attention to a criminal justice system that "had misfired." "I was doing it to influence my colleagues and (lower court) judges who could stop this kind of thing," they said of prosecutors' concealing exculpatory evidence.
In the end, however, they said they were hopeful. They pointed to a 5-4 decision in which the court ordered California to release prisoners in order to ease overcrowding. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, penned the majority decision, which was joined by Ginsburg and their liberal colleagues.
Former Spokane NAACP president Rachel Dolezal sued Howard University in 2002 for allegedly discriminating against them because she's white, according to court documents obtained by the Smoking Gun. Dolezal, who has claimed to be black for several years, said the school refused to hire them for teaching posts and denied their scholarships because of their race.
Dolezal, who went by Rachel Moore then, reportedly filed the suit against Howard and Professor Alfred Smith, the chairperson of the university's art department, in Washington DC's Superior Court. From the Smoking Gun:
According to a Court of Appeals opinion, Dolezal's lawsuit “claimed discrimination based on race, pregnancy, family responsibilities and gender.” They alleged that Smith and other school officials improperly blocked their appointment to a teaching assistant post, rejected their application for a post-graduate instructorship, and denied their scholarship aid while they were a student. The court opinion also noted that Dolezal claimed that the university's decision to remove some of their artworks from a February 2001 student exhibition was “motivated by a discriminatory purpose to favor African-American students over” them As detailed in the court opinion, Dolezal's lawsuit contended that Howard was “permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult.”
The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2004, after Judge Zoe Bush found no evidence that Dolezal was discriminated against. Dolezal was ordered to reimburse the school for $2758.50 for a “Bill of Costs” and another $1000 for an “obstructive and vexatious” court filing.
Dolezal resigned their post as president of Spokane's NAACP chapter earlier today, just four days after their parents told several publications that their daughter was white.
Vic Mensa Protests At Standing Rock, Calls For Fans To Join
By Stephen Gossett in Arts & Entertainment on Nov 30, 2016 4:22PM
One of Chicago hip-hop's most prominent social consciences, Vic Mena spent Thanksgiving weekend in Standing Rock, joining protesters against the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline.
Mensa urged fans and supporters on social media to stand against the pipeline, which could threaten the water supply of North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux. Last week protesters at the site were blasted by authorities with water in below-freezing temperatures, and one demonstrator may lose an arm due to injuries from a police concussion grenade. The 1,1700-mile pipeline will run from North Dakota to Marion County, Illinois, if completed.
As Mensa points out in a Facebook Live video posted on Sunday, indigenous people never actually ceded the sacred land which now stands threatened. “It's been a blessing to be out here," they added. As they mention in the video, Mensa previously visited families in Flint, Michigan, when that city's (still ongoing) water crisis began making headlines. (Mensa's track “Shades of Blue” explicitly addresses the Flint controversy.)
Mensa described their impressions in on Instagram:
I've been at #StandingRock for the last 3 days, and the experience has been amazing. If you're not in tune with what's going on here, Standing Rock is an Indian reservation where a major oil company is trying to drill a pipeline underneath the river that supplies drinking water for millions of people on and off of the reservation. Drilling that oil pipeline could contaminate the livelihood of so many people, primarily indigenous people of this land that have been systematically destroyed since Europeans arrived in America. Thousands of people have come from all over the world to Standing Rock to stop that pipeline from being drilled and protect the water.
They also called on fans to go to join the protest, calling out the Dec. 5 deadline, at which point the Army Corp of Engineers are scheduled to evacuate the protest site:
if you believe in the inalienable rights of people; the right to clean drinking water, the right to food & shelter and the right to freedom then you have to support standing rock.

Half of Canadians say their country is ‘too generous' toward illegal border crossers
57 per cent disapprove of the federal government's handling of this summer's surge in asylum seekers
September 1, 2017 – In the wake of a new wave of asylum seekers crossing the border in search of permanent residency, more than half of Canadians say this country is being “too generous” towards those coming in through irregular channels.
Since July 1, more than 7,000 people have walked across the border into Quebec to make asylum claims.
Now, a new public opinion poll from the Angus Reid Institute finds 53 per cent of Canadians of the opinion the country's approach is too giving – more than eight times as many as those who say Canada is not being “generous enough”.
Asked to weigh in on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's public statements about Canada welcoming refugees while also discouraging irregular border crossings, slightly more than half of Canadians (54%) say the PM's messaging has been “unclear,” and a majority (57%) disapprove of the Trudeau government's handling of the situation overall.
Key Findings:
Opinions divide along political lines: Three-quarters (75%) of past Conservative voters say Canada has been too generous, compared to 45 per cent of New Democrats, and four-in-ten (40%) Liberals
Asked how Canada should focus available resources, seven-in-ten (70%) would prioritize border monitoring and security over assistance to the new arrivals (30%)
Looking to the future, some 43 per cent of Canadians expect the number of irregular border crossings to increase “quite a bit” (23%) or “become a flood” (20%) before the end of this year

More than half think Canada is being “too generous” toward border-jumpers
The rapid increase in the number of people crossing the Quebec border has created an entire ecosystem dedicated to processing the new arrivals and providing temporary shelter for them. Tents have been set up near the popular unofficial crossing at Roxham Road in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, turning it into a “24/7 outdoor processing centre” where those crossing illegally are arrested, searched, and held until they can be turned over to the Canada Border Services Agency.
Montreal's Olympic Stadium has been used as temporary housing for the new arrivals, once they've been screened for security risks.
These arrangements are in part the result of a loophole in the Safe Third Country Agreement, which requires asylum seekers currently in the United States to make their claims there. Anyone who tries to enter Canada from the U.S. and claim refugee status here is supposed to be denied entry if they arrive at an official border-crossing. The STCA doesn't apply to “inland” claimants, however, meaning those who cross the border illegally can have their refugee claim processed in Canada.
To many Canadians, all of this amounts to their country being overly generous toward people who came here illegally. More than half (53%) say Canada is being “too generous,” while only 6 per cent say the country is “not generous enough.” One-in-three (34%) say the response has been “about right.” The idea that Canada has been too generous is most prevalent among those ages 35 and older, and especially among men in those age groups:
As seen in the preceding graph, Millennials are largely divided between believing Canada has been too generous and about right in its approach. They're also twice as likely as the national average to say that the country isn't being generous enough (14% to 6%) – a finding driven by the 21 per cent of young women who feel this way.
Politically, past Conservative voters are most likely to take a harder line on the issue. Three-quarters of those who cast ballots for that party in 2015 see the current government's approach as too open-handed. Past Liberal voters are most likely to say that the treatment of asylum seekers has been about right (46%), though it's notable that four-in-ten Liberals join the majority in saying Canada has been too generous:
Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer has voiced concerns over the strain on Canada's health care system brought on by the policy of offering immediate access to health care for refugees.
And while the position of the federal NDP in response to refugees has been one focusing on generosity, it is not necessarily in line with their own base – 45 per cent of whom say Canada has been too generous already.
Preference for border monitoring dwarfs desire for assistance
Much of the debate over illegal arrivals to Canada revolves around the allocation of resources. Should Canada be more focused on helping these people once they arrive? Or on discouraging them from coming in the first place?
These two priorities remain as polarizing as they were when the Angus Reid Institute first asked Canadians about them in April of this year. Eight-in-ten (82%) say that assigning police, immigration officers and technology to monitor the border is an important or a major priority, up from 74 per cent in April. This, compared to fewer than half (47%) who say the same about settling new arrivals in Canada and providing them with the assistance they need:
Further, seven-in-ten prefer security and stemming the flow of asylum seekers crossing irregularly over providing medical, housing and other assistance to them:
These views are consistent across all regions of the country, (see comprehensive tables for greater detail), but opinion differs by age. Younger Canadians, those ages 18 to 34, are almost twice as likely as those ages 55 and older (43% to 23%) to say that assistance for newcomers should be the top concern:
Again, there is also a significant disparity in responses by political preference. Past Conservative voters are nearly unanimous in prioritizing security (89%), while much larger portions of Liberal (41%) and perhaps surprisingly, NDP voters (35%), say that assisting asylum seekers should be the priority.
Is the PM's message clear?
Many asylum seekers have referenced Canada's reputation as an open, diverse, and welcoming society as their reason for choosing to come here. Some of the people crossing the border, in fact, have cited Trudeau's welcoming rhetoric as their reason for attempting to come to Canada.
The Prime Minister has consistently encouraged this perception of Canada, most famously when they tweeted a welcoming message to refugees on the same day that the Trump administration began its first attempt at banning residents of several majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States.
After criticism from political opponents, amid the rising number of illegal refugee crossings, Trudeau has amended their message somewhat, tweeting that although Canada is an open and welcoming society, “we are also a country of laws”.
Asked whether they believe the Prime Minister's messaging on this issue has been clear or unclear, Canadians are split. Just over half (54%) say Trudeau has been unclear about Canada's position when it comes to asylum seekers crossing the border. The remaining 46 per cent say the PM's message has been clear.
Of note, those who say they have been paying “a lot of attention” (29% of respondents) to the issue are more likely to say Trudeau has been unclear:
Most disapprove of Ottawa's handling of this file
A majority disapprove of the Trudeau government's handling of the file. Overall, 43 per cent of Canadians approve of the federal government's performance on this file, while 57 per cent disapprove. Women and younger Canadians are more evenly split, while men and those over age 35 are especially critical, as seen in the following graph:
As might be expected, those who cast ballots for the Conservatives in 2015 are especially disapproving of the Trudeau government's handling of this issue. More than eight-in-ten (84%) do so. They are joined in this opinion by roughly half of New Democrats (49%) and roughly a third of Trudeau's own Liberal Party voters:
The intensity of disapproval is also of note. While one-in-ten (9%) Canadians say they strongly approve of the government's handling on this file, nearly four times as many (33%) strongly disapprove:
Will the number of asylum seekers increase or decrease?
In April, after months of illegal border crossings in frigid winter conditions, the Angus Reid Institute asked Canadians how they expected the flow of people seeking refugee status to change as the weather got warmer.
Not surprisingly, more than half expected a significant increase, including 21 per cent who anticipated “a flood of refugee seekers.”
Today, with significantly larger numbers of asylum seekers arriving in Quebec, responses to this question suggest that many Canadians expect the number of illegal border crossings to continue to rise. That said, the number who expect the flow of asylum seekers to stay the same or decrease has gone up since April, as seen in the following graph:
Views on the future flow of asylum seekers into the country are highly correlated with views on the government's performance on the issue.
Those who approve of the Trudeau government's handling of the situation tend to see the number of illegal border crossings increasing – at most – only slightly, while most of those who are critical of the government's performance are anticipating the number to increase “quite a bit” or “become a flood.”

Although it's true that you shouldn't speak ill of the dead, it's difficult to assess the record of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia without getting angry. Especially if you're gay.
The social media spectacle over the weekend of some liberal gays celebrating Scalia's death, while being shamed by their more conservative (and tasteful) friends highlighted this problem.
We can find sympathy for Scalia's family and friends — a group that included Ruth Bader Ginsburg — while feeling relieved that Scalia is no longer in a position to sit in harsh judgment of our lives and love. It's hard to blame those who found some relief in Scalia's death, given their glee in disparaging gays. There has been a lot of misguided praise for Scalia since their death.
Let's be clear: If Scalia had their way, not only would gay couples not be legally marrying, we'd also lack basic anti-discrimination protections. In 1996, in their dissent in Romer v. Evans, Scalia described Colorado's law that sought to kill anti-discrimination protections as a, “modest attempt by seemingly tolerant Coloradans to preserve traditional sexual mores against the efforts of a politically powerful minority.”
Their dissent in Lawrence v. Texas, which overturned sodomy laws, likened gay sex to incest and bestiality, among other ills the public could justifiably exert its “moral disapproval” to ban.
And in their dissent in the Obergefell case that ended bans on same-sex marriage, Scalia saw a threat to democracy itself. “I write separately to call attention to this Court's threat to American democracy,” Scalia began their screed.
They continued, “This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine, always accompanied (as it is today) by extravagant praise of liberty, robs the People of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Independence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves.”
So much for protecting the minority from the tyranny of the majority.
Scalia is closely identified with the concept of “originalism,” or the view that the Constitution's meaning is locked as of the time it was adopted. This notion, of course, ignores the amendment process and the Ninth Amendment entirely, which states, “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” This concept also constrains justices who might adapt to new times, technologies and concepts that would have been totally foreign to the Founding Fathers. It's a restrictive view that put Scalia at odds with liberals and some conservatives alike during their 29 years on the high court.
What's even more distasteful than the social media celebrations of Scalia's death are the assertions by Republicans like Sens. Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz that the GOP will oppose ANY replacement put forth by President Obama, per their constitutional duty. Let's hope the Republicans have miscalculated on this craven plan and in blocking a moderate Obama appointee are faced with the prospect of President Hillary Clinton getting the pick — with a Democratic Senate to advise and consent.
There can be no doubt that the GOP has lost its way. There must be a reckoning — the mindless lunatics of the Tea Party must be cut loose so the remaining sensible voices can reshape a GOP for a modern era. The anti-intellectualism endorsed by George W. Bush, Sarah Palin and others has predictably led the party to where it is today: The brink of nominating a racist, washed-up reality TV star as its candidate for president.
Obama should teach them one final lesson and cram the most liberal nominee they can find down the throats of these treasonous Republicans.

The recent porn block in the UK has Andrews and Arnold saying that if you want internet censorship, you should “move to North Korea.”
UK Prime Minister David Cameron recently made a decision that by the end of 2014, UK ISPs will automatically have porn filters switched on to protect children. Every household will need to choose by then whether or not they want it removed.
However, UK ISP Andrews and Arnold says they have no plans use the filter at all. They added, “sorry, for a censored internet you will have to pick a different ISP or move to North Korea.”
Internet censorship has been a big deal across the pond in the US for quite a while, so much so that the public petitioned to eliminate censorship programs such as SOPA and PIPA, which would have taken down popular websites if major corporations thought they violated their copyrights. Apparently now the UK is facing the same battle for different reasons.
The porn block is not something Andrews and Arnold is giving in to, as they have stated that their customers should be free to decide on porn filters without their ISPs making the decision for them by default. They say it's not their role to censor and track what you do with the internet. The UK ISP believes it is your responsibility to comply with the laws and regulations that apply to you.
A porn block, the UK ISP explains further, would give “restricted access to unpublished government mandated filter list… but still cannot guarantee kids don't access porn.” In fact, they say that the porn block would only create an even bigger problem, as people would create underground means to access what they want anyway.
Internet censorship, even government mandated, really solves nothing. As hackers have no doubt proven, if it can be built, it can be broken. No laws or restrictions will prove otherwise.
What do you think of the UK porn block? Is UK ISP Andrews and Arnold right to not give in to forced censorship?
BUDDING atheists wondering whether Richard Dawkins is in need of a little time away from Twitter to reflect on the past few weeks are about to have their (lack of) prayers answered.
The philosopher has managed to go one step further than their controversial comments on 'date rape versus stranger rape' to voice their opinions on what it would be ethical for a mother who is informed that their unborn child has Down Syndrome to do.
They started off their conversation with followers ethically enough, highlighting the plight of women in Ireland, where abortion is illegal, in light of the recent reports of the country's refusal to provide a safe abortion to a suicidal rape victim. They were forced to give birth.
"Ireland is a civilised country except in this 1 area," they tweeted, adding "You'd think the Roman Church would have lost all influence," to caption a link to a similar article.
Ireland is a civilised country except in this 1 area: http://t.co/i2PqFf6fYL You'd think the Roman Church would have lost all influence. — Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) August 20, 2014
But after engaging in conversation with a number of users, their ethical values appeared to come a little unstuck.
"994 human beings with Down's Syndrome deliberately killed before birth in England and Wales in 2012. Is that civilised?" @AidanMcCourt asked.
"Yes, it is very civilised. These are fetuses, diagnosed before they have human feelings," Dawkins responded.
"I honestly don't know what I would do if I were pregnant with a kid with Down Syndrome. Real ethical dilemma," @InYourFaceNYer chimed in.
"Abort it and try again. It would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice," they tweeted back.
@InYourFaceNYer Abort it and try again. It would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice. — Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) August 20, 2014
Naturally, their reasoning prompted a slew of further comments - and subsequent commentary:
@InYourFaceNYer People on that spectrum have a great deal to contribute, Maybe even an enhanced ability in some respects. DS not enhanced. — Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) August 20, 2014

Crowds are reportedly gathering in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine for a pro-Ukraine rally; estimates range from hundreds of people up to about 5,000. The action comes after Ukrainian forces clashed with pro-Russian separatists in the city of Mariupol, killing three militants and wounding 13. Ukraine is trying to restore order in the east, where officials say Russian special operatives are helping local separatists.
This appears to be a live stream of the rally:

It took a little over three hours, but the Labour Party has notched up a win – albeit on two wheels.
Whaleoil blogger Cameron Slater and Labour MP Trevor Mallard this afternoon donned their lycra, clicked into their pedals, and set-off on a 60km bike race around Auckland's eastern suburbs.
Mallard won by "five or six kilometres" according to Slater who admitted their nemesis got "a real good jump on me" on a big hill.
Dubbed "Whale vs Duck" by Slater, the race was sparked by a war of words that started with the blogger calling Mallard “a cripple”.
Mallard, an experienced cyclist who is recovering from a fractured femur and broken shoulder blade, retaliated in writing on the Labour Party's blog in May:
"Whaleoil has been less than complimentary on my rate of recovery. In fact they now refer to me as a cripple. Well let's get the challenge out there.
"Trevor v blubber boy 50 – 60k bike race, no motorbikes."
Slater didn't live up to their post-race post that boasted "yep, I am going to kick their arse tomorrow.”
"Remember this was all Trevor's clever idea. They challenged me. I simply accepted."
Pre-race comments posted on their blog ranged from the supportive “just don't let them sit on your wheel for 59.5km…good luck” to the empathetic.
“[Mallard] is now biologically-old, and had a fractured femur. I can tell you, the average recovery time from a fractured femur to be walking with out crutches or significant pain is six months minimum for an adult...So have a little mercy and be humble in your victory. After all, the old duck has had a broken wing and a broken leg.”
Today's 60km pedal-off started and finished in the Musick Point carpark, east Auckland.
A small crowd gathered in the carpark and waited for the duo to cross the finish line.
Slater, who said they had sore feet but was otherwise fine, indicated their competitive cycling days were over.
They said he'd been cycling only since the challenge was issued and they were by no means an expert.
"I won't be cycling any more."
There was a time not too long ago when it was commonly believed that Calgary wasn't a soccer city.
Over the past couple years, though, the emergence of Foothills FC as an annual contender in the PDL – North America's top development league – has shown that not only is Calgary's soccer culture alive and well but it's actually growing.
The Foothills squad's season ended earlier this week when they were knocked out in the first round of the PDL playoffs by the Portland Timbers.
It didn't manage to replicate last year's Cinderella run to the PDL finals, but head coach Tommy Wheeldon Jr. spoke proudly of their club's continued growth throughout 2017.
“Calgary was nowhere in soccer for a long time, and now we're keeping company with (the development teams for two MLS clubs: the Portland Timbers and the Seattle Sounders),” Wheeldon said. “The Sounders have come up here and haven't won against us in five games, and the Timbers, it took us going all the way down there for them to pip us.
“Our fanbase is growing, our product is growing, and on the field, we've got more points this year than last year.”
On the field, the Foothills crew was forced to deal with some challenging personnel issues this year, as breakout-player-in-waiting Elijah Adekugbe missed the entire season after suffering an Achilles tendon injury in pre-season, while Dominic Russo was only available for six games.
But with a focus squarely on developing local Calgarian talent, Wheeldon's team brought in younger players from their club's academy and still tied on points with the Portland Timbers under-23 team, although it wasofficially second in the Northwest Division on point-differential.
It all goes to show what Wheeldon believed before the club kicked-off for its first season in 2015: That there was talent in Calgary, and if that talent was given the opportunity, it would shine.
With talk growing louder about a domestic Canadian professional soccer league launching in the next year or two, the Foothills team is proving that Calgary would be an ideal landing spot for a franchise and that there is talent that is ready.
The club has already provided a pathway for the likes of Brad Kamden, Sean Melvin, Dominick Zator and Tyrin Hutchings to find professional employment, and the pipeline coming up through the program doesn't appear to be drying up anytime soon.
If and when a Canadian pro league does launch and a team finds it way to Calgary, it would appear that the on-field infrastructure is already in place for a competitive team to kick off on Day 1.
Off the field, there are still things to work out, though. The Foothills crew played its home games on their third new field in as many years in 2017, making the Calgary Soccer Centre their home after playing at Glenmore Field last year and debuting at Hellard Field in 2015.
“I think we've got the on-field product nailed, the results are speaking for themselves, and we're doing it with local players,” Wheeldon said. “But we've gotta have a home venue.”

In the early going, Rick Perry's top challenger for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination won't be any of the other Republican candidates. It will be Mr. Perry himself.
In August of 2011, the then-governor of Texas jumped into the 2012 presidential race late, fresh off back surgery, and, Perry admits, ill-prepared. A few months later, they uttered the “oops” heard ‘round the world in a debate, when they couldn't remember the third government agency they would abolish. Early in 2012, they dropped out of the race.
On Thursday, Perry will announce their second bid for the presidency. Their first task: overcoming their embarrassing first campaign.
“He starts off behind the starting line; he's got a lot to prove,” says Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of Texas in Austin. But “I can say that he's worked pretty assiduously to try to get up to speed on the issues this time. They show no sign of quit, and he's been able to marshal their financial supporters.”
Still, Mr. Buchanan adds, “it's going to be an uphill slog.”
Since last year, Perry has stressed that he's been doing their homework ahead of a possible second presidential run.
“Over the past 18 months, I have focused on being substantially better prepared,” Perry told reporters last June at a luncheon hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.
More recently, since leaving the governor's office in January after a record 14 years, Perry has laid out a rationale for a campaign. They have positioned themselves as a pragmatic executive willing to compromise – and an outsider who can bring change to a gridlocked capital.
Washington “has become a debating society that seldom solves problems,” Perry told the American Principles Project in Washington in February, according to Politico. “Governors have to make choices and take action. Americans have become cynical that Washington can ever change. And I am skeptical that an agent of change can come from Washington.”
Perry appeared to take aim at fellow Texan Ted Cruz, a hard-line conservative senator who is also running for president. “We must remember we are not electing a critic-in-chief, we are electing a commander-in-chief,” Perry said.
Henry Barbour, Republican national committeeman from Mississippi and an informal adviser to Perry for the past few years, says Perry's path to the nomination doesn't run through competing in any “brackets” or going after particular candidates, but in touting their record and their issue positions.
“The country is hungry for some performance out of the White House. We've had enough of hope and hype,” says Mr. Barbour in an interview. “Rick Perry brings record job growth, population growth, serious education achievements, and record graduation rates of minorities in Texas. There's been a lot of success.”
“Plus, he's authentic,” Barbour adds. “That's another contrast to President Obama and Mrs. Clinton.”
Unlike most in the Republican field, Perry brings military experience to the table. They served five years in the 1970s as a pilot in the Air Force, attaining the rank of captain. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) of South Carolina, who announced for president on Monday, is the only other veteran running. They served as a judge advocate in the Air Force during the 1980s.
Perry's military service could be a key argument to Republican voters, says GOP pollster Kellyannne Conway.
"More than any election since 1980, 2016 will be a national-security contest,” Ms. Conway told CNBC's Larry Kudlow in March.
In their speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Perry called for a more muscular foreign policy, warning that the Islamic State represents “the worst threat to freedom since communism.”
Right after they delivered their speech, their leadership political action committee, RickPAC, released an ad touting Perry's military service.
University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato notes Perry's “strong campaign team” as an advantage. In addition to Barbour, Perry has signed on Steve Schmidt, a former top aide to 2008 GOP nominee John McCain. Mr. Barbour's brother, Austin, another top GOP strategist in Mississippi, is leading Perry's super-PAC, the Opportunity and Freedom PAC.
Together, the Barbour brothers (nephews of former Gov. Haley Barbour (R) of Mississippi) were instrumental in fending off a strong tea party challenge to Sen. Thad Cochran (R) of Mississippi last year. Tea party activists are furious over Perry's association with the Barbours and Mr. Schmidt, but it's not clear how powerful the tea party “establishment” will be in the 2016 cycle.
In the end, the success or failure of Perry 2.0 will rest squarely on the candidate himself. They start with strong speaking and fundraising skills. Perry has recruited major donors to RickPAC, including some of the biggest fundraisers in Republican politics, according to The Washington Post.
Perry also has built networks of supporters in the early nominating states, Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, which they didn't do in 2011. And he's skilled on the stump.
“He's a very good platform performer,” says Buchanan from the University of Texas. “He's got as much going for them as a great lot of the rest of the mob on the Republican side.”

But that points to a major problem: the size of the GOP field, which could approach 20 people when the announcements are done. This field is also stronger than in 2012. As a prospective candidate, Perry has been polling down in the pack, in 10th place, according to the Real Clear Politics average. If they can stay in the top 10, they will qualify for the first debate on Aug. 6. But if they drop below 10th , that could kill their chances before the campaign really starts.
That's why the next two months are critical. Perry needs to build their national name recognition, and get their message out – that, in their view, they successfully governed the second-largest state for 14 years. There may also be comparisons to the last Texas governor to win the presidency: George W. Bush. But while that was viewed as a liability for Perry in 2012, it may be less so in the 2016 cycle, as time has softened memories and former President Bush's favorability ratings have improved.

Tom House was about as robust and independent as anyone could hope to be as an octogenarian. A former Marine, private pilot and insurance broker, they were still chopping wood and going on miles-long jogs at their retirement home in Sonoma, Calif., long after their 80th birthday, relatives told the Sacramento Bee.
But last year, congenital heart disease and colon cancer took a toll on their body. Given just months to live, the 94-year-old decided to end their lives on their own terms.
On a Monday last August, they spent the morning sharing memories with family and friends, according to NBC Bay Area. Then, with a doctor's prescription, they drank a fatal dose of barbiturates from their favorite coffee mug and chased it with a martini. Less than an hour later, they were dead.
“He did it their way,” their daughter-in-law Esther House told NBC, choking back tears. “He went out their way. They really did.”
House was one of 111 people in California who took their own lives in the first six months of the state's new right-to-die law, which allows terminally ill adults to request life-ending drugs from their doctors, according to a state health department report released Tuesday. The report offers the first snapshot of Californians who sought to end their lives under the legislation.
California enacted the End of Life Option Act on June 9 of last year amid heated debate over the ethics of permitting physicians to give lethal medications to patients suffering from malignant cancers and other terminal diseases. It is the fifth state in the country to enact right-to-die legislation, which was first adopted by Oregon in 1997.
[A terminally ill woman had one rule at their end-of-life party: No crying]
Between the day California's law took effect and Dec. 31, 2016, more than 250 people started what the law calls the “end-of-life option process,” making two verbal requests for aid-in-dying drugs, according to the report by the California Department of Public Health. Of those people, 191 received prescriptions written by 173 different physicians.
Health officials said 111 people ingested the drugs, killing themselves. Another 21 died of natural causes before taking the medication. It's not clear what happened to the remaining 59 people who received prescriptions, the report said.
(California Department of Public Health)
Those who ingested aid-in-dying drugs were mostly white, college-educated seniors who were receiving hospice or palliative care, according to the report. A little more than half were women.
Sixty-five people were suffering from malignant cancers, while 20 had neuromuscular disorders such as Parkinson's or Lou Gehrig's disease. Smaller numbers had heart or lung diseases, or other unspecified maladies.
There were six Asians, three blacks and three Hispanics, who ingested aid-in-dying drugs. The remaining 102 patients were white. Nearly all of them had insurance, most through Medicare or California's Medi-Cal program. The median age was 73. Nearly three-quarters of patients had received at least some college education, according to the report.
The report's findings mirror some statistics from Oregon, where the majority of patients last year were older than 65 and had terminal cancer. Although California is more racially diverse than Oregon, the vast majority of patients who took their own lives there last year were white, according to Oregon's 2016 report on the state's Death With Dignity Act.
California's law was passed last year in a special session of the state assembly after a campaign driven by stories of terminally ill patients who were unable to access aid-in-dying drugs in the state. One such patient was Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old with stage 4 brain cancer who moved to Oregon in 2014 to end their lives.
Compassion and Choices, a leading right-to-die advocacy group, said California's findings were good news for the law's supporters.
“The state's data show that even during the early months of the law's implementation, the law was working well and terminally ill Californians were able to take comfort in knowing that they had this option to peacefully end intolerable suffering,” Matt Whitaker, the group's California director, said in a statement Tuesday.
Critics of the law argue it is unethical for physicians to hasten death in anyone, and warn that it is virtually impossible to tell if drugs were prescribed to a depressed or unwilling patient. The Life Legal Defense Foundation, American Academy of Medical Ethics and a group of doctors has sued in federal court to overturn the law, arguing it violates Californians' civil rights by stripping terminally ill patients of certain legal protections and treating them differently than other patients.
“It's really tragic that doctors are now thinking that the best they can do for a patient is to give them a handful of barbiturates and leave them to their own devices,” Alexandra Snyder, an attorney with Life Legal Defense Foundation, told the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday.
John Minor, a retired psychologist from Manhattan Beach, Calif., was among those who killed themselves under the new law. They were an avid cyclist, runner and hiker until they were diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease, in their late 70s, as NPR reported earlier this month.
As Minor's body deteriorated to the point where they struggled to eat or speak, they asked for aid-in-dying drugs. But their doctors refused.
“I started cold-calling — like, just different hospitals and different departments within different hospitals,” Jackie Minor, their daughter, told NPR.
Finally, the family found them a health plan that would write them a prescription. Last September, at the age of 80, they drank a cup of apple juice mixed with a fatal dose of the pills and died quietly, surrounded by their relatives.
“John did what was right for him,” their wife, Sherry Minor, told the Los Angeles Times. “He died peacefully, rather than in agony, and they were in control. They didn't feel afraid or helpless.”

President-election's decision to back out of Trans-Pacific Partnership meets with dismay among supporters in Washington and friends of the US in the region
Donald Trump's vow to leave the Trans-Pacific Partnership has triggered a backlash among prominent supporters in Washington, who portrayed the decision as a strategic capitulation to China.
The US president elect, who campaigned on an anti-trade platform, said they would sign a note of intent on their first day in office, 20 January, to leave the TPP, a 12-nation trade deal that took the Obama administration seven years to negotiate.
“Instead we will negotiate fair bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back on to American shores,” Trump said.
Backers of the deal, including the country's former top military officer and Republican senators, argued that the TPP was not just an economic issue but a strategic one, and warned abandoning it could cost the US its leadership status in the Pacific.
The TPP excludes China, which declined to join, proposing its own rival version, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which excludes the US.
“I was a huge supporter of the TPP,” said retired admiral Mike Mullen, a former chairperson of the joint chiefs of staff. “What you see on the trade front post-election is China leaning in with its very nascent trade structure (RCEP) and saying: ‘Come join me.' And I think that giving China that kind of leverage is a disaster for the long run.”
The TPP was at the heart of Barack Obama's intended “pivot to Asia”, where they saw the best prospects for growth and the most decisive rivalry of the 21st century, between the US and China.
Many Republicans in Congress agree.
“This decision will forfeit the opportunity to promote American exports, reduce trade barriers, open new markets and protect American invention and innovation,” said Senator John McCain, who is already emerging as a bastion of congressional resistance to the future Trump administration.
“And it will create an opening for China to rewrite the economic rules of the road at the expense of American workers. Already China is intensifying its push for a new regional trade agreement, which excludes the United States.”

They Weiwen, vice-president of the Centre for China and Globalisation, said the Trump move represented an opening for Beijing. “We have been spending efforts for years to get (RCEP) done by end of this year or next,” they told CNBC.
Trump's election and their apparent determination to carry through on their TPP campaign promises came as a shock to US allies in the Pacific.
“America's prosperity has been built on a free and open market and participation of global economies,” the Australian ambassador to Washington, Joe Hockey, said in a speech in Detroit on Monday.
“So speaking as one mate to another, I can say emphatically that free trade is in your best interests.
“We look forward to the opportunity to provide perspectives from the other side of the world to a new administration that has a look at trade and policy. We don't believe that America in its heart has changed its view in relation to free trade but we recognize that there is a certain level of introspection going on.”
On a visit to Buenos Aires, meanwhile, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the TPP would be “meaningless” without the US.
However, Christopher Hill, a former assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, said the stalling of the TPP did not necessarily imply a wholesale shift to China's RCEP.
Major US allies were unlikely to make their trade relationships in the region entirely beholden to Beijing, they argued.
“Having been to many of the countries in the TPP, I don't think they are prepared to throw it out of the window and choose China,” said Hill, now dean of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver.
“Most of those countries have familiarity with China and don't want to go back to being tributary states. They've been there, done that.”
Hill was more worried about other threats Trump made during the campaign, during which the president-elect accused China of cheating in its trade relations, to the detriment of the US resulting, in “the greatest theft in the history of the world”.
To rectify the situation, Trump said, they would label China a “currency manipulator” and put a 45% tariff on Chinese imports.
“Then we enter a full-blown trade war,” Hill said. “We are in uncharted waters.”
The Supreme Court case concerns something called the "first-sale doctrine" in copyright law. Simply put, the doctrine means that you can buy and sell the stuff you purchase. Even if someone has copyright over some piece of your stuff, you can sell it without permission from the copyright holder because the copyright holder can only control the "first-sale." The Supreme Court has recognized this doctrine since 1908.
To use a classic example, imagine you buy a novel by Sabina Murray. Sabina owns the copyright to the book, so you can't make a copy of the book. But you bought a copy of the book, and can sell the copy to anyone who'll pay you for it. You can sell it to a neighbor, to a fellow student, or to someone else on Craigslist or on eBay.
But the first-sale rule doesn't just make it possible to sell your books and other creative works like CDs, paintings, or DVDs. Almost every product made now has a copyright logo on it. That logo, alone, empowers manufacturers to sue people for copyright infringement for unlawful sales.
The first-sale doctrine is one thing that makes it lawful to sell almost any good. The companies that have gone to court and sued over selling their "copyrights" include a watchmaker and shampoo producer. They have gone to court arguing that one part of the Copyright Act -- which gives them a right against unauthorized imports -- invalidates the first-sale doctrine.
In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the first-sale doctrine applies to any product manufactured in the United States, sold in the U.S., even if the first sale by the copyright holder was abroad and the item was imported back into the U.S. This decision was unanimous and rejected the interpretation preferred by the U.S. government's lawyer -- and the biggest copyright holders.
The legal confusion today concerns only products made abroad.
Continuing a long string of similar cases, the Supreme Court will review a New York federal court decision that decided, in short, that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to any copyrighted product manufactured abroad. That case concerns textbooks.
John Wiley & Sons, a textbook publisher, sells expensive versions of the textbooks here and less expensive versions abroad. Supap Kirtsaeng, a foreign graduate student at University of Southern California, decided to help pay for their schooling by having relatives buy them copies of the foreign versions abroad, send them to him, whereupon he'd sell those books on eBay to willing students. He'd make money, the students would save money, but Wiley might have fewer sales of its pricey American versions. The case is styled Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons.
Both the District and Second Circuit courts held that any product manufactured abroad is not subject to the first-sale doctrine. For instance, that iPad you sold. You noticed this statement: "Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China." Same for the iPods you've owned, the iPhones, and the MacBooks. Because those products were manufactured abroad, according to the Second Circuit, the first-sale doctrine doesn't apply to them. You need the permission of every copyright holder to sell the iPad.
As much as the win will certainly help the Jazz in this series, they apparently will see Gobert again in this series, given the lack of severity to their injury. Their contribution will be crucial; Gobert provides much-needed rim protection and their offensive game has steadily improved this season.
 They are a vivid example of Utah's talent development blueprint, a gangly 7-footer from France who wasn't projected as a premier big man, but given the time and patience to prove otherwise. The 27th pick in 2013, Gobert was lavished with a rich contract extension before this season and then posted career average highs in points (14.0, with a career-high 35 against the Knicks), rebounds (12.8) and blocks (2.6), the last two among the NBA leaders.
Despite losing Gobert in Game 1, the Jazz stole the opener by playing a disciplined game, giving themselves a chance to win at the end and refusing to play the role of victim without their starting center.
“We felt and knew that a lot of people were counting us out when they went down,” said Johnson.
Throughout their career, Johnson made a habit of taking crucial shots, first in Phoenix, then Atlanta and even with the Brooklyn Nets even though their level of play began to slip with age. The Jazz signed them as a free agent to add to their young mix and bring experience, which was helpful Saturday night in LA with the game on the line. Johnson went isolation on Jamal Crawford and then used an inside move to score over Crawford and a late-arriving DeAndre Jordan. Their 21st point led the Jazz in scoring.
Not only did Jazz coach Quin Snyder keep Johnson on the floor, the coach refused to call timeout after Chris Paul tied the game at 95-all with 13 seconds left, electing to keep the Clippers from setting up defensively.
Utah is expected to provide an update on Gobert's condition sometime Sunday.
It all came down to this. The final matchday of the season, and a chance for Milan to secure European competition for the first time since 2013.
A victory at home to Roma would propel the club at minimum one point above challengers Sassuolo, guaranteeing 6th place and a Europa League qualifying spot regardless of the result in the Coppa Italia final.
Fans were ready to get the taste of victory back onto their tongues, and confidence was high prior to the start of the match. Even some of the more skeptical supporters, those who went into the season predicting a mid-table finish, were in uncharacteristically high spirits. In the words of journalist Tancredi Palmeri, “everything seemed to be set”.
As the whistle blew for the final time to seal the match, all the happiness and confidence with which fans approached the tie was obliterated. Roma stood on the smoldering ruins of Milan as conquerors, much like the Roman Empire did nearly 2300 years ago.
Though the result was a hefty 3-1 defeat, it did little to accurately portray the extent to which the Giallorossi walked all over the Rossoneri. Had it not been for a few choice saves from Gianluigi Donnarumma coupled with several scuffed chances on Roma's side, the final score could easily have been inflated by three or four goals for the visitors.
The match had next to no redeeming qualities on the home side, a feat for even the oft-despicable Milan of the last three years. The team showed no confidence, no drive, and no desire to fight for the club's rightful place in continental competition.
THE GOOD
It says a lot about a club if after investing €90 million over the summer its best player has not even completed their secondary education. Milan's Gianluigi Donnarumma has been a freak of nature ever since being handed the #1 position by Sinisa Mihajlovic, and against Roma they showcased one of their best performances. Making six saves, including an acrobatic arm's reach deflection on a rare Roma indirect free kick, they were a huge factor in limiting the damage Giallorossi attackers were able to cause. The youngster's large frame and quick reflexes denied Miralem Pjanic and Mohamed Salah on several occasions, a solitary figure standing up to Roma forwards as Milan's defense crumpled attack after attack.
Juraj Kucka also put in a solid, if not great, 90 minutes. They were a defensive might, completing all seven of their attempted tackles as well as intercepting four Roma passes. A thorn in their opponent's side, Kucka may have been unwieldy when on the ball, but off of it they made life as difficult as they could for the visiting forwards. Kucka's tenacity shut down lightning-quick Giallorossi multiple times throughout the 90 minutes, and the Slovakian often ended up covering for their incapable midfield partners.
Much like Nigel De Jong before him, Kucka was stuck doing the defensive work of three players, and as a result of being stretched thin made occasional errors. Though mistakes of any kind are not easily forgiven considering the overall outcome of the match and the importance it held, blame on Kucka has certainly been less than that on Locatelli or Alex.
THE BAD
In a match such as this, the line between bad and ugly is stretched thin. Elements from either category could be placed in either one and still been valid, which makes distinguishing what merits what quite tough. The sections could have been welded together, creating a horrible alloy of disappointment and anguish. However, in the spirit of preserving the soul of the article, the three categories remain. In this particular sector, the inexcusable player performances will be dissected, while the ‘Ugly' will discuss the team as a whole.
The worst performer on the pitch was unquestionably Manuel Locatelli. The 18-year-old was handed their very first Rossoneri start for this match, a decision that is certainly regretted by manager Cristian Brocchi. Looking shaky in their opening debut minutes, it all culminated in a terribly placed pass that was quickly intercepted by a Roma player. Several passes later, and Roma had themselves their first goal of the match, a beautiful lifted ball from Pjanic which found an onrushing Salah, who easily slotted it past Donnarumma.
Locatelli's shakes continued, and being near-solely responsible for Roma's opening goal ruined any chances for the youngster to make a positive impact on the match. A zero-factor on the defensive side and somehow less effective on the rare Milan offensive play, Locatelli remaining on the pitch for the entire 90 minutes was beyond inexplicable. Giving away the ball several times and picking up a needless yellow card, it seems in Milan's best interests to not let the youngster near the first team for the foreseeable future.
Keisuke Honda, who many fans thought was having a renaissance earlier in the campaign, contributed yet another shameful hour and a half in red and black. As Milan's #10, it was expected that they would provide for Balotelli and Bacca, while going forward themselves and trying for the occasional accurately placed long shot. Against Roma, they did nothing remotely resemble their assigned duties.
Blasting all their chances either out of the stadium or straight into the hands of Szczesny, including one in the second half for which they had all the space in the world to place correctly, the Japanese international played like a man who did not care which way the outcome went. They were unenthusiastic, lazy, and a drag on the entire team. The fact that the player primarily responsible for ball distribution completed less than 30 passes over the course of the game outlines just how unfit Honda is for the starting 11, and the absurdity of them getting first team minutes week after week.
Uncharacteristically, Alessio Romagnoli also contributed a poor performance. Normally fielded at center back alongside a senior defender, against Roma they were moved to the left back position. Clearly out of their element, the youngster's rawness and rigidity on the left flank very clearly left its mark. Outpaced by Mohamed Salah and drifting towards the center more often than not, the Italian was partly at fault for Salah's goal in the opening 20 minutes. Romagnoli was neither able to properly mark their Egyptian counterpart, nor chase them down after the forward received Pjanic's lobbed pass.
Alex, normally a defensive rock, looked unusually dire against Roma. Heralded as one of Milan's best defenders this season, they were thoroughly taken apart by Roma's wiley attackers, and was eventually subbed off for Davide Calabria with 25 minutes left in the match. Their positioning was all over the place, and they did little to pressure El Shaarawy the rest of the dynamic Giallorossi players near the box. As a result of this, Roma players were able to play multiple passes to each other even in Milan's box, leading to chance after chance for the visitors.
Big lapses are rare for the Brazilian, but when they happen, you rather have a teenager on the pitch than the veteran center back. And with Alex reportedly on the way out this summer, this performance has lowered their stock as a player that must be retained at all costs.
The criticism, however, cannot be placed exclusively on the hands of the players. For all poor results, the manager is responsible for bearing a portion of the blame. Cristian Brocchi made some questionable inclusions for the match, including the incomprehensible decision to start Locatelli as the central of three midfielders. While Milan's midfield options are far from envious ones, players like Montolivo, Mauri, or even Poli were better choices to start. Fielding a player with no professional experience in the most important match of a club's campaign is asking for trouble, and Brocchi got exactly what the most likely outcome of their selection would bring.
Substituting Balotelli off after the first half was another nonsensical move from the fledgeling manager. The oncoming Luiz Adriano effectively reduced Milan to ten men, such was their lack of contribution towards anything remotely productive. Balotelli, while certainly not the best player of the opening 45 minutes, at minimum put in effort to drop deep and receive passes for them and Bacca to work with. Adriano, in contrast, seemed to be more preoccupied with making sure they wouldn't get out of breath than shifting the score to their side's favor.
THE UGLY
A recurring member of this section reared its head once again during the Roma match, in a splendor that eclipsed even the meltdown against Sassuolo in March. Milan, for the umpteenth time, were amateur in their tactical play. Sitting back in defense from the very start of the match, the Rossoneri played like a small team aiming for an unlikely draw against a European giant that would send them to the final of the Champions League. The players didn't show the fight that Sassuolo did in their 3-1 dismantling of Inter going on at the same time, and as a result, Roma had all the space and time in the world to eventually break down the home side's back line.
The defensive pressing and pressure was nearly nonexistent, and defenders seemed hostile to the idea of tightly marking their opponents. For instance, on Roma's second goal, Milan defenders were tasked with shutting down two Giallorossi attackers running down the right flank, preventing Miralem Pjanic from making a killer pass.
Instead of keeping up with the onrushing players, the Milan defenders closest to them first slowed down, and then for reasons unknown, rather than attempt to catch up, started moving towards the center of the pitch. While Alessio Romagnoli made an attempt to chance down Salah a few seconds later, the damage was done, and the Egyptian scored what was certainly one of their easiest goals of the season.
Another example of defensive incompetence arrived with Miralem Pjanic's first attempt on target.
After making a bombing run down their right flank, they gave a quick through pass to Mohamed Salah despite being closed off by four defenders. Salah then gave the ball back to the Bosnian, who for some reason was wide open at the top of the Milan box just moments after having over a third of the Milan outfield on their tail.
Seconds apart, these two situations very clearly show the failings of Milan's tactics. Going from four defenders marking a major Roma player to just one (who is slowing down, not thinking Pjanic is a threat) is unacceptable, especially given Pjanic's abilities and the dangerous open space they are moving into after giving Salah the ball.
Here, the inattention to proper marking is made almost impossibly clear. Salah, a danger man, has no Milan players within five yards of him, and neither does the Roma player who sends the ball up to the Egyptian. Milan put no effort into shutting down the danger man here, shamefully allowing them to do as they liked.
Possibly the most embarrassing piece of Rossoneri defensive work came alongside Stephan El Shaarawy's goal in the second half. Roma midfielders by this stage in the match had free reign to do as they pleased, with their opponents more preoccupied with hugging the 18-yard line than closing them down.
At the top of the box El Shaarawy, unimpeded, calmly walked up to a space between two Milan defenders. Then, as those same defenders watched, they burst into the box. Not a single Rossoneri player lifted a finger to stop the sequence from happening. The previously mentioned defenders, who were in perfect position to chase them down and prevent the goal, watched slackjawed as the Roma man easily placed their shot past Donnarumma.
These are just a small selection of scenarios where Milan found themselves tactically akin to a Sunday league youth team. But beyond these failings, another, possibly more important one, took place. It did not take place on the pitch, but instead in the minds of the management.
Christian Abbiati, a loyal servant of the club for nearly twenty years, was retiring at the end of this season, and the Roma match was to be their last home Serie A match ever. It was unrealistic to expect that they would start the match, as Donnarumma gave no reason to doubt their abilities. However, as the referee blew the final whistle, Abbiati found themselves not on the pitch, but on the bench. Not even given the courtesy of a late substitute appearance in order to seal out their final match on the pitch, Brocchi instead decided that making unnecessary substitutions was the best way to honor the club's loyal servant.
Although, in a way it made sense. The Milan of the last few years has not been the type to honor its dedicated players, first sending Pirlo off to Juventus with nothing more than a pen and a kick in the backside, then cutting ties with players like Gattuso, Inzaghi, Nesta, and Seedorf in its 2012 summer exodus, and finally in 2013 getting rid of Ambrosini, one of Milan's best players of the 2012/13 season, without giving them the respect of retiring with their beloved club.
While this is not new territory for the Rossoneri, it is by no means acceptable, and highlights just how broken the club and its spirit, its identity, truly is. It will take a miracle for Milan to return to the same heights, and an even bigger one to return there with some semblance of its identity intact.
Milan fans are now faced with a difficult question: If future success will cost the club everything it stands for, will it be worth it?
A Pennsylvania newspaper on Friday apologised for publishing an editorial cartoon that compared aeroplane seating conditions to those on slave ships.
In-flight arguments overcrowded conditions and reclinable seats, some forcing flights to divert and land, have recently contributed to a spate of media stories and debate.
The Lancaster Online president, John A Kirkpatrick III, and executive editor, Barb Roda, said in a statement they were “deeply sorry” for publishing the since-deleted cartoon, which compared the cramped conditions on planes to the dehumanising conditions on ships that brought slaves to the US.
“To somehow link the inconveniences of air travel with slavery in general and the slave ships in particular was not only just plain wrong it was deeply hurtful to our African American community and all those who understand the horrors inflicted on the men and women forced into the slave trade,” the statement said. “It both trivialised and demeaned their experience.”
The statement also includes a brief lesson on the actual conditions of life on slave ships.
The cartoon appeared in the newspaper's Saturday edition last week. On Monday, the newspaper held a meeting with community members to let them know they planned to apologise for running the image.
The cartoon was nationally syndicated, and not created by Lancaster Online staff. Any newspaper that has a deal with the syndication company could have published the image.
“While the editorial cartoon was not drawn by someone on our staff, the decision to run it on our pages was made here,” the statement said. “We are deeply sorry about printing this offensive cartoon.”
At least one small newspaper, the Sheboygan Press in Wisconsin, also ran the image. Two days later, it published a letter from local pastor Justin Sembler that condemned the cartoon:
“I have flown commercial and in coach seating many times in the course of my life. Sometimes it's pleasant, sometimes not. We all have dealt with cramped leg space, cheap snacks and the occasional obnoxious passenger.
“In all of my time flying, I have never once compared my experience to that of a slave ship hold. To do so is not only disrespectful, but it sells far short the horrific conditions that I imagine when I look at that famous scene depicted in your cartoon.”
Seventy-five million dollars might seem like a lot of money, but it's chump change for Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek, who injected as much cash into Impossible Foods, a seemingly unknown California company. The ambitious startup is trying to change the paradigm of the global food system via one product -- a burger.
Sure, it is plant-based but it smells, cooks, tastes, and even bleeds like the real deal.
On social media, the hashtag #impossibleburger has been trending. Last year critically-acclaimed celebrity chef and tastemaker David Chang was the first to introduce the product to their Momofuku Nishi menu. Today, the faux ground beef can be found in 44 restaurants across the United States, and is expected to be in hundreds in the next few months.
“We believe we created a consumer movement that we need to fulfill,” said David Lee, COO and CFO of Impossible Foods.
Asian investors pile in
Temasek is not the first Asian company to express interest in the meat substitute. One of Asia's richest men, Li Ka-Shing was also an early investor in Impossible Foods. Series D funding came from UBS Wealth Management in Asia as well.
So why are such savvy investors betting on a product not even available in the region?
“We look for opportunities to support growth across our portfolio,” says Paul Ewing-Chow, associate director of public affairs at Temasek. “This includes technology pioneers and disruptors, and in the case of Impossible Foods -- food security.”
Singapore is a small country with limited arable land. Less than 1% of the island nation's GDP comes from domestic food production. The city-state devotes its resources to growing produce with little farming activity in livestock. Consequently, the population's diet is almost entirely dependent on imports.
China's food security dilemma
Neighboring China faces a similar dilemma. It has 1.3 billion mouths to feed, but only 7% of the world's arable land. President Xi Jinping has said that food security is an eternal challenge for the country. Adding to the pressure is the growing demand for a “rich country diet,” which means more animal protein and dairy. Rabobank estimates China's meat imports, across beef, pork, and poultry will increase steadily in the coming years.
Naturally, China has been actively looking for solutions to secure its future food supply.
The country spent $43 billion earlier this year to purchase Swiss seeds company Syngenta. The acquisition by state-owned ChemChina marks the largest acquisition ever of a foreign business. The deal will ensure the nation never runs out of Chinese staples such as rice and noodles to feed its people, but more importantly it ensures there's plenty of grain to raise enough animals to meet the exponential demand.
Impossibly better for the environment
What Impossible Foods offers Singapore, China -- and the world at large -- is an alternative solution to meeting market needs. The current way of cattle farming puts tremendous strain on the environment.
In contrast, production of Impossible burger patties require 95% less land, a quarter of the water, and produces only an eighth of the greenhouse gases compared to regular beef patties, according to the company.

“They're strategically seeing the opportunity that serving sustainable food creates,” said Lee about Temasek's investment. The former Del Monte Foods executive explains how protein is considered an aspirational good even before material items in some parts of the world: "The market we're addressing is very relevant in particular for the emerging middle class and growing economies of Asia."
To achieve the same meaty flavor, Impossible Foods extracts heme that carries iron from plants. Heme is abundant in meat, but also present in greens, seeds and grains. It's a flavor catalyst and the ingredient that gives the product its red color.
Deodorized coconut oil is used to mimic the natural fats, so that the patties sizzle and caramelize to form a crust when cooked. “We chose to be radically transparent [with our ingredients] because that's just the way we roll,” Lee said.
Finding the right time for Asia
Impossible Foods does have a timeline for Asia, but it hasn't been disclosed yet. Right now, its operation out of Rutgers Food Innovation Center in New Jersey produces 8,000 pounds of plant-based "meat each month, not nearly enough to meet domestic demand in the U.S.
The company has been working to launch a facility in Oakland, California, set to open in the fall, which will increase supply by 250 times and allow Impossible Foods to service thousands of restaurants across the states.
But whether the ground meat substitute will stay in burger form is completely left to the discretion of each chef.
So far, the product has been used for bolognese, meatloaf, tacos and even raw tartare. New interpretations on how to cook the product have already made it into Asian dishes such as mapo tofu, crispy lettuce cups and Moroccan cigars, similar to a Chinese spring roll.
While still in the works, Lee points out that Impossible Foods also has the platform to create pork, chicken, fish and dairy. They're just simply not available to consumers yet.
Their latest taste test? “I tried our product as ground pork in dumpling.” The idea is, the versatile product can be prepared to suit local taste. “For Asian consumers, we'll serve it the way they want it," Lee says.

In January, employment rose in six provinces, led by Ontario (+41,000) and Quebec (+16,000), while it fell in Alberta (-16,000) and Saskatchewan (-2,800). Little changes were observed in British Columbia and Prince Edward Island.
Compared with December, employment advanced in wholesale and retail trade (+34,000); professional, scientific and technical services (+29,000) and public administration (+21,000). At the same time, fewer people worked in accommodation and food services (-15,000).
In January, the number of employees increased by 112,000 in the private sector, while it was little changed in the public sector for the third consecutive month. At the same time, the number of self-employed declined by 61,000.
In January, employment among people aged 55 years and older was little changed, as an increase among men (+28,000) was partially offset by a decline among women (-18,000). The unemployment rate was little changed for both older women (4.7%) and older men (5.5%). Meanwhile, the number of employed youth aged 15 to 24 was up 53,000 in January.
The labour force participation rate went up to 65.6 percent in January from 65.4 percent in December.

h&F: You used Vietnam as an example of great war photography. What changed and why?
SHIELDS: One is the brilliant military move of keeping your friends close and enemies closer. Basically, the government embedded journalists and photojournalists with combat troops so, on the one hand, you're gaining access, but on the other you have huge amounts of censorship and self-censorship. Starting with the Gulf War, you see the Times' war photography move from more ambitious Pulitzer-prize winning photography by Eddie Adams in Vietnam—the famous pic of the girl running naked through napalm—those pics seem to me increasingly less likely, almost impossible in the current times ecology. I think another factor is right wing propaganda machines are on the lookout for any organization whether it's NPR or the Times to show any kind of left bias.
Right wing think tanks are pushing things towards the center, or the center-right, I think you can't overestimate the ubiquity of the web so that pics can get disseminated immediately from a foxhole to the Times and back within a second. Therefore, pics can effectively be vetted by the very troops that the photographer is embedded with.
I think that this kind of odd intersection of military industrial media complex in which the Times try to hold onto its brand by having the ear of the government, and part of the courtship of the government so that the Times can gain access is, to me, whether consciously or unconsciously, to run pics that are problematically respectful, dignified, noble, airbrushed. Yes, on page 38 at the end of a story there might be a paragraph that talks about the cost of war, but boy that lead picture is going to frame the whole discussion as an essentially dignified and noble and above all worthy sacrifice. From 1974, '73, '72 they were running sometimes astonishingly visceral Vietnam pics. Then, they started to run color as of '97, pushing it toward a more pictorial tradition. Hickey points this out really well: “Basically flying dirt of World War II became flying paint of abstract expressionism." All of these photographers have gone to school with all of these modernist masterpieces. Warhol, Johns, Rauschenberg, Pollock, Rothko, and all of these photographers and photo editors have been hugely schooled in the last 40 years on 20th-century pictorial masterpieces or master artists. The photographers are running footnotes of these paintings. In my slightly paranoid reading, they're no longer sort of seeing what's on the ground. They're trying to find a picture that looks like a faint copy of a Jackson Pollock.
It's ok if you're running a sort of swooning beauty of the Christmas tree at Rockefeller center to make tourists come to New York. Ok, no harm was done.
But when you're essentially selling, moving lambs led to slaughter, this is how consent gets manufactured. That's real and that counts and the Times has a megaphone responsibility and capability that the Des Moines Register doesn't have.
News4's Scott MacFarlane asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about the Russia investigation and Rosenstein said they were satisfied with its progress thus far. (Published Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2017)
The U.S. Department of Justice official who appointed special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election said they are satisfied with the special counsel's work.
When the News4 I-Team asked Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein if they were satisfied with the work thus far of the U.S. Office of the Special Counsel, Rosenstein said yes.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly called the Russia probe a politically motivated "witchhunt." Only Rosenstein would have the authority to fire Mueller.
Rosenstein, a longtime former U.S. attorney in Maryland, told the I-Team in an interview Monday that they were limited in explaining why they were satisfied with the special counsel's work.
Deputy AG: No Reason to Fire Mueller
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appeared before a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee and said they have seen no basis for firing special counsel Robert Mueller, who is overseeing the Russia investigation. (Published Tuesday, June 13, 2017)
“When we conduct criminal investigations -- just as was true in Maryland - we don't talk about the investigation while it's ongoing," they said. "So what the American people will see is only if and when a case is charged. And there are several cases that have been charged to date.”
At least four people have been charged with violating federal law by the special counsel's office, including former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign chairperson Paul Manafort. The charges are pending in D.C. federal court.
White House attorney Ty Cobb said they have "great respect for Robert Mueller."
"We remain committed to working with them toward a speedy and appropriate resolution," they continued.
The special counsel's office declined to comment on Rosenstein's remarks.
Rosenstein has oversight over the special counsel because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused themselves from the Russia investigation. Rosenstein formally approved the appointment of Mueller.
AG Rosenstein Praises Sessions at Crime Summit
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein voiced strong support for law enforcement, as well as praise for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, during an address at Tuesday's National Summit on Crime Reduction and Public Safety. (Published Tuesday, June 20, 2017)
They said their team is accountable for the work of Mueller and the special counsel team.
“The Office of Special Counsel, as you know, has a degree of autonomy from the Department of Justice. But there is appropriate oversight by the department. That includes budget. But it also includes certain other details of the office. It is part of the Department of Justice. And we're accountable for it.”
The U.S. House Judiciary Committee announced Wednesday afternoon that Rosenstein will testify before the committee on Dec. 13.

CRACKDOWN: South Korean prostitutes in underwear and covered in body and face paint, douse themselves in flammable liquid in an apparent attempt to burn themselves after a rally in Seoul, South Korea.
Hundreds of prostitutes and pimps rallied Tuesday near a red-light district in Seoul to protest a police crackdown on brothels, with some unsuccessfully attempting to set themselves on fire.
A crowd of about 400 people, mostly women wearing baseball caps, masks and sunglasses, chanted slogans like, "Guarantee the right to live!" during the four-hour rally.
At one point, about 20 protesters in their underwear and covered in body and face paint doused themselves in flammable liquid in an apparent attempt to burn themselves, but others stopped them from lighting any flames. Some of the women then sat in the street and wept and screamed, while other protesters consoled them.
Minor scuffles between protesters and police officers erupted after the rally, but there were no reports of major injuries.
Prostitution is illegal in South Korea but is widespread despite repeated government crackdowns.
The rally comes weeks after officials began stationing police cars near brothels in a bid to drive away people looking to pay for sex.
The sex workers accuse a nearby department store of pushing police to take such measures. Police deny the claim.
As part of their protest, a group of prostitutes on Sunday tried to buy expensive items at the department store with only coins; when they were rejected, they placed large piles of coins on the department store's floors.
Ajit Pai thinks net neutrality held us all back. It stifled innovation, they said. It deprived consumers of choices, starved rural communities of broadband, and even threatened the survival of the internet itself. Pai, who lobbied for Verizon before Barack Obama appointed them to the Federal Communications Commission, has prioritized the repeal of Obama-era net neutrality rules since becoming its chairperson under President Donald Trump. Considering Pai's background in the telecommunications industry, which has long wanted more control over how it delivers internet content, it makes sense that they have targeted the rules classifying internet service providers as Title II carriers, which subjected them to stricter regulation and prohibited providers from creating “fast lanes” that users could access for a fee. On Thursday afternoon, the FCC voted 3-2 to repeal the rules, and Pai killed their dragon.
“You can still drive memes right into the ground,” they joked in a Daily Caller video released ahead of the FCC vote. Pai's jocularity, however, hides a more sinister truth: Their war on net neutrality is an extension of the Trump administration's war against the working class. Their justifications are the same justifications put forward in any defense of deregulation, whether it's in the financial industry or the oil and gas sector. The result is the same: More profits for companies, with dubious benefits for consumers. Corporations exist to make money, and making the internet as cheap and accessible as possible is not in their financial interests. They certainly are not in the business of making sure the people with the least disposable income, or who live the farthest away, can get internet access.
In conversations with The New Republic, net neutrality advocates expressed deep concern about the FCC's vote. “You can't even get a job at Walmart without having reliable internet access, let alone do a complicated homework assignment or find a great health care plan,” said Hannah Sassaman, policy director for the Media Mobilizing Project. “All of the basic pieces of dignity that most of us who have reliable and affordable internet take for granted go completely out the window without net neutrality.”
The impact on rural communities could be particularly severe. The FCC itself found in 2016 that 39 percent of rural Americans lack access to internet speeds of at least 25 Mbps. That figure increases to 41 percent for Americans living in tribal territory and it's higher still—68 percent—for anyone living in rural tribal territory. “Without net neutrality rural residents will experience another form of systemic oppression and discrimination, I just know it,” said Dr. Jacquelyn Bragg, coordinator of the Community Economic Development Network of East Tennessee. “It is critically essential to economic development.”
Confrontations!
One girl from my work was constantly making jokes about other male colleague. They were okay with it, as they were talkative and more or less positive. One day, they were having a tantrum. Typical bad day. They were trying to cheer them up. They offered to give them some vitamin C as they were starting to have a cold. They refused, saying that “she doesn't do pills” (lol). Ten minutes later they saw them coming to their desk with a huge plate full of doughnuts. They joked and said that “well, you don't want vitamin pills but you do want sugar, don't ya?”. It was said with a tone clearly saying it's only a joke. They went mad. They started telling them that they should concentrate on their own life and they know shit about them and what they eat. Feels like a typical “Weak spot hit”, am I right? 😉 Do I need to add that it is usually them who comments on everything in the exact same way as the joke that was laid out by my colleague? But everyone lives up with it because they are a girl.
They stopped talking with them It's now a second week and they never says anything to them either. Even that it was their fault to react like this and they told them to “stop behaving like that because they do not have time for drama”. I wonder how long this will last, because they not only doesn't talk to them on a personal level but also on a professional one. It's funny because they work in the same team. They should apologize to them and communicate as an adult, am I right or am I right? 😉
Women… They are all Ugly.
Remove make up. Stop telling them that they should shave. They are doing it only because other women are. And because we teach them. Cut their long hair off. Suddenly, what you have left is a stinky human being with hairy armpits, hairy legs, hairy ass and of course a lot of fat here and there. Plus a cunt between their legs. This is the object of your desire, gentlemen. Painted, “maked up” and covered in fragrances and perfumes so that you won't notice who they really are. Think about it next time you are desiring that sweaty human who controls you by the fact that they have a hole in their body and you want to put your sensitive dong in there. D'oh! We are so stupid! And this is not to say I hate woman. Before you call me a misogynist (like I would care, though!). I love them, in a way! I love how they smell, how their pussy tastes. Especially young, fresh pussy. I love their bodies, I love to fuck them. This is how nature made me. I am not ashamed by who I am. But also this is why I am de-programming myself through realistic observation like this. This allows me to look at them for who they really are- biologically driven wombs with attached brain, programmed to look for the best condition to breed and clone themselves (in order to extend our species- but that's not how they see it, obviously!). This is it. There's no magic about it. There's no love. Wake up, guys!
Of course, prostitution would be an answer but it doesn't produce female validation. Of course, PUA's are saying that it's received when a girl gives you their ass on their own – without paying them a dime. But, you are always paying them – whether it's your time, effort and money spent on drinks, going out etc. it doesn't matter. Ultimately, even if PUA would really work it's not worth it to base your temporary happiness on some external source, on something that can only be received externally – that is : female validation coming from a woman. We should work on ways to limit down the exposure and influence of female validation and find other ways to make ourselves happy. Turning around my whole life around women as PUAs do is just madness. I am never going to be able to be with a woman in a “normal” LTR ever again. My knowledge cannot be erased. Maybe when I'm 60-70 and just old? Who knows. But not now… am I right or am I right? 😉
We Don't Have Much Time
Don't forget that we don't have much time in our lives. What seemed like an eternity when we were teenagers and an extremely long period of time when we were in our 20s already feels like accelerating car in our 30s … and probably that car will be going high-speed when we would be in our 40s and so on… Perception of time speeds up as we grow older. This means that we have limited number of years to make mistakes. That includes relationship mistakes. If you don't learn your lessons as a man during first one, two or maybe three long term relationships – you are basically fucked. I've learned mine after four of them. It took me way too long. But I did it. Here I am. And yet, I know people in their 40s who don't know shit about women. Some of them cannot be saved. Some will learn the hard way. Also, I was lucky. No “accidental” pregnancy or marriage. Now I know that I am free and won't allow any female to catch me. Even one of those tempting fresh 23 year olds with bodies to die for. 😉
But my point is simple – if you're in a fucked up toxic relationship, you are wasting your time. And time is the most valuable resource we have. It's not worth it. So if you're going to learn – do it fast. We don't have much time to spend years and years in our life whilst remaining in shitty relationships. We get older. What was fun in our 20s doesn't make us happy when we are 30+ … so – choose wisely. And always be yourself.
Masks.
They all wear it. The amount of people- both men and women, that are toxic, fucked up, twisted, undeveloped or simply pure assholes is just INCREDIBLE. I am baffled everyday, when I discover how fucked up is person after person. The ones that are healthy, positive and normal/sane can be counted on one hand.
Masks are just that- masks. They can be uncovered by a skilled observer. All signals coming from different perception channels: micro-expressions, body language, what and how they say something, energy which you can feel coming from them are being constantly analyzed and judged by your own inner system called Intuition. Whether you're living a life healthy enough to sense, hear and recognize your own intuitive voice (which always whispers in your ear in your own voice) – is up to you, but it's ultimately worth it.
I was talking with a girl, 1:1 today – at my work place. It was our first conversation like that. Before, they always smiled and waved ‘hello‘ when I was passing them During first few minutes of that conversation I've spotted a lot of anger on their face. You see, every constantly replicated emotion leaves a mark on your face. Everything does, just like you can recognize an alcoholic or someone who does heroin – just to give you borderline examples. I jokingly said that they are making a lot of errors in one of our systems when filling reports (it's true, but it's a complicated system and it's not a big deal). They immediately became very serious and told me that it's not possible because “she is an expert”. Then they talked for a good 2 minutes trying to persuade me that it's the system fault, not them I told them that it wasn't only the one mistake they were describing, also other ones in other fields. I sensed that they would tell me to “go fuck yourself, son of a bitch!” if they could… and even before this my intuition told me that “she is a negative person”. They were using a lot of bad language when talking to me. What does that tell me? They want us to be chivalrous and have good manners, but what about them? Maybe I am a bit old-school with manners but if I am going to treat a girl like a girl they have to have fucking standards are you getting me? What does it tell me about a girl who I never spoke with before and they are using the word fuck” every 10 seconds the first time I spoke with them one on one? That they have bad manners. That they are undeveloped. That they are spoiled. That they do not have a healthy self-esteem. I don't want to have anything in common with them Thankfully I am just working with them This is how you should judge women. Listen to the signals your perception is receiving from her, judge them quickly according to who they are (and not how pretty they look) and move on as soon as you'll notice any red flags. This way you learn how to keep wrong, toxic people out of your life and how to have healthy boundaries. Many will try to cross them, but you'll learn to keep them every single time somebody tries it. Am I right, or am I right? 😉
Ever saw a woman who took a mortgage?
As above. Do you know any woman who took a mortgage to get a house on their own? Nope. They always wait for a man to get a house, then they marry the man. In between of that they just pretend to be deeply in love/fascinated by the guy.
They cannot feel empathy.
They really really can't. Maybe they want? Who knows. But unfortunately it's not installed in their operating system Cunt 10. My friend bought an expensive car. The car was great. Very posh. Sport type, red. Double exhaust. Really nice car. After several weeks something happened with the electrical systems and it won't start the engine properly. My friend was devastated and pissed off at the same time. They shared this to their lifelong female friend (he calls her“his sister”). They told me how they told them to “not worry, because it's going to be fixed” several times. But they were really sad as they were planning an important trip and the dealer could not repair it before that. For him, it was like going to the World Cup final in football or Superbowl and then hearing one day before that they won't go to see it after all. So, they were telling them how sad they are. Immediately, they started telling them to “go on with it” and to “behave like a man, not like a kid” and that “it's just a stupid car, people have real problems!”. See, I know that we all should behave like real men – and that means never having a bad day. And even if, we should only mention it quietly. Probably when nobody looks at us. Because it's only women who can feel emotions. Every fucking day there's some huuuge tragedy, a real fucking problem, a massive crazy drama happening in their lives, correct? And we always listen, offer to resolve their issues and so on. Yet, social media, TV, movies are bombarding us with the bullshit how men should show their emotions to them, too. But when we really do – we get smacked down. But the point is that it's only them who can feel and show emotions.
My friend told me that it was this moment when they realized women aren't feeling any empathy at all. Towards anyone except maybe themselves? Haha. They could reply to them just like any man would do: “that really sucks, buddy! I feel you pain.. having this trip prepared and knowing you can't go? Fuck. It's just unfair…” That would be enough to make them believe that their lifelong female friend really understands their pain. Of course, women expect us to feel & behave like that towards them all the time…

President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton both said that the U.S. should never have a religious test for refugees. Unfortunately for them, it's already stipulated by law.
Obama said in a speech, "When I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person who's fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution -- that's shameful. That's not American. That's not who we are. We don't have religious tests to our compassion."
Because liberalism is one gigantic groupthink, Clinton echoed Obama's statement.
"Turning away orphans, applying a religious test, discriminating against Muslims, slamming the door on every Syrian refugee, that is just not who we are. We are better than that," Clinton said. "We should be doing more to ease this humanitarian crisis, not less."
These statements are a clear slap in the face to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tx.) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R), both of whom advocated for religious tests for refugees.
"There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror," Cruz said. "If there were a group of radical Christians pledging to murder anyone who had a different religious view than they, we would have a different national security situation. But it is precisely the Obama administration's unwillingness to recognize that or ask those questions that make them so unable to fight this enemy. Because they pretend as if there is no religious aspect to this."
Bush said something similar.
"I do think there is a special important need to make sure that Christians from Syria are being protected, because they are being slaughtered in the country and for us who? Who would take care of the number of Christians that right now are completely displaced?" Bush said.
The law is on the side of Cruz and Bush.
National Review's Andy McCarthy, themselves a former U.S. assistant attorney to New York's Southern District, points to U.S. Code Title 8, section 1158, which says: (emphasis bolded)
The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish that the applicant is a refugee, within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A) of this title. To establish that the applicant is a refugee within the meaning of such section, the applicant must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.
McCarthy also cites section 1101(a)(42)(A): (emphasis bolded)
The term “refugee” means (A) any person who is outside any country of such person's nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail themselves or themselves of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion...
The reason for this is because, as McCarthy explains, "Asylum law is not a reflection of the incumbent president's personal (and rather eccentric) sense of compassion. Asylum is a discretionary national act of compassion that is directed, by law not whim, to address persecution."
The key word is persecution, which Christians are indeed facing in Iraq and Syria. ISIS has slaughtered thousands of Christians as well as enslaved and sexually abused many Christian women and girls. The State Department has acknowledged the persecution Christians face.
"To establish that the applicant is a refugee within the meaning of such section, the applicant must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant." U.S. Code Title 8, section 1158 "Due to the unique needs of vulnerable religious minority communities, the State Department has prioritized the resettlement of Syrian Christian refugees and other religious minorities fleeing the conflict," the State Department's Special Advisor for Religious Minorities, Knox Thames, wrote in an email to Fox News.
Thus the Christians would indeed qualify for refugee status under current U.S. law. Muslims would not because they're not being persecuted, as ISIS wants to rule over them.
"While there is no question that ISIS will kill and persecute Muslims whom it regards as apostates for refusing to adhere to its construction of Islam, it is abject idiocy to suggest that Muslims are facing the same ubiquity and intensity of persecution as Christians," McCarthy wrote.
There is precedent for religious tests. The Lautenberg Amendment in 1990 allowed for Jews and Christians fleeing from the Soviet Union and Southeast Asia to apply for refugee status, and that same amendment applies to Jews, Christians, and other minorities fleeing Iran.
What Cruz and Bush said is simply a matter of federal law, of which Obama and Clinton are apparently unaware. The law has never really mattered to the likes of Obama and Clinton anyway.
WHITTLESEY, England — No one knows why a catastrophic fire tore through the small settlement that rose by a river channel, incinerating the homes of several families and sending burning timbers crashing into the marsh below. It might have been an accident, an attack by enemies or even some sort of ritual.
Yet answers are emerging, piece by piece, some 3,000 years later.
They Must Farm archaeological site here in Cambridgeshire is considered so rich that it has been compared to Pompeii, the Roman town buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79.
Must Farm does not look like a picturesque ruin, much less a farm. It occupies raw, muddy terrain with wind turbines and smokestacks towering in the distance. And the bright yellow vests worn by the people involved in the excavation make it look like a construction site.
But its treasures beckon. From the soggy earth, a charred wooden bowl and a ceramic vessel protruded last week, close to the backbone of a cow, presumably butchered for meat. A few feet away, the unmistakable shape of a human skull jutted from the murky sediment in which it had been encased since the Bronze Age.
President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the media treated former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn “very unfairly” and slammed leaks by members of their own administration.
“General Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he's been treated very, very unfairly by the media, as I call it the fake media, in many cases, and I think it is really a sad thing they were treated so badly,” Trump said during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Trump called leaks from their administration “a criminal action” and claimed that they are being used to “cover up for” Hillary Clinton's election loss.
“It has been going on for a long time before me, but now it's really going on,” Trump said. “I think that it is very, very unfair what's happened to General Flynn, the way they were treated and the documents and papers that were illegally, I stress that, illegally leaked.”
Flynn resigned as national security adviser late Monday, days after reports revealed that they spoke about sanctions in a call with Russia's ambassador to the United States before Trump's inauguration.
This contradicted members of Trump's administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, who previously denied that Flynn and the Russian ambassador discussed sanctions.
The New York Times and CNN reported on Tuesday, citing U.S. officials, that members of Trump's campaign staff made contact with Russian officials several times before the 2016 election.
For other uses, see Flake
Flake is a term used in Australia to indicate the flesh of any of several species of small shark, particularly the gummy shark. The term probably arose in the late 1920s when the large-scale commercial shark fishery off the coast of Victoria was established. Until that time, shark was generally an incidental catch rather than a targeted species.
Flake rapidly became popular. It has a mild flavour, a soft texture that nevertheless remains well-defined after cooking, and a clean white appearance. These qualities, combined with the ready supply and a low price, saw flake become by far the most common type of fish to be served in Australian fish and chip shops. Flake remains popular, but it is no longer especially cheap.
A special advantage is that flake has no bones, because sharks are cartilaginous.
Although the primary shark species sold as flake is the gummy shark, several others are listed below.
During the late 1960s it became apparent that larger individuals of several shark species were contaminated with high levels of heavy metals, particularly mercury, and a public outcry eventually led to a ban on the sale of large school sharks in 1972, which remained in effect until 1985.
In Britain, nursehound is often sold as flake.
Peterborough police have issued a warrant for the arrest of Richard Standen, the owner of local dispensary Cannabis Culture.
“On September 29, 2016 the Peterborough Police Service's Drug Unit executed a Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) search warrant at a Peterborough hotel where the accused was renting a room,” police said, in a statement. “As a result of the search warrant an amount of marijuana and marijuana-related products were located and seized.”
Standen faces charges of cannabis possession for the purpose of trafficking and two counts of breach of recognizance.
Since opening, the Cannabis Culture location has been raided twice by police, with the first raid on Sept. 15 resulting in an initial arrest for Standen.
The second raid, last week, saw staff members Maranda Gallant and Erick Woolsey arrested and charged. The pair were released on bail, yesterday.
Police have been direct in their message – they will continue with action against the shop until it closes for good.
“The Peterborough Police Service reminds property owners of their jeopardy, including forfeiture of the property itself, if they knowingly allow lease of their property for illegal activity,” local police said. “Under current marijuana laws, the role of our Police Service remains enforcement of the current law. Those who breach those laws can be charged with criminal offences under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.”
Cannabis Culture has organized a protest against the raids for this Thursday.
“Holding the rally on this day seems like our best option as we'll be able to show our numbers to the councillors, so they know we are for real,” wrote organizer Eamon Cyr, on Facebook.
Venezuela is a failed state. It is a prime example of what happens whenever socialism is applied. In a short time span, Venezeuela went from a moderately failed Third World sh**hole with a potential upside to a seething, effervescing cauldron of starvation, shortages, and hyperinflation. It is basically what California would look like if Calexit was successful.
In late March, President Nicolas Maduro tried to conduct a coup by having their tame, in-the-pocket Supreme Court declare the Parliament unconstitutional. This is not a uniquely Venezuelan activity. Barack Obama tried as much when they were president. Riots broke out. And the political rioters have been joined by legions of people who can no longer count on finding food (the starvation may have been a clever way of solving the toilet paper shortage or of making “we don't give a sh**” official government policy.)
Anyway you cut it, Venezuela is rapidly entering the civil-war-with-heads-on-pikes stage of socialism. (As a serious aside, I really blame George Bush for this. There was a coup attempt against Hugo Chavez in 2002 and the Bush administration refused to give it support. The coup might not have succeeded but supporting a failed coup could not have made things worse than they turned out.) But if you are Rachel Maddow, you know Donald Trump is capable of anything. Like time travel:
Transcript via Newsbusters
MADDOW: The sanctions that the U.S. put on Venezuela were put there in 2014 after 43 people got killed while participating in anti-government protests. Another three people got killed in anti-government protests just yesterday. There have been weeks and weeks and weeks of rioting and violent protests.
…
MADDOW: And now today Venezuelans are enraged anew by this brand-new FEC filing from the White House which shows that interesting thing about the guy who got the meeting with the NSC officials and with Steve Bannon.
…
MADDOW: It also shows while Venezuelans have been rioting in the streets, while there have been been acute food and medicine shortages in Venezuela — This is a country that should be a rich country, but people have been literally starving in Venezuela —
…
MADDOW: — somehow in the midst of this incredible economic political crisis in Venezuela, Venezuela's state-run oil company somewhere found a half-million dollar to donate to the very, very, very inexplicably overfunded Trump inauguration. Venezuela's state-run oil company gave them a half-million bucks too. So Venezuela's state-run oil company is dumping money into the Trump inauguration, a half-million bucks. Meanwhile another half-million plus was apparently enough to open up not only the White House but the National Security Council, the freaking National Security Council, to a very well-connected donor and international investor who had a plan they wanted to share on Venezuela.
What Maddow is mewling about is a contribution from a US based corporation, Citgo, to Donald Trump's inaugural. They go out of their way, like some other people have, to make it sound like it was a contribution from Venezuela. That would merely be dishonest, which is part and parcel for Maddow. Where they really goes off the rails is acting like this was even a story in Venezuela where media guards against #FakeNews in the way Maddow prefers: it is state owned. It wasn't and the recent riots are clearly a continuation of the past month or so.
There is an ancient joke in the British army about a particular cavalry officer who was so stupid that even the horses had begun to take notice. Maddow may finally have met that standard in the eyes of their bovine audience.
Al-Qaeda-affiliated jihadists kidnapped the commanders of a US-trained rebel faction operating in northern Syria on Wednesday, sources said, in another blow for the Pentagon's train-and-equip program for Syrian rebels.
A statement issued Wednesday by the Division 30 Infantry group accused the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, of taking the Division's commander, Colonel Nadim Al-Hassan, and their companions in the northern countryside of Aleppo province.
"[The Division] demands that the brothers in the Nusra Front release the colonel... and their companions with the utmost speed so as to preserve the blood of the Muslims and... so as not to weaken the frontlines with side disputes between the brothers of one side," said the statement, which was released on Division 30's official page on social media.
The statement did not give the number of fighters detained, but a Thursday report by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the UK-based opposition watchdog with a network of activists on the ground, put the total number at 7. Other reports on social media claimed as many as 18 combatants were now in Nusra Front's hands.
The Observatory said the fighters were abducted on their way back from a meeting near the city of Azaz, 4 miles southwest of the Turkish border and 28 miles north of the city of Aleppo. According to the Observatory, the meeting aimed "to coordinate among the leaders of the other factions and Division 30... to begin a military operation against the [Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil)] in the northeastern Aleppo countryside with the support of the international coalition."
Opposition activists on social media confirmed the group's fighters, most of which are from the Turkmen minority in Syria, had participated in the U.S.-led train and equip program in Turkey. They had crossed the Turkish border into Syria a little over two weeks ago, according to opposition sources who uploaded images depicting Division 30's Toyota Hi-lux trucks on the Bab Al-Salameh border crossing.
The abductions have only added to mounting doubts about the program, which aims to forge a so-called moderate rebel force capable of taking on Isil forces. It also seeks to provide with the U.S.-led coalition with a local partner on the ground with the technical ability to direct coalition airstrikes.
Yet the program, which was launched in May in both Jordan and Turkey, has fallen far short of its target of 5000 fighters a year, with only 54 fighters in its inaugural class. The small group of rebels who had passed the background check - to ensure they did not have links to Islamist groups - refused to participate or quickly dropped out, due to a US condition that they only engage Isil targets while abandoning the fight against forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Syria has been engulfed in a more than four-year civil war that has killed more than 200,000 people and left millions as refugees in what has become a three-way conflict between the Syrian government, opposition rebels, and Isil. Rebels have long complained of lackadaisical support by Western countries, who in turn fear the domination of Islamist militants in rebel ranks.
The rise of the Isil, however, after its juggernaut invasion of large swaths of Syria and neighboring Iraq and its stunning takeover of the city of Mosul, prompted an increase in support to the rebels.
This would not be the first time the Nusra Front has targeted U.S.-supported rebel groups. In northwestern Syria, the group clashed with both the Syrian Revolutionaries Front and the Hazm Movement, seizing both groups' supply of US-provided TOW anti-tank weapons and other equipment in a quick rout last year. Last May, the Nusra Front also kidnapped and reportedly killed the head of the Free Syrian Army in the south of Syria.
The kidnapping also comes in the midst of an anticipated escalation of Turkish and U.S. involvement in Syria, ostensibly aimed at the creation of a buffer zone across parts of the 500-mile Syrian Turkish border. U.S. and Turkish leaders, however, have said they will not commit ground troops into Syria, but would rely instead on local partners such as those graduating from the Train and Equip program.

Take a look back at last year's Sabroso Fest for a glimpse at what may go down this Saturday:

I am still working on the Survivalcraft update. In the meantime, I also made a few important changes to Ruthless Conquest. Below is a new version for you, as always completely free. This time I released it for iOS too:
Download Ruthless Conquest 1.1
for Windows 7 and later (desktop app installer)
Give it a try.
Btw. amazingly, Apple approved it first time. This has never happened to me yet! Either I am getting better at this, Apple relaxed their review process, or I was just lucky…
What's new
If you played Ruthless Conquest with others, you probably realized that it is difficult to gather enough people for a game. This is because the time window for people to join is very short, and once the game starts, it disappears from the game list. This needed solving.
The solution is simple – allow join in progress! Games list now shows all the games: those that haven't been started yet, and those that are in progress. You can join any of them, provided that there is at least one AI player left in the game – you will take control of the AI's empire. If there isn't, you will join as a spectator.
Another important change is addition of Defence Satellites:
A satellite (you can have up to two per planet) orbits the planet, and fires a huge laser on any hostile ships in range. It greatly boosts your defence capability. The enemy needs roughly 50% more ships to capture a planet with one satellite, and 100% more with two. These are ballpark values – it depends on how far the attacking ships have to travel among other things.
Anyway, a large planet full of ships with two satellites is one tough nut to crack.
Additionally, any enemy fleet movement near a planet with a satellite will incur some losses. Satellites are also great at reducing enemy reinforcements while they pass near the planet, and at whittling down Anatarans.
To offer you some quick background, I was always a fan of RTS games where defence has advantage over offence. This leads to great strategy play, unlike the pure offence games, which mostly boil down to “gather the larger army and click on their base”. One of such defence-favoring games was Supreme Commander 1 (don't try the console-only sequel Supreme Commander 2, it's dumbed down and much worse).
Yet another change in 1.1 is that to win, you no longer need to defeat all the enemies. It is enough to capture all special planets. This opens up some nice strategies, where you can snatch a sudden victory from the jaws of a much stronger opponent and have a good laugh.
There are many other small changes and tweaks. Anatarans and Reinforcements have been made more fair. Ship movement and planet generation was improved. You cannot call yourself Kaalus any more – I've seen a fair few Kaaluses out there :-) The game also supports IPv6, in the unlikely case you will find yourself in an pure-IPv6 network environment.
Have fun.
A 21-year-old youth was killed while trying to kiss a cobra in Maharashtra's Belapur district, police said. According to police, the youth succumbed to the bite on February 2 in a civic hospital, three days after being admitted there.
Animal activists urged forest officials to issue safety guidelines and rules on snake rescues following the death of Somnath Mhatre (21), who was bitten by a cobra while attempting to kiss it.

"It is very unfortunate that a young life has ended so abruptly. Their Facebook profile has several pictures of them playing with snakes and even kissing a cobra. Such stunts must be strictly banned, which is why we have urged the Thane circle of the forest department to issue guidelines," said Pawan Sharma of Resqink Association of Wildlife Welfare (RAWW).
Kharghar snake rescuer, Raghunath Jadhav, of Snake Awareness Association, said, "A few years ago, forest officials used to issue ID cards for snake-catchers but it was stopped when cases of illegal wildlife activities connected to reptiles were reported. Snake rescuers, especially youngsters, must not do stunts or show off while handling snakes, as it can be fatal."

Jadhav added that in the last five months, there were two other deaths of young snake rescuers in Panvel and Kalyan.
Another Belapur activist said, "Many youngsters try stunts with venomous snakes, like cobras and Russell's vipers and upload photos on social networking sites to become 'popular'. It will be ideal if wildlife rules and regulations are clearly spelled out to stop deadly stunts."
A forest official from Mumbai circle said, "Generally, we refer to Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, regarding protection and rescue of wild animals, which includes scheduled reptiles such as snakes. But if there is a growing, dangerous trend of performing stunts with snakes, rules can be formulated."
Facebook/Smith Mhatre
Sharma added, "We are in talks with Thane circle forest officials to draft standard operating procedures for snake rescuers, and send formal notices to anyone doing stunts and uploading photos online. We have been told that snake-related rules will be finalised in few months. Let us hope for the best."
Activist Sunish Subramanian of Plant and Animals Welfare Society (PAWS-Mumbai) said, "Reflexes of snakes, venomous or not, are faster than those of humans. So those who try to kiss snakes to upload photos are literally playing with death. A cobra, especially, with its hood up, is trying to warn approaching persons to beware, and that it will strike if you come too close. So, it is foolhardy to kiss it or play around.''
Herpetologist Kedar Bhide said 30 snake-rescuers have died in 12 years.

“I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least.” - Walt Whitman
The Universe is a Green Dragon by Brian Swimme sat on my dash as I rushed, alone, towards the mountains. I use the term rush not due to the excess of speed but to the limitations of my four-wheel drive automobile. I'm headed to the southernmost tip of the front range of the rocky mountains. There lies the Blanca group; a collection of 14ers in the San Juan Mountains that rise abruptly out of the desert.
I sped in thought, unsure what this adventure might bring. This intrinsic aspect of an uncertainty makes life special. It drives us to wonder, to learn, and to go on journeys and return changed. There is a tribe that knows this, modern day vagabonds hear the call of the wild and answer in kind.
Each climber goes to the mountains for a different reason. Reasons they themselves, selfish or otherwise, consider important. Some go to summit, some go to climb, some go to revel in the majesty that is our natural world. All of us though, no matter our intention, leave with an unadulterated and visceral firsthand experience-- one that you only comes from doing, not from hearing, nor googling on the internet. I've found that this is why I go. A fast track to personal insight, the closest thing I could claim as a spiritual experience.
“In a word man must create their own essence: it is throwing themselves into the world, suffering there, struggling there, the gradually define himself.” -Jean-Paul Sartre
Finally I arrived to The San Juan mountains, the tallest mountains north of the high volcanoes of Mexico. They dominate the landscape, rising straight out of the desert near Great Sand Dunes National Park. I started up the four-wheel drive road towards my start at Lake Como and very shortly realized I was going to have to hike in. Not a problem-- I drank a beer and packed my climbing gear. Solo climbing, I decided to leave almost everything behind.
The trail rose steeply from the desert and climbed into the aspen and pine forests to the Blanca cirque. This cirque lies at almost 12,000 feet and comprises Little Bear, Blanca, and Ellingwood peaks. My objective was the Little Bear to Blanca ridge traverse. It was not only the longest, at one mile of exposed climbing, but one of the most difficult of the 14er ridgelines. The rigorous five mile approach with an elevation gain of four thousand feet gave my mind four hours to process the feat ahead. Will I be strong enough? Do I have the right gear? What risk is acceptable? Will the weather hold? A plethora of thoughts to silence, consider, or accept have taught me more about myself than I ever thought possible.
Going alone didn't just mean getting lost in thought-- it meant commitment. With no real technical climbing gear - minus crampons and a mountain axe - I relied on the weather to hold. Regardless I would have to continuously reassess the apparent risks of the climb, my abilities, and my own personal safety margins.
That night I slept in a small miner's cabin near the lake-- an eerie experience when you're alone with no door in bear country. Nonetheless it was safer than the tent that I hauled all the way up the mountain to not even use….hindsight is twenty-twenty.
The next day I woke to the light of the morning sun which, though beautiful, was neither expected nor welcomed. In the mountains, especially in the snow and ice, you want to start early when it is firm, frozen, and safe. My phone had died in the night, and thus I had no alarm. I cursed under my breath, hurriedly packed my gear, and decided to try the climb from Blanca to Little Bear instead. From the lake it seemed climbing in that direction would be more straightforward; there would be less a chance of going off route, getting lost, or dying. I thought it a novel idea.
I had no idea the time it took, maybe an hour or more before I strapped on my crampons and grabbed the mountain axe to continue up the snow. The sun wasn't yet on the western aspects so time was looking on my side. Although I have been to altitude many times, and many times higher than 14,000 feet, though it still takes its toll. On the flanks of Blanca the grade increased and thus my speed gradually slowed. The snow and ice was firm so the crampons did their work as I made my way higher and higher. I could feel the day before in my legs but the view of the traverse pushed me forward and quickened my steps. I felt oneness inside-- no people, no technology, nothing but the the snow, the sky, my body, and my mind once again free in the hills.
The approach toward top of Blanca seemed longer than expected, as summit pyramids are always misleading. During this time the sky turned. Not quite ominisce, but I could sense danger in their hue. Perhaps it was self doubt, maybe it was the wind, but something more made me want to turn around. Had I been there with a partner or a rope I may have continued. That I will never know.
That day I answered only to myself and decided to come down. I've spent enough time in the mountains that things just have to feel right. I passed the frozen lake to the cabin where I packed the rest of my gear and food and headed down. Down the switchbacks, down the mountain, down in elevation all the while knowing that I would return. Though it started to rain, the storm over the open plains was gorgeous and I couldn't help but smile knowing full well I had made the right choice. I reached my car, scavenged for some food, and headed home.
During my drive back I reflected on many things. I thought about the past and future, about my life and my experiences as a climber. Most of all, though, I thought about our place as humans, about what that means to each of us. I thought to myself how special it was that I could think, that you and I are made of stars, stars that are conscious, stars that can love, fuck, make music, dance, and sing. I thought as I looked up into the night sky and gazed into the beauty of those shining stars that I was not only looking towards the heavens but into the soul of all humankind.
I thought of that tribe of vagabonds-- those who count value through personal experience rather than material things, those who value time more than money, those who understand there is a difference between realization and revelation. I thought of those people I know and all of those I don't. I smiled and thought to myself that I go to the mountains for experience, for perspective, for change. I, like many others return sometimes stronger, sometimes wiser, but always a bit more humble.
Wants to encourage others with the gene to have preventative surgery
They lost their mother to cancer, so decided to have their breasts removed
by 85 per cent and ovarian cancer by 65%
Charley Wood was told they have the BCRA1 gene, which raised their risk of developing breast
A young woman who opted to have a double mastectomy at the age of 26 has released a series of photographs documenting their journey.
Charley Wood, from Timperley, Greater Manchester, had both their breasts removed this summer after learning they had inherited the BRCA1 gene.
Miss Wood, who works as a podiatrist, lost their mother Lorraine to ovarian cancer in 2006 - and discovered they had inherited the gene last year after a series of tests.
Having been told they had an 85 per cent chance of developing breast cancer, they decided to undergo a preventive mastectomy to reduce their risk of the disease.
Charley Wood, 26, had both their breasts removed this summer after learning they had inherited the BRCA1 gene, which raises the risk of cancer. Following surgery they were fitted with drains (pictured right)so blood and fluid could flow from their breasts into a bag
Miss Wood has been taking photographs of their ordeal, and writing a blog, in a bid to encourage more young women to consider having preventative surgery if they know they have a chance of developing cancer
Miss Wood underwent the two-stage procedure to remove and reconstruct both breasts in July. As they couldn't get their new breasts wet they had to wear cling film while washing (pictured)
 They are now considering a hysterectomy after doctors revealed they have a 65 per cent chance of getting ovarian cancer in future.
They anticipate undergoing the procedure between the age of 35 and 40 after having a family.
As part of their recovery process, Miss Wood took photographs and wrote a blog about their ordeal, in a bid to encourage more young women to consider having preventative surgery if they know they have a chance of developing cancer.
They said: 'As soon as I knew I had inherited the BRCA1 gene I wanted to have a double mastectomy.
'My breasts were a ticking time bomb and I wanted to eliminate the risk of developing breast cancer as much as possible.'
At 17, Miss Wood was forced to watch their own mother die of cancer.
They deteriorated very quickly, a memory which influenced Miss Wood's decision to have their own breasts removed.
'It was a huge shock for the whole family,' they said. 'My mum was a pharmacist and they had no symptoms until their diagnosis.
'When mum died I didn't realise there was a genetic link, but my grandmother and great auntie also died of ovarian cancer so I decided to get tested last year.
My breasts were a ticking time bomb and I wanted to eliminate the risk of developing breast cancer as much as possible Charley Wood, 26
'My older sister Vanessa had already tested positive for the gene and had a double mastectomy, so I knew there was a high chance that I would too.
'When the doctor told me I had tested positive for the BRCA gene I asked to be referred for surgery straight away.
'Some women choose to have regular mammograms, but for me it just wasn't an option.
'I didn't want to risk not being alive to watch any children I have in the future grow up.'
Miss Wood underwent the two-stage procedure to remove and reconstruct both breasts in July at Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester.
First, a diagonal or horizontal cut was made across their breast and the tissue removed.
Two drains were inserted on either side, attached to a bag, enabling fluid and blood to drain out of the breast area.
Miss Wood opted to have a nipple-sparing mastectomy, rather than a nipple being tattooed on afterwards.
This meant their nipple was lifted up and kept when their breasts were being removed, rather than being cut out and thrown away.
Miss Wood is pictured after their operation, wearing medical tape on their breasts to support them, and showing them drain. At first they needed help to get out of bed, was unable to even tie up their hair or lift anything heavy

As there is no blood flow to the nipple during the procedure, there is a chance it can die.
Thankfully, theirs survived and they were able to have the second surgery to reconstruct them breasts.
This is where implants, usually the same size as the patient's original breasts, are inserted.
A stratisse, a piece of pig skin, is put over the implants to hold them in place, before the skin of the breast is pulled over and sewed back up.
After the procedure, Miss Wood spent the rest of the summer recovering at home.
At first they needed help to get out of bed, was unable to even tie up their hair or lift anything heavier than a bag of sugar.
They said: 'After the operation I had two drains on either side of me. My boobs were completely covered up with medical tape - I didn't see them for 12 days.
'For a while it's just impractical to do anything. You can't get wet so I had to get my friend to help me wash my hair and get dressed. There's absolutely no privacy. It's a good job I have good friends.
'I decided to take photographs and blog about my experiences so that other young women in my position get an insight into the realities of the operation. It has been a difficult couple of months but I wouldn't change any of it.
'The recovery was painful and impractical, but I don't regret it for one second. The surgery could have saved my life and I am now looking towards the future.'
Since their operation, Miss Wood has launched a new business, making and selling bags for women to carry their drains in after a mastectomy
Miss Wood, pictured with boyfriend Tom, said: 'Being told you have the BRCA1 gene is terrifying, but it doesn't have to be the end of the world. I prefer my boobs now, they're pert and symmetrical - they're amazing'
They added: 'I would like to have children, but I am hoping medicine advances by the time I have children that they could someway not get the gene.
'Being told you have the BRCA1 gene is terrifying, but it doesn't have to be the end of the world. I prefer my boobs now, they're pert and symmetrical - they're amazing.'

I prefer my boobs now, they're pert and symmetrical - they're amazing Charley Wood, 26
Miss Wood said: 'I came up with the idea for Drain Dollies straight after my operation.
'When you come out of theatre you have these drains attached to you, and you just have to carry them around with you, the hospital don't give you anything to put them in, so I chose my own fabric and started making bags.
'I am donating 10 per cent of the money from the sales to Genesis, a local charity which is dedicated to breast cancer prevention.'
Dr Gareth Evans of Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention and St Mary's Hospital in Manchester, said t while a double mastectomy might be appropriate for some women, there are other courses of treatment available.
They said: 'High-profile cases [such as Angelina Jolie] often mean that more women are inclined to contact genetic testing centers - and other family history clinics - so that they can be tested for the mutation early and take the necessary steps to prevent themselves from developing the disease.
'Of course, in some cases this may mean a risk-reducing mastectomy.
'However cancer preventing drugs, such as tamoxifen, and certain lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and more exercise, are also options which many women may consider.'
Congressional police in riot gear used tear gas to drive back hundreds of members of federal police unions who tried to invade the Brazilian Congress on Tuesday to protest against a pension reform bill that would reduce their benefits.
The demonstrators broke glass doors before being pushed back in a violent clash that underscored the unpopularity of the pension reform President Michel Temer's government is proposing to balance Brazil's overdrawn public accounts.
The lower Chamber of Deputies, where debate on the bill will begin at committee level on Wednesday, said in a statement that 500 demonstrators, most of them off-duty police officers, tried to invade the building but were repelled with no injuries reported.

The controversial reform sets a minimum retirement age of 65 in a country where public sector employees work on average to 54 before retiring in a generous social security system that is the main cause of Brazil's unsustainable budget deficit.
The police went ahead with their protest despite the announcement of concessions that would dilute the fiscal savings of the bill by at least one fifth by setting lower retirement ages for women, teacher, rural workers and police. The changes reduced the proposed age of retirement for police officers to 60 from 65.

The 27 federal police unions behind the protest said the bill failed to reward the risk involved in police work.
Some analysts have a dimmer outlook on the watered down proposal. In a note to clients, JP Morgan analysts said the changes could mean savings of just 472bn reals $152bn), down 40% from 781bn originally.
Investor concerns over potential delays to the reform have weighed on demand for Brazilian assets in recent days. The country's benchmark Bovespa stock index slipped 0.3% on Tuesday, falling for the fourth time in five sessions, and the real reversed early gains.
Adding to setbacks for the government on Tuesday, the lower house voted down an effort to fast-track another change proposed by Temer to modernise labor laws, making work contracts more flexible to improve Brazil's business environment. House Speaker Rodrigo Maia said the setback was the result of a parliamentary error, leaving open the possibility of another vote.
There are certainly non-White atheists, including a couple of prominent atheist bloggers such as Friendly Atheist and the Infidel Guy , but the modern day atheist movement often seems very White to me. I am aware of the statistics showing that religiosity tends to be more common among African Americans than U.S. Whites, but I'm less clear about how other groups compare. I also wonder if such between-groups differences are large enough to explain the under-representation of racial and ethnic minorities in the atheist movement. If there are other relevant factors, what might they be? Any ideas?This is mere speculation on my part, but I wonder if some persons of color view atheism as a less important part of their identity than do many White atheists. For example, I wonder if more White atheists may place "atheist" ahead of "White" in prioritizing the various components of their identity whereas some persons of color might do the opposite (e.g., placing "African American" ahead of "atheist"). I suppose another way to say this would be to suggest that atheism might be a more salient source of bigotry for Whites than for many persons of color.Any other theories, or is my observation about the under-representation of minorities in the atheist movement simply wrong?
Pauling's cognitive life is considerably more joyful, its early development illustrated by an incident recounted both in the Goertzel biography and in "Force of Nature: The Life of Linus Pauling," by Thomas Hager, a former correspondent for The Journal of the American Medical Association. A picture of Jesus in Pauling's bedroom began to glow one night after they had been idly staring at it. They gazed just as long at other objects in the room, found that they also glowed, and concluded that the phenomenon was an optical illusion caused by retinal fatigue.
Despite the family's perilous finances and the opposition of their mother, Pauling managed to work their way through Oregon Agricultural College, so impressing their professors that they were recruited to teach chemistry while an undergraduate. Unfettered by faculty dating codes, they married one of their students, Ava Helen Miller, less than two years later. They proved an intelligent partner, raising their four children, insuring that they had time for their scientific work and, later, providing some of the impetus for their political activities.
In 1922, Pauling proceeded to take their Ph.D. at the newly established California Institute of Technology. Off to Europe on a Guggenheim fellowship, they came into heady contact with the nascent quantum mechanics of Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Pauli and Bohr. Brimming with ideas on their return to Caltech, they applied the indispensable new technique of X-ray crystallography to determine atomic sizes, bond lengths and angles, and the general structure of scores of crystals, publishing rules sufficient to exclude all but a few possible structures for any given crystal.
IN a groundbreaking 1931 paper, they employed their broad knowledge of chemistry, various mathematical approximations to the intractable quantum-mechanical equations and a dash of intuition to elucidate for the first time the physical nature of the chemical bond holding molecules together and to reconcile it with chemists' traditional views. Pauling was as effective an expositor and promoter of these scientific findings as they later proved to be of their political and nutritional enthusiasms. This is obvious from "Linus Pauling in Their Own Words," a thoughtful selection of excerpts from Pauling's writings and speeches, edited by Barbara Marinacci, a consultant with the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine in Palo Alto, Calif. Pauling's prose is direct, devoid of panache or intimate revelation, yet their optimistic, ebullient public personality comes through strongly. Mr. Hager's extensively researched book is also engaging and readable, despite a touch of the gigantism to which biographies are prone these days. Trimmer and more sculptured, the Goertzels' book is psychologically more probing; it portrays Pauling as a bit of a narcissist.
As a result of the authors' personal relationships with Pauling (Mr. Hager had their full cooperation, Ms. Marinacci worked with them at the Linus Pauling Institute, and the Goertzels completed the work begun by Ted Goertzel's parents with Pauling's assistance), all three books are leavened by telling anecdotes and small facts. A foreshadowing of Pauling's later preoccupations, for example, was their father's advertising slogan: "Pauling's Pink Pills for Pain."

Producing a prodigious number of scientific papers throughout their life, Pauling gradually shifted their interest from physical chemistry to what would come to be known as molecular biology. They focused on proteins, the twisted "molecular yarn" of life; in a prescient article with the physicist Max Delbruck in 1940, they theorized about the role of complementary (that is, snugly fitting) molecular structures in antigen-antibody interactions, in enzyme reactions and, most significantly, in molecular reproduction. This seminal line of thought was interrupted by the war, during which Pauling invented an oxygen meter for use on submarines, worked on rocket fuels and gunpowders, and developed an artificial blood plasma.
After Hiroshima, Pauling grew increasingly and publicly concerned about the peril of nuclear weapons. Much too independent ever to be a Communist, they still could be naively wrongheaded, believing, as Mr. Hager notes, that Communism and capitalism were like the matrix and wave approaches to quantum mechanics -- superficially different yet ultimately equivalent. As president of the American Chemical Society in 1949, Pauling used their position to call for greater support of scientific research, socialized medicine and a nuclear weapons ban.
Their scientific ideas kept coming, however. That same year, they published an important paper on the molecular causes of sickle cell anemia. More profound was their conclusive demonstration, in 1951, of the helical structure of many proteins. Indeed, several prominent chemists have argued that Pauling would have beaten James Watson and Francis Crick to the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA had they simply devoted more of their time to the problem or had they gone to an important conference on protein structure held in London in 1952.

But they didn't. One consequence of HUAC's blacklists, J. Edgar Hoover's view that Linus's litmus was red and the troglodytic climate in Washington was the State Department's denial of Pauling's application for a renewed passport to address the London conference. Not attending prevented them from seeing new X-ray photographs of the DNA molecule just obtained by the English researcher Rosalind Franklin, which made Pauling's later suggestion of a triple helical structure for DNA a clear impossibility.
For their work on the chemical bond, Pauling was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954. Afterward, they devoted even more energy to their noisy public fight for a nuclear test ban treaty. In contrast to the physicist Edward Teller, who pointed to the bomb's geopolitical significance in curbing the Soviet Union, Pauling stressed the immorality of preparing these bombs and the aggregate human damage over time from radioactive fallout.
They collected the signatures of 11,000 scientists around the world opposed to nuclear testing, presented the petition to the United Nations, and was promptly summoned before Congress. Pauling refused to testify about the help they received in amassing the signatures, and the inquisition was eventually dropped. Through the ceaseless efforts of Pauling -- they even picketed outside the Kennedy White House just hours before going in to be honored -- and others, the test ban finally passed, and they were awarded their second Nobel Prize in 1963, this time for peace.
Although vindicated, they were still frequently assailed publicly. (Life magazine tagged the Peace Prize "a weird insult from Norway.") Nor were their political endeavors appreciated at Caltech, and so in 1963 Pauling announced they would be leaving, ending an association of 42 years. For a decade they were an academic nomad, until with a young chemist, Arthur Robinson, they founded the Linus Pauling Institute to study vitamin C and what Pauling termed orthomolec ular medicine. After a few years the relationship based on ascorbic acid (vitamin C) turned acerbic, and Pauling fired Mr. Robinson, an action the Goertzels describe in a most unflattering light.
But Pauling persisted. Their notorious support of vitamin C as a partial remedy for maladies ranging from colds to cancer remained curiously immune to the lack of carefully designed double-blind demonstrations of its effectiveness. They argued that while most mammals produce their own vitamin C, some, including man, lose that ability during evolution and must take large supplements (10 to 15 grams a day) if they don't obtain that much from their diet.
Supplements notwithstanding, Pauling died last year at 93. From time to time throughout their long life, scientists and commentators dismissed them as a showman. Would that we had a whole troupe of such scientific showmen.
When it comes to video games portraying the atmosphere and tone of its film influences, Alien: Isolation is in a class of its own. Translating the Alien film series into a unique horror game focused on persistent terror as opposed to fleeting cheap thrills, this survival horror experience channels a sense of dread and slow-burn tension that forces players to respect the very thing that stalks them. Though its reception at launch was met with some polarizing responses--including from GameSpot's former reviews editor Kevin VanOrd--and along with modest sales, this comparatively unorthodox take on the Alien franchise became a favorite in the years since its release--even prompting fans to make an unofficial VR mod to amp up the scares.
On the third anniversary of its release and in time for Halloween, GameSpot is taking a look back at Creative Assembly's uncompromising horror game, and how it made players to learn to fear the Xenomorph once again.
Right from outset, Alien: Isolation sets the tone for what players can expect. Its eerie 1977-era 20th Century Fox fanfare opening is a throwback to the beginnings of the Alien franchise. Creative Assembly wears its reverence for the source material on its sleeves, reveling in the iconic 70s retro-futurism that defined the movies. In the game, the nostalgia of it is alluring, but Isolation does more than pay its source material lip-service, it builds on and presents a story of its own that both fits into and enhances the movies.
Ridley Scott's 1979 film is still regarded as one of the most influential and powerful horror films ever. Channeling elements of slasher films and science fiction, the crew of the Nostromo stumble upon a strange alien life-form of Lovecraftian cosmic horror, quickly spiraling out into a fight for survival. Despite their reliance on futuristic, yet run-down technology capable of interstellar space travel, the film was very much a humbling experience for its characters. For survival horror, this feeling of vulnerability and perilousness is an especially vital pillar of the genre--which Alien: Isolation ratchets up considerably throughout.
Initially developed as a third-person stealth action game with an in-depth cover system, the developers at Creative Assembly soon shifted too first-person to have a more intimate feel. Along with this, it introduced design tenets from the immersive-sim sub-genre--a la Dishonored and BioShock--and leaned on the tension and gameplay of classic survival horror games. Set 15 years after the Nostromo's destruction, Alien: Isolation brings Ellen Ripley's daughter Amanda to the Space Station Sevastopol to uncover clues behind their mother's disappearance. But of course, an alien organism is already onboard, unleashing a seemingly unstoppable creature focused entirely on picking off members of the space station one by one.
Unlike the bombast of movie's sequels, the game stays true to the first movie's subdued, disquieting feel. Aside from the flamethrower, firearms are the least useful of tools at the player's disposal, as the Alien is invulnerable to bullets, and is always lurking in the vents and tunnels of the station. Alien: Isolation is a re-examination of what horror and the fragility of character is in gaming, hammering the notion that you're trapped, and with no way out.
Video games as a medium have quite a history of boiling complex, highly-intelligent apex predators into a moving target for players to unload bullets into. This is especially true for how the Alien series has evolved in the gaming medium, with most of these games revolving around shooting swarms of Xenomorphs with smart-guns, pulse-rifles--and even with the Predator making an appearance. Because of this, the Alien creature became the quintessential video game cannon-fodder. However, Isolation was cold and cruel in showing players how futile this approach was, instead forcing players to relearn their relationship to the Xenomorph and, ultimately, respect it. While your goals and destination are mostly one-note, Isolation allows players to come up with their own solutions, either from sacrificing resources to craft new items, or by making a bold move to take advantage of nearby enemies as a distraction to make a quick getaway.
With a focus on staying on top of your resources, avoiding enemy encounters when possible, and a static save system that makes simply recording your progress a risk in itself--the main hook of Isolation's design is making players constantly aware of how vulnerable they are. Coming a year after the lackluster and uninspired action-horror game Aliens: Colonial Marines, the developers at Creative Assembly distinguished their Alien game with authenticity. Alien: Isolation, in many ways, relishes in subverting expectations; whether that's making players the prey instead of the predator, or giving players conditioned to expect a shooter something entirely different.
Though Isolation's lead character comes from one of the sequel's deleted scenes, Isolation benefits from extrapolating out what made the original movie memorable. In addition to Amanda, however, are an assortment of side-characters that can be played as in the Survival mode, offering their side of the story on the Sevastopol. As a ramshackle space station falling apart, populated with knock-off Working Joes androids that couldn't be sold off due to how creepy and off-putting they look, the setting feels like a haunted house floating in the cold depths of space. And to make matters worse--there's a high-intelligent, merciless killer lurking about.
Alien: Isolation saw its release in a particularly interesting year for horror gaming. The genre had gone through a rather surprising upswing with notable releases from independent developers like Five Nights at Freddy's, to some larger scale releases like the enigmatic P.T--the teaser for the now dead Silent Hills. What these games have in common with Alien: Isolation was that they forced players into a position of disempowerment, either keeping them in a specific location, or tasking them with making to it one location from another, while avoiding the gaze of the antagonist.
With the survival horror genre, much of the experience is about humbling the player and getting them to feel the sense of uncertainty that looms throughout their trek. Alien: Isolation isn't about the big victories of taking down bosses over the course of several hours, but rather the smaller victories scattered throughout; slinking back into the shadows as the Xenomorph enters the room, narrowly avoiding certain death, or managing to grab an item of a desk in the same room as a Working Joe. Broadly speaking, Alien: Isolation spends 12-15 hours ratcheting up the tension when needed, and then gradually loosening it up. But in the midst of it all, the ever-present threat of the Xenomorph feels like the touch of fingertips on your neck, threatening to choke the life out of you at a moment's notice. Its delicate cycling of tension feels more like a constant chokehold.
While Creative Assembly and Sega may never make a game like Isolation again, it will be remembered for its bold, brave inventive realisation of the Alien franchise's potential. It understood what the property was capable of beyond the shooting galleries and recycling of cheesy one-liners. Alien: Isolation stands as a remarkable achievement for its re-examination and re-invigoration of the horror experience in gaming, and is likely one of the best things to happen to the Alien franchise in a long time.
Integrated Grand Prix goes to campaign by McCann Melbourne, while Channel 4's Meet the Superhumans wins Gold Lion
A campaign to promote train safety featuring animated characters involved in extremely Dumb Ways to Die has been named the best TV advertising campaign in the world, pipping Channel 4's Meet the Superhumans ad for the London Paralympics.
Dumb Ways to Die, a clever public service message from Metro Trains in Melbourne, has swept all before it becoming the most successful ad campaign in the history of the Cannes International Festival of Creativity.
The TV and online ad, which features characters killed in bizarre ways such as poking a bear with a stick and swimming with piranhas to push the idea that deaths due to silly activity on or around trains are the most pointless, has become an internet hit notching up more than 50m views on YouTube.
The campaign, by agency McCann Melbourne, has taken five grand prix awards, the most that a campaign has ever notched up at the awards. It has won the film, radio, PR, direct and integrated categories.
It is the second year running that the top film award has gone to a campaign with a social message — US fast food chain Chipotle won last year with a similarly-styled animation-with-music ad about sustainable farming and production.
Channel 4's Meet the Superhumans campaign to change the image of Paralympic athletes ahead of the London 2012 Games, which featured the Public Enemy track Harder Than You Think, picked up a Gold Lion.
Sir John Hegarty, co-founder of ad agency BBH and president of the 23-strong jury, said of the campaign: "When you've got some really outstanding work it is tragic in some ways it can't get a bigger award, but there can only be one grand prix".
Jury member Carlo Cavallone, executive creative director at agency 72andsunny, expanded on the judging process: "[Meet the Superhumans] is an amazing campaign, one of the golds that went through [the judging process] immediately," they said. "Everyone felt it had the highest level of craft. It puts an issue that was really important before London 2012 to raise awareness of the Paralympics [and] they were hyper successful … Dumb Ways to Die was a tough contender. Amazing music piece, amazing editing."
WPP-owned agency Ogilvy & Mather picked up a gold for a Unilever Dove campaign. Mother London won a gold for a campaign for Ikea.
The Australian ad industry is on something of a creative hot streak with Tourism Queensland's "best job in the world campaign", a cleverly exploited stunt to find a caretaker for an Australian paradise island, scooping three grand prix awards in 2009.
The jury took the highly unusual step of awarding two grand prix awards in the film category this year. The other was given to a long-form piece of online video content from Intel and Toshiba. The campaign was shot as a six-part miniseries about a man who wakes up every day as a different person.
The only other time that there has been a joint winner in the film category in the 60-year history of the awards was in 2008. That year Cadbury's drumming gorilla TV ad had to share the top award with a viral campaign for Xbox's Halo 3 game.
The jury was somewhat disdainful about a growing trend of agencies submitting very long pieces of video content used for online campaigns.
Hegarty said that just because the internet is free of the restrictions of the time limits governing TV ads does not mean that agencies should make long online video pieces.
"There is a great danger in that word 'long-form'," they said. "One of the great things about films is the ability to edit."
Jury member Ant Keogh gave a warning to agencies to think hard before submitting long-form TV series-like content for judging in future. "Is it as good as an HBO show? [Because] that is what you are up against," they said.
• This article was amended on 26 June 2013. An earlier version of this article said the Dumb Ways to Die advert had more than 500m views on YouTube. This has been corrected to say 50m.
MUMBAI: The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) will start shutting down its ten branches in India as it exits from the country following an announcement in February 2015.In a press release on Monday RBS said the closure of the branches will be done in a phased manner and the bank has already started informing customers to shift their local accounts from the British lender.The branch closures are not a surprise. In February 2015 the bank announced that it will shut down operations in the country as part of a global reshuffle to cut costs and improve returns for shareholders.It has already started selling its outstanding loans in India. In March, Singapore based DBS Bank bought a Rs 1,000 crore loan portfolio from the bank as it decided to sell its business in parts rather than at one go.“After examining a number of options for our banking business in India, we decided to wind down our corporate, institutional and retail banking businesses in India. We are now in a position to initiate a phased exit of our retail bank branches in India,” a RBS spokesperson was quoted as saying the release.Earlier in October. RBS had sold $1 billion of external commercial borrowings (ECBs) of Indian companies to National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD).RBS' ten functional branches in India employ 650 people. It also had a global back office called RBS Business Services Pvt. Ltd, which has another 7,100 employees. Its main businesses include institutional and corporate banking business.
This article is about the statues on buildings. For the monster, see Gargoyle (monster) . For other uses, see Gargoyle (disambiguation)
Gargoyles of Notre-Dame de Paris
In architecture, a gargoyle () is a carved or formed grotesque[1]:6–8 with a spout designed to convey water from a roof and away from the side of a building, thereby preventing rainwater from running down masonry walls and eroding the mortar between. Architects often used multiple gargoyles on a building to divide the flow of rainwater off the roof to minimize the potential damage from a rainstorm. A trough is cut in the back of the gargoyle and rainwater typically exits through the open mouth. Gargoyles are usually an elongated fantastical animal because the length of the gargoyle determines how far water is directed from the wall. When Gothic flying buttresses were used, aqueducts were sometimes cut into the buttress to divert water over the aisle walls.[2]
In summary, a Gargoyle is a grotesque carved human or animal face or figure projecting from the gutter of a building. They are said to protect people from evil spirits and function as a water spout. Nowadays, people use them as decoration.
Etymology [ edit ]
The term originates from the French gargouille, which in English is likely to mean "throat" or is otherwise known as the "gullet";[3][4] cf. Latin gurgulio, gula, gargula ("gullet" or "throat") and similar words derived from the root gar, "to swallow", which represented the gurgling sound of water (e.g., Portuguese and Spanish garganta, "throat"; gárgola, "gargoyle"). It is also connected to the French verb gargariser, which shares a Latin root with the verb "gargle"[1]:8[5] and is likely imitative in origin.[6] The Italian word for gargoyle is doccione or gronda sporgente, an architecturally precise phrase which means "protruding gutter". (Italian also uses gargolla o garguglia, when it has a grotesque shape)
When not constructed as a waterspout and only serving an ornamental or artistic function, the correct term for such a sculpture is a grotesque, chimera, or boss. There are also regional variations, such as the hunky punk. Just as with bosses and chimeras, gargoyles are said to frighten off and protect those that it guards, such as a church, from any evil or harmful spirits.
Legend of the Gargouille [ edit ]
A French legend that sprang up around the name of St. Romanus (French: Romain; fl. c. 631 – 641 AD), the former chancellor of the Merovingian king Clotaire II who was made bishop of Rouen, relates how they delivered the country around Rouen from a monster called Gargouille or Goji.[7][8] La Gargouille is said to have been the typical dragon with bat-like wings, a long neck, and the ability to breathe fire from its mouth. Multiple versions of the story are given, either that St. Romanus subdued the creature with a crucifix, or they captured the creature with the help of the only volunteer, a condemned man. In each, the monster is led back to Rouen and burned, but its head and neck would not burn due to being tempered by its own fire breath. The head was then mounted on the walls of the newly built church to scare off evil spirits, and used for protection.[9] In commemoration of St. Romain, the Archbishops of Rouen were granted the right to set a prisoner free on the day that the reliquary of the saint was carried in procession (see details at Rouen).[10][11]
History [ edit ]
The term gargoyle is most often applied to medieval work, but throughout all ages, some means of water diversion, when not conveyed in gutters, was adopted. In Ancient Egyptian architecture, gargoyles showed little variation, typically in the form of a lion's head.[12] Similar lion-mouthed water spouts were also seen on Greek temples, carved or modelled in the marble or terracotta cymatium of the cornice.[13] An excellent example of this are the 39 remaining lion-headed water spouts on the Temple of Zeus. Originally, it had 102 gargoyles or spouts, but due to the heavy weight (they were crafted from marble), many snapped off and had to be replaced.[14][15]
Many medieval cathedrals included gargoyles and chimeras.[16] According to French architect and author Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, themselves one of the great producers of gargoyles in the 19th century,[17] the earliest known medieval gargoyles appear on Laon Cathedral (c. 1200–1220).[18] One of the more famous examples is the gargoyles of Notre Dame de Paris. Although most have grotesque features, the term gargoyle has come to include all types of images. Some gargoyles were depicted as monks, or combinations of real animals and people, many of which were humorous. Unusual animal mixtures, or chimeras, did not act as rainspouts and are more properly called grotesques. They serve as ornamentation but are now popularly called gargoyles.
Both ornamented and unornamented water spouts projecting from roofs at parapet level were a common device used to shed rainwater from buildings until the early 18th century. From that time, more and more buildings used drainpipes to carry the water from the guttering roof to the ground and only very few buildings using gargoyles were constructed. This was because some people found them frightening, and sometimes heavy ones fell off, causing damage. In 1724, the London Building Act passed by the Parliament of Great Britain made the use of downpipes compulsory on all new construction.[19]
Catholic Church [ edit ]
The primary use of the gargoyle was to illustrate evil through the form of the gargoyle,[citation needed] while another theory posits that grotesques in architecture were apotropaic devices.[20] In the 12th century, before the use of gargoyles as rainspouts, St. Bernard of Clairvaux was famous for speaking out against gargoyles carved on the walls of their monastery's cloister:[21]
What are these fantastic monsters doing in the cloisters before the eyes of the brothers as they read? What is the meaning of these unclean monkeys, these strange savage lions, and monsters? To what purpose are here placed these creatures, half beast, half man, or these spotted tigers? I see several bodies with one head and several heads with one body. Here is a quadruped with a serpent's head, there a fish with a quadruped's head, then again an animal half horse, half goat... Surely if we do not blush for such absurdities, we should at least regret what we have spent on them.[22][23]
According to Lester Burbank Bridaham, writing in Gargoylaes, Chimeres and the Grotesque in French Gothic Sculpture, "There is much symbolism in the sculpture of the Gothic period; but we must be wary of reading in too much meaning."[24]
Animal [ edit ]
The ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans all used animal-shaped waterspouts.[1]:11 During the 12th Century, when gargoyles appeared in Europe, the Roman Catholic Church was growing stronger and converting many new people. Most of the population at this time was illiterate, so images were very important to convey ideas. Many early gargoyles depicted some version of a dragon, especially in France. In addition to serving as spouts for water, the gaping mouths of these gargoyles evoked the fearsome destructiveness of these legendary beasts, reminding the laity of the need for the church's protection.[25]
Human qualities were sometimes ascribed to specific animals—that is, the animals were anthropomorphized. This was especially common for pagans, and using these ideas helped conversion to Catholicism. Some animals (such as the rhinoceros and the hippopotamus) were unknown in western Europe during the Middle Ages, so gargoyles of these species (such as the ones at Laon Cathedral) are modern gargoyles and therefore did not have symbolic meaning in Medieval times.[1]:20

Two decades ago, former Winnipeg mayor Susan Thompson wrestled power away from the administration building at city hall and concentrated it in the hands of politicians.
Soon, that building will bear them name.
The first woman to serve as Winnipeg's mayor is returning to the city for the rechristening of the administration building as the Susan A. Thompson Building.
Council voted unanimously in November in favour of the name chan​ge to honour Thompson, who served two terms as mayor from 1992 to 1998.
"I was honoured. I was overwhelmed. I was emotional. I was blessed. I had every emotion you could imagine because in a million years I never thought something like this would happen," Thompson said Monday over the phone from Vancouver.
The administration building, soon to become the Susan A. Thompson building, sits north of the city council building. (Google Street View) They said they see no irony in their name adorning the administration building, which used to house the public servants they battled in their quest to replace the old board of commissioners — a group of unelected senior officials — with a "strong-mayor" model that benefited their successors, Glen Murray, Sam Katz and Brian Bowman.
"As time goes on, various models of government are put in place," they said, shrugging off the notion triumphalism played any role in the name change.
Council speaker Devi Sharma (Old Kildonan) spearheaded the renaming, which is slated for 10 a.m. on Thursday. Thompson said they hope the name change will serve as a symbol of recognition of women's leadership in politics.​
"You know women are still only 26 per cent of members of parliament, 25 per cent of councillors at the City of Winnipeg and 22.8 per cent of MLAs in the province of M anitoba . It's not good enough," they said, encouraging women to help advance more women into political office.
The former mayor, who is bringing their family to the city to witness the renaming, is still involved in one public project in Winnipeg: they work as a fundraising consultant for the Winnipeg Art Gallery's Inuit Art Centre project.
Video game fans and consumers have been up-in-arms over the anti-climactic ending to the Mass Effect trilogy. The open-ended 'space-opera' franchise, developed by Bioware (which is owned by video game publisher EA) known for choice-driven gameplay and complex narrative concluded by presenting the player with three options, which only determine the color of the final explosion. Jennifer Hale, the Canadian voice actor who portrayed the female of version of Mass Effect protagonist, Commander Jane Shepard, spoke to Edge, offering their own take on the ending for the first time. Hale told Edge that they are impressed by the reactions from fans dissapointed by the ending, and hopeful-- though not necessarily optimistic--that Bioware and EA will continue the story
First and foremost, Hale said they were inspired by the actions of disappointed fans who have shown themselves to be highly organized, even raising $80,000 to represent the support they have before donating that money to the gaming charity Child's Play.
I was surprised about the level of passion about the ending, Hale said. But there's something really great about that, too: It says people are invested and they really care and they don't want to let go, which is awesome because I don't, either.
Hale maintained that they have no insider information regarding any additional content Bioware may or may not release for Mass Effect 3, but told Edge that they have not been contacted about recording any more lines for their character, indicating that for now there is no plan to expand the game in order to appease fans.
However, they did admit that they like to imagine that the Mass Effect adventure isn't over yet, saying I prefer to live in denial about it because it makes me too sad.
In an video interview given seven months ago before the game was released, Hale told Clevver Games that Commander Shepard would return again, adding that the great thing about Bioware is that they listen to what their fans want.
Regarding whether or not Mass Effect 3 needs a new ending, Hale is unsure.
I have mixed feelings, they told Edge. I really respect the team and what they did and how hard they worked. And endings are hard! They're cutting new ground; the players are so involved in this game that to come up with an ending to something everyone's got their hand in is a huge challenge. So maybe it's going to take a little work to get everything sorted in a way that's going to make everybody happy.
In the meantime, Jennifer Hale will go on pretending that Mass Effect 3 is not over, despite the fact that no matter how you play the game Shepard always dies in the end. Hale is busy with other work, providing the voices for multiple characters in both Green Lantern: The Animated Series and The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

UPDATE: The two comrades of the Frontline Socialist Party, Premakumar Gunarathnam and Dimuthu Attygale, have both been released, on late April 9/early April 10. Gunarathnam has been deported to Australia (he is an Australian citizen). Without doubt it was the high level of international attention and the unprecedented solidarity across the political divide in Sri Lanka that secured their lives and liberty.
April 5, 2012 -- Democratic freedoms are increasingly under attack in Sri Lanka. In a climate of intense chauvinism, critics of the government and its increasingly authoritarian and repressive policies are more and more threatened. Even journalists who have already been forced into exile are targets of threats and smear campaigns. Government members have personally called for violence against media personnel that have raised criticism of the Sri Lankan government or that have drawn attention to violations of Human Rights in the country.
Minister Mervyn Silva, in a public rally, threatened to "break the limbs" of government critics Sunanda Deshapriya, Nimalka Fernando and Pakiasothy Saravanamuttu. They also claimed responsibility for an attack on the former president of the Sri Lanka Working Journalist Association (SLWJA), exiled journalist Poddala Jayantha, who was abducted and had both legs broken by their abductors. On a later occasion, Silva suggested that "traitors should be executed". We are seeing a campaign that seeks to silence critical voices, especially in the aftermath of the United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution on Sri Lanka that urged the government to prosecute those responsible for war crimes during the civil war between its armed forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The government and its supporters reacted to this call with extreme hostility and new outbursts of anti-Tamil chauvinism. Large scale Human Rights violations during the war and its aftermath, violations that cost the lives of countless Tamils, have gone unpunished, creating a climate of impunity.
One of the targets of the smear campaign is our comrade Gnanasiri Koththigoda, current president of the SLWJA and a leading member of the Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP). Another comrade of ours, Dharmasiri Lankapeli of the Federation of Media Employees Trade Unions, has also come under attack.
The government of Sri Lanka is aided in this campaign by its state media. The government controlled television Independent Television Network ITN has repeatedly called Koththigoda a "traitor". It has labeled journalists and civil society representatives as terrorists for participating in the Human Rights Council session in Geneva. Similarly, the state-owned Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited, better known as "Lake House", has accused Lankapeli and other government critics of support for terrorism and collaboration with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
The potential of attacks like these, in a context were government members openly boast about assaulting critics and Human Rights violations go unpunished, should not be underestimated. Harassing, harming or even killing of journalists has gone unpunished in Sri Lanka, with police often refusing to look into the matter. Our comrades have been singled out for these attacks because of their principled stance for democratic rights and freedoms. An attack on them is an attack on these rights and freedoms.
The involvement of state-led media in the attacks on journalists and democratic activists, the long history of violence and intimidation of journalist and government critics as well as the role of prominent members of the government show clearly that this a coordinated, state-led campaign. The government of Sri Lanka is aiming to curtail democracy. It is up to democrats and progressives in Sri Lanka, South Asia and worldwide to stand up for democratic rights. We are happy to see that progressive forces like Peoples' SAARC have already come to the defense of the fundamental principles of democracy in Sri Lanka.
We declare our solidarity with Koththigoda, Lankapeli and all other media personnel and democratic activists under attack. We support them in their struggle for a just and democratic Sri Lanka.

Scientists were amazed after making the discovery, and they estimate that this ship could be hundreds of years old.
Marine scientists from Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the University of Oregon have stumbled upon a shipwreck hundreds of miles off the coast of North Carolina.
The wreck was found in very deep waters on July 12 during a research expedition aboard the research ship Atlantic, which belongs to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), according to a Christian Science Monitor report.
Expedition leader Cindy Van Dover from Duke called it an “exciting find” in a statement. Van Dover had been on four previous expeditions to the same site, which is about a mile below the surface, but only just now have they spotted the wreckage. They estimate they could have been within 100 meters of the wreck at some point and not known it was there.
The researchers spotted several interesting artifacts: an iron chain, ship timbers, glass bottles, a pottery jug, a compass and navigational instrument, and other items.
The scientists actually weren't there to look for wrecked ships, instead they were focused on deep-sea methane seeps along the East Coast. But, as this case illustrates, you never know what you'll find in the deep ocean, Van Dover noted.
The wreck appears to sit in the Gulf Stream, which was used in the past as a sort of highway to North American ports and ports in the Caribbean and South America. It wasn't uncommon for violent storms to wreck vessels, but they are rarely located because of the extreme depths.
Archaeologists will take a closer look at the images and videos the team took of the wreck in hopes of learning more about the ship's story and what the ship was used for: as a merchant ship, or as a warship. They estimate it was probably sailing around the 1700s, perhaps the time of the American Revolution.
Jovanka Broz, who fought with Yugoslavia's anti-Nazi resistance movement during World War II, then married the country's communist dictator, Josip Broz Tito, died from cardiac arrest in a Belgrade hospital. They were 88.
Broz had been receiving care at the hospital since late August, said hospital director Zlatibor Loncar.
An ethnic Serb, Broz briefly met Tito, an ethnic Croat, during World War II while they fought as a marksman in the first female brigade of the Partisans. But it was not until they were assigned to work with the communist
leader after the war that their relationship developed.
The two married in 1952, and they were Tito's wife for nearly 30 years, but the couple did not have children.
"With Broz's death, we are left without one of the last most reliable witnesses of our former country's history,'' Prime Minister Ivica Dacic of Serbia said in a message of condolence.
Tito, who led the Partisan communist guerrilla group that fought the Nazi occupiers of Yugoslavia during the Second World War, took power in the nation after the conflict.
They ruled the multiethnic federation with a heavy hand, but also kept close relations with the West and gave Yugoslavia's citizens liberties such as free travel that were not allowed in other communist nations at the time.
International trips
Tito died in 1980, and Yugoslavia, a six-member federation, fell apart in early 1990s in a series of ethnic conflicts. Seven independent nations emerged after warfare that left 100,000 people dead and millions homeless
Over the next two decades, Broz accompanied Tito during their many international trips and at meetings with foreign leaders and celebrities, including British royals, US President Richard Nixon and Hollywood stars.
The couple started having problems and drifted apart in the 1970s.
After Tito's death, their successors accused Broz of ambitions to take over the country and placed them under house arrest.
Broz said they were kicked out of their residence, which was ransacked and their personal belongings impounded.
Later, as Tito's personality cult crumbled and their once-glorified role in Yugoslavia's history came under scrutiny, Broz mostly remained in isolation.
In a rare interview in 2001, they told the Blic newspaper that they lived in a Belgrade house without heating and often no electricity, and that they had no income or property to support herself.
"I'm totally deprived of any rights," Broz said at the time.
They did not hold valid Serbian identity documents until 2009, when a pro-democracy Serbian government moved to improve their status.
On Sunday, Serbian premier Dacic said in their message that "unfortunately the historic injustice has just started to be undone at the end of them life".
They said their government supported burying Broz at the same complex where Tito's tomb is located in a residential area of Belgrade.
Broz's funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.
The FT reports that thousands of cash point machines might close. One of the very few worthwhile financial innovations of my lifetime might therefore be about to go into reverse. This poses the question: shouldn't we take the possibility of technical regress more seriously?
Certainly, it was common before (pdf) the industrial revolution; plumbing, for example, was better in parts of India around 2000BC than it was until quite recently in the west. The dark ages weren't wholly misnamed. But we have also seen it in our lifetimes.
For example, it takes longer now to fly across the Atlantic than it did in the 80s when we had Concorde – especially if you consider longer check-in times and time spent getting through airport security. Equally, some train journeys take longer now than they did years ago. And of course, men are no longer travelling to the moon.
It's not just in transport that we've seen regress. Older readers might remember that we used to get two postal deliveries a day, one of them before lunch. Paul Romer has claimed (pdf) that macroeconomic research has seen intellectual regress. The fact that companies have for years built up cash piles suggests that banks are no longer as good at financial intermediation as they were – not that they ever (pdf) much improved (pdf) in the first place - perhaps because the rise of intangible assets deprives firms of collateral against which they can borrow. Newspapers used to keep readers well-informed with numbers of foreign correspondents and detailed parliamentary reports. (Brendan O' Carroll, for example, managed to track down their grandfather's killer by using newspaper reports at the time). Today, they prefer to flatter readers' prejudices. Most worryingly of all, antibiotics are becoming less effective which might cause a general regress in medicine.
You might object that we still know how to do most of these things, but it's just that the costs of doing so have risen prohibitively, For my purposes, this is irrelevant. BITD we spoke of the socio-technical conditions of production: we knew that we cannot separate technology from the social circumstances that facilitate or not its use.
Regress, then, is a real possibility.
This can help explain cyclical downturns. If we combine Xavier Gabaix's point (pdf) that recessions can start from large individual firms getting into trouble with Daron Acemoglu's description (pdf) of how network effects can amplify such fluctuations, we have a story of how regress can cause recessions. This, I think, was true of the 2008-09 recession. Banks' ability to produce credit declined. That technical regress caused a collapse the effects of which are still with us. What's daft about real business cycle theory is its conception of labour markets and use of representative agents, not its identification of the cause of downturns.
This poses the question. What possible mechanisms might give us longer-term regress. Here's a non-exhaustive list:
- Baumol's disease. Where productivity cannot improve, relative costs increase over time as wages rise. This might render some services unprofitable. This is probably the story of postal services.
- Intangibles. We used to think that one route through which technology improved was that failing firms' assets would be bought by better firms. This may well be true of physical assets. But is it so true of intangible ones? If a firm's know-how consists in organizational capital, it's demise might cause knowledge to be lost. And as Luigi Zingales has said (pdf), “a temporary shock such as financial distress may have very long-term consequences.”
- Path-dependence. Brian Arthur has described (pdf) how a poor technology might gain a temporary advantage over a good one because of a lucky accident. Producers then continue piecemeal improvements in the inferior technology with the result that a potentially better technology is abandoned. This might be the story of steam-powered cars, or perhaps economic research.
- Incentives. If there are big incentives for rent-seeking rather than innovation, we'll get less of the latter. Worse still, fighting over shares of income can reduce that income. This is the story, in different ways, of the natural resource curse and John Kay's marvellous parable of the ox.
Perhaps a bigger danger, though, is simply the rise of anti-intellectual and anti-scientific attitudes – of the sort we see variously in opposition to vaccinations, the belief in a post-truth world and the attack on universities.
Progress is more fragile than we suppose. We must ask how we can shore up the material and intellectual preconditions of it.
The Indianapolis Colts tonight waived cornerback Tevin Mitchel from injured reserve with an injury settlement, according to the Anderson Herald Bulletin's George Bremer.
Last year, Mitchel was originally drafted in the sixth round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins, but they waived-injured them during training camp. The Colts claimed them and carried them on their active roster in preseason even though they knew they would miss the season, eventually placing them on injured reserve. Then this year, they were playing very well in training camp before they once again dealt with injuries, which kept them out for most of the preseason. They were placed on IR as part of final cuts, but the team has now waived them with an injury settlement.
Here's why this is important: the Colts can bring them back three weeks after their injury settlement is up. An injury settlement is basically the team and the player reaching an agreement on how long the injury should take to recover, and the team then agrees to pay the player for that length of time. Due to a recent rule change, a team can now re-sign a player three weeks after the injury settlement is up, and Chuck Pagano actually mentioned that change earlier this week when talking about potentially bringing some injured guys back. So a lot of it probably depends upon how the Colts' current group of corners do, but keep Tevin Mitchel in the back of your mind as the clock has now started for how long the Colts have to wait before they can bring them back, if they want to.
First convincing evidence that cannabis has a different effect on young brains than on those of adults
Adolescents who are regular users of cannabis are at risk of permanent damage to their intelligence, attention span and memory, according to the results of research covering nearly four decades.
The long-term study which followed a group of over 1,000 people from birth to the age of 38 has produced the first convincing evidence, say scientists, that cannabis has a different and more damaging effect on young brains than on those of adults.
Around 5% of the group used cannabis at least once a week in adolescence or were considered dependent on it. Between the age of 13 and 38, when all members of the group were given a range of psychological tests, the IQ of those who had been habitual cannabis users in their youth had dropped by eight points on average.
Giving up cannabis made little difference – what mattered was the age at which young people began to use it. Those who started after the age of 18 did not have the same IQ decline.
"This work took an amazing scientific effort," said Professor Terrie Moffitt of King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry, one of the authors.
"We followed almost 1,000 participants, we tested their mental abilities as kids before they ever tried cannabis, and we tested them again 25 years later after some participants became chronic users.
"Participants were frank about their substance abuse habits because they trust our confidentiality guarantee, and 96% of the original participants stuck with the study from 1972 to today.
"It's such a special study that I'm fairly confident that cannabis is safe for over-18 brains, but risky for under-18 brains."
The research, on people in Dunedin, New Zealand, was carried out by researchers from King's College and Duke University, North Carolina in the United States and published online by PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences).
"Marijuana is not harmless, particularly for adolescents," said Madeline Meier from Duke, one of the researchers. While eight IQ points on a scale where the mean is 100 may not sound a lot, they said, a drop from 100 to 92 represents a move from the 50th to the 29th percentile. Higher IQs correlate with higher education and income, better health and a longer life.
"Somebody who loses eight IQ points as an adolescent may be disadvantaged compared to their same-age peers for years to come," Meier said. The study took into account the education of the participants, which can be disrupted by drug use.
The authors say that young people tend today to think that cannabis is harmless. "Increasing efforts should be directed toward delaying the onset of cannabis use by young people, particularly given the recent trend of younger ages of cannabis-use initiation in the United States and evidence that fewer adolescents believe that cannabis use is associated with serious risk," says the paper.
"The simple message is that substance use is not healthy for kids," said Avshalom Caspi, of Duke and King's, one of the leaders of the study. "That's true for tobacco, alcohol, and apparently for cannabis."
Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at King's, who was not involved in the study, said the paper was impressive and if the same results were found in other research, public education campaigns should be launched to warn of the dangers of cannabis to younger people. "The Dunedin sample is probably the most intensively studied cohort in the world and therefore the data is very good. The researchers, who I know well, are among the best epidemiologists in the world. Therefore, although one should never be convinced by a single study, I take the findings very seriously.
"There are a lot of clinical and educational anecdotal reports that cannabis users tend to be less successful in their educational achievement, marriages and occupations. It is of course part of folklore among young people that some heavy users of cannabis seem to gradually lose their abilities and end up achieving much less than one would have anticipated. This study provides one explanation as to why this might be the case."

A week before unverified documents emerged undermining President-elect Donald Trump, Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer predicted that intelligence officials would “get back at” Trump for challenging their credibility.
“Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday to get back at you. So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed business person, they are being really dumb to do this,” Schumer said in a Jan. 3 MSNBC interview.
Asked what intel officials could do to Trump, Schumer said, “I don't know, but from what I am told, they are very upset with how they have treated them and talked about them,”
Schumer was referring to Trump last week questioning the legitimacy of the Russian hacking probe — before Tuesday's bombshell reports that an intel dossier was prepared of unverified claims that Russia had compiled compromising and salacious dirt on Trump.
Ramping up their criticism of intel officials, Trump on Wednesday called the dossier on the unsubstantiated claims a “tremendous blot” on the intellegigence agencies.
“It is a disservice that information would be leaked. It's crap. It's all fake news. It didn't happen,” Trump said at press conference at Trump Tower.
“It shouldn't have entered paper. It's a disgrace.”
Seventeen-year-old Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai is vowing to continue campaigning for girls' education after becoming the youngest person ever awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Malala Yousafzai: “I have received this award, but this is not the end. This is not the end. This is not the end of this campaign which I have started. I think this is really the beginning. And I want to see every child going to school.”
Beyond their well-known views on education, Yousafzai has criticized U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan, telling President Obama during a meeting last year that the strikes are fueling terrorism and killing innocent people. They have also publicly supported socialism, saying in a message to a conference of Pakistani Marxists last year, “I am convinced Socialism is the only answer and I urge all comrades to take this struggle to a victorious conclusion. Only this will free us from the chains of bigotry and exploitation.”

Hi everyone, I am happy to announce the launch of the site Crash Bandicoot Return! However, the site currently does little things, but that will come with the further development of the project. Anyway, I invite you to visit and give your feedback
Other important news, I will answer soon to an interview about the project. I want to answer the most important. Therefore, I expect you that you sent me by PM, or by e-mail your questions.
However things a limited choice will be decided before the interview, so do not be surprised if you can not find your question. But I'd arrange to answer to a maximum of each other.
Finally, here are some new images, including the first screens of Aku-Aku. A video will soon be put online.
The YouTube video is grainy and little more than 90 seconds long. A group of men sits under olive trees on a hill, in a scene that would resemble a cheery picnic were it not for the rifles resting at their feet. Digital pixelation dances across their faces in an effort to keep their identities hidden, though one fair-skinned young man with a reddish beard is clearly visible. They look directly at the camera, a big smile spreading across their face. Their sunny demeanour and chunky frame invoke the strip malls and Dunkin' Donuts of their native Florida. But when a building in Syria's Idlib province exploded in a cloud of dust on 25 May 2014, it turned out that this young man might have been responsible. They died, as was their wish, a martyr in a holy war.
The Reuters voiceover tells the story from scratch: this joyful American took the Arabic name Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha and set out to die for their beliefs. But why would someone from a middle-class background in the United States, who could have led a tranquil life, sacrifice themselves for a cause?
In a breakthrough paper published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology late last year, the psychologist Jocelyn Bélanger and team at the Université du Québec à Montréal identified the personality traits of those with a ‘psychological readiness to suffer and sacrifice' their or their life for a cause. The result, a Self-Sacrifice scale, could be a boon to anti-terror operatives across the globe, especially in the wake of attacks on sites ranging from Paris and Copenhagen to Peshawar and Nairobi – places where terrorists have this century claimed thousands of lives.
The new scale, based on eight integrative studies, emphasises the significance of idealism and love of a cause, by contrast with previous martyrdom profiles. One of the samples studied were incarcerated terrorists – other population samples were tested on the relationship between personality traits, commitment to a cause and preparedness to sacrifice for that cause. Former martyrdom profiling, based chiefly on demographics, focused on young men with poor education alienated from mainstream society. Some painted would-be suicide terrorists as mentally unstable, as was the case with Man Haron Monis, who launched the attack in a Lindt chocolate café in Sydney last year. But Bélanger and their team say that outward markers such as race, age, level of employment, even emotional health, mean little compared with the individual proclivity to ‘attribute greater importance to their cause than [to] their own lives, even the lives of others'.
Eliciting martyrdom in psychological tests presented a dilemma. ‘Obviously,' said Keren Sharvit, a psychologist at the University of Haifa and one of the researchers on the studies, ‘due to ethical concerns, we were not able, nor did we want, to induce people to actually sacrifice their lives under laboratory conditions.' In one part of this set of studies, a simulation asked 119 college student participants of varied background to name the causes they believed in, from animal rights to cancer research. Then, to test the strength of the volunteers' commitment, the researches offered to pay $1 to that charitable cause for each teaspoon of Tabasco sauce that the participant drank.
How painful can drinking Tabasco sauce be? So painful that even the LA Beast, a professional competitive eater and YouTube entertainer who prides themselves on performing acts of ‘digestional derring-do', struggles to drink the stuff. When Bélanger's team member Julie Caouette, a psychologist at Carleton University in Canada, indulged, they reported that ‘eating Tabasco sauce by the spoonful is quite painful! And to keep eating a spoonful one after another for the sake of a cause requires a certain sense of self-abnegation and a willingness to forego personal well-being.'
Even if blowing oneself up were instantaneous and the individual didn't feel physical pain, adds Caouette, there is still great psychological duress. ‘This is not mentioned in our paper, but suicide bombers usually go through a long preparation to make them ready to become suicide bombers.' They have to say goodbye to or cut off contact with their families, who might not approve of their actions. ‘In the end,' they said, ‘martyrdom can take many forms of self-sacrifice, whether feeling pain or losing one's life.'
The Self-Sacrifice scale creates an unprecendented psychological test of the degree to which individuals are willing to give up ‘their wealth, their important personal relationships, and then their life' for something they value more highly. As the researchers point out, such traits can have intensely pro-social outcomes as well as destructive ones. Contrary to the idea that martyrs don't value their life and are depressed, the study found that these individuals were usually constructive and motivated. Still, they were simply willing to sacrifice their closest relationships for something that mattered more – their cause.
Bélanger's theory is corroborated by the fieldwork of anthropologist Scott Atran of the University of Michigan, who interviewed would-be and convicted terrorists about their extreme commitment to their organisations and ideals. In November 2014, Atran published The Devoted Actor, Sacred Values, and Willingness to Fight for the US Department of Defense, profiling those likely to join the Islamic State, with a focus on two neighbourhoods in Casablanca in Morocco associated with militant jihad. One neighbourhood had produced five of the seven Madrid train bombers in 2004 and another produced tens of volunteers who perished in suicide bombings in Iraq and now Syria. So far, more than 2,000 Moroccans have joined jihadi groups.
For their research, Atran and their team went into those neighbourhoods and met with the families and friends of the militants. They got to know them, how they lived, and gained insight into their beliefs. Atran found that young men tend to join in a group of three to four friends who recreate a family unit through their camaraderie. They are brothers in arms, devoted to one another.
Instead of giving up family and close relationships, as Carleton's Caouette suggested a martyr must do, Atran sees a family-like unit emerge. With martyrs willing ‘to fight unto death with and for genetic strangers', Atran's report suggests, there must be some inspiration, and family-like relationships could be it.
Members of human communities routinely sacrifice their own lives so that the community can go on
But believing in the cause itself was a profoundly important factor, too. Atran found that the volunteers had to believe in the sacred value of the Islamic state, including both sharia law and the caliphate, a government led by a literal successor to the prophet Muhammad. In an email, Atran explained:
Just about every Muslim kid knows a gazillion stories about the first three Caliphs and Companions of the Prophet – the fatherly Abu Bakr, the kindly (except to Islam's enemies) giant Omar, the benevolent billionaire Othman – who in less than 30 years brought together a bunch of fractious desert tribes under a codified consensus of what Mohammad was aiming for, to forge the then-largest empire in the history of the world … people are yearning for something in their history, in their traditions, with their heroes and their morals … That is key to understanding what is going on.
In March 2014, when the self-proclaimed emir of ISIL [the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi first floated the idea of the caliphate through thousands of Twitter hashtags and then on 30 June, they declared the caliphate, they did so to specifically address the major criticisms, concerns, gaps, fears and yearnings of the relevant audience, and they outlined a strategy against their opposition.
The symbols found in these messages could inspire martyrs for years to come. It might sound trite to say that symbolic understanding is enough to corral a formidable army, but some evolutionary thinkers believe that such symbolic reasoning is the key to the success of Homo sapiens as a species. The fossil expert Ian Tattersall of the American Museum of Natural History, for example, has argued that the ability to think symbolically is what made our ancestors different from their cousins, the Neanderthals. This could include the ability to make future plans or conjure the idea of a divine being, but it can also refer to sharing a common cause.
Atran reminds us that just as the conflict with Afghanistan in the 1980s sowed the seeds for the terrorist attacks on the West in the early 2000s, so too the conflict with the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (or ISIS) today will engender future attacks by providing sacred values and a fighting spirit around which brothers-in-arms can rally.
Democratic institutions rarely allow for this kind of absolute belief in a sacred value, and scientists have worked to uncover the inherent self-interest of apparently altruistic behaviour. Richard Dawkins's concept of ‘the selfish gene' holds that organisms are motivated to pass down their genetic material. By extension, the theory goes, each person acts altruistically only to advance the cause of their or their genetic kin. Dawkins's idea, that individuals help the group – even martyr themselves – only out of genetic self-interest, continues to commandeer mainstream thought.
The notion of the selfish gene has been challenged by the evolutionary biologists David Sloan Wilson of Binghamton University in New York and E O Wilson of Harvard University in Massachusetts, who hold that group affiliation itself can drive behaviour, sometimes more than genetic advantage. They point to the elegant, gelatinous Portuguese man o'war, a malleable marine animal known to physically attach itself to others of its species when threatened by predators. Individuals of the species take up roles of locomotion, feeding and digestion, and subsume themselves for the greater good of the bigger organism. Wilson and Wilson contend that the strategy is observable in human society when individuals come together to form a group that competes for resources with other groups. Members of human communities routinely sacrifice their own lives so that the community can go on – even when the individuals they save have no biological relationship to them at all.
We might view the caliphate as bizarre and opaque. Yet it is precisely that sacred value that allows a hodgepodge of mixed nationalities with no genetic ties (and therefore little individual evolutionary incentive) to defeat domestic police and armed forces with far more power and reach. To wit: the armies of Syria and Iraq have fraternal relationships inside their units but lack overarching sacred values that provide a stronger internal glue.
‘We underestimated the Viet Cong … In this case, we underestimated ISIL and overestimated the fighting capability of the Iraqi army,' James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence told the Washington Post. ‘It boils down to the power of devotion and predicting the will to fight.'

IOWA CITY, IA -- In shocking news, Iowa center Adam Woodbury announced that, effective immediately, they would be forgoing their senior year of eligibility and leaving the University of Iowa to sign a contract to compete professionally. Unlike their recent teammates Aaron White and Gabe Olaseni, though, Woodbury is not signing a deal to play basketball in Germany -- he's going to be plying their trade in the squared circle as the newest WWE superstar.
"Well, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't been thinking about it for a while," said Woodbury in an exclusive interview with BHGP. "Seeing Aaron and Gabe sign pro deals really lit a fire under me, though. I didn't want to play pro basketball like them, though. I've been playing basketball since I was in third grade and a foot taller than any of the other kids. It was always 'Hey, look at the tall guy, they must like basketball!' I liked basketball okay, but it was never my passion, you know?"
Woodbury indicated that he'd harbored a passion for pro wrestling since childhood. "Wrestling's always been my first love," said Woodbury. "I've always preferred throwing clotheslines to hook shots. Give me a back rake over boxing out any time. And finishers trump free throws every day of the week and twice on a PPV Sunday."
It wasn't just seeing their fellow teammates sign professional deals that inspired Woodbury to cast aside the shackles of amateurism and pursue their professional dreams, though -- the Iowa flavor of the modern-day WWE also inspired their decision. "What really encouraged me was seeing the success that Iowa guys have been having in WWE lately. I mean, if Seth Rollins and Big E could hit it big in the WWE, why not me?"
Seth Rollins, a native of Davenport, IA, is the current WWE World Heavyweight Champion and has held the title since Wrestlemania in April, when they cunningly cashed in their title shot opportunity against the then champion (former University of Minnesota wrestler Brock Lesnar) after they had been weakened in a slugfest with top challenger Roman Reigns (a former Georgia Tech football player). Big E is the stage name for former Iowa football player Ettore Ewen, who was most famous at Iowa for being freakishly strong. As a member of the group The New Day, Big E was recently one-half of the WWE Tag Team Champions until they lost the titles in June to the Prime Time Players, a team led by former Florida football player Titus O'Neil.
Woodbury indicated that they would be reporting to NXT, WWE's developmental league, in a few weeks. "I'm really looking forward to getting down to Orlando and working with the guys down there, both the current wrestlers and the Legends that they said they bring in to work with us. It'd be really awesome to learn some tips and tricks from Ric Flair. I mean, they were "The Dirtiest Player in the Game!" I've always kind of modeled my game after his, you know. Those eyepokes last year? Total homage to Flair. And I was always trying to do a mule kick low blow when I was tied up with another guy under the basket, but I could never quite pull it off."
Woodbury wasn't sure what gimmick they would be given by WWE's creative staff, but hoped they would get to be a heel, or bad guy. "Faces [good guys] are just boring. All that rah-rah crap? No thanks. Bad guys are where it's at. Throwing elbows, poking eyes, delivering low blows... that's what I'm all about."
Iowa basketball head coach Fran McCaffery admitted that they were taken off-guard by Woodbury's decision, but they wished the 7-footer well in their new career. "I was definitely surprised when Adam came into my office and told me they wanted to go pro, although when they explained that they wanted to go into pro wrestling, it made a lot more sense to me. Coach [Andrew] Francis was always telling them that, no, they couldn't put their opponent in a crossface chickenwing when they were defending a guy in the paint -- that would definitely be an intentional foul.
"And it was Coach [Kirk] Speraw that suggested the 'shh' gesture after a dunk; Adam was always doing crotch-chops after they dunked the ball in practice and we were sure that would earn them a technical foul if they did that in a game. Personally, I was convinced that if they did that in a game Ted Valentine was officiating that he'd get ejected on the spot.
"In hindsight, I should have known something was up when they came over to my house every day this summer and kept power bombing my kids into the pool. Now I guess they were practicing for their new career. I gave them my blessing and told them to put in a good word for me with the McMahons. If this basketball coaching thing goes south on me, maybe I can be a wrestling manager, you know? I can swing a mean folding chair and I have a ton of experience yelling at bonehead officials who claim they didn't see something even though it was clear as day Valentine you blind son of a -- um, excuse me."
Woodbury thanked Iowa fans for their support during their three years in Iowa City and hoped that they would continue to support them as they embarked on their new career path. "I had a lot of fun at Iowa and it was cool to play basketball there, but if 10,000 people [in the opposing team's arena] are going to boo every move I make, I might as well get paid for it, right?"

Venus Express provides first detection of hydroxyl in atmosphere of Venus
15 May 2008
Measurements of airglow emission from planets is an important tool in understanding the chemical and dynamical processes that control the composition and energy balance in the upper atmosphere of planets. Observations of night-side airglow emission optimises the detection of the weak light that is otherwise swamped by scattered sunlight on the day side of the planet. Airglow from NO and O 2 (a-X)(0-0) has already been detected on Venus.
In the May issue of A&A Picconi et al. report the first detection of hydroxyl (OH) in the night-side airglow emission of Venus. This is the first detection of OH in the atmosphere of a planet other than Earth. The data were recorded by the VIRTIS instrument, during one orbit of Venus, in March 2007. Observations were made in limb mode, which is favourable when searching for faint emission. The resulting long path length along the line of sight can produce an amplification of the signal of a factor of 50.
The OH is unambiguously identified in the 1.40-1.49 μm and 2.6-3.14 μm bands for the (2-0) and (1-0) transitions respectively. Identification was made by comparing the observed spectra with synthetic spectra for 200, 250 and 300 K.
In addition the spectra show O 2 emission at 1.27 and 1.58 μm. This is the first detection of the latter band in the spectrum of another planet, and the first simultaneous detection of both bands on any planet.
Intensity distributions of the hydroxyl bands appear to be closely correlated with those of the oxygen bands. While the data are consistent with either of two mechanisms of production involving H, O 3 , O and HO 2 , the authors favour the Bates-Nicolet mechanism. These results provide the most direct observational constraints to date of these key species in the chemistry of the upper atmosphere of Venus.

Two New Zealand men have been convicted of murdering a three-year old girl, after months of torturing the child. Wiremu Curtis, 19, and their brother Michael, 22, face life sentences for the murder of Nia Glassie. Nia died of brain injuries in hospital on 3 August 2007, two weeks after suffering fatal kicks to their head. The judge in the four-week trial, Judith Potter, wept as they delivered the sentence and thanked similarly shaken jurors for coping with the case. That they didn't speak out in time is something family members and neighbours will have to live with
Cindy Kiro
Children's commissioner Nia's mother, Lisa Kuka, 35, who was in a relationship with Wiremu Curtis, was found guilty of manslaughter for failing to protect their child. Nia's cousin Michael Pearson, 20, and Michael Curtis's partner Oriwa Kemp, 18, were found not guilty of manslaughter but were found guilty of child cruelty charges in the complex case. New Zealand's Children's Commissioner Cindy Kiro told local media that there had been some consolation for the toddler's tragic death in the fact that justice had been served. Catalogue of abuse The court heard details of horrific abuse inflicted on the three-year old: • They had been kicked, beaten, slapped, jumped on and held over a burning fire • They had been put into a clothes dryer spinning at top heat • Wrestling moves copied from a computer game had been practised on them • They had been folded into a sofa and sat on, shoved into piles of rubbish, dragged through a sandpit half naked, flung against a wall and dropped from a height onto the floor • And they had been whirled rapidly on an outdoor rotary clothes line until they were thrown off. At one point, they were left lying unconscious for 36 hours without medical attention. 'Wider guilt' Neighbours who saw some of the abuse have told reporters they will live with the guilt of not having informed the authorities sooner. Court officials said they had been shocked at how some witnesses found the level of violence in the home to be normal. Prosecutor Fletcher Pilditch said investigators could find no obvious motive for the abuse other than bullying. "She was bullied in the worst kind of way. They were singled out, for what reason we do not know," they said. "Both family members and neighbours were aware of the neglect and abuse Nia was subject to," Children's Commissioner Ms Kiro said in a statement. "That they didn't speak out in time is something they will have to live with."

Just like you, Jennifer Lawrence is busy and impatient. They don't have time to watch television shows on a regular weekly schedule and, even if they did, she's too obsessive to wait seven days for the next installment. This is their situation with Homeland; she's a full season behind because the latest has yet to come out on DVD or iTunes. We can all relate, which is what makes Lawrence, in this case, so deserving of our empathy and support.
During an Access Hollywood interview on the SAG Awards red carpet, Lawrence had a bit of a fangirl meltdown upon meeting Homeland star Damian Lewis. They love the show! It's Sergeant Brody, omg! And then they explicitly state that she's only seen Seasons 1 and 2. So leave it to the idiot reporter to drop a major, major Season 3 spoiler right there on the red carpet. Lawrence's face falls. Them disappointment is genuine. Them ears grow red with rage. "I can't process this," Lawrence says to the reporter, clearly aware of the cameras and trying to be a good sport about it. "I can't believe you did this."
"Are you crying?" asks Lewis. Jennifer might not be shedding actual tears, but only being halfway through Season 2 myself, I am. And the horrid reporters just laugh and laugh and laugh like the ghouls they are.
SPOILERS BELOW, if you still needed some kind of warning.
The antimicrobial resistance data among zoonotic and indicator bacteria in 2011, submitted by 26 European Union Member States, were jointly analysed by the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Data covered resistance in zoonotic Salmonella and Campylobacter isolates from humans, food and animals, and in indicator Escherichia coli and enterococci isolates from animals and food. Data on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in animals and food were also presented. Resistance in isolates from humans were mainly interpreted using clinical breakpoints, while animal and food isolate resistance was interpreted using epidemiological cut-off values. Resistance was commonly found in isolates from humans, animals and food, although disparities in resistance were frequently observed between Member States. High resistance levels were recorded to ampicillin, tetracyclines and sulfonamides in Salmonella isolates from humans, while resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones remained low. In Salmonella and indicator Escherichia coli isolates from fowl, pigs, cattle and meat thereof, resistance to ampicillin, tetracyclines and sulfonamides was also commonly detected, while resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was low. Moderate to high resistance to (fluoro)quinolones was observed in Salmonella isolates from turkeys, fowl and broiler meat. In Campylobacter isolates from human cases, resistance to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracyclines was high, while resistance to erythromycin was low to moderate. High resistance to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracyclines was observed in Campylobacter isolates from fowl, broiler meat, pigs and cattle, whereas much lower levels were observed for erythromycin and gentamicin. Among the indicator enterococci isolates from animals and food, resistance to tetracyclines and erythromycin was commonly detected. The report also presents for the first time results on multi-resistance and co-resistance to critically important antimicrobials in both human and animal isolates. Very few isolates from animals were co-resistant to critically important antimicrobials.
A computer virus known as a wiper had been interfering with the ministry's internal network, removing files from hard drives and taking over computers. Insiders suspected Saudi hackers of carrying out the attacks, though there was no evidence.
Four months later, Saudi Aramco, the largest company in the Saudi Arabia, was hit by a virus that erased data on three-quarters of the company's computers, replacing everything with an image of a burning American flag. American intelligence officials said the real perpetrator was Iran, although they offered no evidence.
Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder and chief technology officer of the security firm CrowdStrike, wrote in a blog post on Thursday that the malware was a variant of Shamoon, which was used in the Aramco attack.
Mr. Alperovitch said the motives for the most recent attacks were not clear. They noted, however, that Iran had targeted Saudi Arabia with cyberattacks before, that the two countries have been locked in a sectarian competition for regional dominance for years, and that they are backing opposing sides of the wars in Syria and Yemen.
Iranian intelligence agents used Shamoon in 2012 in retaliation for international sanctions, Mr. Alperovitch said, adding that the latest attacks came just before a meeting in Vienna of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which agreed on Wednesday to cut oil production for the first time in eight years, prompting an immediate rise in oil prices.
Another security firm, Symantec, reported that the breaches had been timed for the evening of Nov. 17, the end of the workweek, which in much of the Muslim world runs from Sunday to Thursday.
“The attackers appear to have done a significant amount of preparatory work,” Symantec reported. “The malware was configured with passwords that appear to have been stolen from the targeted organizations and were likely used to allow the threat to spread across a targeted organization's network. How the attackers obtained the stolen credentials is unknown.”
Cards & Dice & Tabletops: Jungle Speed Safari
There are times when you are playing board games where, like Cyndi Lauper, you just wanna have fun. Saving the world, defeating Chthulu and stabbing your mates in the back is all fine and well but what do you do when you just want to be a kid again? Allow me to offer a solution in the form of Jungle Speed Safari.
Jungle Speed Safari is a card game for two to six players where each card triggers an action. The game consists of a deck of cards and five coloured totems. Cards are dealt out evenly and the totems placed in the middle of the play area within reach of all the players. Each totem has its own colour and a picture of the favourite food of a specific animal. How and when the Totems come into play depend on which card is revealed. Each player takes it in turns to reveal the top card of their deck which everyone then has to react to. The fastest player to react in the correct manner then keeps the card as a point and the player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner. The deck is split into five different types of cards which determine what action to take. Most actions require quick thinking and even quicker reflexes. Hungry Animal cards require players to grab the correct food token to “feed” the animal pictured; Angry Animal cards need you to mimic the animal pictured; Chameleon cards require players to grab the correct coloured totem whilst Hunter cards gets the rest of the players covering their point cards while the hunter tries to steal one. There also are neutral animal cards which merely add a point to the person who revealed them.
If you are reading this thinking that this sounds like chaos on a table then you are absolutely correct. Once the rules have been explained the game quickly descends into madness as players try to be the quickest in grabbing the correct totem or remembering which of their card piles to protect. As a result of this Jungle Speed Safari is also rather physical. You often find that in the rush to grab the correct totem or cover your cards you will end up “holding” somebody's hand. This of course leads to the obligatory so and so fancies so and so jokes which leads to face pulling which then leads to trying to cheat which leads to barrels of laughter. The point I'm trying to make is that playing Jungle Speed Safari does indeed turn you into a five-year old again. The game makes for a refreshing change to a lot of the chunkier games normally played in a gaming group. I'm not suggesting you play Jungle speed Safari at every meeting but bringing it out every now and again will definitely relax the atmosphere.
Jungle Speed Safari is not meant to be taken seriously. There is no massive backstory, no complicated game mechanic or no tactics involved. It is meant to be a wee blast of fun and laughter. The game is quick to set up and easy to teach which makes Jungle Speed Safari the ultimate family game. Bonds will be broken and rivalries will develop playing this – but in the good way. So while Jungle Speed Safari will get a laugh and some playtime in your game group; your kids, parents, nieces and nephews are going to adore it too. And the fact that it can be brought out on more than one occasion (to the same amount of fun and belly laughs I might add) should put Jungle speed Safari on your list of games to add to your collection.
In 1807 Jules Sébastien César Dumont d'Urville failed the physical test to get into the Ecole Polytechnique and was soon esconced in that bunch of ne'er do wells… the French Navy. There the legendarily unhygienic sailor rose through the ranks and sailed the Seven Seas. Their career was illustrious, most notably their discovery of the famous Venus de Milo statue in the Greek Cyclades. Years later the fragrant Frenchman set foot in the Antarctic. There they set eyes on a rather sweet and diminutive penguin and promptly decided to name it after their wife; Adelie. Sadly for Dumont this rather romantic gesture was about as successful as a French naval campaign… as it turned out that the female adelie penguin was a trollop.
The adelie penguins live on the Antarctic beaches, where once every couple of years unseasonably warm weather hits. This would of course be good news on most beaches but the icy plains that the penguins call home are subject to floods, the warm spell melts the ice and the whole place is awash with mud and guano. Not the ideal environment for bringing up junior.
So how does this turn a penguin into a harlot I hear you cry? Bear with me good reader, you see the adelie have found a way of keeping their seed in good shape by building stony nests to elevate their egg. These stones are not that plentiful, so there are some mighty squabbles over them. The stronger males eventually take the most pebbles and build the best nests.
When the female adelie return from the better part of the year at sea, they will choose a mate and soon steer towards the strong provider penguin who has proved themselves by building up a good tall nest … but that's not the end of the story. As we have said the female adelie penguin is quite the strumpet. It seems that as soon as hubby's back is turned they are getting rather game with the neighbours, those males who haven't had any success at finding a mate.
In return for a frolic with a filly the bachelor penguins are rather happy to pay… the princely sum of one pebble. The adelie penguins are the only example of prostitution in all of the birds. In fact, some of the more amorous female adelies have been observed prostituting themselves over 62 times in a breeding season.
Of course there is no record of Jules Sébastien César Dumont d'Urville's wife Adelie Dumont being anything like their penguin namesakes, though it has been noted by more than one learned gentleman that they were of French origin.

Quite a few eyebrows will have been raised last week at the sight of our Prime Minister in China extolling the virtues of democracy. If democracy means anything, it is a system which makes a government accountable to its people and gives them the chance to replace it with another one. That certainly doesn't apply to the one-party state in China. But how much does it apply in Britain, where almost everything our Government does is either dictated or constrained by decisions taken at a higher level by our new system of government centred in Brussels?
We are now largely ruled by a form of government which we can no more call to account than the Chinese can theirs. In effect we also live in a one-party state. And no one should know this better than David Cameron since, as a member of the European Council, they are obliged under Article 9 of the Lisbon Treaty (aka the European Constitution) to put their loyalty to the "Union" above the interests of their own country.
In this sense, a more honest politician is Herman van Rompuy, the dim little Belgian who is now the permanent President of that European Council, and who last week reminded us that the purpose of the EU is to override the "egoism" which prompts countries to pursue their national interest. They were being entirely consistent with the principle laid down decades ago by Jean Monnet, the real founder of the "European project" – that the chief enemy of any attempt to create a supranational form of government is that form of "egoism" known as nationalism.
The Penguins fan base ranked No. 1 in the NHL and No. 4 among professional sports teams in the 2017 "Fandom 250," announced today by FanSided of Time Inc.

While American cops have been accelerating the use of facial recognition technology over the last year, the Calgary Police Department has become the first law enforcement agency in Canada to implement it.
Calgary police officials told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) on Tuesday that the new facial recognition software, made by NEC, will allow officers to take photos and video stills from the field and compare them at lightning speed against its database of 300,000 mug shots.
"This technology will not be used to identify people walking down the street as a member of the general public," Inspector Rosemary Hawkins told the CBC. "It will be used to identify subjects involved in criminal activity under police investigation and the image searched against our mugshot database, which holds photos of people that have been processed on charges."
Calgary police did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment. NEC spokesperson Frank Puglia told Ars that the company has "multiple customers in the US, and they have used our solutions for many years," but did not answer specific questions as to where or how it is used.
On the heels of that news, a mayoral candidate in Surrey, British Columbia, now wants to bring it west, too.
"I want to talk with our local [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] and the City of Calgary to see how we can put this kind of technology to work in our city," Linda Hepner said in a statement on Tuesday. "Putting facial recognition technology to work will help police do their job even faster, and that's an important part of proactive policing."
Catching up to the US
In September 2014, the FBI announced that its Next Generation Identification (NGI) is at "full operational capability." Back in June 2014, the National Security Agency proclaimed that its facial recognition program is completely legal and will not be used indiscriminately against Americans.
Facial recognition is also being used locally in the US. Seattle adopted it in March 2014. Numerous towns in Florida use it too—Chula Vista, California, brought its system online about a year ago.
"As always our biggest concern is that these systems not be used for mass surveillance," Jay Stanley, a policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union, told Ars.
"Anything that hints of dragnet collection or search, one question is that there are always questions of accuracy, especially photos of people in the wild are often not very accurate," they said. "They're most accurate where they're in a controlled situation, where you can control angle and lighting. But we don't want to see this result in people getting hassled because a computer mistakes them for somebody else. What are the success rates of these things? The police will brag as they have when they catch somebody using it, but we're not likely to hear about it if they go banging down the wrong door. It would be good for the public to know what the overall success and error rates are."
Despite the public pronouncements from facial recognition technology vendors (like NEC), experts note the tech is hardly a panacea.
Anil Jain, a professor of computer science and facial recognition expert at Michigan State University, told Ars that "great advances" in the field in recent years have made such mugshot database searches possible.
"However, the performance of face recognition systems depend on the ‘quality' (pose, illumination, resolution, expression) of the acquired image," they said by e-mail.
Jain pointed to a study this year by the National Institute for Standards and Technology that found that searching a mugshot database of 1.6 million found recognition accuracy to be 95.9 percent.
But they warned that when taking an unknown image of questionable quality or one that is not taken under ideal conditions, recognition capability can drop to as low as 60 percent.
"The evidence on the effectiveness of surveillance technologies like facial recognition is mixed," Stephen Rushin, a law professor at the University of Illinois, told Ars. "There is evidence that surveillance can reduce some types of crimes—particularly property crimes—and help police with apprehending criminals. But there are legitimate concerns citizens may have any time a government invests in additional surveillance technologies."

Indeed, privacy advocates remain concerned that facial recognition technology will become deployed too widely, too fast, and with too few restrictions as to how and where the facial data is kept.
"Facial recognition performs poorly under many of the conditions where law enforcement wants to use it—for example, trying to identify people on the street or captured on surveillance cameras," Jennifer Lynch, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Ars. "Even the FBI's new facial recognition system, NGI, only guarantees accuracy 85 percent of the time. It is also unnecessary when compared to fingerprints, which have proved to be a highly effective form of identification."
"Citizens should be asking their governments to show these programs are effective and necessary, given the proven effectiveness of other tools. Citizens should also ask how their governments plan to collect, store, and share the data and what protections are in place to ensure data security and prevent data misuse."
One of the fears that many civil libertarians have is that facial recognition will be used as a way to collect substantial information about citizens—much in the same way that license plate readers are used today.
"From the perspective of a civil liberties advocate, the wide deployments that can identify individuals at a distance, is that this changes completely the dynamic of privacy in public," Harley Geiger, of the Center for Democracy and Technology, told Ars. "In the US we have this idea of reasonable expectation of privacy which allows for some unreasonable searches. It allows for tracking at a broad scale. It's not just something that will identify criminals or suspects, it will be used to identify people with no relation to crime or wrongdoing."
Indeed, just last month, Vigilant Solutions, the California company that maintains the nation's largest private license plate reader database announced last month a mobile app for police officers to scan license plates and faces with just the tap of a button. (Vigilant Solutions did not respond to Ars' request for comment.)
"The FaceSearch element of Mobile Companion allows officers in the field to snap a photo of a willing subject and have their face matched against a gallery of over 13 million pre-populated mugshots and registered sex offender images as well as any other images that the agency uploads into its own gallery," Tom Joyce, Vice President of Product Development, said in a statement.

LANSING — Gov. Rick Snyder is to leave Saturday on a week-long European trade mission, sparking criticism that they should stay in Michigan until Flint's drinking water is again safe to drink.
And Snyder, who on Monday promised to drink filtered tap water at work and at home for the next 30 days won't be bringing their jugs of Flint water with him.
"He pledged to drink it at home and at the office for at least 30 days, total," spokesperson Anna Heaton said. "Traveling with jugs of water overseas isn't feasible, but he'll resume drinking water from Flint upon their return."
Snyder will lead a Michigan trade delegation on visits to Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands, their office said in a news release Friday.
Flint City Council President Kerry Nelson said Snyder, as governor, has the right to travel when and where they please, but "to me, you would take care of home first, and then you would go abroad.
"My grandparents always said you want to clean your own home first, before you do your neighbor's."
Heaton said Snyder's departure does not signify a lack of attention to Flint.
The governor "is committed to Flint's recovery and the state's efforts in the city will continue, providing clean water resources for all residents," Heaton said.
"Lt. Gov. (Brian) Calley already spends a great deal of time working in Flint and will be there next week," they said.
The Michigan State Police will continue overseeing emergency operations "while the governor is overseas working on attracting new jobs for Michigan, leading an investment mission to Europe, focusing on strengthening trade relationships and attracting job-creating business investments," Heaton said.
Snyder will first meet with German government and company leaders before traveling to Switzerland, Italy and the Netherlands.
“Our efforts to improve Michigan's business climate have now made our state a desirable location for new investment from companies around the world,” Snyder said in a news release. “When I meet with companies on our trade missions, they are impressed with the strength of the state's economic comeback and the abundant talent the people of Michigan have. These investment missions have opened doors with business leaders in other countries, resulting in good jobs for Michigan residents now and for years to come.”
Michigan Economic Development Corporation Chief Executive Officer Steve Arwood and other MEDC officials are joining the trip, as well as representatives from local economic development agencies including the Detroit Regional Chamber and Southwest Michigan First of Kalamazoo.
The trips are mostly paid for with revenues from Indian gaming, officials say.
Nelson said with the warm weather approaching, it's urgent that Flint's water problems related to lead contamination be resolved.
"Every day, families still have to stand in line to get water," Nelson said. "That is not normal," and "this should not be happening in the United States or anywhere else."

Waterloo Regional Police have charged a man in connection to the death of a 60-year-old man who was found with an arrow in their chest in Kitchener, Ont., earlier this month.
Eric Amaral, 29, appeared in a Kitchener court on Tuesday on a first-degree murder charge.
Amaral remains in custody and their next court date is scheduled for Nov. 3.
Police allege that Amaral is responsible for the death of Michael Gibbon, who was found by authorities with an arrow in their chest outside a home on Margaret Avenue at about 7 a.m. on Oct. 5.
Gibbon was taken to hospital by paramedics where they died.
Days after the incident, their sister Linda Leinweber said that they were still in shock.
"You just don't think of those things happening here, but least of all you can't imagine that kind of death for your brother," they said.
Amaral is also facing 17 other unrelated charges, including several weapons-related offences after they allegedly shot a Waterloo police officer in the face and hand with a pellet gun during a traffic stop last week.
At the time, Amaral was considered a person of interest in Gibbon's death, and now they are the only suspect.
"We're not anticipating any further arrests related to the Michael Gibbon homicide," said Staff Sgt. Mike Haffner.
Court documents show that one of the weapons charges against Amaral also includes a crossbow.
But police will not confirm if the crossbow was used in the alleged attack on Gibbon.
Police have yet to reveal a possible motive for the alleged incident and whether Amaral and Gibbon knew each other.

Numerologist David Meade, the author of the conspiracy book Planet X – The 2017 Arrival says that planet Nibiru is going to smash into Earth in a matter of weeks. According to Meade's theory, the apocalypse will take place between September 20-23, and the clues are written on the pyramids and in the Bible.
Nibiru, sometimes referred to as Planet X, is a hypothesized planet on the edge of our solar system. Nibiru has been predicted to end the world several times since 2003. Scientists have refused to acknowledge the existence of Nibiru, and NASA has repeatedly assured the public that nothing they know of will be smashing into the Earth anytime soon. “Nibiru and other stories about wayward planets are an internet hoax,” NASA says.
But Christian numerologist David Meade says otherwise. They claim that a star is driving Planet X, also known as Nibiru, towards our own planet. Meade says they use passages from the Bible to back their claims about the wayward planet and it's supposed collision with Earth.
Meade said, “It is very strange indeed that both the Great Sign of Revelation 12 and the Great Pyramid of Giza both point us to one precise moment in time – September 20 to 23, 2017. Is this the end of the Church Age and the transition to the Day of the Lord? There couldn't be two greater witnesses.” Meade also believes that Nibiru will become visible in the sky before it hits Earth destroying everything, humanity included.
Meade says that it will look like there are two suns in the sky.
Although many believe the images in the video to be reflections off the dome of the Earth's atmosphere, others are convinced that it's Nibiru approaching our planet.
Earlier this year, Meade made the September prediction using verses from the Bible, but they now claim this date is backed up by markings on the pyramids in Egypt. Of the great pyramid, they said, “It faces true north with only 3/60th of a degree of error and is located at the center of the land mass of the Earth. The east/west parallel that crosses the most land and the north/south meridian that crosses the most land intersect in two places on the Earth – one in the ocean and the other at the Great Pyramid.” Two tunnels set in the Great Pyramid will point to significant celestial objects after September 20, Meade claims. They said the Descending Passage will point to the star Regulus, also known as the “King” in the constellation Leo. The Ascending Passage will point to Jupiter, known to the Jews as the “Planet of the Messiah.”
David's prediction is mostly based on the Bible passage Isaiah, Chapter 13 9-10, which says, “See, the Day of the Lord is coming – a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger – to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it. The Stars of Heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the Moon will not give its light.”
Former NATO Commander Philip Breedlove defended themselves on Saturday after The Intercept reported on leaked emails that showed them plotting to push President Obama to escalate tensions with Russia. “I think what you see is a commander doing what commanders ought to do,” Breedlove told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
Amanpour asked about emails — originally published by “hacktivist” website dcleaks.com — showing Breedlove seeking help from former Secretary of State Colin Powell on ways to get Obama to be more aggressive in defending Ukraine against Russian invasion.
“I think POTUS sees us as a threat that must be minimized,” they wrote in a 2014 email, “ie do not get me into a war????”
Breedlove deflected Amanpour's questions at first, slamming the source of the leaks, which has not been publicly identified. “Let's talk about the frustration right up front — the frustration that a nation-state would hack into a private individual's emails and then use those to put out there for political or military gain in the diatribe,” they said. Breedlove had retired as Air Force general a day before they spoke to Amanpour, so they were hardly a private citizen when they were hacked.
Phillip Carter, a former Pentagon official who is now a director at the Center for a New American Security, tweeted in response to the Intercept article that Breedlove's dissent and backchannel lobbying “far exceeds what is appropriate for a US general.”
As we speak, wealthy wannabes with cash to burn are being subjected to the horrors of folding chairs and plain cheese sandwiches at Fyre Festival. Pitched as an upscale experience in the Bahamas full of yachts and hot models in bikinis, guests—who paid between $1,000 to $12,000 for tickets alone, and up to $250,000 for yacht packages—instead arrived to find the Spirit Airlines version of a music festival, with repurposed FEMA relief tents standing in for villas, attendees stranded at the airport, and, worst of all, no beer. As word began to spread of the economy-class conditions on Twitter and Reddit, Blink-182 dropped out, and organizers postponed the festival and offered refunds to guests who weren't able to physically make it to the island.
Now, festival co-organizer Ja Rule has issued a statement on Twitter (via Pitchfork), saying their immediate concern is getting festival-goers home safe, and that they “truly apologize(s) as this is NOT MY FAULT.” They go on to add that they don't know how things went to wrong, but insists that they and co-organizer/ entrepreneur Billy McFarland did not set out to defraud people, writing that Fyre Festival was “NOT A SCAM”:

The New York Post takes a more skeptical view, repeating a bit of hearsay that organizers told the A-list models and celebrities hired to promote the festival not to attend this weekend, but to wait until next weekend when “all the kinks are worked out.” It also confirms that Ja Rule did not arrive at the festival last night, as they were performing in Chicago, but that conflicting reports say McFarland was either partying on a yacht Thursday night or on the ground trying to help attendees.
The Trump campaign may have obsessed relentlessly over Hillary Clinton's email security, but the Trump administration keeps getting tricked by outsiders seeking to communicate with high-level officials.
On Monday, CNN reported that several White House officials including former communications director Anthony Scaramucci and Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert were tricked into corresponding with a UK-based, self-described "email prankster." This report comes just days after it was revealed that US Energy Secretary Rick Perry unwittingly spoke to Russian jokesters about energy policy.
I even emailed Scaramucci yesterday evening . That's THREE people I've made them believe I am. 'Communications Director'... yeah right! pic.twitter.com/TVOsUCosXX — EMAIL PRANKSTER (@SINON_REBORN) August 1, 2017
The anonymous prankster, known as @SINON_REBORN on Twitter, embarked on a prank campaign targeting White House officials at the end of July by imitating various people within the Trump administration. This wasn't the prankster's first major endeavor — they previously pretended to be Howard Stern and executives at Citibank and Goldman Sachs — but this one apparently came from a personal place.
I targeted @Scaramucci as i've suffered from mental health problems all my life, and they seem to think paranoid schizophrenia is a put down — EMAIL PRANKSTER (@SINON_REBORN) August 1, 2017
In the email chains reported on by CNN, @SINON_REBORN posed as Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman Jr., former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, among others. According to CNN, the prank emails targeted Scaramucci, Bossert, and Eric Trump. The general theme in @SINON_REBORN's emails seemed to be insulting some members of the administration and insinuating that others should be removed from their positions.
In one exchange from July 28, the prankster imitated Huntsman in an email to Scaramucci and joked about getting “rid of dumb and dumber, the Trump sons.” Scaramucci's response seemingly referencing their desire to see both Priebus and White House senior adviser Steve Bannon fired — CNN reported that the exchange took place before Priebus's termination was announced at the end of July.
An excerpt of what I emailed to @Scaramucci whilst playing the part of Jon Huntsman Jr. Apparently this didn't seem out of the ordinary?! pic.twitter.com/6INHJi3KCD — EMAIL PRANKSTER (@SINON_REBORN) August 1, 2017
CNN reported that the following exchange, in which @SINON_REBORN asked whose “head should roll first,” was an apparent reference to both Priebus and Bannon:
FAKE HUNTSMAN: Who's (sic) head should roll first? Maybe I can help things along somewhat. SCARAMUCCI: Both of them.
Days later, after Trump announced Priebus's resignation as chief of staff, @SINON_REBORN emailed Scaramucci pretending to be Priebus. The prankster wrote that Scaramucci hadn't “acted in a way that's even remotely classy,” but conceded that Preibus's replacement — Gen. John Kelly — would do a better job as chief of staff.
I think what I said to @Scaramucci when I was playing the part of @Reince was actually quite an accurate summary of their behaviour pic.twitter.com/9dPyNwYvUX — EMAIL PRANKSTER (@SINON_REBORN) July 31, 2017
Here's part of their exchange, as reported by CNN:
FAKE PRIEBUS: I had promised myself I would leave my hands mud free ... but after reading your tweet today which stated how; “soon we will learn who in the media who has class, and who hasn't,” has pushed me to this. That tweet was breathtakingly hypocritical, even for you. At no stage have you acted in a way that's even remotely classy, yet you believe that's the standard by which everyone should behave towards you? General Kelly will do a fine job. I'll even admit they will do a better job than me. But the way in which that transition has come about has been diabolical. And hurtful. I don't expect a reply. SCARAMUCCI: You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize. FAKE PRIEBUS: I can't believe you are questioning my ethics! The so called 'Mooch', who can't even manage their first week in the White House without leaving upset in their wake. I have nothing to apologize for. SCARAMUCCI: Read Shakespeare. Particularly Othello. You are right there. My family is fine by the way and will thrive. I know what you did. No more replies from me.
The prankster has since tweeted that they will no longer be targeting the White House. @SINON_REBORN wrote Monday, “I'm just a dude with a iPhone, you need to tighten up IT policy. love x x.”

"The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence," Donald Trump tweeted. | Getty Trump: 'Hamilton' cast harassed Pence
President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Saturday morning that Vice President-elect Mike Pence was "harassed" by the cast of "Hamilton," after an actor addressed Pence's presence and expressed concern about the incoming administration on stage after the musical's performance Friday evening.
"Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!" Trump tweeted.
Story Continued Below
"The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!" they followed up.
More than 10 hours later, after a day of meetings with potential Cabinet members, the president-elect took to Twitter again.
"Very rude and insulting of Hamilton cast member to treat our great future V.P. Mike Pence to a theater lecture. Couldn't even memorize lines!" Trump tweeted Saturday evening.

The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016
Pence, who attended the play with their daughter Charlotte and their nieces and nephew, was greeted with boos and cheers when they first walked into the theater. Following the performance, Broadway star Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, addressed Pence's presence.
"Vice President-elect Pence, I see you walking out, but I hope you hear us, just a few more moments," Dixon said as some of the audience members booed Pence. "There is nothing to boo here ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing to boo here. We are all here sharing a story of love. We have a message for you, sir, and we hope that you will hear us out."
Dixon said the cast welcomed Pence and thanked them for attending. They encouraged audience members to pull out their phones to record and to post on social media.
"We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir," Dixon said. "But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us."
Lin-Manuel Miranda, writer and former star of the musical, tweeted Saturday: "Proud of @HamiltonMusical. Proud of @BrandonVDixon, for leading with love. And proud to remind you that ALL are welcome at the theater."
Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, also responded to the cast's statement in a series of tweets Saturday morning.
"The arrogance and hostility of the Hamilton cast to the Vice President elect (a guest at the theater) is a reminder the left still fights," they wrote.
Gingrich tied the cast's action to Sen. Elizabeth Warren and The New York Times' and Washington Post's coverage of the election.
"Hamilton cast hostility, Warren comments on Trump nominees, Times and Post false coverage, all reminders this will be a permanent campaign" Gingrich wrote.
Dixon, who read the statement, responded to Trump's tweets.
"@realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen."
Panda Security researchers solved the mystery of the 32-character code in the inner gold ring of U.S. Cyber Command's logo.
A security researcher said on Thursday they were the first to crack the code embedded in the seal of the U.S. Cyber Command (Cybercom), the group responsible for protecting the country's military networks from attack.
Sean-Paul Correll, a threat researcher with antivirus vendor Panda Security, said that the characters visible in a gold ring on Cybercom's official seal represent the MD5 hash of the group's mission statement. MD5 is a 128-bit cryptographic hash most often used to verify file integrity.
A representative of Cybercom confirmed that Correll had it right. " Mr. Correll is correct...it's a MD5 hash," said Lt. Commander Steve Curry of the U.S. Navy, in an e-mail.
"It wasn't very difficult," said Correll, adding that thanks to the clue on Wired.com's Danger Room blog, it took them just a few minutes to figure out that the characters -- 9ec4c12949a4f31474f299058ce2b22a -- were the hash value for Cybercom's mission statement.
"I knew right away it was an MD5 hash, and I was fairly confident that it wasn't a specific file," said Correll, adding that security professionals will often use an MD5 hash as reminders, or to verify that a file's contents after downloading match the original edition.
Correll said they figured out the mystery shortly after 10 a.m. PT Wednesday, within an hour of Wired.com publishing its story.
At least one other code-breaker came up with the same solution. Buried in the nearly 500 comments added to the Wired.com story was the solution, posted Wednesday at 12:46 p.m. PT by someone identified only as "jemelehill".
In a follow-up story, Wired.com credited jemelehill with first decoding the message.
"Information security professionals are very challenge driven," said Correll, so tackling the problem was fun...while it lasted. "Absolutely, this was definitely fun," they said.
Correll is familiar with code-breaking problems, since Panda regularly sponsors secret code challenges. The next challenge is scheduled to go live at 3:00 a.m. ET Saturday, 12:00 a.m. PT.
The MD5 value is a hash of Cybercom's 58-word mission statement, Correll noted on their blog: "USCYBERCOM plans, coordinates, integrates, synchronizes and conducts activities to: direct the operations and defense of specified Department of Defense information networks and; prepare to, and when directed, conduct full spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains, ensure US/Allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries."
Cybercom was created in June 2009, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates approved the group. Two months ago, the Senate appointed Lt. Gen. Keith Alexander as the head Cybercom. Alexander is also the director of the National Security Agency (NSA).
U.S. Cyber Command is part of the U.S. Strategic Command, and is based in Fort Meade, MD. Several units of the U.S. military, including ones from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines comprise Cybercom.

\evil\ Terezi AU.
okay, here comes the drawing based on a dream I've had last night.
In there I was Karkat, desperately trying to protect Terezi from evil people hunting them because, as I-he thought, Terezi killed someone to protect themselves and that was the reason they were chasing after them
Lately in a dream we are hunted down by detective Vriska, who knows all the stuff and apparently is dressed in suit and has a hat on. Who, for some reason, asks me-Karkat for a word.
Detective Vriska tells Karkat the truth about Terezi, that they were behind all the murders that were committed lately (in whatever place I've been). Which I-Karkat don't quite believe at the beginning. Because it's Terezi. But then suddenly remember all the murders and Terezi's weird behaviour; the fact that I-he was only used by them and therefore does no not quite know if I-he should help Vriska to bring Terezi to justice or not.
Engineers from five F1 teams – including experts on stress analysis – are meeting with FIA safety expert Andy Mellor in London today to talk about how to integrate the Halo, and it is understood that the Red Bull idea will also feature in the discussions if there's time.
The idea features a combination of a "glass" material and carbon, as did a recent idea that emerged from Mercedes.
The key for the FIA is that the current Halo design has already gone through a lot of testing and there may not be time to complete that process.
"Obviously head protection is crucial," said Red Bull boss Christian Horner when asked by Motorsport.com.
"Red Bull is making another submission for a canopy that we believe will be a safer option. It's more of a canopy than a Halo.
"But it needs to be tested, which hopefully can be done very quickly.
"We have a committed a design study on evolving the FIA's theme, and we feel there's a viable solution."
Asked if it could be readied for 2017, they added: "Why not?"
American taxpayers in San Francisco are expected to soon pay up to $190,000 to an illegal alien who claimed the City's “sanctuary” policies did not protect him, despite their previous criminal history.
In December 2015, Pedro Figueroa-Zarceno, an illegal alien from El Salvador, had their car stolen and subsequently went to the local police station to recover the vehicle. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were contacted, as police were made aware that Figueroa-Zarceno was an illegal alien, according to CBS News.
Figueroa-Zarceno was ordered to be deported back in 2005, but they have defied the order. In 2012, the illegal alien was convicted and imprisoned for drunk driving.
While Figueroa-Zarceno was taken into custody by ICE, they and their lawyers said their detention violated San Francisco's controversial sanctuary city laws, which mandates that illegal aliens, no matter their criminal history, be shielded from immigration law enforcement.
The illegal alien was detained by ICE for two months, but their attorneys are now expected to win them $190,000 settlement, which taxpayers will foot the bill.
According to Figueroa-Zarceno's attorneys, the San Francisco Police Department violated sanctuary city laws by allegedly cooperating with ICE to inform them of the illegal alien's status and past run-ins with the law.
The San Francisco Police Department is advocating for the settlement with the illegal alien.
“San Francisco has strong policies in place to encourage victims and witnesses to report crimes without fear of being deported, which include our sanctuary ordinance,” San Francisco City Attorney spokesperson John Coté said. “These policies are designed to foster respect and trust between law enforcement and residents to ensure our communities are safe. The City, including the Police Department, remain committed to them.”
“This proposed settlement is a fair resolution for all of the parties involved,” Coté said.

Small town newspaper photography can be a thankless task, a never-ending parade of firefighter photo ops, the occasional crime scene, and, yes, parades. But Bruce Bishop, the photo chief at Elyria, Ohio's Chronicle-Telegram, brought their A-game when tasked with providing art for a story on what the paper says is a “real whodunit”: the mysterious placement of steak-sauce bottles throughout the Avon Lake Public Library.
‘The mystery of the A-1 bottles': Not a new title, but a real whodunit at the Avon Lake LIbrary https://t.co/IqtyaAid7a by @BradDickenCT pic.twitter.com/USdGWdMELG — Chronicle-Telegram (@YourChronicle) March 10, 2017
Bishop could've taken that photo anywhere in the library; only a pro chooses to stage it with the library's mysteries section subtly showing in the background. But a great story calls for great art, and the Chronicle-Telegram was on to a great story.
Someone, the paper reported Friday, has been hiding A-1 bottles on bookshelves since January. Twenty-eight of the bottles had appeared, providing the library's staff with a small collection and an enduring riddle.
No culprit has been found, despite the efforts of library staff, who told the Chronicle-Telegram they even drew up a map—like detectives hunting a serial killer—to see if any patterns emerged.
No patterns did, though the non-fiction section, the paper reported, appeared to be the most popular hiding spot.
On Tuesday, a library spokesperson told Atlas Obscura that two more bottles had been found since the Chronicle-Telegram's story, but, despite the publicity, there had been no more new clues uncovered, “nor a culprit.”
For now, then, the mystery lives on, though if you have any theories, the library is interested in hearing about them.

Mexican man executed in Texas for killing a police officer is given a hero's burial in their home town
Thousands line streets of Mexican city for burial of Edgar Tamayo
They were executed by lethal injection last month for killing a police officer
Their lawyers say they didn't receive a fair trial
Edgar Tamayo was convicted of the January 3, 1994 shooting death of Houston police officer Guy Gaddis and and was executed last month in Texas
Thousands of mourners poured out to see the burial of the Mexican man put to death by lethal injection in Texas last month, a move that has sparked diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and the central American state.
Friends and relatives carried the coffin of Mexican Edgar Tamayo to the cemetery in their home town of Miacatlan, Morelos state, amid an outpouring of grief from local residents.
The 46-year-old Mexican was controversially executed in Texas less than two weeks ago for the killing of a Houston police officer in 1994, despite outrage from human rights groups and last minute appeals from their lawyers for clemency on the grounds that Tamayo was mentally disabled.
The case saw the unusual intervention of the U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, who had repeatedly urged the Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott to delay Tamayo's punishment, saying it 'could impact the way American citizens are treated in other countries.'
Abbott and the Harris County district attorney opposed postponing what was the first execution this year in the ultra-conservative American state. Some 16 people were executed in Texas in 2013.
The Mexican government also sharply criticized the decision, saying failure to review Tamayo's case and reconsider their sentence would be 'a clear violation by the United States of its international obligations'.
Tamayo was found guilty of shooting 24-year-old Houston police officer Guy Gaddis 20 years ago.
Tamayo's lawyers, the Mexican government and rights groups all say Tamayo was denied a fair trial because they failed to receive consular help, something which they say broke international law and could have helped them avoid the death sentence.

Officials are evaluating different options for operating the Cincinnati streetcar system.
The original proposal called for service to start at 6 a.m. and end at 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and midnight on Friday and Saturday.
Cincinnati and Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) representatives are now considering options that would have the streetcar start later in the morning and run longer into the evening.
Original proposed schedule:
Sunday-Thursday 6 a.m. - 10 p.m.
Friday-Saturday 6 a.m. - 12 a.m.
Streetcar running every 15 minutes off peak.
Every 12 minutes peak Monday-Friday 10 a.m. - 9 p.m.
Alternate schedule #1:
Sunday 9 a.m. - 11:30 p.m.
Monday-Wednesday 7:30 a.m. - 11:30 p.m.
Thursday 7:30 a.m. - 1 a.m.
Friday 7:30 a.m. - 2 a.m.
Saturday 9 a.m. - 2 a.m.
Streetcar running every 15 minutes off peak.
Every 12 minutes peak Monday-Friday 10 a.m. - 9 p.m.
Alternate schedule #2:
Sunday 9 a.m. - 12 a.m.
Monday-Thursday 7 a.m. - 12 a.m.
Friday 7 a.m. - 2 a.m.
Saturday 9 a.m. - 2 a.m.
Streetcar running every 15 minutes off peak.
Every 12 minutes peak Monday-Friday 11:30 a.m. - 6:30 p.m.
Cincinnati Council and SORTA will likely vote early next year on the operating hours for the city's new streetcar system.
1942: British physicist Stephen Hawking is born.
Hawking was born in Oxford, where their parents moved to escape the German Blitz on London. In an interesting historical aside, their birth came on the 300th anniversary of Galileo's death.
Though naturally predisposed to mathematics, young Hawking switched to physics, because University College at Oxford did not offer the discipline. They turned out to be pretty good at physics, too. From there, Hawking moved on to Cambridge to do their research in cosmology.
It was while attending Cambridge that they developed the first signs of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the incurable neurological disease. The average ALS patient dies within a few years of diagnosis. Defying all odds, Hawking has managed to live with it for nearly five decades.
In fact, Hawking has done far more than simply "live with ALS." Almost willfully ignoring their disability, which leaves them paralyzed and unable to speak or walk, Hawking has carved out a brilliant career as a theoretical physicist specializing in the study of the universe.
Their best-seller on the subject, A Brief History of Time, helped raise public consciousness regarding the nature of the universe, its possible beginnings and its probable end.
The very slow progression of Hawking's disease remains a mystery. A special computer rigged to their wheelchair and operated by a "blink switch" attached to their glasses gives them a limited self-sufficiency, although they still require around-the-clock nursing care.
In April 2007, Hawking realized their dream of taking a zero-gravity flight, making them the first quadriplegic ever to do so.

UPDATE - Feb. 1, 2014, 6:20 p.m. ET: Anuj Nayar, PayPal's senior director of global initiatives, told Mashable, "For a brief period today, a very limited number of people visiting certain PayPal and eBay marketing pages in the UK, France and India were redirected. The issue was quickly detected and resolved. No customer data was accessed by these redirects, and no customer accounts were affected. We take the security and privacy of our customers very seriously and are actively investigating the reasons behind the temporary redirects."
The Syrian Electronic Army, a notorious hacking group, says it claimed two big-name victims Saturday: eBay and PayPal.
While a hack on PayPal could put millions of peoples' bank information at risk, the hackers said this attack was a "hacktivist operation," and that they did not target account information. Instead, the SEA claimed it was able to replace the homepages of eBay and PayPal in France, Israel and the UK with its own logo.

"We didn't do it to hack people accounts," SEA member Th3 Pr0 told Mashable. Th3 Pr0 said the SEA compromised eBay's domains manager, which allowed the hackers to shut down the website or redirect it another server. Th3 Pr0 added that the SEA was able to display its logo on various eBay and PayPal homepages for about 30 minutes.
The ecommerce companies, which are jointly owned, haven't confirmed the attack, but the SEA has provided the following screenshots to prove that it occurred. The images appear to show control panels for eBay and PayPal in France, which are operated through MarkMonitor, an online brand-protection company.

A spokesperson for MarkMonitor told Mashable that the company "takes security very seriously", and it does not comment on clients, including whether or not a particular company is a MarkMonitor client.
The SEA has become known for high-profile attacks — mostly on western media companies — performed through phishing, or fraudulent emails used to trick the company's employees into providing sensitive login information. Although Th3 Pr0 refused to disclose exactly how the alleged attack took place, the hacker suggested that the SEA used more forceful tactics than usual.
"PayPal used a large amount of authentication and verification protocols, so the attack required a lot more advanced techniques," Th3 Pr0 said.
The SEA said the attack was in retaliation for PayPal and eBay's lack of presence in Syria. Description pages for both sites — eBay and PayPal — do not include Syria on their respective lists of countries where the services are available.
If your Paypal account is down for a few minutes, think about Syrians who were denied online payments for more than 3 years. #SEA — SyrianElectronicArmy (@Official_SEA16) February 1, 2014

Essendon captain Jobe Watson has been worn down by the ongoing anti-doping investigation at Essendon
RECENTLY departed Essendon coach Mark Thompson would not be surprised if Bombers captain Jobe Watson doesn't play AFL football again.
Thompson worked closely with Watson at Essendon from 2011-14, in the first three years as a senior assistant to coach James Hird and last year as stand-in coach while Hird served a 12-month suspension for their part in the Bombers' 2011-12 supplements program.
The two-time Geelong premiership coach said Watson had been so worn down by the two-and-a-half-year supplements saga that they could decide to retire.
"This has whacked them right in the gob and it wouldn't surprise me if they just said, 'Yeah, I've had enough'. It wouldn't surprise me at all," Thompson told radio station 3AW.
"He's been the spokesperson for the player group and the length of time (the saga has dragged on for), I think, has just got to him.
"If there's no end, if it just keeps going, I don't think anyone would want to be involved in that."
Thompson's comments follow Watson's admission on Friday night that they had lost their enjoyment of football this season before undergoing season-ending shoulder surgery following the Bombers' round 14 loss to St Kilda.
The Dons skipper told Channel Seven that WADA's decision in May to appeal the AFL Anti-Doping Tribunal decision clearing 34 past and present Essendon players of anti-doping offences had weighed heavily on him.
"I had some moments where I wasn't enjoying playing," Watson said.
"I guess it stems back to what happened at the start of the year and given what we've gone through I think we deserved to move on.
"It's very difficult to have closure on anything until it's behind (us) and unfortunately it's not."
Watson said their shoulder injury had come at an opportune time.
"I think I needed some breathing air," they said.
"I wasn't sure what I was going to do, where I was heading."
Thompson said they saw Watson's passion for training and playing wane at times last year as the supplements saga dragged on, and believed the captain "could not even contemplate enjoying football" until the case was finalised.
WADA's appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport could now drag on into 2016 as the world anti-doping body seeks a stay of proceedings until sports scientist Stephen Dank announces whether they will appeal an AFL lifetime ban.
Dank has until Monday, July 20, to declare whether they will appeal.
An infant diet that includes fish before the age of 9 months curbs the risk of developing eczema, indicates research published ahead of print in the Archives of Disease in Childhood.
The prevalence of atopic eczema and other allergic disease has risen sharply in developed countries in recent decades, say the authors. Environmental and dietary factors are thought to play a part.
The researchers quizzed the parents of 6 month old babies born in western Sweden in 2003 about their child's diet and any evidence of allergic eczema. They were quizzed again when the children reached the age of 12 months.
The children were all part of an ongoing health study, Infants of Western Sweden, which is tracking the long term health of almost 17000 babies.
Complete birth data and two sets of questionnaires were obtained for almost 5000 of the 8000 families contacted.
At six months, 13% of families said that their youngest child had already developed eczema. By the time the children had reached 12 months of age, one in five had the condition.
The average age at which first symptoms appeared was 4 months.
Genes had a significant impact. Children with a sibling or mother who had the condition were almost twice as likely to be affected by the age of 12 months.
But breastfeeding, the age at which dairy products were introduced into the diet, and keeping a furry pet in the house had no impact on risk. Around one in five households had a pet.
However, the introduction of fish into the diet before the age of 9 months cut the risk of developing the disease by 25%. And a pet bird was also associated with a significant reduction in risk.

Gardeners are being encouraged to bowl snails out of their back yards to stop them munching on their prized plants.
New research suggests that if you remove them some 65-feet away from your garden - around the same length as a cricket pitch - they will not return.
Chemical pellets are often used to combat the pesky mollusks but this new method could be just as effective.
The humble garden snail is one of the most common sights of the British countryside but how much do you actually know about them?
Walk - or slide - this way.
Old heads
A snail's lifespan is dependant on what exact species they are and what habitat they live in.
Some only live for 5 years but can if lucky enough can live to as long as 25.
Best foot forward
While it may not look like it snails slide around on a single foot.
The one long muscle acts just like a human extremity and helps them grip and push themselves along the ground.
Are they poisonous?

Marine species of snail are poisonous but most of the land-based examples are not.
If you are sick after eating them it's almost certainly because they weren't cooked properly.
The sea-based cone snail is one of the most deadly creatures in the world with a single sting even able to cause death.
Life in the fast-ish lane
The slime - which is in fact mucus - helps lubricate the floor and helps them pass along with less friction.
With this being the case snails often travel in the mucus trails of others to move faster.

Despite their speedy slime lanes rather unsurprisingly snails are one of the slowest creatures on the planet.
They usually move at a steady pace but can reach a dizzying 50 yards per hour - 1.3cm per second.
You can eat the slime
Yes you read that correctly - you can eat the slimy trail left behind.
A popularly peddled myth is that snail slime makes a food inedible but a simple wash and it should be good to go.
Remarkably some research suggests it can be used to treat stomach ulcers.

Snails are almost completely blind and they don't have any mechanism of hearing sounds either.
With the kind of sensory deprivation their sense of smell is extraordinary.
They can apparently locate food from as far away as a few metres, which for an animal of their minuscule dimensions is quite the distance.
Sky-high dentist bills
You might not think so to look at them but snails actually do have teeth.
In fact the average garden snail has over 14,000 of them - a costly scale and polish for sure.

Officials in Florida have called in a bizarre method to cause the growing problem of giant snails - using Labrador retrievers.
As many as 128,000 snails were caught as part of an aggressive extermination campaign but more help was needed which saw canines called in.
"They're very good at detecting the Giant African Land Snail," said Richard Gaskalla, the head of plant industry at the Florida Agriculture Department.
"So we're building four-legged technology into this program as quickly as we can."
I was shocked the other day to hear that Mark Levin had responded on the air to my prior post in which I offered helpful hints on how to tell true conservatives from pseudo-cons like Levin.
The reason I was shocked is that I found out that there are still people out there who consider Levin to be a conservative.
Who knew? I had always assumed that everyone knew this guy had long ago revealed themselves as a liberty-hating left-winger, as you can see from their remarks about Ron Paul in the above video.
Check at the 1:30 mark where they tell the Ron Paul supporter "You're the ones who don't understand the Constitution. You're the ones who misread the Constitution."
Now this is odd behavior, even for a "neo" conservative like Levin.
Everyone who knows anything about the Texas Congressman knows that of all the members of both houses of Congress, Ron has the voting record that is most in tune with the Constitution.
Paul, who is a medical doctor, has acquired the nickname "Doctor No" precisely because they regularly record the sole vote against any of a number of measures that gain otherwise unanimous support. They do so because they are a strict believer in the limited powers of the federal government imposed by the Constitution and will not vote to expand those powers.
Levin, by comparison, has built their career on posing as a believer in a strict interpretation of the Constitution. Yet when confronted with the emergence in the 2008 presidential race of a true adherent to strict constitutional interpretation, their knee-jerk reaction was to denounce Paul.
Why is anybody's guess, but I imagine it was because the presence of Paul on the scene unmasked Levin and the rest of the neoconservatives as imposters.
I realize that most people are incapable of telling the difference between a true conservative like me and a poser like Levin.
Here's one hint: The minute I heard Paul was running for president I endorsed him. Any conservative would have. No presidential candidate since Barry Goldwater has represented such a faithful adherence to conservative philosophy in America.
So I got a good laugh when the radio Republicans like Levin and Sean Hannity flew into a rage at the mere mention of Ron's name.
That's the key to understanding why these guys are not real conservatives. Note in the above clip when Levin says "the founders were not libertarians."
What founders is they talking about? Certainly not John Adams, who said "The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty."
Certainly not Sam Adams, who said, "Driven from every other corner of the earth, freedom of thought and the right of private judgment in matters of conscience, direct their course to this happy country as their last asylum."
Certainly not Thomas Jefferson, who said ....
But why bother? I could provide a hundred quotes to the effect that the founders were, above all, libertarians. The Constitution they wrote consists of one restriction after another on the powers of the federal government and of the majority. And no one shows more fealty to that document than Ron Paul.
The big lie of the neocons is that American conservatism is no longer inherently libertarian. It was throughout history, until the neocons took over. As late as 1964, we had a libertarian running for president as a Republican, Barry Goldwater. That was also the year that the liberty-loving member of congress Howard Buffett died, and was called an "ultra-conservative" in their obituary precisely because they held the same small-government views Paul now espouses.
Those views were not compatible with the neocon idea that the Beltway crowd should use American taxpayer dollars to extend the American welfare state to Iraq. That's why these guys hated Ron Paul.
But that's not the worst part of this clip. Note at the end where Levin calls Ron Paul "RuPaul."
Are they so sophomoric that they think this is witty? For this to be witty, there would have to be some underlying joke, i.e. if Ron Paul was a large African-American transvestite running for president, it might be funny to call them "RuPaul." But he's not. And it's not the least bit funny, any more than Levin's "laugh" lines about "The New York Slimes" and "The Washington Compost."
Levin owes Ron Paul an apology. They should be a man and admit they were wrong and Ron was right.
So if you like Levin, do them a favor. Call them up and tell them you want to hear them admit they were wrong about "RuPaul." Tell them that if they want to claim to be a conservative, it's time for them to make a public apology to the single most prominent proponent of the Constitution in America, as Glenn Beck did. Here's an excerpt:
Beck would like the time machine to take them back eighteen months. Why? To go back to when they were calling Ron Paul a "crackpot on so many issues." Now, they lament, "Gosh. I'd like to reexamine all those issues."
Until Levin re-examines how wrong they were on Ron Paul, just tune them out and listen to Michael Savage on WOR in that time frame. Both these guys are essentially entertainers. And Mike is a lot more entertaining - and a lot less irritating.
ALSO NOTE: The Southern Avenger's take on Glenn Beck's apology to Ron Paul.
COMMENTS: I'm getting a bit tired of comments from people who claim not to understand the difference between true or "paleo" conservatives such as Ron Paul an the fake "neo" conservatives. Here is a site that gives a good rundown on real conservatism. Read some of the links and familiarize yourself with the nature of real vs. neo conservatism before commenting. This is mandatory reading. Do not comment until having done the assignment, boys and girls.
Next time you bite into an organic, sourdough loaf or sip a shiraz from a tiny vineyard, spare a guilty thought for Australia's flagging productivity.
The Productivity Commission has fingered bakers of “artisan products” and “international style breads . . . with healthy additives such as whole grains” as a small but noteworthy drag on our economic efficiency.
It takes twice as many bakers to bake these loaves as it does to bake a fluffy white sliced. But the statistician doesn't feel the consumers' pleasure, “given the challenges of measuring changes in quality”. “Bakery product manufacturing is likely to have contributed to lower measures (or productivity),” the commission says.
John Dench, whose eponymous bakery has its a store in toney North Fitzroy, is nonplussed. “I don't now what percentage artisan bakers make [of] bread production in Australia. I wouldn't think it's a huge amount because the fluffy white brigade are doing their best to give us a $1 loaf.”
Small winemakers are in the commission's sights too, for ignoring falling demand and sticking with the vines. “Lifestyle considerations, tax arrangements, and alternative sources of income may have reduced the incentive for small wine-makers to leave the industry.”
Winemakers' Federation chief executive Paul Evans , doesn't disagree. But they say many small winemakers are genuine, long-term players and care should be taken in changing the rules.

Former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, center, pleaded guilty last week to lying to the FBI about their pre-inauguration contacts with senior Russian officials. | Susan Walsh/AP Flynn texted partners about nuclear plan during inauguration, whistleblower says House Democrats say the whistleblower approached them in June, but Mueller asked them to not make the information public until now.
Congressional Democrats said Wednesday they have evidence from a confidential whistleblower that within minutes of President Donald Trump's inauguration, then-national security adviser Michael Flynn sent assurances to former business partners that a plan to build nuclear reactors across the Middle East was "good to go."
Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a letter dated Wednesday that the whistleblower reported attending an Inauguration Day event with Flynn's former business associate Alex Copson, the managing partner of ACU Strategic Partners.
Story Continued Below
The whistleblower said Copson gushed that Trump's inauguration was "the best day of my life" because it meant their company's effort to create a U.S.-Russia energy partnership in the Middle East, which reportedly would have included more than two dozen nuclear plants in the region, was moving forward. Copson said Flynn was making sure Obama-era sanctions, which they claimed threatened the nuclear project, would be "ripped up," according to the whistleblower.
And the whistleblower said Copson flipped their phone around to reveal a text message they said came from Flynn describing the nuclear reactor project as "good to go." According to the account, the whistleblower didn't see the substance of the text but recalled seeing a 12:11 p.m. time stamp. At that time, Flynn was on the dais during Trump's inaugural address.
"Our committee has credible allegations that President Trump's National Security Advisor sought to manipulate the course of international nuclear policy for the financial gain of their former business partners," Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said in the letter to Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.). "These grave allegations compel a full, credible, and bipartisan congressional investigation."

Neither Flynn's attorney nor Copson immediately responded to requests for comment on Wednesday. Scrutiny of the nuclear plan has risen since congressional Democrats said Flynn did not disclose related trips to the Middle East when they filed their security clearance renewal application in 2016.
Flynn pleaded guilty last week to lying to the FBI about their pre-inauguration contacts with senior Russian officials, and they said they were cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether Trump associates colluded with Russians to influence the 2016 election. Flynn could also be a crucial witness in an investigation into whether Trump intended to obstruct the Russia investigation by firing former FBI Director James Comey.
Cummings said the whistleblower approached the committee in June, but Mueller's investigators asked the Maryland Democrat to hold off on the public release of this information “until they completed certain investigative steps.”
“They have now informed us that they have done so,” Cummings told Gowdy, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House also did not respond.
Multiple news reports described emails and accounts revealing boastfulness by Flynn's former partners about their nuclear plan, as well as Flynn's efforts inside the White House to promote the deal.
"This is the start of something I have been working on for years," the whistleblower recalled Copson saying at the Inauguration Day event, according to the Democrats' letter. "Mike has been putting everything in place for us."
Cummings described the whistleblower as "authentic, credible, and reliable." They also said the whistleblower "still fears retaliation" but felt "duty bound as a citizen to make this disclosure." The whistleblower, Cummings added, has expressed willingness to meet with Gowdy if the chairperson agrees to keep the individual's identity confidential.
Gowdy responded sharply in a letter to Cummings, refusing the offer and referring it instead to the House intelligence committee, which is leading an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
"While you may want every committee of Congress to investigate the same fact patterns," Gowdy wrote, "it isn't a prudent use of resources — something you used to be mindful of."
They also suggested that Cummings redirect any information they have to Mueller, though Cummings said he's already shared the information with the special counsel's team.
Cummings has complained for months that Gowdy won't subpoena the White House for more details about Flynn's conduct during their brief tenure as Trump's national security adviser. Flynn resigned just 24 days after Trump's inauguration because they purportedly misled Vice President Mike Pence about their conversations with Russian officials in the weeks leading up to the inauguration.
Gowdy has previously declined Cummings' call to subpoena the White House for Flynn records on the grounds that it could conflict with Mueller's probe.
"Much of what is sought by my Democratic colleagues — if properly investigated, charged and proven beyond a reasonable doubt — would carry criminal penalties," Gowdy wrote in an Oct. 18 letter to Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. "Congress does not, and cannot, prosecute crimes."
But Cummings used the new information to suggest that Gowdy should drop their objections. They noted that they and Gowdy's predecessor, former Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, worked together to procure documents indicating that Flynn had omitted key information about foreign contacts on their security clearance forms.
Cummings also argued that Gowdy seemed unconcerned with conflicting with ongoing investigations when the two men led the House investigation into the attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi — a probe that resulted in the discovery of Hillary Clinton's private email server. Cummings released an 11-page memo Wednesday detailing instances when Congress, and Gowdy himself, pursued investigations that ran parallel with separate criminal probes.
Gowdy rejected the suggestion they had reversed their position on parallel probes in their letter.
"Perhaps your memory is poor because you spent two years obstructing, delaying, and obfuscating the investigation," Gowdy wrote. "If it had been up to you, the server would still be a mystery."
A disease-fighting protein in our teardrops has been tethered to a tiny transistor, enabling UC Irvine scientists to discover exactly how it destroys dangerous bacteria. The research could prove critical to long-term work aimed at diagnosing cancers and other illnesses in their very early stages.
Ever since Nobel laureate Alexander Fleming found that human tears contain antiseptic proteins called lysozymes about a century ago, scientists have tried to solve the mystery of how they could relentlessly wipe out far larger bacteria. It turns out that lysozymes have jaws that latch on and chomp through rows of cell walls like someone hungrily devouring an ear of corn, according to findings that will be published Jan. 20 in the journal Science.
"Those jaws chew apart the walls of the bacteria that are trying to get into your eyes and infect them," said molecular biologist and chemistry professor Gregory Weiss, who co-led the project with associate professor of physics & astronomy Philip Collins.
The researchers decoded the protein's behavior by building one of the world's smallest transistors -- 25 times smaller than similar circuitry in laptop computers or smartphones. Individual lysozymes were glued to the live wire, and their eating activities were monitored.
"Our circuits are molecule-sized microphones," Collins said. "It's just like a stethoscope listening to your heart, except we're listening to a single molecule of protein."
It took years for the UCI scientists to assemble the transistor and attach single-molecule teardrop proteins. The scientists hope the same novel technology can be used to detect cancerous molecules. It could take a decade to figure out but would be well worth it, said Weiss, who lost their father to lung cancer.
"If we can detect single molecules associated with cancer, then that means we'd be able to detect it very, very early," Weiss said. "That would be very exciting, because we know that if we treat cancer early, it will be much more successful, patients will be cured much faster, and costs will be much less."
The project was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and the National Science Foundation. Co-authors of the Science paper are Yongki Choi, Issa Moody, Patrick Sims, Steven Hunt, Brad Corso and Israel Perez.
Two-alarm fire damages 12 units at condominium complex in northwest Columbus Copyright by WCMH - All rights reserved (Courtesy: Josh Swan) [ + - ] Video
COLUMBUS (WCMH) -- Firefighters pulled two alarms while battling a fire at a condominium complex in northwest Columbus.
It happened around 1:15pm Tuesday at the Dublin Green Condominiums located in the 2300 block of Vicente Court.
Firefighters on scene tell NBC4 there is extensive fire damage to the building's third floor, and water damage on the lower floors.
The roof started caving in while firefighters were battling the blaze. In all, 12 units were damaged as a result of the fire.

The Red Cross is on scene to assist those impacted by the fire. Residents that are displaced will be allowed to stay at the club house site for now.
There were no injuries. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.
Columbus, Worthington and Washington Township firefighters all responded to the scene.
An Ottawa-based think tank, with ties to corporate Canada and the federal government, is spearheading a campaign to persuade Canadians to embrace a free-trade deal with China.
As Canada's negotiators ready for a third round of exploratory trade talks with China, the Public Policy Forum (PPF) is embarking on a two-year effort, bankrolled by major corporations, to change Canadians' minds about bilateral trade with the world's second-biggest economy.
Public-opinion surveys, conducted in April by Nanos Research for The Globe and Mail, found nearly nine in 10 Canadians are "uncomfortable" with the idea of China's large, government-controlled businesses gaining more access to Canada's economy – an almost inevitable aspect of any free-trade deal. The poll also found that 66 per cent of respondents wants Ottawa to link human rights to trade talks.

The first quarterly meeting of the PPF'S Consultative Forum on China takes place in Ottawa on Wednesday and includes executives doing business with China, leading pro-free-trade advocates from academia as well as the head of the Canada China Business Council. Ian Shugart, deputy minister of Foreign Affairs, will address the gathering. Two high-ranking federal civil servants sit on the board of the PPF, an organization that advocates policies to promote good governance.
The conference is closed to the media. Edward Greenspon, a former editor-in-chief of The Globe, was in a "flurry of meetings" and unable to comment, according to spokesperson Carl Neustaedter.
"The discussion might be a bit different if there were media in the room, but that doesn't mean at some point there wouldn't be," Mr. Neustaedter said. "But I think the group will probably talk about how will its findings and discussions be communicated."
Even before it opened exploratory talks on a free-trade deal with Beijing, the Trudeau government had expressed concern in briefing notes, prepared by the department of Global Affairs last year, that Canadians are "ill-informed and negatively biased" in their understanding of China.
The PPF, which recently completed a federally commissioned report on the state of the media, laid out its plans for China in a background paper about the need to "write a more sophisticated narrative for Canadians" to catch up with Australia and New Zealand, which have signed free-trade agreements with Beijing.
"They have forged ahead with free-trade agreements and secured competitive advantages for their economies, universities and workers. Now, Canada is looking at following their path," the PPF paper said.

"As part of any effort the Canadian government must gain a firm grip on Canadian views toward China. Any [free-trade] agreement with China will require a broad social and political consensus built on a solid foundation of support from different quarters."
Mr. Neustaedter said the forum wasn't trying to shape public opinion in favour of free trade with Beijing, but rather was seeking ways to engage with China on areas as diverse as the training of judges and the environment.
"I wouldn't characterize it as everybody is for pro-free trade," they said. "It is really about a wide engagement, a more nuanced engagement [rather than] simply pro or con, or human rights versus trade kind of thing."
All of the people on Wednesday's speakers' list are known to be supporters of greater economic ties with China.
But Conservative MP Tony Clement said Canadians should be skeptical of the PPF's efforts on behalf of Canada's business establishment and the federal government.
"This organization is corporate Canada plus the Liberal Party in another guise," Mr. Clement said. "They have a corporate and political agenda to have free trade with China, almost at any cost. I fear if they get their way, any complaints we have about human rights would be tucked under the carpet."

The "prime" audience for the initiative is "the roughly half of Canadians who have not made up their minds and are open to weighing the arguments," the background PPF paper said, while noting the challenges of overcoming Canadian apprehension about China. "For Canada to muster persuasive arguments at home in an age where elites do not enjoy a monopoly means facing up squarely to the obstacles to a full flowered relationship while working to mitigate them."
Among the companies funding the China effort are Teck Resources, Bank of Montreal, Manulife, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Canadian National, Ernst & Young, TimberWest and Canpotex.
The PPF background paper cited a number of surveys that suggest Canadians are open to free trade.
One of them was an Abacus Research survey conducted in 2016 that showed 46 per cent of Canadians said they could be persuaded to support a closer relationship with China. The poll was paid for by Teck Resources, a Vancouver-based mining company with significant investment from a Chinese sovereign wealth fund that answers to the Communist government. A wholly owned subsidiary of China Investment Corp. owns 17.8 per cent of Teck's Class B shares and has control over 7.5 per cent of shareholder votes. A member of the National People's Congress of China, Quan Chong, sits on the Teck board of directors.
Other polls cited were conducted for the Asia Pacific Foundation, which has published articles in favour of free trade with China.
China's new envoy to Canada Lu Shaye has called on Canada's corporate elite to "actively introduce and explain to the Canadian public" the benefits to the country of signing a free-trade deal.

In speeches to business groups, Mr. Lu has expressed concern about negative Canadian public opinion and media editorials about opening up the Canadian economy to China, especially state-owned enterprises that often act in the interests of Beijing and are known to steal high technology.

There has been a big craze about Korean Skincare and some of the things they use on their skin I haven't even heard of, the main one being essence so I did a little digging and found out more about it.
At first I thought essence was the same as a toner but apparently not it's the skincare step after that, to balance your skins PH after stripping off all your natural oils when cleansing and toning giving you an instant shot of moisture.
I always thought of essence as a very watery formula but apparently, that's not the case. It can be an array of textures but I found that the thinner the texture the quicker it absorbs.
Essence is supposed to be a primer for the skin to better absorb the next steps in your skincare routine, it also targets wrinkles, fine lines, dull uneven skin and gives you an instant shot of moisture.
So how do you use essence? Well not with a cotton pad as it usually just soaks up all the product. The best way is to apply it is to put it on your palms then gently press the essence into your face, try not to be too ruff or pull at your skin.
Now for the big question DO YOU NEED ESSENCE? And my answer is … depends on your lifestyle, if you really don't want to have an extra step in your skincare routine then you will probably never end up using it but from my personal experience of trying it out for a couple of days is that it fits in surprisingly well with my routine, it gives me a much-needed shot of moisture when I need it most and I do believe it's helping my uneven skin tone, I have combination skin so I was fearful that it would be too much for my oily tee zone but I found that it has helped reduce it rather than made it worse.
So in my opinion, if you can be bothered to add another step in between toner and serum or moisturiser then id highly recommend giving it a try!
Do you use Essence? If so please tell me your experience in the comments below and don't forget to subscribe. Thanks for reading Xxx

Block of Granite
You have, will, and always will be getting your head and neck area targeted if you're in a combat or contact sport. Contact sports such as lacrosse, rugby, or football also feature violent clashes of the human body. In BJJ and submission grappling, you literally get your neck squeezed by your opponent in order to solicit a tap to pain or because you are about to lose consciousness from lack of blood flow to the brain.
Yet so little emphasis is placed on developing the musculature and mobility of the neck. This is a must-have tool for every grapplers' arsenal.
I'm going to get right to it and show you a few movements to use to develop your own neck program.
Neck Movements
To simplify things, I'll show you exercises from four groups:
External resistance : Resistance Bands – resistance bands provide a lot of versatility and flexibility. You can increase or reduce the amount of resistance during an actual set to get your target contraction right. Ross Enamait covers resistance bands extensively on their site and in their clips.
– resistance bands provide a lot of versatility and flexibility. You can increase or reduce the amount of resistance during an actual set to get your target contraction right. Ross Enamait covers resistance bands extensively on their site and in their clips. Weights – the traditional neck harness has been used for years to develop neck strength. While a valuable tool to overload the rear flexion of the neck, it also provides a static contraction for two main “shock absorbers” of the neck, the sternal head. From a cost/benefit perspective, if your on a budget, choose the resistance bands over the neck harness (Note that isometrics are free!)

From a cost/benefit perspective, if your on a budget, choose the resistance bands over the neck harness (Note that isometrics are free!) Workout Partner – using weights, resistance bands, or their own resistance, a workout partner can help you train your neck. The primary method of training the neck with a partner is drilling or live sparring/rolling. Many of your takedowns, escapes, and submissions leverage your head positioning in order to finish, making this a great option for training.
Bridge work : Wrestlers/Grapplers warm up typically included some type of front, side, and back bridging. Bridge work is very demanding on your body, especially with a weak neck. It also works your body as a unit, meaning you move your neck along the primary movement patterns (flexion, extension and rotation) while grappling which makes it highly functional. Isometrics Isometric contractions can be held for quick bursts to develop neck musculature (e.g., 5 seconds) or longer bouts for neck strength endurance (e.g., 30 seconds or more). You will be resisting the force place on your head to move your neck, which is exactly what you face while grappling. Plus you can use various methods of resistance (your head, a towel, resistance bands, an object like a wall or chair) to be creative.
You can also perform variations of headstands which will be, basically, putting weight on your head so your neck has to abosrb the weight. This forces an isometric contraction of the neck that is hard to duplicate. This also places alot of weight on your neck so if you have pain or disc issues to begin with, this may not be for you. Neck Mobility drills When you start moving your body around the mats in grappling movements, where your neck becomes part of the movement, we will classify that as a neck mobility drill). It's a natural progression from the movement patterns of bridge work and the strength development work with external resistance. Examples I like include the Bridge with Kick Over and the Head Post Bridge Pass Drill (both of which I demonstrate on the video below).
With neck training, an ounce of prevention is worth at least a pound of cure. Don't get sidelined again by a neck injury. Make neck training part of your program.
Train hard, train safe.
DETROIT - The's plan to promote top prospect Sean Manaea, a 24-year-old left-hander acquired from Kansas City in the Ben Zobrist deal, to start Friday at the Coliseum, according to multiple sources.
Manaea is putting up sensation numbers at Triple-A Nashville, where they have allowed 16 hits, three runs and four walks in 18 innings - while striking out 21. They had been scheduled to start Thursday for Nashville so will be working on an extra day of rest against the Astros.
Opponents are batting .232 against Manaea - and left-handed hitters just .077.
Jesse Hahn, who was in Oakland's rotation last year before a forearm ended their season, was the other consideration for Friday's start after Eric Surkamp was demoted on Monday, but Hahn is dealing with a blister issue. He's also pitching well, with a 2.04 ERA at Nashville, but he's walked nine and allowed 16 hits in 17 2/3 innings.
UC Berkeley PD's Transphobia Problem by Oaks4Peace

Alcohol dependent (AD) individuals have reduced central serotonergic neurotransmission.
Childhood maltreatment can also have a negative impact on central serotonergic neurotransmission.
A new study has found that self-reported childhood emotional abuse is associated with a 90-percent reduction in central serotonergic neurotransmission in male AD individuals.
Individuals who drink excessively or are alcohol dependent (AD) have reduced central serotonergic neurotransmission, which can have an impact on planning, judgment, self-control, and emotional regulation. Childhood maltreatment has also been found to have a negative impact on central serotonergic neurotransmission. A new evaluation of the impact of childhood maltreatment on central serotonergic dysfunction in AD individuals has found that self-reported childhood emotional abuse is associated with a 90-percent reduction in central serotonergic neurotransmission in male AD individuals.
Results will be published in the May 2013 issue of Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research and are currently available at Early View.
"We know that reduced central serotonergic neurotransmission may also be involved in anxiety and depressive disorders, impulsivity, and sleep disorders," said Kristina J. Berglund, associate professor at the University of Gothenburg as well as corresponding author for the study. "It is not known how long these behavioral effects last, but it is possible that reduced central serotonergic neurotransmission may recover after several years of abstinence from alcohol."
"The 'size' or 'capacity' of the serotonin system has for a long time been associated with temperament and behavior," added Lars Oreland, a professor emeritus in the department of neuroscience at the University of Uppsala. "Generally, a low serotonergic capacity has been associated with lower impulse control and higher degree of aggressiveness. Low capacity can either be of advantage where risk-taking or extraversion is beneficial, or a disadvantage involving an increased risk of antisocial behaviour, drug abuse, vulnerability for depression, and alcoholism."
Oreland said that a low serotonergic capacity can be the result of mainly two factors: genetic inheritance and the environment. "When those two factors interact, the result is greater than just addition," they said. "Several studies indicate that environmental factors affect the activity of genes, irreversibly in the individual, by so-called epigenetic mechanisms. This means that chemical groups are attached to the DNA, or other components of the chromosome, as an effect of life-events, especially early ones. Early adverse life events or chronic stress might induce such mechanisms by way of an effect of increased levels of the stress hormone, cortisol."
"This is the first study to look at the effects of central serotonergic dysfunction of both AD and childhood maltreatment in humans," noted Berglund.
They and their colleagues recruited 18 adult men with an AD diagnosis from outpatient treatment units. Central serotonergic neurotransmission was assessed by a prolactin response to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram. Childhood maltreatment was assessed retrospectively through use of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).
"We found that self-reported maltreatment, particularly emotional abuse, is associated with a dramatic reduction - 90 percent - in central serotonergic neurotransmission in male AD individuals," said Berglund. "Emotional abuse was defined according to the established and often used CTQ, and includes verbal insults and derogatory words such as lazy, ugly, and stupid."
"The authors have used a reliable method for estimating serotonin capacity, the prolactine hormone in the blood," said Oreland. "This simple but very clever approach by the authors was also a more sensitive method than previously used, which might better reflect serotonergic capacity in brain areas with a greater sensitivity for decrease/damage, possibly due to epigenetic effects, that have been induced by adverse life events."
Both Berglund and Oreland were surprised by the dramatic nature of the findings.
"Such a dramatic effect, or rather, a high order of magnitude of early adverse life events, is indeed almost shocking," said Oreland. "It is tempting to speculate that the method used by the authors happened to pinpoint the exact spot where hormonal, here prolactine, regulation and central serotonin sensitivity for childhood maltreatment converge on a certain area in the brain."
"It is already known that childhood trauma may increase the risk for various psychiatric disorders, including AD, and that dysfunction in central serotonin neurotransmission may also increase the risk for psychiatric disorders," said Berglund. "The contribution of our findings is that there seems to be a strong relationship between childhood trauma and dysfunctional serotonin neurotransmission in AD individuals. While the mechanism behind this relationship is still unknown, it would be wise for a clinician to assess for possible childhood trauma since the combination of childhood trauma and excessive alcohol intake seems to be extremely deleterious for brain."
Both Berglund and Oreland noted the small number of patients in this study and recommended future research. "It would be interesting to examine how the combination of childhood maltreatment and genetic constitution on central serotonergic function might lead to the development of a certain type of alcoholism, as there are several ways of classifying alcoholism," said Oreland.

Have you ever wondered which talented K-pop artists have the largest number of self-composed, copyright registered songs? The Korea Music Copyright Association has your answer!
The top 7 artists with the largest number of copyright registered tracks include Big Bang's G-Dragon, B2ST's Junhyung, Block B's Zico, CNBLUE's Yonghwa, SHINee's Jonghyun, JYJ's Jaejoong, and B1A4's Jinyoung! You can see the total number of registered song below, as well as the total number of solely self-composed tracks per artist.
G-Dragon has landed an overall rank in 1st place with a total of 160 registered songs! For solely self-composed songs, Yonghwa and Jinyoung both took #1 with a total of 24 songs. You can also notice that about 2/3 of Jinyoung's registered songs are solely self-composed! Impressive!
Overall, don't you agree that these top 7 male idol artists represent some of k-pop's the most talented composers? They're not only fantastic on stage, but also in the studio!
*After looking into the source, allkpop discovered that the creator of the chart left out B.A.P's Bang Yong Guk, who should be in 5th place under Yonghwa with a total 66 registered songs. In addition, according to last year's data from KMCA, the creator of the chart also made a mistake in listing JYJ's Junsu, when the name should have been JYJ's Jaejoong. We apologize for any confusions.
At Stellar we talk a lot about the troubling lack of access to financial services. Today, however, the World Bank Group (WBG) brings us heartening news:
Since 2011 700 million new people have gained access to bank accounts, mobile money, or other financial institutions. Worldwide financial access has increased 20%.
WBG President Jim Yong Kim said, “Access to financial services can serve as a bridge out of poverty. We have set a hugely ambitious goal—universal financial access by 2020 —and now we have evidence that we're making major progress.”
What the numbers mean
Studies link broader access to and participation in the financial system with job creation and increased education. The poor can better manage risk and absorb financial shocks when they're included in financial services.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, mobile money accounts are expanding access to finance. Data show big opportunities for boosting financial inclusion among women and the poor. Here at Stellar, we hope to contribute with Vumi, an initiative by the Praekelt Foundation that uses our open-source protocol to let young girls save in airtime minutes.
Towards universal access
There's still work to be done. In the poorest 40% of households in developing countries, more than half of adults were still financially excluded in 2014. And the gender gap persists: even in 2014, women were 7% less likely to have access than men.
Achieving universal financial access in the next five years is an ambitious goal. but we're optimistic and committed. Stellar can help by providing accessible payments infrastructure and increasing financial literacy.
Want to be part of making universal financial access a reality? Volunteer with Stellar or share this exciting news.

The New Jersey governor is back in the game, say strategists. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)
Influential Republicans in early presidential primary states believe New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is poised to once again become a frontrunner for the party's 2016 nomination, following a news report that federal scrutiny of a bridge-closing scandal has not implicated him.
“If they had been found in the wrong, they would have been irreparably damaged,” said Matt Moore, chairperson of the South Carolina Republican Party. “This is hugely helpful.”
Not having the episode “hanging over their head puts them back where they started from,” said Chuck Laudner, an Iowa-based strategist for former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum's 2012 presidential campaign. “He's still a rock star and a compelling guy, even if they are too moderate for some conservatives. We're glad he's on our team.”
WNBC, the NBC affiliate in New York City, reported Thursday that a federal investigation into politically-motivated lane closures last year on the George Washington Bridge has yielded no link to Christie.
The nine-month inquiry has “thus far uncovered no evidence indicating that they either knew in advance or directed the closure of traffic lanes on the span,” according to the report.
Federal officials have declined to comment on an ongoing investigation.
Christie's wealthy friends in Republican finance circles also expressed confidence that the governor has escaped what has been seen as the leading obstacle to their potential candidacy.
“It's great news for Chris politically,” said real-estate mogul Donald Trump in a phone interview on Friday. “It goes a long way and pretty much clears up the problem they had, which was a very big problem. A lot of Republican donors are very happy today.”
“This was always a shadow,” said former New Jersey governor Tom Kean (R), a longtime Christie mentor. “But if it's gone, they are set to be first tier, and in a campaign where money is everything, they are the best fundraiser in the party.”
Paul J. Fishman, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, has been looking into the role in the affair played by Christie, their predecessor as the state's federal prosecutor, for much of the year, and issued a flurry of grand jury subpoenas to Christie aides and state Republican officials.
Several lanes approaching the bridge were closed last September. Emails and text messages from then-Christie administration officials have shown that the traffic snarl was political retribution against a Democratic mayor who did not endorse Christie's reelection bid.
Christie seized on the news report Thursday when they appeared on WKXW-FM radio, a New Jersey station.
“I'm not surprised,” they said in an interview. “But, you know, you're always grateful to hear that the things that I said appear like they're going to be confirmed if these reports are accurate.”
National Democrats are skeptical that the news report means Christie will suddenly escape being tied to the lane closures.
“A year later no one can answer the simple question: why did the Christie Administration order the lane closure?” said Michael Czin, press secretary for the Democratic National Committee. “We still don't know why some of Governor Christie's closest aides and allies deliberately put lives at risk last year. And we don't know what all the investigations will ultimately find. But what we do know is that Chris Christie established a culture of intimidation that allowed this to happen.”
Christie, as this year's chairperson of the Republican Governors Association, has been busy traveling the country in recent months and raising money for GOP candidates. The position previously served as a launching pad for Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee.
Stops this year have included visits to South Carolina, Iowa, and New Hampshire, all critical states in the early campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.
Some young former Christie aides have taken campaign jobs in New Hampshire, where Christie has stumped multiple times. The moves suggest they and their allies are bolstering key relationships ahead of a run.
Colin Reed, a former Christie spokesperson, is managing Republican Scott Brown's campaign against Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Matt Mowers, a former Christie campaign aide, is executive director of the state GOP.
William Palatucci, a Christie political adviser, said Christie's focus “remains squarely on 2014.”
“We have a lot of work to do over the next 45 days to finish the job they started in December,” Palatucci said. “Nothing is going to keep them from that mission.”
Christie said at a news conference on Thursday that they will make a final decision on a presidential campaign at “the beginning of next year.”
Their path ahead in a possible campaign through the Republican presidential primaries is far from cleared, with many conservative leaders and activists still wary of the blue-state governor's sharp tongue and what they describe as centrist impulses.
“Movement conservatives that I know do not believe they qualify as a conservative,” said Morton Blackwell, a Virginian and member of the Republican National Committee. “He has appointed non-conservative judges and they don't do favors for conservative organizations.”
“It's clear he's going nowhere with the conservative base due to their record,” said Steve Deace, a conservative talk-radio host in Iowa. “He'd be a strong candidate — for the Democrats.”
Christie's tensions with New York gubernatorial candidate Rob Astorino (R) have also drawn fire from tea party activists who say Christie should do more to raise money for him.
"We don't pay for landslides and we don't invest in lost causes," Christie said in July when asked about Astorino's campaign.
Astorino, who is challenging New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), has criticized Christie for being too politically cozy with their Democratic foe, and called on Christie to consider stepping down from their national campaign post.
Christie's potential rivals, such as Gov. Bobby Jindal (R-La.) and Gov. Rick Perry (R-Tex.) have made a point of rallying behind Astorino. Perry will host a fundraiser for them later this month; Jindal will do the same in October.
A poll last month by Suffolk University and USA Today had Christie in second place among Iowa voters who lean Republican and plan to participate in the presidential caucuses. They trailed former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.
Meanwhile, problems remain for Christie at home. New Jersey's credit ratings have been downgraded several times since they took office, a $2.4 billion casino that opened two years ago has shuttered in Atlantic City, N.J., and a state legislative committee continues to investigate the bridge incident.
A clash with Democrats over whether New Jersey should take part in a cap-and-trade program to combat climate change has been another issue that has flared up this month, with Christie resistant to having the state join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
Christie has called the climate-change program “useless.” They blasted state Democrats on Thursday for how they have handled their investigation and claimed that leaks from the panel have been used to hurt their political standing.
“If they can't run their own ship, they shouldn't be running an investigation,” they told reporters. “These are people who are addicted to MSNBC and the front page of the paper and nobody wants to cover it anymore.”

A Bruce Sterling, visionario scrittore di fantascienza originario del Texas, uno dei padri fondatori della letteratura cyberpunk e anticipatore profetico di innovazioni tecnologiche, Napoli non ha fatto un bell'effetto. «In Texas giro con la pistola, in Italia invece non è consentito, ma qui mi sentirei a mio agio». Causa di queste aspre parole — «di Napoli conosco il passato e l'immondizia» — è stato lo spiacevole episodio che, mercoledì mattina, ha coinvolto lui e la moglie nei pressi della Stazione Garibaldi. Erano diretti agli scavi di Pompei e sono stati rapinati con tanto di pistola. I ladri hanno preso soldi, carte di credito e passaporti gettando entrambi nello sconforto e nel panico.
All'incontro con gli studenti della Apple Academy Sterling è in città da qualche giorno in occasione dell'incontro «Creare Ponti. Per un modello mediterraneo di impresa 4.0» che ha tenuto ieri con gli studenti della Apple Developer Academy, il campus realizzato a San Giovanni a Teduccio dal colosso americano in collaborazione con l'università Federico II e ad oggi l'unica accademia in Europa. Qui Sterling ha inaugurato una serie di incontri ispirazionali insistendo sul concetto europeo di 4.0 che ha in sé già il 5.0. «Non basta saper realizzare un'app – ha spiegato Alex Giordano, docente del dipartimento di Scienze Sociali della Federico II – bisogna capire lo spirito del tempo. Per gli universitari è fondamentale esplorare la visione evolutiva dell'innovazione e lo facciamo con Sterling che trent'anni fa già parlava di stampanti 3d».
Agli Scavi Ad ogni modo lo scrittore statunitense è poi riuscito a visitare gli scavi archeologici e ne è rimasto colpito: «Pompei – ha dichiarato – è simbolo di distruzione e rigenerazione, proprio come la gente del Sud. D'altronde qui la terra trema ma le persone continuano ad abitarla da migliaia di anni, dopo la catastrofe sono capaci di rialzarsi. La stessa risposta arriverà anche dalle compagnie di tecnologia». Dopo aver visitato gli scavi e aver mangiato una pizza non eccellente — «a Pompei c'è un cattivo venditore di pizza anche se da oggi perfino la sua pizza è patrimonio dell'Unesco» — individua nel cibo un possibile modello di sviluppo, sulla scia di Slow Food Piemonte che è riuscita ad arginare il re del fast food Mc Donald's: «Sembrava potesse conquistare il mondo e invece si è preso solo una fetta dell'economia del cibo».
Come in Gomorra Ma la difficile realtà napoletana Sterling l'aveva già conosciuta attraverso il romanzo «Gomorra» di Roberto Saviano, di cui loda le doti di scrittore e giornalista, perché, seppur si tratti di «novel», spiega bene le dinamiche della camorra che lui appella con il nome di «gang». I napoletani, però, sono protagonisti di alcuni suoi racconti appartenenti al filone dello steampunk: «In uno di questi il protagonista è un eroe del Risorgimento e questo ha dell'assurdo perché i napoletani non lo sono stati». Ma a interessarlo particolarmente è la figura di Gioacchino Murat che potrebbe ispirare un suo prossimo lavoro: «Lo vedo simile a Donald Trump, vestito bene e sempre a cavallo per risolvere questioni politiche. Alla fine ad ammazzarlo sono stati quelli del Sud ed è per questo che non bisogna sottovalutarli».
Il futuro della società Napoli, città dalle mille contraddizioni agli occhi di chiunque, viene però considerata da Adam Ardvisson, anche lui docente del dipartimento di Scienze Sociale della Federico II, come «la rappresentazione più realistica di quello che sarà il modello europeo occidentale. È una città globale come lo sono Istanbul e Tangeri, non come Londra e Parigi, e deve elaborare un personale modello di impresa 4.0. D'altronde con Trump assistiamo alla fine del modello statunitense che non produce più ricchezza, innovazione, riferimenti culturali, mentre si afferma il modello cinese che guarda al Mediterraneo e si sviluppa lungo l'antica via della seta». Nuovi orizzonti soprattutto per la tecnologia: «Non si investirà più nel digitale – ha sentenziato infine Sterling - abbiamo aggeggi elettronici piccoli e belli ma i ponti che crollano e l'aria inquinata, è tempo di dedicarci alle infrastrutture, ai trasporti, all'energia, ai materiali di costruzione e a una nuova organizzazione della vita».
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Internal Revenue Service has left sensitive taxpayer information vulnerable to disgruntled IRS employees, contractors or hackers, according to independent auditors.
The IRS has left taxpayer information vulnerable to hackers, according to Treasury Department auditors.
The IRS has not done enough to safeguard some of its computer systems, and unscrupulous people could "reconfigure routers and switches" and "steal taxpayer information in a number of ways," according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration office, which serves a watchdog function over the IRS.
The IRS says it has addressed the concerns raised in the report.
At issue is the security of routers and switches, devices that determine the proper path for data to travel between computer networks, TIGTA said. Because the IRS sends sensitive taxpayer and government information across its networks, it must have security controls to deter and detect unauthorized users.
The report did not indicate whether any taxpayer information has ever been misdirected or stolen from IRS computers. But it said that on more than 84 percent of the 5.2 million occasions that employees accessed a system to administer and configure routers, they used "accounts" that were not properly authorized.
To ensure security, the IRS had authorized 374 accounts for employees and contractors to use when they performed system administration duties, TIGTA said. Of those, authorization for 86 had expired at the time of TIGTA's review in 2007, and there was no record that 55 employee and contractor accounts had ever been authorized.
"We are particularly concerned that 27 of the 55 employees and contractors had accessed the routers and switches to change security configurations," wrote Michael R. Phillips, the deputy inspector general who wrote the report.
In addition, nine accounts were still active, even though the employees and contractors had not accessed the system for more than 90 days, the report says. The IRS should have automatically prevented users from accessing routers and switches after 90 days, it says.
The report does not say whether taxpayer information was misused, but says it is continuing to review security to see whether changes made to the computer system were appropriate or warranted.
In a written response accompanying the report, the IRS said it has made some changes and is continuing to improve the control and monitoring of controls and switches. All 369 users now have current and valid authorizations on file, the IRS said. E-mail to a friend

Keeping the president out of the country
President Obama is the third most travelled occupant of the Oval Office since the Second World War.
Comparing their record to other two term presidents, they are beaten by their immediate predecessors President G.W. Bush (2001-2009) and President Clinton (1993-2001).

"Truly a tribute to the original [classic]. There is a tremendous amount of depth and insight into this work, an exploration of the five elements of life (the 'five rings' of the title) that represent the cosmic Buddha. Readers get complex but eminently readable explorations of each ring and are led to see them all together as an overriding philosophy that enriches and broadens the life of any reader." —Jason Sacks, Comics Bulletin
"This graphic adaptation of Musashi's seventeenth-century treatise on the martial arts makes careful, effective use of imagery to emphasize both the narrative and instructional aspects of the original text. . . . Musashi's lessons, in their focus on preparation and mindfulness, can easily be applied to most areas of life. Kutsuwada's art is delicate and clean, balancing the physiological dynamics of swordplay with a clear-eyed appreciation of Musashi's natural environment. An engaging, thoughtful update of what could be esoteric." —Publishers Weekly
Tuesday's GOP debate hosted by Fox Business was quite good. One of the most memorable moments occurred when [mc_name name='Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)' chamber='senate' mcid='P000603′ ] and [mc_name name='Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)' chamber='senate' mcid='R000595′ ] clashed over military spending.
Paul pointed out that Rubio plans to boost military spending by $1 trillion ($100 billion a year over 10 years). Rubio notes their plans to go back to 2012 levels on their website.
(Benjamin Friedman notes that even this increase would not cover Rubio's ambitious priorities.)
The debate was not the first time the two have faced off on this issue.
In March, Rubio offered an amendment that would have increased military spending by $190 billion over the next two years. That is $190 billion also added to the national debt. Paul, attempting to circumvent the amendment, conceded the increase in military spending but offered to at least offset it with cuts in other areas, thereby making it deficit-neutral. For some inexplicable reason, Rubio opposed it and stuck with their deficit-increasing amendment (as did fellow candidate [mc_name name='Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)' chamber='senate' mcid='C001098′ ]).
What Rubio presents is a false choice: that we must increase the debt or be weak on national security.
As Admiral Mike Mullen has pointed out, the national debt IS the top national security threat we face.
Rubio is correct that there are threats in the world. And nobody disagrees. National defense is without a doubt the most important thing (and one of the few constitutionally authorized) the federal government does. But exactly how much should we spend?
Paul brought up how much we spend in comparison with the rest of the world. They aren't advocating we cut ourselves down to their level (his budgets have not proposed that), but the point is we are spending a large amount of money in relation to our main adversaries. It is always important to keep perspective.
And it is also important to keep in mind that government is naturally inefficient and corrupt. We recently learned that the taxpayers funded a $43 million dollar gas station overseas. Surely that does not improve our national security. As conservatives, we believe that blindly throwing money at the problem is not the solution, and that should apply to all aspects of government.
Former Senator Tom Coburn, a deficit and waste hawk, strongly supports and introduced legislation to audit the Pentagon. Rand Paul has since taken up the cause in Congress. We really have to know what money is being spent on before we can assess what the correct level should be.
Finally, I would like to remind people how [mc_name name='Rep. John Boehner (R-OH)' chamber='house' mcid='B000589′ ]'s “golden parachute” budget deal happened. Democrats and Republicans joined together to bust the budget caps, respectively supporting increases in domestic and military spending. We will never be able to save this country from debt if we continue down that path.
Again, nobody is saying domestic and military spending should be treated equally. Paul isn't calling for the budget to be balanced on the back of the military. Their point is that while it should be the main thing we fund, but we must be frugal in our approach.
No increases to the debt at this point are acceptable, period. Rand Paul gets it and Marco Rubio should know better.

Aspirin makes it harder for blood clots to form Men and women over a certain age should take aspirin daily to prevent heart attacks, experts say in Heart journal. Nottingham and Sheffield universities' analysis of almost 12,000 patients found men from the age of 48 and women from 57 would benefit from the drug. Heart attacks occur when a blood vessel is blocked by a clot, but aspirin makes it harder for blood clots to form. The British Heart Foundation said more research was needed before "blanket prescribing" could be recommended. We would encourage everyone to examine their own individual risk and take steps to reduce it by adjusting their lifestyle
Dr Mike Knapton
British Heart Foundation Under existing recommendations, a GP will prescribe the drug if a person has already suffered a heart attack or a stroke. It is also prescribed if factors such as high blood pressure put a patient at high risk of having such an "event" in the next few years. But the researchers said, in reality, many people are not treated. Some have speculated it may be easier to treat everyone over a specific age threshold such as 50 years. Risks An analysis of almost 12,000 patients aged between 30 and 75 showed that by the age of 47 in men and 58 in women, the 10-year coronary heart disease risk is 10% - a risk worth treating, the researchers said. At that point, unless someone is at risk of dangerous side effects because they have a condition such as a stomach ulcer, the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, they concluded. But this did not apply to people with diabetes or those at high risk of bleeding, the researchers said. Although diabetics are likely to benefit from aspirin treatment because of their high heart disease risk, the evidence is not yet quite clear, they added. And in anyone over the age of 75 years, the decision whether or not to take aspirin must be made on an individual basis, because they are more likely to suffer bleeding complications. Study leader Dr Iskandar Idris, an honorary senior lecturer at Sheffield University, said routinely prescribing aspirin in these age groups was a feasible option. But they added: "The final decision about use of aspirin must eventually be made after discussion with a healthcare provider." Dr Mike Knapton, director of prevention and care at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Currently the recommendations in the UK are that aspirin is prescribed after a full risk assessment under medical supervision to those who have established cardiovascular disease. "Further robust research is needed before aspirin should be considered as a blanket primary prevention measure in the UK. "We would encourage everyone to examine their own individual risk and take steps to reduce it by adjusting their lifestyle."

Oscar-winning composer Dario Marianelli was presented with a unique opportunity with Laika's “Kubo and the Two Strings”: Creating a score for a film in which the music specifically drives much of the narrative.
“For me it's always a bit of a mixed blessing when a film like that arrives,” Marianelli says. “It's almost like having to split myself in two. I had to create an entirely new personality for the player that is in the film, and at the same time I have to keep my own personality for the rest of the score, and hopefully there is going to be a meeting point for the two.”
The film, which tells the story of shamisen-wielding youngster Kubo who can bring objects to life with their fierce plucking, is the second Laika movie for Marianelli after “The Boxtrolls.” They say they enjoy the company's process because, unlike most movies where the composer is brought in to put the cherry on top so to speak, he's involved from the beginning, because the animators need their work as a guide.
There was of course a lot of cultural flavor to their score, which incorporates instruments like the shakuhachi, taiko drums, and koto in addition to the shamisen, but the score also represents for Marianelli a collision of western and eastern musical tendencies.

“What we know of our very crude perception of western music is the pentatonic scale that you find on the black keys of the piano,” they explain. “But in fact there is a wealth of variety of scales in the east, so just digging a little deeper and learning about Japanese scales brought into the music much more depth, I think.”
There is also an action-film vibe to the work, which sounds particularly interesting when performed with the atypical instrumentation. That was also something that spoke to the spirit of the lead character.
“There's a rebellious and almost rock-and-roll soul to Kubo that is reflected in the playing,” Marianelli says. “It was a combination of very delicate, at times, and very soulful playing, but other times they can really unleash hell with their instrument and can be a proper rock and roller.”

The tension of not knowing. It can be excruciating. Like an itch you can't scratch. Like a song stuck in your head you can't quite place. The feeling of dread that something isn't quite right. Sometimes in life, nothing is worse than not knowing.
When it comes to our 45th president — Donald J. Trump — and their seemingly endless parade of suspicious connections, erratic behaviors, and general lack of, well, being good at their job, the possibility of impeachment has been placed perpetually on the table.
While the debate may rage amongst pundits, we thought it would be useful to put the question into more scientific terms. Will they or won't he? Frankly there's no real way of knowing, but looking at this dial hopefully gives you some sense that there is order to the world.

The official death toll from the powerful earthquake which hit Tainan city in Taiwan last Saturday has risen to 94.
Efforts continue to find at least 30 people who are still missing, but hopes are fading of anyone being found alive.
On Friday, the president and president- elect attended a memorial service held by relatives of the dead and missing.
All but two of the people killed had been inside one building in Tainan, which completely collapsed.
Lin Ming-hui, the developer of the Weiguan Jinlong (Golden Dragon) complex, and two architects have been detained on suspicion of negligence, amid accusations the building was poorly constructed.

The US Emergency Alert System, which interrupts live TV and radio broadcasts with information about national emergencies in progress, is vulnerable to attacks that allow hackers to remotely disseminate bogus reports and tamper with gear, security researchers warned.
The remote takeover vulnerability, which was fixed in an update issued in April, affected the DASDEC-I and DASDEC-II application servers made by a company called Digital Alert Systems. It stems from a recent firmware update that mistakenly included the private secure shell (SSH) key, according to an advisory published Monday by researchers from security firm IOActive. Administrators use such keys to remotely log in to a server to gain unfettered "root" access. The publication of the key makes it trivial for hackers to gain unauthorized access on Digital Alert System appliances that run default settings on older firmware.
"An attacker who gains control of one or more DASDEC systems can disrupt these stations' ability to transmit and could disseminate false emergency information over a large geographic area," the IOActive advisory warned. "In addition, depending on the configuration of this and other devices, these messages could be forwarded and mirrored by other DASDEC systems."
Other advisories warning of the vulnerability were published here and here by the Industry Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team and the US CERT. The US CERT advisory, which also warns against vulnerabilities in the One-Net E189 Emergency Alert System device sold by Digital Alert Systems' parent company Monroe Electronics, was published two weeks ago.
The warnings come five months after hackers took over the emergency alert system of a Montana TV station and broadcast a bogus emergency bulletin warning TV viewers of an imminent zombie apocalypse. Devices used by stations in Michigan, California, Tennessee, and New Mexico were also reportedly commandeered. "Civil authorities in your area have reported that the bodies of the dead are rising from the grave and attacking the living," at least one of the prank messages said. The advisories from IOActive and the CERT groups didn't say if the February attacks were carried out by exploiting the SSH key vulnerability.
The Emergency Alerting System is designed to enable the US president to deliver speeches to the entire country within 10 minutes of a disaster occurring. Application servers such as the DASDEC-I and DASDEC-II interrupt regular programming broadcast by TV and radio stations and relay an emergency message, which is preceded and followed by alert tones. In addition to tampering with the delivery of legitimate emergency messages, attackers who use the SSH key to log in to vulnerable systems could make unauthorized changes to the server and glean potentially sensitive configure information that could lead to additional hacks.
Stations that use vulnerable gear should upgrade to version 2.0-2, which is available by sending an e-mail to support@digitalalertsystems.com.
Update on July 12, 2013: A Monroe Electronics representative said the vulnerability played no role in the bogus Zombie apocalypse warnings. The representative also said they were "pretty sure" no Tennessee stations were affected by the fake warnings. This article has been updated in the second paragraph to make clear the vulnerability was fixed in April.
For those of you that don't know who Kaya is I'll give a bit of background on them At just 14 years old they turned ASA Pro, and continued to dominate Womens Rollerblading, street and park. They would reach the podium in pro Men events, and put out street sections that would put most men to shame. At the age of 17 they discovered skiing (thanks to D-Structure selling both rollerblades and twin tip ski's). After working a job at two Subway locations they saved up just enough money to work on their skiing in Whistler. Within the year they signed their first pro contract. At age 28, they have now been a professional athlete for half of their life.
After skating, We had a late lunch and talked about a few things.
So you and I always grab Lebanese food, how do you rate the Montreal Lebanese food?
Lebanese food is delicious in Montreal! Food in general is delicious… just because Montreal is such a intimate city, its a melting pot and everything is in close proximity. Only when I started traveling to different cities in North America I realized how good we really have it in Montreal, on how ethnically and cultural diverse it is – with that comes a lot of great cuisine. (laughs) It's true man, its so good, we've got it so good here.
So your moving from LA to Vancouver, what's going on with that?
Well I moved to LA 3 years ago, I had the beach itch, and after 3 years I've decided to come back to Canada. So I'm making the move… I wanted to stay on the west coast, I love the active, healthy vibe, and the mild climate. I just wanted to move north back to my home country, since I spend a lot of time in whistler and Squamish and train with the Canadian ski team.
So will you be skating a lot in Vancouver?
I'd like to, I'm going to reach out, you just invited me to the Vancouver Rollerblading Facebook group. Just got on my skates this morning for the first time in forever, and it feels amazing. It's like I get this high, and it brings back right back to 15 years ago, my first big life.

So your skating Seba skates now, how did that happen?
I reached out to Seba, just because my buddy Matt G, the interviewer, raved about them. I wanted a skate that was versatile, not just an aggressive skate, but something I could just cruise around my spot in Cali. So I reached out to Anthony, and we communicated back and forth, and at some point last year team Seba was in LA for a skate trip so I met up with the crew, and they hooked me up with a pair of FX skates. They're perfect, I love them! I also use them to cross train for skiing, jumping into the foam pit at Woodward. I learned some cool stuff in them this spring, tricks that I would have never learned without rollerblading, so It's like my secret weapon on the mountain. It's fun to cross worlds like that.
What do you do when people in the ski industry trash talk your rollerblading background?
(Laughs) I don't know, it doesn't even bug me anymore. A lot of people have respect for me once they have seen my skating, but at the same time some people still tease and you just learn to brush it off – people just don't get it. But you know what? I was thinking about something funny earlier, on how I am a minority in a few ways: Firstly, I'm a girl in a male dominated action sports world, so already I'm a massive minority, then I'm a skier, which is sometimes hated on by other sports, some people don't see it as as “cool” as snowboarding or skateboarding, then to top it off, I'm a rollerblader, which from a lot of sports is ragged on… and I freaking love it. I think its the coolest thing ever, I embrace it, I rock it. Some of my best memories are from back in the day, skating with the boys, and I owe so much of what I've learned in my life to the sport. So when people tease me about it, in the end I just laugh because they have no idea.
Kindgrind
Do you have anything ski related you can tell me?
Yeah actually, I'm going into a pretty heavy ski year next year, with the Olympic qualification process starting. I took 2 years off competing, and came back in the game this year, just because I needed some time to recheck myself, to reset the passion, and to heal my body. I felt like I had to pull out for a bit and come back on my terms, and I had a great season. I'm feeling excited for next season. This summer I'll be training, but hopefully trying to take it sort of easy, because I know it's going to be hectic going into next year.
You're back in school, whats going on with that?
Well, I'm in school currently studying psychology, I want to become a sports/performance psychologist because that kind of stuff really fascinates me. I'm a big believer in mind over matter. I'm not just throwing that term around either, I really think its a massive component, especially in athletics, especially in creative action sports – I think we can all agree to some extent.
Kaya back in their roots, hanging on top of a quarter pipe
What was that snap chat story all about where you were racing cars in Australia?
I got to race NASCAR style cars in Aus with the GoPro crew. We were going around 170 (KM/H) on a really tight, curvy course. It was crazy!
Has your traveling schedule been busy lately?
Well, recently, in one week I left Montreal, went to Toronto, did a mini marathon for RedBull (Wings For Life), flew to Aus for 4 days, flew to LA, then came back to Montreal exactly a week later. I did all that man! Lots of travel.
Whats the next step in life for Kaya?
Well the next year and a half is going to be highly dedicated to my skiing and school, I want to finish my 60 credits into my university degree. I want to transfer to UBC (university of British Columbia) after the Olympics and continue school as I continue sport.
You're a good student, straight A's?
I'm a good student, I work hard for it. All A's except for one class I got one B (laughs).
What class was that?
It was a online English class, wasn't my jam. I work my butt off in school, it's important to me, I know what I want to study so I really want to work hard at it. It's a part of my future.

Are you on Tinder?
Ohh Tinder.
What are you looking for on Tinder?
I'm looking for someone passionate, and thoughtful, cute, typically a female (laughs), yup thats it.
Cool
Age range 25-35 (we both start laughing). All types I guess, fit is important too.
Last winter you had some bad luck and broke your arm, what exactly went down?
Oh man, everything, I broke my finger too. It's still a little messed up but healing well. Doctors say its never going to look totally like it did before. 8 pins in my arm, 8 pins in my finger. Guys, I've paid my dues okay? For everyone that thinks this is the glamour life, it is in many respects and I wouldn't change a thing, but I've definitely paid my dues, and I'd like to think it shows my dedication to the sports I've been part of, ha!
(When travel comes up, Kaya playfully interrupts my question)
I went to four continents this year!
Four continents?
I think so, yeah 4 continents, I only missed South America. Also, it was the first time when I travelled around the world, I mean around the whole globe! I've travelled a lot but I've never actually went all the way around the world.
Who are you favourite bladers?
Fabiola was always my favourite, Haffey of course, Aragon because they were so ridiculously on point.
Alright Kaya, thanks a lot for your time, I really appreciate you doing this.
My pleasure buddy.

Story highlights A man dies after being pushed onto the subway tracks at a Bronx station, police say
There is a search for the male suspect, but police have few details
Police in New York City are looking for a suspect they say pushed a man to their death from the subway platform into the path of the D train on Sunday.
Police have little to go on. Lt. John Grimpel says a male suspect was wearing a dark jacket. The act is "believed to be random," they said.
Bronx resident Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, was killed by the incoming subway train, police said.
Kwok's wife was with them and was taken to the hospital for trauma, police said, though they were not physically injured.
Kwok was standing on the platform at the subway station at 167th Street and Grand Concourse, when they were apparently pushed. First responders arrived at about 8:45 a.m., and Kwok was pronounced dead at the scene.
The suspect then fled the station but has not been identified or located, police said.
The incident is being investigated as a homicide, but a motive was lacking at the outset.
Police would not speculate whether there was an altercation between Kwok and the suspect or whether there are any indications of a hate crime.
Sunday evening, police released surveillance video of a person wanted for questioning in connection with the homicide but did not call the person a suspect.
DES MOINES, Iowa — The same rift between insurgent Republicans and old-line party establishment figures that is rattling Washington is also playing out in states such as Iowa, where open warfare has broken out between veteran GOP operatives and the state party chairperson, an ally of former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas.
Those veterans want to oust A.J. Spiker, who headed Mr. Paul's 2012 presidential campaign in Iowa, insisting they aren't providing the leadership the state party needs as it gears up for congressional elections in November and for its role in 2016, when it once again will be front and center for the nation's first presidential nominating contest.
Mr. Spiker said their critics have been trying to undermine them since they were elected to the post in 2012, encouraging donors to stay on the sidelines until they leaf.
“Nationwide, there is a fight within the party really over the direction of the party,” Mr. Spiker told The Washington Times. “I was the first Ron Paul supporter to ever get elected state party chairperson, and it just so happens to be in the first-in-the-nation presidential state. So there is some big, powerful people who don't like that. What we post on Facebook could impact their bank accounts.”
In Washington, the battle exploded onto the front pages in late September and October, when Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican, led an ill-fated campaign to tie continued government funding to demands that President Obama's signature health care reform law be repealed. A government shutdown ensued and left congressional Republicans embroiled in bitter recriminations.
Mr. Cruz's opponents agreed about repealing Obamacare but said the first-year student senator failed to develop a legislative strategy after rallying grass-roots conservatives.
The battle continued into December's budget fight, with House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, breaking publicly with outside conservative activist groups that opposed the bipartisan compromise deal.
In Iowa, establishment Republicans are making no secret of their unhappiness with the head of the state party.
Dave Kochel, who has worked as a Republican adviser to Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, said Mr. Spiker is trying to cover up their incompetence by peddling a false storyline.
“The people at the headquarters, the Ron Paul faction, they want to say it is Branstad and their moderate establishment donor types who want to drive the grass roots, the conservatives out of the party — but it's absolutely not,” Mr. Kochel said.
Supporters of Mr. Romney and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania are calling for Mr. Spiker to go, they said. “There is a professional side to party mechanics that this group doesn't understand and can't institute. They focus on everything accept winning elections.”
Outmaneuvered
The frustration dates back to last year when Mr. Spiker and their supporters outmaneuvered their rivals at the state party convention, handing Mr. Paul 23 of the state's 28 delegates to the national convention — months after Mr. Paul finished third behind Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney in the presidential caucuses.
“That was probably the defining moment of the libertarian folks who run the state party,” said Will Rogers, head of the Polk County GOP, which has passed a resolution calling for Mr. Spiker to step down. “They had basically snubbed the intentions of the caucus-goers in Iowa by choosing Ron Paul.”
Mr. Rogers added, “It went downhill ever since.”
Mr. Spiker also was criticized for trying to move the date of the 2014 state convention — a move that Republicans feared would hurt the GOP Senate nominee and give the leaders of the state party a chance to tilt the election toward their favorite candidate.
Mr. Spiker has been criticized for being more interested in sparring with fellow Republicans than attacking Democrats, and too focused on pushing pet causes of the libertarian movement such as opposing a county bond issue, calling on Republicans to oppose a gas tax increase and issuing a warning about police checkpoints.
“I have been around that state party headquarters for literally 30 years,” Mr. Kochel said. “It has never been in worse shape and the reason is that it is in the worst shape is that they can't really raise money and they don't really have a mission that is designed around winning campaigns and elections.”
Mr. Spiker shrugs off the criticism.
“You've got an older authoritarian wing that believes that you ought to always just submit to government, and you've got a young wing that believes you've got civil liberties, you've got rights and you've got a right to exercise them,” they said.
They also do not apologize for coming out against GOP-backed bond issues and is dumbfounded that they are being criticized for calling on Republicans to oppose a gas tax increase.
“We were bucking the system to a degree, but right within the platform of our party is [a provision that] we oppose gas taxes,” they said. “Why in the hell would you raise them then? That is a good way to lose elections. So having a party that stands for things isn't always easy.”
Iowa as microcosm
Drew Ivers, a Spiker supporter and another member of Mr. Paul's 2012 campaign, said the GOP infighting in Iowa is a microcosm of what is playing out across the nation.
“There is a discontent with status-quo Republicanism,” Mr. Ivers said. “The role that I have tried to play for the 40 years I have been involved in the party is trying to get the Republican Party back to its traditional position of small government and get Republicans to do what they say they are going to do.”
Mr. Branstad said they are focused on making the party more welcoming, helping Iowa's economy grow and getting the state's finances in order.
“I have always encouraged more people to get involved in the Republican Party and to participate,” they said. “What we are in the process of doing is strengthening, revitalizing this party and bringing more people in. We don't want to chase anybody out. We just want to be welcoming.”
Brian Kennedy, an adviser to Mr. Romney's presidential campaign, said the internal battle in Iowa is different from the national fight because it is a struggle between the establishment and Ron Paul supporters.
“Had Ron Paul forces taken over the state party and put in a chairperson who was prepared to do the job and was doing the job the right way and working collaboratively across the party and [focused] on winning campaigns, I don't think we would much care if that chairperson supported Ron Paul or Rick Santorum or Mitt Romney,” they said.

Microsoft Ventures will invest $3.5 million in artificial-intelligence startups after competitions for the money in North America, Europe and Israel. Plans for to Innovate.Ai awards come as Microsoft ramps up its corporate focus on software that uses machine learning.
Microsoft is looking for a few good artificial-intelligence startups.
The Redmond company said Tuesday that it will launch a competition pitting startups working on intelligent technology against each other for $3.5 million in investment.
The bake-off, dubbed Innovate.Ai, will see Microsoft Ventures award $1 million loans that convert to an equity stake to one startup each from North America, Europe and Israel.
A separate, $500,000 investment will go to a startup Microsoft judges to be building products designed to improve society.
Israel is a hotbed of cutting-edge software research; Microsoft's startup investment arm has an office there, and the company has acquired a few Israeli startups in recent years.
The competition comes as Microsoft ramps up its corporate focus on software that uses machine learning to improve itself, or otherwise solves complex problems.
It's also part of a campaign to nudge more startups to use Microsoft technology. In addition to the investment, Microsoft will award its winners $500,000 in credits for Microsoft Azure, the network of on-demand processing power and other services.
Microsoft has leaned heavily on such freebies to get companies interested in its technology after Amazon Web Services built a wide lead in providing cloud-computing services to startups.
Half of the investment funding will come from other venture-capital outfits. For the North American winner, that's Seattle's Madrona Venture Group. In Europe, it's Notion Capital. And in Israel, Vertex Ventures Israel will be contributing $500,000.
Startups have until the end of the year to apply for the program.
In the latest parliamentary debate in the House of Lords on UK recognition of palestinian statehood, Baroness Deech tells it like it is.
Here is the full transcript of them speech:
Baroness Deech (CB): My Lords, with unfortunate timing, this debate is taking place two days after International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In the 70 years since the liberation of Auschwitz, despite the millions spent on Holocaust education and remembrance, the museums and memorials and the school visits to concentration camps, there is a gap in memory and education that needs to be bridged. The desire and opportunity to murder 6 million people of a different religion whose presence on their territory the murderer resents must not arise again. The message Jews took from the Holocaust was that their nationalism was necessary. It has been a success. Israel is not Saudi Arabia; it is not North Korea, Iran or Pakistan. It is a flourishing and democratic outpost in the desert with an astonishing record. It is a safe haven, an imperative for existence that can be applied to no other country in the world.
Yasser Arafat declared an independent state of Palestine in 1988 and recognition followed from 100 states. The subsequent failure to change anything on the ground demonstrates the truth of the international law on recognition: namely, that statehood has to be founded in fact, not in numbers of recognitions.
As far as this Motion goes, almost every word of it is dubious. There can be no contribution towards a two-state solution because recognition of Palestine, falsely based, will only make the situation more dangerous. There can be no two-state solution unless Palestine recognises Israel, which they have steadfastly refused to do. There is no statehood attaching to Palestine in international law because it does not meet the criteria. A sovereign state of a Muslim Palestine has never existed—not before 1948, and not before 1967. It was Egyptian and Jordanian territory. Ehud Olmert's offer of a state was rejected in 2009. The intention of many of the players in the region has always been the elimination of a Jewish presence in the area, not the establishment of yet one more Muslim state. The problem with Israel is not that it has displaced anyone; according to its neighbours, the problem is that its population is largely Jewish.
The practical result of a premature state of Palestine would simply be to free up the import of arms into the new state. The aim underlying this move is the takeover of Israel. Why is there no preparation by the Palestinians for statehood? There is no governance structure, no independent administration, no industrialisation and no negotiation of trade agreements with its neighbour, Israel. The state would not be a state in any recognisable form. Its leaders have declared that the current residents, whose status as refugees defies all logic, would remain defined as refugees. They would not be granted citizenship, nor would the state of Palestine open its doors to the Palestinian diaspora—those Palestinians whose miserable lives in Syria, Egypt, Lebanon and elsewhere in the region are worse than the lives of those in Gaza and the West Bank. It has also declared that it would be a Judenrein state, unlike the 1.8 million Arab residents of Israel who have chosen to stay there.
So if a state has no citizens, and will not grant them citizenship in defiance of international law, what would it be for? It would be for a closer jumping-off point for the demolition of the State of Israel in pursuance of the alleged right of return. As other noble Lords have said, Fatah and Hamas want a one-state solution. Why should Israel recognise Palestine if there is no reciprocity but only a step towards elimination in return?
In the climate of extremism that is sweeping Europe, why should a country want to take a step that risks feeding it more? The only purpose is manipulative—to allow Palestinians to pursue claims against Israel at the UN and other international bodies. In the face of what is happening in Europe, what agenda do the proponents serve? Would it not be a good idea to examine the excesses of this position and turn to state building on the ground as an alternative?
Israel's antagonists often accuse them of apartheid. In the worst times of genuine apartheid in South Africa, Mandela was planning their future independent country's constitution, educating its leaders, preaching peace, not vengeance, and acting as a statesman. In the early days of Zionism, before statehood, the Jewish residents of what was to be Israel prepared their governance structure, set up the organs of a state, created universities, made the desert bloom, prepared a legal system and a free press, trade unions, hospitals and charities. None of this is present in the Palestinian leadership; nothing is readied. It is not a state under international law, but I have no time to describe that.
The worst element, of course, is that the residents will not be citizens but will be regarded as refugees whose aim is to return to a different state—Israel—rather than establishing citizenship in their own state, and the new state would be wholly dependent on international funds. For it to be recognised now—by the General Assembly, for example—would simply send the message to every other non-state entity in the world, such as the Basque country, Northern Cyprus, the Kurds and even Scotland, to bypass normal laws and claim to be a state. Let there be a two-state solution by all means if the Palestinians will create a homeland, accept the refugees, lay down their arms and be a country of peace.
TORONTO — Ontario's auditor general is sounding the alarm about the province's ballooning debt in their annual report, warning that it continues to grow faster than the province's economy.
In their 600-page annual report released Tuesday, Bonnie Lysyk cautioned that despite Ontario's work to eliminate its deficit, the province's rising net debt — the difference between its liabilities and its total assets — could have a number of negative implications for its finances in the future.
Ontario's majority Liberal government has pledged to eliminate its $12.5-billion deficit by 2017-18. But by that year, the province's net debt will have soared to $325 billion — more than double the $156.6 billion a decade ago, Lysyk's report estimated.
“To put this in perspective, to eliminate Ontario's 2017-18 estimated net debt, every man, woman and child in Ontario would need to contribute $23,000 to the provincial coffers,” Lysyk said in their report.
The negative implications of a large debt load include debt-servicing costs diverting funding away from other government programs, greater vulnerability to interest rate increases and potential credit-rating downgrades which could lead to higher borrowing costs in the future, the report stated.
To put those implications into perspective, Lysyk's report pointed out that the government now spends more on debt interest than it does on post-secondary education, and those interest costs are growing.
“Our commentary on Ontario's increasing debt has attracted little public attention. We believe one reason for this is primarily because of the focus placed on first eliminating Ontario's annual deficit,” Lysyk wrote.
“Ultimately the question of how much debt the province should carry and the strategies that would be used by the government to pay down its debt is one of government policy. However, this should not prevent the government from providing information that promotes further understanding of the issue.”
In particular, Lysyk's report recommends the government provide more information on how it plans to achieve its target of reducing its net debt-to-GDP ratio to its pre-recession level of 27 per cent.
The provincial net debt-to-GDP ratio — a key indicator of the government's financial ability to carry its debt relative to the size of the economy — is projected to reach a high of 40.5 per cent in 2015-16, after which the government expects it to decline, the report noted.
Ontario's net debt was more than $267 billion at the end of March, the report noted.
The figure has been rising in recent years due to government borrowing to finance deficits and increased spending on infrastructure, Lysyk found.
“While annual deficits are projected to decline, the province will still be increasing its borrowings annually to finance these deficits, to replace maturing debt and to fund public infrastructure projects,” Lysyk wrote.
“In fact, net debt and total debt are both expected to continue growing in absolute terms even after the province starts to run annual budget surpluses. This important fact should not go unnoticed by members of the legislature and the public.”
The province can only begin paying down its debt when future surpluses provide cash flows “over and above” what's required to fund government operations and its net investments in capital assets, the report said.
Police officer watches on during a protest on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson (AFP)
An unnamed source has “unequivocally” knocked down the anonymous report that Officer Darren Wilson suffered broken bones near their eye socket before shooting unarmed teenager Michael Brown.
The deadly shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, provoked international outrage as police in military gear confronted protesters demanding answers from authorities in ongoing – and frequently violent – demonstrations.
Little information about the investigation has been officially released, although at least a dozen sources close to the officer or authorities have refuted witness statements about the incident.
Conservative blogger Jim Hoft – known in some quarters as “the dumbest man on the Internet” – reported Tuesday that the officer suffered an “orbital blowout fracture to the eye socket.”
The blogger, who calls themselves “The Gateway Pundit,” based their report on two unnamed sources, including one “within the Prosecuting Attorney's office and confirmed by the St. Louis County Police.”
Hoft's claims have been widely reported, despite their dubious reputation.
But CNN's Don Lemon reported Thursday afternoon that they had spoken to another “source close to the investigation” who strongly denied the blogger's claims.
“The officer, Darren Wilson, did go the hospital after the altercation and the shooting death of Michael Brown,” Lemon reported, based on the source's claims. “He did have X-rays done, they had a swollen face, but the X-rays for a broken or a torn eye socket came back negative.”
“That source says it is not true at all, they did not have a torn eye socket,” Lemon continued, “and so, he's saying that unequivocally — they unequivocally deny that, saying that it did not happen, but they did have a swollen face, they did go for X-rays.”
The CNN reporter said there was obviously “some sort of scuffle” that caused facial injuries to the officer, but Wilson did not suffer any tears, ruptures, or fractures to their orbital socket.
The St. Louis County prosecutor began presenting evidence from the case Wednesday before a grand jury, but that evidence won't include an incident report from the shooting.
The prosecutor's office revealed Thursday that Ferguson police never generated an incident report that included Wilson's account of the shooting and instead turned over the investigation almost immediately to St. Louis County police.
Prosecutors have not yet spoken to Wilson, who went into hiding shortly after the fatal shooting.
Hearsay evidence is permitted during grand jury proceedings, so some of Wilson's friends who have shared their account with the media could potentially be asked to testify before grand jurors.
Grand jury proceedings are held in secret, and transcripts and other evidence may be kept from the public unless a judge decides to release them or witnesses choose to discuss their participation after testifying.

Missouri became the third US state to accuse major drug manufacturers of misrepresenting the risks posed by opioids. About 500 Missourians have died in 2015 from non-heroin opioid overdoses, and thousands of others were hospitalized.
On Wednesday, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley filed the civil lawsuit in state court in St. Louis against Purdue Pharma LP, Endo Health Solutions, and Janssen Pharmaceuticals.
The three companies carried out a complex, multi-year campaign in which they deliberately misrepresented the addictive risks of opioids, and “engaged in a deliberate campaign of fraud to convince Missouri doctors and consumers otherwise,” according to the complaint.

"They used bogus front organizations and fake research; they used fraudulent advertising and deceptive trade practices," Hawley said in remarks prepared for a news conference. “And they repeatedly lied about the true risks of the drugs they sold."
Those action, the suit claims, caused thousands of Missourians patients to be given unnecessary opioids prescriptions, often to treat chronic pain. The complaint argues the companies violated Missouri's consumer protection laws and its Medicaid statutes, and seeks hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and civil penalties.
Opioids are a class of drugs that range from prescription pain medications like oxycodone, codeine and morphine, to illegal drugs like heroin. Opioid overdoses have killed more than 33,000 people in the US in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Hawley said the suit seeks to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable so that families that have suffered from the opioid epidemic can start to heal.
“I lost my daughter to the opioid epidemic three years ago,” Jammie Fabick told reporters. “For the sake of my daughter and all the other lives lost, we have to put a stop to this epidemic.”
Hawley said any money awarded in the Missouri suit should go toward drug rehabilitation services and efforts to help families affected by drug addiction, according to WTOP.
This makes Missouri the third US state to sue drug manufacturers over opioid marketing and sales practices. Purdue, J&J and Endo were previously sued in Ohio and Mississippi. Those lawsuits also targeted Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Allergan Plc.

Last month, Senator Claire McCaskill (D- Missouri), began an investigation of the pharmaceutical industry that included Purdue Pharma and Janssen, two of the companies named in Hawley's lawsuit.
Similar lawsuits have been filed by local governments, including two California counties; the cities of Chicago and Dayton, Ohio; three Tennessee district attorneys; and nine New York counties.
Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a division of Johnson & Johnson, said in a statement that it acted appropriately and responsibly, adding that its pain medications were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and carry mandated warnings about their known risks, according to Reuters.
Purdue, which manufactures OxyContin, said it denied the allegations but shared Hawley's concerns about the opioid crisis and was "committed to working collaboratively to find solutions."
Endo declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said its "top priorities include patient safety and ensuring that patients with chronic pain have access to safe and effective therapeutic options."
Earlier this month, the FDA asked Endo to withdraw its long-lasting opioid painkiller Opana ER from the market.

Missouri remains the only US state that has failed to create a prescription drug monitoring system, a database that allows doctors and pharmacists to keep track of patients' prescriptions.
Mozilla today announced a new project called mozjpeg, the goal of which is to provide a production-quality JPEG encoder that improves compression rates. That being said, the company wants to maintain compatibility with “the vast majority” of deployed decoders.
Over the years, the number of images an average website displays has exploded, as has the file size of each image. Since HTML, JS, and CSS files are relatively small in comparison, Mozilla points out photos can “easily make up the bulk of the network traffic for a page load.” The company thus wants to reduce the size of these files, and while JPEG has been in use since around 1992, it is still the most popular lossy compressed image format on the Web.
JPEG is the only lossy compressed image format which has achieved nearly universal compatibility, not just with Web browsers but all software that can display images. As such Mozilla argues that it's worth trying to optimize it, even with the ongoing search for a successor:
Production JPEG encoders have largely been stagnant in terms of compression efficiency, so replacing JPEG with something better has been a frequent topic of discussion. The major downside to moving away from JPEG is that it would require going through a multi-year period of relatively poor compatibility with the world's deployed software. We (at Mozilla) don't doubt that algorithmic improvements will make this worthwhile at some point, possibly soon. Even after a transition begins in earnest though, JPEG will continue to be used widely.
The company talked to engineers and concluded that JPEG encoders haven't yet reached their full compression potential, even after 20 years and within the constraints of strong compatibility requirements.
Today's mozjpeg version 1.0 release is a fork of libjpeg-turbo with ‘jpgcrush' functionality added. The latter is a Perl script written by Loren Merritt which losslessly reduces file sizes by figuring out which progressive coding configuration uses the fewest bits. Results for mozjpeg range from 2-6 percent for PNGs encoded to JPEG by libjpeg-turbo and 10 percent on average for a sample of 1,500 JPEG files from Wikimedia.
Mozilla says it is not aware of any other production encoder that has this functionality built in, so the company decided to include it as mozjpeg's first feature. The project's next goal is to improve encoding by making use of trellis quantization. We'll keep you posted as the project progresses and Mozilla shares its results.

STORRS, Conn. -- Connecticut center Andre Drummond said Friday they have declared for the NBA draft after a single season of college basketball.
The 18-year-old first-year student averaged 10 points for the Huskies this season while leading the team in rebounding at 7.6 per game.
"My family and I feel that this is the right time for me to take the next step in my basketball career," Drummond said. "It has always been a goal of mine to compete against the world's best players and that is one of the big factors for me in making this decision."
The announcement comes days after UConn's leading scorer, sophomore Jeremy Lamb, announced that they too will be leaving for the NBA. The NCAA has banned UConn from next year's postseason because of past academic problems.
"Andre is a developing player with unlimited potential and their projected position in the draft is as good as almost any player I've ever had," UConn coach Jim Calhoun said. "Very few players get such a tremendous opportunity, and he's got to take advantage of it."
Drummond also led the team with 92 blocked shots, and their 2.7 blocks per game ranked third in the Big East.
McDonald's Japan has released their Pikachu McFlurry today. The limited edition treat mimics the electric mouse's iconic colors and is a delicious chocolate and banana mix. Of course we ran out to buy some as soon as we got to work this morning. You know, for science.
Yay!
There are 6 different cups that you can capture, and each one features Pikachu's adorable mug making a different facial expression. We bolted to our local McDonald's and picked up three McFlurries – each with a different Pikachu pose.
“Why are you eating my brains?”
The summer dessert arrives just in time for the release of “Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You”, which is the latest in the Pokémon Movie franchise. It also commemorates the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon anime in Japan. Can you believe it's been 20 years!?
Prior to the release of the chocolate and banana dessert, McDonald's Japan asked fans to vote for the flavour they wanted on Twitter.
Pikachu (banana & chocolate)
Charmander (habanero) -huh?-
Bulbasaur (broccoli) -ugh!-
Squirtle (Ramune soda)
Gengar (sweet potato)
Jigglypuff (peach).
Some of the flavours were clearly meant as jokes. Ultimately (and unsurprisingly), fans chose Pikachu.
Sadly the world missed out on the Broccoli ice cream
The McFlurry is available at McDonald's in Japan from July 14th into August. They're a great way to beat the Tokyo summer heat, so hurry up and catch 'em all!
Archangel Metatron told Santana to Collab with Pop Stars?!? Interesting
I don't even know what's going on any more...
We all know that Carlos Santana was into some stuff back in the day. They used to eat copious amount of psychedelics and meditate a lot. Heck, I do both of those still to this day. Who doesn't? Big whoop.
But Santana was also running around with John McLaughlin trying to assure the world that Guru Sri Chimnoy was in fact God. They even wrote songs about it, such as Guru's Song and Guru Sri Chinmoy Aphorism. That's not where the weirdness stops, not by a long shot.
The Angel Metatron
Let me introduce you to Santana's homeboy, the angel Metatron...
So apparently one time during their meditations in 1994, Santana was taken over by a transcendental spirit. They were made to grab a yellow legal pad and start automatic writing whatever they were channeling from this being.
"It's kind of like a fax machine"
Turns out it was this New Age character named The Archangel Metatron, who can heal you with their love through the transmissions of the spiritual radio. And it was to be Santana's mission to re-broadcast this spiritual radio to the children of the world.
"I'm not Carlos anymore. I'm not bound to DNA anymore."
Metatron told Santana explicitly, "You will be inside the radio frequency for the purpose of connecting the molecules with the light."
They knew what that meant. It meant they were to set out and finally record some new material, but it wouldn't make up just any album.
"Metatron is the architect of physical life."
What kind of album would this be? Well, Santana explained it to Rolling Stone in 1999 during an interview...
“I know it sounds New Age... but in my meditation, this entity - which is called Metatron - they said, 'we want to hook you back to the radio airwave frequency. We want you to reach junior high schools, high schools and universities. Once you reach them - because we are going to connect you with the best artists of the day - then we want you to present them a new menu. Let them know that they are themselves, multidimensional spirits with enormous possibilities and opportunities. We want you to present them with a new form of existence that transcends religion, politics or the modus operandi of education today'” – Rolling Stone, Summer, 1999
So the game was not only to release an album, but an album that would go beyond all human social structure altogether... Enter Supernatural.
Santana's Supernatural Album
Here's the creepy part. This mofo hadn't been on the charts in any serious way for over a decade or longer. It just wasn't popping off for him. But Metatron had the solution. As you read above, Santana was told to connect with the pop stars of the day.
Basically it was their spiritual mission to sell out as hard as possible. And it worked.
Santana went out and scored collaborations with artists including, but not limited to:
Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty
Lauryn Hill
CeeLo Green
Dave Matthews
Everlast
Eric Clapton
In 1999, this heater slammed straight up the charts. It went 15 times Platinum! It won the frickin' Album of the Year at the Grammy's plus eight other Grammy Awards. It even scored three Latin Grammy's including Record of the Year. It has sold over 30 million copies and took the number one spot on the charts in ten countries.
Maybe there's something to this whole Metatron business...
Included on the album was this smash hit with Rob Thomas, called Smooth:

I mean, you can't say that the song isn't awesome and they aren't smart to slide themselves back into relevancy like this. I don't think they achieved their goal of launching humanity into the 4th Density or whatever, but they made a boatload of money.
Happily Ever After
The flame of love hasn't extinguished. Three albums later, the record Shape Shifter would include a track named after and dedicated to Metatron.
You know, I'd heard of guys going down to the Crossroads and selling their soul to Satan for some rock and roll fame, but this is some next level shizz. Santana went too deep. Even Morpheus was like "nah, I can't follow you there, brah."
As those who watched the 1999 documentary called The Matrix know, we are all, in fact, trapped in a computer simulation, created by machines to keep our minds docile so that they can harvest our body heat for energy.
While many who saw the film began to re-prioritize their lives and ask if they wanted to escape from the machine and enter a dystopian future, here at Centives it got us thinking: what are the server capacity requirements of running the Matrix?
We're still working on that, but until then we've found some fascinating things about the sophisticated computer software that's guiding our lives. Here we look at the amount of data generated by the Matrix.
The human mind processes about 108 bits of data every second. This comes out to 12 megabytes a second – about the size of four high quality music files. For the illusion created by The Matrix to be as convincing as it is, the software must feed that much data into our minds, or else our brains might use any spare operating capacity that we have to do things like question why there's a persistent green tint to the world around us.
Scaled up this means that in a single year The Matrix must feed almost 360 terabytes of data into our brains to keep up the ruse. It would require 16,000 standard single layer Blu-Ray discs to store this data.
But all of this is just for one human being. It's not entirely clear how many humans are plugged into the Matrix, with the war that preceded the formation of the Matrix widely believed to have significantly thinned our population. Since then however our machine overlords have had ample time to ‘harvest' new crops of humans and at one point Agent Smith says that there are “Billions” of people plugged in.
So let's just assume that there are 7 billion people – the current population of our simulated planet – plugged into this dream world. Each person perceives the world in a slightly different way and so must be fed an entirely separate stream of data. Some simple multiplication tells us then that in a single year The Matrix produces 2.28 Yottabytes of data.
Laid end to end the number of Blu-Ray discs required to store this data would get you all the way to Pluto…and back!
Which leaves us with just one message for our evil machine overlords: Brilliant job.
Really.
We're not quite sure how you managed to figure this out, but it must have required a remarkable amount of effort on your part. We're really quite proud that the machines we created to clean up after us have managed to make such strides in data compression/storage technology.
…Now if you could just upgrade our programming so that we have access to Tomahawk Cruise Missiles, we'd really appreciate it, thanks. There's still that thing from that time at that place we need to take care of.
Centives erroneously reported in the original article that the number of Blu-Rays produced for the entire human population would reach Saturn if they were stacked on top of each other. This is not true. Apologies.
Agent Iain Hutchinson, who despite having had several clips of ammo emptied into them by the editors at Centives, asks that we state we ‘volunteered' to write this article based on an idea they had. If you liked it, then you might also be interested in other articles we've been coerced into writing including the cost of Building a Death Star, and the number of people that Pocahontas saved.

With each new year comes new laws. Around 40,000 new laws, regulations, and resolutions were approved by state legislatures in 2013, most of which will go into effect on January 1.
Here's a compilation of new state laws for 2014:
Arkansas: Voters must now show a photo ID at polling places.
California: Students must be allowed to play school sports and use school bathrooms “consistent with their gender identity,” regardless of their birth identity. CA will also become the first state requiring websites to tell users how they track, and share, personal information. And, the state raised minimum wage to $9 an hour (this takes effect in July).
Colorado: 16-year-olds will be able to pre-register to vote, but must still wait until they're 18 to actually vote. The state also will allow buyers over 21 to purchase marijuana at licensed retail dispensaries.
Connecticut: All assault weapons and large capacity magazines must be registered, and lawmakers voted to raise the minimum wage between 25 and 75 cents to $8.70.
Delaware: The state will limit patient copays for “specialty tier” prescription drugs to $150 a month for up to a 30-day supply (how this will work under Obamacare has not been clarified). The state has also joined the ever-growing list of those that no longer allow the possession, sale, or distribution of…shark fins.
Illinois: If you live in this state, pay attention – there are a lot of interesting new laws going into effect:
Websites will no longer be allowed to post mug shots and then ask for money to take them down.
Anyone under 18 will be banned from using tanning salons in the state.
Illinois has also passed a “lemon pet” law that will allow the return of a pet or be reimbursement for veterinary costs if an illness was not disclosed by the seller.
If you flick a cigarette butt on a street or sidewalk in the state, you could be fined at least $50 for littering.
Police in Illinois will be required to receive training on the psychological and physiological effects of stun guns.
Tougher penalties for inciting a violent flash mob or riot via social media were passed.
Illinois also becomes the 13th state to prohibit handheld cellphones while driving.
School districts will be able to install cameras on school buses to photograph drivers who pass them when buses are stopped.
School-based sex education will have to include information about both abstinence and contraception.
Illinois has also enacted two new laws regarding unmanned aerial drones. One prohibits them from interfering with hunters and fisherman, in response to the controversial People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals group's declaration that it would use drones to monitor hunters. The other prohibits the use of drones by law enforcement without a warrant.
Maryland: Immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who can provide evidence of a filed state income tax return or were claimed as a dependent for each of the preceding two years will be able to obtain a state driver's license or identification card.
Nevada: Immigrants living in the U.S. illegally can apply for driver authorization cards starting Jan. 2. State officials expect tens of thousands of people to apply under the program.
New York: The state's new gun law will require legal owners of weapons now classified as assault weapons to register them by April 15.
Oregon: This state passed perhaps the most unusual law for 2014 – along with their newborns, new mothers will now be allowed to bring home their placentas from the hospital too.
The state is requiring privately run websites that feature police mug shots to take down photos for free if subjects can show they were not guilty or that charges were dropped.
Adults will be prohibited from smoking in a car if children are present, and minors will be banned from tanning salons.
Employers and schools can't require a job or student applicant to provide passwords to social media accounts.
Rhode Island: Employers will be prohibited from requiring job applicants to state if they have a criminal record on a job application.
Virginia: Voters will be able to register online.

Overwhelming majority believe they are living with the effects of warming and 46% say coal-fired power should be phased out
Climate change: 90% of rural Australians say their lives are already affected
Ninety per cent of people living in rural and regional Australia believe they are already experiencing the impacts of climate change and 46% believe coal-fired power stations should be phased out, according to a new study.
A poll of 2,000 people conducted by the Climate Institute found that 82% of respondents in rural and regional Australia and 81% of those in capital cities were concerned about increased droughts, flooding and destruction of the Great Barrier Reef due to climate change, and 78% of all respondents were concerned there would be more bushfires.
About three quarters of all respondents – 76% in capital cities and 74% in rural or regional areas – said ignoring climate change would make the situation worse and about two-thirds said they believed the federal government should take a leading role.
However, only a third of respondents said the federal government should be contributing to action on climate change.
Instead, two-thirds, (67% in capital cities and 71% in regional areas) said individuals should be contributing to action on climate change and about half said state and local governments and businesses should be contributing to action on climate change.

The majority of people – 59% in capital cities and 53% in regional areas – said solar was their preferred energy source, followed by wind and hydro.
Only 3% of respondents in the city and 4% in regional areas said coal was their preferred energy source.
Nicky Ison, the director of the Community Power Agency, which represents 80 grassroots groups, said the results showed that concern about climate change was not limited to inner-city suburbs.
“I think there's a misconception that concern is mainly held in the city and I think there are some strong voices, particularly in rural and regional Australia, that have exaggerated or stoked that misconception,” Ison said.
“A vocal minority gets a lot of traction, probably because they have a greater access to megaphones.”
Matthew Charles-Jones is a co-president of Totally Renewable Yackandandah, a community-run initiative that aims to make the small town, 300km north-east of Melbourne, entirely run on renewable power by 2022.
Charles-Jones said the group was motivated by energy security and rising electricity costs but members were also concerned about the effects of climate change.
“We have been threatened by bushfire roughly every three years for the last decade,” they said.
The last bushfire was in December 2015. “It's very real for us in Yackandandah,” Charles-Jones said.
The novice White House candidates have every reason to be pleased with their current standing, but they nevertheless find themselves at a crossroads, The Amateur Trio of Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina – who, between them, have zero days of experience in public office – have done well enough in the cycle's opening round to claim first-tier status.
And while it's challenging for any national candidate to maintain that status, it's especially difficult for someone who's literally never won an election.
For a candidate like Fiorina, the goal appears to be demonstrating – to voters, to donors, to potential endorsers, et al – that she's the real deal. They may have struggled badly in the private sector, and they may have failed in their only other bid for public office – Fiorina lost a Senate campaign in 2010 in their home state by double digits – but the Republican is eager to prove that she's a legitimate presidential contender anyway.
Brazen dishonesty is likely to make that task far more difficult.
Carly Fiorina on Sunday stood by their disputed description of a scene from the videos targeting Planned Parenthood, but refused to say definitively that Republicans should force a government shutdown to defund the organization. “Not at all. That scene absolutely does exist, and that voice saying what I said they were saying – “We're gonna keep it alive to harvest its brain – exists as well,” Fiorina said on NBC's “Meet the Press.” […] In a testy exchange with host Chuck Todd, Fiorina repeatedly insisted that the practice they described “is happening.”
Except, it's not. She's still lying.
Look, I don't want to belabor the point. Fiorina made a very specific claim in the most recent GOP debate and that claim wasn't true . Since then, they and their aides have repeated the lie, over and over again, pretending fiction is fact. ABC offered Fiorina a chance to clarify, but they refused , sticking to the falsehood. Then Fox News pressed the Republican to acknowledge reality, and Fiorina refused again
Yesterday, NBC's Chuck Todd broached the subject, and once again , Fiorina couldn't – or wouldn't – concede the truth.
Evidently, Fiorina just doesn't care. They obviously realize – since the question keeps coming up – that media professionals know she's not telling the truth, and the GOP candidate has had plenty of opportunities to say they misspoke.
But she's stubbornly committed to the falsehood.
It's only natural to wonder whether this matters in electoral terms. The controversy surrounding Fiorina's demonstrable dishonesty has had no discernible effect on their support within the party, so perhaps the Republican candidate's lie will be inconsequential?
Maybe, but at this phase of the race, it's a dangerous time for a presidential hopeful to develop a reputation for being dishonest – and that's precisely what's happening with Fiorina.
Slate, for example, published a piece on Friday explaining , “Even if you like to take your facts on some kind of sliding scale, Fiorina's Big Lie is beyond appalling.”
It's the exact opposite of what a candidate in Fiorina's position needs right now, and it's a burden they brought entirely upon herself.
Priest claims schoolgirl Emanuela Orlandi was kidnapped for Vatican sex parties BelfastTelegraph.co.uk A Catholic priest has claimed a missing schoolgirl was kidnapped for Vatican sex parties and has implicated diplomatic staff and members of the Holy See. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/priest-claims-schoolgirl-emanuela-orlandi-was-kidnapped-for-vatican-sex-parties-28752725.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/migration_catalog/article25840880.ece/a3ad2/AUTOCROP/h342/World%20News%208-1.jpg

A Catholic priest has claimed a missing schoolgirl was kidnapped for Vatican sex parties and has implicated diplomatic staff and members of the Holy See.
Italian priest Gabriel Amorth, 85, said girls were recruited for parties at the Vatican and said the death of 15-year-old Emanuela Orlandi, last seen alive in 1983, “was a crime with a sexual motive”.
The priest spoke out last week as investigators broke into the grave of a known gang boss in Rome following an anonymous tip that the key to Emanuala's disappearance would be “found there”.
But so far bones which do not belong to mobster Enrico De Pedis, have not been positively identified as the girl's.
In an interview with La Stampa newspaper, Father Amorth said: “It has already previously been stated by (deceased) monsignor Simeone Duca, an archivist at the Vatican, who was asked to recruit girls for parties with the help of the Vatican gendarmes.
"The network involved diplomatic personnel from a foreign embassy to the Holy See. I believe Emanuela ended up a victim of this circle,"
Father Gabriele Amorth was appointed by the late John Paul II as the Vatican's chief exorcist.
Emanuela Orlandi disappeared after leaving their family's Vatican City apartment to go to a music lesson in Rome. Them father was a lay employee of the Holy See.
Four years ago, Italian news reports quoted the dead mobster's former lover as telling Rome prosecutors that criminals from the city's crime syndicate, known as the Magliana gang, had kidnapped the girl and had their body dumped in a cement mixer near a beach outside the capital.

At the 1961 Greater Greensboro Open, Charlie Sifford's appearance marked the first time a black man had ever been in the field of a PGA Tour event in the South. Playing at Sedgefield Country Club, they held the lead after a first-round 68.
Sifford had made their name in the predominantly black United Golf Association, but now they were the leading figure in the effort spurred by an emerging civil rights movement to end the PGA's Caucasians-only policy, which had stood formally since 1934.
In 1960, the 38-year-old Charlotte, North Carolina, native had played 20 tournaments on the PGA Tour with an Approved Tournament Player status, the first black golfer to be granted that rank.
In 2004, Charlie Sifford became the first African-American to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. The PGA of America/Getty Images
Jim Crow laws forbade them from getting a room at most of the city's hotels, so they stayed first in a dorm room at the all-black North Carolina A&T and then at the home of a local black family.
On the night before the second round, Sifford received a threatening phone call.
"You'd better not bring your black ass out to no golf course tomorrow if you know what's good for you, n-----," said the white man with the Southern accent. "We don't allow no n-----s on our golf course."
Sifford did arrive for their 10:15 a.m. tee time the next day, despite fears that their life was in danger. For the first 14 holes, they were taunted by a pack of 12 white men who were shouting racial obscenities.
"Go back to the cotton fields," they said. "Hey, boy, carry my bag."
Eventually, police would haul the men off the golf course.
Sifford, who shot a 1-over 72 in that tumultuous second round, would ultimately finish in a tie for fourth in the tournament.
"I knew that if I blew up, it would all be over," Sifford recalled years later in their autobiography, "Just Let Me Play." "I couldn't solve anything by violence. It would just ensure that all blacks, beginning with me, would be permanently barred from the tour.
"I just had to learn to handle it, because for all I knew, this would happen wherever I went to play golf in the South. They rattled me, for sure, but I survived."
For that perseverance, courage and restraint against seemingly insurmountable odds to desegregate the PGA Tour, Sifford will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in a reception Nov. 24 at the White House.
At 92, Sifford, who became the first black golfer to earn a full PGA Tour card when the Caucasian-only clause was lifted in November 1961, has been honored widely within the golf world.
Editor's Picks Sifford to receive nation's top civilian honor The White House announced Monday that Charlie Sifford, the first black golfer to join the PGA Tour, will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
In 2004, the two-time tour winner was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.  They are the recipient of an honorary degree from the University of St. Andrews, the birthplace of golf. In 2007, Sifford received the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America's highest honor, the Old Tom Morris Award.
Yet the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which only two other golfers have ever received -- Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer -- is recognition of Sifford's seminal contribution to broader American society during a time when politics, culture and sport were all converging on the nation's sordid racist past.
There was Sifford, a cigar-chomping family man with an indefatigable love for golf and a desire to earn a living through the game, in the middle of the struggle for freedom and equal rights for African-Americans. The golf course was their battleground, not the streets of Selma, Memphis or Birmingham.
Sifford did not set out to be a pioneer. For him, this award has to be as much a reminder of their disappointments as it is of their achievements. No award can make up for the entrenched racism in the game that kept them off the PGA Tour during their prime playing years and out of many of the top events, including the Masters.  They are not without bitterness.
Perhaps on a personal level, this honor may provide a satisfying coda for Sifford on their long life. Surely they couldn't have fathomed 50 years ago that they would live to see a black president. In many ways, Barack Obama is part of Sifford's legacy, as are the thousands of black athletes who have benefited from their courageous service.
Long after Obama puts the medal around their neck, Sifford will continue to live in each of us who ever dared to claim a space where somebody said we didn't belong simply because of the color of our skin.
There would not be a Tiger Woods without Sifford. And without Tiger, the game would not be as popular as it is around the world.
Yet, regardless of our race, nationality or proximity to the story of the integration of golf, we all owe Sifford a profound debt of gratitude for contributing their humble portion to making the game more inclusive and diverse.
We are all their children and should be thankful that they didn't respond to that Greensboro mob with anger and violence. By continuing to play, Sifford helped to ensure a brighter future for the game and the United States.
The appeal of one of Osama bin Laden's top aides ended Tuesday, as the Supreme Court declined to review whether their conviction by a military tribunal exceeded that body's authority.
Without comment, the justices turned down an appeal by Ali Hamza Ahmad Suliman al-Bahlul, a propagandist for al-Qaeda and a former media secretary for bin Laden. In 2008, they were convicted of conspiracy by a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and sentenced to life in prison.
Attorneys for Bahlul claimed that the Yemeni man's conviction violated a constitutional requirement that most criminal prosecutions take place in federal courts. The charge against Bahlul was a domestic one, not a violation of international law.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has debated the powers of the military tribunal system since the Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that those held at Guantanamo Bay have some rights in federal courts to challenge their detention.
Constitutional and international law experts and civil rights groups had joined Bahlul's attorneys in urging the justices to take the case, saying it raised constitutional questions only the Supreme Court could answer.
But the court has steadfastly refused requests to take a case that would amplify its ruling in Boumediene v. Bush.
Bahlul, who has been held at Guantanamo Bay since 2002, was originally convicted of conspiracy to commit war crimes, solicitation of others to commit crimes and providing material support for terrorism.
Only the conspiracy charge remained, however, and the circuit court split in upholding that conviction.
Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote for several other judges to say that Congress may designate military commissions to try domestic offenses typically heard by civilian courts.
"The Constitution does not give foreign nations (acting through the international law of war or otherwise) a de facto veto over Congress's determination of which war crimes may be tried by U.S. military commissions," they wrote in an opinion joined by Judges Janice Rogers Brown and Thomas B. Griffith.
Other judges, endorsing more limited legal reasoning, joined to make a six-member majority to uphold the conviction.
In a 67-page dissent, three judges said that there are "constitutionally prescribed boundaries" between military and civilian courts and that the prosecution could have instead charged Bahlul with recognized war crimes or charged them in federal court.
Judges David S. Tatel, Judith W. Rogers and Cornelia T.L. Pillard said in their dissent that even though Bahlul has admitted to ­serving as bin Laden's personal secretary and making al-Qaeda recruitment videos, the "challenges of the war on terror do not necessitate truncating the judicial power to make room for a new ­constitutional order."
A ruling against the government would have made it more difficult to prosecute low-level detainees at Guantanamo Bay.
The Supreme Court gave no reason for not accepting Bahlul v. United States, and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch took no part.

Football fans from this generation will be talking about offensive players like Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Calvin Johnson, Randy Moss, LaDainian Tomlinson and Adrian Peterson when theyâ€™re older. The good olâ€™ days will feature clips of Tom Bradyâ€™s game-winning drives, Peyton Manningâ€™s uncanny ability to get the ball in tight windows and Randy Mossâ€™ ridiculous leaping grabs.
But shouldn't we talk about Tony Gonzalez, too?
Gonzo played in pads for the final time in yesterdayâ€™s Pro Bowl, leaving behind the best tight end career the NFL has ever seen. Though their retirement does feel a little like the movie Groundhog Day, it appears as though this is for real â€“ Tony Gonzalez is done playing professional football.
He's made a name for themselves - that's for sure - but perhaps the not-so-flashy tight end position is the reason we don't talk about them more. Or maybe itâ€™s because they never made it to the Super Bowl, usually playing with teams that weren't built for a significant run. Whatever the case, Tony Gonzalez deserves even more respect that the majority of folks give him. Here are nine reasons why.
1. They missed just two games in 17 years.
Gonzalez made it a mission to take good care of their body, and as a result, they were almost always on the gridiron. Retiring at 37 years old, the league has seen Tony Gonzalez on a football field during all but two Sundays since 1997. In an athletic tight end era with injuries occurring almost weekly, this canâ€™t be overlooked: Tony Gonzalez is a freak of nature.
2. Their average Reception Net Expected Points total was over 87.00 since 2000.
At numberFire, we look at a metric called Net Expected Points when evaluating players. In essence, it looks at down and distance as well as game situations to see how a player actually helped (or hurt) their team (to read more about the metric, click here).
Gonzalez averaged a little over an 87.00 Reception NEP score since the year 2000. Essentially, they contributed 87 real points on theirs catches (only their catches, not all targets) each year. To give that some context, thatâ€™s better than what Larry Fitzgerald, a top wide receiver in the league, mind you, did in 2013.
3. That number was over 90.00 once they turned 30.
Whatâ€™s even crazier about Gonzoâ€™s efficiency is that their Reception NEP got better when they turned 30 years old. Again, for some context, Jason Witten has hit the 90.00 Reception NEP mark once in their entire career. Meanwhile, Tony Gonzalez averaged that score for eight (old) seasons.
4. Gonzalez has over 400 receptions more than any other tight end in league history.
Gonzalez compiled 1,325 receptions over the course of their career, while Jason Witten, second in the category, has 879. Witten will probably play a few more years in the league, but to get to Gonzoâ€™s level, heâ€™ll have to average around at least 100 receptions a season, which is unlikely given their age. Again, this can be credited to Gonzalez's unbelievable ability to stay healthy.
5. And they also have over 5,000 more yards than any other tight end.
Gonzoâ€™s 15,127 receiving yards total is over 5,000 more than Shannon Sharpe, who barely got over the 10,000 yard mark during their career. In other words, no tight end has put up more than 66% of Tony Gonzalezâ€™s receiving yards total.
6. Gonzalez caught 50 or more passes in 16 seasons, second only to Jerry Rice.
Not only is Rice a receiver, which inherently brings more targets, but Gonzalez accomplished this feat in every single season after their rookie year. And since 2003, Gonzo had exactly zero seasons with fewer than 70 receptions. Only six tight ends caught at least 70 balls this year, and Gonzalez did this every year since 2003!
7. There have been 32 1,000-yard receiving seasons from tight ends. Tony Gonzalez has four of them.
Thatâ€™s right â€“ one out of every eight 1,000-yard tight end seasons belongs to Tony Gonzalez. Only Jason Witten has hit this mark as many times, and only eight tight ends have even had multiple 1,000-yard seasons.
8. They have more than double the amount of touchdowns as the number five tight end touchdown leader.
Gonzalez caught 111 touchdowns over their 17-year career, which is 24 touchdowns more than the second place Antonio Gates. Moreover, Wesley Walls, the fifth-ranked tight end in terms of touchdowns, scored 54 times, which is less than half of Gonzoâ€™s touchdown total.
9. Gonzalez was a top-three fantasy tight end in 10 different seasons.
Last but not least, for you fantasy folks out there, we can't forget that Gonzo was the one consistent piece at the always-volatile tight end position through the years. In fact, they were so good that they were a top-three standard-scoring option in 10 of their 17 fantasy football seasons. Moreover, there was a stretch between 1999 and 2004 where Gonzalez was either the best or second-best tight end each year. Compared to the rest of their peers, they were arguably better than what weâ€™re seeing from some of the elite tight ends in todayâ€™s game.
A prominent Black Lives Matter activist in St. Louis was arrested in April and faces charges of human trafficking and prostitution against a 17-year-old girl. The activist, Charles Wade, said in a statement that they were helping the girl, who they believed to be 20, obtain temporary housing.
Wade runs Operation Help or Hush, a charity that says it provides housing, food assistance and other forms of direct aid to both activists and local residents in general. Conservative news site The Daily Caller appears to have been the first to run a story about their arrest, but copies of the police report were also circulated on Twitter and on Love B Scott.
The report says Wade was arrested during an undercover sting, after vice officers answered an ad on Backpage.com and met the girl at a hotel room, where they told them a half-hour session would be $100. When they identified themselves as a police officer, the report says, they fled into a hallway. The police report says a man was observed “watching” the undercover officer as they entered the hotel room, and that after they were arrested, the woman identified them as “my manager.”
The report says that the woman told police during an interview that Wade posted the Backpage ads themselves and collected the profits; they also claimed they told her, “You only have five months until you're 18 so I'm not worried.”
Wade issued the statement on Twitter, where they said they were asked in April to “temporarily house, for under a week, a woman who I was told was 20 years old.” They say they were told they were awaiting a replacement ID card and some monthly benefits.

Wade also says in their statement that the woman was arrested for prostitution soon after they booked them into a hotel room. They didn't directly address the allegations they apparently made in their interview, calling them their “manager.”
“Hindsight is 20/20 and in my desire to help them as they were displaced, I did not protect myself,” Wade writes, “As I did not know them or their prior behavior other than substance abuse that I was told they had ‘kicked.'”

The police report states that Wade was arrested with three phones, which police say they believe were used in “furthering criminal activity.”
MIAMI — Just when Wayne Ellington was starting to find a rhythm, he's out with another injury.
Ellington is expected to miss their second consecutive game because of a strained right hamstring on Tuesday when the Heat (9-19) host the Magic. The 29-year-old suffered the injury in the third quarter of Friday's loss to the Clippers.
“He did a workout [Monday], but they didn't do anything on the court,” coach Erik Spoelstra said Monday. “I don't anticipate he'll play tomorrow, but we'll still have them day-to-day.”
Along with Ellington, guard Rodney McGruder is questionable for Tuesday's game after re-aggravating a sprained left ankle. McGruder is one of just three Heat players — Hassan Whiteside and Udonis Haslem are the other two — who has not missed a game due to an injury this season, while Ellington has already missed 17 games due to injury.
Ellington was forced to miss the first 16 games of the season with a right thigh contusion, but he's optimistic this latest injury won't keep them out as long. Spoelstra described it as a “slight strain” and Ellington described it as a “mild strain.”
“I think I'm being more cautious than anything,” Ellington said. “It's not something that I'm in a great deal of pain or anything like that. It's just something I felt in the third quarter of the Clippers game. I went to make a sharp cut. I was playing defense. And I just felt a little pain in a certain area in my hamstring.”
In the 11 games Ellington has played in this season, he's averaged 12.9 points and shot 32.5 percent from 3-point range. He's made eight starts.
With Chris Bosh, Dion Waiters and Ellington not expected to play against the Magic on Tuesday, the Heat will likely have — at most — 12 players available. If McGruder can't play, Miami will have 11 players available.
Twelve Heat players (including Chris Bosh) have combined to miss 111 games due to injuries over the first 28 games of the season.
“We've been a little injury plagued, but it's not an excuse for us,” Ellington said. “We've got a lot of guys at a lot of positions. So, it's always the next man up. We'll give other people opportunities and we just have to take advantage of it. I'm sure when we get everybody out there healthy we'll be able to show what we can do together.”

Arab League Secretary General Calls for ‘Special Criminal Court' for Israel
Outgoing Arab League Secretary General Nabil El-Arabi called for a special criminal court to be established for Israel, reported Agence France Presse.
The call for a special criminal court, in the same vein as ones set up for Serbian war crimes, is needed to ensure Israel is no longer “above the law and accountability”, said El-Arabi at the Arab League's emergency meeting in Cairo.
El-Arabi raised the issue during an emergency meeting held to discuss Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent statements that the Golan Heights would remain in Israeli control “forever”. The Golan Heights were captured by Israel during the 1967 war and annexed in 1981. Internationally, the Golan Heights continue to be recognized solely as Syrian.
Following the Israeli Prime Minister's controversial calls, Egypt's Foreign Ministry said that it would be a violation of the principles of international law and numerous UN resolutions passed in both the Security Council and the General Assembly. In a similar vein, the United States of America said that it does not recognize the Golan Heights to be part of Israel.
Taking a harsher stance, Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the Arab League in Cairo said that Israel, a “Zionist entity”, is attempting to “exploit years of conflict in Syria”.
Nevertheless, Israel remains steadfast, with the Israeli Prime Minister recently telling the Russian President that the Golan Heights is a “red line” and must remain a part of Israel.

Among the messages Attorney General Eric Holder had for graduates of Morgan State University this weekend was this one: Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' views on race and politics are misguided.
What the graduates may not know is that this is simply the latest volley between the administration of President Obama and Roberts' Supreme Court.

Holder was the historically black school's commencement speaker on Saturday, using the opportunity to discuss how American racial politics have evolved in the precisely sixty years since the Brown v. Board of Education decision. "Chief Justice John Roberts has argued that the path to ending racial discrimination is to give less consideration to the issue of race altogether," Holder said, referring to Roberts' majority opinion in a 2007 ruling that scaled back diversity programs in local schools. But, Holder continued, "discrimination does not always come in the form of a hateful epithet or a Jim Crow-like statute. And so we must continue to take account of racial inequality, especially in its less obvious forms, and actively discuss ways to combat it."
The administration and the Court have been at odds nearly since Obama was first sworn in — a swearing-in that, you might remember, required a do-over.
The Alito incident
At their State of the Union address in January 2010, Obama criticized the Court as it sat in the audience. Referring to the Citizens United decision, which removed certain prohibitions on campaign financing, Obama stated that the case would "open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections." Justice Samuel Alito, a member of the conservative bloc on the Court reacted visibly, mouthing "not true."
In an interview a few months later Roberts called Obama's critique "very troubling," given the surrounding environment. The annual speech, in the chief justice's estimation, had become little more than a "political pep rally." Experts that who spoke with The Post at the time agreed that Obama's comments were unusual. "I can't ever recall a president taking a swipe at the Supreme Court like that," University of Texas Supreme Court expert Lucas A. Powe Jr. said.
Obama wasn't done. In a 2012 interview with Rolling Stone, Obama criticized Roberts' majority opinion on the Affordable Care Act, which determined that the health care law could be upheld as a tax. Obama criticized that interpretation, suggesting that Roberts "made a decision that allowed them to preserve the law but allowed them to keep in reserve the desire, maybe, to scale back Congress' power" to regulate interstate commerce.
Court conservatives fight back
Both Roberts and other members of the Court have not been shy about their critiques of the president. During verbal arguments on the case that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, Roberts dismissed Obama's strategy on the law. "If they have made a determination that executing the law by enforcing the terms is unconstitutional," Roberts said, "I don't see why they don't have the courage of their convictions" and simply not enforce it. (The administration's lawyer's response? Obama continued to enforce the law "out of respect for the Congress that enacted the law and the president [Bill Clinton] who signed it.")
Oral arguments are not an unusual time for such critique to appear. Justice Antonin Scalia repeatedly challenged the government lawyers during the Obamacare case, as Bloomberg documented at the time. Scalia called the government's position in that case — that the law could be implemented under the interstate regulatory powers of the Commerce Clause — "extraordinary." During arguments on Arizona's controversial immigration law, Scalia asked the solicitor general if "we have to enforce our laws in a manner that will please Mexico."
Justice Clarence Thomas doesn't usually ask questions during oral arguments. But in an interview in April 2013, they criticized President Obama indirectly, as Fox Nation reported. "I've always thought there would be black coaches, heads of universities," Thomas said. "Maybe again as I said I'm naive but the thing I always knew is that it would have to be a black president who was approved by the elites and the media because anybody that they didn't agree with, they would take apart."
On particular issues, if not in personal terms, even liberal members of the Court have criticized the administration. When the Court debated Obama's 2012 recess appointments in January of this year, the liberals on the Court appeared to agree that Obama had overstepped their authority. (A decision in that case, NLRB v. Noel Canning, has not been released.)
Tension between the Court and the White House is a natural part of the constitutional separation of powers which Obama themselves referred to in their Citizens United critique that prompted Alito's visible frustration. It's the decorum that's generally seen as having eroded, from Scalia's temper to that Obama "pep rally." Of course, Alito and Roberts had reason to be frustrated with the president even before Obama was sworn in. When each was nominated to the bench, then-senator Obama voted against them.
Privacy may be one of the biggest casualties of the Digital Age. If it's not the government that's storing records of cellphone calls, it's advertisers tracking our every online clicks. While limiting government and corporate snooping is now a matter of heated debate, the notion of guarding intellectual privacy has yet to generate much fuss.
Yet, according to Neil Richards, this basic American value to "read and think freely without surveillance" is in peril. Without it, they said, we'll become less willing to test new ideas, challenge common assumptions, and engage in rigorous debate. I recently spoke to Mr. Richards, a professor of law at Washington University, about their new book, "Intellectual Privacy: Rethinking Civil Liberties in the Digital Age."
Edited excerpts follow.
Selinger: Is intellectual privacy something special that's only for intellectuals?
Richards: No, intellectual privacy is for anyone with an intellect – which is to say, it's for everyone. Intellectual privacy is about needing to have protections from being watched and interfered with when we're making up our minds about the world – when we're reading, surfing the Web, talking on the phone, and sending e-mail to confidants. It's a way of understanding why people get so annoyed when the government and companies monitor our lives, and it was perhaps the greatest interest threatened by the surveillance Edward Snowden leaked. Although intellectual privacy is incredibly important, the right hasn't been well understood. We didn't have to think about our beliefs, desires, and fantasies as matters of intellectual privacy until recently when we started interacting over digital devices that keep long and detailed records of our thoughts and reading habits.
Selinger: What makes intellectual privacy so important?
Richards: A free society needs citizens with free minds. But as the social science shows, we act differently when we're watched. We become boring, inoffensive, and mainstream. And this is true of our thoughts and beliefs as well as our actions. When we know we're being monitored, we might not click on a controversial link or discuss controversial views on politics or sexuality over the phone.
Selinger: Do you think intellectual privacy is currently being threatened?
Richards: Yes, companies and the government have so much control over our intimate information that people live in a state of perpetual uncertainty and sometimes fear.
Selinger: What's an example of us having less intellectual privacy than we deserve?
Richards: The NSA's assertion that it needs records of all telephone calls. I bet it would like to have the content of those calls and e-mail, too. The government has lost sight of the fact that free thought and expression are the most important values for democracy to preserve.
Selinger: Beyond government surveillance, is anything else undermining intellectual privacy?
Richards: Yes, corporations are. A few years ago Facebook offered “social reading” and automatically shared things we clicked on and read with our friends. People ended up accidentally disclosing embarrassing things. Amongst all the shame, the trend died a secret and unheralded death. But while this obvious case of intellectual privacy infringement is behind us, we're still stuck with the fuel that keeps Facebook and so many other companies going: Internet advertising.
Without any public debate, we've allowed a vast ecosystem of companies to increasingly profile and segment all of us into our reading habits and interests. We never had a discussion about whether the price of using the Internet should be widespread surveillance. If we could have had this debate early on about giving up access to our political beliefs and sexual activity, I'm sure we would have rejected the deal on those terms. We can have the Internet without surveillance of our minds, and we should insist on that now.
Selinger: Does this view of intellectual privacy justify placing new restrictions on data brokers?
Richards: Yes, we should have a federal Do Not Track law. People have a right not to be profiled when going online, and a legally enforced Do Not Track would make the Internet better – more secure and trustworthy. We should also treat records of reading, thinking, and communications with special, legally protected care.
Selinger: What about new modes of reading? Should an appreciation for intellectual privacy lead us to think differently about devices like Amazon's Kindle?
Richards: In the past, it was easy to ensure nobody knew what we read, how we read, and even if we read. Now by default the Kindle keeps detailed records of what we buy, browse, how long our mouse rests over a word and our eyes linger over a page, what pages we underline and what the most underlined pages are, whether we finish a book, whether we re-read a book, and what passages we re-read. Some of this data serves useful functions for readers. But it also creates a detailed portrait of Kindle users as readers that, hypothetically, could be disclosed or used in harmful ways. This isn't an entirely new problem. Librarians realized they had to know something about their patrons in order to be helpful. But they also knew that a deep ethical and professional obligation came with this knowledge. After some very good work by the American Library Association, librarians lobbied to have state laws passed protecting the confidentiality of their records. We don't have anything like that for Kindle or other digital bookstores even though we should.
Selinger: So, what kind of restrictions should be placed on companies like Amazon?
Richards: Amazon is sometimes pretty good about being transparent. But we should have general transparency rules that don't rely on the business incentives of companies, as well as rules about data use. Under current law Amazon is free to sell all of its sensitive data however it wants to, and to see why this is dangerous we only need to think about the recent Uber scandal where the company was said to be considering authorizing opposition research on the journalists who criticized it. Our intellectual privacy has real political ramifications and shouldn't just be left to the business incentives of companies.
Selinger: Do your views on intellectual privacy shed any light on the president's recent remarks “that police and spies should not be locked out of encrypted smartphones and messaging apps”?
Richards: The latest phase of the Snowden debate is an attack on encryption. Apple, for example, realizes it's good business to reassure users that their sensitive data is secure, and so now it encrypts the disks on iPhones and iPads. The government responds and basically says, “Hang on, this is a problem. We need to be able to access everything. There need to be backdoors.” This is the wrong position to take because intellectual privacy requires security. We have to be able to trust people with dangerous ideas. After all, most of our cherished ideas at some point were controversial, including the idea that all people are equal before the law. Encryption provides necessary safeguards by securing what we're thinking until we're ready to enter public debate. I should also note that backdoors make it easier for malicious hackers to access our information. Just think about what happened to Jennifer Lawrence and Sony.
Selinger: But what the opposing view that backdoors are not synonymous with unfettered government access and their use is constrained by due process, such as warrants?
Richards: We know from Snowden and others that very often due process in national security cases is minimal to non-existent, and better checks need to be in place than the ones we currently have. Also, encryption doesn't mean that government can't ever get access to information, any more than putting locks on a door means that nobody can break into a house. The government's response to this retort is that encryption makes it harder for law enforcement to do its job. But that's exactly the point of civil liberties like intellectual privacy. They introduce inefficiencies. You know where there are no inefficiencies? In a perfect police state! What we need is balance between freedom and security, and intellectual privacy – especially broad protections for the right to read and think freely without surveillance – must be a cherished part of that balance.

The family of Seth Rich, a murdered DNC staffer, has sharply criticized the conspiracy theories flying around the Internet about their death.
What does the evidence show? Washington D.C. police have said very little about the open homicide case. However, they did release to Heavy a police report on the death, which you can read above.
According to the New York Times, the Rich family is demanding retractions from Fox for recent reports on their son's death. Newsweek is reporting that the FBI is not investigating the Rich homicide.
Rich was a data analyst for the DNC.
Washington D.C. Metropolitan police public affairs told Heavy on August 9: “At this time, there is no indication that Seth Rich's death is connected to their employment at the DNC. However, we welcome information that could potentially lead to the identification of the individual(s) responsible for their death and are pleased when any outside contributors help us generate new leads.”
Rich, 27, who worked for the DNC on voting issues, was shot and killed in Washington D.C., and their murder remains mysterious. “Police have found little information to explain their death,” said The New York Daily News.
Conspiracy theories are raging about Rich's death because of their DNC employment and also the lack of an obvious motive, eyewitnesses, or suspect in the case, which has languished unsolved for a year.
Fox has now retracted a story on Rich and WikiLeaks, writing:
“On May 16, a story was posted on the Fox News website on the investigation into the 2016 murder of DNC Staffer Seth Rich. The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.
We will continue to investigate this story and will provide updates as warranted.”
Rich was shot on the street in July 10, 2016 at 4:15 in the morning near a Washington D.C. neighborhood where they lived, said CBS News. Some are also raising questions about the August death of Shawn Lucas, who served the DNC with a lawsuit alleging fraud in the presidential race.
However, Lucas' death was eventually labeled an accident as a result of a combination of drugs, including kratom.
In the Rich homicide case, The Washington Post wrote on July 11: “Police said they have no suspects, witnesses or motive, though they are looking at whether Rich could have been slain in an attempted robbery.”
NBC Channel 4 in Washington says that Seth's mother, Mary Rich, said previously that police “told their family their son may have been the victim of an attempted robbery.” In August, Mary joined police in a press conference in which they asked the public for help in providing tips.
However, the Rich family has also asked, through a spokesperson, that people stop politicizing the tragedy.
“The family welcomes any and all information that could lead to the identification of the individuals responsible, and certainly welcomes contributions that could lead to new avenues of investigation,” Rich family spokesperson Brad Bauman said in in a previous statement.
Rich's father told The Washington Post that Seth's watch, wallet and credit cards were not taken, but they believe that Rich was “killed after resisting a robbery in which the assailant got nothing.”
Daily Mail says Rich was attacked across the street from a convenience store on the 2100 block of Flagler Place NW, not far from a brownstone they shared with three or four roommates. Rich was from Omaha, “where their family played a strong role in the Beth El Synagogue,” said Daily Mail.
However, Acting Capt. Anthony Haythe of the Metropolitan Police Department's homicide branch said in a July news conference that all motives were being considered, said CBS. The New York Daily News quoted police as saying, “There is no immediate indication that robbery was a motive in the attack…but it has not been ruled out as a possibility.”
That's left Rich's murder mysterious.
The police said they are looking into whether Rich's death was tied to other robberies in the area, and their roommate told WUSA9 that Rich “was probably walking home from their girlfriend's apartment when they were robbed and then shot.” The Washington Post said there were two robberies “in the city in the hour preceding the shooting, both more than one mile away.”
The Rich family, in a statement published by NBC News, said it was a “family committed to facts” not “fake evidence.”
Rich's mother told NBC Channel 4 in Washington D.C. that their son's “hands were bruised, their knees are bruised, their face is bruised, and yet they had two shots to their back, and yet they never took anything.”
The Washington D.C. Medical Examiner's office told Heavy that Rich died from gunshot wound to the torso and the manner of death was homicide. The office did not say how many times Rich was shot and said that autopsy reports are not publicly released to the news media in D.C.
The Washington Post says at least one of Rich's multiple gunshot wounds was in the back. The shooting occurred in northwest Washington D.C.'s Bloomingdale neighborhood, said WUSA9. Rich was taken to the hospital, where they died, said WUSA9.
Rich was discovered by police who were patrolling the area and was conscious and breathing at first, said CNN. They were talking on the phone with their girlfriend when the shooting occurred and told them not to worry about it when they heard a noise, said NBC 4. There is a $25,000 reward being offered in the Rich murder case.
On their LinkedIn page, Rich described themselves as “Experienced and impassioned data analyst. I have an enormous interest in public service and working towards making the world a better place.” The page says that Rich had worked as the DNC's Voter Expansion Data Director since 2014.
Before that, they were a Research Data Associate for Greenberg Quinlan Rosner; a Boating Education Director and Staff Programming Director at Camp Ramah in Wisconsin; a research intern for Senator Ben Nelson; a member of the campaign staff for the Nebraska Democratic Party, an enumerator for the Census Bureau, a field organizer for Senate campaigns, and other jobs.
According to Town Hall, Rich had previously worked on the U.S. Senate campaign for Nebraska business person Scott Kleeb. “The Clinton Global Initiative provided funds for a clean energy business started by Kleeb, which had come under investigation after losing $300,000 in 2010 and another $300,000 in 2011 despite the subsidies,” asserted Town Hall, adding that “Rich was also previously employed at a data firm that had worked with the Clintons.”
A woman who showed up drunk to pick their children at a day care in Deltona was arrested, Volusia County deputies said.
A woman who showed up drunk to pick their children at a day care in Deltona was arrested, Volusia County deputies said.
A motorist called deputies to report that Lisa Vantunen, 45, was driving on the wrong side of Providence Boulevard and followed Vantunen to a day care at Faith Baptist Church. When deputies got to church at Providence Boulevard and Voyager Street, deputies found the vehicle with the door open and the engine running, a report shows.
Vantunen was seen exiting the day care with two small children and when deputies approached the vehicle, they found Vantunen pressing hard on the brakes trying to shift into gear, the report said.
When Vantunen stepped out of the vehicle, they stumbled and almost fell. Deputies also noticed that they had an abrasion on their knee and Vantunen told them they had fallen down when they got to the day care, deputies said.
Vantunen said they had been drinking all day Friday and smelled of alcohol, deputies said.
A day care worker was asked to care for the children until their grandmother, traveling from Port St. Lucie, could arrive, sheriff's investigators said.
The motorist who reported Vantunen said they kept falling asleep at intersections and swerving all over the road, almost hitting pedestrians. At one time, motorists had to honk their horns to wake them up, the witness told investigators.
A South Carolina representative raised questions Tuesday over whether the nine deaths from last week's Charleston, S.C., shooting could have been avoided if the victims had taken measures of self-defense.
State Rep. William Chumley (R) deflected questions from a CNN reporter over whether the confederate flag should be taken down, and wondered if some of the deaths could have been avoided if the churchgoers tried to thwart the gunman, Dylann Storm Roof.

“We are focusing on the wrong thing,” Chumley told the reporter. “These people sat in there and waited their turn to be shot. That's sad, when somebody in there with the means of self-defense could have stopped this, and would have fewer funerals than we're having.”
The state representative pressed on with the issue of self-defense, asking why “somebody didn't just do something.”
“You got one skinny person shooting a gun, we need to do what we can,” they said.
The reporter asked Chumley whether they thought someone should have tried to tackle or fight the gunman. Chumley did not offer their specific recommended strategy, although they implied the victims had time to think of ways to protect themselves.
“I don't know what the answer was, but I know it's really horrible for nine people to be shot,” they said. “I understand that they reloaded their gun during the process, that's upsetting.”

Everything is coming up Russia these days. Besides the hacking, influence and other shadiness, there is a distinctly Soviet propaganda tone to the Trump Administration. (Don't worry, I'm not beating the war drums for a fight with Russia, just making an observation or three.)
When the facts don't fit the Administration's spin, they go after the messenger. The media? “Enemy of the people.” CBO report doesn't jibe with what you want? It's a flawed and corrupt office that should be dismantled! Don't like a judge's ruling? He's a “so-called judge.” Good employment numbers? They were phony when applied to your despised predecessor but are “very real now.” Forget a war with Russia, I'm just worried about more techniques of a Soviet strongman working their way into our government.
In addition to Trumpian propaganda there is just plain cruelty in the new healthcare mix. Need to get premiums down? Just drive out the old and sick, wait for the health care pool to get younger and healthier and, presto! Your premiums will be lower in ten years or so! Here's to staying healthy and keeping up with the latest executive order, leak or rule change coming out of the White House. (Enjoy the cartoon and keep an eye on my work behind-the-scenes here on Patreon.)
The political and media establishments, who treat a genuine dissident like a man from Mars, are lecturing Iowans that if they choose the wrong person — e.g., someone those establishments haven't approved for them — they will “discredit” the Iowa caucuses. These are the same people who pretend to want to “spread democracy” around the world, remember.
What would discredit the caucuses would be a victory for any other candidate. It is not the job of Iowans, or anyone else, to rubber-stamp the choices the establishment has told them are acceptable and safe. It is their job to make up their own minds — and if that means telling the establishment to take a flying leap, then so be it.
A Ron Paul victory would prove that Iowans are done with letting the New York Times or Rush Limbaugh do their thinking for them. It would prove that they understand what may be the most important point in all of American politics: whenever someone comes along who refuses to play the game and might actually upset the apple cart, the entire establishment — from Sean Hannity and Mark Levin to the New York Times and Meet the Press — goes into Destroy mode.
And it would show that a substantial number of Americans are prepared to say: the more you smear, the more viciously you attack, the more obvious your venom for one particular man, the more we will rally to him. Since this is the only man who actually terrifies the crooks, the flip-floppers, the thought controllers, and the whole range of so-called respectable opinion, they are obviously the one to support.
The other theme these days is that Ron Paul is “dangerous.” They've got that right — he's dangerous to them. They threaten the whole bipartisan establishment. Remember that whenever you hear this Pravda-esque warning. To borrow a phrase from Bill Buckley, the propagandists fear Ron Paul for the same reason the baloney fears the slicer.
Shandalar Slivers: Theory and History Posted by Seth Weinstein on May 7, 2013 · 12 Comments
They're baaaaaaaaaaaaack.
In case you haven't heard, the much-loved/fiercely-hated creature tribe of Slivers is returning to the 2014 Core Set. The internet is already abuzz with discussion; they're humanoid now? And the abilities are one-sided? What's going on here?
I'm curious about that too, but as you may expect, what especially caught my eye was the lore. In the new Sliver card pictured to the right, we see flavor text from a Thunian scout. Thune, as you may recall, is a white-mana area in the plane of Shandalar. We've seen Shandalar before as the featured plane in Magic 2013, as well as the setting of a few MtG video games, but you know what we've never seen? We've never seen Slivers there.
Slivers are, as far as we know, native to Dominaria, the MtG “home plane” and the setting of the Brothers' War, the Phyrexian Invasion, the Mirari Saga, and parts of the Time Spiral storyline. In a nutshell, kind of big-deal-of-a-plane. Which is why it's surprising, especially in the year of Magic's 20th anniversary, to bring back Slivers without bringing back their crucially-important native plane.
(EDIT: As I have been informed multiple times, no one really knows where Slivers came from. It's possible they're simply native to Shandalar, and this whole article is useless! Regardless, Dominaria was the last place we saw them, so the question of “how would they escape?” is still relevant.)
How did they get to Shandalar? My speculative answer relies on some precedent set by powerful planeswalkers, the nature of the plane of Shandalar itself, and a little hand-waving courtesy of the Time Spiral plot. Let's begin.
Concerning Shandalar
In my research on this plane, I was looking for some sort of hint at the nature of planeswalking being fundamentally different here. I found no such thing, but there were a couple other traits that made me sit up and take notice. Shandalar, like Zendikar, is unusually rich in magical energy; your everyday citizen of the plane knows a handful of magical spells and is aware of the five colors of Magic. In addition, Shandalar is not fixed to a specific point in the Multiverse. Instead, it floats freely through the Blind Eternities, drifting here and there with no real path or purpose. As such, sometimes it comes precariously close to other planes, although it never goes as far as a full-scale Rathi Overlay.
So: mana-rich plane, without a fixed location. With me so far? Cool.
Breaking The Shard
After the devastating Brothers' War ended with Urza unleashing the Sylex Blast, a protective envelope began to form around Dominaria and a handful of other planes. The Shard of Twelve Worlds, as it was called, cut off these worlds from the rest of the Multiverse and was pretty convenient for the people inside it. Dominaria got majorly messed up by the Brothers' War, and it needed some time away from Urza and Yawgmoth to heal.
Unfortunately, things are never that easy, and the Sylex Blast that protected Dominaria from the aggressors also began the millennia-long Dominarian Ice Age. In an attempt to escape the Shard, the necromancer Lim-Dûl (left) hatched a plan. Lim-Dûl knew that the plane of Shandalar had wandered relatively close to Dominaria, and their plan was to escape to it using the energy released by the death of a Planeswalker. This was all pre-Mending, when Planeswalkers were still essentially gods, so it stands to reason that one could produce enough energy for a non-Walker to reach a relatively close plane.
Lim-Dûl's plan didn't go exactly as they intended, but that's a story for another time. The point is that it was established that with enough energy, and a close enough proximity between the planes, travel from Dominaria to Shandalar is possible.
The Time Spiral Catalyst
The last time we saw Slivers was in the Time Spiral block, which gives us the final piece of the puzzle. Namely, that Slivers were present during the time-and-space shenanigans that went down during that time.
After the Sylex Blast, the Ice Age, the Phyrexian Invasion, the War of the False God, and countless other apocalypses, Dominaria began to break apart at the seams. Holes opened up in space and time, allowing beings from other ages and planes passage to and from Dominaria. If ever there was going to be an opportunity for Slivers to slip into another plane, this would be it. Just the explosion created when the false god Karona was destroyed alone could possibly have been enough to send Slivers to Shandalar, provided the plane was close enough at the time. Otherwise, it's just a matter of a curious Sliver wandering past the right planar tear and thinking, “Hey… I smell mana.”
Final Notes on Evolution
Some people have been less-than-pleased with the new humanoid shapes Slivers are taking and the fact that their abilities only affect Slivers you control. As a flavor purist, I get where they're coming from. I like pointy-headed, one-clawed Slivers as much as the next guy, and I could see how their return might be tainted for some people by these flavor concerns.
However, never underestimate the fact that Slivers evolve, and have done so consistently every single time we've seen them. In the beginning, back when they were Rathi immigrants from Dominaria in the Tempest block, their evolution was accelerated by Volrath infiltrating their Hive and modifying some of them, which in turn made the other Slivers evolve to match them. We saw further evolution when they returned via the Riptide Project in Onslaught block, where the ripples of the Mirari's power sparked further evolution and produced the Sliver Overlord (right).
In their second return, during the chaos of the asupervisorstioned Time Spiral block, they were sentient enough to actively absorb the powers and appearances of other beings they deemed useful. Additionally, the Sliver hivemind itself slowly became sentient, forming the Sliver Legion.
The point is, Slivers have only become more and more powerful and adaptive since we've met them. Let's be real; the snakelike bodies and rigid adherence to the hivemind are cool, but after a while they stop holding up so well in battle. So, the Slivers evolve once again to the more convenient and expressive humanoid forms, and fine-tune their abilities so they only affect the Slivers they want to affect. Isn't nature great?
I can't wait to see the new Sliver cards, and I'm excited to find out if my theories on Multiverse travel and Sliver biology hold up to scrutiny when we get the official story. In the meantime, comment below on what the heck you think Slivers are doing on Shandalar!

Screenshot via YouTube Few things mix more poorly than commercial flying and the mainstream media.
Seldom is an aviation article free from some measure of distortion, exaggeration, or at times outright nonsense.
If you caught my post on the AirAsia crash, you're already aware of the pair of recent New York Times op-eds that couldn't get it right. But that's just for starters.
There are hardworking reporters out there who take the extra step to ensure their work is accurate, but they're the exception. I'm not saying it's an easy beat — aviation is a field brimming with jargon, stubborn mythology, and recalcitrant sources (that is, airline spokespeople), but sometimes it's as if they're not even trying. Especially when it comes to pictures. If only I had a dollar for every time an article or news segment was accompanied by incorrect or inappropriate photography.
For instance a TV spot about a particular airplane type, or a particular airline, is accompanied by footage showing a totally different plane or a totally different carrier. Or newspaper article about Airbus shows a picture of a Boeing; an article about Boeing shows an Airbus. And so on.
Here's one blooper that gets both the aircraft and the airline wrong. The story, carried last month by the Agence France-Presse (AFP), was about a US Airways Airbus A330 that diverted into Rome after several passengers became ill. The problem is [that it wasn't an] Airbus A330 and it [wasn't] US Airways. It was a much larger A380 in the colors of Qatar Airways. Not even close on either count.
Have you ever noticed, too, how any and every time a flight diverts somewhere or returns to its airport of origin, be it for a mechanical problem, medical issue, or anything else, the event is described as "an emergency landing"?
In fact, the vast majority of what are described as emergency landings are precautionary diversions or returns. Actual emergency landings are rare, and pilots do not employ the term nearly as loosely. The captain must specifically declare an emergency to air traffic control. Situations vary, but generally it pertains to a situation in which expedited air traffic control handling is requested, or aircraft status is uncertain. Even then, most emergencies aren't anything close to the life-or-death scenarios many passengers (or reporters) are prone to imagining.
AP
Another bad habit of reporters is describing virtually any portion of airport tarmac as a "runway." Taxiways, terminal ramps, etc., are commonly called "runways," when in fact they are not. I should hardly have to point this out, but a runway is a very specific thing with a very specific purpose: It's that long and clearly defined strip of pavement that a plane takes off from and lands on.
And while I hate to pile on, allow me to pile on …
I also have a problem with the media's reliance on aviation academics. It's customary for reporters to cite aviation professors, aerospace researchers, et al, in their stories. I understand the temptation here, and with certain topics these individuals offer valuable insights. But what reporters don't realize is that professors and researchers can be highly unfamiliar with the day-to-day operational aspects of commercial flying. This is not their expertise. If the topic is aerodynamics, meteorology, or something statistical, that's one thing. But for anything that touches the nitty-gritty of airline operations and the SOPs of flying jetliners, academics are often terrible sources.
And we haven't even gotten to Hollywood yet. Movies are the worst. The typical cockpit portrayal is beyond absurd, but half the time filmmakers can't even get the basic stuff right. I love it when they show a regional jet when they mean to show a long-haul widebody plane. Or when two different models are pictured at different times, intended to be the same plane. For example, a 737 is shown taking off. Minutes later we see footage of the same flight landing … except now it's a 747. It's just airplanes, nobody will notice, right? Except thousands of people do notice, and it's baffling the way Hollywood will go to such extreme efforts and cost to get certain period details correct — automobiles, consumer products, clothing, and haircuts — but it all goes out the window as soon as they get to the airport.
Movies we can forgive. The press, though, we hold to a higher standard.
Strange as it might sound, one of the better Hollywood takes was the old film "Airport '75." A 747 is struck near the flight deck in midair by a small propeller plane, and all three pilots are taken out (older 747s carried a third hand, the flight engineer). I almost hate to say it, but dangling Charlton Heston from a helicopter and dropping them through the hole in the fuselage wasn't as far-fetched a solution as it might sound. It was about the only way that jumbo jet was getting onto the ground in fewer than a billion pieces. The scene where Karen Black, playing a flight attendant, coaxes the crippled jumbo over a mountain range was, if not entirely accurate from a technical standpoint, very realistic in demonstrating the difficulty any civilian would have pulling off even a simple maneuver.
I've always thought the best and most evocative Hollywood moments are those in which airplanes appear incidentally — as background characters, so to speak, rather than central to the story. In my book I cite the example of the Polish Tupolevs idling on the apron in Krzysztof Kieślowski's "Dekalog IV." Best, though, is the old Convair jet that appears with Al Pacino in 1975's "Dog Day Afternoon." One of my all-time favorite movies, its final scene unfolds at Kennedy Airport, where bank robber Pacino is captured and handcuffed against a cop car, their accomplice shot through the head. In the background is a noisily idling jetliner, which Pacino thought would be their getaway plane. The plane is a Convair CV-990, a now-extinct four-engine jet that was an uncommon sight even in the mid-'70s. This peculiar rara avis is shown in the colors of Modern Air, a real-life charter carrier at the time. (What a great name that was: Modern Air.)
"Dog Day Afternoon" was one of few major motion pictures to feature no music whatsoever. There's no soundtrack, no backing score. Yet that closing scene is all about sound. Airplane sound. The earsplitting whine of the Convair's early-generation engines, and the roar of unseen planes taking off.
Beau Rutledge, a 2-year-old Georgia boy, was mauled and killed by the family's pit bull at home Wednesday afternoon, according to police.
Fulton County Police Detective Melissa Parker told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the attack occurred around 1 p.m. when the toddler's mother stepped away to use the restroom, leaving their son unattended with the dog. They returned to tragedy.
“She advised it happened fast,” Parker told the newspaper. “It was an obvious death once the mother came out of the restroom.”
ABC Atlanta affiliate WSB-TV reported that neighbors rushed outside when they heard the boy's mother screaming.
"(She) said, 'The dog attacked the baby. The dog killed the baby.' That's what I heard their say," neighbor Joseph Messam told the station.
First responders arrived at the family's townhouse but soon realized they were too late. Parker told NBC affiliate WXIA that responders were rattled by the gruesome scene inside the house, and that some "were in tears."
According the Journal-Constitution, the family had owned the dog, which animal control identified as a pit bull, for eight years. The dog remained enclosed in the house until 3 p.m., when animal control removed it and transported it to a shelter to "evaluate its health and temperament."
WXIA reports that it is yet unclear if the dog will be euthanized. The station noted that the dog had never shown aggression before.
The neighborhood where the incident occurred is home to many families with children. Neighbors indicated that the dog was well cared for, telling WSB that the boy's father could be seen walking the dog in the neighborhood every night.
According to WSB, the boy's distraught father "lost control" when police would not allow them in the house and had to be shocked with a Taser.
The ASPCA notes that although pit bulls have a "typical good nature with people," some owners have encouraged the dogs to behave aggressively.
"If a pit bull does bite, he's far more likely to inflict serious injuries than most other breeds, simply because of their size and strength," according to the ASPCA website.
Under the terms of the sequester, the Smithsonian will take a $40 million budget cut in 2013. Among the programs run by the Smithsonian? The National Zoo.
In today's Washington Post, Steve Hendrix talked to employees at the Smithsonian National Zoo about what the sequester would mean for the many animals they watch. They, unsurprisingly, are not pleased. “I have a very ill anteater right now,” said Craig Saffoe, curator of the zoo's big cats. “I have tigers that are breeding; I have tigers that are being shipped out; I have Andean bears with cubs fresh on the ground.”
But staff are also resolute. “We will never compromise on human safety, and we'll never compromise animal welfare,” promises Dennis Kelly, director of the National Zoo, which has a $50 million budget and employs 450 people. “These people are incredibly devoted to these animals.” The story is a great read, although it did miss one key question: How do the animals feel about this mess? Let's take a look!

CORRECTION: The animals in #7 were originally labeled "monkeys," but they are gibbons. And the critter in #18 is an Andean bear, not a sloth bear. We regret these errors.

Hundreds of thousands of women and men crowded the streets of Washington in an anti-Donald Trump rally and march on Saturday. Photographer Polina Yamshchikov (@polinavy) shared faces and voices from the street for @theintercept on Instagram. As they followed along the route of the Women's March on Washington, they asked the people that they met the same question: What are you marching for?
Ayesha Gill and Rabia Baig, from Virginia. “We are here to show support for everyone else who has been marginalized by Donald Trump. We've got their backs, and we're so grateful that they have ours.”
Dustin Philips, from Washington, D.C. “The collective energy—and positive feelings—here are such a contrast from yesterday. It has given me a little hope.”
Alina Mogilyanskaya and Elia Gran, from Barcelona. Alina says they are marching because they want “to resist the new regime,” while Elia says: “I am here for selfish reasons: for my own need to feel accompanied and feel this presence in this difficult time. I am from Barcelona and this march feels independent from any government. Women's rights are truly universal. I came because I could participate, regardless of citizenship.”
Rui Wang, of Tucson. “I came to send a message to the U.S. and to the world that decency, kindness, justice, constitutionality are important. It's a big tent and we may not all agree on every single issue, but it's so important to show solidarity with one other.”
Gayle Ayer, of Panama. “I care about my grandkids, but I'm not just here for my family—I am here for the whole world. They [Trump] wants to destroy so much. This matters a lot.”
Rosie Silvers, 16, (right) and Anna Goodman (left), of Maryland. Rosie says the girls are “here because we care about democracy, feminism, and human rights. We also came because we didn't have much of a voice in that we were too young to vote, so we want to make sure we are heard.”
Loretta Aiken, of Virginia.“I've lived around here for over 45 years and this is the biggest crowd that i've seen here since the Vietnam Protests. I was here for the original women's movement in '71-72. It makes me sad. Why have we not progressed further? We have in a lot of ways but we have so long to go.”
Connie Chen, of New York. “As a person of color who is also a woman, I know how vital it is to stand up for things you believe in. I am here today to stand with my fellow women, people of color, muslims, and oppressed people off all kinds.”
Chase Palmer, 16, and Julia Camara, 15, from D.C. “We are here because we refuse to tolerate who is in office.”
http://github.com/vmware/rvc
I'm pleased to announce the first public release of RVC, a Linux shell-like interface to ESX and VirtualCenter which presents the vSphere inventory as a virtual filesystem.
Many useful commands are already implemented, like VM power operations, connecting a VMRC or VNC session (to view your virtual machines' consoles), and vMotion. RVC is designed to make it easy for users to add commands of their own, so I'm counting on the community to contribute commands that I (as an ESX kernel developer at VMware) haven't needed yet.
RVC is written in Ruby, so you will need a Ruby interpreter and RubyGems installed, which you can find in your system's package manager. From there it should be a simple "gem install rvc". If you run into any installation problems please let me know. RVC might even work on OS X but I have not tested it there.
More documentation is available in the GitHub repository README. To get started, run "rvc user@host" and try the "help", "ls", "cd", and "info" commands.
This project is also being released as a VMware Labs Fling, so the same disclaimers apply.
Screencast showing how to run RVC on Windows by Eric Sloof: http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/archives/1738-Video-Latest-fling-from-VMware-Labs-Ruby-vSphere-Console.html. Windows support is a work in progress and has been improved since this screencast.
Packages needed:
FC14: ruby ruby-devel rubygems kernel-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel libxslt libxslt-devel libffi libffi-devel
Changelog:
2011-06-09: 1.4.0 released. Added OS X keychain support, permissions commands, shared sessions, and more.
2011-04-19: 1.3.0 released. Added aggregate marks, datastore.edit, and improved Windows compatibility.
2011-04-12: 1.2.0 released. Added wildcards, guest power ops, and ssh enhancements.
2011-04-05: 1.1.0 released. Added support for linked clones and host maintenance mode operations.

There's an incredible amount of nonsense in Romney's attack speech. [Transcript.]For example, a local Republican talk show host is repeating Romney's nonsense about tariffs causing a depression. As I recall, even Milton Friedman, who advocated free trade like a religion, didn't believe the Great Depression was caused by the tariff. See Protectionism Didn't Cause the Great Depression By Ian Fletcher, American Thinker, April 9, 2010.
On the contrary, it was tariffs—imposed through the wisdom of Alexander Hamilton—which allowed the US to progress from a poor colony dependent on foreign imports to the world's largest manufacturing economy—a fact that enabled American victory in WWII. And it is protectionism which has enabled the Asian tigers to eat our lunch in trade.
It has always struck me as ridiculous that we are told to fear retaliating against China because it would cause a trade war—it is like a man getting beaten to death keeping their hands in their pockets for fear of angering their assailant. What we are experiencing is already a trade war and we are losing badly. As Trump said, the current record trade deficits are unsustainable.
The massive deficits are not only paying for China's huge military build-up, but also allowing them to buy things like our largest pork producer, the Chicago Stock Exchange, and now a major movie theater chain. Ownership brings not only control, but profits going overseas along with technology. We are going to be a third world nation owned by absentee landlords.
Strangely, it was Romney in a 2011 campaign speech in Washington State who warned listeners that China was demanding technology transfer as a condition of buying Boeing airliners and China intended to use the technology given to them (and stolen) to compete with Boeing. But now Romney professes fear of Trump's willingness to fight back—Romney want us to continue to bend over.
Then there is this bit of Romney stupidity:
The second reason is because we're blessed with a great people — people who at every critical moment of choosing have put the interests of the country above their own."
Romney doesn't like Trump's immigration and "scapegoating" policy, but which of the immigrants pouring in meet Romney's criteria? Certainly not the Mexicans who wave Mexican flags, boast of the Reconquista, and throw trash at American sports teams—they clearly don't have American interests at heart. What about the Muslims—a large percentage of whom support Sharia.
And certainly not many of the Chinese and Indians I have met who bad-mouth the US in favor of their own countries and who have come only to make money. And if any of these immigrants vote, over 70% vote for socialist big government and not in favor of the freedom which has always been a big reason to want to be American.
Hypocritically, after calling Trump a "fraud", "fake", "phoney" and other insults, they have the nerve to say:
"Will they talk about our policy differences or will they attack me with every imaginable low road insult?"
Is Romney really this stupid—or do they just think we are? After an unprecedented attack on their own party's front runner with a slew of insults, they accuse Trump in advance of insulting them back.
Well, Romney is a liar and a traitor. After talking about "self deportation" in the primary, they betrayed the American people by promising "immigration reform''—always code words for amnesty—within a year of their election.
Phyllis Schlafly is right to say that we may not be able to return from another 4 or 8 years of being sold out by Establishment politicians of both parties. We may not know for sure what Trump will do if elected, but unfortunately we do know what the others will do. And people nervous about choosing Trump should take heart in the endorsement of a great American beyond reproach—Jeff Sessions.
If Trump doesn't make it, "Whence comes such another?" For to make a candidate like Trump, a person must not only have the patriotic beliefs—but also the fortune to ignore the big donors.

Alright, here's Fashion Quest Alpha 2... minor tweaks that make it play nice with Shoes 3. Download here (or on Github). Thanks again to ashbb of the Shoes team for their patches!
The framework relies on Shoes for cross-platform GUI and support and Ruby interpretation. Game elements may be defined using YAML and it is, to my knowledge, the first cross-platform IF framework using Ruby.
The manual can be viewed as PDF or HTML.
Quickstart:
Download the Fashion Quest archive and decompress it. Download the Shoes installer. Install Shoes. Run Shoes. Click "Open an App" and navigate to the Fashion Quest directory. Double-click run.rb. Select one of the demo games and click "OK".
Of the demo games, "Fashion Quest: Daydream" features location images and interaction with characters and "Pirate Adventure" is a port of a classic 1979 Scott Adams adventure. "Cloak of Darkness" is a short game that primarily serves as a benchmark with which to compare the framework to other IF frameworks.
Today I'd like to discuss a topic that is constantly recurring about LibreOffice: the overhaul of its interface. I am aware the matter has some real trolling potential, but at least if one wants to troll it is important to get some things straight first.
Is LibreOffice's interface outdated? It depends on who you ask the question. The problem is that some part of the answer is really a matter of taste; another part of it is really about the kind of interface we could have; and yet another side of the matter is the perception of what its interface should be like. Let's address the three issues separately.
A matter of taste
Do you like the Tango icons shipped by default with LibreOffice? Do you prefer the Sifr iconset? Really, it's up to you. Did you know you could customize pretty much each and every toolbar of the interface? You can not only add new toolbars, you can of course remove them, but you can also change their actual position and even customize them. You can use Firefox themes as the background of LibreOffice. What's not to like then? The interface is outdated? Now we're getting somewhere…
What kind of interface should we have?
That is actually a broad issue. The whole debate started at the times of the old OpenOffice.org project. Microsoft Office had just been shipped with its ribbon interface, and there were really two kinds of feedback. One was that we should switch right away to a ribbon-like interface. The other one was just as loud, and was urging us to stick to our menu based interface. Statistical analysis showed a clear correlation between a massive surge in downloads of OpenOffice.org and the ribbon interface of Microsoft Office. This debate has not changed since that day. We receive dozens of mail, tweets, comments telling us to get a ribbon interface, a dozen more urging us to the contrary. It is obvious that many people hate change, but it is also important to realize that with respect to the ribbon interface, there is no new and old interface. Ribbon intefaces are one of the three possible types of interfaces for a computer: text (command line, for instance), menu (LibreOffice, Photoshop, Firefox, etc.) and ribbon (Microsoft Office). The text interface obviously is the oldest, but the ribbon and menu interfaces are actually quite old. Tiled windows managers such as the old CDE or Fluxbox belong to the category of meny interfaces for instance. Ribbons were not overly popular before Microsoft Office and force a different way of thinking based on a stream of icons and options, rather than a highly logicial flow of menu and hierarchies. No one is “more or right or more wrong” than the other.
To me the real question is what we should have as actual improvements to our present inteface. It's not so much about how to make it look more up to date -major efforts have been accomplished since the 4.1- but how to make certain options more readily accessible to the user. A good example of people who went to think hard about the interface is the Calligra team. I'm not suggesting this is where LibreOffice should go, but it is clear they thought about a new way to think about the various menus and toolbars. Last but not least, it is also important to realize that LibreOffice on tablets or phones will have a new interface, or at least will go through a major simplification of the interface. Things are not idle in this field, but there are constraints. More on that below.
What should the user interface of LibreOffice look like?
Among the recent feedback on LibreOffice, someone on Google + wrote that we should copy the Microsoft Office's Ribbon interface “just like KingSoft Office”, because that way people would migrate seamlessly to LibreOffice. This kind of comment is not isolated, and I think it's important to set the record straight on this:
there are several copyright issues if you just copy Microsoft Office. Perhaps even patents. KingSoft is based in China. It is a different matter as they do not seem to be affected by these legal constraints.
we are not interested in being a clone. When you are a clone, people always prefer the original and you have invested tremendous resources in being just that, a clone. I don't think many LibreOffice developers are interested in a clone either. We are interested in developing the best office suite in Free Software, interested in growing our community, interested in helping others and promoting digital freedomes and bridge the digital divide. It is fine if you want to use a clone of Microsoft Office, but we're just not that kind of project.
That being said, would a ribbon interface for LibreOffice speed its deployment? It is very hard to say. Because people who hate ribbon interfaces would go away, while the rest of them would have to learn a new ribbon interface, a new way to do even the simplest things, while the rest of them would use alternatives or Google Drive, with its much simpler interface. On top of this, it is very important to always remember that we cannot change the LibreOffice user interface in one shot. The code is too complex, it has undetected dependencies pretty much everywhere, and we are thus constrained into incremental changes. Of course in a few years, the interface will look very different from what it does today. I could actually write the same about how LibreOffice looks like today: open it on Windows 7 or 8 and compare it with OpenOffice.org, any version of 2007-2008. You WILL notice major differences.
The conclusion of this (too long post) will thus be this one: when it comes to user interfaces, there are many truths and even more prophets; the reality however is more complex, and often times frustrating. If you want to help with the LibreOffice interface, join our Design team, and you will be able to work on improvements while incrementally changing it to something different and hopefully better. More importantly, you will have learned from a great community and this community will have learned from you!

Creating a single-payer health care system in California would cost $400 billion a year — including $200 billion in new tax revenue, according to an analysis of legislation released Monday by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The projected cost far surpasses the annual state budget of $180 billion, and skeptics of the bill say the price tag is “a nonstarter.”
Half of the $400 billion would come from existing federal, state and local spending on health care. An additional $200 billion would have to be raised by imposing a 15 percent payroll tax on California employers and employees, the analysis found. But the cost of the new tax would be partially offset by reduced spending on health care coverage by employers and employees — which is how nearly half of Californians receive health insurance.
“This is the gigantic brick wall that everyone who was paying attention was letting us know we were about to run into,” said Micah Weinberg, a policy researcher and president of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.
The assessment is the first price analysis released for SB562, introduced by state Sens. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens (Los Angeles County), and Toni Atkins, D-San Diego, which seeks to transform California's multipayer health system into a single-payer fee-for-service program that would cover all 39 million residents. The measure was approved by the Senate Health Committee in April and is now before the Appropriations Committee.
Many details about the bill have yet to be released, namely where the financing would come from. A spokesperson for Lara said that Monday's fiscal estimate is a “starting place” and that a plan to finance the bill would be released by September.
The analysis suggests the single-payer plan may not produce savings in the health system overall, said Larry Levitt, a health policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Current estimated spending on employer-sponsored health insurance is $100 billion to $150 billion a year — so an additional $50 to $100 billion would have to be generated to meet the $200 billion mark for new revenue, the analysis found.
“A single-payer plan would likely be more efficient, but it also offers better benefits and covers more people, and that costs money that has to come from somewhere,” Levitt said. “These numbers point to what is probably the most controversial part of a single-payer plan, which is the financing. You can be sure that opponents will emphasize the 15 percent tax, even though there are also big premium savings for employers and individuals.”
State legislators have attempted a number of times over the years to enact a single-payer system in California, including a 2007 measure sponsored by former state Sen. Sheila Kuehl that was vetoed by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. California voters have also rejected the single-payer concept, voting down a ballot initiative in 1994 that would have created a health care system administered and financed by the state.

Is Candida Related to Multiple Chemical Sensitivities?
So many people today have an allergic reaction to chemical's which they are exposed to. Some people react violently to bleach, detergents, perfumes, shampoos or any of the other 2000 chemicals which can easily be found in the products purchased for hygiene purposes. Chemical sensitivities can be caused by several factors, one of which could be fungal infections. The body will sometimes allow Candida in, to use as a storage unit for chemicals or heavy metals or any number of harmful synthetics which could harm the body if not contained. Most people will begin to notice sensitivity to a chemical when their body no longer has storage space, the liver can no longer handle the overload, the immune system can't keep up with the burden it has to process. What can be done? By killing the Candida, detoxifying the liver and boosting the immune system, the body has the help it's needed for years!!!
Candida can produce some terrible die off effects which are sometimes worse than the infection itself, however by using our new anti-Candida program the die off occurs so quickly, it doesn't have a chance to produce the die off symptoms. When alive, Candida releases chemicals which go to the brain to cause us to crave the sugars it needs to feed on, using the body parasitically. These chemicals slow our Liver and Kidney function.
When it dies it also releases chemicals which need to be neutralized quickly to prevent side effects.
The symptoms of Candida infections include:
abdominal gas
headaches
migraines
excessive fatigue
cravings for alcohol
anxiety
vaginitis
rectal itching
cravings for sweets
inability to think clearly or concentrate
hyperactivity
mood swing
diarrhea
constipation
skin itching
acne
eczema
depression
sinus inflammation
premenstrual syndrome
dizziness
poor memory
persistent cough
earaches
low sex drive
muscle weakness
irritability
learning difficulties
sensitivity to fragrances and/or other chemicals
cognitive impairment
thrush
athletes foot
sore throat
indigestion
acid reflux and hot flashes.
Once the fungal infection is gone, the immune system is boosted; the body no longer overreacts to the chemicals which we are constantly exposed to. The liver can process them and excrete them before they cause the body harm, it no longer needs to store them! Our anti-Candida programs are very well rounded programs which consist of Live Blood Analysis to monitor your progress, IV Therapy, Oxygen/Ozone therapy to boost the immune, nutritional supplementation to support your body. Every anti-Candida program is overseen by our medical director Ms. Wendee Burnett NP. The programs must be done according to their orders, usually requiring 3 (depending on the severity of infection) weeks of intense therapy.
It is difficult to describe the effects of this therapy along with all the benefits because they differ so much. Some of the effects are a systemic alkalization, immune system boosting and systemic detoxification, basically everything that alternative healthcare specialists have been telling us to do for years. Patients are feeling great sometimes after just 2-3 treatments! Within days positive changes can be seen by the recipient of the therapy.
The Akershus Castle in Oslo has played a very important role in the history of Norway's capital Oslo by becoming one of the most significant defensive fortresses in Norway and warding off numerous hostile invasions. The strategical bay location of the fortress made Akershus Castle a major military and trade point.
The Akershus Castle in Oslo is almost always on the sightseeing itinerary included in many Norway travel packages.
Let's take a look at 7 interesting facts about Akershus Castle in Oslo that helped shape its history throughout the centuries:
1. The Akershus Castle was initially built sometime in the 13th century under the orders of King Hakon of Norway as a defense fortress to protect the capital of Norway from multiple Swedish invasions. It was later fully renovated in the style or a standard Renaissance Castle at the beginning of the 17th century.
2. The Akershus Castle lived through its first battle in 1308 when it was surrounded by the army of Swedish duke Erik who later became a King of Sweden.
3. The Akershus Castle also served as prison facility that hosted many legendary criminals of Norwegian history particularly Gjest Baardsen and Ole Høiland. The fortress also became a dungeon for political prisoners of the early socialist movement in Norway.
4. All male participants of the famous Kautokeino rebellion that took place in 1852 were imprisoned in the cells of the Akershus Castle and later died there with the exception of Lars Haeta who became famous for their first translation of the Bible into the Sami language.
5. No foreign enemy was able to capture the Akershus Castle throughout the centuries of its military history. This record was broken in 1940 when the fortress was surrendered without combat to Nazi forces and remained under German occupation up to 1945.
6. Akershus Castle became an execution place for 8 Norwegian traitors found guilty for war crimes at the end of WWII. This act is considered rather symbolic since so many Nazi opposition members were being killed at the fortress throughout WWII. Currently there's a very extensive museum displaying memorabilia and objects pertaining to the large Nazi opposition movement in Norway during WWII.
7. Up to this day Akershus Castle possesses significant military importance by being Norwegian Ministry of Defense and Defense Staff Norway headquarters. The popular Norwegian Armed Forces museum is also located on the grounds of the fortress.

This was a "secret ballot", with the authors invited to fill in a form with their predictions, so they were not influenced by anyone else's opinion [though let's face it, anyone likely to be influenced by anything is not the kind of person we want as a SnakePit writer...] These were then collated, and the results are below. As well as a win total, people were also asked whether we'd make the post-season, and their reasoning, be it long or short. Also, so you can get an idea of previous form and whether they tend to pessimism (a negative number indicating they were below our actual wins) or optimism, is how far away they were from the actual mark in our 2015 predictions.

Because as good as we may seem to be at this point, injuries happen and there's a certain cachet to having been there and done that. Plus, it's not as if the Cardinals, Pirates, Cubs, Giants, Nationals, Mets or Dodgers are just gonna roll over.

Cause f*** it, I'm all in. There are a lot of things that can go right for this team is things coalesce in a good way (there's also a lot that can go wrong, but let's ignore that). The team's rotation is stacked, the offense has a chance to be really good, especially if someone in the middle infield figures out how to baseball, the Dodgers' rotation is Clayton Kershaw and a bunch of hobos, and the Giants' even-year bulls*** has to end sometime. This has the potential to be one of the more exciting seasons in Diamondbacks history.
It could also be underwhelming and terrible, so the Diamondbacks need to decide if this season is "The Phantom Menace" or "The Force Awakens" in terms of anticipation/results.
freeland1787 - 86 wins
Post-season? No.
2015: N/A
My baseline for the 2016 season is 86 wins, but with some better luck in one-run games, it's quite possible they get to 94 wins and take the division and have home-field for the NLDS. The Dbacks have one of the best lineups in baseball and finally have a rotation they can win games with. Cautious optimism is the theme for the early part of the season.
Xipooo- 96 wins

I expect the offense to be just as good as last year with a bit more power despite lower numbers for Pollock. The pitching will do wonders for the team and I see a lot of games being put away early.
preston.salisbury - 85 wins
Post-season? No
2015: N/A
The Diamondbacks enter 2016 with a vastly improved rotation, but with an offense and defense that will almost certainly be worse than in 2015. While performance during Spring Training has increased optimism, they will still need almost perfect health or surprise breakout performances from depth players in order to make the postseason. That could happen, but I think somewhere in the neighborhood of 85 wins is most likely.
I Suppose I'm A Pessimist - 88 wins
Post-season? Yes, as a wild-card
2015: 0. Nailed it!
We have the best offense and defense in the NL, along with better pitching. I can see us playing .500 baseball for awhile, but I expect a big push late in the season.
Nate Rowan - 87 wins
Post-season? No
2015: N/A
The additions of Zack Greinke, Shelby Miller, and a full year of Corbin are able to get the Diamondbacks right on the cusp of the playoffs. Goldy, Pollock, Peralta will all be all-star caliber players. However, they can't quite produce enough offense to make up for the loss of Inciarte and the offensive woes of the middle infield. In a year where the NL Central and West look to be strong again, 87 wins just won't be enough for a play-off berth.
James Attwood - 87 wins
Post-season? No
2015: N/A
With the improvements made to the pitching staff as a while, I like the team's chances to stay in games longer than last season. I also think they now have a chance to throw a number of shut-down games themselves. The offense is looking good this spring, but I am still very skeptical that the team is not due for some negative regression from some key performers in 2015. Paul Goldschmidt will probably have another MVP-caliber season. A.J. Pollock may have another strong year in him. I expect both to slide at least some though, if not much. Others, like Castillo and Peralta worry me a bit more. Their games are less rounded out. They may still be strong positive contributors, but I am not buying that they beat last season's numbers by any noticeable margin.
On the flip-side I expect improved performances from Jake Lamb and the middle infield. I think these improvements could offset a good majority of the losses from the stronger performers.
Left field will be a big part of the success or failure for this team. The team need Tomas+Brito to offset the loss of Ender Inciarte. I'm still a bit worried that they will be hard-pressed to match the 2015 level of production that Inciarte provided. I need to see more of a healthy Tomas in MLB action.
Overall, I think the positives outweigh the negatives and that the team improves on last year's push that had them finishing just short of a .500 record. At the same time, I think this team got cold feet after signing Greinke, and fell short of doing enough to pick up those marginal wins necessary to win a divisional title.
Makakilo - 89-92 wins (damn bet hedger!)
Post-season? Yes, as division winners
2015: N/A
Compared to 2015, pitching improves dramatically. Top three starters are a powerhouse – Greinke, Miller, and Corbin.
Compared to 2015, weaknesses at second and third become strengths. Lamb, Ahmed, Segura, Owings, Gosselin, and Drury provide both strength and depth at second, third, and shortstop.
The outstanding core players are young and are back this year.
The door is wide-open for the Diamondbacks to win the Division. I project the Giants at 87.5 wins, which is marginally better than last year. I project the Dodgers at 85 wins, mostly caused by degraded starting pitching and weak relief pitching.
My optimistic prediction is 92 wins, which does not include an injury or performance slump. A more detailed explanation of my optimistic prediction can be read at: http://www.azsnakepit.com/2016/3/26/11270852/2016-arizona-diamondbacks-preview-optimism-why-we-will-win-the-nl-west
A more realistic prediction would include an injury and a performance slump. For some positions, the Diamondbacks have a quality player ready to step in. The Diamondbacks will be in contention, raising the possibility that funds could be found for an addition to fill-in for an injured player. Therefore, my realistic projection is 89 wins. Will that be enough to win the NL West? Yes!
Jim McLennan - 88 wins
Post-season? Yes, as a wild-card
2015: -5
This is one of those questions where my heart is pulling strongly in one direction, but my head is yelling something about restraint. We've been optimistic before, and been disappointed - but the sense of excitement and anticipation for 2016 seems above any beyond anything in recent memory. Will that mean the subsequent disappointment is worse?
As mentioned in the preview conclusions, I think we will need a couple of things to break the team's way to push to the next level. These aren't impossible: any two of Tomas blossoming, Segura rebounding or Miller developing would probably push Arizona right into the heart of the division race. But there is equal scope for downside: injuries, especially to key players like Pollock, Goldschmidt or Greinke, could have a very significant negative impact. The error bars on my prediction this year is certainly bigger than for quite some time, and nothing from 75-95 wins would seem outside the bounds of possibility.
That said, I think our rotation is enormously improved all round, going from the biggest weakness to one of the best in the league. If that's not worth half a dozen extra wins, I'll be surprised, and even if losing Inciarte will hurt, the slack can be taken up elsewhere on the diamond. If the team stays healthy, they'll be there or thereabouts, and the prospect of meaningful baseball in September is quite exciting, isn't it? If not... Well, this team will become the poster child for why spring W-L records are meaningless!

The Dbacks will crush their enemies, see them driven before them and hear the lamentations of the women. As was foretold in the Scrolls of Skelos.
Steven Burt - 73 wins
Post-season: No

Despite the success of the team in Spring Training, things will go wrong in just about every way for the D-backs in 2016. Injuries to key players, off-season acquisitions will disappoint and players who have no business starting will continue to be given chances to underperform. In the end, you have a disaster of a season that will leave more questions than answers and a front office that will continue to follow the beat of its own drum.

I personally think the Wild Card is going to be a tough path for any team this year, what with the Cubs, Cards, and Pirates probably all fighting for it. We can't count on beating all three of them plus others As for the division, I see it coming down to us and the Giants. The Dodgers are already fighting injuries, and after Kershaw, there just isn't a whole lot in their rotation. Ultimately, It's going to come down to is the off season acquisitions of Grienke+Miller better than Cueto+Alphabet Soup. My money is on the D'backs there.
Conclusions
With guesses from 73 all the way up to 96, I think we've probably got the range covered. However, only one person had the D-backs winning below 86 games, with the others clustered in the high eighties or low to mid nineties.Two-thirds of respondents think the team will make the post-season, though this obviously reflects a certain degree of fan optimism. It's certainly a far distance from this time last year, when only person thought we would even reach .500. Our average estimate there proved five games too low, and hopefully that will be the case again this year. If it is, I think we'll be in good shape, because adding them up (and giving Makakilo the middle of their range!) we get:
Overall average: 88.5 wins.
TORONTO — The road to Rio hit a bump for the Canadian women's soccer team Saturday, soundly beaten 2-0 by Brazil in an international friendly.
It was Canada's first game on home soil since last summer's World Cup. And as homecomings go, it was decidedly shaky — admittedly against quality opposition — despite an enthusiastic crowd of 28,604 on a sunny afternoon at BMO Field.
"Really disappointing because I know there's more to come from that group," said Canadian coach John Herdman.
They will be hoping it comes Tuesday in Ottawa where the 10th-ranked Canadians face the No. 8 Brazilians in a rematch.
Canada had a woeful start punctuated by poor touches and giveaways. The home side trailed 2-0 at the half on goals by Marta and looked uncertain on defence and clumsy on offence. The poised Brazilians, meanwhile, defended well and showed flair and skill in cutting open the Canadians, who saw their four-game winning streak snapped.
A frank Herdman acknowledged their players looked nervous at the start. They also suggested that the game plan "to take control of the game" early on rather than play direct football up the middle had been too much on the day.
"I think they'll learn from it, for sure," they said, adding they believe their players have the talent to play "a better brand of football."
They pointed to youngsters Nichelle Prince, Deanne Rose, Ashley Lawrence and Jessie Fleming as positive storylines.
But they were blunt when asked about goalkeeper Stephanie Labbe, who has taken over as No. 1 from the injured Erin McLeod. The 29-year-old Labbe, who earned their 29th cap, had some shaky moments early on but improved as the game wore on.
Herdman said while they wanted to keep the faith, they may have to assess their goalkeeping options.
"As a coach, you've got to make a big decision here. Do you keep pushing or do you keep the fight open and see who will respond well?"
With McLeod out well past the Olympics and Sabrina D'Angelo nursing a fractured wrist, the other option is 20-year-old Kailen Sheridan, who has one cap.
Canada came on in the second half, with the Brazilians making it interesting late with some loose passages of play. The crowd willed the Canadian women on as the clock wound down, cheering every attack whether it was warranted or not.
In the buildup to the match, Canadian captain Christine Sinclair called Marta "still the one player in the women's game that can almost single-handedly win a game for their country." The 30-year-old forward lived up to that billing, taking advantage of Canadian errors.
A defensive meltdown led to a Brazil goal in the 11th minute.
Centre back Kadeisha Buchanan went down in the sideline trying to break up a play, allowing Beatriz to race down the flank. Allysha Chapman misplayed the ball, which bounced to Marta who took full advantage from close range.
Marta made it 2-0 with a long-range shot in the 41st after Janine Beckie was dispossessed in midfield. Buchanan gave Marta too much room and the Brazilian star used it to hammer a left-footed shot past Labbe from outside the penalty box.
"Kadeisha will want that one back, for sure," said Herdman.
Sinclair, who has been nursing a leg injury in recent months, gave way to Melissa Tancredi in the 74th minute. Marta exited two minutes later.
Sinclair gave credit to Brazil.
"They're one of the best teams in the world. They came out pressing us, they caused two mistakes by us and they punished us for it ... But I thought we rallied. The second half was a lot better. The second half was a lot more of what we expect. We just didn't put the ball in the back of the net."
Canada's starting 11 came into the game with 863 caps between them. Sinclair, Desiree Scott, Sophie Schmidt and Diana Matheson accounted for 677 of those.
Bronze medallists four years ago in London, Canada wraps up its pre-Olympic schedule with a game July 23 against No. 3 France in Auxerre. The Canadians will play a closed-door game against No. 12 China while in France.
Canada's all-time record against Brazil drops to 5-7-6. The Canadians had won their last meeting, 2-1 in the Algarve Cup final in March in Portugal, ending a four-game winless streak (0-3-1) against the South Americans.
The Canadian women have played 15 games since exiting the World Cup at the quarter-final stage, compiling a 10-5-0 record.

PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins considers Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald a good friend. They've known one another since Jenkins entered the league in 2009, and train together in the offseason.
When they go toe-to-toe, like they will Sunday when the Eagles host the Cardinals (1 p.m.), Fitzgerald keeps things friendly while trying to rip their old pal's heart out.
"He's a nice guy on the field. They try to distract you with kindness," said Jenkins, "so I try to ignore him.”

Jenkins and the rest of the Eagles' defense has seen enough to know that bad intentions lie beneath that professional demeanor. Fitzgerald has lit up plenty of teams over the course of their distinguished 14-year career, but has always had a little something extra for Philly. In seven games against the Eagles, he's averaged six catches, 99 yards and more than a touchdown. Their 673 yards and eight TDs are the most against a non-division opponent.
“He's gone from being a number one receiver on the outside to now being a top slot receiver in the league," said Jenkins. "I don't think anybody questions that he's going to be a Hall-of-Famer, and they have to know that, but is still doing the small things, the humble things like blocking not only DBs but linebackers and D-ends; they do that willingly and they do that well. He's one of those guys that shows up. He's the same guy every time.”
But he's not the only guy. The Cardinals also have some dangerous speed receivers in J.J. Nelson, John Brown and Jaron Brown. (Nelson and John Brown have both been limited this week.) That could spell trouble for an Eagles secondary that has been susceptible to the big play over the last two weeks in particular.
A key matchup lies in the trenches. Quarterback Carson Palmer has been sacked a league-high 17 times this season and has been hit 29 times, tied for seventh-most in the league. The Eagles' front four, which could be without standout DT Fletcher Cox (calf) for a second straight week, will have to keep the heat on Palmer to keep the deep ball off a thin cornerback group.
“They like taking shots downfield. That's just how they always have been,” said Jenkins. “I don't see this being one of those games like the Giants where the ball is out quick. I'm really seeing this being one where we have to protect the deep end of the field.”
As for Fitzgerald, Jenkins smiled when asked what they plan to do against him, allowing that it's "one of those matchups I look forward to." Corner Patrick Robinson has been manning the slot pretty well for the Eagles through the first four games and is also likely to get a good deal of snaps against him.
At 34 years old, Fitzgerald leads the team in targets (41) receptions (26) and yards (276). The Eagles know they have their hands full both with Fitzgerald, the rest of the receiving corps and Andre Ellington coming out of the backfield.
"Yeah, another Hall-of-Fame quality player," defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz. "It is not just about Larry Fitzgerald, though. They can put a 4 by 100 team together, and they have got a lot of speed and a quarterback that has -- I know [Cardinals] Coach [Bruce] Arians has said he's playing at a level that they have not seen them play before. They have had their struggles here and there. But I think he's really playing good football, and we have our work cut out for us. Again, it can't just be about Larry Fitzgerald and it can't be about one player. If you make it that way you're going to be susceptible to other things, and we've got to do a better job of not being susceptible to other things."

AKRON, Ohio-- The heroin problem is an epidemic. But, a far more dangerous version of the drug is claiming more lives, taxing public safety systems and requiring more of the antidote than ever to keep users alive.
In Akron, July has been a tragic month with a record number of overdoses and deaths now linked to an animal tranquilizer that's being laced with heroin and is 10,000 times stronger than morphine. Akron police report 247 overdoses, and 21 deaths in the past 20 days. It's tying up safety services.
The Barberton Fire Department and EMS say, in the past month, half of all of their calls-- as many as all of the other calls combined-- is because of an overdose.
The department is ordering more of the antidote Narcan than it ever has because it takes as much as seven doses now to try and revive someone who has taken the heroin that's been laced with the very powerful tranquilizer carfentanil.
"A dose of Narcan would usually revive that person and bring them back. What we are noticing now is our paramedics sometimes use between four and six, maybe seven doses of the Narcan to revive them, so it is a lot stronger and it has taken a lot more," said Lt. Rick Edwards with Akron police.
The amount of Narcan being delivered is growing; the cost is growing.

The Marvel universe is about to change in a drastic way. Joss Whedon has had a big impact on Marvel in the past few years, molding comic book legends into live-action superheroes that have thrilled millions of fans. Sadly, that is to be no more. Whedon's departure has left many wondering why he's so willing to abandon their relationship with Marvel Studios when it would seem to have been as beneficial to them as it was for Marvel. Joss has taken the time to provide a thorough answer during a Q&A with the Oxford Union.
Joss Whedon Was Seduced By The Dark Side Of Marvel
Joss says that their relationship with the studio was difficult to manage because they often felt used and put in an unsavory position. While they might have taken objection long ago, the Avengers: Age of Ultron director says they were seduced by the thrill of making the comic book adaptations. They add that had Marvel given more consideration to their opinions, they might not have resigned, even though the workload of managing so many franchises was, in itself, overwhelming.
“I was a script doctor for a long time, and the part where they listen to you was very rare; so it was very important for my own self to go ‘we can still be friends,' but…”
Joss admits that bringing these specific characters to life and being able to put their own unique spin on their stories has been something that really motivated them to stay with Marvel. Having free reign and a valued opinion is important to everyone, so it's easy to see why Mr. Whedon has been frustrated with the studio in the recent past. Many of their fans would add that Joss Whedon hardly needs Marvel, or any one studio, to create compelling films or television.
In the beginning, Joss says Marvel handed them hundreds of millions of dollars to indulge their talents and bring their films to life. They understand how truly fortunate he's been, but they say that kind of success can also be incredibly limiting.
“At the same time, it's important for me not just to have my own thing and do something smaller, but also to create a new challenge for myself because I will start to repeat myself.”
Joss Whedon Had Proven Their Creative Genius Long Before Marvel Came Along
Whedon is more than a success. To many, he's a living legend, and that kind of hero worship reaches far beyond the Marvel universe, stemming from their ingenious contributions to television and film. They started out writing episodes for the sitcoms Roseanna (1988) and Parenthood (1990) before moving on to pen their first feature films, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992) and Toy Story (1995).
Mr. Whedon is perhaps best known for the short-lived Firefly (2002) and the long-running 1997 television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Additionally, Joss created a successful spinoff, Angel (1999), which fans of the Buffy universe equally adore. The Buffy the Vampire Slayer universe has become a beast of its own, inspiring comic book series for both Buffy and Angel, as well as fan fiction and fan video edits, which have essentially created unique new stories in themselves.
It wasn't until those successful franchises ended their television runs that Marvel drew Joss in with the promise of riches and free-reign creativity, a promise that proved partly false and entirely too controlling. Now, free of their obligations to Marvel, it will be interesting to see what new projects Mr. Whedon tackles next. Could there be a Buffy or Firefly reboot or return in the future? Or something entirely new, but just as addicting?

For voters in the Northwest Territories, the federal election on Oct. 19 merely marked the end of one campaign and the start of another.
Today, voters in 18 of the territory's 19 constituencies will choose from 59 candidates for the next Legislative Assembly. One candidate, Jackson Lafferty in the central N.W.T. riding of Monfwi, had no opponents, and is acclaimed.
And even with today's territorial election, the politicking does not end. While voters will know who their new MLAs will be later tonight, they won't know who will actually form the government for a couple more weeks.
That's because, under the territory's non-partisan consensus system of government, newly-elected MLAs will choose the premier, cabinet and speaker from among themselves, typically around two weeks after the general election.
With no parties and no opinion polls, the results in many ridings will be impossible to predict. But here are five things to think about on election day.
1. Incumbency has its privileges
Like everywhere else, incumbents generally enjoy an advantage over their challengers. Unlike in party systems, where voters will often cast ballots based on the desire for a new government as much as an MLA's performance, incumbents are often judged on their own records in the assembly. This usually offers an extra advantage for cabinet ministers, though not always: former Nunavut premier Eva Aariak lost their own seat in that territory's election in 2013. But with 16 of 19 incumbents running again, there could be an awful lot of familiar faces in the next assembly.
2. Bread and butter
Pocketbook issues dominated candidates' agendas in most N.W.T. ridings, particularly in Yellowknife. The twin issues of the cost of living and the territory's gloomy economic outlook are on the minds of many voters, and it will be interesting to see which candidates benefit from that. Will voters opt for candidates talking up issues like the cost of electricity, or those pushing for more resource development?
3. Speaking of resources
Premier Bob McLeod's government built its economic vision for the territory on resource development. McLeod and their cabinet hustled hard, particularly on the oil and gas front, conducting trade missions to Asia and talking up the territory's resource potential with the U.S. energy industry. But prices for oil, natural gas and minerals are low and the territory's high operating costs have led to a major downturn in exploration. The last government's plan was to boost spending on power generation and other infrastructure to coax industry back to life. Will voters endorse this approach?
4. Toss-up ridings
The ridings with no incumbent running — Frame Lake, Sahtu and Yellowknife North — are all highly competitive races with no clear favourite. Yellowknife North has five candidates, while Frame Lake and Sahtu each have four. All three could see close finishes on election night.
In Nahendeh, no fewer than six candidates came forward to challenge incumbent Kevin Menicoche, meaning it's theoretically possible someone could win the seat by garnering as little as 15 per cent of the vote.
Nunakput has four challengers taking on the incumbent, and Deh Cho has four candidates, including the current MLA.
5. Who wants to be a cabinet minister?
While the exact make-up of cabinet is often determined by an opaque process of back room deal-making, convention holds that two ministers hail from each of three regions: the north, the south and Yellowknife. The premier is usually selected independently of that. There are proposals to pick all seven executive council members at once and ensure an additional slot goes to Yellowknife or to a woman, but that will be up to the next assembly.
The other question, of course, is who becomes premier. So far, no N.W.T. premier has served more than one term, but there have been rumours that Bob McLeod intends to seek a second term (which they have denied). Of course, for that to happen, they have to get re-elected as an MLA, then convince their colleagues to break with longstanding tradition.
A US federal agency that sought to pay photographers for “positive images” of its work in Afghanistan has canceled the program. The project, created to combat negative news coverage, collapsed amid charges that the effort amounted to propaganda.
Using US$1 billion on aid programs in Afghanistan, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) solicited proposals on Monday for a project that aimed to "help inform Afghans about the assistance American taxpayers are providing," an anonymous USAID official told USA Today of Thursday's decision.
"The wording of the (request) did not appropriately articulate that purpose and is being re-evaluated,” the official said.
In addition to targeting Afghans, the program was intended to gather support in the United States for USAID initiatives in Afghanistan. Over 12 years old, the war in Afghanistan is highly unpopular with the American public, if the war can be called an issue of popular awareness at all. A CNN poll released at the New Year found record low 17 percent support for the ongoing efforts in Afghanistan.
The proposal was quickly criticized by a public advocacy group as a blatant hype campaign.
"USAID should instead be focusing on accomplishing mission goals, not glossy propaganda," said Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a non-partisan government watchdog organization. "Waste, fraud, and poor performance have already resulted in billions being lost, let's not throw additional money down the drain."
The agency called the budding program one that would serve to show positive influences of US aid in the war-torn country amid the “negative” images usually shown by news organizations.
"USAID is executing the most massive US international assistance campaign ever, and the gains particularly in health and education have been impressive, yet the overwhelming majority of pictures recording that effort are negative, and at least to some extent misleading," the solicitation reads. "This is because professional photographers working for news agencies are the prime source of high-quality images of USAID work in Afghanistan. News photographs by their very nature focus on the negative."
Top objectives of the project included countering negative representations of Afghanistan, distributing those images through USAID social media, and to establish a long-term contract that would continually provide such images “to conventional media and directly to the US public.”
USAID also sought to influence American thought on efforts in Afghanistan.
"The US and Afghan publics require accurate, well-balanced information about USAID work abroad," the proposal states. "Currently, this requirement is not being met in Afghanistan."
USAID did not disclose how much contract photographers would earn for the photos.
The announcement of the “positive image” proposal on Monday came alongside the unveiling of three new USAID development programs worth almost $300 million to wean Afghanistan off its 'war economy,' which is heavily subsidized today by opium exports – a trade that had been practically squashed while the country was under Taliban rule.
Under the USAID initiative, $125 million will go to reviving Afghanistan's food and farm sector, and another $77 million to opening up the country to greater international trade and investment. The last program, valued at about $100 million, would seek to assist Afghanistan's educational system.
A report released late last month by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) found that Afghanistan cannot be trusted to properly spend the millions of dollars it receives in aid from the United States. The report found that none of Afghanistan's 16 ministries could be entrusted with USAID funds without high risk of that assistance being stolen or wasted.
In September, the SIGAR chastised USAID for poor oversight of money the agency spent there. A SIGAR report highlighted how USAID gave over $230 million to the Afghan Ministry of Health with little guidance for how the money was to be spent.
"Despite financial management deficiencies at the Afghan Ministry of Public Health, USAID continues to provide millions of US taxpayer dollars in direct assistance with little assurance that the (ministry) is using these funds as intended," according to the SIGAR report.
Meanwhile, after a long, protracted struggle that sought to convince Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai to approve a security deal, the US is considering leaving the issue suspended until the Afghan presidential elections in April in order to address Karzai's successor.
The Obama administration has long hoped to get the long-lasting bilateral security deal with Kabul signed by the end of 2013, yet Karzai has refused to take responsibility for leaving a several thousand-strong US military contingent in the country beyond 2014.
December 25, 2015 Warmest Christmas Eve on record to unfold across eastern US
By By Kristina Pydynowski December 25, 2015, 5:19:33 AM EST
Any hopes of a white Christmas that the weekend chill brought will be dashed in the eastern United States, with this Christmas Eve shaping up to be the warmest on record in many communities.
According to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Tom Kines, "On Christmas Eve, parts of the mid-Atlantic and New England could be just as warm as they were on the Fourth of July."
Record high temperatures, including some record warm minimum temperatures, are likely to be set from Florida to Maine.
New York City already racked their Christmas Eve record at 1:00 a.m., surpassing the old record of 63 degrees at a balmy 67. Temperatures for the afternoon will reach the middle 70s.
Balmy Christmas Eve
According to AccuWeather Chief Long Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok, "On Christmas Eve, daily record highs may be broken in the morning, followed by monthly record highs in the afternoon."
Records in the major cities of the Eastern states date back to the middle 1800s.
Another northward bulge in the jet stream will be responsible for the warmth in the East this week.
The jet stream is a strong river of air high in the atmosphere that guides weather systems and separates warm air to the south from cold air to the north.
Christmas Eve will feel more like Easter with highs ranging from the 50s in Maine to the 70s in the mid-Atlantic and the lower 80s in parts of the Southeast. That equates to highs that are 15 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit above normal.
"Temperatures could touch 80 as far north as the mid-Atlantic states," Pastelok said.
Widespread record highs will not only be challenged but also shattered in many towns and cities. The potential exists for records to be topped by more than 10 degrees from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia to New York City and to Burlington, Vermont.
“It appears high temperatures will be in the 70s on Christmas Eve in New York City, which is about 35 degrees above normal for the date,” AccuWeather Meteorologist Bill Deger said. “It was also unusually warm last Christmas Eve in 2014, when Central Park reached 58 F for a high.”
Subtropical air will be drawn northward along with the warmth and will make it feel humid to some people.
Along with erasing any hopes for a white Christmas, the warmth will mean residents can leave the heavy winter jackets, hats or mittens at home when heading out for last-minute shopping or to Christmas Eve services.

The only chance of a white Christmas will be in the Tug Hill region of New York state, east of Lake Ontario, and northern Maine, where old snow may remain on the ground.
The warmth will come despite some clouds and a couple of showers in the area. Those wanting to take advantage of the warmth by caroling, taking a walk, firing up the grill or engaging in any other outdoor activity should plan to keep an umbrella handy.
The passage of a cold front will ease the extreme warmth in the Northeast for Christmas Day, but temperatures will still be well above normal for the holiday. In the Southeast, Friday will likely be a repeat of Thursday.
Since temperatures will be so high during the overnight hours on Thursday, record highs for Christmas day may be set before dawn in a number of locations.
According to AccuWeather Meteorologist Ed Vallee, the return of persistent cold will not be the theme for the remainder of 2015.
“The extreme warmth of late will certainly be muted after Christmas Day, but above-average temperatures continuing through the end of the month will set the stage for December monthly temperature records to be broken in some areas of the East,” they said.

I've been writing about Mega Man over on Anatomy of a Game, and while it's all well and good for me to say, “Hey, this was a pretty great game,” that all gets a little fuzzy in the blur of history, you know? Mega Man arrived in Japan in December 1987 under the title Rockman, a venture by the generally underwhelming home console division of Capcom, and it marked a massive departure for the company. Not only was it hands-down superior to everything Capcom had developed and published on consoles to that date, it put the company's internal studio on equal footing with the best developers on Famicom. For comparison, I've picked out the most comparable games released within three months of Rockman on either side. In this context, I really think the game stands out – only a couple of games come close to its level of control precision, the speed of its action, the depth of its mechanics, and its graphical finesse.
Before Rockman
Air Fortress (HAL): A simple shooter that doesn't play as well as it intends to, Air Fortress has its moments – its structure isn't entirely different from Wario Land 4 – but never quite reaches classic status.
Castlevania II (Konami): Recurring theme here: The only titles that really stand on par with Mega Man come from Konami, who for my money were the single best third-party developer for NES. I'd even argue that they were better than Nintendo in some respects. Less revolutionary, but more consistent. How many truly great NES games did Nintendo develop? Konami didn't hit as hard, but it hit more steadily, and there's a lot to be said for that kind of constancy. Simon's Quest has its problems, but it looks and sounds great, and its design demonstrates a lot of ambition.
Faxanadu (Hudson): A legitimate action RPG, Faxanadu has high-minded goals but its repetitive graphics and imperfect design keep it from achieving all it aspires to. Big world, moderate exploration, RPG leveling almost but not quite offset weird collision detection, easily exploited design, and a pervasive sense of mediocrity.
Rambo (Pack-in Video): I like this game, but I also recognize that it's kind of terrible. Exploration and wilderness survival thwarted by some really stupid design decisions and incredibly vague objectives and stage layouts.
Star Wars (Namco): The weirdest Star Wars game of them all, this platformer isn't as terrible as it looks. But it plays awkwardly and isn't particularly fun, either.
After Rockman
Karnov (Data East): This game feels like a relic of 1986, not an early 1988 release. Janky, confusing, and poorly controlling, it's a mess.
Konami Wai Wai World (Konami): A surprisingly clumsy effort from Konami, the multi-character swapping and sloppy mechanics make it feel like a spiritual predecessor to the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in a lot of ways.
Contra (Konami): A legitimate masterpiece, this shooter took a solid arcade game and made it amazing. Top-notch level design, a brilliant set of weapons, great graphics and music – Contra totally spanked Mega Man.
Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode (Vic Tokai): Kind of disaster of a game, it combines a lot of modes (side-scrolling action, sniping, horizontal shooter, first-person maze exploration) and does them all pretty poorly. But, you get to shoot cybernetic Hitler clones at the end, so that's kind of neat.
Czech archaeologists working in Egypt have discovered the tomb of a previously unknown queen. Named Khentakawess III, they are thought to have been the wife of Pharaoh Neferefre who reigned 4,500 years ago.
The discovery was made by Miroslav Barta and their team from the Czech Institute of Egyptology, reports Agence France-Presse. The tomb is located in Abu Sir, an Old Kingdom necropolis southwest of Cairo and in a location that hosts several pyramids dedicated to pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty, including Neferefre.

Prior to this discovery, archaeologists did not know that such a person even existed. Owing to inscriptions describing their name and rank on the inner walls of the tomb, they have now been identified.  They are the third to carry the name, hence the moniker Khentakawess III.
It's possible that Khentakawess was the mother of Neferefre, but the location of their tomb suggests they were their wife.

"This discovery will help us shed light on certain unknown aspects of the Fifth Dynasty, which along with the Fourth Dynasty, witnessed the construction of the first pyramids," noted Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damaty in a statement.
The tomb, which has been dated from the middle of the Fifth Dynasty (2994-2345 BCE), was found in Neferefre's funeral complex. The archaeologists also discovered other artifacts, including dozens of utensils, some of which were made from limestone and copper.

Neferefre's reign was not very long, perhaps as short as two years. They died unexpectedly in their early twenties, sometime between the age of 20 and 23.

Ben was a wounded man. Their wife divorced them to marry their lover and moved far away making it inaccessible and expensive for Ben to father their three children in a meaningful way. They defined themselves as "a man reduced to a paycheck." By the time Ben entered my office, they showed classic symptoms of depression: isolated, self-loathing, overworked, and unhappy. Yet they wanted to be a happier man and took their therapy seriously.
Conservatively, 1 in 10 men suffer from some degree of depression. But even if a man is not suffering from a clinical disorder, 10 in 10 men face fear, disappointment, anger, conflict and stress. No matter what method used or treatment pursued to help people recover from challenging or painful life experiences, many therapists, physicians, and other health care providers underutilize a very potent healing agent. It's called compassion and self-compassion. Just as the body's immune system protects against disease, compassion and self-compassion operate like an emotional immune system capable of warding off feelings of alienation, inadequacy, and even shame. By design, compassion connects and self-compassion soothes.
Compassion begins with empathy. Empathy evokes thoughts and feelings that acknowledge and connect with the suffering of others (I know how you feel). Fortified with empathy, compassion calls forth the intent and actions to help alleviate that suffering (I can relate to how you feel and I want to help you.) Self-compassion is being aware of your own suffering with an interior response that is supportive and kind rather than harsh (I made a bad mistake but I'm a good man and I can find a way to get through it).
Compassion is everywhere. Men perform countless acts of compassion on individual and grand scales. For example, a man exhausted from a day of work may drive miles to see their child play soccer. Another man spontaneously mows their elderly neighbor's lawn without seeking praise or compensation. Around the world, first responders risk their lives to save others in distress. The tragic day of September 11, 2001 is a grisly demonstration of compassion in action. Each of these acts is born of compassion and I believe compassion and self-compassion are at the core of living a healthy, happy, and connected life.

Ben's wounds of loss, anger, disappointment, and fear aroused their feelings of suffering and isolation. This self-absorption created a merry-go-round of thoughts and images that repeated their negative emotional and behavioral responses. Caught in this circular pattern, Ben unwittingly unleashed a myriad of invisible consequences. They compounded the problem by self-medicating through increased alcohol consumption and poor eating habits.
At the beginning of what turned out to be a pivotal session, Ben told me that their ex-wife's new husband, Larry, had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. They shared this news with a slight but telling smirk. Ben wanted to talk about how to be the best father to their children during this tragic ordeal. This presented me a golden opportunity to challenge a piece of their self-absorbed worldview.
"Sure," I said, "it's a great idea to discuss your fathering. Then I paused and asked him, "What kind of father do you want to be as your kids experience illness and death?"
Ben looked startled and said, "What do you mean?"
"Well," I replied, "how do you want them to know you? Do you want them to see your indifference and satisfaction at Larry's suffering?"
Ben just shook their head and said, "No."
"Then speak beyond your hurt and anger and come from a place of compassion. What might that look and feel like? What would your children see in you? This is a chance to give life to the man you talk about becoming."
Ben thought for a moment and said, "Let me get back to you on that one."
At the start of their next session, Ben handed me a letter they had sent to Larry and their ex-wife. I read it aloud:
Despite all that has happened between us, no one deserves to suffer or be deprived of living a full life. I am sorry for any grief I may have caused and I am sorry for what you both must endure. Please let me know the way I can help the two of you, especially when you need extra help with the kids.
Over time, Ben grew happier, in no small way, by embracing compassion and practicing self-compassion. They talked about cooperating with their ex-wife rather than "being in competition." Practicing self-compassion gave Ben an interior language that comforted them and strengthened their emotional resilience. Ben merged compassion and self-compassion into their masculine schema and told me, "acting more compassionately makes being a man a bit easier." Without knowing it, Ben stacked the deck in favor of living a more physically and emotionally healthy life.
