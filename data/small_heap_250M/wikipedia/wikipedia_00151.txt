The Shrine of Fatima Masumeh ( translit. haram-e fateme-ye masumeh) is located in Qom, which is considered by Shia Muslims to be the second most sacred city in Iran after Mashhad.
Fatima Masumeh was the sister of the eighth Imam Reza and the daughter of the seventh Imam Musa al-Kadhim (Tabari 60). In Shia Islam, women are often revered as saints if they are close relatives to one of the Twelver Imams. Fatima Masumeh is therefore honored as a saint, and her shrine in Qom is considered one of the most significant Shi'i shrines in Iran. Every year, thousands of Shi'i Muslims travel to Qom to honor Fatima Masumeh and ask her for blessings.
Also buried within the shrine are three daughters of the ninth Twelver Shī‘ah Imām Muhammad al-Taqī.
Specifications
The mosque consists of a burial chamber, three courtyards and three large prayer halls, totalling an area of . The three prayer halls are named: Tabātabā'ī, Bālā Sar, and A‘dham.
Visiting the Shrine
Though Shi'i theology formally states that the relatives of the Imams, or imamzadehs, hold a lower status than the Imams, popular Shi'ism still strongly venerates imamzadehs. In Iran, there are many more burial places of the Imams' relatives than there are for the Imams themselves. Imamzadehs are considered to be close to God and religiously pious because of their close relation to Imams. Shi'is commonly travel on pilgrimages to shrines of imamzadehs, such as the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh, the sister of the 8th Imam 'Ali al-Rida, in Qom, Iran. Men and women seek cures to ailments, solutions to problems, and forgiveness of sins at these sites. Many hadiths, or teachings, are recorded from Shi'i Imams praising the veneration of Fatima Masumeh, and proclaiming that those who make a pilgrimage to her Shrine will "certainly be admitted to heaven."
Fatima Masumeh's Shrine in Qom is crowded every day of the year with Shi'i men, women, and children from all around the world. Some stay for hours or days praying at the mosque and circumambulating her tomb. The economy of Qom has become reliant on this pilgrimage for the tourism it brings. In turn, Qom has remained conservative and traditional to maintain a pious environment for pilgrims. Many miracles have been recorded as taking place at this shrine, and they are documented in a special office within the shrine complex. Some are published in the shrines monthly newspaper, the Payam-e Astan.
Pilgrims at the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh follow rituals that have been passed down for centuries. Imam Ali al-Rida, Fatima Masumeh's brother, outlined these ritual acts as he described the way he visited her Shrine. The prayer Imam al-Rida dictated to his sister continues to be part of the pilgrimage. Since the Safavid period, additional rituals have been added that are now typical for many Shi'i pilgrimages including ritual washing beforehand, dressing in perfumed clothing, and entering the site with one's right foot.
History of the Shrine
Early history
Since the beginning of Qom's history in the 7th century, the city has been associated with Shi'ism and set apart from the Sunni caliphate. Many Shi'i hadiths referred to Qom as a "place of refuge for believers," calling it a deeply religious place. After Fatima Masumeh's death in Qom and the construction of her Shrine, scholars began to gather in Qom and the city gained its reputation for religious learning. Today, Qom is still noted for its religious seminaries and organizations.
Fatima Masumeh died in Qom in 201 A.H. as she travelled to join her brother, Imam Ali al-Rida in Khorasan. The caravan she travelled in was attacked in Saveh by the Abbasid Sunnis, and 23 of Fatima Masumeh's family and friends were killed (Jaffer). Fatima Masumeh was then poisoned by a woman from the Sunni enemies, fell ill, and asked to be taken to Qom, where she died. Fatima Masumeh's host in Qom buried her in his plot of land.
The style of Fatima Masumeh's Shrine has developed over many centuries. At first, her tomb was covered with a bamboo canopy. Fifty years later, this was replaced by a more durable domed building, at the request of the daughter of Imam Muhammad at-Taqī, Sayyida Zaynab. The family of Sayyida Zainab later added a further two domes to the Shrine. These architectural projects marked the beginning of female patronage of the tomb of Fatima Masumeh.
Safavid period
In 1519, Tajlu Khanum, the wife of Shah Isma'il I, led a project to improve the drainage around the Shrine, embellish the Shrine with an iwan and two minarets, and reconstruct the tomb chamber as a domed octagon. During the Safavid dynasty, the women of this family were very active in embellishing the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh. In times of war, Safavid royal women found refuge in Qom, and likely compared their situation to that of Fatima Masumeh. These women donated beautiful fabrics and other items to the Shrine. Shah Abbas I of the Safavids did not patronize the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh as much as he did other shrines of Imams, but he did offer books to the Shrine's seminary library. Over the years, many Safavids of royal birth were buried close to the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh.
Modern history
From 1795–1796, Fath-Ali Shah Qajar converted two Safavid sahn or courtyards into one large courtyard and, in 1803, fixed the golden dome. In 1883, Amin al-Sultan added the new sahn e-jadid or "New Court" to the Shrine complex.
During Ayatollah Khomeini's 1979 Iranian Revolution, Qom was named "the birthplace" of this movement. Khomeini studied in Qom and lived there at the beginning and end of the Revolution. Aspects of the culture of Qom, including the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh, were used to unite the Iranian people over significant historical and mythical events. Khomeini used images of the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh in posters, money, and stamps created during the Revolution. Khomeini also constructed an addition to the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh and added more space for pilgrims. In addition, the tomb of Ayatollah Khomeini utilizes architectural elements that are similar to Fatima Masumeh's Shrine, such as the golden dome. See Mausoleum of Khomeini.

Lucrezia Di Siena (fl. 1564), was an Italian stage actress. She is known as the first identified female actor in Italy and Europe since antiquity.
She signed a signature for an acting contract by a Commedia dell'arte theatre company in Rome on 10 October 1564, in which she is stated to be able to sing, do declamation and play music. This is the first time any professional actress is mentioned in Italy since antiquity and the first time any actress known by name to perform in Commedia dell'artre. All other members of the company were men.
She is assumed to have been a former courtisan, a cortigiana onesta, a common background for the first generation of actresses in Italy: this was a good background for an actress because courtisans of that class were normally instructed in singing, declamation, music and dance, subjects otherwise rarely attainable for women, and the fact that she was noted with no last name in combination with the honorary title Domina (a common way of address for courtesans), supports this assumption.
After this, actresses became common in Italy, and she was followed only three years later by Vincenza Armani and Barbara Flaminia.

Nawaf al-Fares () is the former Syrian ambassador to Iraq who defected from the ruling government led by Bashar al-Assad on 11o July 2012 during the Syrian uprising.
Career
Fares was a veteran of Assad's rule and held senior positions as a leading member of Syria's diplomatic corps under the late president Hafez Assad. He served as high-ranking official of the Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in Deir al Zour province. Additionally, Fares held senior security posts in Syria. He is also a former provincial governor. He served as the governor of three significant governorates, Latakia Governorate (until 2000), Idlib Governorate (appointed in 2000) and Quneitra Governorate.
He was the first Syrian ambassador to Baghdad after thirty years. His term as ambassador to Iraq began on 16 September 2008. He resigned both from the Ba'ath Party and as Syria's ambassador to Iraq on 11 July 2012.
Defection
Al Jazeera reported on 11 July 2012 that Fares had defected from the Syrian government. His defection was considered to be a significant event in regard to the future of the Syrian uprising. On the same day, Fares posted a video statement on Facebook, arguing that Syrian government forces were killing civilians and that he had joined the ranks of the revolution of the Syrian people. He further called for the members of the Syrian military to join this revolution and to save the country and the citizens. On 12 July 2012, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari told reporters in Paris that Nawaf al Fares is in Qatar.
The Syrian Foreign and Expatriates Ministry in Damascus issued a statement on 12 July 2012 dismissing Fares. The declaration stated that Fares "has been relieved of his duties" and "no longer has any link with the Syrian Embassy in Baghdad." It is further stated by the Ministry that he should be punished due to "legal and disciplinary accountability."
In his 15 July 2012 CNN interview, Fares said that he had tried to convince the Syrian government to change its approach towards the people and that foreign military intervention was needed to end the chaos in Syria. In a BBC interview, Fares warned that the Syrian government would be likely to use chemical weapons against rebels, and raised the possibility that they may have already done so.
Personal life
Fares is a Sunni Muslim from Abu Kamal, near Deir al Zor, an eastern Syrian city. His family is reported to partly be rooted in the Sunni tribe of Iraq's Anbar Province, which extends to Syria's eastern desert. Fares is reported to be the leader of a powerful clan, Al Jarrah, in the Abu Kamal area, adjacent to Iraq. Al Jarrah, is a branch of the Al Uqaydat tribal confederation, the largest in eastern Syria. The clan has nearly 1.5 million members across 40% of Syria. It also has kinship relations to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. It was powerful and prominent due to its legacy of fighting against the French forces in the 1940s, and Fares' career with the Ba'athist government.

The 2013 Buffalo Bills season was the franchise's 44th season in the National Football League and the first under head coach Doug Marrone. It was also the final season under the ownership of Ralph Wilson, who died in March 2014 at the age of 95. The team equaled their record from 2012 and missed the playoffs, increasing their playoff drought to 14 seasons. This was the first year of renewed leases on Ralph Wilson Stadium and for the Bills Toronto Series, both of which were signed in the preceding offseason. The Toronto series was originally set to expire in 2017, but was cancelled in December 2014; the lease on Ralph Wilson Stadium expires in 2022 and will presumably be the last agreement with the aging stadium, as the lease specifies that the process of exploring a new stadium begins during the lease period. The Bills also started the 2013 season with a new starting quarterback, first-round draft pick EJ Manuel, after previous starter Ryan Fitzpatrick refused a pay cut and was subsequently released.

The India Gate (formerly known as the India War Memorial) is a war memorial located astride the Rajpath on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi, formerly called Kingsway. It stands as a memorial to 84,000 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the memorial arch such as the Arch of Constantine, in Rome, and is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.
Following the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1972, a structure consisting of a black marble plinth with a reversed rifle, capped by a war helmet and bounded by four eternal flames, was built beneath the archway. This structure, called Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), has since 1971 served as India's tomb of the unknown soldier. India Gate is counted amongst the largest war memorials in India and every Republic Day, the Prime Minister visits the gate to pay their tributes to the Amar Jawan Jyoti, following which the Republic Day parade starts. India Gate is often a location for civil society protests.
India Gate
The India Gate was part of the work of the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC), which came into existence in December 1918 under the British rule for building war graves and memorials to soldiers who were killed in the First World War. The foundation stone of the gate then called the India War Memorial, was laid on 10 February 1921, at 16:30, by the visiting Duke of Connaught in a ceremony attended by Officers and Men of the British Indian Army, Imperial Service Troops, the Commander in Chief, and Chelmsford, the viceroy. On the occasion, the viceroy is reported to have said, "The stirring tales of individual heroism, will live forever in the annals of this country", and that the memorial which was a tribute to the memory of heroes, "known and unknown", would inspire future generations to endure hardships with similar fortitude and "no less valor". The Duke also read out a message by the King, which said, "On this spot, in the central vista of the Capital of India, there will stand a Memorial Archway, designed to keep", in the thoughts of future generations, "the glorious sacrifice of the officers and men of the British Indian Army who fought and fell". During the ceremony, the Deccan Horse, 3rd Sappers and Miners, 6th Jat Light Infantry, 34th Sikh Pioneers, 39th Garhwal Rifles, 59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force), 117th Mahrattas, and 5th Gurkha Rifles
Ten years after the foundation stone laying ceremony, on 12 February 1931, the memorial was inaugurated by Lord Irwin, who on occasion said "those who after us shall look upon this monument may learn in pondering its purpose something of that sacrifice and service which the names upon its walls record." In the decade between the laying of foundation stone of the memorial and its inauguration, the rail-line was shifted to run along the Yamuna River, and the New Delhi Railway Station was opened in 1926.
The gate, which is illuminated every evening from 19:00 to 21:30, today serves as one of Delhi's most important tourist attractions. Cars used to travel through the gate until it was closed to traffic. The Republic Day Parade starts from Rashtrapati Bhavan and passes around the India Gate. India gate is often a location for civil society protests, including demonstrations in response to the Nirbhaya rape case in 2012 and the Unnao rape case in 2017, and as part of the 2011 anti-corruption movement.
In 2017, the India Gate was twinned with the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester, England, another Lutyens war memorial, following a very similar design but on a smaller scale. In a ceremony, India's high commissioner to the United Kingdom laid a wreath at the arch in Leicester and the British high commissioner to India laid one at the India Gate.
Design and structure
The memorial gate was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who was not only the main architect of New Delhi but also a member of the Imperial War Graves Commission and one of Europe's foremost designers of war graves and memorials. He designed sixty-six war memorials in Europe, including the highly regarded Cenotaph in London in 1919, the first national war memorial erected after World War I, for which he was commissioned by David Lloyd George, the British prime minister. The memorial in New Delhi, like the Cenotaph in London, is a secular memorial, free of religious and "culturally-specific iconography such as crosses". Lutyens according to his biographer, Christopher Hussey, relied on the "elemental mode", a style of commemoration based on a "universal architectural style free of religious ornamentation".
The India gate, which has been called a "creative reworking of the Arc de Triomphe" has a span of 30 feet and lies on the eastern axial end of Kingsway, present-day Kartavya Path, the central vista and main ceremonial procession route in New Delhi. The -tall India gate, stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in stages to a huge moulding. The shallow domed bowl at the top was intended to be filled with burning oil on anniversaries but this is rarely done. The memorial-gate hexagon complex, with a diameter of about 625 metres, covers approximately 306,000 m2 in area.
Inscriptions
The cornice of the India Gate is inscribed with Imperial suns while both sides of the arch have INDIA, flanked by the dates MCMXIV ('1914'; on the left) and MCMXIX ('1919'; on the right). Below the word INDIA, in capital letters, is inscribed:
13,313 names are engraved out of which 12,357 are Indian. Access to read the names on the memorial is restricted, though they can be seen on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) website, which lists the names with their respective date of death, unit name, regiment, place on gate where name is inscribed, location, and other information).
Canopy
About east of the gate, at a junction of six roads, is a cupola, inspired by a sixth-century pavilion from Mahabalipuram. Lutyens used four Delhi Order columns to support the domed canopy and its chhajja.
Statue of King-Emperor George V
In the autumn of 1930, Jagatjit Singh, the Maharaja of Kapurthala State, organized an appeal amongst the Indian princely rulers to erect a statue of King-Emperor George V in New Delhi to commemorate the sovereign's recent recovery from sepsis. As originally conceived, the statue would have depicted the monarch in marble riding in a howdah atop a red stone elephant; a canopy was not then included in the design. The final concept, approved by George V before his death, dispensed with the elephant, instead incorporating a red stone canopy and pedestal, with the pedestal standing tall. An tall marble statue of the King-Emperor wearing his Delhi Durbar coronation robes and Imperial State Crown, bearing the British globus cruciger and sceptre, was placed atop the pedestal, which bore the Royal Coat of Arms and the inscription GEORGE V R I, the "R I" designating him as 'Rex Imperator' or 'King Emperor'. The combined height of the statue and pedestal was ; while the pedestal and canopy were designed by Lutyens, the statue was designed by Charles Sargeant Jagger of the Royal Academy of Arts. The canopy was topped by a gilded Tudor Crown and bore the Royal Cyphers of George V, with the completed monument intended to "mark the loyalty and attachment of the Ruling Princes and Chiefs of India to the Person and Throne of the King-Emperor." Following the premature death of Jagger, the statue's head and crown were completed by one of his assistants in England and then shipped to India, while the remainder of the monument was carved in India.
The statue's installation in the autumn of 1936, amidst the Indian independence movement, made it a target for Independence activists; on the night of 3 January 1943, during the Quit India movement, Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna and Manubhai Shah scaled the statue, smashed its nose and draped it with a large black cloth inscribed "Death to the Tyrant." The statue remained standing at its original site for two decades following the nation's independence in 1947, but certain political factions increasingly objected to its continued presence in its central location, particularly after the tenth anniversary of Independence and the centennial of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. On the night of 12–13 August 1958, the royal insignia of George V and the Tudor Crown atop the canopy were removed.
With increasing pressure from Socialist members of Parliament, then-Deputy Minister Home Affairs Lalit Narayan Mishra stated in May 1964 that all British statuary would be removed from the national capital by 1966. Two days before Independence Day in 1965, members of the Samyukta Socialist Party overpowered two constables guarding the site, covered the statue in tar and defaced its imperial crown, nose and one ear, also leaving a photo of Subhas Chandra Bose at the monument. Despite the resulting adverse publicity and the growing controversy over the situation, the matter of relocating the statue dragged on for several years. The British government rejected a proposal to repatriate the monument to the United Kingdom, citing the lack of an appropriate site and sufficient funds, while the British High Commission in New Delhi declined to have the statue relocated to their compound, due to limited space. Efforts to move the statue to a Delhi park were strongly opposed by the nationalist Bharatiya Jana Sangh, which then held power in the city. Finally, in late 1968, the statue was removed from its position beneath the canopy and briefly placed in storage before being moved to Delhi's Coronation Park, where it joined other British Raj-era statues. During and after the statue's removal, it was often suggested that a statue of Mahatma Gandhi be placed under the canopy. The suggestion was even discussed in the Indian Parliament. In 1981, the government had in response to a question in the Parliament, confirmed that it was considering the installation of a Gandhi statue under the empty canopy, but nothing came of it.
Subhas Chandra Bose statue
On 21 January 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that a statue of Subhas Chandra Bose would be installed in the canopy at India Gate. The announcement came two days before his 125th birth anniversary. A 28 feet high and 6 feet wide 3D holographic statue of Bose is inaugurated at the site on 23 January 2022, celebrated as Parakram Diwas (Courage Day). On this occasion, an award in the name of Bose has also been instituted for the exemplary work in disaster management. On 8 September 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the newly-made statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose near the India Gate.
Amar Jawan Jyoti
Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the flame of the immortal soldier, is a structure consisting of black marble plinth, with reversed rifle, capped by war helmet, bound by four urns, each with the permanent light (jyoti) from compressed natural gas flames, erected under the India gate to commemorate Indian soldiers martyred in the war of the liberation of Bangladesh in December 1971. It was inaugurated by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 26 January 1972, the twenty-third Indian Republic Day.
Since the installation of the Amar Jawan Jyoti, it has served as India's tomb of the unknown soldier. It is staffed around the clock by the Indian armed forces. Wreaths are placed at the Amar Jawan Jyoti every Republic Day, Vijay Diwas, and Infantry Day by the Prime Minister and the Chiefs of the Armed Forces.
On 21 January 2022 the Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate was merged with the Amar Jawan Jyoti at the National War Memorial.
National War Memorial
In July 2014, the government announced plans to construct a National War Memorial in the C-Hexagon (India Gate Circle), and an adjoining National War Museum. The cabinet allocated for the project. The National War Memorial was completed in January, 2019. Since January 2022, it houses the Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the "Flame of the Immortal Soldier".

Glen Rock–Boro Hall is one of two railroad stations operated by New Jersey Transit in the borough of Glen Rock, Bergen County, New Jersey, United States on the Bergen County Line. Its name comes from the fact that the Glen Rock Municipal Building is located immediately east of the station, and to differentiate it from the Glen Rock–Main Line station, which lies two blocks west on Rock Road (County Route 134).
History
The station opened on October 1, 1881 as Paramus. The station was renamed in 1891.
Station layout
The station has two tracks, each with a low-level side platform. Although the platforms are not high-level, Boro Hall is handicap accessible via use of two ramps, one on either side of the platform.
Pedestrian access to both platforms is available along Rock Road, and from a pedestrian underpass on Maple Avenue and the entrance to the station's parking lot on Glen Avenue. Paid parking is available by use of a ticket machine system; previously the borough employed parking meters.
The Boro Hall station is located three blocks from the Main Line station in Glen Rock.

Guido Nonveiller (5 June 1913, Rijeka Belgrade – 7 April 2002) was a Croatian entomologist, FAO expert and professor at the University of Belgrade. He fought in the International Brigades and French Forces of the Interior during World War II. In 1989 he was inducted as a Commander of the l'Ordre des Palmes Académiques. He was known for his political and scientific activism and perhaps as the world authority for the African and Palaearctic Mutillidae (velvet ants).
Life
His father Lino Nonveiller was a chemical engineer that travelled through Europe and educated Guido and his sister in Rijeka, Vienna and Split. In 1927, he was introduced to Peter Novak, an early Croatian entomologist, who made a lasting impact on the young boy and stimulated a lifelong passion for insects. At sixteen (1929) he discovered his first new insect species on Biokovo mountains. The same year it was named after him - Trechus nonveilleri by Giuseppe Miller from Trieste.
In his early twenties, during probation work at the University of Belgrade, he engaged in different students movements that led him to fight in the Spanish Civil War and World War II. He was an officer in the International Brigades from 1937 until he was captured after Franco's victory in April 1939 and incarcerated in the prison of Castres. He escaped in 1942 with 36 other Brigadists and joined the French Resistance. After the war from 1944 to 1945, he was appointed at the Yugoslav Embassy in France.
In 1945, he returned to the University of Belgrade, where he taught from 1946 to 1960. He founded and directed for ten years the Federal Institute for Plant Protection of Yugoslavia. He also held a head of the Plant Protection Services and the Yugoslav Federal Ministry from 1947 to 1949. From 1960 to 1962 he worked in Tunisia as plant protection officer, and from 1962 to 1985 as United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization expert in Yaounde, Cameroon.
In 1989 he was inducted as a Commander of the l'Ordre des Palmes Académiques, the highest level of the academic honor given out by the French government. From 1992 to 1996, in his early eighties, he moved to Paris to work at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle and published over 20 papers on his work on Lepidoptera.
In 1996 the Spanish government recognized his endeavours to defend the Republic and declared him an honorary citizen of Spain. The same year, Jacques Chirac, then French President, granted him the legal status of former service personnel ("anciens combattants").
In 2006 the Croatian Entomological society named their bibliographical database Nonveilleriana in his memory.
Work
Nonveiller was internationally renowned for researching the African and Palaearctic Mutillidae and Bradynobaenidae (Hymenoptera), a leading specialist for several groups of Coleoptera of the Balkans and adjacent areas and a prominent expert in economic entomology and historiography of his time. During his 13-year-long stay in Cameroon he was one of the first proponents of the Integrated pest management.
In the late 1980, despite his age, Nonveiller was among the world pioneers in application of personal computers in entomology. He started with Commodore 64 in 1983.
Publications
Nonveiller wrote and published in German, French, English, Italian, Spanish and Serbo-Croatian, resulting in more than 150 publications, description of 33 new general/subgenera and over 330 new species-group taxa assembling one of the world's largest collection of African Mutillidae including more than 120,000 specimens collected by himself and his wife Nadezda in Cameroon.

Adolf Brütt (10 May 1855 in Husum – 6 November 1939 in Bad Berka) was a German sculptor. He was the founder of the Weimarer Bildhauerschule (Weimar Sculpture School) and its accompanying bronze foundry.
Biography
Brütt originally trained in Kiel as a stonemason and worked on several projects, including Schloss Linderhof. A stipend from the Sparkasse Kiel (a saving and loan institution) enabled him to study at the Prussian Academy of Art, where he graduated in 1878. He became a master student of the sculptor Leopold Rau (1847–1880), and worked in the Munich studios of Karl Begas, brother of the Neo-Baroque sculptor Reinhold Begas.
In 1883 he married and opened his own studio. He became a member of the Munich Secession in 1893. His sculpture Sword Dancer won a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle (1900) and secured his international reputation. He later became a Professor at the Prussian Academy and taught at the Fehr Academy, a private school in Berlin devoted to the ideals of the Secession founded by Conrad Fehr in 1892. Together with his friend, the banker Felix Koenigs, he helped to promote the Secession through exhibits at the National Gallery, which included works by Auguste Rodin and the French impressionists.
In 1905, he was appointed a Professor at the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School, where he created the school for sculpture and bronze casting. Together with his students, he created the marble reliefs in the lobby of the new Court Theater in Weimar.
In 1910, he returned to Berlin and was succeeded at Weimar by Gottlieb Elster. His statue of the "Sword Dancer" was moved from Kiel to Berlin for the 1916 Summer Olympics. In 1928, he became an Honorary Citizen of Bad Berka. In 1996, his sculpture school became part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Selected works

Yagong Island (; ) is an island in the Crescent Group (Yongle Qundao 永乐环礁) of the Paracel Islands, in the South China Sea. It is also known as "He Ducks", (male duck), due to its shape. It is located a few hundred metres southwest of Observation Bank (Silver Islet, Yin Yu (), Bãi Xà Cừ) in the northeast of the Crescent Group.
It is occupied by the PRC, and like all of the other Paracel islands, it is controlled by China (PRC) and claimed by Taiwan (ROC) and Vietnam.
It is administered as the "Yagong Community", a village-level division of the Yongxing Dao Neighborhood Committee township-level division, in the county-level division of the Xisha District, of the Sansha prefecture-level city, in the Hainan province.
It has an area of just under 1 hectare () and a residential population of about 100 fishermen with solar power and a desalination plant.
Prior to 2013 the island was a barren stretch of coral and clamshells surrounding a central lagoon, providing a temporary stopover and resting place for fishermen. In 2013 the PRC shipped 120 tonnes of soil, 200 tonnes of fresh water, coconut fibre, and 400 trees to the island as part of a Sansha-wide greening project. As of 2013, regular tourist visits were made to the island by a cruise line, which also supplies the 78 registered (in 2016) residents with groceries.

John Dawson Dewhirst (1952 – c. August 1978) was a British teacher and amateur yachtsman who was one of nine westerners, and two Britons, known to have been killed by the Khmer Rouge during the rule of Pol Pot.
Early life
Dewhirst was born in the Jesmond district of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1952. His father was a headmaster, and his mother ran an antiques shop. In 1963, at age 11, the Dewhirst family moved to Cumbria. While growing up in Cumbria, Dewhirst became a sports enthusiast, and took a liking to outdoor activities. He spent most of his boyhood roaming the Cumbrian countryside.
At Appleby Grammar School, Dewhirst developed a love for poetry and aspired to be a novelist. After finishing his A Levels, he won an English scholarship to study at Loughborough University. While studying at Loughborough University, he trained as a teacher. After receiving his degree in teaching, his desire for adventure and to become a writer led him to travel to Tokyo, Japan to teach English in 1977. Dewhirst also worked for The Japan Times from June 1977 to January 1978.
Disappearance
Some time in July 1978, while visiting a friend in the eastern Malaysian town of Kuala Terengganu, and en route from Japan back to England, Dewhirst met Canadian Stuart Glass and New Zealander Kerry Hamill, co-owners of a little Malaysian bedar named Foxy Lady. The three spent several weeks or a month together in Kuala Terengganu, and then headed north to Bangkok. For reasons that are unclear, Foxy Lady ended up in Cambodian waters and was seized, off Koh Tang, by a patrol vessel attached to Division 164 of the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea. Foxy Lady may have been on its way to Bangkok to pick up a load of Thai sticks. Glass had engaged in hashish smuggling before. Dewhirst's history in this area is unknown. His Kuala Terengganu friend has recalled Dewhirst speaking of planned adventures. Glass was shot and killed, or drowned, during the seizure. Dewhirst and Hamill may have been held for several days on a nearby island, and were then taken to the interrogation centre of S-21.
S-21 records
In early 1979, Vietnam defeated Democratic Kampuchea and overthrew the Pol Pot regime. They liberated Democratic Kampuchea's S-21 prison in the capital Phnom Penh where an estimated 20,000 people (the real number is unknown) had been sent for torture and execution (or taken to the Killing Fields for execution after being tortured), many of them for supposedly spying against Cambodia. Alleged photographs and forced confessions of nine missing Western yachtsmen (four Americans, two Australians, plus those of John Dewhirst and Kerry Hamill) were found in the prison files. The confessions of Dewhirst and Hamill revealed that they had been seized by a Khmer Rouge patrol vessel near the island of Koh Tang on the evening of 13 August 1978. Stuart Glass, the Canadian befriended by Dewhirst and Hamill, had been shot and killed during Foxy Ladys capture. Hamill and Dewhirst were both brought ashore and then taken by truck to Phnom Penh. Like the other Western yachtsmen, they were almost certainly tortured. The extent of their mistreatment is not clear. Dewhirst wrote several long confessions that mixed true events in his life with false accounts of his career as a CIA agent planning to subvert the Khmer Rouge regime. He claimed that his father (also an agent) had been paid a large bribe for inducting his son into the CIA and that his college course in Loughborough was interspersed with training as a spy. Dewhirst and Hamill signed a series of confessions between 3 September and 13 October 1978. The former administrator of the prison, Kang Kek Iew (also known as "Comrade Duch"), said that he remembered Dewhirst as "very polite".
News of his death
The circumstances of the deaths of Dewhirst and Hamill remain unclear. Their deaths were first reported in late 1979 and early 1980 by ABC News journalist Jim Laurie and freelance photographer Edward Rasen. Rasen provided more details, including photographs and portions of confessions in stories for the UK publication NOW! and the Australian Bulletin.
During the 2009 trial of S-21 chief Kang Kek Iew, a former S-21 guard named Cheam Sour claimed that one of the eight Western yachtsmen held at S-21 was burned to death. Sensational reports that this individual was Dewhirst are unsubstantiated. Like other S-21 inmates, Dewhirst may well have been killed with a blow to the head. Kang Kek Iew said that he received orders from his superiors that the bodies of the murdered westerners had to be burned to remove all traces of their remains, adding, "I believe that nobody would dare to violate my orders".
Aftermath
On 10 November 2005, in an interview, Dewhirst's sister, Hilary Dewhirst-Holland told interviewers that she wants her brother's case to be detailed in the prosecution indictment against Kang Kek Iew.
During Kang Kek Iew's trial beginning in 2007, Hillary did not attend the trial to testify against Kang Kek Iew. Instead, she handed a note to Rob Hamill, younger brother of Kerry Hamill, to share with the court.
On 27 August 2009, Rob Hamill appeared before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) as a civil party in Case 001, against Kang Kek Iew. In April 2011, Hamill applied to the ECCC once more for civil party status in ECCC Case 003, believed to involve former Khmer Rouge chief Meas Mut. As "Secretary" of Democratic Kampuchea's Division 164, comprising the country's navy, Mut would have been responsible for the gunning down of Stuart Glass and the seizure of Foxy Lady's two other crew, Kerry Hamill and John Dewhirst, as well as the arrest of the other six Western yachtsmen.

Duchesses, previously known as M van der Merwe XI, are a South African women's cricket team that compete in the Women's T20 Super League. The team has no geographical base, instead being made up of some of the best players from across South Africa. They are captained by Suné Luus and coached by Martelize van der Merwe. Their best T20 Super League finish came in the first edition of the tournament, 2019, when they were runners-up.
History
Duchesses were first formed in 2019 to compete in the Women's T20 Super League, a tournament designed to provide more competitive cricket to the best players in South Africa. For the first edition of the tournament, the side was named after its coach, Martelize van der Merwe, becoming M van der Merwe XI. They were captained by Suné Luus. M van der Merwe XI won two of their three matches in the first tournament, therefore finishing second overall. Batter Lizelle Lee was the second leading run-scorer in the tournament, including hitting 92* in the opening match of the competition.
For the following edition of the tournament, which took place two months later in December 2019, the side was named Duchesses. Luus and van der Merwe were retained as captain and coach, respectively. The side again won two of their three matches, and finished third overall on Net Run Rate.
The third edition of the tournament took place in December 2020. Martelize van der Merwe remained as coach of the side, and retained Luus as captain in the draft that took place prior to the competition, as well as picking fellow South Africa stars Mignon du Preez and Sinalo Jafta. Duchesses won one match in the tournament, beating Starlights by just one run, but finished bottom of the table on Net Run Rate. Luus was the leading run-scorer in the tournament, with 150 runs including two half-centuries.

Reuben J. Ursella (January 11, 1890 – February 1980) was a professional football player-coach who played during the early years of the National Football League. During his NFL career Rube played for the Minneapolis Marines, Akron Indians, Hammond Pros, Minneapolis Red Jackets and the Rock Island Independents. In January 1926, he also played exhibition games with Jim Thorpe and his independent team, the Tampa Cardinals. Ursella played college football for the University of Minnesota.
Biography
Rube began his professional football career in 1907 with the Minneapolis Marines. Rube Ursella was the true superstar of the team and had a long and successful pro football career with the Marines. He was both an offensive and defensive standout, as well as a skilled kicker and punter. Pro football shut down completely in 1918, due to the 1918 flu pandemic. In 1919 Walter Flanigan, the manager of the Rock Island Independents, was able to lure Ursella away from the Marines. With Rube came several other players as well as their offense which became known as "the Minnesota Shift". The team lost only one game that season, to the Hammond Pros. In 1921 Rube returned to the Marines, however the team was unable to play up to its previous level. He returned for two more seasons with the Independents in 1924 and 1925.
In January 1926, Rube joined the Tampa Cardinals a team put together by Jim Thorpe for the purpose of playing exhibition games in Florida. The team lost a New Year's Day game to Red Grange and the Chicago Bears and afterward played a series of games against the Millville Big Blue, playing under the banner of the Haven-Villa of Winter Haven.
During the 1926 season, Rube played for the Akron Indians and Hammond Pros before retiring at the end of the season. He returned in 1929 to play for the Minneapolis Red Jackets before retiring, for good, after that season.

Dan and Nick: The Wildebeest Years was a BBC Radio 4 comedy series originally broadcast in seven episodes in 1998. The Dan and Nick of the title are Dan Freedman and Nick Romero, who often appeared on Loose Ends.
A follow-up series of a further six episodes was made, this time called Forty Nights in the Wildebeest. Both series have been re-broadcast on BBC 7 during 2006 and 2007.
The characteristic feature of Dan and Nick's style is the heavy use of puns. Indeed, the frequency of puns incorporated into these programmes has rarely been matched since I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again.
Themes
The shows premise centred on short sketches and songs performed in a cabaret style. Dan and Nick had a supporting band, 'The Gents' who would accompany them on musical sections. Typical sketches included lampooning films, music, and other popular culture. The "Britishness" of the show was reflected in the interest in subjects such as the royal family, and Radio 4, the station on which it was broadcast, with a fascination for characters such as Brian Perkins. And the program itself owes much to forerunners of the radio comedy genre, such as Round the Horne, I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, and The Navy Lark. Other shows since, such as Dead Ringers could also be said to have been influenced by it. Some recurring jokes were:
Incy Wincy Quincy, a spider pathologist, obviously lifted from TV-show Quincy, M.E.;
Tossed in Space, a satire of Lost in Space about trapped salad items in space;
censorship gags, for example, reading football scores while bleeping out any innocuous sounding words, including from the middle of words;
The Annals of History and The Century's Passage, a humorous and satirical look back through historic events;
Robin Would, a gay and camp version of Robin Hood with guest Richard Coles playing the lead, whose catchphrase was "What would you have me do? Live a lie?";
The Big Fact Hunt (always pronounced very carefully), another excuse to introduce as many one liner as possible on a particular theme.
Forty Nights in the Wildebeest
Forty Nights in the Wildebeest was the name of a follow-up series of six programmes, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in the year 2000. It followed a similar format to The Wildebeest Years: a quick-fire mixture of pun-laden short sketches and musical numbers.
The second show in the series was recorded at the Edinburgh Festival. Sketches included Hong Feng Shui and a musical number by Right Said Freud
A running gag in the series was a Radio 4 -style announcer saying:
"And now, the radio foreplay. <pause> I'm sorry, I'll read that again. <pause> And now, the Radio 4 play."
It is likely they were also paying homage to the granddaddy of pun-based radio comedy, I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again.

μ Fornacis (Latinised as Mu Fornacis) is the Bayer designation for a star in the southern constellation of Fornax. With an apparent visual magnitude of 5.27, it is visible to the naked eye. The distance to this star, as determined by its annual parallax shift of 10.18 mas, is around 320 light years.
This is an A-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of A0 V. It is a Be star that displays "central quasi emission" (CQE) bumps in its spectrum due to a surrounding shell of material. The star has an estimated 3.1 times the mass of the Sun and 2.5 times the Sun's radius. Mu Fornacis is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 320 km/s and is around 188 million years old. It radiates 68.7 times the solar luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 11,745 K.
Mu Fornacis appears to be emitting an infrared excess at a wavelength of 22 μm, which could be due to an orbiting debris disk.

The Caspian lowland desert ecoregion (WWF ID: PA1308) is an ecoregion that covers the north and southeast coasts of the Caspian Sea, including the deltas of the Volga River and Ural River in the northern region. While the region gets relatively low amounts of precipitation (less than 200 mm/year), wildlife is supported by the river estuaries and the sea itself. The wetlands are an internationally important area for bird nesting and migratory resting. The ecoregion is in the Palearctic realm, and the deserts and xeric shrublands biome. It has an area of .
Location and description
The ecoregion is approximately contained within the Caspian Depression, a sunken geological region feeding in to the Caspian, the surface of which is itself at below worldwide sea level. The northern section is almost 900 km wide, and stretches up to 300 km inland across Russia and Kazakhstan. The sector along the southeast coast of the Caspian is mostly in Turkmenistan. Elevations throughout the ecoregion range between -28 and +100 meters. The dry areas were once underwater, but as the sea has slowly receded the dry areas have revealed a landscape of sand dunes, ridges, salt domes, salt pans ('shors'), and clay deserts ('takyrs').
Climate
The climate of the ecoregion is represented by that in the Volga delta, in the Astrakhan Nature Reserve, where the climate is cool semi-arid (Köppen climate classification BSk). This climate is characterized by high variation in temperature, both daily and seasonally; with low precipitation. Average annual precipitation in the Caspian lowlands is 198 mm. Average temperature in January is , and in July is
Flora and fauna
Both dry steppe and coastal wetland floral communities are supported in this ecoregion. The vegetation on the southeast coast in Turkmenistan is relatively sparse, but notable for hosting specialized shrub and semi-shrub halophytes ('salt-loving plants'). Examples include sagebrushes (Artemisia) and tetyr (Salsola gemmascens). The latter is a shrub that reaches in height.
The Caspian coast is an internationally significant nesting and migratory area for gulls, terns, and other waterfowl in the Asia-Europe migration paths. The birds that cross the area twice a year number in the tens of millions. Over 200,000 of the Eurasian Coot (Fulica atra) winter in the southern Hazar Reserve.
Protections
A 2017 assessment found that 3,838 km², or 1%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. 38% of the ecoregion's area is relatively intact habitat.
There are several significant nationally protected area that reach into this ecoregion:
Astrakhan Nature Reserve, protecting three sections of the islands and marshes of the Volga River delta
Chyornye Zemli Nature Reserve, protecting natural steppe and semi-desert ecosystems of the 'black earth' region of the Caspian lowlands
Hazar State Nature Reserve, an ornithological reserve on the southeast coast of the Caspian Sea, in Turkmenistan.

In 1987 he joined the newly formed CREOL (Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers) at the University of Central Florida, where he was professor of physics and electrical and computer engineering. The National Science Foundation has funded him for the past 29 years, and he has been performing research for the Department of Defense for a similar period. His current research interests are in the characterization of the nonlinear optical properties of materials and their temporal response as well as the applications of these nonlinear materials properties for sensor protection, switching, beam control etc. He helped develop the Z-scan technique with Mansoor Sheik-Bahae with whom he also established the methodology for applying Kramers-Kronig relations to ultrafast nonlinearities. This also led to the understanding of cascaded second-order nonlinearities.
He is a fellow of the Optical Society of America, a former member of their board of directors and co-chair of the Science and Engineering Council, a fellow of the SPIE, senior member of the Laser Institute of America and a former board member, a fellow of IEEE LEOS and a member of the APS, and MRS. He also served as a topical editor for Optics Letters. He has graduated 25 Ph.D.s and published well in excess of 100 papers. In 2003 he was awarded the highest honor UCF bestows, the Pegasus Award.
He was director of the School of Optics/CREOL from July 1999 to May 2004. With the elevation of the School to the first College of Optics and Photonics, he became the dean of the college and served in that capacity until 2009. In addition Governor Jeb Bush established the Florida Photonics Center of Excellence (FPCE) in 2003 and he is the director of that center along with CREOL, both centers within the college.

Salpul (also called Salpu and Juan Salpú) was a northern, or guennekenk, Tehuelche leader in the late 19th century in Patagonia, Argentina. He allied with the tribes of Sayhueque, Inacayal, and Foyel (the last Patagonian indigenous chieftains who refused to recognize the Argentine government). They fought against the Argentine Army during the Conquest of the Desert.
In 1897, Salpul and a shaman named Cayupil (Caypül) tried to organize an uprising against the government. Their activities were quickly discovered by the authorities. Salpul was arrested and taken to Buenos Aires, but he was released within a month and returned home. Afterward he allied his people with the tribe of his relative Juan Sacamata. Between the 1890s and 1900, both lived in Nueva Lubecka, located in the Genoa Valley, Chubut province. Salpul died some years later in Pastos Blancos, near the Senguerr river.

The Krasukha (; English: Belladonna or Deadly Nightshade) is a Russian mobile, ground-based, electronic warfare (EW) system. This system is produced by the KRET corporation on different wheeled platforms. The Krasukha's primary targets are airborne radio-electronics (such as UAVs) and airborne systems guided by radar. The Krasukha has multiple applications in the Russian Armed Forces.
Krasukha-2
The Krasukha-2 aims to jam AWACS at ranges of up to .
The Krasukha-2 can also jam other airborne radars, such as those for radar-guided missiles. The missiles, once jammed, then receive a false target away from the original to ensure that the missiles no longer pose a threat. The Krasukha-2 guards mobile high-priority targets such as the 9K720 Iskander SRBM.
Krasukha-4
The Krasukha-4 broadband multifunctional jamming station is mounted on a BAZ-6910-022 four-axle-chassis. Like the Krasukha-2, the Krasukha-4 counters AWACS and other airborne radar systems. The Krasukha-4 has the range effectively to disrupt low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and can cause permanent damage to targeted radio-electronic devices. Ground based radars are also a viable target for the Krasukha-4.

Russian Ground Forces
Libyan National Army
Operational history
Krasukha jammers were reportedly deployed to support Russian forces in Syria. They have reportedly been blocking small U.S. surveillance drones from receiving GPS satellite signals. During the Turkish intervention in the Syrian civil war, the complex apparently destroyed a Bayraktar drone by causing it to lose control, subsequently crashing.
In July 2018, an OSCE monitoring mission drone recorded a 1L269 Krasukha-2 among other electronic warfare equipment deployed near Chornukhyne, Ukraine.
In 2020, Krasukha was reportedly operating around the Russian military base at Gyumri in Armenia to counter the use by Azerbaijan of Turkish-made Bayraktar armed drones as well as Israel-made Harop loitering munition (suicide drones).
The first export contract was officially signed in August 2021.
Krasukha-4 models are also being employed in the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, as Ukrainian forces captured one of these devices in the field near Kyiv. A photograph posted to social media claims to show part of the system, which has been separated from its truck mount and shows some damage. The unit was then sent to the United States for examination.

"Don't Tell Me the Time" is a song by American singer-songwriter Martha Davis, which was released in 1987 as the lead single from her debut solo studio album Policy. The song was written by Davis and produced by Richie Zito. "Don't Tell Me the Time" peaked at number 80 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 8 on the Australian Kent Music Report chart.
Background
Speaking of the song's message, Davis commented in 1987, "I think everyone has been there at some point or other, even if it's only in our imaginations where you're in a situation where you're feeling like you've been done wrong. I have a thing about jealousy; I'm not really a jealous person by nature, but what I can't stand is like if somebody thinks I'm stupid enough not to figure something out. It's the anger, the frustration, the sadness and just all the emotions that go along with feeling like you've been done wrong. It's not directly related to any particular incident I can cite. It has happened to me, I think it's happened to a lot of people."
Music video
The song's music video was directed by David Fincher and produced Kim Dempster for Propaganda Films. It achieved breakout rotation on MTV and medium rotation on VH1.
Critical reception
On its release, Billboard described "Don't Tell Me the Time" as an "aching piece of neo-'60s pop" which is "adorned with Davis' distinctive and emotion-laden vocal". They concluded that the track has "quite an impact". Cash Box praised it as an "impressive pop outing" and added that it "should cause quite a stir". The Gavin Report felt Davis "is sure to book plenty of airplay in A/C radio with this one". They added, "It's a song about time and temperature where the moment has passed and there's a chill in the air."

Landau Forte Academy QEMS (Formerly "Queen Elizabeth's Mercian School", until 1 September 2011) is an 11-16 secondary school with academy status located to the north of Tamworth, a market town in Staffordshire in the Midlands north of Birmingham. It is often known simply as QEMS (pronounced "quems").
Since 1 September 2011, the school has been owned and operated by the Landau Forte Charitable Trust, after being transferred from the Staffordshire LA control.
It is situated in Perrycrofts, on the eastern side of the A513, at the junction with the B5493 (former A453), around a half-mile north of Tamworth town centre.
Specialist status
As a state school, it was awarded specialist status to teach as a Music College. QEMS gained status as a Specialist Music College, under the UK Government's Specialist Schools scheme, in 2005. This specialist status also gives funding to other departments, most notably ICT.
History
Grammar school
It was the Queen Elizabeth Grammar School on Ashby Road, a co-educational grammar school.
Comprehensive
It became a comprehensive in 1979, merging with Mercian Boys' School, a secondary modern school which moved from Hospital Street in 1960. The school was renamed Queen Elizabeth's Mercian School, a combination of the two schools' names. The "Mercian" in the school name refers to the fact that Tamworth was the headquarters of the Anglo-Saxon province of Mercia.
In April 2008, two teachers and seven pupils were injured by a bottle of silicon tetrachloride.
Arson
In November 2004, a 16-year boy was convicted of arson and sentenced for four years at Stafford Crown Court. He started a fire at the school on Sunday 13 April 2003, causing £1.73 million in damage. Petrol had been poured through a window of room 353 to start the fire. Chase Terrace Technology College had been burnt down the year before, costing £8 million. Six fire engines were in attendance, from Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service and Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service, with fifty firemen. Six classrooms and an assembly hall were destroyed.
Former teachers
Prof Geoffrey Bullough, Professor of English Language and Literature from 1946-68 at King's College London (taught English from 1924-6)
Campus
QEMS is based in several buildings across the school. Overall, there are six buildings (Main Block, DT, RE, Middle Block, Elizabeth Block, Girls' Gym) and mostly each department is based in one of the buildings.
Building Schools for the Future (BSF)
Along with all of the other secondary schools in Tamworth, QEMS was due to be rebuilt under the Government's BSF scheme. The addition of a Sixth-Form Academy meant that the size of the QEMS site would have been reduced, and centralised. The first stage of building work was due to begin by March 2010, but was scrapped in July 2010. Nonetheless, the school was transferred to the Landau Forte Charitable Trust's control, effective 1 September 2011, as part of a bid to receive investment from the Government to replace the lost BSF money.

The Sackler Library holds a large portion of the classical, art historical, and archaeological works belonging to the University of Oxford, England.
History
The Sackler Library building was completed in 2001 and opened on 24 September of that year, enabling the rehousing of the library of the Ashmolean Museum. The library entrance is at 1 St John Street. It was principally funded by a donation from the multi-millionaire Mortimer Sackler. It was designed by Robert Adam with Paul Hanvey of ADAM Architecture. Its main building is a circular drum, a reference to the Classical origins of many of its holdings. One of the outer walls of the drum is decorated by a Classical frieze. The architects claim the circular entrance vestibule is derived from the Doric Temple of Apollo at Bassae, first excavated by Charles Robert Cockerell, the architect who designed the adjacent Ashmolean Museum. The Sackler library is administered as part of the multi-site Bodleian Library, the central libraries of the University of Oxford
Controversy
It is a controversial building (like many associated with the university) as the wealth of the eponymous funders, the Sackler family, was raised in large part from marketing Oxycontin, leading to the US opioid crisis, which has killed hundreds of thousands in the US alone. In 2018, the university said that “[We] would consider any public controversy surrounding a donor [and] may reconsider a donor in the light of new information. At present, there is no intention to reconsider the Sackler family and trusts.”
Collections
Its holdings incorporate the collections of four older libraries, namely the Ashmolean library, the Classics Lending Library, the Eastern Art Library, the Griffith Institute and the History of Art Library. Major subject areas are:
Western European Art since c. AD 1000
History of Art
Classical and Byzantine art and archaeology
Papyrology and Greco-Roman Egypt
Near Eastern archaeology and cuneiform languages
Egyptology and Coptic
Ancient history
Epigraphy
Classical languages and literature
Prehistoric archaeology of Europe and North Africa
Archaeology of Roman provinces
Medieval European archaeology
Theoretical and scientific archaeology
Numismatics
Among the celebrated holdings are the Heracles Papyrus, a fragment of 3rd century Greek manuscript containing a poem about the Labours of Heracles, along with over 100,000 fragments found at Oxyrhynchus known as the Oxyrhynchus Papyri.

Flektor was a web application that allowed users the ability to create and “mashup” their own content (photos, videos, music, etc.) and share it via email, on social networking websites MySpace, Facebook, Blogger, Digg, eBay or on personal blogs. The company's website (Flektor.com) launched on April 2, 2007 and over 40,000 people began utilizing its features just one month later. Flektor closed down in January 2009.
Flektor offered tools and widgets that included audio, video, photos, text, and approximately 100 effects, transitions and filters to be used with media. Users could create personalized slideshows, polls, postcards, and streaming video projects which the website calls "fleks." Flektor also offered Chat (used as a MySpace addon) and Movie Editor, which provided the ability to edit content and assets together. Users of Flektor could import media from websites like Photobucket and Google's YouTube, and then edit their content with the site's editing tools.
Flektor's erstwhile competitors include Slide.com (founded by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin), RockYou!, Yahoo's JumpCut and Brightcove.
History
Flektor was created by Jason Rubin, Andy Gavin and former HBO executive Jason R. Kay. Both Rubin and Gavin spent most of their careers in the video game industry developing games for publishers like Electronic Arts, Universal Interactive Studios and Sony Computer Entertainment America. They founded a successful game development studio called Naughty Dog and were responsible for games such as Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter. After selling Naughty Dog to Sony, Rubin focused on a comic book series called Iron and the Maiden before teaming up again with Gavin to venture into the web industry with Flektor.
Jason Kay spent four years at Home Box Office, working as a consultant to the EVP of Business Development. They recruited former employee and then Naughty Dog Lead Programmer Scott Shumaker to lead the technology team along with Gavin. Ryan Evans joined shortly thereafter, spearheading product development.
Flektor is based in Culver City, California.
In May 2007, the company was sold to Fox Interactive Media, which is a division of News Corp., for more than $20 million. The deal coincided with Fox's acquisition of Photobucket, an image-hosting and sharing website. Fox Interactive Media already holds possession of MySpace, IGN Entertainment, FOXSports.com, AmericanIdol.com and Rotten Tomatoes. After the acquisition, Rubin, Gavin and Kay departed, leaving the studio in the hands of Shumaker and Evans.
In the fall of 2007, Flektor partnered with its sister company, MySpace, and MTV to provide instant audience feedback via polls for the interactive MySpace/ MTV Presidential Dialogues series with presidential candidates Senator Barack Obama, Senator John McCain and John Edwards. Use of Flektor's polling system, enabled hosts John McLaughlin and Geoffrey Garin to cater their questions towards subjects of voter-interest.
In the fall of 2008, Flektor built the official site for the 2008 Presidential debates, hosted at MyDebates.
In January 2009, due to a company directive to focus on the core MySpace property, Fox Interactive announced that Flektor would be shut down, with some of its technology being incorporated into MySpace.

Egypt–Iran relations refers to the current and historical relations between Egypt and Iran. Following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, Iran appointed its first ambassador to Egypt in almost 30 years. Despite oft-wavering tensions between the two countries, they share membership in the OIC and the Developing 8.
According to a 2013 BBC World Service poll, 15% of Egyptians view Iran's influence positively, with 48% expressing a negative view.
In a 2012 poll conducted by the Israel Project where 812 Egyptians were questioned about Iran's nuclear programs, 61% of the 812 individuals expressed support for the Iranian nuclear program.
History
Egypt was occupied by the Achaemenid and Sassanid Persian Empires during ancient times.
Despite sharing the Shia faith, Fatimid Egypt and Buyid Iran had unfriendly relations due to conflicting interests over Syria and Jazira. Both later declined under the pressure of the Seljuk Turks. Following the 1258 Sack of Baghdad, the Sunni Caliphs found asylum in Mamluk Egypt. The Ilkhanate Mongols, based in Iran, fought many wars with the Mamluks even after converting to Islam.
In the 15th century, Mamluk Egypt and Iran under the Aq Qoyunlu Padishah continued to clash in Upper Mesopotamia, culminating in the Battle of Urfa after a similar Iranian advance into Egyptian dependencies in the decade before. However, attitudes changed when Ottoman expansion tipped the balance of power in the Middle East. The Ottomans invaded Egypt once a Safavid-Mamluk alliance seemed imminent.
In 1939, diplomatic relations between Egypt and Iran were upgraded to ambassadorial level, and Youssef Zulficar Pasha was appointed as Egypt's first ambassador in Tehran. In the same year, Princess Fawzia of Egypt, the sister of King Farouk I, married Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the then crown prince (later shah) of Iran.
The relationship between Iran and Egypt had fallen into open hostility after the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 which brought Gamal Abdel Nasser to power and the CIA-backed coup d'état in Iran in 1953 which saw the return of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to power. Due to the positive approach of the Shah towards Israel in July 1960 Egypt and Iran expelled each other's ambassadors. The strained relations between Egypt and Iran became progressively worse when Gamal Abdel Nasser financed Ayatollah Khomeini in May 1963 to accelerate the latter's opposition to the Shah.
Following Nasser's death in 1970, the presidency of Anwar Sadat turned this around quickly into an open and cordial friendship. Overnight, Egypt and Iran were turned from bitter enemies into fast friends. The relationship between Cairo and Tehran became so friendly that the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, called Sadat his "dear brother." After the 1973 war with Israel, Iran assumed a leading role in cleaning up and reactivating the blocked Suez Canal with heavy investment. Iran also facilitated the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Sinai Peninsula by promising to substitute with free Iranian oil the loss of the oil to the Israelis if they withdrew from the Egyptian oil wells in Western Sinai. All these added more to the personal friendship between Sadat and the Shah of Iran.
"Ties between the countries—among the largest and most influential in the Middle East—were turned hostile once again following the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979. Diplomatic relations between the two severed in 1980 following the admission of the deposed Shah of Iran to Egypt (where he died and was buried) and Egypt's recognition of Israel." Egypt's 1979 peace agreement with Israel also led to tense relations and Iran ceased direct flights to Egypt.
Egypt is the only Arab country without an embassy in Iran. Contentious issues include Egypt's signing of the Camp David Accords with Israel in 1979, its support for Iraq in Iran's eight-year conflict, the Islamic Republic's hailing of Khalid Islambouli, the President Anwar Sadat's assassin as a religious hero, seeing as there was both a street and mural named after him (however, the honouree was changed to Muhammad al-Durrah, the 12-year-old Palestinian boy shot and killed during the outset of the Second Intifada), and close Egyptian relations with the United States, and most of the Western European countries. In 2007, relations between the two countries thawed in the fields of diplomacy and economic trade, only to retreat during the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict when Iranian and Egyptian politicians exchanged blames over inaction towards the escalation of the conflict. It was not until the official resignation of President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011 that relations started to improve significantly. In April 2012, Iran appointed an ambassador to Egypt. Soon after Mohamed Morsi visited Iran in August 2012, it was decided to reestablish bilateral diplomatic relations, with rededication of embassy locations. A first ambassador was nominated to represent Egypt in Iran. While overall relations have been steadily improving, continued tensions between Iran, Saudi Arabia and allied Western nations have put this development into question. In March 2013, direct flights between two countries were reinstated. In July 2013, after the uprising and subsequent overthrow that removed Mohamed Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood-dominated government, the interim Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nabil Fahmy announced that Egypt seeks stable and positive ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran. In 2015, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi stated that Egypt has no relations with Iran on the Egyptian Extra News channel.
Bilateral visits
Following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, and the appointment of ambassadors after nearly 30 years, Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi made a historic first visit to Iran since the Iranian Revolution for the Non-Aligned Movement summit on 30 August 2012, where it handed over the rotating presidency to Iran. Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also visited Egypt in February 2013, making him the first Iranian president to travel to Egypt since the Iranian Revolution.

Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century is a 1980 book about the history of Christianity and homosexuality by the historian John Boswell.
Summary
The work is divided into four parts: “Points of Departure”, “The Christian Tradition”, “Shifting Fortunes” and “The Rise of Intolerance”. In his introduction, Boswell discusses Derrick Sherwin Bailey's Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition (1955), which he describes as a "pioneering study" upon which almost all "modern historical research on gay people in the Christian West" has depended. However, he writes that it, "suffers from an emphasis on negative sanctions which gives a wholly misleading picture of medieval practice, is limited primarily to data regarding France and Britain, and has been superseded even in its major focus, biblical analysis."
Publication history
Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality was published in 1980 by the University of Chicago Press. In 1981, the book appeared in paperback.
Reception
Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality won a National Book Award and the Stonewall Book Award in 1981.
The historians George Chauncey and Martin Duberman, writing with the women's studies scholar Martha Vicinus, described Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality as an "erudite study". They credited Boswell with providing "a revolutionary interpretation of the Western tradition", but noted that his premise that "a gay identity and gay people can be found throughout history" had been challenged as "essentialist" by social constructionists.
The political scientist Sheila Jeffreys argued that while Boswell covered material that "should provide fascinating insights into gender, power, and sexuality" he "avoids any such insights scrupulously." She criticized him for confusing "the abuse of slave children in prostitution" with "eroticism" and concluded that like other gay theorists he was guilty of "moral and political myopia."
The philologist Warren Johansson, the art historian Wayne R. Dynes and John Lauritsen criticized Boswell's thesis. They argued that Boswell had attempted to whitewash the historic crimes of the Christian Church against gay men.

Endel Aruja (5 July 1911 – 4 February 2008) was an Estonian physicist specialising in X-ray crystallography, encyclopedian, librarian, supporter of libraries and a long-term Estonian expatriate activist.
Short biography
Aruja was born in Soontaga, Valgamaa, and was initially schooled in his birthplace. For high school and later, university education, he moved to Tartu. After earning his M.Sc., he worked in 1938–1939 as a physics laboratory assistant in the Tallinn Technical University, then moved to England, where he received his PhD in 1943. In 1962, he moved to Canada.
Education
In 1935, Aruja graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Tartu.
In 1938, Aruja successfully defended his M.Sc. thesis.
In 1939, Aruja was granted a scholarship by the British Council and moved to Cambridge, England, where he received his PhD in physics from the Cambridge University in 1943.
Estonian expatriate activism
Aruja participated in founding and running of a number of Estonian organisations in England: the London Estonian Society, which he chaired for six years, the Estonian Association of England and the London Estonian House. He was the vice chairman of the organising committee of the 1984 ESTO, which was held in Toronto.
Aruja was an active participant of the Baltic Estonian Council, the Baltic Humanitarian Association, the Estonian National Fund () and the Estonian National Council, and he both edited and distributed periodical publications of these organisations. For this, he set up the publishing house Northern Publications. He's also written a number of Estonia-themed articles for the Encyclopædia Britannica, appearing among contributors of articles such as Estonia: Independence lost.
Most recently, Aruja was the first secretary of the Tartu Institute in Ontario, Canada from its founding in 1972 until 2004.
Book deliveries
Since 1986, Aruja had been organising supplies Estonian libraries with Estonian books published abroad. (The libraries had been unable such books during the Soviet occupation due to the Iron Curtain.) The first major shipment of 160 boxes, weighing about 5000 kg, arrived in 1989. Eventually, Aruja succeeded in delivering over 7000 boxes of books to various Estonian libraries, including all the major ones.
Collections
As an archivist and librarian, Aruja collected eight roomfuls, totalling about 236 square metres, worth of archival material, resulting in one of the most extensive cultural compendiums of Estonian expatriates.
Awards
In 1990, Endel Aruja was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Tartu; in 1998, the President of Estonia recognised his work by an Order of the White Star of class V, in 2002, he was awarded a medal of service by the Tartu University Library, and in 2003, the corporation Rotalia awarded him an honorary colour band.

Legislation on pornography in Italy states that it is illegal to distribute pictoral or video pornography to persons under the age of 18.
Legal status
The legal status of pornography itself is disputed in Italy. Technically, all production and distribution of pornography in the country is forbidden per Articles 528, 529, and 725 of the Italian Penal Code, which respectively sanction as felonies "Obscene publications and shows", "Obscene activities and objects", and "Commerce of publications, images or other objects offending public decency". In the 1980s, several courts in Italy enforced these laws, ordering confiscation of pornographic material in
their jurisdictions.
At present, however, the enforcement of such laws is virtually non-existent. A new, more permissive interpretation of the law was introduced in the late 1980s as courts ruled that the Penal Code should be seen as protecting citizens' rights to not be exposed to such materials if and when they don't wish to be. Thus, pornography was not to be considered illegal per se, unless someone were to expose such materials to another against the latter's own will. Notwithstanding these rulings, a small number of towns in Italy have enacted municipal regulations banning sex shops within their boundaries.
Providing or exposing pornography to minors under the age of 18 remains strictly forbidden. Other forbidden porn material includes child porn and Snuff porn; contrary to common belief, zoophilia is not illegal, nor is BDSM or fetishism, though other types of acts such as necrophilia are. Most of these extreme practices, though, take place in horror films, which are not covered by statute, rather than strictly pornographic fare.
Despite the recent trend toward legalization of porn, distribution of pornographic video materials is almost totally restricted to the home video market. Relevant laws #23 of 6 August 1990 and #203 of 30 May 1995 forbid the broadcast of hardcore pornography on free-to-air television channels, while such is legal on scrambled channels including digital terrestrial television and satellite television.
Access to these channels and networks, many of which are pay-per-view, requires a subscription and an IRD, which normally features a parental control function to restrict access to given channels. It remains legal to broadcast erotic/softcore movies, videos and infomercials on unencrypted TV channels from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.
By law, the seller is required to ask for proof of age if he suspects the buyer to be under the legal age for purchasing pornography. This restriction does not apply to certain softcore adult magazines (i.e. Playboy); nevertheless, an unspoken practice of not selling this kind of material to buyers under the age of 16 is observed by Italian news vendors.
Pornographic material depicting actors under the age of 18 is classified as child pornography, and is strictly forbidden. Minors cannot give legal consent to appear in pornographic productions of any kind, even though the age of consent in Italy varies from 14 to 16 years.

Navyug School, often referred to as a school for gifted children, is an experimental school for the talented children . It was founded in 1973 by New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) under the auspices of Navyug School Education Society.
The first of the 11 branches is in Sarojini Nagar, New Delhi. The first principal of the school was J. N. Dar, an Eton college alumnus. After the success of this school, NDMC opened 10 more branches in Delhi. All branches are run by Navyug School Education Society and funded by NDMC.
The selection of students is through a stringent written test followed by an interview. The students and the teachers go through a rigorous screening procedure, making these schools at par with any good private school in India. Its recent branch opened in Mandir Marg.
Navyug School at Sarojini Nagar has 1200 students on its roll, and the demand for admission is increasing each passing year. The students are provided with facilities like free meals, stationery and uniforms.
Navyug has a long list of successful former pupils, including:

Vivekanand Sharma, Physician MD, Internal Medicine, Biochemistry, https://www.southcoast.org/doctors/vivekanand-sharma-md/
Philosophy and objective
Rich or poor, education is a fundamental right of all. Educated masses are the foundation of a developed country. At the time of independence, there were few private schools but only rich could afford them. Government schools provided cheap education, but their standard was far below that of private schools.
Intelligence is not a function of wealth but it is required to mine and process the reserves of raw intelligence. Latent talent from economically weaker section generally goes waste in absence of resources. To harness this untapped potential, New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) formed Navyug School Education Society, which started the first Navyug School in 1973 at Sarojini Nagar, Delhi. The school is brain-child of Smt. Vidyaben Shah, who was then vice president of NDMC. The school is often quoted as a "school for gifted children".

Grimsby & District F.C. was an English association football club from the town of Grimsby in Lincolnshire.
History
The club was founded in 1882 and played at Mr Good's field on the Cleethorpes Road, at a time when the already existing Grimsby Town was playing at Clee Park. At the start of the 1883-84 season, the club took over the White Star club of Grimsby, which had been founded in 1878 and claimed to be the equal of Grimsby Town. The newly-merged club proved stronger with the addition of the leading White Star players, including J. Ellis and R. Fanthorpe, both of whom would be captains of the side, and the first match was against Hull side Blue Star in October 1883.
Soon afterwards, the club obtained its biggest win with a 13-0 victory over Louth Trinity Recreation in November 1883, with Raynes scoring 8. At the end of the season the club won its only trophy, the Hospital Cup, which the club returned to the Lincolnshire FA to be an annual prize between junior teams.
The club seems to have disbanded after the 1886-87 season, the last available reference to the club being its appearance in the first round of the Lincolnshire Senior Cup that season. As Grimsby Town were a professional club with enough stature to join the Football Combination for 1888-89, there was no scope for a second professional club in the town.
FA Cup
The club entered the FA Cup twice. In 1884-85 the club withdrew rather than having to travel to face Middlesbrough F.C., with Grimsby & District "being satisfied that they had no chance with the Tees-siders".
The next year the club lost 4-0 at Lincoln Lindum in the first round, before the largest crowd of the season at Lindum's home.
Colours
The club's colours were blue with a white silk sash.

Jack Hartman (October 7, 1925 – November 6, 1998) was an American gridiron football player and basketball coach.
Hartman played basketball and football collegiately at Oklahoma State University with his basketball tutelage under famed coach Henry Iba. After college, he played quarterback in the CFL before becoming a basketball coach. After leading the Coffeyville (Kansas) Junior College basketball team to the NJCAA National Championship with a 32–0 season in 1962, he took his high-octane offense to Southern Illinois University, replacing the successful Harry Gallatin, who had taken the head coaching job with the St. Louis Hawks. In 1967, passing up the NCAA Division II tournament after two successive second-place finishes, Hartman's Salukis won the NIT Championship, which was much more highly regarded then than it is today. He led Southern Illinois University into Division I before taking over at Kansas State when Cotton Fitzsimmons left to coach in the NBA.
Hartman spent 16 seasons as head coach at Kansas State University, where he won 294 games and finished in first or second place in the Big Eight Conference in 10 of those 16 seasons. After his retirement, he worked local television color commentary for Kansas State games, and his former player and assistant coach Lon Kruger took over as head coach at Kansas State.
Hartman is credited for introducing a unique two-tone uniform for Kansas State to wear during away games – lavender tops and purple shorts, which the Wildcats used from 1973–1982. During that stretch, KSU posted a record of 186–81 (.697), appeared in five NCAA Tournaments, and won the 1977 and 1980 Big Eight postseason tournaments. Lavender jerseys have since been associated with success at Kansas State, and the school has brought back lavender jerseys on certain occasions as a throwback uniform.
In 1996, when Kansas State fired its women's coach for NCAA violations, Hartman came out of retirement to coach the team for its last seven games, winning three.
Coach Hartman was inducted into the Southern Illinois University Hall of Fame in 1986, Kansas State University Hall of Fame in 1990, State of Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in 1990, and National Junior College Hall of Fame in 1991.
Hartman died in 1998. He has a street near Bramlage Coliseum named "Jack Hartman Drive" after him. His wife, Pat, lived in Manhattan, Kansas until her death in 2020. His daughter, Jackie, also lives in Manhattan and served as the Chief of Staff for the President of Kansas State University.

The 2022 Cardiff Council election took place on 5 May 2022 to elect 79 members to Cardiff Council. On the same day, elections were held to the other 21 local authorities and to community councils in Wales as part of the 2022 Welsh local elections. The previous Cardiff all-council election took place in May 2017 and future elections will take place every five years.
Background
Council elections in Wales were originally scheduled for May 2021, but were delayed to avoid a conflict with the 2021 Senedd election. The frequency of the elections was also increased from 4 years to five years to avoid future clashes, meaning (after 2022) the next council election is expected in 2027.
The number of councillors is to be increased from 75 to 79 at the 2022 election, with a number of ward changes to ensure better electoral parity.
The Labour group has been in control of the council since 2012.
The Welsh Cladiators, a residents group campaigning against fire defective buildings, hoped to stand in the Butetown ward.
A by-election was held in the Heath ward in November 2021—historically a ward split evenly between the main parties and seen as a possible indicator of the vote at the all-council election—which was won by the Labour Party with 47% of the vote. The Plaid joint candidate coming fourth with 7%.
Common Ground Alliance
In September 2021 Plaid Cymru and the Green Party announced an electoral pact, which would see them fielding a joint slate of candidates in Cardiff. Neither party had sitting councillors—Plaid Cymru's councillors elected in 2017 had been either expelled or had quit the party. In this election, the two parties fielded a common slate of candidates, known as the Common Ground Alliance. Of the 70 Common Ground Alliance candidates, 46 were from Plaid Cymru with the remaining 24 from the Green Party.
Ward changes
In October 2021 Cardiff Council accepted a number of ward change proposals made by the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales, with only slight modification. These were to take effect from the 2022 council election. The changes gave a better parity of representation. Twenty-one wards remained unchanged. Of the other wards:
Butetown would have an increase from 1 to 3 councillors.
Creigiau/St Fagans merges with the Pentyrch ward and is renamed "Pentyrch and St Fagans", with a total increase in councillors from 2 to 3.
Grangetown would get an increase from 3 to 4 councillors.
Lisvane renamed "Lisvane and Thornhill", with the addition of Thornhill from the neighbouring Llanishen ward and an increase from 1 to 3 councillors.
Llanishen sees a decrease in councillors, from 4 to 2, following the transfer of Thornhill to Lisvane.
Pentwyn sees a decrease in councillors, from 4 to 3.
Pontprennau/Old St Mellons renamed "Pontprennau and Old St Mellons".
Radyr would have an increase from 1 to 2 councillors.
Candidates by party
A total of 358 candidates were standing for the 79 seats on the council (an average of 4.5 candidates per seat). Eleven parties or alliances are standing candidates in this election, plus two independent candidates.
Both the Labour and the Conservatives are standing the full 79 candidates. Both the Common Ground Alliance and the Liberal Democrats are standing in all 28 wards, while Propel is standing in 21 wards (75%) and the Trade Union and Socialist Coalition has candidates in 15 wards (54%).

Paul Guillaume (1891 in Paris – 1934 in Paris) was a French art dealer. Dealer of Chaïm Soutine and Amedeo Modigliani, he was one of the first to organize African art exhibitions. He also bought and sold many works from cutting-edge artists of the time, such as Henri Matisse, Constantin Brâncuși, Pablo Picasso, and Giorgio de Chirico.
Life
Being from modest origins, Paul Guillaume worked first in a garage in Montmartre and then in his gallery in Paris. In his gallery he presented and sold especially the works of Amedeo Modigliani, who painted several portraits of him.
He found African sculptures which he displayed. This aroused the attention of Guillaume Apollinaire (whom he met in 1911), who in turn introduced him to many of the artists of the beginning of the century in France. He soon organized important exhibitions, such as the Première Exposition d'Art Nègre et d'Art Océanien, on 13–19 May 1919, with a catalogue by Henri Clouzot and additional text by Apollinaire. Apollinaire, who died the previous year, had also collaborated with Paul Guillaume on the pioneering study Sculptures Nègres in 1917. This exhibition – drawn from Guillaume's private collection – placed African art at the heart of Modernism.
After his death, his wife Domenica married architect Jean Walter and continued Guillaume's collection, selling his most "extreme" paintings and acquiring impressionist paintings. After her own death, this collection of 20th-century paintings became part of the Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris.
Domenica was once accused of the murder of Paul Guillaume, who died early and suspiciously. Some speculate that she was cleared of all charges in exchange for giving the collection to the French state after her death.

Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U.S. 402 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court case holding that New York City's program that sent public school teachers into parochial schools to provide remedial education to disadvantaged children pursuant to Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 necessitated an excessive entanglement of church and state and violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Aguilar v. Felton was subsequently overruled by Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203 (1997).

Gem County is a county in the U.S. state of Idaho. As of the 2010 census, the population was 16,719. The county seat and largest city is Emmett.
Gem County is part of the Boise, ID Metropolitan Statistical Area.
Gem County is home to the Idaho ground squirrel.
History
Named for the state nickname, "Gem State," the county was established on March 15, 1915, partitioned from Canyon County and Boise County. Fur trappers were in the area as early as 1818, and Alexander Ross explored Squaw Creek in 1824. Prospectors and miners moved through the county in 1862 en route to the gold rush in the Boise Basin around Idaho City, and by the next year irrigation began along the Payette River. Under Washington Territory, the area was part of Idaho County from the time of settlement until the territory south of the Payette River became part of Boise County at its creation in 1863. Picket's Corral, northeast of Emmett was the base of operations for a gang of horse thieves and "bogus dust peddlers" between 1862 and 1864. The Payette Vigilance Committee eliminated the gang, bringing safety for citizens of the area. The act creating Ada County in 1864 established the Ada County boundary common to Boise County as a line from Grimes Creek to Picket's Corral and then north from that point to the existing northern boundary of Boise County, leaving the areas outside of Emmett within Boise County. Jonathan Smith and Nathaniel Martin settled near Emmett about 1862. They established a ferry on the Payette River at Emmett in 1866. On May 31, 1867, a post office was established at the ferry and named Martinsville, which was renamed Emmettsville on October 31, 1868; postal officials shortened the name of the post office to Emmett in 1885.
Census data for the area shows Squaw Creek Precinct under Boise County with a population of 30 in 1870. Ada County did not separately return precincts at that census. By 1890, Squaw Creek was split into two precincts. Those precincts were grouped with Horseshoe Bend at the 1890 census. The Emmett precinct contained 479 residents at that time. The Emmett area was transferred to Canyon County at its establishment in 1892. At the 1910 Census, three Emmett area precincts contained a population of 2,601 while three Boise County precincts of Upper Squaw Creek, Lower Squaw Creek, and Pearl contained 1,069 residents.
The Black Canyon Diversion Dam on the river was built in the early 1920s, east of Emmett.
Based on a german television broadcast, there was even in the 1990s a high level of Radioactivity because of the Atomic Tests in Nevada.

In telecommunications, dirty paper coding (DPC) or Costa precoding is a technique for efficient transmission of digital data through a channel subjected to some interference known to the transmitter. The technique consists of precoding the data in order to cancel the interference. Dirty-paper coding achieves the channel capacity, without a power penalty and without requiring the receiver to know the interfering signal.
The term dirty paper coding was coined by Max Costa who compared the technique to writing a message on a piece of paper which is partially soiled with random ink strokes or spots. By erasing and adding ink in the proper places, the writer can convey just as much information as if the paper were clean, even though the reader does not know where the dirt was. In this analogy, the paper is the channel, the dirt is interference, the writer is the transmitter, and the reader is the receiver.
Note that DPC at the encoder is an information-theoretic dual of Wyner-Ziv coding at the decoder.
Variants
Instances of dirty paper coding include Costa precoding (1983). Suboptimal approximations of dirty paper coding include Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) published in 1971 and the vector perturbation technique of Hochwald et al. (2005).
Design considerations
DPC and DPC-like techniques require knowledge of the interference state in a non causal manner, such as channel state information of all users and other user data. Hence, the design of a DPC-based system should include a procedure to feed side information to the transmitters.
Applications
In 2003, Caire and Shamai applied DPC to the multi-antenna multi-user downlink, which is referred to as the 'broadcast channel' by information theorists. Since then, there has been widespread use of DPC in wireless networks and into an interference aware coding technique for dynamic wireless networks.
Recently, DPC has also been used for "informed digital watermarking" and is the modulation mechanism used by 10GBASE-T.

Paul Giudicelli Palmieri (1921–1965) was an abstract painter from the Dominican Republic.
Early life and education
He was born at the Ingenio Porvenir, in San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic to Corsican immigrants. Giudicelli spent a few years of his early childhood in Europe, but returned to the Dominican Republic in the 1930s, living in Santo Domingo. In 1937, being aged just 16, Giudicelli married with a girl surnamed Vidal; they had 2 boys: Paul Giudicelli and Ángel Giudicelli.
Although he showed a talent and enthusiasm for art in his youth, it was not until 1948, at the age of 28, that he began formal training at the National School of Fine Arts. He graduated from the school in 1951. In a second marriage he begat a girl: Frida.
Career
Soon after graduating, Giudicelli participated in the São Paulo Biennial and the National Biennial (Dominican Republic) in 1952. He held his first solo exhibition in 1953 at the National Gallery of Fine Arts, showing 70 works. Art critic Horia Tanasecu gave the exhibition a very favorable review, stating that the artist had "extraordinary talent" and brought "new energy to the national art scene". Tanasecu also noted the incredible variety of stylistic influences in the artist's work, including Cubism, Abstraction, Impressionism, Symbolism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Fauvism, Naturalism and Academicism.
Giudicelli participated in group exhibitions in Barcelona (1956) and Switzerland (1957), as well as other National Biennials in the Dominican Republic. His second solo exhibition was held in 1957, and his third in 1959. The artist also began painting murals in 1959, receiving commissions for various public buildings.
In 1959, Giudicelli was offered a grant to study mural painting in France, but was denied a passport from the Trujillo dictator government. Giudicelli's son Pablo, an embassy employee in Costa Rica, had refused to follow an order from the dictator, creating negative effects for the entire family. As a result of the political scandal, in 1960 Giudicelli also lost the positions he had recently obtained as both professor and vice director of the National School of Fine Arts, but was reinstated in 1961 after the dictator's death.
Death
Giudicelli continued his successful painting career until he died of cancer, aged 43–44, in East Santo Domingo.

"Sois moi - Be Me" is a 2011 song of French-Canadian singer and songwriter Mylène Farmer, with music by Laurent Boutonnat. It was published on her second best-of 2001.2011, issued on 5 December 2011. Alongside "Du temps", "Sois moi – Be Me" was one of the two then unreleased songs from the album. The song poorly charted in France, peaking at number 57, and generally received negative reviews from both critics and Farmer's fans.
Release, lyrics and music
On 30 November 2011, six days before the compilation album's release, the song leaked on one of the singer's fan site.
"Sois moi – Be Me" is an uptempo electropop song, with two verses dealing with the themes of madness, sexuality and melancholy, and a chorus only composed of the words 'Be me oh-oh!'. Before the second verse, Farmer can be heard moaning in a sexual manner.
Reception
Many reviews were unfavourable and noted the similarity of "Sois moi – Be Me" with Britney Spears' 2008 song "Gimme More". According to evous.fr site, "this pop-dance-oriented song seems to annoy many fans. Their comments published on YouTube suggest a certain disappointment". A poll on the Mylene.net site, in order to know the opinion of Farmer's fans about the song, indicated that 22.8% of the voters answered "I hate", which was the highest percentage out of the five answers.
News de Stars said: "From the first notes, we are surprised by the tone of this new resolutely electro, very rhythmic and very fast track. (...) "Really, we seem to have heard [the chorus] somewhere... And indeed, the "be me" played repeatedly by Mylène Farmer give the feeling to hear... "Gimme More" by Britney Spears!” French magazine Têtu considered the song very different from "Du temps" and that it "immediately recalls Britney Spears' sexual hit "Gimme More"". To journalist Benoît Cachin, the music of the song is " swinging" and the lyrics are "poor". Although he considers that there is nothing special in this song, he believes that it is "first designed for dance floors, where lyrics do not matter".
On his blog, French author and journalist Hugues Royer, who wrote a book on Farmer in 2008, stated: "I think this is the first time I do not really adhere to a song of Mylène (...). I did not detect either the usual fluidity of Boutonnat's melodies or that singular thing in the lyrics that makes Mylène a special artist". However, he thought that the song could be effective on radio.
Much more critical, the writing committee of Pop Heart said to be "hilarious" after listening to the song, adding: "Our champion of the day has managed the feat to propose a track that Ysa Ferrer herself would not dare record. Everything looks like a parody: cheap music, lyrics that are not renewed". The song was deemed a "auditory attack". When Farmer's next studio album Monkey Me was released in December 2012, Julien Dejardin of ptitblog.net considered the song "Love Dance" as being worse than "Sois moi – Be Me".
Although it has not been released as a single, "Sois moi – Be Me" charted in France due to downloads on the week of the album's release. It debuted at a peak of number 57 on the chart edition of 10 December 2011.

The Frank J. Hecox House, also known as the House of the Seven Gables, is a single-family home located at 3720 West Grand River Avenue near Howell, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. It is a rare example of Second Empire architecture in the region.
History
Very little is known of Frank J. Hecox and his wife Ada save that they were farmers. In 1886, the couple bought the 76-acre farm that this house is located on. It is likely that the farm at the time had a house located at the site of the present house. In 1887, Hecox constructed this new house. It is also unknown how long the Hecoxes live on the farm, although it is likely they remained until the latter part of the 1890s. Certainly by 1900 the farm was being rented, and in 1907 Ada Hecox, then living in San Jose, California, sold the farm. The farm remained a rental property until 1922, when it was purchased by Fred A. and Cora A. Smith. Fred and Cora Smith died in the 1950s, and the farm was passed to their family, eventually being sold in the early 1970s.
The house was once again turned into a rental property, and was used by the Camelot Exploration Company, an oil company, as offices. In 1982 it was purchased and restored by a private owner.
Description
The Frank J. Hecox House is a two-story brick Second Empire house on a raised basement. It has a metal-clad mansard roof with seven gables, one in the front and three on each side. The front elevation has paired arched Italianate windows below the steeply pitched gable. The double-door entry is sheltered by a wooden porch. Another porch is on the side. Windows are one-over-one double sash units with Italianate segmental arch tops and simple surrounds. An enclosed porch addition is at the rear.
On the interior, the first floor contains a front entrance hall, parlor, a large reception room, two bedrooms, a dining room, and the original kitchen with built-in cupboards. A cast iron corner fireplace is located in the parlor. A large open front stair and smaller enclosed rear stair lead to the upper floor. The upper floor contains two rear bedrooms, two front bedrooms, and a bath. A full brick basement is partitioned into several rooms.

Rakel Dink (born 1959) is a Turkish Armenian human rights activist and head of the Hrant Dink Foundation.
She is the last member of the Armenian Varto Tribe who had settled in Cizre. She is the widow of Hrant Dink, a Turkish journalist and human rights activist of Armenian origin who was assassinated on 19 January 2007.
She grew up in the Armenian orphanage, Kamp Armen, in Tuzla and served as the camp's manager for many years. She later became known for her speech at her husband's funeral. Her famous quote – "Nothing can be done without questioning the darkness that creates a killer from a baby." – was well-received by the public and published in the media. Following Hrant Dink's assassination, she became involved in human rights activities and has served as the head of Hrant Dink Foundation since 2007.
Life
She was born in 1959 in Silopi. She is the second child of Varto tribe's chief Siyament Yağbasan (Vartanyan) and his wife Delal.
The Armenian Varto tribe received an order for exile in 1915, but when they were attacked during the voyage, they took refuge in Mount Judi with the help of an Arabic Muslim tribe called "Tayanlar" and lived there for 25 years. After 25 years and following World War II, the tribe moved to Cizre and was assimilated by Turkey to the Kurdish population there and began to speak mostly in Kurdish, and to carry out Christian worship in Kurdish. After living a migrant life in bristle tents for a while, the tribe settled in the village of Varto, today called Yolağzı. Members of the tribe moved to Istanbul in 1978 and later to Belgium and France in the 1980s, and Dink's father Siyament died in Brussels in 2004. Rakel Dink is the last member of the tribe in Turkey.
Growing up in the village of Varto, Rakel Dink lost her mother in 1967, when she was 8 years old. Her father was taken to Istanbul with 12 children during his visit to the Armenian Protestant preacher Hrant Guzelyan (also known as Kucukguzelyan), a program for the placement of Anatolian Armenians in Istanbul. Rakel Dink was in the second group sent to Istanbul. In 1968, she went to Istanbul with her two brothers, and was placed in the Armenian Orphanage in Tuzla, called Kamp Armen. In summers, she stayed in Tuzla and in winters she was moved to Gedikpaşa Orphanage. Rakel Dink, who did not speak any languages other than Kurdish at the time, learned Turkish and Armenian in Istanbul. She graduated from Gedikpaşa İncirdibi Armenian Elementary School. Since she was officially registered as a Turkish citizen, it was not possible for her to attend the Armenian school anymore. When her father did not allow her to attend a Turkish school after fifth grade, she was left out of the formal education system. She received a special education at the Gedikpaşa Orphanage.
She later met Hrant Dink at the Tuzla Armenian Children's Camp and married him on 19 April 1976. The religious ceremony was conducted at a church on 23 April 1977. The couple had three children: Delal (1978), Arat (1979) and Sera (1986).
After the arrest of Güzelyan, the director of the Tuzla camp, in 1979 Rakel Dink, together with her husband, served as the director of the Tuzla Armenian Children's Camp.
Her husband, Hrant Dink, was assassinated on 19 January 2007 as he returned to the offices of Agos. A funeral was organized for Hrant Dink on 23 January 2007, which was attended by a large number of people. Rakel Dink also delivered a speech at the ceremony.
Rakel Dink is the president of the Hrant Dink Foundation, which was established in 2007 in order to develop a culture of dialogue, peace and empathy in order to keep Hrant Dink's dreams, language and heart alive for a more fair and free world.

The Caraquet and Gulf Shore Railway was in brief existence on the Chaleur Bay's south shore, between Bathurst and Tracadie with a spur line to Shippagan. Its heyday was during the early part of the Twentieth century.
History
In the early 1870s, the forest on the shores of Chaleur Bay were seen to be receding. A group of Bathurst townspeople involved in the lumber trade imagined that the area around Tracadie could serve to feed their industry if only a suitable form of transport could be arranged. Thus was born the Caraquet Railway Company on 18 April 1874. The first contracts were not let until a decade later.
On 7 August 1884, the sod-turning for the Caraquet Railway occurred, with luminaries like Kennedy Francis Burns in attendance. On 30 June 1885 the first section from Bathurst to Stonehaven was completed. Two years later approximately 30 km of rail had been laid. It was completed by 1890, but not before controversy exploded into public view. In 1889 there was a major scandal when the shareholders accused Burns of fraudulent schemes and false representation in regard to the construction and the issuing of shares. He was exposed in Parliament by Edward Blake. Throughout his career as a businessman, Burns mainly used Acadian workers, paid with due-bills, which could be exchanged only at the company store. He was supported in this artifice by catholic Bishop James Rogers. Burns was the beneficiary of governmental largesse in the form of railroad subsidies and cutting licences for timber on New Brunswick crown lands.
In 1908 were listed 23 stops, such as Stonehaven, Grande-Anse, Burnsville and Caraquet along the line from Bathurst to Shippagan.
On 13 April 1911, the Caraquet Railway Company merged with the Gulf Shore Company, which had opened for business in July 1897 and connected Pokemouche Junction with Sheila. With the merger came a new name, and the Caraquet and Gulf Shore Railway was born.
In May 1918, the Dominion government offered $200,000 to purchase the railway, but the owners were somewhat reluctant because the capital invested to date was on the order of ten times that sum. But the C&GS had been built by government programmes, so the Minister of Public Works could be firm:
The C&GS was absorbed by the newly-minted Canada Northern Crown corporation on 1 June 1920 for the original offer.
A brakeman who joined the company in 1919 remembered the C&GS as a slow-moving mixed train of people, livestock and freight that stopped anywhere and everywhere.
McCarthy (1997) relates a tale of how, during the great blizzard of 1935, men were employed at a rate of $2 a day to clear a path in the snow down to the rails.
A map dated 1987 shows the CN rail line still in existence.

Willie & Phil is a 1980 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Paul Mazursky and starring Michael Ontkean, Margot Kidder, and Ray Sharkey.
Plot
The film is set in late 1970s New York City, amidst the counterculture chic of that era. Willie, a high school English teacher who plays jazz piano, and Phil, a fashion photographer, meet coming out of the Bleecker Street Cinema, where Jules et Jim has just been shown, and become friends. They both fall in love with Jeannette, a girl from Kentucky.

Critical responses
The film was reviewed by Pauline Kael in The New Yorker. "It could be that the theme of Jules et Jim, which preoccupies Mazursky - woman as the source of life and art, and woman as destroyer - is just what he can't handle. The ad for Willie & Phil does bring out the film's latent subject: we see the open mouth of a giant goddess who is holding two men in the palm of her hand. They reach up to her with their offerings - one with a bottle of wine, the other with a bunch of flowers. She may be breathing life into these dwarf suitors or preparing to devour them along with their gifts. Either way, she's a source of awe and terror. All through the picture, Mazursky has been trying to demystify what he experiences as mystifying. This movie is a little monument to screwed-up notions of what women are."

Ashur-Dan II (Aššur-dān) (934–912 BC), son of Tiglath Pileser II, was the earliest king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. He was best known for recapturing previously held Assyrian territory and restoring Assyria to its natural borders, from Tur Abdin (southeast Turkey) to the foothills beyond Arbel (Iraq). The reclaimed territory through his conquest was fortified with horses, ploughs, and grain stores. His military and economic expansions benefited four subsequent generations of kings that replicated his model.
Background
The direction of the campaigns conducted by Assyrian kings and the means of reconstructing chronology of events from the period of 841–745 and beyond are found in one type of eponym list, commonly known as an Eponym Chronicle. The Assyrian royal annals add to this skeleton outline significantly. Annals are still preserved for all but the last few kings. There are no letters available from this period, however administrative and legal documents exist. For Ashur-Dan II, whose annals are only preserved in fragments, certain characteristics of Assyrian military can be observed. He followed the description of his military exploits by the count of wild animals (wild bulls, elephants, and lions) that he had hunted and killed, which traditionally characterized Assyrian kings as protective and heroic. The accounts conclude with Ashur-Dan's building activities, stressing that he did not exploit the spoils of his campaign to enrich himself, but rather to honour and exalt the gods.
Accomplishments
The fragmentary annals suggest Ashur-Dan was the first king to conduct regular military campaigns in over a century. His military campaigns primarily focused on northern territories along mountainous terrain that made controlling it problematic. These areas were vital because they lay close to the Assyrian heartland and thus were vulnerable to enemy attacks. Furthermore, several important routes leading to Anatolia ran through these areas and were a source of crucial metals. In one of his more significant victories, Ashur-Dan captured the king of the northeastern state of Kadmuhu, flayed him, and displayed his skin publicly on the walls of Arbela, then replaced him with a loyal subordinate and took valuable bronze, tin, and precious stones from Kadmuhu.
Another chief concern of Ashur-Dan's known military campaigns was the Aramaeans to the west. The fragmentary annals state that Ashur-Dan believed he was rightfully retaking Assyrian territory occupied by the Aramaeans in the recent past. He also claimed that he had brought back Assyrians who had fled due to starvation to resettle the lands. The impression conveyed through these annals was that the Aramaeans had enslaved and slaughtered Assyrians and seized their land.
Eastwards, the Zagros foothills down to the lower Zab, were crucial strategic points where Assyrian kings frequently campaigned, both for Assyrian security and to safeguard the limited routes through the mountains. This was a key commercial point for Assyrians, through which they received horses and valuable lapis lazuli mined in northeast Afghanistan.
After re-establishing Assyria's borders, Ashur-Dan went through an extensive period of resettlement and land reclamation. Ashur-Dan also left his mark on the Craftsman's Gate and the New Palace by performing construction on both sites. His basic ideology and strategy laid the foundation for the Neo-Assyrian period, which was elaborated by his successors. He was able to establish a uniformly structured political entity with well-defined and well-structured borders. His conquest is presented as a return of stability and prosperity after a perceived unlawful period of intrusion. The displaced Assyrians were rehoused in towns and the resettled lands were fortified with agricultural growth. The decline of Early Assyria was largely due to a lack of systematic administration and an influx of Arameans. Ashur-Dan established government offices in all provinces, creating a strong administrative presence in the areas under his rule. At the end of the millennium, Assyria was surrounded by enemies to the south, in and around Babylonia, to the west by the Arameans in Syria, and to the north and east by the Nairi people. Ashur-Dan successfully expanded Assyrian territory surrounded by formidable foes and established provincial administration that once again transformed Assyria from a territorial power to an imperial power known as the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The Neo-Assyrian Empire was a diverse and multi-ethnic state from people from many tribes of different origins. It was a uniformly structured political entity with well-defined and well-guarded borders, and the Assyrian kings certainly regarded it as a unified whole, "the land of Aššur", whose territory they constantly strove to expand. To the outside world, it likewise was a unified, monolithic whole, whose inhabitants were unhesitatingly identified as Assyrians regardless of their ethnic backgrounds.
Succession
Ashur-Dan was succeeded by his son, Adad-nirari II (911–891 BC). He continued to campaign repeatedly in areas that his father had attacked, expanding on his father's achievements. He ruled two years less than his father, but the number and range of his military campaigns were greater. To the west he marched as far as the Balikh river, to the south as far as the middle Euphrates, to the north as far as the southern regions of Lake Van, and to the east he penetrated the Zagros mountains. Three versions of his annals are known. Altogether the annals cover campaigns from the accession to the eighteenth regnal year.

Hadjé Halimé Oumar (1930-2001) was a Chadian activist, educator, and politician.
Biography
Halimé was born in the town of Salamat in 1930 to a mother from Salamat and a father from Abeche. She became involved with the Parti Progressiste Tchadien (PPT) in 1950 while working as a Quranic instructor. She was able to bring in more women who did not know French due to her knowledge of Chadian Arabic. At the time she had only a limited grasp of French. She was particularly close to Gabriel Lisette, the founder of the party, and his wife, Lisette Yéyon. She became responsible for recruiting Northern women following the General Meeting of 2 April 1950. Halimé harshly criticized the colonial administration's poll tax, and declared that if the PPT secured a victory, the poll tax would be abolished for all despite the platform calling for ending the tax only on women. She explained that "women were arrested on their arrival on the market or anywhere. They were left in the sun until they paid the tax which was 370 riyals per person." She declared that Lisette was the undisputed leader of the party, despite the rise of Southern Chadian politician François Tombalbaye, and traveled to France on Lisette's urging to meet with the French politician Rene Coty.
However, in 1959 and 1960 Tombalbaye gained power and Lisette was removed from power. Halimé became the target of repression soon after independence, unlike her PPT female colleague Kalthouma Nguembang. As part of a purge of those near to Lisette, Halimé's only son was murdered, and she was arrested in September 1963. At first, she was taken to Massenya in Chari-Baguirmi Region, then to a central prison in Chad's capital of N'Djamena, and finally to a dreaded prison at Kela. At the Kela prison, she was regularly tortured by guards through electrocution while French and Israeli army officers supervised. Her torture resulted in her losing all her fingernails and hair. Despite Tombalbaye wanting Halimé to be killed, a French officer spared her life. In an interview, she stated that only her faith was able to keep her going through the difficult circumstances of torture. She was finally released on 28 April 1975, days after the overthrow of Tombalbaye and his regime. Out of 600 people who were imprisoned during this purge, she was one of only 45 who lived.
Lisette, who had been exiled in France, helped bring her to Paris to receive medical treatment. Halimé spent time in a hospital in Cote d'Ivoire, where the president Felix Houphouet-Boigny mandated that her medical care was free. She later joined the National Liberation Front of Chad or FROLINAT, which was based in Libya. In 1978, she moved to Tripoli and returned to politics. FROLINAT members dubbed her "the mother of the revolution", and the party seized power in 1979. She also began educating girls in Libya and founded an Islamic school, the Rising New Generation, where she taught religion, home economics, and child care. She taught over 3600 girls at the school during her years there.
She returned to N'Djamena in 1980 with the Popular Armed Forces (FAP) leader Goukouni Oueddei. She was then the president of the women's faction of FROLINAT. After the election of Hissène Habré in 1982, she left with forces loyal to Oueddeï in Libya. While in Libya, Halimé taught military skills to exile Chadian women. She returned to Chad in 1991, a year after the overthrow of Habré by Idriss Déby. Many people told Deby they would support him only if he received the backing of Halimé, which she eventually did. Shortly after her return, she won a seat in Chad's parliament and served there until 1996.
In 1993, she participated in the National Sovereign Conference (CNS), and was one of the most fervent defenders of the Arabic language. In 1994, she created an association called Women Az-Zara. On behalf of the association, she was voted among ten women candidates to be a member of the Higher Council of Transition, staying four years. In June 1996, she ran for parliament as a member of the opposition National Front of Chad party, as it was impossible to run as an independent. She was defeated but maintained the election was rigged. Halimé afterwards cared for orphans whose parents were killed in the Habré regime. She also opened an Arabic school in N'Djamena.
She went on six pilgrimages to Mecca in her life, including one last trip in 2000. She died on 7 January 2001, and is fondly remembered as a women's resistance figure in Chad today. Summing up her legacy, she stated, "I fought for the people as I struggled against the colonizer."

Michael Geier (born March 12, 1964), known as Big Mike Geier, is a singer, entertainer, and leader of the band Kingsized, which is based in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. Geier's most critically acclaimed act is his alter ego: a Pagliacci-type clown named Puddles Pity Party. As Puddles, Geier has appeared in YouTube videos since 2013, including some with Scott Bradlee's Postmodern Jukebox. Geier now performs almost exclusively as Puddles, but he also refers to Puddles as a completely separate entity from himself. Likewise, "Puddles" also won't acknowledge himself as Geier.
Biography
Geier was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, the fifth of seven children of "Big Oz" and Peg Geier. He says that he "grew up in a houseful of giants", with his two brothers and four sisters all growing to at least in height. Geier is tall. He grew up in Richmond, Virginia. Living in, and based in Atlanta, Georgia since 1995, Geier is married to his business partner, Shannon Newton.
In the early 1990s, Geier led a touring "Swing Noir" band, The Useless Playboys, before settling in Atlanta in 1995. Around this time, Geier started up an Elvis tribute band, Kingsized. Several years into Kingsized, Geier began experimenting with a clown-themed side project called Greasepaint, which laid the foundation for his later alter ego, Puddles.
Puddles Pity Party
Originally, Puddles was a Shriner clown, but eventually developed into Puddles Pity Party, wearing a whiteface clown costume. Geier considers himself and Puddles to be separate people, and he refuses to break character. Like Geier himself, Puddles has a baritone singing voice, and sings mostly covers of songs. Puddle has a depressed persona and refrains from speaking on stage or giving interviews. His shows include a mix of silent prop comedy, mime, and audience participation with songs interplayed throughout creating a narrative structure. Puddles Pity Party performed in Aqua Teen Hunger Force's 2010 tour.
In 2011, Geier appeared regularly at the Manderley Bar in New York's immersive theater show Sleep No More. In 2012, he moved to Seattle to appear in a European-style vaudevillian cabaret, Teatro ZinZanni. In 2013, he opened for Eels during their U.S. and European tour.
In October 2013, Geier recorded a cover of Lorde's "Royals" with Postmodern Jukebox on YouTube. , the video has been viewed over 29.4 million times. Lorde declared his cover to be her favorite cover of "Royals". Two more versions of Royals, in a "punk" style and in a "new-wave" style appeared in the later part of 2020. Puddle has collaborated with Bradlee on YouTube several times since.
Since 2014, Geier has toured the world, playing concerts in the United States, United Kingdom, Belgium, and Australia.
On September 27, 2014, his live performance of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah", at the Regency Ballroom in San Francisco, was filmed by director Gary Yost and was later described by HuffPost as "A Strange Kind Of Beautiful". the video on YouTube had received over 8.7 million views.
In 2017, Geier, as Puddles, participated in season 12 of the reality series America's Got Talent. He advanced to the quarterfinals at the Dolby Theatre, where he performed his version of "Royals" and received an "X" from Simon Cowell. He was ultimately eliminated the following night. In October 2017 Geier, as Puddles, made an appearance in a Cartoon Network ad promoting new episodes of Teen Titans Go! and OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes. Geier previously collaborated with Cartoon Network's Sunday Pants series writing music for the show as well as playing the Slacks' band leader in the live action segments.
In January 2019 Geier, as Puddles, began a headline act residency at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, Nevada.
In 2022, Geier, as Puddles, made a guest appearance on the season 4 season finale of The Conners.

The Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) is a 20 item interview-based clinical assessment that evaluates cognitive deficits and the degree to which these deficits impair patients' day-to-day functioning. It was originally developed in 2001 at the Duke University Medical Center by Dr. Richard Keefe and is licensed through VeraSci. The SCoRS is used in clinical trials, academic research, and in clinical settings.
Description
The SCoRS assessment collects information generated from three different sources: (1) An interview with the patient, (2) an interview with an informant for the patient (ideally a person who has regular contact with the patient in everyday situations, such as a family member, friend, or social worker), and (3) a rating based on the clinical judgement of the clinician who administered the scale to the patient and informant. In addition to the 20 individual items, there is also a global rating assigned by the clinician after both interviews have been completed that draws upon information gained from the patient, informant, and the interviewer's clinical judgement.
Each interview averages 10–15 minutes in length with the patient interview preferably completed prior to the informant interview. Total assessment time for the SCoRS, including scoring, averages 20–30 minutes. The SCoRS requires no additional equipment beyond the paper administration form and is ideally administered in a quiet environment free from distractions. The informant interview can also be administered over the phone if the informant is unable to be physically present at the clinician's office.
Administration
The SCoRS is a 20 item interview-based clinical assessment containing questions about the patient's ability to manage cognitively demanding, functionally relevant, everyday tasks such as conversations, watching television, and using electronic devices. The items were developed to assess the following cognitive domains:
Attention
Memory
Working Memory
Language Production
Reasoning
Problem-Solving
Motor Skills
Social Cognition
These areas were chosen because they are often severely impaired in patients with schizophrenia and they are reliably associated with functional outcomes. Two examples of items from the SCoRS are, “Do you have difficulty with remembering names of people you know?” and “Do you have difficulty following a TV show?”. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from “No Impairment” to “Severe Impairment”. A rating of “Not Applicable” is also possible if a particular question does not apply to an individual patient.
In addition to the 20 individual items, there is also a global rating assigned by the clinician after the patient and informant interviews have been completed. For the patient and informant interviews, the global rating reflects the overall impression of the patient's level of cognitive difficulty across the 20 areas of cognition assessed and is rated on a scale of 1–10. Higher ratings indicate greater degrees of impairment.
Use and Supporting Research
The SCoRS is currently being used as a co-primary endpoint in several international phase 2 and phase 3 trials assessing cognitive treatment change in schizophrenia, and has been permitted by the FDA for pivotal registration trials. As an interview-based assessment of cognition, the SCoRS meets the criteria established by the FDA NIMH MATRICS panel for co-primary outcome measures for cognitive enhancement trials in schizophrenia.
In addition, the cognitive domains assessed by the SCoRS also correspond with the 7 cognitive domains identified by experts from an initiative established by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) project which strengthens the SCoRS' attractiveness as a co-primary measure for Schizophrenia cognition trials.
Data from recent research also suggest that the SCoRS has potential as a clinically relevant measure in a clinical practice setting due to its sensitivity to treatment effects.

Southwestern Tasmanian, or Toogee, is a possible aboriginal language of Tasmania. It is the most poorly attested known variety of Tasmanian, and it is not clear how distinct it was. It was apparently spoken along the west coast of the island, south of Macquarie Harbour.
Southwestern Tasmanian is attested from a single word list, collected in Port Davey by George Augustus Robinson from the Ninenee Tribe of the Bathurst Harbour area. There are 131 words, but some of these may be from Southeastern Tasmanian languages. The data are consistent with a Western Tasmanian language, but were not clean enough to allow classification by Bowern (2012); Dixon & Crowley (1981) had likewise left it alone.
History
The Toogee were Tasmanian aborigines that lived in Western Tasmania, Australia, before European settlement. Their area of inhabitation included Macquarie Harbour. This tribe consisted of two different bands, the Lowreenne and Ninegin. They made stone tools, including those from Darwin Glass - a natural glass formed from a meteorite impact. The archeological record for this region goes back to 20,000 years, with relics found in the Kuti Kina Cave. The Toogee also left behind middens of shells along the coast.

In Pacific Film Laboratories v Commissioner of Tax, (Australia) Windeyer J defined copyright: "It is not a right in an existing thing. It is a negative right, as it has been called, a power to prevent the making of a physical thing by copying."
Case Details
The Pacific Film Laboratories v. Commissioner of Tax was regarding whether the reproduction of prints owned by a third party, for that third party was an act of sale which could incur sales tax. Pacific Film argued that as it had no property right in the prints, it was not selling anything to the customer which might be taxed. The High Court rejected this argument saying that when Pacific Film reproduced the customer's negatives, under authorisation from the customer, the copyright was owned by the customer but the chattel produced in the process of reproduction was owned by Pacific Film. The sale of this
chattel to the customer incurred the sales tax.

Dheinsville is an important historical settlement (modern-day neighborhood) in the village of Germantown, Wisconsin, Washington County, United States. Dheinsville is located at the intersection of Highway 167 (Holy Hill Road), State Highway 145, and Maple Road.
History
Dheinsville was established in 1842 by the Philip Dhein family. The neighborhood contains original half-timber buildings (fachwerk), reflecting the building construction patterns of the early pioneers from the Hunsrück area of Germany. The Bast Bell Museum consists of log, quarried limestone, brick, and clapboard buildings dating from early settlement through the Victorian period. It was named for Philip Dhein who emigrated from Germany in 1842. The post office was established in July 1855 with Adam Staats as the first postmaster.

The Foreign Press Association in Berlin delivered a message to Joseph Goebbels, asking him to "take the necessary steps in our mutual interests to protect foreign journalists henceforth against slanders and chicane, as we are convinced these happenings are unknown to you." The letter went on to state, "For some time there has been evidence of systematic action against foreign journalists residing here. Foreign journalists of distinction, both women and men, who for years within the limits of their own national possibilities reported on Germany with good will, hear their profession attacked at gatherings to which they have been invited. Moreover, the residences of members were recently searched disgracefully by members of the GSP. The fruitlessness of the searches does not alter the fact that the victims were disillusioned, if not embittered."

Acoustiguide is a provider of interactive museum guides for museums, art galleries, heritage sites, and other public displays. In 2005 it merged with the Israeli company Espro Information Technologies.
History
Acoustiguide launched an early mobile interpretation guide in 1957, with a tour of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Hyde Park narrated by his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt. Audioguides in museums had been available in the United States since 1954, with the Guide-A-Phone system at the American Museum of Natural History. Available on then-new portable reel-to-reel players, the tour led visitors through the estate's public and private spaces, and told stories of day-to-day life and special visits by dignitaries.
In 1959, the Phoenix Art Museum was the first museum to use an Acoustiguide to interpret their permanent collection, which was narrated by Vincent Price. Cassette players were used though the 1960s and infrared and radio frequency tour systems were used in the 1970s with a specific cassette model, called the M1 player. Concurrently, AM and FM wands were introduced at Centrepoint Tower in Sydney, Queen's House (National Maritime Museum), and the Mary Rose Trust.
Acoustiguide gained popularity in museum education with "blockbuster" exhibitions in the 1980s. P2s or Panasonic XBS cassette players were bought off-the-shelf and the company built a mass charging system with custom made charging racks, in order to satisfy the increasing needs by museums.
With this increase in demand, the company opened offices in Europe and Asia, which included one of the first American-based companies to be opened in Mainland China (at Beijing's Forbidden City). In 1993, Acoustiguide created digital wands with "random access tours" which allowed visitors to choose the objects they wanted to learn more about and to go at their own pace in a sequence of their own choosing. These players debuted at the Louvre, in Paris.
Current technology
Acoustiguide offers digital audio and multimedia interpretative tours via a variety of platforms including smartphones, multimedia MP3 players, radio transmission systems and the internet, as well as proprietary hardware and software guiding solutions designed and manufactured specifically for the cultural and tourism markets. Acoustiguide also offers Acoustiguide Mobile, a multimedia app for iOS and Android smartphones and tablets. Acoustiguide's products are solid state and include keypads to allow visitors to choose content appropriate to their location in the exhibit, as well as additional material such as multimedia and video vignettes. Acoustiguide technology is in use at hundreds of sites worldwide
Inform
The first digital wand player which allowed for 'random access' tours. Still used in some institutions throughout the United States.
Denon
In 1996, Acoustiguide and Denon co-created the second generation of digital players. These are used infrequently.
AG 2000
The third generation of digital random access audio equipment was launched in 2000. It came with the ability to use it as a wand or with headphones, increased memory capacity, MP3 sound, customized data collection, LCD screens, features for individuals with disabilities and the ability to update via the internet. This model is no longer available for new purchases, but can be found in a few locations throughout the United States.
exSite
Four models of exSite have been launched since 2000. Each exSite unit is wand-based and capable of collecting data about the use of the tour via a survey. exSite units are still sold by Acoustiguide.
Opus
Launched at the Museums and Heritage Show in 2007, it comes in two models: Click (with keypad) and Touch (with touch screen). Both have color screens and provide audio content, images, video, photos, animation and maps. Both can be used as a wand or a headset player. This is the most popular unit available .
Offices
Acoustiguide is owned and managed by Espro-Acoustiguide Group. The Group operates worldwide through 7 subsidiaries and a network of distributors with offices in New York, London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Amsterdam, Salzburg, Madrid, Tel Aviv, Taipei, Sydney, St. Petersburg, Prague, Mexico City, Shanghai, and Tokyo. The company's list of clients include New York's MoMA and the UN visitor center, San Francisco's Asian Art Museum, Paris' Musèe du Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, and Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, London's Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London, Jerusalem's Israel Museum, Taipei's 101 Tower, Beijing's National Museum of China, and Sydney's Opera House.

Competitors
Systems such as Acoustiguide's, and those of competitors Tour-Mate, ArtTours , and Cuseum, are identified as providing "industrial-strength systems that can be used as audio guides in museums and other cultural heritage sites and support typically a very wide range of human languages (reaching 20 or more.)"
Among competitors, there is another company, which was set up in Italy in 1959, almost at the same time as Acoustiguide and which is still active in the digital interpretation field: D'Uva www.duva.eu. Even later in 2017 the small start-up in Hamburg named iridea is founded which creates innovative guides for audio, video or AR using object or picture recognition as well as beacon- or GPS-signals for triggering the content of the POI.

The Donegal vs Dublin football match that took place on 28 August 2011 at Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland, was the second semi-final match of the 2011 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Both teams reached the stage with an undefeated record in the competition. The game was administered by Laois officials led by Stradbally referee Maurice Deegan. The result was a scoreline unprecedented in recent Championship history; Donegal led 0–4 – 0–2 at half time, Dublin won the second half 0–6 – 0–2 and the game by a scoreline of 0–08 - 0-06. The match was played in front of a sell-out crowd.
The number of points shared was the lowest between the teams in Championship history. The first half produced one of the lowest scorelines in Championship history and the final scoreline had not been seen at this level of the sport since the 1950s, an era when games lasted ten minutes less. This was also the first Championship loss of Jim McGuinness's successful reign as Donegal manager, and one of only four. It became a defining game in the evolution of the then revolutionary tactic that was to become known as The System.
Background
Neither side had won an All-Ireland title since the 1990s. Neither side had even appeared in an All-Ireland final in all that time. Dublin had lost their previous four All-Ireland semi-finals. Former Kerry footballer Pat Spillane, in his capacity as an analyst for RTÉ Television, tipped an easy win for Dublin. A heavy rain shower fell ahead of the match.
Match
First half
The first significant action was a free won by Dublin's Barry Cahill in the second minute. Cahill called forward his goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton to take a shot. Cluxton's attempt drifted to the left and wide. In the sixth minute Donegal's Christy Toye was hauled down by two Dublin players. Michael Murphy sent the resulting free wide. In the seventh minute Dublin's Alan Brogan shot spectacularly wide. A high challenge from Dublin's James McCarthy led to a yellow card in the eight minute. Colm McFadden scored the resulting free from inside the 45-metre line to give the opening point of the match to Donegal. In the tenth minute Dublin's Bernard Brogan ran through on the Donegal goal but his shot past Paul Durcan went to the left and wide. He made up for this two minutes later when he equalised by putting over Dublin's opening point from a free. The first 14 minutes of the match featured 12 frees. In the twenty-first minute Dublin's Bernard Brogan again attempted to score a point but his effort went to the right and wide. In the game's twenty-fourth minute Ryan Bradley restored Donegal's lead, evading the efforts of most of Dublin's players to send the ball between the posts and score the first point from play. One minute later, Bernard Brogan sent over a free to bring the game level again. In the twenty-ninth minute Kevin Cassidy sent Donegal into the lead again with a point from play via the outside of his boot. Colm McFadden added another point from play a minute later to send Donegal into a two-point lead for the first time. One minute after that, Alan Brogan sent another effort to the right and wide. Diarmuid Connolly and Cluxton added to Dublin's wide tally just before the break. Dublin did not score from play in the first half.
Second half
Donegal opened the second half by adding to their lead. Colm McFadden's shot from play went over the bar to give him his third point of the game. More Dublin wides followed until their goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton stepped up to send a free over the Donegal bar and score his first point of the game. McFadden duly responded by sending another free over Cluxton's bar and Donegal opened up a three-point lead on a scoreline of 0–6 – 0–3. In the forty-ninth minute Dublin's Cian O'Sullivan showed his frustration by lashing out at Rory Kavanagh, sending him flat onto the Croke Park turf. O'Sullivan picked up a yellow card for his trouble. In the fifty-second minute Bernard Brogan sent over a simple free to reduce the gap between the sides, with Cluxton sending over a '45 soon afterwards. In the fifty-seventh minute Diarmaid Connolly won a free close to the Donegal goal but, before it was taken, Connolly lost his cool and raised a fist to the face of a Donegal player. The referee Maurice Deegan consulted his lineman Rory Hickey before showing Connolly the red card and changing his decision to a hop-ball which Donegal cleared. With ten minutes left Kevin McManamon sent over Dublin's first point from play, to bring the game level. With eight minutes left Bryan Cullen gave Dublin the lead with his team's second point from play. Five minutes later Bernard Brogan sent a free over Paul Durcan's bar to give Dublin a two-point lead. In stoppage time Durcan intercepted McManamon's pass to Michael Darragh MacAuley to prevent what looked a certain Dublin goal. Then Cluxton sent another free wide.
Details
Reactions
The outcome confounded experts across the sport. Pat Spillane, uncertain what to make of proceedings after witnessing the first half, famously branded Donegal's style of play "Shi'ite football" live in front of the nation during his attempted half-time analysis. This was also the origin of Spillane's infamous calling for McGuinness to be sent to The Hague and tried there for "crimes against football", a comment which would return to haunt him on many occasions for many years afterwards. His colleague, the former Meath footballer Colm O'Rourke, speaking on television after the match, called it "the game from hell". Booing rang out around the stadium from Dublin fans, impatient at their team's lethargic manner of playing. Those who followed the English game were heard to wryly, yet accurately, observe with the score at 0–1 – 0–1 after twenty minutes of play that Arsenal and Manchester United were serving up scores at a quicker rate with the end result in that match being 8–2.
Vincent Hogan would later use the match as an example to brand McGuinness "a leader of sheep" in a famous newspaper article, which backfired on him when he mocked what Donegal would offer in the 2012 season — they won the All-Ireland title that year. McGuinness later described the 2011 Championship meeting with Dublin as "a game that came too soon" for his team.
Aftermath
Dublin would go on to become the dominant side of that decade, while Donegal would fade into oblivion after their anomalous 2012 victory. When they met again at the same stage of the 2014 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, it was possible for commentators to describe 28 August 2011 as "the day that shook football's landscape to the core" in sarcastic and derogatory terms, and the match as "one of the landmark games" in the history of its sport.

Verano is a surname of Basque origin. as a word it means "summer" in the Spanish language but as a family name in the Basque language is "a habitational name from a town in Biscay province, Basque Country in Spain", and usually applies to the descendants of the Verano family, an old basque noble family originally from Biscay province in Basque Country. It's also connected to two important Italian cities, Camerino and Ferrara, The surname Verano has been found in Camerino from as early as the 13th–16th centuries, first with the title of Vicars of the Holy See. The term Verano may have originated from the Basque "Berano", a name which is popular and common among the residents of those who lived in a town within Biscay Country. A bishop has even been cited from there in 1482. The surname Verano is distributed between Verano's family in some countries such Spain (The former Spanish colonies) in the Philippines where substantial numbers of Basques emigrated to, including the United States, France, Italy, Malta, and Mexico. In the United States of America, one of the first Veranos to be recorded on fresh immigration records were from Italy and Hawaii. However, since they possessed Italian and Spanish names, it can be concluded that they were descendants of those Spaniards or Europeans who landed on the shores Oceania when there was Colonialism in the islands. There are about 9,102 Documents about Verano Ancestry, 7,223 Birth, Marriage and Deaths and 665 Immigration Records in the USA.

NGC 1559 is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Reticulum. It is also a Seyfert galaxy. Although it was originally thought to be a member of the Dorado Group, subsequent observations have shown that it is in fact not a member of any galaxy group or cluster and does not have any nearby companions. NGC 1559 has massive spiral arms and strong star formation. It contains a small bar which is oriented nearly east-west and spans 40″. Its bar and disc are the source of very strong radio emissions.
In 2005, a Type 1a supernova, (SN 2005df) was observed. Two other supernovae discovered in NGC 1559 were SN 1984J and SN 1986L. All three were discovered by Australian amateur astronomer Robert Evans.

This is a list of sovereign states in the 2020s, giving an overview of states around the world during the period between 1 January 2020 and the present day. It contains 210 entries, arranged alphabetically, with information on the status and recognition of their sovereignty. It includes 195 widely recognized sovereign states, two associated states, and 13 entities which claim an effective sovereignty but are considered de jure constituents of other powers by the general international community.
Members or observers of the United Nations
Non-UN members or observers
Other entities
Excluded from the list above are the following noteworthy entities which either were not fully sovereign or did not claim to be independent:
as a whole has no government and no permanent population. Seven states claim portions of Antarctica and five of these have reciprocally recognised one another's claims. These claims, which were regulated by the Antarctic Treaty System, were neither recognised nor disputed by any other signatory state.
The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone was a de facto self-governing entity that existed from 8 June 2020 to 1 July 2020 and was not recognized by any other state. Claimed by the United States as part of the State of Washington's King County.
The European Union is a sui generis supranational organisation which had 27 (then 28) member states. The member states had transferred a measure of their legislative, executive, and judicial powers to the institutions of the EU, and as such the EU had some elements of sovereignty, without generally being considered a sovereign state. The European Union did not claim to be a sovereign state and had only limited capacity for relations with other states.
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is a former proto-state and current insurgent group in primarily Iraq and Syria among other nations. ISlL used to be considered a quasi-state, but is no longer considered as such.
The Sovereign Military Order of Malta is a United Nations observer. The order had bi-lateral diplomatic relations with a large number of states, but has no territory other than extraterritorial areas within Rome and Malta. The order's Constitution stated: "The Order is a subject of international law and exercises sovereign functions." Although the order frequently asserted its sovereignty, it did not claim to be a sovereign state. It lacked a defined territory. Since all its members were citizens of other states, almost all of them lived in their native countries, and those who resided in the order's extraterritorial properties in Rome did so only in connection with their official duties, the order lacked the characteristic of having a permanent population.
The Tigray Region is recognized as a region of Ethiopia. Despite being at war with the rest of Ethiopia, it isn't commonly considered a soveriegn state and is more of an insurgency or proto-state.

Torvald Tu (22 July 1893 – 15 January 1955) was a Norwegian poet, playwright, novelist and writer of humoresques.
He was born in Klepp as a son of farmers. His literary debut was the 1914 play Storbrekkmyri, and his first poetry collection Blomar fraa heid came in 1915. He wrote in Nynorsk with strong hints of his own Jæren dialect. His most successful play was the musical comedy Kjærleik på Lykteland, issued in 1923 and staged at Det Norske Teatret. The play had music composed by Per Reidarson, and was produced by Agnes Mowinckel, with Lars Tvinde as the elder bachelor, and Mally Haaland portraying the anxious-to-be-married Anna Saueland. The play was one of the greatest successes for Det Norske Teatret, and simultaneously went on two parallel tours. In 1929 Tu's comedy Friarleik på Liland, with music by Trygve Stangeland, was staged at Det Norske Teatret. His comedy Bertels gjenvordigheter, was played 133 times in 1933 at Komedieteatret in Bergen, which also staged several others of his plays. His works became very popular at Nynorsk amateur theatres throughout the country.
In total he issued over fifty books, and some works have been translated to other languages, notably Swedish and Faroese. He also contributed to newspapers and magazines. His song Sjå Jæren, gamle Jæren has later achieved status as a "national" song for the Jæren district, and his popular humoresques have seen new and increasing popularity in later years. After the German occupation of Norway ended in 1945, a minor controversy arose as Tu was admonished by the Norwegian Authors' Union for not following the union policy to "strike" during the occupation—Tu had released four titles in 1943.
From 1937 he lived with musician Trygve Johannes Stangeland (1898–1969). They also cooperated professionally on many occasions. Tu died in January 1955 near his home.

Robert Marshall (c.1695–1774) was an Irish judge. He is remembered chiefly as co-executor and legatee of Esther Vanhomrigh, the beloved "Vanessa" of Jonathan Swift, although he was not a close friend of hers; indeed it is possible that they never met.
Personal life
He was born in Clonmel, County Tipperary, son of John Marshall, styled as a "gentleman" and his wife Catherine. He was educated at Clonmel Free School and Kilkenny College, entered Middle Temple in 1718 and was called to the Irish Bar in 1723. His father committed suicide in Clonmel in 1717.
He moved house several times before buying a country house at Monkstown, County Dublin. In 1741 he married a great heiress, Mary Wooley, daughter of Benjamin Wooley of East Sheen, near London, who is said to have brought him a dowry of £30,000. She died childless in 1743. He outlived her by thirty years, despite his own increasing ill-health, which led to frequent visits to England in hope of a cure. He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Waterford.
Legal and political career
He was appointed Third Serjeant in 1738 and Second Serjeant in 1741. As a barrister he made his reputation in the celebrated Annesley case, in which James Annesley claimed to be the rightful Earl of Anglesey against the rival claim of his uncle, which is often said to be the inspiration for the novel Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson. His practice was lucrative, though the bulk of what became a great fortune was undoubtedly due to his advantageous marriage to Mary Wooley. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Clonmel and was generally a reliable Government supporter; he was also Recorder of Clonmel at intervals between 1727 and 1747, and served as Mayor of Clonmel four times. He was High Sheriff of County Tipperary in 1729. He also took an interest in the affairs of County Waterford, particularly after the marriage of his sister Elizabeth to Thomas Christmas MP, the head of a family which played a leading role in the political life of Waterford for several generations. He became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) in 1754 and retired in 1766.
Vanessa
In 1723 the intense friendship between Jonathan Swift and Esther Vanhomrigh, for whom he created the name Vanessa, ended in a violent quarrel about another woman whom he had loved for many years, Esther Johnson (whom he nicknamed "Stella"); Swift may secretly have married Stella in 1716, although the truth of this is now impossible to determine. The quarrel arose when Vanessa apparently asked Swift not to see Stella again, and he refused. Vanessa, who was seriously ill with tuberculosis and died a few months later, revoked the will she had made in Swift's favour and made a new will, dividing her estate between Marshall and George Berkeley, later to be a celebrated philosopher and Bishop of Cloyne, and appointing them as her joint executors. Her choice of legatee caused a good deal of surprise since it does not seem that she knew either man well (nor did they apparently know each other): indeed it has been suggested that she may never have met either of them. In the event much of the estate was dissipated in a lawsuit. There is a tradition that Marshall and Berkeley disobeyed a provision in the will that they publish all of Swift's correspondence with Vanessa, but in fact, no such provision seems to have existed. Marshall did preserve copies of the correspondence. Swift, though he had no quarrel with Berkeley, and indeed respected him, regarded Marshall (whom he called a "scoundrel"), as his enemy. Admittedly Swift had a notoriously poor opinion of lawyers in general.

Wayne Alan Harold (born November 7, 1964) is an American independent editor, publisher and filmmaker who lives in Kent, Ohio. During his career he has formed lasting creative relationships with both Toby Radloff and P. Craig Russell.
Harold is a 1988 graduate of Kent State University with a degree in communications and film. Soon after graduating from Kent State, Harold began producing short comedic segments for MTV about Cleveland-based "genuine nerd" Toby Radloff. In the 1990s, Harold co-created the cult horror comedy feature films Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd, both of which starred Radloff. He continued working with Radloff in the 1999 cult film Townies, and then the 2006 documentary Genuine Nerd.
Harold's 2009 documentary, Night Music: The Art of P. Craig Russell, has had public screenings at the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus. In 2012, he created the first volume of P. Craig Russell's Guide to Graphic Storytelling, an educational video series that teaches effective sequential storytelling techniques. Five follow-up volumes were subsequently produced.
Harold is the founder of the Kent Comic Arts Fest in Kent, Ohio. The debut event was held at Kent State University on October 19, 2013. Guests included P. Craig Russell, Jill Thompson and other artists of the graphic novel adaptation of Neil Gaiman's The Graveyard Book.
In 2015, he edited, designed and published the P. Craig Russell Sketchbook Archives, a hardcover coffee-table style art book featuring career-spanning sketch work by artist P. Craig Russell.
In 2017, Harold launched a series of Fine Art Editions, featuring oversized 12"x17" Artist's Edition-type books that feature comic art pages printed the same size as the original art board (and scanned from the original art wherever possible). The initial volume in the series is P. Craig Russell's Jungle Book and Other Stories.

Aymeric Eugène Robert d'Humières (2 March 1868 – 26 April 1915) was a French man of letters, poet, chronicler, translator and theatre director.
Biography
Robert d'Humières was born on 2 March 1868 at the Château de Conros, Arpajon-sur-Cère in Cantal département. A former pupil of Saint-Cyr, he returned to civilian life. Called up for the duration of the First World War as captain with the 4e régiment de zouaves, he was killed on 26 April 1915 at Lizerne. (in the defence of Ypres). He was cited in army orders as être mort en héros en combattant à la tête de son unité ("died heroically in combat at the head of his unit"). He was posthumously awarded the title of Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur.
He was the son of Count Aymeric d'Humières (1839–1923) and the Countess, née Norah Kelly, an American of Irish origin, born in Connecticut (1842–1922), the daughter of Robert Kelly. In 1905, he married Marie de Dampierre (1881–1917); they had three children.
A friend of Marcel Proust, he helped the latter with his translation of John Ruskin's The Bible of Amiens.
He was friend of Oscar Wilde who gives him a dedicated copy of his Poems (Paris, collection Jean-David Jumeau-Lafond).
Career
If the name of Robert d'Humières is still known today, it is thanks to his friendship with Proust and also because of the beautiful translations he made (in collaboration with Louis Fabulet) of the works of Rudyard Kipling.
He was also an author whose personal genius, humanism, culture, scientific curiosity and first class poetic inspiration, clearly illustrate French literature. His penetrating, sometimes prophetic and always highly enlightened reflection, place him amongst the most inspired philosophers.
He was made director of the théâtre des Arts, from 1907 to 1909. He presented his silent drama The Tragedy of Salome with the American dancer Loie Fuller in his first season; Diaghilev reused this poem for his ballet 1913.
Works
His own works remain to be discovered. He developed an aesthetic of high and enlightened thoughts that is expressed in a dazzling form, sometimes mixing poetry and science in a union of surprising beauty. His epistolary novel, Lettres volées (1911), is of no less value than Les Liaisons dangereuses.
1894 La Belle au Bois Dormant, dramatic fairy tale in three acts written in collaboration with Henry Bataille and premiered on 24 May 1894.
1895 Les Temps nouveaux de M. de Castellane, article published in La Revue blanche no.56, 1 October 1895.

Great Central Mines was an Australian gold mining company.
The company lost its independence in 1999, when it was taken over by Normandy Mining, and was renamed Normandy Yandal Operations Limited in 2000. The company's takeover however led to lengthy court proceedings, initiated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which only finalised in February 2003. At this stage, Normandy Mining itself had been taken over by the Newmont Mining Corporation.
History
Names and listings
The company started its existence under the name of Great Central Mines NL, changing its name to Great Central Mines Limited on 19 December 1996. The company was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange under the code GCM.
Great Central Mines
Great Central Mines was led by the ordained Rabbi Joseph Gutnick, who was, after almost having been ruined by the 1987 stock market crash, advised by the Rebbe Menachem Schneerson to go back to the Australian desert and search for "gold and diamonds".
In 1988, Gutnick's company discovered the deposit which was to become the Plutonic Gold Mine in Western Australia, which he sold for A$50 million.
GCM acquired the majority of the Bronzewing deposit from Mark Creasy, a sale which earned the later an entry into the Guinness Book of Records, becoming the prospector receiving the richest payout, having received A$115 million for it from GCM. The company purchased the remaining 30% of Bronzewing it didn't own in early 1995 for US$89 million, together with the remaining 49% stake of the Jundee Gold Mine it hadn't owned previously.
By 1996, GCM was worth A$500 million, but Gutnick's web of companies was built on debt.
On 21 August 1997, GCM made an offer for Wiluna Mines Limited, owner of the Wiluna Gold Mine. This offer closed on 10 October 1997 and was followed by a second offer, lasting until 2 January 1998. GCM acquired the necessary 90% acceptance in the second offer and moved to compulsory acquisition on 5 January 1998.
Normandy takeover
In early 1999, Normandy Mining made an offer for GCM through Yandal Gold, a company it owned a 49.9% interest in. This offer came under investigation from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which demanded a termination of the offer on 23 March 1999. Gutnick and Normandy chairman Robert Champion de Crespigny were found to have illegally structured a takeover of the company and Gutnick was ordered to return $28.5 million to investors. The court found that their behaviour in jointly bidding $450 million earlier that year for Great Central Mines was unlawful and deceptive. Both Gutnick and Crespigny had shareholdings in GCM before this bid was launched, and they agreed together to form the Yandal Gold company. The court found however, that it was only Gutnick who received any benefit and it was therefore him who had to pay the $28.5 million. Justice Ron Merkel of the Federal Court found that Yandal Gold, jointly owned by Gutnick's family company Edensor Nominees, and Normandy, acted illegally during the takeover. Court proceedings finalised only in February 2003, after Normandy Mining itself had ceased to exist.
The deal nevertheless went ahead and brought the Bronzewing, Jundee and Wiluna Gold Mine's to Normandy. The ongoing court proceedings however meant, that GCM could not be delisted from the ASX, as planned, on 22 June 1999. Instead, GCM continued to trade, acquiring the Mt McClure Gold Mine, near Bronzewing, in September 1999 and integrating it in the later.
On 5 April 2000, Joseph Gutnick, Robert Champion de Crespigny and Ian Gould resigned as directors of the company, to be replaced by three new directors.
Post-takeover
GCM became Normandy Yandal Operations Limited on 30 June 2000, changing its Australian Securities Exchange code to NYY. Normandy Yandal, in turn, was renamed Newmont Yandal Operations Limited, after the takeover of Normandy by Newmont, on 24 May 2002. At the end of court proceedings, on 28 February 2003, Newmont Yandal was delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange. The final court decision modified the original court order such that former GCM shareholders were not be able to reacquire their shares in GCM, making the existence of the company for legal reasons unnecessary.
Operations
GCM operated three gold mines, all in Western Australia, during its existence:
Bronzewing Gold Mine: Developed by GCM in the early 1990s, Bronzwing produced approximately 250,000 to 300,000 ounces of gold annually.
Jundee-Nimary Gold Mine: Developed by GCM in the mid-1990s, Jundee and Nimery produced approximately 300,000 ounces of gold annually, with two-thirds of it produced from Jundee and one third from nearby Nimary.
Wiluna Gold Mine: Acquired in late 1997, the Wiluna mine produced approximately 130,000 ounces of gold annually under GCM.

Richard John Smale Edis (1 September 1943 – 10 April 2002) was a British diplomat who served as UK High Commissioner to Mozambique, and UK ambassador to Tunisia, and Algeria.
Biography
Richard Edis was born on 1 September 1943 at Welwyn Garden City to Denis Edis and Sylvia (née Smale), was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and read history at St Catharine's College, Cambridge.
Edis joined the Foreign Office and Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service in 1966, serving in Nairobi; and in New York City and Geneva at the United Nations.
He was appointed UK High Commissioner to Mozambique in 1992, at the time of the Rome General Peace Accords signed between the government of Mozambique and RENAMO, ending the 16-year long Mozambican Civil War; he is credited with helping - with other foreign missions - to keep the fragile peace, notably by his relationship with RENAMO leader Afonso Dhlakama. Multi-party elections held in 1994 ushered in a democratic period for the country; Edis played a key role by dissuading RENAMO and other opposition parties - aggrieved by electoral-technical issues - from declaring a boycott on the night before the poll. In 1995, Mozambique joined the Commonwealth of Nations. Edis was next posted as UK ambassador to Tunisia in 1995 through to 1999. His last posting was as UK ambassador to Algeria from 2001 to 2002.
Edis married Genevieve Cerisoles in 1971; the couple had three sons. He served, with his wife, as Special Constables with the Metropolitan Police during his UK postings.
He was made Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1994.
He died on 10 April 2002. His sons Rupert and Jamyn established The Richard Edis Travel Award Fund at St Catharine's College, providing one or two students each year with substantial financial help to travel during vacations. Rupert Edis notes his belief that the great efforts his father made in Mozambique contributed to his early death.

Harrison Gray Otis Blake (March 17, 1818 – April 16, 1876) was a U.S. Representative from Ohio.
Born in Newfane, Vermont, Blake moved to Salem, New York, and in 1830 to Guilford, Ohio. He received his education at public schools, later studying medicine at Seville for one year. In 1836, he moved to Medina, where he engaged in mercantile pursuits and studied law. He was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Medina. From 1846 to 1847, he served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, and was elected to the Ohio State Senate in 1848, serving as that chamber's president.
Blake was elected as a Republican to the 36th United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Cyrus Spink, formerly Representative for Ohio's 14th congressional district. He was reelected to that Congress, serving from October 11, 1859, to March 3, 1863. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1862 to the Thirty-eighth Congress, but instead, with the Civil War raging, entered the United States Army in 1864. He served as colonel of the 166th Ohio Infantry, a Hundred Days Regiment. Blake was mayor of Medina from 1870 to 1872.
After the war, he declined the appointment of Governor of Idaho Territory, resuming the practice of law and maintaining an interest in banking and mercantile pursuits. He served as delegate to the Loyalist Convention at Philadelphia in 1866, and died ten years later in Medina, Ohio, on April 16, 1876. He was interred in Spring Grove Cemetery.

USS Seven Seas (IX-68) was built by Bergsund M.V. Atkieb in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1912 and served the Swedish Navy as the training ship Abraham Rydberg. Acquired by the United States Navy from William S. Gubelmann of Marine Airways, Roslyn, New York, on 10 April 1942 and placed in service on 5 May 1942.
Service history
Seven Seas proceeded to the 7th Naval District on 8 May 1942, arriving at Key West, Florida, later that month. On 9 April, the auxiliary, full-rigged ship assumed duties as station ship at Key West.
Seven Seas remained at Key West until after the heyday of coastal U-boat strikes. As the dangers lessened, she was placed out of service and laid up at the Coast Guard Patrol Base, Port Everglades, Florida, on 22 May 1944. Seven Seas was struck from the Navy List on 29 July 1944.

Farrington of the F.O. is a British television comedy series by Dick Sharples about the staff of the British Consulate in "one of the armpits of Latin America". It was produced by Yorkshire Television and broadcast from 1986 to 1987. Its second, and final, series was simply called Farrington.
Plot
Harriet Farrington arrives to take charge at a small, unimportant British Consulate. She is horrified to find out how indolent and scheming her staff are, and - with more than a hint of Margaret Thatcher about her mannerisms - sets out to turn the Consulate around.
Characters
The major protagonists were:
Harriet Farrington (Angela Thorne), the strict, no-nonsense new Consul-General.
Annie Begley (Joan Sims), Harriet's only friend at the consulate, and the least incompetent of her staff.
Major Percival Willoughby-Gore (John Quayle), a devious, lecherous, upper-class twit - and Harriet's would-be nemesis. Sadly, he's not quite as clever as Harriet and finds his schemes are frequently found out and squashed by her.
Fidel Sanchez (Tony Haygarth), the consulate's resident chauffeur. He always has his eye out to find ways to make a bit more cash – but grows strangely fond of Harriet as time goes on.
Miguel (Freddie Earlle), a jovial, but incompetent relative of Fidel. Miguel appears in two episodes of series two, although Earlle also appeared as a different character in series one.
Sarah Lawrence (Judy Cornwell) is Harriet's recently divorced houseguest. She horrifies her hostess by falling for the bumbling charms of Major Percy. Sarah appears in two episodes of series two.
Notable guest stars throughout the run of the two series included (in no particular order) Tim Barrett, Francesca Gonshaw, Jan Ravens, Ralph Bates, Annette Crosbie, Russell Hunter, Roger Hammond, Veronica Doran, Kevin Lloyd, Elizabeth Sellars, Edward de Souza, Robin Parkinson, Patsy Smart, and John Moreno. Sharples' earlier comedy shows included In Loving Memory and Hallelujah!.
Series
Farrington of the F.O. — (1986) — Yorkshire Television
First series (7 episodes) broadcast from 13 February to 27 March 1986
Farrington — (1987) — Yorkshire Television
Second series (7 episodes) broadcast from 3 June to 15 July 1987
Press Pack, Series Two
The following information is taken from the Press Pack released by Yorkshire TV to help publicise the series.
Carmen Gómez, who played Juanita in series 2, episode 1, and Delores Alvarez in series 2, episode 3, was born in North Africa and grew up in Gibraltar. She started her career presenting children's TV programme Romper Room. Her first book (Happy Musician) was due to be published at the same time she appeared in Farrington. Her brother is William Gomez, the classical guitarist and composer.
Tony Haygarth did not appear in series 2, episode 4 (We're Having a Heatwave) because he became snow-bound in Kent and was unable to reach Yorkshire TV's Leeds studios. Writer Dick Sharples performed a hasty re-write on the episode's script, and created the character of Miguel (played by Freddie Earlle) to cover for the absent Sanchez. As a 'thank-you' to Earlle, Miguel was also written into the following episode Who Wants to be a Billionaire?. Earlle had previously appeared in the final episode of series 1 as a particularly inept bandito chef.
The final scene in the final episode featured Harriet Farrington on board a British Airways jet. However, the actors never left the ground as they were filmed in a replica of a first-class cabin owned by the airline company. The company kept the set to help with stills, publicity and filming.

Stepan Andreevich Neustroev (; 12 August 1922 – 26 February 1998) was a Soviet officer, commander of the 1st Battalion in the 756th Regiment of the 150th Rifle Division. His unit stormed the Reichstag.
At a young age, Neustroev worked in the local mine as a mechanic. At June 1941, shortly before the war with Germany, he was conscripted and sent to the Cherkasy Infantry School. Lieutenant Neustroev was dispatched to the front on November, joining the 166th Infantry Division. He was severely wounded in a battle near Gzhatsk. He was wounded again on August 1942 and spent several months in hospital. At April 1943, Captain Neustroev was appointed commander of the 1st Battalion in the 756th Regiment, a post he held to the end of the war. The Battalion took part in the fighting for Belarus, Poland and the Baltics.
On 22 April 1945, the Battalion reached Berlin. On 30 April, at noon, Neustroev's men stormed the Reichstag, breaking through the main entrance and clearing the building. The following day, roughly at 03:00, his deputy for political affairs, Lieutenant Alexei Berest, together with two scouts—Mikhail Yegorov and Meliton Kantaria—raised the Victory Banner atop the Reichstag, next to Wilhelm I's statue.
On 8 May 1946, Neustroev was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union (Medal no. 6971). He retired from the army at 1953, holding the rank of lieutenant colonel. From 1957 to 1962, he served in the Internal troops, holding his old rank. He was stationed at Novouralsk.

Le Temps des bouffons (French for Time of the Buffoons) is a short film created (and narrated) in 1985 by Québécois director Pierre Falardeau.
It compares English rule in Ghana with Canadian dominance in Quebec by showing the 200th anniversary celebration of the Beaver Club of Montreal. Falardeau speaks slowly and angrily during scenes of the Canadian élite laughing and toasting each other, some in pseudo-Colonial costume.
The film was shot in 1985 but never shown until 1993.

Racebending was coined as a term of protest in 2009 as a response to the casting decisions for the live-action film adaptation of the television series Avatar: The Last Airbender. The starring roles of the show (Aang, Katara, and Sokka) were intended to be of Inuit descent, but were played by actors of European descent in the film. The initial protests such as "Saving the World with Postage," were created in a LiveJournal online forum that initially responded to the casting decisions by "inundating Paramount with protest mail." However, the cast went unaltered and when production began, the leaders of this protest responded by founding the advocacy group and accompanying website Racebending by "playfully borrowing the concept of manipulating elements (bending) from the Avatar universe."
The Racebending.com website defines "racebending" as, "situations where a media content creator (movie studio, publisher, etc.) has changed the race or ethnicity of a character. This is a longstanding Hollywood practice that has been historically used to discriminate against people of color." The website also states that the issue predates the coining of the term. Whitewashing, particularly common in film, "possesses a long tradition among the industry's most successful and venerated productions. Film history is replete with ignominious examples of white actors portraying characters of color."
Reasons for racebending
In the United States entertainment industry, Christina Shu Jien Chong has stated that racebending, whitewashing and an overall lack of representation of Asian Americans, as well as other minorities in the film industry is not due to lack of minority applicants, but instead due to lack of opportunities for minorities due to a connection-based culture in the entertainment industry created through implicit bias, and breakdowns, casting descriptions that usually include characteristics including a characters name, gender, age, race, minor personality traits and a brief life background. Chong does not consider breakdowns problematic in themselves, but as stated by Russell Robinson in a research article published by the Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository, they tend to discriminate against minorities in the entertainment industry. Part of Robinson's argument against breakdowns is that they are usually created by studio directors and 87% of directors are white. Robinson claims that these directors as well as others within the film industry can easily decide to change the race of a breakdown or of a character being adapted from another form of media. Robinson stated, "Any person in this decision-making chain might exclude an actor or an entire category of actors based on race or sex-based considerations, yet this discrimination would normally remain concealed from the excluded applicants and the public." According to Robinson, there are circles of "the wealthy elite in Hollywood" whose "implicit biases", covered up by breakdowns, lead to a significant amount of racebending and whitewashing within the film industry.
Many producers and directors in the film industry believe that it is not racial discrimination that leads to racebending, whitewashing, and an overall lack of minority representation in the film industry. Instead, many accredit it to a low number of minority applicants and the lack of funding they would receive if they did cast minorities in lead roles. In response to critic backlash after the release of the film 21, which is based on the true story of a group of Asian American students who in the film are portrayed mostly by Caucasian actors, producer Dana Brunetti claimed, "We would have loved to cast Asians in the lead roles, but the truth is, we didn't have access to any bankable Asian-American actors that we wanted." Furthermore, Ridley Scott claimed, after the release of his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, which faced a similar whitewashing controversy, "I can't mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain and say that my lead actor is Muhammad so-and-so from such-and-such. I'm just not going to get it financed. So the question doesn't even come up."
Examples
After the producers of The Last Airbender announced their decision to cast white actors Noah Ringer, Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone as the lead roles, the artists who had worked on the animated series it was based on created an anonymous LiveJournal website and started a letter-writing campaign. On the other hand, the actors portraying the antagonist characters are mainly Middle Eastern and Indian. Two fans from the LiveJournal website, known as glockgal and jedifreac, realized there were more cases regarding racebending other than The Last Airbender movie, leading them to create their own forum against racebending as a whole, Racebending.com.
In 2010, Racebending.com wrote a letter to Nickelodeon's CEO at the time, Jeff Dunn, regarding the audition restrictions for Power Rangers Samurai, the eighteenth season of the Power Rangers franchise. The producers of the show had restricted auditions for the Red Ranger to only white actors, but the casting was re-opened in June 2010 to actors of all ethnicities.
The film Exodus: Gods and Kings received significant backlash on social media before its release, due to white actors Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton and others being cast to play the roles of Egyptians, while black actors were only given the roles of slaves and thieves. Director Ridley Scott argued that they cast actors of other ethnicities as well (Iranians, Spaniards, Arabs, etc.) because Egyptians have varied ethnicities, and that the audience should not focus on only the white actors.
In 2010, Racebending.com and the Media Action Network for Asian Americans, alongside urging boycotts of The Last Airbender, also urged boycotts of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time as well, due to practices of racebending. Prince of Persia was criticized for casting white actors for the leads instead of actors of Iranian or Middle Eastern descent.
When Scarlett Johansson was cast in the lead role of Motoko Kusanagi in Ghost in the Shell, a live-action adaptation of the Japanese manga, there was fan backlash over the casting as, since the story is located within Japan, it was assumed that the actress to portray the character was meant to be of Japanese descent, and numerous fans signed petitions for a recast. Johansson addressed the issue in an interview with Marie Claire, stating that she never would have accepted the role if it meant taking it from an Asian actor. Johansson explained how she accepted the part because the main protagonist was female and "having a franchise with a female protagonist driving it is such a rare opportunity." Activists groups, such as the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) accused Johansson of lying that she would never portray or attempt to play someone of a different race. Their complaints stemmed from the idea that they believed Hollywood was not allowing Asians to portray Asian characters, and instead, was hiring white actors to take roles that could easily have been portrayed by an Asian actor and actress. Asian actors such as Constance Wu and Ming-Na Wen called for a boycott of the film because they thought it was unfair that the role did not go to an Asian woman. The Founding President of MANAA, Guy Aoki, stated, "Hollywood continues to make the same excuses, that there aren't big enough Asian/Asian American names to open a blockbuster film. Yet it has not developed a farm system where such actors get even third billing in most pictures. Without a conscientious effort, how will anyone ever break through and become familiar enough with audiences so producers will confidently allow them to topline a film? When will we ever break that glass ceiling?" The film spawned many different conversations on how to allow actors and actresses of minority groups to have the spotlight, as well as created discussions on how to end these endemic problems throughout Hollywood. In contrast to the controversy, Mamoru Oshii, director of the 1995 anime film, defended Johansson's casting and even cited the casting being in line with the themes, story, and source material of the book, specifically saying "The Major is a cyborg and her physical form is an entirely assumed one. The name 'Motoko Kusanagi' and her current body are not her original name and body, so there is no basis for saying that an Asian actress must portray her...I believe having Scarlett play Motoko was the best possible casting for this movie. I can only sense a political motive from the people opposing it, and I believe artistic expression must be free from politics."
Conversely, when Harry Potter received an addition to its installment with the stage play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, it was announced that the character Hermione Granger would be played by Noma Dumezweni, an African actress residing in England. Fans were displeased with this and called it "reverse whitewashing", but J. K. Rowling, the author of the original book series, argued that white skin was never specified in the making of Hermione, but rather being intelligent and smart.
Another example of racebending or 'blackwashing' occurred when Jodie Turner-Smith, who is a black woman, was cast to play Anne Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII and a white woman.
Other uses
The Racebending website acknowledges that often the terms "whitewashing" and "racebending" are used interchangeably, but that occasionally, the effects of racebending can have a positive impact. Racebending can, at times, result in increased representation for minorities if a "white role" is altered to be played by a minority. The website gave as examples of positive racebending Cinderella (Brandy Norwood) and Prince Christopher (Paolo Montalban) in The Wonderful World of Disney's retelling of Cinderella (1997), and Velma (Hayley Kiyoko) in Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins (2009), stating that, although minimal, "for communities of color, these casting decisions meant representation and meaningful inclusion in the American storytelling landscape."
Usage evolved, and by 2015, media studies academic Kristen J. Warner wrote that the term has "many definitions and contexts", from the film industry practice of color-blind casting to fan fiction. She describes how writers can "change the race and cultural specificity of central characters or pull a secondary character of color from the margins, transforming her into the central protagonist."
Pastes Abbey White said in 2016 that the term can apply to actors of color being cast in traditionally white roles. White said, "In the last several years, racebending has become a practice used more and more to help networks diversify their ensembles and capture a bigger audience. Not only has it resulted in more racial visibility on the small screen, but in a far more unexpected way, racebending can generate deeper and more significant depictions of characters."
Statistics
According to a 2016 University of Southern California report on diversity in entertainment within which 414 stories were sampled, 109 motion pictures and 305 broadcast, cable and digital series, "71.7% were white, 12.2% Black, 5.8% Hispanic/Latino, 5.1% Asian, 2.3% Middle Eastern and 3.1% other", in contrast to the United States Census Bureau's population estimates for July 2016 being "63.3% White, 12.6% Black, 16.2% Hispanic/Latino, 4.9% Asian, 2.1% mixed, 1.0% other." The University of Southern California report noted that it sampled all "independent speaking character utters one or more discernible and overt words (of any language) on screen. Nonverbal utterances are not considered words. Characters that are named are also considered speaking characters. Under rare circumstances, a group of nearly identical characters might speak at the exact same time or sequentially. Given their extreme homogeneous appearance, it is impossible to distinguish these characters from another. When this occurs, the coders are instructed to "group" the identical characters and code them as one unit." According to Christina Shu Jien Chong's article in the Asian Pacific American Law Journal, "Whites occupied 83.5% of lead roles while minorities occupied 16.5%; 9.5% Black, 2% Latino, 2.5% Asian, 0.5% Native American, and 2% Mixed/Other." According to Chong, when it comes to casting for major roles, racebending, whitewashing and implicit bias lead to an even more drastic underrepresentation of minorities in the entertainment industry.

Chihuahuan meadowlark (Sturnella lilianae), also known as Lilian's meadowlark, is a bird in the family Icteridae. It is found in northern Mexico and the southwestern portion of the United States. It is formerly usually treated as a subspecies of the eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna).
Taxonomy
The Chihuahuan meadowlark was formally described in 1930 by the American ornithologist Harry C. Oberholser as a subspecies of the eastern meadowlark based on a holotype that had been collected in the Huachuca Mountains of Arizona. Oberholser proposed the trinomial name Sturnella magna lilianae. The epithet lilianae was chosen to honor Lilian Hanna Baldwin (wife of Senator Samuel Prentiss Baldwin). It is now treated as a separate species based on the significant morphological, vocal and genomic differences between the Chihuahuan meadowlark and the other subspecies of the eastern meadowlark.
Two subspecies are recognised:
Sturnella lilianae lilianae Oberholser, 1930 – southwest USA and northwest Mexico (Chihuahuan Desert)
Sturnella lilianae auropectoralis Saunders, GB, 1934 – west-central Mexico

The 2010 German GP2 round was a GP2 Series motor race held on July 24 and 25, 2010 at Hockenheimring in Hockenheim, Germany. It was the sixth round of the 2010 GP2 Season. The race was used to support the 2010 German Grand Prix. The round marked the return to Hockenheim after the Nürburgring held the previous year's event, due to the German Grand Prix rotation.
Report
Feature Race
Pastor Maldonado extended his GP2 Series points lead by claiming his fourth victory of the season in the feature race at Hockenheim. The Rapax driver took the lead at the start when polesitter Charles Pic (Arden) was slow off the line, and aside from one lap during the pitstop cycle he led the entire race from there on. Addax's Sergio Pérez gave Maldonado some trouble during the first stint, but all of the Mexican's attempts to get past were easily defended. He was unable to summon the same sort of pace from his second set of tyres though, and Maldonado went on to take a comfortable 3.8-second win, with Pic completing the podium. Dani Clos (Racing Engineering) took fourth, while Jules Bianchi was fifth for ART, taking the fastest lap along the way, with Super Nova's Marcus Ericsson, Trident's Adrian Zaugg and iSport's Oliver Turvey completing the points-scorers. ART's Sam Bird had a nightmare race, starting towards the back of the field after crashing in qualifying and then being given a drivethrough penalty for causing a collision with Giedo van der Garde while fighting the Dutch Addax driver for 10th. It was also a difficult afternoon for series returnee Romain Grosjean, who was hit from behind by Racing Engineering's Christian Vietoris and had to pit for repairs. He rejoined the race three laps down, and DAMS' misery was completed when Ho-Pin Tung retired at mid-distance. The Chinese driver had joined his teammate in the pits at the end of the first lap after breaking his front wing on the Coloni Dallara of Alberto Valerio.
Sprint Race
Sergio Pérez took his third win of the season in the Hockenheim sprint race, while points leader Pastor Maldonado was eliminated in a late crash. Pérez's victory came fairly easily, the Addax driver picking off Trident's Adrian Zaugg and iSport's Oliver Turvey to take the lead on lap 10, and then building a gap that had grown to 6.3s by the time he took the flag. Polesitter Turvey was initially beaten off the line by Zaugg and Super Nova's Marcus Ericsson, but the Briton reclaimed second from Ericsson on the opening lap and then passed Zaugg for the lead a lap later. Zaugg had no answer to Turvey's pace, but he still had enough to hold on to third and give Trident its first podium since Mike Conway won in Monaco in 2008. But the real story of the race was Romain Grosjean's drive from the back of the field; the Franco-Swiss driver methodically gaining places to eventually find himself on the end of a four-way scrap for fifth with Racing Engineering's Dani Clos, ART's Sam Bird and Maldonado. Grosjean passed Maldonado for seventh with a couple of laps remaining, but things came to a head when Bird dived inside Clos for fifth at the hairpin. Grosjean tried to follow the Briton through and looked to have succeeded, but the opportunistic Maldonado had simultaneously tried to slip to the inside of both of them. Bird made his move stick, but Grosjean and Maldonado collided at the exit of the corner, putting both out of the race. The crash was subject to a post-race investigation by the stewards that the results of which have not yet been released. Bird's drive to fifth had been almost as impressive as Grosjean's effort given that he's started from 14th, and he finished just behind teammate Jules Bianchi. Clos held on for the final point.

The Imari Ton-Ten-Ton Festival is a fighting festival held every year in the city of Imari, Saga Prefecture, Japan. Beginning at the Imari Shrine, the festival is well known as one of the three great fighting festivals of Japan. The festival has been held since 1829. Two shrines, Aramikoshi and Danjiri, meet at various points throughout central Imari. They are smashed together simultaneously until one shrine falls back. This is done to the sound of a beating drum within the shrine Danjiri, the sound of which gives Ton Ten Ton its name.
Changes to the festival
In 1955, the number of matches was reduced and alcohol consumption by participants pulling the floats was banned. In 2006 there was a fatal accident involving a high school student. From 2013 there were changes made to the festival insuring the safety of participants. Battle outcomes are now decided ahead of time.
Event Date
The event is held annually for 3 days in the third weekend of October.

Émile Jules Marie Joseph François (24 May 1907, in Gingelom – 13 August 1984, in Zermatt) was a Belgian ophthalmologist.
Biography
François received his medical degree at the Catholic University of Louvain in 1930 and specialized in ophthalmology and ophthalmic surgery. He went into private practice in ophthalmology in Charleroi. He remained active there as a scientific researcher and in 1942 became a professor at Ghent University and the director of Ghent University's eye clinic.
François and his collaborators did important research on the anatomy of the central retinal artery and the central optic nerve artery. With Guy Verriest and Alfred De Rouck, Jules François did pioneer work in electrooculography. Early in his career he studied general ophthalmology, glaucoma, conjunctivitis, fever therapy, cataract and biochemistry. In the later part of his career he focused mainly on genetic studies, but retained his interest in general ophthalmology and surgery for eye diseases arising from diabetes.
François was the author or co-author of about 1,870 peer-reviewed articles and thirty-four books or book chapters in scientific texts. Some were standard works, such as L'hérédité en ophtalmologie, Les cataractes congénitales and (as co-author with Adolphe Franceschetti and Jean Babel) Les hérédo-degénéréscences choriorétiniennes. He also an editorial board member of more than 30 medical journals. His reputation attracted eye specialists from more than 30 countries to do their training at Ghent University.
He was the president and honorary president of International Council of Ophthalmology, the European Ophthalmological Society, and the Academia Ophthalmologica Internationalis and was elected a member of several national academies. He was made an honorary doctor in about twenty universities and was a guest of honor at over eighty national and international meetings.
In 1983 he was included in the Belgian hereditary nobility with the title of baron. He chose as his motto Ex oculo lux.
He married and was the father of a daughter.

Alexander Peli (1915–2007) was a Ukrainian-born Israeli encyclopedist, the supervising editor of the Encyclopaedia Hebraica. The project began using his mother's publishing house in 1946 with Peli supervising. The last volume was published in 1996.
Early life
Alexander Pilipovetsky was born in Kiev to Meir and Bracha Pilipovetsky (born Kutzenok). The parents had married the year before against the Kutzenok family's wishes. The Pilipovetskys moved to Palestine when he was six years old and he went to high school in Tel Aviv. In July 1921 his family were early settlers in the new city of Tel Aviv in Palestine (the land that was to become the State of Israel). He attended the University of Jerusalem graduating in History and Philosophy. He had been brought up with encyclopedias. His mother published the eight-volume General Encyclopedia. Peli's dream was to create a new encyclopedia in Hebrew.
In 1944 a committee was formed to work out the aims and objectives of a project to create an encyclopedia in Hebrew. In 1948 work was started, and Chaim Weizmann was the first president of the project. He was also to be the first president of the new state of Israel. Peli was appointed supervising editor and the first editor was Prof. Joseph Klausner The plans were drawn up and the first volume covered from Aleph to Australia.
The introduction to the first volume boldly announced that it was planned to complete the encyclopedia project in "five to six years". The breadth and depth of the project was large. One entry for Israel took up a complete volume. When Peli's first editor died, he appointed Benzion Netanyahu in 1948. Netanyaho had been recommended by Klausner, before his death. The encyclopedia continued to be firmly an Israeli publication. Netanyahu, who was to remain editor until 1962, was the father future Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
The third editor that Peli appointed was possibly the most controversial. Professor Yeshayahu Leibowitz caused some delays with his arguments about content, although Leibowitz was difficult outside as well as within the project team.
It was not until 1980 that another editor, Professor Joshua Prawer, managed to declare the encyclopedia as complete. Even after that date it took five years to publish an index, and there was always a need for amendments.
In 1986, Peli's mother, who owned Massada Publishing house, died. She left half the business to Alexander and half to his sister's family. The businesses did not prosper, and the rights to the encyclopedia were sold to Schocken in 1997. Peli was retained as a consultant.

Georges Philibert Charles Maroniez (17 January 1865, Douai – 11 December 1933, Paris) was a French painter, specializing in landscapes with figures.
Biography
Education and first works
Maroniez was the son of an industrialist who owned a sugar refinery in Montigny-en-Ostrevent. He displayed artistic talent at an early age, but – although not discouraged – was expected to pursue a more professional career. Accordingly, he studied law, and afterwards served as a magistrate in, successively, Boulogne-sur-Mer (1891), Avesnes-sur-Helpe (1894) and Cambrai (1897).
While attending law school, he also took courses at the École des Beaux-Arts of Douai and became a student of in Cantin. It was there that he met the painter Adrien Demont, the son-in-law of Jules Breton. Urged on by Breton, at the age of 22 he started exhibiting peasant genre and landscape scenes in Douai and Paris. He began vacationing in Wissant, where he stayed with Demont and his wife, Virginie Demont-Breton, painting the coastal scenery and becoming associated with the "École de Wissant", founded by Henri and Marie Duhem. In 1889, he became a member of the Société des Artistes Français.
At the annual Salon des artistes français, he was awarded a Honorable Mention in 1891, a 3rd Medal in 1905, and a 2nd Medal in 1906. Defying the label of "marine painter", he filled his genre scene paintings with Flemish realism. Using a luminous, caressing light, he transposed the grey country roads of his birthplace with light, and painted eloquent snowy landscapes. He painted ports of Brittany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as numerous scenes of the fisherman's life, especially at twilight or night. He captured the magnetic beauty of an ocean sunset, and the tranquility that beauty and light brings.
Inventions
Maroniez also became interested in photography and invented one of the first hand-held cameras, a device which he soon simplified, named the "Sphynx" and patented in 1891. The camera used a type of film invented by chemist Victor Planchon, a relative of his. He travelled widely throughout the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East, using his device to take over 1,600 images that are in the collection of the museum in Cambrai. Later he devised and patented a method of suppressing the vibrations and jerky movements produced by the cinematographs of the Lumière Brothers, which had its unveiling in 1899 at the Société Photographique in Cambrai.
In 1905, the success of his paintings and the anti-clerical attitudes of the Combes administration led him to resign from the judiciary, and to devote himself entirely to art.
World War I and maturity
In August 1914, Maroniez was drafted into Military Justice. In 1918 he was created a Knight of the Légion d'honneur. During the German occupation of north-east France, his studio was looted, and his wife was deported, with hundreds of other French civilian hostages, to Holzminden internment camp in Lower Saxony. The family was reunited only after the ceasefire; they relocated to Paris in 1919.
He subsequently took most of his inspiration from Brittany. His works were very popular but, according to some critics, became repetitive and too commercial. Over 800 paintings are attributed to him, of which the majority are in private collections. He died of a heart attack in 1933 and was interred in the family vault at Cambrai.

muru-D is an Australian startup accelerator founded in 2013. It is backed by the Australian telecommunications company Telstra. To date, over 44 startups have been through the program, with 42 still in operation.
muru-D, stylised with a lowercase 'm', is derived from the Sydney Aboriginal Eora word ‘Muru', meaning ‘path', and 'D' standing for digital: ‘path to digital.'
muru-D is currently based in 3 locations (Sydney, Singapore and Melbourne), with partner programs in Perth at Spacecubed and Brisbane at River City Labs. They also have space in Telstra's San Francisco office, providing alumni with US customer and investor connections.
History
muru-D was founded by Annie Parker and Mick Liubinkas in October 2013 after Telstra recognised that it needed to be more involved in the tech startup scene. It was officially opened by former Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull.
In 2015, muru-D expanded operations to Singapore due to its "fast-developing start-up ecosystem, pro-business policies and access to local capital."
At the end of 2016, Annie Parker left muru-D and was replaced by ex-Salesforce executive, Julie Trell.
In 2017, muru-D altered its funding model to be more founder friendly and attract later-stage startups. It also launched its new IoT themed space in Melbourne, based at Telstra's Gurrowa Labs.

The tree martin (Petrochelidon nigricans) is a member of the swallow family of passerine birds. It breeds in Australia, mostly south of latitude 20°S and on Timor island. It is migratory, wintering through most of Australia, New Guinea, Indonesia east of the Wallace Line and the Solomon Islands. It is a vagrant to New Zealand, where it has bred, and New Caledonia. This species is frequently placed in the genus Hirundo as Hirundo nigricans.
This is a bird of open woodland, preferably with large trees to provide nest holes. It is increasingly common in urban and suburban areas.
Description
The tree martin averages 13 cm long and has a shallowly forked tail. The adult has an iridescent blue back and crown, brown wings and tail, a rufous forehead and a whitish rump. The underparts are white. The sexes are similar, but young birds are duller and browner, with a paler forehead and pale fringes to the back and wing feathers.
The call of this vocal swallow is a tsweet and the song is a high-pitched twitter.
This species can be distinguished from other Australian swallows by its tail shape and pale rump. The most similar species, the fairy martin, has a rufous head and nape
The tree martin has three subspecies:
P. n. nigricans, the largest subspecies, breeds in eastern Australia, except northern Queensland, and is the form that has bred in New Zealand.
P. n. neglecta breeds in western and northern Australia. It is slightly smaller than nominate nigricans at 11–12 cm length.
P. n. timoriensis, the smallest subspecies, breeds mainly in Timor. It has dark streaks on the throat and neck.
Behaviour
Tree martins breed, depending on region, from July through to January, either in pairs or semi-colonially depending on nest site availability. Nests are constructed in natural holes in dead trees or rock crevices, but increasingly in artificial sites on bridges and buildings. This is most common in western Australia, where breeding occurs even in large cities like Adelaide and Perth. Tree martins also occasionally reline the nests of welcome swallows, and may displace the owners to obtain the nest.
The nest, unusually for a cliff swallow, is often made just from grass and leaves, but may be reinforced with mud. A mud and plant fibre cement is also used to reduce the width of the entrance to the breeding hole. The clutch is 3–5, usually four, brown and mauve-spotted white eggs, and this species is often double-brooded.
Tree martins have a fast twisting flight and feed higher than welcome swallows, often more than 6 m above the ground. They are frequently seen above the canopy of tall eucalyptus trees catching aerial insects, but will also feed on insect swarms low over water. This species can be highly gregarious when not breeding, and will form mixed flocks with fairy martins.

Gonioterma advocata is a moth of the family Depressariidae. It is found in French Guiana.
The wingspan is 25–26 mm. The forewings are lilac whitish, the costal edge white. The stigmata are dark fuscous, the plical and first discal small, the plical very obliquely posterior, the second discal moderate and transverse, with a cloudy sometimes divided small dark fuscous spot adjacent to it posteiiorly. There are scattered dark fuscous scales vaguely indicating a postmedian line and small dark fuscous spots on the costa at the middle and four-fifths, the second sending a strongly curved series of dark fuscous dots to the dorsum before the tornus. A marginal series of dark fuscous dots is found around the apex and termen. The hindwings are ochreous-grey whitish with a long dense whitish ochreous hair-pencil from the base lying in a subdorsal fold.

The Free Luxembourger Workers' Union (, abbreviated 'FLA') was a national trade union centre in Luxembourg, active between 1945 and 1965.
Founding
FLA was founded in 1945, after a split in the Luxembourg Workers' Union (LAV). The founders of FLA revolted against the anti-communist stance of the LAV leadership.
Communist links
Several of the FLA leaders were also members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Luxembourg, including the FLA president Nic Momper and general secretary Jos Grandgenet. The opponents of FLA accused it of being a communist front. LAV charged that the founding of FLA had been an idea hatched by the communist leader Dominique Urbany.
FLA was affiliated to the World Federation of Trade Unions.
Onset of the Cold War
At the time of its foundation FLA had around 10-11 000 members. As of 1946, FLA was the largest trade union centre amongst blue-collar workers. It was the majority union in metal industries and mines (with the exception of the mines at Dudelange, were LAV retained their prominence). However, it began to decline with the onset of the Cold War. From 1949 onwards the influence of FLA declined. An important factor contributing to this development was the exclusion of FLA from collective bargaining negotiations, a policy upheld by both the Luxembourgian employers and the trade union competitors (LAV and the LCGB). FLA was however able to retain a foothold in industries in small and medium-sized companies in rural areas of the country for some time.
In the 1950 elections to the Labour Chamber, FLA trailed behind both LAV and LCGB.
Later phase and dissolution
In 1958 FLA, along with three other WFTU-affiliated labour centres in Western Europe (CGT, CGIL, EVC) set up a Common Market Action Committee.
In 1965 FLA was dissolved. At the time of its dissolution, it had around 1500 members. Most of them joined LAV unions.

Guissona is a town and municipality located in the north of the comarca (county) of Segarra, in the province of Lleida, Catalonia, Spain. With 6,862 inhabitants (2015 census) Guissona (5,170 inhabitants in 2010) is the principal municipality in the northern half of Segarra and the second most populated in the county after Cervera (9,328 inhabitants in 2009). In addition to the populated place of Guissona, the municipality integrates the smaller place of Guarda-si-venes (31 inhabitants in 2007). The municipality is split into two parts, the bigger eastern part containing almost all the population.
In the last half century, the town has experienced an important economic development mainly due to meat production and the creation of a meat packing industry. Such development has run parallel to a fast demographic growth, from 3,060 inhabitants in 1998 to 6,145 in 2010. As a consequence, the municipality accounts for the highest percentage of immigrant population registered in the whole province.
Economy
The economy of Guissona is based on farming (plant crops, animal husbandry) and the food processing industry. Guissona is the baseof Grup Alimentari Guissona, an industrial and financial conglomerate originally created as an agricultural marketing cooperative, that distributes and commercializes the products of the area in its own chain stores.
Demographics

History
The first settlement known is the Iberian town of Iesso dating back to the early Iron Age (8th-9th century BC). Iesso was located in the Northern area of the present town (Plaça del Vell Pla). The coinage minted by the Iberian settlement, of which a few examples are found within the Iberian coin collection of the British Museum, include an unidentified Male head, to the right and to leave a club and an inscription. The reverse depicts a Horseman with a palm to the right and an Iberian inscription reading ieso below. These date from the late 2nd to the early 1st century BC.
The Romans conquered Iesso to transform it into a municipality. The town is mentioned by the Roman authors Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy. During that period a defensive wall was built that surrounded a more extensive surface than the present historic center. The remains of the Roman period are numerous, notably, the Roman thermae of the city. The archeological site includes the water supply of the actual Medieval enclosure, the wells of the public fountain, a number of headstones (e.g., the gravestone of Servilla Praepusa (2nd-3rd century AD), a sculpture of a Roman horseman, and the necropolis located in the area of Cal Mines.
Guissona probably housed the episcopal see until it was moved to La Seu d'Urgell as a consequence of the Muslin invasion of the area. In 975 AD the Christian Borrell II, Count of Barcelona conquered the town, although the Caliphate of Córdoba would conquer it back in 1015. By 1024, Guissona was recaptured and a rechristianization was instituted by Ermengol, bishop of Urgell.
In 1072, the Count Ermengol IV of Urgell started the construction of a Romanesque church named Església de Santa Maria de Guissona (Church of Saint Mary of Guissona). Several centuries later, the church was knocked down to build the new church. The construction of the church extended along the 17th and 18th centuries, the opening ceremony was in 1800. The final work would be a mixture of different phases of Baroque (altars, organ, choir stalls) and Neoclassical styles. During the Spanish Civil War, the organ and all the retables were destroyed.
In 1505, the construction started of Obra de Fluvià (or alternatively called Obra de santa Llúcia) in an estate previously acquired by the Bishop of Urgell, a building planned to be a residence for the Bishop. In 1514, the works were interrupted. Its remains are located a kilometre away to the northeast, near the confluence of the Fluvià River and its tributary, the Sió River. The remaining architectonic elements were made in a late Gothic style. The building was constructed on a squared floor plan with a central courtyard. The Diocese of Urgell also founded an Augustinian monastery, transformed into a secular collegiate church in the 15th century.
On 12 June 1837, there was a battle near the town fought by Carlist forces against the "Liberals" during the First Carlist War. The Carlist army commanded by the Infante Sebastian of Portugal and Spain was defeated by the Baron of Meer, general-in-chief of the military region of Catalonia. The Carlist army had previously left Navarre with the Carlist pretender of the crown, Carlos María Isidro de Borbón (the "Royal Expedition").

Brigadier General Óscar Humberto Mejía Víctores (9 December 1930 – 1 February 2016) was the 27th President of Guatemala from 8 August 1983 to 14 January 1986. A member of the military, he was president during the apex of repression and death squad activity in the Central American nation. When he was minister of defense, he rallied a coup against President José Efraín Ríos Montt, which he justified by declaring that the government was being abused by religious fanatics. He allowed for a return to democracy, with elections for a constituent assembly in 1984 followed by general elections in 1985.
Mejía Víctores regime
Return to democratic appearances
Ríos Montt was deposed on 8 August 1983 by his own Minister of Defense, General Mejía Víctores. Mejía Víctores became then de facto president and justified the coup by saying that "religious fanatics" were abusing their positions in the government and also because of "official corruption." Ríos Montt remained in politics, founding the Guatemalan Republican Front party in 1989. Elected to Congress, he was elected President of Congress in 1995 and 2000. Due to international pressure, as well as pressure from other Latin American nations, General Mejía Víctores allowed a gradual return to democracy in Guatemala. On 1 July 1984 an election was held for representatives to a Constituent Assembly to draft a democratic constitution. On 30 May 1985, the Constituent Assembly finished drafting a new constitution, which took effect immediately. General elections were scheduled, and civilian candidate Vinicio Cerezo was elected president. Revival of democratic government did not end the "disappearances" and death squad killings, as extrajudicial state violence had become an integral part of the political culture.
Continuing terror
By the time Mejía Víctores assumed power, the counterinsurgency under Lucas García and Ríos Montt had largely succeeded in its objective of detaching the insurgency from its civilian support base. Additionally, Guatemalan military intelligence (G-2) had succeeded in infiltrating most of the political institutions. It eradicated opponents in the government through terror and selective assassinations. The counterinsurgency program had militarized Guatemalan society, creating a fearful atmosphere of terror that suppressed most public agitation and insurgency. The military had consolidated its power in virtually all sectors of society.
In 1983, indigenous activist Rigoberta Menchú published a memoir of her life during that period, I, Rigoberta Menchú, An Indian Woman in Guatemala, which gained worldwide attention. She is the daughter of one of the peasant leaders who died in the Spanish Embassy massacre on 31 January 1980. She was later awarded the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize -on the year of the Fifth Centennial celebration of America Discovery- for her work in favor of broader social justice. Her memoir drew international attention to Guatemala and the nature of its institutional terrorism.
After the August 1983 coup, both the U.S. intelligence community and human rights observers noted that while cases of human rights abuses in rural Guatemala were on the decline, death squad activity in the city was on the rise. Additionally, as the levels of wholesale extrajudicial killings and massacres decreased, the rates of abduction and forced disappearance increased. The situation in Guatemala City soon began to resemble the situation under Lucas Garcia. In Mejia Víctores's first full month in power, the number of documented monthly kidnappings jumped from 12 in August to 56 in September. The victims included a number of U.S. Agency for International Development employees, officials from moderate and leftist political parties, and Catholic priests. In a report to the United Nations, Guatemala's Human Rights Commission reported 713 extrajudicial killings and 506 disappearances of Guatemalans in the period from January to September 1984. A secret United States Department of Defense report from March 1986 noted that from 8 August 1983 to 31 December 1985, there were a total of 2,883 recorded kidnappings (3.29 daily); and kidnappings averaged a total of 137 a month through 1984 (a total of approximately 1,644 cases). The report linked these violations to a systematic program of abduction and killing by the security forces under Mejía Víctores, noting, "while criminal activity accounts for a small percentage of the cases, and from time to time individuals ‘disappear' to go elsewhere, the security forces and paramilitary groups are responsible for most kidnappings. Insurgent groups do not now normally use kidnapping as a political tactic."
As under Lucas García, part of the modus operandi of government repression during the Mejía government involved interrogating victims at military bases, police stations, or government safe houses. Information about alleged connections with insurgents was "extracted through torture." The security forces used the information to make joint military/police raids on suspected guerrilla safe-houses throughout Guatemala City. In the process, the government secretly captured hundreds of individuals who were never seen again, or whose bodies were later found, showing signs of torture and mutilation. Such activities were often carried out by specialized units of the National Police. Between 1984 and 1986, the secret police (G-2) maintained an operations center for the counterinsurgency programs in southwest Guatemala at the southern airbase at Retalhuleu. There, the G-2 operated a clandestine interrogation center for suspected insurgents and collaborators. Captured suspects were reportedly detained in water-filled pits along the perimeter of the base, which was covered with cages. To avoid drowning, prisoners were forced to hold onto the cages over the pits. The bodies of prisoners tortured to death and live prisoners marked for disappearance were thrown out of IAI-201 Aravas by the Guatemalan Air Force over the Pacific Ocean ("death flights").
Along with former Presidents José Efraín Ríos Montt and Fernando Romeo Lucas García (deceased), President Mejía was charged with murder, kidnapping and genocide in a Spanish court.

Charles Rogers (2 August 1711– 2 January 1784) was an English custom official, known as an art collector. He also wrote on drawings, and became a Fellow of the Royal Society.
Life
Born on 2 August 1711, he was second surviving son of William and Isabella Rogers of Dean Street, Soho, London. In May 1731 he was placed in the custom house under William Townson, from whom he acquired a taste for the fine arts and book-collecting. Townson, the head in the Customs Office of the Certificate Office, collected books and prints.
Townson left his estate to Rogers in 1740, a bequest which included a house at 3 Laurence Pountney Lane, London, containing a museum of art treasures. Here Rogers in 1746 took up residence. There were other houses left to him, one in Mark Lane, London, and the other in Richmond, Surrey. In 1747 he became clerk of the certificates.
Through his friend Arthur Pond, Rogers was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 23 February 1752, and served on its council. He became Fellow of the Royal Society on 17 November 1757.
Rogers built up a print collection, with the help of friends, particular of Horatio Paul who lived abroad, and whose father Robert was a customs official, and Robert Udny. He was well connected in artistic and antiquarian circles. His personal assistant in the 1780s was Henry Walton Smith. He died unmarried on 2 January 1784, and was buried in the Laurence Pountney churchyard.
Works
The major work by Rogers was a series of facsimiles of original drawings from the masters, "engraved in tint" (mezzotint or aquatint, probably with etching). The book was issued in 1778, with the title A Collection of Prints in Imitation of Drawings … to which are annexed Lives of their Authors, with Explanatory and Critical Notes, 2 vols. imperial folio. The 112 plates were engraved mainly by Francesco Bartolozzi, William Wynne Ryland, James Basire, and Simon Watts, from drawings some of which were in Rogers's own collection. Other prominent collectors that had their works reproduced in the project included Thomas Hudson.
There were Raphael drawings used, from the collection of Joshua Reynolds. From the collection of Niccolò Gabburri, there were facsimiles of drawings that Rogers had acquired, in the 1762 sale by the dealer William Kent. One living artist was included, Vieira Lusitano.
In 1782 Rogers published an anonymous blank-verse translation of Dante's Inferno. He also contributed to Archæologia and The Gentleman's Magazine.
Legacy and the Cotton Collection
Rogers's collections passed at his death to William Cotton (d. 1791), who married his sister and heiress, and from him descended to his son, William Cotton, F.S.A., of the custom house. He then sold by auction in 1799 and 1801 a considerable portion of the collection; the sale occupied 24 days, and realised £3,886 10s.
The remainder, on Cotton's death in 1816, became the property of his son, William Cotton, who died in 1863. John Cotton (1802–1849), the ornithologist in Australia, was his younger brother. William Cotton matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford in 1811, aged 17, graduating B.A. in 1814, and M.A. in 1818. (He did not go into the church, as Alumni Oxonienses claims: the mistaken identity, confusion with William Cotton (died 1853) who was the son of Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton, 5th Baronet is pointed out in the Clergy of the Church of England database.) He lived at the Priory, Leatherhead, Surrey, and Highland House, Ivybridge, Devon. He published a catalogue of the Rogers collection in 1836; also on Plympton Erle and the family background of Joshua Reynolds, and Totnes; and was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.
After making some additions to the collection, Cotton handed it over in two instalments, in 1852 and 1862, to the proprietors of the Plymouth Public Library. An apartment was built for it, and was opened to the public on 1 June 1853 by the name of the Cottonian Library. The collection was moved in 1916 to the Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery.
The collection included four portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds, about five thousand prints, a few fine examples of early typography, illuminated manuscripts of the fifteenth century, carvings, models, casts, bronzes, and medals. A catalogue of the first part of the benefaction, compiled by Llewellynn Frederick William Jewitt, was printed in 1853.

Daniel Chavarría (23 November 1933 – 6 April 2018) was a Uruguayan revolutionary, writer and translator, who lived in Cuba since the 1960s. He had a son with Dora Salazar, Daniel Chavarria, and raised his sister.
Life and works
Daniel Chavarría was born in San José de Mayo, Uruguay.
In 1964, while Chavarría was living in Brazil, there was a military coup and he fled to work amongst the gold seekers in the Amazon. Later on, he fled to Cuba. There he began working as a Latin and Greek translator and teacher. Subsequently he began his career as a writer. Daniel Chavarría defined himself as a Uruguayan citizen and a Cuban writer.
Chavarría's style of writing is within the Latin American tradition of political writers, such as Gabriel García Márquez. He mentioned that as a child, he read Jules Verne, Emilio Salgari and Alexandre Dumas, and their influence can be detected in his writing. For example, in Tango for a Torturer, the influence of The Count of Monte Cristo is clear.
Chavarría's life and writings clearly show his communist and revolutionary background. He was a well known supporter of the Cuban Revolution.
In 2010, Chavarría won Cuba's National Prize for Literature.
Chavarría died in Havana on 6 April 2018, aged 84.

What I Saw: Reports from Berlin, 1920-1933 is a book of reportage by the writer Joseph Roth from the era of the Weimar Republic. The selection of pieces from Roth's large journalistic output was made by Michael Bienert and published in German in 1996. The English translation with the present title was made by Michael Hofmann and appeared in 2003. The pieces in the book "record the violent social and political paroxysms that constantly threatened to undo the fragile democracy" of those years, but some of them also report on more prosaic aspects of life in Berlin in those years, such as the public parks and the rising entertainment industry.
Roth arrived in Berlin in 1920. It became his main base for his journalistic and literary activities until 1933, when Hitler's seizure of power led him to leave Germany for France.
"Roth, like no other German writer of his time, ventured beyond Berlin's official veneer to the heart of the city, chronicling the lives of its forgotten inhabitants - the war cripples, the Jewish immigrants, the criminals, the bathhouse denizens. Warning early on of the threat posed by the Nazis, Roth evoked a landscape of moral bankruptcy and debauched beauty, a memorable portrait of a city at a critical moment in history."
The volume is divided into nine sections: What I Saw, The Jewish Quarter, Displaced Persons, Traffic, Berlin Under Construction, Bourgeoisie and Bohemians, Berlin's Pleasure Industry, An Apolitical Observer Goes to the Reichstag, and Look Back in Anger.
Critical reception
Writing of the work (as translated into English by Michael Hoffman), the critic Paul Bailey said the book " conjures up a city very like the one in Fritz Lang's masterpiece M - a city of lost souls; of thieves, pimps and beggars, of constant, hooting traffic and menacing, overlarge buildings." He called the collection, " a marvellous book. [-] It offers proof that Roth is as brilliant and original a journalist as he is a storyteller, casting his eye and cocking his ear where lesser writers never venture. [-] what a rich legacy of the humane imagination he has left us."

Bassignana (in Piedmontese dialect Bassgnan-na) is a municipality in the Province of Alessandria, Piedmont, northern Italy. The village is situated near the confluence of the Po River and the Tanaro river.
Main sights include remains of the castle, dating to Lombard times, and a Romanesque pieve (10th century) with 12th century Byzantine frescoes.
History
The first inhabitants of whom there is written news belonged to the Ligurian tribe of the Marici: they had crossed the Pennine in the postglacial era and had settled south of the Po river, in the area between Stradella and Casale Monferrato. Such people were closely linked to that of the Levi, who had settled further north: the founding of Ticinum, the modern Pavia, is attributed to the Levi and to the Marici. Some toponomastic traces of that period exist in the area: Bosco Marengo stems from Lucus Maricum and Pietra Marazzi from Petra Maricorum or Mariciorum.
In the 6th century BC the Po valley was occupied by Celtic peoples coming from the north and realistically also Bassignana had contacts and compenetrations with these peoples. In 222 BC the Roman commanders Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Gneus Cornelius Scipio conquered the whole area, which conquest was strengthened by the defeat of the Ligures in 166 BC under the consulate of Gaius Sulpicius Gallus. The toponym of the municipality dates back to that era, coming from the Roman family to whom ownership of the territory was attributed, the gens Bassinia.
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the barbaric incursions, Bassignana was first under the rule of the Lombards, then under that of the Franks. In the 10th century, the emperor Otto II attributed Bassignana to the jurisdiction of the bishop of Pavia, Pietro, a jurisdiction relating to the Pieve (plebs) and to the assets connected thereto. At the beginning of the 13th century the area was placed - still following the Emperor's order - under the jurisdiction of the Margrave Pallavicino, already podestà of Alessandria.
In 1350 it became part of the Duchy of Milan. After the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), it was assigned to the House of Savoy-Piedmont.
Many of its inhabitants emigrated to Memphis, in the United States, at the start of the 20th century.

Al-Fāriʿah bint Shaddād al-Murriyah () was a pre-Islamic Arabic poet, noteworthy both for being one of a relatively small number of known Medieval Arabic female poets, and for the famous short marthiyah she composed for her brother Mas‘ūd ibn Shaddād:
O my eye, be generous to Masʿūd son of Shaddād
with every teary gland
whose grief is manifest.
O whoever sees a lightning-flashing cloud
that I have gazed for through the night
pouring profuse rain upon the riverbed‘s
black basalt track.
With it would I water the grave of him I intend,
him whose grave is dear to me
though he were unredeemed.
Attester at councils, erector of edifices,
bracer of banners, burner of dams,
Slitter of camel throats, slayer of tyrants,
alighter on hilltops, breaker of bonds,
Orator of the eloquent, revolter of the ratified,
obstructor of water holes, dispeller of doubt,
Alighter at pasturelands, endurer of hardships,
dispeller of horrors, scaler of heights,
Gatherer of all virtues--as all who knew him knew--
his comrades' ornament, the tyrant‘s scourge.
O Abū Zurārah, do not be distant!
For every youth will one day be hostage
to stone slab and wooden bier.
O Banū Jarm. did you give your prisoner no drink?
May my soul be your ransom, O Masʿūd,
from a burning thirst!
The thruster of the wide-gashing thrust
that is followed by a profuse gush
after a boiling froth.
Who leaves his opponent with fingertips jaundiced.
and his clothes as if
mulberry-spattered.
The buyer of wineskins for guests
that alight in his courtyard.
to the destitute,
abundant morning rain.

Bunchosia armeniaca is a species in the family Malpighiaceae native to northwestern South America (Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil and Perú). Common names include cansaboca, ciruela de fraile, guaimaro, indano and cold-earth mamey.
Bunchosia armeniaca can attain a height of 20 meters, but it commonly grows to 5 meters. It can be found between 100–2600 m of elevation in a wide range of ecological habitats.
Bunchosia armeniaca yields a fruit that is very sweet and with cloying red pulp, which adheres strongly to the seeds, hence the Spanish etymology cansaboca (tired mouth). The two seeds in each berry are poisonous. Due to rapid spoilage on the tree, the fruit are often harvested while still a creamy-green and ripened to a red colour indoors.

Foodpanda (stylized as foodpanda) is an online food and grocery delivery platform owned by Berlin-based Delivery Hero. Foodpanda operates as the lead brand for Delivery Hero in Asia, with its headquarters in Singapore. It is currently the largest food and grocery delivery platform in Asia, outside of China, operating in 12 markets across Asia.
History
In 2012, Swiss Lukas Nagel and Rico Wyder established Foodpanda in Singapore, before expanding to Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.
A year later in 2013, Foodpanda was launched in Bangladesh and Romania. With more than 20,000 employees operating in their company, Foodpanda became the largest food delivery service in Bangladesh.
In 2014, the service expanded into the Balkans, Brunei, as well as the Philippines. In February 2014, Foodpanda acquired Eat Oye, a rival company in Pakistan. Global expansion of the Foodpanda business was led by Ralf Wenzel, Felix Plog and Ben Bauer.
In 2015, co-founder Rohit Chadda stepped down from the company. By 2016, none of the original managing directors or co-founders remained with the company. Its operations in Indonesia also shut down due to competition from flourishing app-based taxi-motorbike services, while the company sold its Delivery Club business in Russia to Mail.Ru for $100 million in November 2016.
Foodpanda's largest investor Rocket Internet sold the company to Delivery Hero in December 2016. On 1 November 2017, Foodpanda re-branded and changed its brand colour from orange to pink with an updated logo across all served countries, following its acquisition by Delivery Hero.
In April 2018, the company left the Brunei market.
By 2019, Foodpanda had gone through three rounds of management changes.
From 2019 to 2020, Foodpanda began operating in other markets in Southeast Asia, launching in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos. Foodpanda was also launched in Japan in September 2020.
In May 2021, Foodpanda's brand was acquired by Glovo in Bulgaria and Romania. In September 2021, Delivery Hero unified its subsidiary brand NetPincér with Foodpanda in Hungary, with NetPincér rebranding as Foodpanda. In December 2021, Foodpanda stopped its food delivery services in all cities of Germany, except central Berlin.
Since 2021, Foodpanda has partnered with home chefs through an initiative called Home Chefs. The initiative began in Pakistan after the company noticed that there are a lot of female home chefs looking for side income, but it has since scaled to Bangladesh and Malaysia. The initiative is also seen as a source of income for chefs who do not have the capital to set up shop, but have the ability to cook and provide food from their own kitchens. The initiative currently supports 8,000 to 9,000 home chefs, and Foodpanda plans to grow the initiative to support up to 100,000 home chefs.
In early 2022, Foodpanda announced its new mascot called Pau-Pau, an anthropomorphic panda that cares about empowerment and environment. The new mascot will be rolled out across all of Asia.
Foodpanda India
In early 2015, the company made an all-stock purchase of TastyKhana.in, and the portal Just Eat India. Towards the end of 2015, the company laid off around 300 employees in India. During that time, there was allegedly malpractice at Foodpanda India, including non-payments to restaurants and fake listings. The company was based in Gurgaon at the time and was operating in approximately 200 cities. By 2016, Rocket India was seeking a buyer for the company, proposing relatively low prices such as $10 to $15 million.
Foodpanda's business in India was acquired by Ola through an all-share deal on 11 December 2017, at a valuation of $40 to $50 million. Ola said it would invest around $200 million in additional funds into Foodpanda. The company began offering discounts to increase usage, and at its peak, in August 2018, it had around 200,000 daily orders. That dropped to around 5,000 daily orders by mid-2019. Ola suspended Foodpanda India's food delivery business in the middle of 2019 and fired most of its food delivery executives. The Foodpanda brand was said to continue with in-house brands or cloud kitchens. The cloud kitchen concept was adopted by the company after it acquired the company Holachef in October 2018. In 2019, however, it only had three private label brands under its cloud kitchen business, including FLRT and Great Khichdi Experiment.
Operations
Foodpanda is operating in 12 markets in Asia and four markets in Europe, including:
Europe
Germany
Hungary
Slovakia

Laos
Malaysia

Platform
Foodpanda processes and sends orders to partner restaurants, and commissions riders to deliver the food to the customers. The service is available via its websites and mobile applications.
Foodpanda connects customers with restaurants that offer food delivery in their vicinity. Customers can browse the menus of available restaurants, send in food orders, and make payment after providing an address to deliver to. An SMS is sent to confirm the customers' orders and indicate the estimated delivery time.
Foodpanda also has a review section on restaurant pages, where customers can comment on sales process, delivery, taste, and overall impression of the partnering restaurants.
Investments
Foodpanda raised $20 million in initial funding from Investment AB Kinnevik, Phenomen Ventures and Rocket Internet in April 2013. In September 2013, iMENA Holdings invested $8 million. In February 2014, there was another funding round of $20 million from a group of investors, including Phenomen Ventures.
On 11 August 2014, the company announced that it has collected another $60 million in financing from a group of investors.
In March 2015, the company announced it has raised over $110 million from Rocket Internet, as well as other investors. Less than two months later, a group of investors, including Goldman Sachs, invested over $100 million in Foodpanda.
In December 2016, Delivery Hero acquired Foodpanda in full for an undisclosed price.
Controversies
In August 2020, Thai pro-democracy protesters launched a boycott against Foodpanda after it was identified as an advertiser on Nation TV, a pro-establishment mouthpiece. The boycott forced the company to suspend all of its advertisements on the channel amid concerns for its reputation.
In July 2021, the company suffered another widespread boycott in Thailand after it tweeted that it would dismiss one of its drivers who was seen at the place where a royal portrait was set on fire during a pro-democracy protest on 18July, saying his act breached its policy against "terrorism". It was reported that around two million users in Thailand deleted their accounts on the Foodpanda application overnight. Many restaurants also joined the boycott, announcing their withdrawal from their partnerships with Foodpanda. The company later apologised, stating that it supports free speech and would not dismiss the driver.
In July 2021, the company experienced protests in the Philippines over alleged unfair wage policies for its riders. Shortly before the protests started, at least 30 of its riders were reportedly suspended for 10 years. The company apologised for the suspensions, claiming that the occurrence was caused by technical glitches in the riders' software.
In October 2021, the company in Malaysia received backlash after several of its vendors claimed that the service charges them excessively high commission rates as well as other hidden fees. Some vendors terminated their accounts with the service after a revelation of more than 70 screenshots of Facebook posts and pictures of invoices from Foodpanda vendors who claimed that they were being charged a hidden fee which resulted in a zero return on sales.
In November 2021, some Foodpanda workers in Hong Kong went on strike, denouncing exaggerated monthly income promises and other problems.

USS Sea Otter II was a ship of the United States Navy during World War II. Launched on 23 August 1941 by the Levingston Shipbuilding in Orange, Texas., sponsored by Mrs. Eads Johnson, wife of the designer, she was acquired by the US Navy on 26 September 1941 and placed in service on 26 October 1941.
Service history
Sea Otter II proceeded to the Charleston Navy Yard on 26 October 1941, arriving on 2 November. After completion of voyage repairs, Sea Otter II got underway for sea trials on 4 November.
Constructed during the height of enemy submarine attacks along the Atlantic coast, Sea Otter II was designed to allow torpedoes to pass beneath her shallow draft. The draft, however, proved to be almost twice the amount expected, and her 16 unmuffled gasoline engines would be noisy enough to alert any submarine in the area.
Consequently, Sea Otter II, like her predecessor, the 80-foot shallow draft , was destined for little use. She remained at Charleston until being placed out of service on 28 May 1942. On 26 June, she was transferred to the War Shipping Administration, subsequently transferred to Cargoes Incorporated, and struck from the Navy list on 8 May 1946.

Haripuñjaya (Central and Northern Thai: , also spelled Haribhuñjaya) was a Mon kingdom in what is now Northern Thailand, existing from the 7th or 8th to 13th century CE. Its capital was at Lamphun, which at the time was also called Haripuñjaya. In 1292 the city was besieged and captured by Mangrai of the Tai kingdom of Lan Na.
Founding
According to the Camadevivamsa and "Jinakalamali" chronicles, the city was founded by a hermit named Suthep in 629 AD, and the Mon ruler of Lavo Kingdom (present-day Lopburi) sent his daughter Jamadevi to become its first queen. However, this date is now considered as too early, and the actual beginning is placed at around 750 AD. At that time, most of what is now central Thailand was under the rule of various Mon city states, known collectively as the Dvaravati kingdom. Queen Jamadevi gave birth to twins, the older succeeding her as the ruler of Lamphun, and the younger becoming ruler of neighboring Lampang.
Flourishing and downfall
The kingdom under King Adityaraja, came into conflict with the Khmers in the twelfth century. Lamphun inscriptions from 1213, 1218, and 1219, mention King Sabbadhisiddhi endowing Buddhist monuments.
The chronicles say that the Khmer unsuccessfully besieged Haripuñjaya several times during the 11th century. It is not clear if the chronicles describe actual or legendary events, but the other Dvaravati Mon kingdoms did in fact fall to the Khmers at this time. The early 13th century was a golden time for Haripuñjaya, as the chronicles talk only about religious activities or constructing buildings, not about wars. Nevertheless, Haripuñjaya was besieged in 1292 by the Tai Yuan king Mangrai, who incorporated it into his Lan Na ("One Million Rice Fields") kingdom. The plan set up by Mangrai to overpower Haripuñjaya began by dispatching Ai Fa () on an espionage mission to create chaos in Haripuñjaya. Ai Fa managed to spread discontent among the population, which weakened Haripuñjaya and made it possible for Mangrai to take the kingdom over. Phraya Yi Ba, the last king of Haripuñjaya, was forced to flee south to Lampang.

Neatham is a Roman hamlet in the civil parish of Alton in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire, England. Its nearest town is Alton,(where the 2011 Census population was included) which lies south-west from the hamlet.
History
Roman period – Vindomis
The lost Roman settlement of Vindomis is believed to be at Neatham. Its strategic importance lay in its being at the crossing of important roads: one from Winchester towards London and the other from Chichester to Silchester, a large Roman town to the north of present-day Basingstoke. The name Vindomis might be translated as ‘(The mansio) of the wine country' (although this may equally be a Celtic name, with the prefix VINDO-'white'). Vindomis may well have been the administrative centre of a large estate associated with the potteries. The population at this time is estimated at have been 2,500.
Saxon period – Neatham
After the Romans left, it became a Saxon settlement, called Neatham, indicating the presence of a cattle market. For several centuries, Neatham remained the chief place in the area and the focal point of Neatham A Hundred, which included a large part of north-east Hampshire.
Norman period
At the time of the Domesday Book in 1085, Neatham was recorded as belonging to the Crown and it included 96 households. Neatham Hundred included 24 other places. After the founding of Waverley Abbey in 1128, King Steven made a gift of Neatham for the Abbey to establish a Grange and an Oratory, with a community of 12 monks, independent of the parish of Holybourne. Eventually, Neatham was eclipsed by Alton and, in the 12th century, the area was renamed the Alton A Hundred.
Tudor period
When Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries, Neatham went into lay hands and became part of the parish of Binsted.
Modern day
In the 1980s, Neatham elected to be joined to Holybourne. Neatham is now a hamlet comprising a Manor House, a Grange, a mill, and a dozen cottages. Today, the hamlet lies along the Alton bypass between Alton and Farnham. Its Grade I buildings and mills still remain.

The International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (BUNKER) is an International treaty listed and administered by the International Maritime Organization, signed in London on and in force generally on . The purpose is to adopt uniform international rules and procedures for determining questions of liability and providing adequate compensation.
In the convention, Bunker Oil is fuel used to power the ship. The convention covers leakage of that oil, and requires signatories to the convention to have their ships appropriately insured against such leakages.
It is associated with and references:
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (CLC [Convention])
International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (HNS Convention)
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL)
While BUNKER is apparently similar to CLC Convention – they are substantially different. Unlike the CLC, the BUNKER Convention is not limited to persistent fuel oils and will apply to any hydrocarbon used to operate the ship.
State parties
While the convention has been widely adopted, notable exceptions include Bolivia and Honduras — which are generally flag of convenience states—have not ratified the treaty. As with the CLC, the United States of America was a driver behind the BUNKER convention, and had legislation in place similar to BUNKER provisions, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, hence it claimed, the treaty did not need to be signed.
As of November 2018, the treaty has been ratified by 90 states.

The 1867 Settlement Historic District is an historic district in Texas City, Galveston, Texas.
History
Several freedmen were cowboys during the civil war, after the war worked the Butler Ranch, and earned money on the Chisholm Trail. They bought land from William Jones, and founded a freedman's neighborhood.
The first settlers were Kneeland and Slyvia Britton, and Albert and Priscilla (Britton) Phillips. Calvin Bell, Thomas Britton and David Hobgood were area Cowboys and pioneers of the community. By 1870, the Rev. Israel S. Campbell helped begin a church; residents built a sanctuary and school the following year.
The community prospered throughout the late 1800s. Also, the community had a high literacy rate. By the early 1900s residents worked in railroad occupations and later in industry. In 1911, an interurban line came through the community, and Highland Station opened; the Settlement was known as Highlands and La Marque until it was incorporated into the city limits of Texas City in the 1950s. The community began to decline in the 1960s, when many young people left to work in an integrated society. However, rodeos and trail rides have been held as reminders of this once flourishing and self-sufficient community founded by African American Cowboys.
The 1887 Bell home is now a community museum.

Aradhna Krishna is an American academic focused on marketing. As of 2006, she was considered one of the 50 most productive marketing professors in the world. Harvard Business Review recently acknowledged her as "the foremost expert in the field" of sensory marketing.
She is the Dwight F. Benton Professor of Marketing at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. She was awarded as a fellow of the Society for Consumer Psychology, the organization's highest honor, in recognition of her contributions to consumer psychology.
Contributions to marketing
Krishna organized the first academic conference on sensory marketing' (in 2008), bringing together psychologists, neuroscientists, marketing academics and practitioners. She defines sensory marketing as "marketing that engages the consumers' senses and affects their perception, judgment and behavior (and suggests that) from a managerial perspective, sensory marketing can be used to create subconscious triggers that characterize consumer perceptions of abstract notions of the product (e.g., its sophistication or quality)".
In more than fifty published articles, Krishna has explored ways in which a product's look, feel, taste, sound, and smell contribute to how it is perceived, and how people respond to it. Illustrating her research, she also edited and contributed to the book, Sensory Marketing: Research on the Sensuality of Products, in 2009. She also runs an international sensory marketing research laboratory.
In 2013, she published a book, Customer Sense: How the 5 Senses Influence Buying Behavior, which Kirkus Reviews calls "A sophisticated, easy-handed elucidation of the practice of marketing to our senses".
Some important concepts introduced by Krishna's work are perceived consumption, guiltless gluttony, and Smellizing. Raghubir and Krishna (1999) show that container shapes can impact perceived consumption, which is how much consumers think they have eaten or drunk as opposed to how much they have actually eaten or drunk.
Aydinoglu and Krishna (2011) show that food size labels (e.g., a large size portion of french fries being labeled medium) can result in believing that one has not eaten too much and thus not feeling guilty about it (guiltless gluttony).
Smellizing is a term coined by Krishna (Krishna, Morrin and Sayin 2014) to reflect "imagining smells". Krishna, Morrin and Sayin (2014) show that smellizing foods can result in similar physiological responses (salivation) as real smells, when a picture of the food is also available.
Besides sensory marketing, she works on designing winning cause marketing and corporate social responsibility programs, and on constructing engaging pricing and promotion policies.

Pomona Unified School District or PUSD serves approximately 30,000 Pre-K-12 students and 17,000 adult learners at 44 schools in Pomona and Diamond Bar, California. It is located 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, and is the third-largest school district in Los Angeles County.
In 1995 the school district bought the former Indian Hill Mall, a failing shopping center built in the 1960s, and redeveloped it into an educational, commercial and retail complex called The Village at Indian Hill.
In November 2008, 75% of voters approved Measure PS, a $235 million school bond measure, to provide for the renovation of schools. The first of the Measure PS projects were completed in summer 2009. Another round of projects was set for summer 2010, at 21 schools.

Sicalis is a genus of birds in the tanager family Thraupidae. Sometimes classified in the bunting and American sparrow family Emberizidae, more recent studies have shown it to belong in the Thraupidae.
Taxonomy and species list
The genus Sicalis was introduced in 1828 by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie. The name is from the Ancient Greek σικαλίς/sikalis, a small, black-headed bird, mentioned by Epicharmus, Aristotle, and other authors. It was perhaps a warbler in the genus Sylvia. The type species is the saffron finch. The genus now contains 13 species.

Beeston bus station was a former bus station that served the town of Beeston, in the English county of Nottinghamshire. It was closed on 12 July 2015, when it was superseded by the nearby Beeston transport interchange, which includes services on the newly opened Nottingham Express Transit line 1 between Nottingham and Chilwell, as well as the bus routes that previously used the bus station.
The bus station was in the town centre just off Station Road and consisted of six stands in total. The main operator's using the bus station were Nottingham City Transport, Trent Barton, Premiere Travel and YourBus. The bus station was at the heart of the town and over recent years Nottinghamshire County Council funds were spent upgrading the site.

Elmer Ellsworth McMeen, III (known as El McMeen) (born June 3, 1947 in Lewistown, Pennsylvania), is an acoustic steel-string fingerstyle guitarist. His specialty is fingerstyle arrangements of sung or strongly melodic pieces, ranging from the Irish genre, to hymns, gospel tunes and pop music. He has also composed instrumentals for guitar, and has published a book of Irish and Scottish instrumental music that he arranged for classical string trio (violin, viola and cello). That book is called Celtic Treasures for String Trio (Piney Ridge, 2005). He plays and arranges guitar music almost exclusively in the CGDGAD tuning. (That tuning, developed by English guitarist Dave Evans in the 1960s, is similar to a Hawaiian slack-key tuning [CGCGAD] called "C Ni'ihau" tuning.) Acoustic Guitar magazine (Oct. 2001, No. 106) called McMeen "the king of CGDGAD tuning".
McMeen has also arranged many pieces of music in Dropped D tuning (DADGBE), and has written The Art of Dropped D Guitar, published by Mel Bay Publications, Inc. He is profiled in Marquis' Who's Who in the World.
McMeen practiced law as his primary vocation in New York City for many years, and was a partner in the New York City law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, LLP for 21 years, until his retirement in 2000. After retirement from law, he has pursued music and Christian ministry work full-time.
Biography
El McMeen was born in Lewistown, Pennsylvania in 1947, and moved with his family to Huntingdon, PA in 1960. Through freshman year in college, he played clarinet as a solo instrument, as well as in band and orchestra settings. He studied piano, and sang in choral groups. He attended public schools in Lewistown and Huntingdon, PA, before attending Mt. Hermon School (now called Northfield Mt. Hermon School), graduating in 1965. He graduated from Harvard College in 1969, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1972, in each case with Honors. He was an Editor of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review. He has been married to the former Sheila Taenzler since 1971, and has three sons—Jonathan, Daniel and James—and a daughter, Mary.
McMeen started learning guitar as a senior at Mt. Hermon. At first, he did not approach the guitar primarily as a solo instrument, but used it as accompaniment for his singing. Upon reapplying himself in the early 1980s to the instrument, he encountered what he saw as an incredible breadth of music that one could try to render on guitar. He found himself attracted to Irish and Scottish music, alternative tunings, and different approaches to rendering and arranging music. McMeen's playing is characterized by melodic emphasis, economy and great beauty of sound. His natural voice-like phrasing and skill at ornamentation and improvisation create a musical flow that gives the listener the impression he is hearing the piece for the first time, each time it is played. His improvisational approach to pieces creates an atmosphere of warm and personal immediacy. Guitar Player Magazine (Vol. 29, No. 2, 1995) referred to his music as "drop-dead gorgeous".

Molagoottal (; ) is a South Indian stew with coconut and lentils as a base. It is a dish unique to the Nairs and Iyers of Kerala.
It is eaten mixed with rice. It substitutes for sambar or other curry. It is different from sambar and other similar dishes in that it is less spicy and does not contain tamarind. Typical vegetables used in making molagoottal are winter melon (white pumpkin), drumstick, squash, cucumbers, sprouted pulses, yams, root vegetables, spinach and green leaves. Nowadays, molagoottal has been adapted to include Western vegetables such as carrots, cabbage and potatoes.
Molagoottal is similar in preparation and texture to the Tamil dish koottu, the difference being that the latter is thicker and uses Bengal gram.

Shinique Smith (born January 9, 1971) is an American visual artist, known for her colorful installation art and paintings that incorporate found textiles and collage materials. She is based in Brooklyn, New York.
Early life and education
Born in 1971, in Baltimore, Maryland, Smith's artistic training began in childhood, encouraged toward the creative arts by her mother, a fashion editor. She began studying ballet at age four, and later attended the Baltimore School for the Arts.
In high school, Smith was influenced by artists in the Baltimore graffiti scene, an aesthetic also visible in her mature work. Her studies of Japanese calligraphy and abstraction in college also influenced her artistic development.
After earning her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at Maryland Institute College of Art, Smith worked as a costumer and props assistant on movies such as Disclosure, Guarding Tess, Serial Mom, and That Night. From 1995 to 2000, Smith served on the advisory board of 911 Media Arts Center in Seattle, where she launched Seattle's first festival of African American film and video called Flav'a Fest. Described in the press as "an annual journey through the visions, lives and dreams of media makers of African ancestry," the festival hosted films by emerging and established filmmakers such as Cheryl Dunye, Cauleen Smith, Barbara McCullough, Kasi Lemmons, and Charles Burnett (who was honored by Flav'a Fest and Seattle Mayor Norm Rice at a special screening of Killer of Sheep in 1997).
After working in the film industry, Smith returned to her studies and earned a Master of Arts degree in education from Tufts University in 2000 and a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2003. In 2003, Smith moved to New York and participated in The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's artist studio residency, where she began making sculpture.
Art and career
Shinique Smith combines fine art media with text, bright colors, and found objects, such as stuffed animals and clothing. She began to include used clothing in her work after reading a New York Times Magazine article about secondhand garments shipped to Africa from thrift stores. She describes her process as a personal one: "It all begins with emotion, an expression and I allow myself to go on a journey in the making of each work, a journey of associations between object and color, between lyrics and fabric, between the viewer and me."
Smith's art has been described as "kaleidoscopic," collecting "the vibrant, carefully collected debris of her life and career" and creating "graceful yet forceful combinations of many different materials and ideas." The Frist Art Museum has interpreted Smith's work as conveying her personal history as well as "a greater sense of cultural concern and connectivity."
Her work gained critical attention when The Studio Museum in Harlem exhibited her first bale sculpture in Frequency in 2005, an exhibition that helped launch the careers of other artists of Smith's generation such as Nick Cave, Kalup Linzy, Xaviera Simmons, and Hank Willis Thomas.
Smith's sculptural works were also prominently featured in the acclaimed launch exhibition of the New Museum, Unmonumental: The Object in the 21st Century, which featured works by Sam Durant, Urs Fischer, Isa Genzken, Elliott Hundley, and Jim Lambie to name a few. Smith's art was featured in 30 Americans, an exhibition of works by African American artists (including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Rashid Johnson, Kerry James Marshall, Lorna Simpson, Mickalene Thomas, Carrie Mae Weems, and Kehinde Wiley among others) in the permanent collection of the Rubell Museum in Miami that has toured extensively since 2009 and been a favored by critics and viewers at many museums across the U.S.
Since these exhibitions, Smith's works have been exhibited at numerous venues internationally, including a recent 2014 survey of her work BRIGHT MATTER at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, where Jen Mergel, Senior Curator of Contemporary Art described the palette of Smith's works in the exhibition and use of found materials as "a product of United States culture especially from the 1980s." Mergel said the exhibition "reflects an essential aspect of Smith's practice: how to visually manifest emotional connection, belief and the resilience of human energy through gestures and materials that shape daily life. Her work is an embodiment of the powerful spectrum of expression that for Smith, leans toward joy.
Also in 2014, Smith was commissioned by The Rose F. Kennedy Greenway in Boston to create a mural for their rotating exhibition wall. Smith's work, Seven Moon Junction was nationally recognized as one of the Best Public Art Projects Annually by Americans for the Arts Public Art Year in Review. The Greenway also commissioned Smith to create an accompanying dance performance video, Gesture III: One Great Turning, a collaboration with Boston-based KAIROS Dance Theater, which was filmed on The Greenway in front Smith's mural.
Awards and collections
Shinique Smith received a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award in 2013, The Maryland Institute College of Art's Alumni Medal of Honor in 2012, and a Joan Mitchell Prize in 2008. Smith's work is included in several prestigious permanent collections, including the Ackland Art Museum, Brooklyn Museum, Denver Art Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Palmer Museum of Art, The Rubell Family Collection, Miami; the Minneapolis Institute of Art; and the Whitney Museum of American Art.
She is represented by David Castillo Gallery, Miami.

Delphine Arnould de Cool, née Fortin (25 December 1830 – 16 January 1921) was a French painter and writer on Limoges porcelain.
Biography
Cool-Fortin was born as the daughter of the painter Paul Fortin in Limoges. She was something of a child prodigy and became a successful painter at a young age, signing works as Delphine Fortin. She married Alexandre de Cool and had two sons born in Limoges, including the painter Gabriel de Cool born in 1854, and a daughter born in Paris after the couple moved there soon afterwards. During this period, she signed works as Delphine de Cool. Her husband was a writer and the couple were both members of the Société des gens de lettres. Madame de Cool became a teacher and a writer on Limoges porcelain, and was head of an "Élisa Lemonnier" school in 1890 when she published her treatise on porcelain in French and English called Traité de peintures vitrifiables sur porcelaine dure et porcelaine tendre sur émail.
After her husband died, she married the sculptor-writer Arthur Arnould in 1890.
She exhibited her work at The Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois, and her treatise was included in the Women's Library, along with a discussion of her miniature works in gouache by her second husband (writing under his pseudonym A. Matthey).
Her painting A Good Cigarette was included in the 1905 book Women Painters of the World.

Columbus is a science laboratory that is part of the International Space Station (ISS) and is the largest single contribution to the ISS made by the European Space Agency (ESA).
Like the Harmony and Tranquility modules, the Columbus laboratory was constructed in Turin, Italy by Thales Alenia Space. The functional equipment and software of the lab was designed by EADS in Bremen, Germany. It was also integrated in Bremen before being flown to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida in an Airbus Beluga. It was launched aboard on February 7, 2008, on flight STS-122. It is designed for ten years of operation. The module is controlled by the Columbus Control Centre, located at the German Space Operations Center, part of the German Aerospace Center in Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich, Germany.
The European Space Agency has spent €1.4 billion (about US$2 billion) on building Columbus, including the experiments it carries and the ground control infrastructure necessary to operate them.
History
The structure used for Columbus is based on the MPLM module built for NASA by Thales Alenia Space. In 2000 the pre-integrated module (structure including harness and tubing) was delivered to Bremen in Germany by the Co-prime contractor Alenia. The final integration and system testing was performed by the overall prime contractor EADS Astrium Space Transportation, after that the initial Payload was integrated and the overall complement checked-out.
On May 27, 2006 Columbus was flown from Bremen, Germany to Kennedy Space Center on board an Airbus Beluga.
The final schedule was much longer than originally planned due to development problems (several caused by the complex responsibility splitting between the Co-prime and the Overall prime contractor) and design changes introduced by ESA but being affordable due to the Shuttle problems delaying the Columbus launch for several years. The main design change was the addition of the External Payload Facility (EPF), which was driven by the different European Payload organizations being more interested in outer space than internal experiments. Also the addition of a terminal for direct communications to/from ground, which could have been used also as back-up for the ISS system, was studied but not implemented for cost reasons.
Construction
ESA chose EADS Astrium Space Transportation as prime contractor for Columbus overall design, verification and integration. The Columbus structure, the micro-meteorite protection system, the active and passive thermal control, the environmental control, the harness and all the related ground support equipment were designed and qualified by Alcatel Alenia Space in Turin, Italy as defined by the PICA – Principle (for definition see History below); the related hardware was pre-integrated and sent as PICA in September 2001 to Bremen. The lab was built and qualified on system level at the EADS Astrium Space Transportation facilities in Bremen, Germany, from where it was sent to NASA.
Launch, berthing and outfitting
In November 2007, Columbus was moved out of the KSC Space Station Processing Facility, and installed into the payload bay of the Atlantis orbiter for launch on ISS assembly flight 1E (STS-122).
STS-122 launch delays
During cryo-filling of the Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen prior to the first launch attempt on December 6, 2007, two of four LH2 ECO sensors failed a test. Mission rules called for at least three of the four sensors to be in working order for a launch attempt to proceed. As a result of the failure, the Launch Director Doug Lyons postponed the launch, initially for 24 hours. This was later revised into a 72-hour delay, resulting in a next launch attempt set for Sunday December 9, 2007. This launch attempt was scrubbed when one of the ECO sensors again failed during fuelling.
The ECO sensors' external connector was changed on the Space Shuttle external tank, causing a two-month delay in the launch. Columbus was finally launched successfully on the third attempt at 2:45pm EST, February 7, 2008.
Berthing
Once at the station, Canadarm2 removed Columbus from the docked shuttle's cargo bay
and attached it to the starboard hatch of Harmony (also known as Node 2),
with the cylinder pointing outwards on February 11, 2008.
Description
The laboratory is a cylindrical module, made from stainless steel, kevlar and hardened aluminum, with two end cones. It is in external diameter and in overall length, excluding the projecting external experiment racks. Its shape is very similar to that of the Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules (MPLMs),
since both were designed to fit in the cargo bay of a Space Shuttle orbiter. The starboard end cone contains most of the laboratory's on-board computers. The port end cone contains the Common Berthing Mechanism.

Research activities and payloads
Activities in the lab are controlled on the ground by the Columbus Control Center (at DLR Oberpfaffenhofen in Germany) and by the associated User Support Operations Centres throughout Europe.
The laboratory can accommodate ten active International Standard Payload Racks (ISPRs) for science payloads.
Agreements with NASA allocate to ESA 51% usage of the Columbus Laboratory.
ESA is thus allocated five active rack locations, with the other five being allocated to NASA.
Four active rack locations are on the forward side of the deck, four on the aft side, and two are in overhead locations.
Three of the deck racks are filled with life support and cooling systems.
The remaining deck rack and the two remaining overhead racks are storage racks.
In addition, four un-pressurized payload platforms can be attached outside the starboard cone, on the Columbus External Payload Facility (CEPF). Each external payload is mounted on an adaptor able to accommodate small instruments and experiments totalling up to .
The following European ISPRs have been initially installed inside Columbus:
Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL)
European Physiology Modules (EPM)
Biolab
European Drawer Rack (EDR)
European Stowage Rack
The first external payloads were mounted on Columbus by crew members of the mission STS-122 mission. The three payloads mounted are:
European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF) platform, which accommodates nine instruments: TRIBOLAB, PLEGPAY, MEDET, EUFIDE, DEBIE-2, FIPEX, EUTEMP, EXPOSE, DOSTEL, and the Earth Viewing Camera.
Solar Monitoring Observatory (SOLAR)
MISSE-6 (NASA payload)
Planned additional external payloads:
Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES)
EXPORT
Atmosphere-Space Interaction Monitor (ASIM)
European Data Relay Satellite (EDRS) Communications Terminal, Ka-band
In 2014 the ISS-RapidScat instrument was installed, which was operated until late 2016. ISS-RapidScat was transported to ISS by the SpaceX CRS-4 spaceflight.

Ethel Browning (born Ethel Bull; April 17, 1877 – September 22, 1965) was an American actress and screenwriter.
Early years
The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. C. Bull, Browning was born in Indianapolis and lived on the South Side of St. Louis, Missouri, until she debuted on stage, after which her family moved to Dayton, Ohio.
Career
Browning debuted on stage in a production of Ye Olden Trouble (1892) in Trenton, New Jersey. After being a child actress with a Broadway acting company headed by Joseph Jefferson, Browning matured to ingenue roles with Nat Goodwin's troupe, including traveling with that group on an Australian tour.
In 1898, Browning acted with the Park Theater Stock Company until a disagreement arose between her and Leonard Grover, the theater's manager. Her husband attempted to take over a role for which he had been rejected, which led to both husband and wife resigning from the company. She sought a warrant in court after Grover offered $58 in settlement pay, far short of the $350 that Browning considered was due them. The magistrate did not issue a warrant, however. A week later, Grover went to court seeking damages from Browning for breach of contract.
Browning's Broadway credits included Meyer & Son (1909) and Marta of the Lowlands (1903 and 1908). Her final appearance on stage came in 1947 in a production of The Gentleman from Athens.
Browning also worked behind the scenes with films. As a screenwriter, she adapted Mabel Wagnalls' short story A Rose Bush of a Thousand Years for filming in addition to arranging the contract for sale of screen rights to the short story and her screenplay. She also adapted works by Florence Morse Kingsley, Leslie Moore, and Meredith Nicholson for filming.
Personal life and death
Browning was married to Ashley Miller, an actor and director of silent films, from 1899 until his death in 1949.
On September 22, 1965, Browning died at Pine Rest Nursing Home in Paramus, New Jersey, at age 88.

Bab al-Hadid () meaning the Iron Gate of Victory, is one of the nine historical gates of the Ancient City of Aleppo, Syria. It is one of the well-preserved gates of old Aleppo.
History
The gate was planned during the reign of Az-Zahir Ghazi and built by his son Mohammed as Bab al-Qanat (the Aqueduct Gate). It was rebuilt by the final Mamluk sultan Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri in 1509.
The gate and surrounding quarters of the old city are some of the best preserved areas in the old city of Aleppo. It was historically known for its blacksmiths and to this day, there are some operating with the same traditional practices, most of whom have had the trade in their family for many generations.
Restoration of the damaged gate began in September 2020 and was completed in 2021.

A speed record is a world record for speed by a person, animal, or vehicle. The function of speed record is to record the speed of moving animate objects such as humans, animals or vehicles.
Overall speed record
Overall speed record is the record for the highest average speed regardless of any criteria, categories or classes that all the more specific records belong to, provided that the route was completed. It helps to compare various performances that differ by the type of the craft, vessel or vehicle, the departure and the arrival points (provided that the distances are comparable), number, age and gender of the crew members, departure date, etc. The distance used for calculating the overall speed record is usually the distance in a straight line. In the case of man-powered races, overall speed record doesn't always reflect the best performance. It is highly dependent on technological advantages generating the speed of the craft, vessel or vehicle.
Term Overall Speed Record is also used to compare the highest momentary speed achieved by a vehicle, vessel or craft in the highest land speed, water speed or air speed contest.

Adolfo Arnoldo Majano Ramos (born 21 April 1938) is a former Salvadoran military and political figure. He was one of the leaders of the military coup on October 15, 1979, and the chairman of the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador from 1979 to 1980.
Biography
Adolfo Arnoldo Majano Ramos was born on 21 April 1938 in the Morazán Department El Salvador. He entered the Salvadoran Escuela Militar Capitán General Gerardo Barrios in 1955 and graduated in 1958 with the rank of junior lieutenant of the infantry. In 1974, he graduated from the General Staff of the Higher Military School in Mexico City. He also studied at the School of the Americas in the Panama Canal Zone, then served in the Salvadoran Army. After serving in the 1st Infantry Brigade, he was promoted to the rank of colonel.
1979 coup and Revolutionary Government Junta
In 1979, Colonel Majano was involved in a military conspiracy to overthrow the regime of Carlos Humberto Romero. After the coup on 15 October 1979, Majano became one of two army representatives in the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador. Majano was considered the most important person in the junta.
On 13 December 1980 at a meeting of the command of the Salvadoran Army, Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte became President of the junta with Colonel Jaime Abdul Gutierrez as vice president. Colonel Majano appointed to be the military attaché to Spain, however, he refused this appointment and accused the junta of supporting right-wing extremists. Colonel Majano resigned as Commander-in-Chief and Chairman of the Revolutionary Government Junta in May 1980 and was replaced with Jaime Abdul Gutiérrez. He resigned from the junta on 13 December 1980.
Arrest, release and exile
On the evening of 15 December, he convened a press conference at which he accused the junta of terrorism and the Christian Democratic Party of conciliation. The junta issued an order for the arrest of Majano, which immediately provoked a protest from the leaders of the Military Youth. The press often reported Majano's intention to join the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front following his arrest warrant being issued. On 20 February 1981, Majano was arrested. He was arrested and imprisoned along with Roberto D'Aubuisson. He was released on 20 March 1981 and went into exile in Panama. When Panamanian President Omar Torrijos died in 1981, he moved to Mexico, and later to Canada in 1983. He returned to El Salvador in 1988 and survived an assassination attempt.
Personal life
Majano currently lives in Canada, is married, and has four children.

Norwich Arts Centre is a live music venue, theatre and art gallery located in St Benedict's Street in Norwich, Norfolk, England. It has a capacity of 260 for standing music concerts and 120 for seated events. In November 2014, it was named "Britain's Best Small Venue" by the NME.
History
In 1976, a group formed for the purpose of starting an alternative venue for the visual and performing arts in Norwich. With the help of Norwich City Council the venue was opened in 1977 in a former carpet factory on St Benedicts Street and named "Premises". It moved to its current site, St Swithin's Church, in 1980 and has remained there since. The centre currently operates as a registered charity.
Although a small venue, Norwich Arts Centre has hosted many well known bands and comedians, including Nirvana, Oasis, Muse, The Stone Roses, Manic Street Preachers, The Libertines, Coldplay, Enter Shikari, Biffy Clyro, Foals Kasabian, Mumford & Sons, Bombay Bicycle Club, Jack Dee, Mark Lamarr, Sue Perkins, Steve Harley (as a 3-man electro-acoustic set), Mark Thomas, Noel Fielding, David Baddiel, Ross Noble, Frank Skinner and Josie Long.
Following a gig on 15 May 1991, Richey Edwards of the Manic Street Preachers carved the words "4 Real" into his forearm with a razor blade following an interview with journalist Steve Lamacq.
St Swithin's Church
The redundant church which houses the Norwich Arts Centre is dedicated to Saint Swithun and dates from 1349, although an earlier, Anglo-Saxon church may have existed on the site.
The area was originally a wealthy one, with four medieval churches close to each other. However it had become a slum by the nineteenth century. St Swithin's became redundant and was closed in 1881. In 1882, the church's tower was demolished as it had become unsafe, this was later replaced by a bell-cot. The building was back in use as a church between 1883 and 1891, after which time it fell into disrepair.
In 1905, a clergyman, John Sawbridge, raised funds for it to be reopened as an Evangelical church, to cater for the poor and deprived surrounding area. There was sufficient money for a large, adjoining parish mission and schoolroom to be constructed in 1908. During the following decades, this building served the local community in a number of ways. During the Second World War, it was the headquarters of the local Home Guard.
By 1951 the church was again redundant due to falling numbers of local residents. In 1954, the church was designated a Grade I Listed building. It was used as a furniture warehouse until it was taken over by the Arts Centre in 1980. The church itself became an auditorium, and the schoolroom became an exhibition space and cafe.
Little of the interior of the church remains in place. During the conversion to an auditorium in the early 1980s it was stripped of its church features. Medieval features in the interior, including two choir-stalls that were recorded by Nikolaus Pevsner, no longer exist. An exception are ten monuments, the oldest being to Sibilla Skottowe (died 1657) and Anne Skottowe (died 1662). Another monument is to William Abbott (1754-1818), a veteran of the American War of Independence, who served at the Battle of Bunker Hill.

This is a list of seasons completed by the Tennessee Titans, an American football franchise of the National Football League (NFL). The list documents the season-by-season records of the Titans' franchise from 1960 to the present, including postseason records and league awards for individual players or head coaches. The Titans were originally known as the Houston Oilers and were a part of the inaugural season of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960. In 1997, the franchise moved to Tennessee, playing in Memphis temporarily until settling in Nashville. The team was rebranded as the Titans following the 1998 season. The Titans have yet to win a Super Bowl, falling one yard short in their only appearance in Super Bowl XXXIV, although the team does have two championships from its early years in the AFL. During their tenure in Tennessee they have defeated all 31 other franchises at least once, enjoying a perfect record against the Detroit Lions (5-0).

Santa Maria (Portuguese for Saint Mary) is a city in the southern part of the island municipality of Sal, Cape Verde. It is located on the south coast, about 16 km south of the Amílcar Cabral International Airport, and 20 km south of the island capital Espargos.
History
Santa Maria was founded in 1830 for the production of salt. Up to 30,000 tons of salt were shipped from Santa Maria each year. A pier was built in the area of Ponta de Vera Cruz and a small rail track was built to carry the salt to the pier. Most of the product was exported to Brazil, which was halted in 1887 when Brazil imposed a high tax on imported salt to protect its own salt production. The town went into a deep decline, only to recover in 1920 when a Portuguese investor resumed salt production. This continued until 1984. In 1935, Santa Maria was elevated from a village to a town.
In 1967, Belgian industrialists and engineers Georges Vynckier and Marguerite Massart opened Cape Verde's first resort hotel named Morabeza. After 1986, tourism became an important industry on the island, and many resorts and hotels were built in the southern and southwestern coastal areas near Santa Maria. In 2017, 48.2% of the country's available beds were on the island of Sal.

Theon to his father Theon, greeting. It was a fine thing of you not to take me with you to the city! If you doesn't take me with you to Alexandria I won't write you a letter or speak to you or say goodbye to you; and if you go to Alexandria I won't take your hand nor ever greet you again. That is what will happen if you won't take me. Mother said to Archelaus, "It quite upsets him to be left behind (?)." It was good of you to send me presents ... on the 12th, the day you sailed. Send me a lyre, I implore you. If you don't, I won't eat, I won't drink; there now!

CM and StP Railroad Underpass is a historic structure located southwest of Washington, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The Warren deck truss bridge is a rare example of this type of bridge in Iowa, and the oldest still in existence. Given the relatively flat nature of Iowa's rivers and streams this bridge type was rarely built in the state, and was mostly built for railroad use. This bridge, completed in 1903 by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad (known as simply The Milwaukee Road), crosses a county highway bridge and the west fork of Crooked Creek.

AE Smith is a commercial air-conditioning and mechanical services contractor in Australia focusing on heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, electrical, controls, fire protection, construction and commissioning. The company employs over 1100 people today and was acquired by Spotless Group in 2015.
History
AE Smith was founded in Richmond, Victoria, Australia in 1898 by Albert Edward Smith (1871–1923). Albert Smith was a qualified plumber. The establishment of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW) in 1891 and Melbourne's first underground sewerage system facilitated considerable growth in the plumbing industry and the success of the company itself.
Albert Edward Smith was succeeded by his son, Albert Edward Smith Junior (or Bert Smith). Bert served the company for over forty years, in which time he extended the services of the business to include heating, ventilation and air-conditioning. This significantly expanded the scope of the business and enabled it to take on larger projects.
Bert Smith's son, Barry Smith, took leadership of the company in 1953, initiating an era which witnessed the expansion of the company across Australia and abroad. By the end of the twentieth century, AE Smith gained significant recognition as a mechanical services company after taking part in many landmark projects involving shopping centres, hotels, universities hospitals in the city of Melbourne. This success resulted in a new branch being opened in Hobart in 1967, followed by offices in Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sydney, Mackay, Townsville, Perth and abroad in Auckland, New Zealand. In February 2015 Spotless Group Holdings acquired AE Smith in order to strengthen their capabilities in air-conditioning and mechanical services.

Conradus Leemans was born in 1809 in Zalt-Bommel, Netherlands, and was the eldest son of physician Dr. Willem Leemans and Hillegonda Rachel Ganderheijden. His parents moved to Leiden, Netherlands, in 1821.
Education
Leemans enrolled at Leiden University in 1826 to study theology, but changed to archaeology in 1828 apparently after meeting with Caspar Reuvens.
Leiden Museum
In 1834 he was employed at the Leiden Museum and while there became successor to Reuvens as Director, during 1839. He continued in this capacity until sometime during 1891. Leemans organised the first public display of collections of acquisitions made by Reuvens, compiled a catalogue of Egyptian objects (Catalogue raisonnée, 1840), and edited the serial publication of the Monumens égyptiens, this being a lithographic account detailing the collection.
Leemans studied the Leiden papyrus while Director of the museum, completing the work begun by Reuvens on this. But while executing the task, Leemans at some time added to the papyri a form of vegetable paper, which was added by him in order to preserve the artifact. Either the paper or glue used to affix the paper has degraded causing some of the writing to become obscured, and Leemans's addition is thought to be fixed permanently, since otherwise too great damage would be done to the artifact in its removal.
Leemans became member of the Royal Institute, predecessor to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, in 1840. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1886.

The parliamentary snuff box is a wooden snuff box at the door of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom where snuff is stored for use by Members of Parliament. It originated after 1694 when smoking was banned in the House of Commons. It is the responsibility of the Principal Doorkeeper to ensure it is kept stocked.
History
In 1694, the Parliament of England passed a resolution banning smoking in the House of Commons chamber and in committee rooms. Following this, members still wished to take tobacco so snuff was used as a tolerated alternative to smoking as attributed to Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice. In 1941, the House of Commons chamber was destroyed by a German bomb on the Palace of Westminster. The current parliamentary snuff box was created using timber from the destroyed chamber's door frame with a silver plate listing all the names of the Principal Doorkeepers since 1943 screwed onto the lid. The responsibility for maintaining the parliamentary snuff box lies with the Principal Doorkeeper who stocks the box with snuff paid for with his own money.
Attention
Until the 2010s, the rights of MPs to have free snuff was a little known tradition of the House of Commons. Freedom of Information request in 2010 confirmed the existence of the tradition and that it was filled with snuff chosen by the Principal Doorkeeper which he selected from a local tobacconist. The request did not reveal which members took advantage of the free snuff privilege as the last recorded instance of an MP taking snuff was in 1989 when was taken at a cost of 99p.
In 2012, the parliamentary snuff box was mentioned in a debate by the Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Caroline Lucas who criticised the parliamentary snuff box for being outdated. The Conservative Party MP for Gillingham and Rainham, Rehman Chishti, also wrote a written question about how much had been used in the previous decade. The response was that there were no known users of the parliamentary snuff box. It was also noted that while under the Health Act 2006 it is illegal to give out free tobacco in the United Kingdom, Parliament is exempt from this as the Palace of Westminster is a royal palace and therefore legally exempt from the legislation.

Landenberg Castle is a ruined castle atop a hill in the municipality of Sarnen in the canton of Obwalden in Switzerland. In the 18th century an armory and firing range were built on the site. The Landenberg Armory is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. The ruins of the castle was the meeting place of the Landsgemeinde or Cantonal assembly for over three centuries.
History
The castle was originally known as Sarnen Castle or simply Sarnen. Landenberg first appears in records in the 17th century.
The earliest fortifications on Landenberg hill probably date back to the early 11th century, when the Counts of Lenzburg built a wooden fort there. After the Lenzburg line died out in 1173 their estates around Sarnen were inherited by the Habsburgs. The Habsburgs built a stone ring wall around much of the crown of the hill. While parts of the wall are still visible, very little is known about the buildings inside the wall. The castle was one of the largest castles in central Switzerland. However, in the early 13th century, the castle was apparently abandoned, for unknown reasons. It is unclear whether the Hexenturm, built in the late 13th century, was part of the Landenberg complex, a replacement to it or simply a nearby castle.
The 15th century White Book of Sarnen contains a story about how in the early 14th century local Swiss patriots stormed a castle and burned it on Christmas Eve while the pro-Habsburg nobleman was attending Mass. Traditionally it was believed that the attack happened to Landenberg Castle, though more recent research indicates that it may have been the Hexenturm.
After the castle was abandoned, the walls were slowly broken up for building material and animals were penned inside. In the early 17th century a drawing of the ruins show that the castle walls still stood. At that time it was owned by Hauptmann Marquard Seiler/Seier. After his death, his widow sold the castle and hill to the Canton of Obwalden. The first armory was built there around 1620 on the site of a medieval tower. In 1646 it was decided that the Landsgemeinde, a yearly assembly of all voters in the Canton, would meet in the Landenberg. To hold these assemblies, the ground was cleared and the walls repaired. It continued to meet at Landenberg until it was dissolved in 1998. During construction of the armory and shooting range, many of the remaining castle walls were demolished or buried. During an 1895 renovation of the Landsgemeinde plaza, the old walls were excavated and repaired.
The current armory building was built in 1711 and required demolishing a medieval tower on the south-west corner to open up space. The Baroque building was built by Hans Josef von Flüe. The cannons were stored in the large, open ground floor, while the upper floors stored small arms and armor. The armory was used for its military purpose until 1975. Today it is one of the few intact armories in central Switzerland.
A shooting range was built on the hill top in the early 18th century, but was destroyed in a fire in 1747. The current shooting range building was built in 1752 by Johann Anton Singer. The 1752 building has a large three story center with symmetric single story wings each topped with an onion dome capped tower. The upper story of the central features a richly decorated large ballroom or meeting hall.
Castle site
The ruins of the castle walls cover an area of about , making it one of the largest castles in central Switzerland. Today long stretches of low stone walls are still visible. The walls are up to thick. The gate house is on the western wall, but that section of the wall was totally demolished so nothing is known about the gate. The western corner was the highest part of the hill and was guarded by a square tower.
The Zeughaus or armory is on the southern side of the complex, while the Schützenhaus or shooting range building is on the eastern side.

Kevin Guthrie (born 21 March 1988) is a Scottish actor. His best known roles are Ally in Sunshine on Leith (2013) and Ewan Tavendale in Terence Davies's 2015 film Sunset Song. He also performed the lead role in Peter Pan at the King's Theatre, Glasgow, in 2011.
On 16 April 2021, Guthrie was convicted of a sexual assault that occurred in 2017 for which he was sentenced to three years in prison and placed on the Sexual Offenders Register indefinitely. He was freed in May 2022 after his sentence was reduced to 2 years on appeal.
Career
Guthrie attended the PACE Youth Theatre in Paisley and appeared in small roles in television and film. He studied at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (then the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama). He left after receiving the title role in the National Theatre of Scotland's production of Peter Pan in 2010, graduating later in 2011 with a BA in Acting.
Alongside theatre work, including a role in 2013's Macbeth starring James McAvoy at Trafalgar Studios, Guthrie had a starring role in 2013's musical drama Sunshine on Leith. He appeared in the pilots of the British sitcoms Two Doors Down (2013) and Miller's Mountain (2014), but both roles were recast when these series were commissioned for a full series. In 2015 he acted in Robert Carlyle's directorial debut The Legend of Barney Thomson and in the role of Ewan Tavendale in Terence Davies's adaptation of the novel Sunset Song, opposite Agyness Deyn.
In 2016 Guthrie appeared in Gillies MacKinnon's remake of the 1949 Ealing Studios classic Whisky Galore!. The film was widely released in the UK in May 2017. Later in the year, he appeared in Christopher Nolan's war epic Dunkirk. In 2020 he portrayed Fergus Suter in the Netflix historical sports drama TV miniseries The English Game.
Following his conviction for sexual assault in April 2021, Guthrie was dropped by BBC Scotland from his role on Inside Central Station, of which he narrated the first two seasons. Shows featuring Guthrie were also removed from the BBC iPlayer.
Sexual assault conviction
In September 2020, Guthrie was charged with sexual assault. A trial before jury was set for January 2021 but was administratively adjourned due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Guthrie remained on bail in the interim. On 16 April 2021, he was convicted following a four-day trial at Glasgow Sheriff Court of carrying out a sexual assault on a woman that took place at the residence of fellow actor Scott Reid in Kelvindale, Glasgow between 30 September and 1 October 2017. On 14 May 2021, he was sentenced to three years in prison and was placed on the sex offenders' register indefinitely. An attempted appeal of his conviction was rejected in November 2021.
Guthrie was released from HM Prison Dumfries in May 2022, having had term reduced to two years following a successful appeal to cut his prison time. He failed, however, in attempting to have his conviction quashed.
Personal life
The son of a nurse and an electrician, Guthrie grew up in Neilston and has two older sisters. He attended St Luke's High School in Barrhead, and later Langside College in Glasgow. He has lived in north London and in Yorkhill, Glasgow.

Murat Brierre or Murat Briere (1938–1988) was one of Haiti's principal metal sculptors and was known for his recycling of surplus oil drum lids. He was influenced by George Liautaud, but his work acquired its own highly experimental style, often focusing on multi-faceted and conjoined figures, fantastically personified elements, and unborn babies visible within larger creatures.
Early life and career
Brierre worked as a brick mason, cabinetmaker, tile setter, and blacksmith. He was born in Mirebalais or Port-au-Prince, Haiti and was the younger of two brothers. His older brother, Edgar Brierre, was a painter and sculptor. The brother's signed their works with only their last name, creating some confusion within their professional circles about the authorship of their work.
Brierre's sculptures typically ranged from three to six feet in length and reflected Christian, Haitian Vodou, and folklore themes. Brierre was also a painter, but ultimately chose to work with metal because he felt that the material was saturated with spiritual energy. It was a laborious process. The oil drum lids were hammered flat, drawn onto, then cut with a razor. The sheet was then cut with a chisel before finishing was completed with a file. By the mid1970s, Brierre's sculptures included pronounced areas of cut outs surrounding long curved lines of metal. Brierre's iron sculpture titled Chien de Mer overlays a dog head onto the body of a fish.

The March 703 was a Formula 3 racing car built by March Engineering in 1970.
Design and development
The Mach 703 was the March 702's sister vehicle. Like the 702 built for Formula 2, the 703 was based on the 1969 693. The car unfortunately was far too heavy for a Formula 3 car and sold poorly.
Racing history
The 703s were used in the British Formula 3 Championship and neither driver was able to achieve a win with them. Only Dave Morgan managed a few podiums with his 703.

RAF Freiston is a former Royal Air Force station located about east of Boston, Lincolnshire, which was in operation during the First World War.
Station history
In mid-1916, the Royal Naval Air Service established RNAS Freiston Shores on the mudflats to the south of Frieston, Lincolnshire, to serve as a bombing and gunnery range for trainee pilots of the RNAS Flying School at Cranwell. As aircraft using the range had to fly for 40 minutes from Cranwell, in September 1916 about of farmland nearby were requisitioned to serve as a landing ground. As training continued, the landing ground was enlarged with hangars, accommodation, and a control tower. As well as its training role, it also became home to a flight of Bristol Scouts based there on anti-Zeppelin operations. On 1 April 1918 the Royal Naval Air Service was merged with the Army's Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force, and it was renamed RAF Freiston, designated the School of Aerial Fighting and Bomb Dropping, and later renamed No. 4 School of Aerial Fighting, and then No. 4 Fighting School, to train pilots in air gunnery and bomb dropping operations. The station was closed in early 1919, and soon after several buildings were destroyed in a severe gale. The only remains still extant are the foundations of the headquarters building.
St. James' church in nearby Freiston village contains nine Commonwealth War Graves, three of whom were Canadians serving with the RAF, who were killed in flying accidents during training at RAF Freiston.

William Kirkpatrick Riland Bedford (1826–1905) was an English clergyman and author, known as an antiquary and genealogist, and also as a cricketer.
Life
Born at Sutton Coldfield rectory on 12 July 1826, he was eldest of five sons of William Riland Bedford the rector, by his wife Grace Campbell, daughter of Charles Sharpe of Hoddam, Dumfriesshire; Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe was his mother's brother. After education at Sutton Coldfield grammar school, Bedford won a Queen's scholarship at Westminster School in 1840, and qualified for a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford. An attack of scarlet fever made him miss that chance, and on 6 June 1844 he matriculated as a commoner at Brasenose College. In 1847 he was secretary of the Oxford Union Society when Lord Dufferin was president. He graduated B.A. in 1848 and proceeded M.A. in 1852.
In 1849 Bedford was ordained to the curacy of Southwell, Nottinghamshire, and in 1850 he succeeded his uncle, Dr. Williamson, as rector of Sutton Coldfield. He held the post for 42 years, and was rural dean for 25. He commissioned the house that eventually became the core of Good Hope Hospital for his son, W.C. Riland Bedford.
Bedford died at Cricklewood on 23 January 1905; his ashes were buried after cremation at Golders Green.
Works
Bedford wrote on the antiquities of Sutton Coldfield in Three Hundred Years of a Family Living, being a History of the Rilands of Sutton Coldfield (1889), and The Manor of Sutton, Feudal and Municipal (1901). He was a frequent contributor to Notes and Queries. From 1878 to 1902 he was chaplain of the order of St. John of Jerusalem, and in his capacity of official genealogist he compiled works dealing with the history and regulations of the Knights Hospitallers, including Malta and the Knights (1870; 2nd edit. 1894), Notes on the Old Hospitals of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem (1881), and a history of the English Hospitallers (1902) in collaboration with R. Holbeche.
Other publications were: a Memoir of Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, his uncle, written from family papers (1888); The Blazon of Episcopacy (1858; 2nd edit. 1897); and Outcomes of Old Oxford (1899).
Sport
Bedford was a keen cricketer in the early days of the game. On 20 July 1856 he founded the Free Foresters, an amateur wandering club with headquarters at Sutton Coldfield, and he recorded the fortunes of the club in his Annals of the Free Foresters from 1856 (1895). He was also an archer, and attended the meetings of the Woodmen of Arden at Meriden, Warwickshire, winning the Arden medal on 16 July 1857. In 1885 he published Records of the Woodmen of Arden from 1785, and contributed to the volume Archery in the Badminton series (1894).
Family
Bedford married:
on 18 September 1851, Maria Amy, the youngest daughter of Joseph Houson (died 1890) of Southwell, Nottinghamshire;
in 1900, Margaret, daughter of Denis Browne.
There were seven sons and three daughters of the first marriage.

The General George Crook House Museum is located in Fort Omaha. The Fort is located in the Miller Park neighborhood of North Omaha, Nebraska, United States. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969, and is a contributing property to the Fort Omaha Historic District.
History
In 1878, General George Crook moved headquarters for the Department of the Platte from downtown Omaha to Fort Omaha. The General Crook home was built in 1879 to be the residence of the commander. Constructed in an Italianate design, the building consists of two stories with a grand garden surrounding it. Crowned by hipped roofs, the building is asymmetrical in plan and is in good condition. A long one-story porch projects from its eastern facade.
General George Crook was the only commander to occupy the home, as the department was disbanded after his tenure. In November, 1879, Crook and his wife entertained General and Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant at the home. In September 1880, President Rutherford B. Hayes stayed there while he was reviewing the troops at the Fort.
After Crook left Fort Omaha, the house served as a home to each of the subsequent commanders of the Fort. In 1905, the house was used as an officer's club and mess hall. In 1930, it was converted back to a post commander's residence, serving until the Fort was closed in 1973.
The Crook House is the oldest structure built as a private residence in Omaha.
The building was named a Nebraska State Historical Site in 1970.
Currently
The Douglas County Historical Society restored the house in the 1980s, refurbishing it with period furniture and restoring its heirloom Victorian gardens. Today, it is open to the public for tours and for special events.

Aspects of the Novel is a book compiled from a series of lectures delivered by E. M. Forster at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1927, in which he discussed the English language novel. By using examples from classic texts, he highlights the seven universal aspects of the novel: story, characters, plot, fantasy, prophecy, pattern, and rhythm.
Some critics have taken issue with the fact that Forster, as a renowned novelist, formulated a normative theory of how to write prose. W. Somerset Maugham commented that, having read the book, "I learned that the only way to write novels was like Mr. E. M. Forster." Virginia Woolf, reviewing Aspects of the Novel in Nation and Athenaeum, on the other hand, praised some aspects of the book. According to Woolf, Forster, unlike other male critics, never exercises stern authority to save the lady (i.e. fiction), he merely acts as a casual friend who happens to have been admitted into the bedroom. Woolf concedes, however, that this is ultimately not very helpful when it comes to formulating rules: "So then we are back in the old bog; nobody knows anything about the laws of fiction".

Leggo is a ghost town in Yalobusha County, Mississippi, United States.
The settlement was located about south of Enid Lake, and west of Water Valley.
Leggo gained fame due to a mineral well located nearby.
History
W.B. Ford moved from South Carolina to Mississippi after the Civil War. Ford dug a well to supply water to his livestock, but his cattle would not drink it due to its high mineral content. The water from "Ford's Well" was believed to have medicinal properties, and the community of Leggo developed a short distance south of the well.
Leggo flourished as a health resort, and many people would visit Leggo annually to use Ford's water. Ford also sold his water throughout the southeastern United States.
Leggo had a school, a post office, and an excellent hotel.
Leggo today is covered by forest. The Ford's Well Church and Cemetery are located north of the former settlement.

Ikatan Pandu Indonesia (Ipindo) was the World Organization of the Scout Movement-recognized Indonesian national Scouting federation from 1953 to 1961.
When Indonesia became an independent country, there were more than 60 separate Boy Scout and Girl Guide organizations. Most were directly affiliated with some certain political parties or social groups. Attempts were made to unify all Scout organizations into one. The fact that Indonesia is made up of many islands made administration and supervision difficult, and the Japanese occupation caused some twenty separate Scout organizations to spring up, so it took time for them to coalesce. In September 1951 thirteen of the stronger Scout and Guide organizations nationwide met and decided to found a federating body to satisfy national and international needs.
Ipindo's motto was "Sedia", meaning "Be Prepared" in English. Tuan Soemardjo was elected chief commissioner, and Dr. Bahder Djohan, an old Scout and Minister of Education, became honorary President. Government approval of Ipindo was granted on February 22, 1952, and President Sukarno consented to become patron of the unifying and correlating National Scout Council. Soon, other Scout and Guide organizations began to merge into Ipindo.
With the 1961 decision to absorb the Fadjar Harapan Pioneer movement organization (founded in 1959), the establishment of a single Scout Movement organization in Indonesia called Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia was officially complete. In May 1961, the then President of Indonesia, Sukarno, signed a presidential regulation making Gerakan Pramuka the official Scout and Guide organization in Indonesia.

Catherine of Alexandria is a tempera painting created by Ieremias Palladas. Palladas was a monk associated with Saint Catherine's sacred monastery in Egypt also known as Mount Sinai. He was a painter and teacher. His nephew became the Patriarch of Alexandria. His name was Gerasimos Palladas. Ieremias was a Sinaitic monk because of his association with Saint Catherine's monastery on Mount Sinai. The monastery is at the location where Moses received his tablets. Ieremias was one of the most influential figures of his time. The Patriarch of Jerusalem Nectarius wrote about the painter in his archives.
Saint Catherine was an educated woman and princess from Alexandria, Egypt. She was alive from 287 to 305. She died seven years before Constantine recognized the new Christian religion. She was tortured by Emperor Maxentius because she converted hundreds of people to the new Christian faith. She was almost put to death by a spiked wheel. She is often depicted in art as an educated woman with a spiked wheel. Palladas finished one of the most influential paintings of the figure for the iconostasis of Saint Catherine's Monastery in Mount Sinai, Egypt. It became the prototype for Catherine of Alexandria. During the same period, another Sinaitic monk named Theocharis Silvestros painted several versions of the prototype. Countless artists copied the work namely, Emmanuel Lambardos, Victor and Philotheos Skoufos.
Description
The materials used were egg tempera on gold leaf and wood panel. The height is 158.7 cm (62.2 in) and the width is 117.8 cm (46.4 in). The painting is over 5 feet tall, it was completed in 1612. It was part of a large group of paintings completed for the iconostasis of Saint Catherine's Monastery in Mount Sinai, Egypt. The icon features Catherine of Alexandria. The princess sits in a position similar to Palladas's earlier work depicting Saint Catherine. The artist created an advanced version of his earlier work.
Palladas integrates Michael Damaskinos's Virgin of the Burning Bush in the middle ground. The artist clearly attempts to escape the traditional maniera greca and incorporates the prevalent Cretan style. The painting exhibits deeper space and enhanced three-dimensionality. The artist clearly superimposes Damaskinos's work in the background. The mountains are painted in the traditional Cretan style. The mountains are Jebel Mousa featuring Moses and Theotokos as the burning bush and Jebel Katrin with the tomb of Saint Catherine accompanied by two angels. The gilded background fits into the three-dimensional space. The artist also creates a natural scene with green valleys.
Palladas aimed to construct a figure with substance and dimensionality. He integrated academic themes in the foreground. Symbols of wisdom are present. Books, square and compasses, a gnomon, an inkwell with quills, and an astrolabe are all present. In her right hand, she holds the martyr's palm. Her left-hand rests on a spiked wheel. In the same hand, she also holds a cross. She looks at the cross indicating a connection with Jesus. Her stance is very similar to a painting by Venetian painter Lorenzo Lotto. His Saint Catherine resembles the pose of Palladas's work. Her head is shifted to our right. Her waist and legs are shifted towards our left.
She is enthroned and dressed in royal attire. The model was an elaborate Venetian garment. Her cape-like Pellegrina is draped over her dress. It follows the traditional Greek Italian Byzantine style where the stole is draped over her left arm. The cape-like garment also features two eagles. To our left, a book rests on an ornamented Venetian style lectern. Below the books, there is a Greek inscription:Αἰκατερίνα καὶ σοφὴ καὶ παρθένος, ἐκ δὲ ξίφους καὶ μάρτυς, ὢ καλὰ τρία (The three virtues of Catherine, wise, pure and martyred by the sword. His signature is also on the painting ΧΕΙΡ ΙΕΡΕΜΙΟΥ (by the hand of Jeremiah).
Scientific Element
Countless researchers have studied the painting due to its scientific component. Historian Flora Vafea wrote a detailed analysis of the painting in her paper entitled The Astronomical Instruments in Saint Catherine's iconography at the Holy Monastery of Sinai. The paper details the intricate scientific element within the painting. In front of the spiked wheel on top of two books, the painter adds an astronomical instrument. Palladas painted intricate details on the device. The astronomical instrument was the pictorial representation of astronomical scientific knowledge at that time.
The instrument was called System of the Universe (Σύστημα τοῦ Παντός). The instrument is a solid globe. It contains detailed inscriptions relating to astronomy. It offers five parallel segments the arctic circle, summer colure or (summer tropic), equator, winter colure or (winter tropic), and the antarctic circle. It also features two depictions of the zodiac. The circle turns either left or right. It features unequal divisions of zodiac signs. There are unequal divisions of ecliptic symbols longer at the center and shorter at the sides.
The celestial spheres are drawn from the Ptolemaic system. Earth is depicted as a blue sphere with circles of geographic coordinates. The line representing the axis of the Earth covers the entire instrument. The Earth casts a bluish shadow on the opposite side of the Sun, and the Moon turns its illuminated part towards the Sun. There are twelve more spheres. The spheres are named in Greek: Selene (moon), Hermes (Mercury), Aphrodite (Venus), Helios (Sun), Ares (Mars), Zeus (Jupiter), and Chronos (Saturn). They are also represented by unique symbols. Fixed stars are also present, they are painted as red and white spots. The depiction of the stars and the five circles on the celestial globes was observed by astronomers Geminus and Leontios Mechanikos.
The five parallel celestial circles outline six zones. A greek phrase is written on the outer circle outlining the different phases of the sun. The instrument features attributes of the sun written in Greek. In the north, it outlines: frigid, temperate, and torrid. In the south, it outlines: torrid, temperate and frigid. The painter also adds a zodiac circle on the slanted line of the instrument. It also features the symbols for Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces. The lines are separated by degrees. The instrument also features a calendar and a meridian ring. The instrument closely resembles an astrolabe. His contemporaries added an armillary sphere or a celestial globe in their versions of his painting.

Juan Gálvez (died 1507) was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Terracina, Priverno e Sezze (1500–1507).
Biography
Juan Galvez was a native of Seville, Spain. He was born in 1439, in October, probably on the 20th. He was a Doctor in utroque iure, and a protege of Cardinal Oliviero Carafa. He was appointed President of the Apostolic Camera. He was a writer of papal bulls (scriptor apostolicarum bullarum), for whose services substantial fees were due from the intended recipients; he rose to be Master of the Registry of papal bulls.
On 18 December 1500, he was appointed by Pope Alexander VI as Bishop of Terracina, Priverno e Sezze. The right to appoint the bishop of Terracina was reserved to the pope by John XXII and all of his successors. Terracina, moreover, was hierarchically directly dependent upon the Holy See (Papacy). Galvez served as Bishop of Terracina, Priverno e Sezze until his death on (according to David Cheney) 8 August 1507.
According to his tombstone, he died on "viii Id. Aug. MDVII", that is, 6 August 1507.

Eucalyptus crebra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironbark, narrow-leaved red ironbark or simply ironbark, and as muggago in the indigenous Dharawal language, is a species of small to medium-sized tree endemic to eastern Australia. It has hard, rough "ironbark" from its trunk to small branches, linear to lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, nine or eleven, white flowers and cup-shaped, barrel-shaped or hemispherical fruit. A variable species, it grows in woodland and forest from the Cape York Peninsula to near Sydney. It is an important source of nectar in the honey industry and its hard, strong timber is used in construction.
Description
Eucalyptus crebra is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has persistent thick, rough, deeply furrowed, greyish black "ironbark" from the base of its trunk to the small branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have linear to lance-shaped or curved leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are linear to lance-shaped, the same dull green to greyish colour on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, nine or eleven, usually on a branching inflorescence on the ends of branchlets. Each group is carried on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are club-shaped, spindle-shaped, or diamond-shaped to oval, long and wide and green to yellow with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering has been recorded in most months and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, barrel-shaped or hemispherical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long.
Taxonomy and naming
Eucalyptus crebra was first formally described in Journal and Proceedings of the Linnean Society, Botany by Victorian state botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1859. The specific epithet is the Latin adjective crebra meaning "thick", "close" or "numerous", referring to the species' abundance.
Narrow-leaved ironbark has included several species, including E. drepanophylla and E. xanthoclada but these are regarded as synonyms by the Australian Plant Census. Eucalyptus repanophylla is accepted as a separate species by the Queensland Government. Other similar species include E. exilipes, E. granitica, E. staigeriana, E. quadricostata and E. whitei.
Distribution and habitat
The narrow-leaved ironbark grows in sandy soils in woodland and forest from Picton, southwest of Sydney, north through New South Wales and Queensland to the vicinity of Cairns.
Uses
The tree has a hard, strong, and dark red timber, which has been used for sleepers and construction. A plank has been recorded as being used for Elizabeth Farm, Australia's oldest surviving European dwelling. It is used as a shade tree or to line roadways, and is also available as a cultivar. It is useful in honey production as the flowers are heavy in nectar and pollen; the resulting honey produced by bees is light-coloured and delicately flavoured.

Daniel Philip Hemingway (born 3 June 1989) is a rugby union player. After spending time on loan at Nottingham from the Leicester Tigers, Dan will leave Leeds Carnegie at the end of the 2012–13 season.
His position is usually at blindside flanker, but he has also played at No. 8 and occasionally at lock.
Educated at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield, Hemingway previously played for Lichfield before joining the Leicester Academy in 2006. He made his first team debut in the 2008–09 Guinness Premiership.
He was part of the Leicester Tigers team to beat a South Africa XV at Welford Road as well as scoring a try in a defeat to the Classic All Blacks.
Dan played for Nottingham on loan for two seasons with dual registration, playing for both Nottingham and Leicester Tigers. This gave him plenty of experience, playing in both the Championship and for the Tigers too. He also played in the British Irish Cup and Championship Play Offs for Nottingham during his time there.
Dan joined Leeds Carnegie before the 2011–12 season on a two-year contract, making his debut on the opening day of the Championship season against London Welsh. He became a regular in the team throughout the season making 22 appearances in total.
A shattered patella during his second season at Leeds lead to Dan being forced to retire from playing in 2013 despite an attempted return to play with Cambridge Rugby Club.

Gilberton is a rural locality in the City of Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. In the Gilberton had a population of 25 people.
Geography
The land is flat and low-lying, being less than above sea level. It is well-watered by a number of creeks. Most of the land use is growing sugarcane with a small area of grazing on native vegetation in the west of the locality.In the Gilberton had a population of 25 people.
History
In the Gilberton had a population of 25 people.
Environmental issues
Gilberton has acid sulphate soil in naturally water-logged conditions. The lowering of the water table due to drainage work on the Pimpama River allows oxidisation of the iron sulfide to create sulphuric acid which can, in turn, enable the release of iron, aluminium and other heavy metals, doing damage to both the natural and built environment. Application of lime to neutralise low pH levels and the maintenance of broad shallow drains to reduce oxidisation are used to mitigate the problem.
Gold Coast Intra Regional Transport Corridor
The proposed Gold Coast Intra Regional Transport Corridor will connect Gold Coast suburbs from Coomera to Carrara with a multi-modal urban arterial road by 2031. It is proposed to reserve a land corridor from Coomera to Stapylton for future extensions; on current plans, this land corridor will pass through Gilberton near the confluence of Sandy Creek and Halfway Creek.

A semi-feral animal lives predominantly in a feral state but has some contact and experience with humans. This may be because it was born in a domesticated state and then reverted to life in wild conditions, or it may be an animal that grew up in essentially wild conditions but has developed a comfort level with humans through feeding, receiving medical care, or similar contacts.
Species of semi-feral animals
Semi-feral or stray cats live in proximity to humans who may be accustomed to their presence but have no owner; they are distinct from feral cats, which have no regular food source. They are usually regularly fed in locations where food is left for no one cat in particular, and they find shelter "accidentally", such as in farm buildings, and sometimes deliberately from humans. A common reason to tolerate and even nourish these cats is so they kill vermin, or because of a general favorable feeling toward cats. Usually semi-ownership of cats contributes to cat overpopulation and excessive breeding when people nourish but not neuter the cats.
Of horse breeds, the French Camargue was once thought of as a wild species, though increased contact with humans has made it semi-feral. These horses still breed in herds and graze throughout plains unhindered, though ranchers (known as gardians, "Camargue cowboys", and manadiers, "ranchers") regularly round them up to check on newborn foals. If captured, Camargue horses, generally steady-footed and considered reliable, are usually used to herd cattle. Other types of mostly free-ranging horses, such as those in Iberia and the Exmoor, New Forest, Fell pony and Dartmoor ponies, have owners which distinguishes them from truly feral horses, such as the American Mustang or Australian Brumby.
A high mortality rate exists among free-ranging dogs (often called "strays"), even those supported by humans; the stray dog population is often replenished by domestic dogs. Most abandoned dogs in the Western world are taken to shelters, except in some dense North American urban centers and rural Southern Europe, particularly Italy, where abandoned dogs become feral or semi-feral. Some semi-feral dogs that receive a substantial portion of their diet from humans can afford to exert energy hunting prey; many dogs are unsuccessful hunters without human support. Semi-feral dogs are more likely to transmit disease than their domestic counterparts. Local cultural attitudes make how humans interact with stray dogs quite variable.
Many types of birds can be semi-feral, including mute swans, mallards, and barbary doves. Perhaps the best-known semi-feral bird is the pigeon, which people have been known to attract to their households for some 3,000 years. It is difficult to raise pigeons—they are monogamous, altricial, and require large spaces for flight—so a semi-feral method of trapping is presently the most efficient. From Egypt to West Africa large buildings have been constructed for the purpose of attracting semi-feral pigeons, some holding up to 1,000.
Bagot goats live semi-ferally in Blithfield Hall in Staffordshire, England, where they were introduced in the 14th century. Buffalo can become feral when abandoned; in northern Australia, they are raised for slaughter despite not being fully domesticated. The semi-feral Corriente cattle were killed for poor-quality beef in the 20th century and are now often used in rodeo. Semi-feral sheep have existed throughout Europe.

Black Sheep is an English anarcho-folk band formed by singer/songwriter and counter-cultural activist Julian Cope. They are the most recent of Cope's ongoing side projects, which include Brain Donor and Queen Elizabeth.
Background and work
The origins of Black Sheep lie in Julian Cope's 2008 solo album Black Sheep, for which he assembled a varied group of contributing musicians both from his longstanding talent pool and from more recent associates. Black Sheep was a predominantly acoustic project, dominated by Cope's vocals and Mellotron playing and by varied contributions mainly played on acoustic guitars and large bass drums. Besides Cope (who also played guitars, bass guitar, synthesizer and bass drum), the album featured long-term Cope sidemen Patrick "Holy" McGrail (synthesizer) and Doggen (guitar, bass guitar, harmonica, drums and backing vocals - also of Spiritualized), plus acoustic guitarists/singers/drum beaters Michael O'Sullivan and Ady "Acoustika" Fletcher. The album also credited a "blasphemous movie division" run by "Big Nige", and a "law council" featuring McGrail, Big Nige, and "Vybik Jon".
On 27 October 2008 Cope and various Black Sheep related musicians began the "Joe Strummer Memorial Busking Tour", a 3-day-long busking tour of UK cultural centres as defined by Cope. These included several locations in London (the statues of Emily Pankhurst, Winston Churchill and Thomas Carlyle; the Wat Tyler memorial on Blackheath Common; and Karl Marx's grave in Highgate Cemetery), the Eddie Cochran memorial in Chippenham, the site of the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester, the King's Standing and Swanborough Tump barrows and Carl Jung's statue in Liverpool.
Working on Black Sheep both as an album and as a counter-cultural touring event inspired Cope to extend the concept to a full band (later described, although not by Cope, as "an assortment of the chemically damaged and the intellectually fired-up"). Acoustika, O'Sullivan and McGrail remained on board, while Vybik Jon and Big Nige stepped up as additional performers. Also added were several new recruits - drummer Antony Hodgkinson (Antronhy), Christophe F. (formerly of Universal Panzies), "Fat Paul" Horlick (on electronics and drums), Adam "Randy Apostle" Whittaker (who'd previously mostly worked with Cope as an engineer), and the more obscure "Hebbs" and "Common Era". All of these members played on the Black Sheep debut double album Kiss My Sweet Apocalypse, released in 2009.
Rather than being just another Cope vehicle, it became clear that Black Sheep was considered a collective effort on the evidence of the album's second half, which featured tracks led by individual group members (McGrail on the 24-minute epic "Kiss My Sweet Apocalypse" and Christophe F. on "We're The Baa-aa-aader Meinhof", "You Can Gaol The Revolutionary, But You Cannot Gaol The Revolution" and "Heathen Frontiers In Sound"). The group recorded several BBC sessions which were released the same year on Black Sheep at the BBC. Musically, this featured the same lineup as the debut album bar Whitaker and Hebbs, and with the addition of the group's engineer (singer-songwriter David Wrench) on grand piano and vocals plus additional vocalist Eddi Fiegel. Attention to the sleevenotes of the albums illustrated Black Sheep's increasingly collective approach – Fiegel also served as one of the group's photographers, while the musically absent Hebbs had contributed a painting. Other contributors to Black Sheep have included Cope's wife Dorian Cope, performing under the pseudonym of "Mother of the Revolution" (Dorian Cope's radical blog " On This Deity" is also a Black Sheep project).
The collective approach has also allowed for an increasing number of releases foregrounding individual group members and associates. Christophe F. stepped to the fore on 2009's Heathen Frontiers in Sound which he predominantly wrote while backed by the group. Black Sheep have also backed David Wrench on his 2010 album Spades, Hoes, Plows (for which they were co-credited).

Teresa Elizabeth Furtado (1845 – 9 August 1877) was a well-known actress at London's Adelphi Theatre where she played leading melodramatic roles for nine seasons.
She was the daughter of Charles Furtado, professor of music in London and composer of ballads. Her appearances at the Adelphi included No Thoroughfare by Wilkie Collins and Charles Dickens (1868) and Esmeralda in Notre-Dame or, The Gipsy Girl of Paris, a dramatized version of Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1875). She also appeared in the premieres of two early works by W.S. Gilbert – as Pocahontas in his 1867 burlesque, Robinson Crusoe at the Haymarket Theatre and as Jenny Wren in his 1867 pantomime, Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren at the Lyceum Theatre.
In 1873 she married the English actor, John Clarke. Her premature death at the age of 32 led to his breakdown and he died less than two years later.

The LAR-160 is a light artillery rocket (hence LAR) with a 160mm calibre, a minimum range of 12 km and a maximum range of 45 km, from a multiple rocket launcher. Each standard launcher holds two 13 rocket Launch Pod Containers (LPC's) for truck or trailer mounting, 18 rocket LPC's for medium armored vehicle's (AMX-13, TAM) and 26 rocket LPC's for mounting on a MBT chassis. A light version is also manufactured which can be carried by helicopters and towed behind vehicles such as a HMMWV.
Development
The LAR-160 was designed in the late 1970s by Israel Military Industries, it was adopted by the Israeli Defense Forces in 1983.
Armament
The LAR-160s rocket has undergone continuous development and has resulted in the Mk. I, Mk. II and Mk.IV rockets.
Mk. I Rocket
The Mk. I rocket is 3.4 m long and has a diameter of 160 mm fueled by solid propellant. The Mk. I am 100 kg and has a 40 kg HE-COFRAM (High Explosive-Controlled Fragmentation) warhead which is activated by an impact fuze or proximity fuze. The Mk. 1 was first used by the Venezuelan Army on an AMX-13 hull.
Mk. II Rocket
The Mk. II rocket weighs 110 kg and has a 46 kg warhead which is either HE-COFRAM or a cluster warhead containing 104 CL-3022-S4 AP/AM submunitions. A remotely set electronic fuze opens the canister at the appropriate height to give area coverage of about 31,400 m2.
All 26 rockets can be fired in under 60 seconds and re-loaded in under five minutes from a conventional truck with a 15 t/m crane.
Launcher
The LAR-160 incorporates a modern command, control, communications and intelligence system called ACCS, which has a total interface capability to all common artillery elements including meteorological unit, forward observers as well as mapping, GPS and other items.
Elevation and traverse of the launchers are performed by an electrohydraulic system, which is backed up by a manual system. When the system is fitted on a wheeled chassis, two hydraulically operated stabilisers are lowered to the ground to provide a more stable firing platform.
Service history
The system was used extensively by the Georgian Army against Russian and South Ossetian Forces in the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, systems showed to be extremely effective against Ossetian static targets and large Russian convoys, LAR systems were credited with destroying many Russian trucks and disabling armored vehicles.
Romania uses a domestic version of the LAR-160, called LAROM and Argentina uses a domestic version as well called TAM VCLC.
The HALO Trust reported that Azerbaijan employed the LAR-160 to drop M095 rocket-dispensed cluster bombs around Armenian-populated settlements in the NKR during the 2016 Armenian–Azerbaijani clashes.
The Human Rights Watch verified Azerbaijani multiple usage of the LAR-160 to drop M095 rocket-dispensed cluster bombs against populated settlements in Nagorno-Karabakh in October 2020.

The 1992–93 San Jose Sharks season was the team's second in the NHL. They set league records for most losses in a season with 71 losses, and most consecutive losses, with 17 in a row. Their worst defeat of the season was a 13-1 loss to the Calgary Flames, a game where after the Sharks scored first, the Flames countered by scoring 13 unanswered goals.
The team had recorded its first shutout, attained by rookie goaltender Arturs Irbe, and Rob Gaudreau scored the first hat-trick in franchise history. Head coach George Kingston, the first head coach in the history of the Sharks, was fired following this tumultuous season and replaced by Kevin Constantine. It was the last season the Sharks played in the Cow Palace in Daly City.
Offseason
The Sharks chose Mike Rathje with their first-round pick in the entry draft, third overall.
Regular season
The Sharks allowed the most goals (414) and most even-strength goals (286) of all 24 teams during the regular season. They were also shut out a league-high 6 times and tied the Edmonton Oilers and Ottawa Senators for the fewest power-play goals scored, with 66.
On Tuesday, November 17, 1992, Arturs Irbe recorded the first shutout in Sharks history, as San Jose blanked the Los Angeles Kings 6-0 at home.
On Thursday, December 3, 1992, in a 7-5 home loss against the Hartford Whalers, Rob Gaudreau scored the first hat trick in Sharks history. In that same game, Kelly Kisio and Johan Garpenlov each recorded 4 points (1 goal, 3 assists).
In 2004, ESPN ranked the 1992-93 Sharks as the sixth worst team in the first 25 years of the ESPN era.

Chen Chi-li (11 May 1943 – 4 October 2007), nicknamed King Duck or Dry Duck, was a gangster from Taiwan, best known for heading the United Bamboo Gang. His murder of dissident journalist Henry Liu in Daly City, California, United States, in 1984 has been described by the Financial Times as "the most prominent example of the Kuomintang's co-operation with gangsters in upholding its dictatorship".
Biography
Early life
Chen was born in Sichuan to a father of Hunan origin and a mother of Jiangsu origin; his father was a civil servant with the Republic of China government. When the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist government fled from mainland China at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, he followed his parents to Taiwan. There, he entered a school in which most of the students were born locally. As one of only three non-locals in his class, he became a frequent target of bullying; he and fellow students with roots in the mainland began to form gangs for their own protection.
United Bamboo
He joined a local gang at 12, and United Bamboo Association (uniting all the "non-local" gangs to stand up against another local gang) was created a couple of years later; it was at this time that he acquired his nickname of "Dry Duck". While still a member of the gang, he went on to receive a bachelor's degree in engineering from Tam Kiang College (now Tamkang University), and served in the army as a lieutenant. He became the head of the gang in April 1968; under his leadership, its membership would grow to over a hundred thousand, making it the largest gang in Taiwan.
In 1970, he was sentenced to five years in jail for aggravated assault; he was sent to the infamous rehabilitation centre on Green Island, off the coast of Taitung County. Upon regaining his freedom in 1976, he turned his attention to business, establishing Cheng An Enterprise, which sold fire equipment; he grew CAE's market share to 70% in just three years, and soon expanded his activities to other industries such as electronics, stainless steel products, record production, nightclubs, and hydraulic engineering. In 1983, he even started a gang-related magazine which reported on the activities of Taiwan's various criminal groups.
Murder of Henry Liu
Chen claimed he received the order to kill Henry Liu on 14 August 1984, from KMT officials angered by Liu's authorship of a biography critical of Republic of China president Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Chiang Kai-shek. They allegedly offered him a US$20,000 reward to carry out the murder, which he refused, instead agreeing to kill Liu without compensation out of "patriotism". For one month afterwards, he received training at the intelligence bureau's school at Yangmingshan, outside of Taipei, where intelligence officials gave him details of Liu's schedule and movements. During his training period, he also met with Chiang Hsiao-wu, son of Chiang Ching-kuo, whom he stated personally approved the killing.
Chen arrived in the United States on 14 September 1984. Chen and his associate had initially planned to murder Liu on their own by intercepting him at Liu's gift shop near Fisherman's Wharf; after finding the area to be too crowded, they decided instead to attack him in his home, and enlisted the help of Tung Kuei-sen, a fellow United Bamboo Gang member who was also in the area. The three ambushed Liu in his garage on 15 October 1984, where Wu and Tung shot him; a few days after the killing, Chen, Wu, and Tung all flew back to Taiwan together. Local police immediately suspected political motives, as Liu had not been robbed after he was killed; The New York Times noted that other critics of the KMT government had previously been killed in 1980 (the mother and twin daughters of Lin Yi-hsiung) and 1981 (Chen Wen-chen).
Chen was identified as "the Asian man who couldn't speak English" by neighborhood children after the shooting, as he was found feeding candy to their lost dog while he had been staking out Liu's home. Chen and Wu were arrested on 12 November 1984 in Taiwan as part of "Operation Clean Sweep", a large-scale campaign against organized crime. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) named Chen as the leader of the plot to murder Liu in late November 1984.
Chen made a tape-recorded confession on 18 October after he realized that officials had misled him about Liu's links to Communism; Chen emphasized he had not taken any payment for the murder, but was acting out of a deep sense of patriotism. After returning to Taiwan, he learned the government officials would not support him. Fearing that he would be betrayed, Chen had left the recorded confession with his associate, "Yellow Bird", in Houston, Texas, providing details and naming the officials behind the case, including Admiral Wang Hsi-ling, the head of Taiwan's Bureau of Military Intelligence. After the FBI obtained the tape from Chen's fellow gang members, the three officials named were arrested by Taiwanese authorities on 15 January 1985; the Taiwanese government also admitted the Bureau of Military Intelligence had been involved in the murder. The FBI issued a warrant for Chen's arrest and requested that he be extradited from Taiwan to stand trial in the United States; however, since formal diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Taiwan were discontinued in 1978, there was no extradition treaty in place.
At his 1985 trial in Taipei, Chen testified in more detail about the connection with the KMT, claiming that Admiral Wang had ordered him to kill Liu because Liu was a double agent, spying for both Taiwan and mainland China. Chen claims he disobeyed the order and instructed his associates to "teach [Liu] a lesson" and avoid killing or crippling him. Chen, Wang, and Wu were all sentenced to life in prison on 9 April 1985.
Jerome Cohen, then a professor of law at Harvard University, attended an administrative hearing for Chen and Wu on behalf of Liu's widow Helen Liu; he derided the trial as a "well-rehearsed performance", stating that the two read their statements from notebooks, and implied that their testimonies had been coached by the Taiwanese government, who sought to portray Wang as a rogue officer acting alone, and avoid other intelligence officials being implicated. The week after the trial, the U.S. House of Representatives passed by a vote of 387-2 a non-binding resolution () calling on Taipei to extradite Chen and Wu to the United States to stand trial there; the "nay" votes came from Bob Stump (R-AZ) and Howard C. Nielson (R-UT). Taipei rejected the request the following day. Less than two months after his conviction, Chen retracted his accusations against Wang.
Chen, Wang, and Wu were given clemency by the Taiwanese government and released in January 1991. He and Wu were treated as "heroes" by the media and the public; Chen declared his intention to transform the United Bamboo Gang into a legitimate business enterprise, and established Chuan An Construction, which was successful not only in the booming construction industry on Taiwan, but also made large investments outside Taiwan as well, including an RMB10 billion resort project in Hunan's Moon Lake area.
Exile and death
Five years after his release, Chen fled to Cambodia to avoid further organized crime-related charges in Taiwan under Operation Chih-ping, a police operation which sought to round up various gang figures. He had just been diagnosed with cancer, and his doctor had advised him to go somewhere relaxing and avoid stress. He married Chen Yi-fan in a ceremony there in 1998. In July 2000, he made news again after being arrested for illegal possession of firearms; the Cambodian police had moved against him after Taiwanese television stations broadcast images of him showing off his guns. Chen claimed the guns had been purchased for self-defense in the aftermath of the 1997 coup by Hun Sen. He lived quite luxuriously in Cambodia, alone in his villa, while his wife and children remained in Taiwan.
Chen was hospitalised at St. Teresa's Hospital of Hong Kong in August 2007 due to the worsening of his pancreatic cancer; he remained there until his death in October of that same year. His body was flown back to Taiwan on 18 October. Fellow Liu killer Wu Tun, with whom Chen had remained friends, helped to organise his funeral; over three thousand people came to pay their respects. Among the mourners were major politicians from both the blue and green camps such as Wang Jin-pyng of the Kuomintang and Ker Chien-Ming of the Democratic Progressive Party, as well as various celebrities of whom the most prominent was popular singer Jay Chou; they suffered harsh criticism for their attendance, including a Taipei Times editorial, which characterised the politicians' presence as "revolting" and stated that Chou "should be ashamed, but we are not sure if he has the depth of character to feel it." Chou, who showed up wearing sunglasses and left after only 20 minutes, had become acquainted with Chen through his son Baron Chen, with whom Chou had previously worked in the filming of Kung Fu Dunk. Other attendees, including black-clad teenagers and those carrying knives and firearms, were turned away by the hundreds of police who came out to the funeral to maintain order. A total of fourteen United Bamboo Gang members were arrested in connection with the funeral.
Personal life
Chen had been married three times. From the three women he had three sons and three daughters.

Félix-Albert Pel (12 June 1849 – 9 June 1924) was a French criminal and serial killer. He was nicknamed The Watchmaker of Montreuil.
At Landru's trial, the latter was compared to Pel because of the many similarities between the two cases.
Youth
Born in Grand-Coeur, in the municipality of Aigueblanche, Albert Pel was the son of a watchmaker and a merchant; his parents separated shortly after his birth, apparently because of adulterous acts committed by his mother. In this regard, Pel said during his trial he suffered from "insecurities if he really was the child of the Savoie watchmaker". Each spouse lived on his side: Mr. Pel remained in Bourg-Saint-Maurice, and Ms. Pel moved to Paris. She was remembered for her modest trade of religious objects on Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie street. The child was raised by his father and then collected by one of his uncles.
In 1859, an uncle who was interested in Albert Pel, master Flandin, a lawyer at Moûtiers, proposed to send him to Paris to finish his education and make his apprenticeship. Pel therefore resided mainly with his mother, who entrusted the boy first to the sisters of Saint Augustine, then to the brothers of Saint Nicolas, Vaugirard.
At the age of fifteen, he entered MM. Leriel and Maucolin, and in 1868, he went out to become a worker, in the Manceau timepiece, first on 17th Rue La Fayette, then in the Josse house, 13th Rue De Douai. Albert Pel still lived with his mother, on rue Bleue. When business did not prosper, they moved to Rochechouart street in the middle of 1869, where Pel opened a watch business. Miss Reichenbach, a neighbor of the Pels, testified during the trial of the lack of sympathy of Pel had for his mother.
First murder
In the early days of August 1872, Ms. Pel was seized with severe colic. The doctor visited her only once, finding pain in the abdomen and stomach, and obstructions of the airways. On 26 August, she died without her son being badly affected. According to witnesses, he even exclaimed: "She is there!" The death certificate will note as cause of death "chronic bronchitis". Pel insisted that no one came to watch the body, nor to witness the burial. The neighbours supposed that the strange noises that they heard that day were the work of Pel, seeking to discover hidden valuables in the house.
In 1873, it was his father's turn to die in Bourg Saint-Maurice. Albert Pel, not having moved from Paris, seemed totally alienated to this death. He collected the inheritance, about 25,000 francs. The investigation noted that for the occasion, Pel wore a red ribbon at his buttonhole, which intrigued the people attending the funeral. When asked, he would answer:
First signs of psychic disorders
Pel moved a lot. From 1872 to 1874, He lived in different neighborhoods where he sometimes presented himself as a mathematics teacher at Lycée Saint-Louis, sometimes as a professor of rhetoric, sometimes as an organist of the Sainte-Trinité, decorating himself with decorations he had no right to use. He would also tell a fellow student, Mr. Hubert, about the death of his mother, that she was struck down with an induction coil that he had in his possession.
In July 1874, he moved to Passy, Raynouard Street. His excellent behaviour, his seriousness, his assiduousness of the pusher had won him public attention, when, in October 1877, an unfortunate event occurred. A creditor, Mr. Serin, apparently particularly discourteous, claimed the payment of a debt of 2,000 francs. Pel began by responding with threatening letters, then one day went to his opponent's home to shoot him. Disarmed and taken to the Police Commissioner, Pel was detained. Divagging, he was quickly taken to the infirmary, where he was examined, and recognized as delusional. He was placed at Sainte-Anne, where he remained a month under observation. When he was released, the specialists declared him radically cured; he settled with the creditor.
First disappearance
Returning to Paris, he successively opened a pastry shop, an advertising agency, then became a director and a sponsor of the Théâtre des Délassements-Comiques. In 1878, he moved to Doudeauville Street, where he used the name of Cuvillier, with the agreement of Mrs. Cuvillier, to protect himself from his creditors. In May 1879, he moved to Ternes, Doisy Street, in an apartment where he now dealt only with physics and chemistry; he then gives himself the title of physician.
With him lived two women: Marie Mahoin, his servant, and Eugénie Meyer, his mistress, seamstress in her fifties, who used to mend costumes at the Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe. Two months later, Meyer and Mahoin were both suddenly sick with vomiting and diarrhea; they complained, moreover, of an unquenchable thirst. Meyer had fallen ill first; the servant had treated her for some time; then, very suffering herself, between 19 July 1880 at Beaujon Hospital. Eight days were enough to restore her health, but in the meantime, Meyer went missing. Since the departure of his servant, Pel lived as a recluse in his home, passing his mail through a fanlight. Miss Mahoin, wishing to resume her service for Pel. The now-odd looking man refused to let her enter his home, and as she wanted to at least take away the trunk she had left when she left, he closed the door, asked for her to wait a few minutes, then gave to her the effects she had asked for. A first judicial inquiry was opened to investigate the disturbing disappearance of Eugenie. Pel was the main suspect of the investigation, but due to lack of serious evidence, he benefited from a non-suit order. Pel then came to live on Avenue Kléber where he began to practice the watchmaking profession.
Second wave of deaths
First marriage
On 26 August 1880, Pel married a young girl named Eugénie Buffereau, a saleswoman employed by a merchant on the Avenue d'Eylau (now Avenue Victor-Hugo), who brought him a dowry of about 4,000 francs. A month later, the young woman suffered from constant vomiting and complained of a burning thirst.
On 21 October, Bufferau's mother visited her with a beautiful girl, following a note she received from her own daughter, saying: "Come quickly if you want to see me again alive! " Bufferau wanted to eat at the table, but could barely stand up, and vomited a lot. A doctor, Dr. Raoult, was called: he first believed that it was poisoning by fungi, then concluded it was acute gastroenteritis. She died on October 24, 1880, in the total indifference of her husband. Her family, scandalized, thought to seize the Justice before being changed, for fear of a scandal. In 1884, when the watchmaker was arrested, Bufferau's corpse was exhumed, and her remains were examined by the experts: there was a significant quantity of arsenic. Pel argued that his wife was taking Fowler's solution.
Second marriage
Pel ran away again in 1881, and remained on Dôme Street, Passy. He wooed for a few weeks Miss Angèle Dufaure Murat-Bellisle, whom he had employed for some time as an apprentice. The union materialized, but the beautiful family, wary, wanted to establish a marriage contract, to protect the dowry of about 5,000 francs. Pel, fiercely opposed, consented after the ceremony to establish a will under which, in case of death, he bequeathed his property to his widow, but only if his wife and his mother do the same for his benefit.
After the wedding, the Pel couple, accompanied by Mrs. Dufaure-Murat, decided to settle in Nanterre. Pel went back to studying poisons, while continuing his watchmaking profession. He develops a certain Philloxericide of Dr. Pel, supposedly destined to revolutionize the regions of vineyards. In addition, he obtained authorization from the Paris Police Prefecture to sell poisonous substances and chemicals. Mrs Dufaure-Murat did not take long to begin suffering from violent colics. Frightened by the large amount of dangerous substances in the house to which she attributed her indisposition, she eventually moved to Paris, leaving the young couple alone. In April, Pel's wife, pregnant (she would give birth a few weeks before the trial), abandoned him for the nascent relationship he had with Élise Boehmer, a servant of forty years who repaired watches.
In Montreuil
On 21 June 1884, Pel and Élise Boehmer moved to Montreuil-sous-Bois, 9th l'Église Street. On 2 July, Boehmer fell sick, suffering from colic and vomiting that caused her intolerable suffering. Two neighbors came to provide daily care until July 12, when Pel moved to the bedside. The patient's pulse disappeared in the evening, and never gave further signs of life. During the night, it was reported by several witnesses that Pel had masked the windows with black fabrics and carpets; others complained of the terrible smell that came from the kitchen and attest to having seen the watchmaker light large fires in an oven, which only went out at sunrise. The prosecutor's office, after a summary investigation, suspected him of cremating his girlfriend and ordered for his arrest. Pel defended himself: according to him, Élise Boehmer, feeling much better, left him on July 13, with a coachman that he would have gone himself to look for more than five kilometers, Faubourg Saint-Antoine. After police investigation, Albert Pel was accused of seven poisonings and was sent back to the cour d'assises.
Trial
Pel appeared on 11 June 1885 before the Assizes Court of Seine. The trial, chaired by Mr. Councilor Dubard, lasted three days. The indictment noted seven poisonings over ten years, but only two were pursued (those of Eugénie Buffereau and Élise Boehmer). Albert Pel repelled all charges. He pleaded innocent and was defended by a young lawyer who has been appointed ex officio, Mr. Joly, a trainee lawyer.
Pel, aged 36 at the time of his conviction, was, according to the newspapers of the time of average height and puny appearance; his face, very peculiar, had as much marked the spirits of the time as the originality of his crimes. Very intelligent, he had black hair, lying back; his face was thin and yellowish; had extraordinarily prominent cheekbones; his eyes were sheltered behind gold glasses; he had a long, pointed nose; his lips were thin and discolored, and he had a black mustache and goatee. During both trials, he appeared dressed in black and wearing a white headscarf. His nonchalance, often noted by the journalists, contrasted with the seriousness of the accusations against him. Until the end, he proclaimed his innocence.
Throughout the trial, the Crown, in the person of Advocate General Bernard, highlighted Pel's greed. All the victims had the same symptoms: epigastric pain, choking, nausea, burning sensation in the digestive system, bowel problems, diarrhea, rapid debilitation, spasms, slow agony: the various characters, very clearly marked, of the intoxication with arsenic. No less than fifty witnesses, including experts, explained how he could have dismembered and destroyed the remains of Élise Boehmer, according to them, in the back shop of Montreuil. In forty hours, the furnace transported to the morgue would have destroyed even the last vestige of a human body. With regard to the prosecution evidence, one retained ashes, found in quantity in Pel; a saw, stained with blood and greasy matter; a hatchet and a kitchen knife covered with suspicious stains; a cast iron stove suspected of being used to cremate the dead bodies; a book of chemicals, and another one dealing with poisons, as well as a staggering amount of chemicals of all kinds.
On 13 June 1885, after three quarters of an hour of deliberation, the jurors found Pel not guilty of the poisoning of Eugénie Buffereau, but guilty of the murder of Élise Boehmer. Albert Pel, 36, was sentenced to death. However, following a defect of form (one of the jurors was bankrupt and not rehabilitated) brought the cassation of the judgment and the return to the cour d'assises of Melun. The benefit of the acquittal for the poisoning of Ms. Buffereau remained with him, only the question of the death of Elise Boehmer remained to be debated. On 14 August, the jury of Seine-et-Marne found Pel guilty of having poisoned Boehmer, but granted him the benefit of extenuating circumstances; Pel was sentenced to penal labour in perpetuity and would serve his sentence at the prison of New Caledonia in Bourail.
He died there on 9 June 1924, three days before his seventy-fifth birthday, which made him the oldest convict in France.

Robert Stivers (born November 17, 1953) is an American fine-art photographer. His work is collected by museums from New York to Paris and Cologne and shown in galleries worldwide.
Best known for his captivating images and darkroom technique, The New Yorker describes his work as “Ghostly black-and-white images whose theatricality smartly complements their mystery.”
Early years
Robert Stivers was born in Palo Alto, California to collegiate parents. His father had received a Ph.D. in civil engineering from Stanford and had a notable career as an aerospace engineer, while his mother had graduated summa cum laude from Stanford and went on to be politically involved in California. At a very young age he moved with his family to Pasadena, California where he attended Polytechnic Private School.
Stivers attended the University of California in Irvine and received his B.A. in 1976 studying history. During his time at UC, he took a dance class at the Jimmie DeFore Dance Center and, after graduating, decided to move to New York City in the late 1970s to pursue a career as a dancer.
In 1980, he performed with the Joffrey Ballet in New York City in a role in Moses Pendleton's revival of the old Dadaist ballet, Relâche.
He suffered a severe back injury that forced him to stop dancing for some time.
Following his injury, Stivers enrolled in graduate school at New York University where he studied Arts Management. He graduated in 1981 and began working at the American Ballet Theatre.
Photography career
1980s
After spending several years in California, Stivers decided to do something he felt was more purposeful. He began to meet photographers in his late twenties and ended up becoming an artists' representative in Los Angeles in 1983 for commercial photographers. He still felt like his creativity was being suppressed, but took the opportunity to learn about photography, studio lighting and printing.
In 1987, he took a photography class, titled “Finding your Own Vision,” at UCLA under the instruction of famous art photographer Jo Ann Callis and was inspired to pursue fine-art photography.
With a new inspiration and passion in 1988, at the age of 35, he began focusing on building his photography portfolio while living in Santa Monica.
1990s
Stivers relocated to Santa Fe in 1991, where he utilized his dance background in his photographic and film work. He would use a Super 8 camera to film himself dance. Stivers said, “I'd walk around on stage with my dance unfolding and the movie camera on fixed focus.” He started to take still images of the monitor displaying his films and began to play with the framing and focus of these images.
This body of work became known as ‘Series 5' and was shown at his first solo show in New York at Yancey Richardson Gallery in 1997. These photographs are also presented in his first book from Arena Editions, Robert Stivers: Photographs that was released in 1997.
The Village Voice describes Stivers' images from ‘Series 5' as “Livid figures nearly engulfed by a velvety, almost palpable darkness that are both ominous and gorgeous. More theatrical than Bill Jacobson's similarly isolated-and-soft-focus apparitions, these pictures suggest spiritual visions.”
2000s
Stivers' second book Listening to Cement was published by Arena Editions in 2000. The book is composed of photographs from his ‘Series 6' works, which included sea- and cloudscapes and architectural views, moving the viewer between indoors and outdoors.
Stivers' third book Sestina was published by Camera Work AG in 2003. This monograph was very successful and printed in 16-inch by 20-inch format. The book features rich bronze-toned prints of frayed objects and dream-like scenarios.
Stivers' fourth book Sanctum was published by Twin Palms in 2007. The book's essay was written by Eugenia Parry, who describes the work as “figments of his material philosophy of escape.”
In 2010, Stivers came out with a series called Craving the Seamstress, in which he photographed objects he found throughout the house of his ex-wife, whom he calls a “collector of curiosities.”
His newest book, The Art of Ruin, was published by Twin Palms in the spring of 2015 with an essay by Steven Brown.
Style
Trend Magazine describes Stivers' work as “darkly romantic images infused with a certain mystery that have made him one of our foremost contemporary photographers.”
He works with gelatin silver and platinum prints to create his unique images. Since he began shooting in 1987, he has used Hasselblad medium-format cameras to capture his captivating photographs.
In 1993 Stivers stepped away from printing clear photographs and began his unique signature process of using a sharply focused negative that is then manipulated in the darkroom to create intriguing, out-of-focus, blurry images. This effect causes intentional loss of clarity to achieve sensual, dream-like works akin to early Pictorialism at the turn of the twentieth century.
Stiver remarks that the photographs mirror his own process of self-transformation and re-creation. His distorting power reinvigorates classical tropes like nudes, sculpture, texture and architecture.
Collections
Robert Stivers' photographs have entered such collections as those of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the Fogg Museum at Harvard University, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago, and the Museum Ludwig in Cologne.
Stivers' work is also collected by some notable Hollywood names such as Ellen DeGeneres, Charlize Theron, Olivia Wilde and Donna Karan, to name a few.

Marsilea quadrifolia is a herbaceous plant found naturally in central and southern Europe, Caucasia, western Siberia, Afghanistan, south-west India, China, Japan, and Vietnam, though it is considered a weed in some parts of the United States, where it has been well established in the northeast for over 100 years. Its common names include four leaf clover; European waterclover (USA); sushni (India); aalaik keerai (Tamil).
Description
Aquatic fern bearing 4 parted leaf resembling 'Four-leaf clover' (Trifolium). Leaves floating in deep water or erect in shallow water or on land. Leaflets obdeltoid, to 3/4" long, glaucous, petioles to 8" long; Sporocarp (ferns) ellipsoid, to 3/16" long, dark brown, on stalks to 3/4" long, attached to base of petioles.
Uses
In some places it has been used as food for more than 3000 years. The plant is said to be anti-inflammatory, diuretic, depurative, febrifuge and refrigerant. It is also used to treat snakebite and applied to abscesses.
Cultivation
The plant prefers light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils. It can grow in semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It requires moist or wet soil and can grow in water.
Marsilea quadrifolia can be grown as a potted plant, either just with soil kept wet, or semi-submerged, with fronds emergent from the water, or fully submerged, with the fronds floating on the surface of the water.
In the aquarium, water clover is grown fully submerged, usually in the foreground where it spreads by means of runners. It normally seems to be unfussy as to light and water conditions, and doesn't need a rich substrate.
Marsilea are very easy to germinate from their sporocarps. However, the sporocarps must be abraded, cracked, or have an edge sliced off before submerging them in water so that the water can penetrate to swell the tissues, and germination is infrared-light dependent. Full sunlight is fine for this purpose.

In logic and mathematics, proof by example (sometimes known as inappropriate generalization) is a logical fallacy whereby the validity of a statement is illustrated through one or more examples or cases—rather than a full-fledged proof.
The structure, argument form and formal form of a proof by example generally proceeds as follows:
Structure:
I know that X is such.
Therefore, anything related to X is also such.
Argument form:
I know that x, which is a member of group X, has the property P.
Therefore, all other elements of X must have the property P.
Formal form:
The following example demonstrates why this line of reasoning is a logical fallacy:
I've seen a person shoot someone dead.
Therefore, all people are murderers.
In the common discourse, a proof by example can also be used to describe an attempt to establish a claim using statistically insignificant examples. In which case, the merit of each argument might have to be assessed on an individual basis.
Valid cases of proof by example
In certain circumstances, examples can suffice as logically valid proof.
Proofs of existential statements
In some scenarios, an argument by example may be valid if it leads from a singular premise to an existential conclusion (i.e. proving that a claim is true for at least one case, instead of for all cases). For example:
Socrates is wise.
Therefore, someone is wise.
(or)
I've seen a person steal.
Therefore, (some) people can steal.
These examples outline the informal version of the logical rule known as existential introduction, also known as particularisation or existential generalization:
Existential Introduction
(where denotes the formula formed by substituting all free occurrences of the variable in by .)
Likewise, finding a counterexample disproves (proves the negation of) a universal conclusion. This is used in a proof by contradiction.
Exhaustive proofs
Examples also constitute valid, if inelegant, proof, when it has also been demonstrated that the examples treated cover all possible cases.
In mathematics, proof by example can also be used to refer to attempts to illustrate a claim by proving cases of the claim, with the understanding that these cases contain key ideas which can be generalized into a full-fledged proof.

Beverly Kenney (January 29, 1932, Harrison, New Jersey – April 13, 1960, Greenwich Village, New York City) was an American jazz singer.
Early life
Kenney was born in Harrison, New Jersey on January 29, 1932, the second of Charles J. and Regina K. "Jean" (née Abrams) Kenney's three children.
Career
Kenney's career began as a birthday singer for Western Union. After moving to New York City, she recorded a demo tape in 1954 with Tony Tamburello (the demo was released in its entirety in 2006 under the title Snuggled on Your Shoulder). By the end of the year, she moved to Miami and worked regularly at the Black Magic Room. For several months she toured with Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey's Dorsey Brothers Orchestra before returning to New York. Kenney said "Tommy and Jimmy liked me, but they thought I was too much of a stylist for the band. After a few months on the road, I left, and returned to New York", where she sang in clubs with George Shearing, Don Elliott, and Kai Winding.
Her big break came in October 1955, when she was featured in a Jazz Benefit concert for Israel at Carnegie Hall, sharing the bill with Miles Davis, Art Blakey, Tito Puente, and Marian McPartland. An October 25, 1956 newspaper ad lists Kenney as appearing at the Playgoer Room at the Westnor restaurant in Westport, Connecticut. At 24 years old, Kenney was beginning to become a fixture of the New York Jazz scene. She earned a standing gig at Birdland with Lester Young, and upon her debut at New York's Basin Street Club, DownBeat critic Nat Hentoff praised her as compared to other artists. He said Kenney is “more flexible than Helen Merrill, swings more easily than Teddi King, and her musicianship and care for lyrics are far superior to Chris Connor's.”
From 1956 to 1960, Kenney recorded six albums, three for Royal Roost and three for Decca. Her first album, Beverly Kenney Sings for Johnny Smith (1956), recorded when she was 24 years old, with a quartet led by jazz guitarist Johnny Smith. She then began a residency at the Birdland jazz club accompanied by the Lester Young Quintet. Her television exposure consisted of one visit to The Steve Allen Show on May 18, 1958, performing the song she wrote "I Hate Rock 'n' Roll" and one appearance on Playboy's Penthouse, where Kenney coaxed host Hugh Hefner to sing "Makin' Whoopee" with her.
Steve Allen also wrote liner notes for her album Beverly Kenney Sings for Playboys (Decca, 1958) in which he commented, "A word to playboys: I would not recommend this album as Music to Make the Romantic Approach By. You're apt to get more interested in Beverly than the girl you're trying to impress."
In a review of her 1959 album Born to be Blue, editor Allan Gilbert, Jr. said of Kenney "...she has the ability to gently, huskily slur, warp and mould her phrasing to achieve rare individuality" and that she "could be tomorrow's big name."
Death and legacy
Kenney attempted suicide twice and then succeeded the third time with a combination of alcohol and Seconal on April 12, 1960, in a one-room apartment in the University Residence Hotel located at 45 East 11th Street in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York. Her father, Charles J. Kenney had dinner with her two nights earlier and said "everything seemed fine".
She remains a cult figure in Japan, where all of her albums have been reissued on CD and have remained in print on a relatively steady basis. SSJ Records in Japan released three collections of previously unreleased material: Snuggled on Your Shoulder (2006), Lonely and Blue (2007), and What Is There to Say? (2009). This first in the series, Snuggled on Your Shoulder, was reissued by Cellar Door Records in 2010; it features the SSJ Records release in its entirety plus bonus tracks from a discovered radio show. One track from Snuggled on Your Shoulder, "Tea for Two", was released on the Vintage music compilation, This is Vintage Now (2011).
Kenney's vintage 1957 recording of "It's a Most Unusual Day" from her album Beverly Kenney Sings For Playboys is the background song in a late 2021 Lincoln automobile television commercial.

A. Michael Noll (born 1939, Newark, New Jersey) is an American engineer, and professor emeritus at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California. He served as dean of the Annenberg School from 1992 to 1994. He was a very early pioneer in digital computer art and 3D animation and tactile communication.
Biography
Noll has a B.S.E.E. from Newark College of Engineering (now known as New Jersey Institute of Technology), an M.E.E. from New York University, and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.
Before joining the Annenberg School for Communication, Noll had a varied career in basic research, telecommunication marketing, and science policy. He worked in the AT&T Consumer Products and Marketing Department where he performed technical evaluations and identified opportunities for new products and services, such as teleconferencing and videotex.
He was Director of Technology Research and a Senior Affiliated Research Fellow at the Columbia Institute for Tele-information at Columbia University's Business School. He was affiliated with the Media Center at New York Law School, was a senior advisor to the Marconi Society, and was an adjunct faculty member of the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. He is an associate of the Quello Center at Michigan State University.
In the early 1970s, Noll was on the staff of the President's Science Advisor at the White House and was involved with such issues as computer security and privacy, computer exports, scientific and technical information, and educational technology.
From 1992 to 1994, Noll was dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication for an interim period. During this time he formulated a broader vision of communication that resulted in a merger of USC academic units that study communication. He joined the faculty of the Annenberg School as a professor of communications in 1984 and became emeritus in 2006.
The electrical-engineering honor society Eta Kappa Nu awarded him Honorable Mention as an Outstanding Young Electrical Engineer in 1970.
Work
Bell Labs in the early 1960s was extremely pioneering in the beginnings of digital computer art (A. Michael Noll), digital computer animation (Edward E. Zajac, Frank Sinden, and Kenneth C. Knowlton), and digital computer music (Max V. Mathews and John R. Pierce).
Noll spent nearly fifteen years performing basic research at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey in such areas as the effects of media on interpersonal communication, three-dimensional computer graphics and animation, human-machine tactile communication, speech signal processing, cepstrum pitch determination, and aesthetics.
Noll used a digital computer to create artistic patterns and formalized the use of random and algorithmic processes in the creation of visual arts. His initial digital computer art was programmed in the summer of 1962 at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, NJ, making him one of the early innovators of digital computer art.
In 1965 Noll, along with two other pioneers within the field of early computer art, Frieder Nake and Georg Nees in Germany, exhibited publicly their computer art. During April 1965, the Howard Wise Gallery in New York City exhibited Noll's computer art along with random-dot patterns by Bela Julesz. Later in 1965, Noll's digital computer art was exhibited along with the analogue computer art of Maughan Mason at the Fall Joint Computer conference in Las Vegas. Noll proposed in the 1960s that the digital computer might become a creative artistic medium. All of his digital art was programmed in FORTRAN and FORTRAN subroutine packages that he wrote.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Noll constructed interactive three-dimensional input devices and displays and a three-dimensional, tactile, force-feedback ("feelie") device (US patent 3,919,691 "Tactile Man-Machine Communications System" filed May 26, 1971, issued November 1, 1975). This device was the forerunner of today's virtual-reality systems, and Noll suggested its use as a way for the blind to "feel" computer graphics. He also demonstrated the potential of scanned raster displays for computer graphics. He was an early pioneer in the creation of stereoscopic computer-animated movies of four-dimensional hyper-objects, of a computer-generated ballet, and of computer-animated title sequences for TV and film.
His experiment comparing a computer-generated pattern with a painting by Mondrian was an early implementation of the Turing Test and an example of the use of digital computers in investigations of aesthetics.
Quotes
* "As the technology progresses, increasing numbers of scientists, animators, artists, and others will use the graphic capabilities of computers coupled with devices for producing visual output."
* “The computer may be potentially as valuable a tool to the arts as it has already proven itself to be in the sciences."
* “Computers … will become more readily accessible with the net result that many more people, including artists, will become computer oriented. In time this new artistic medium will be exploited to produce previously unknown effects combining color, depth, motion, and randomness in creative combinations.”
* “In the computer, man has created not just an inanimate tool but an intellectual and active creative partner that, when fully exploited, could be used to produce wholly new art forms and possibly new aesthetic experiences.”
* “… the end result, no matter through what medium it was produced, should be judged for its own artistic merit. … I am quite excited by the prospects for the new artistic effects and beauty which will surely result from creative collaborations between artists and the computer.”
* “What we really need is a new breed of artist-computer scientist.”
Publications
Noll has published over ninety professional papers, has been granted six patents, and is the author of ten books on various aspects of telecommunications, communications, and Bell Telephone Laboratories.
He has been a regular contributor of opinion and columnist pieces to newspapers and trade magazines with over 150 published. He has been quoted frequently about telecommunications and the telecommunication industry by the media. He has been a reviewer of classical music performances for the Classical New Jersey Society.

The Morton County WPA Bridge, near Richfield, Kansas, United States, is a stone multi-arch bridge that was built from 1936 to 1939 by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.
According to its NRHP nomination, it was deemed significant due to its use of distinctive construction methods which are no longer in use including "supported by a stone arch which is loaded by an earthen fill which in turn, is retained by stone spandrel walls." It was also credited for maintaining the "integrity of location, design, setting, materials, feeling and association."

A. J. W. Dawson was a Tyneside singer/songwriter and performer in the late 19th and early 20th century.
He wrote and performed a work titled “A Record Run” at a special dinner given by Wilson Worsdell Esq. J.P. M.I.M.E. to the retired officials and engine drivers of the N.E.R. Co., in Gateshead, on 11 February 1910
The song belongs to a surprisingly small group of North East humorous railway songs (remembering that the area was the birthplace of the Railways) and describes a journey from South Shields to Newcastle
A. J. W. Dawson published a six-page chapbook titled “A Record Run”, printed by the Tyne Printing Works Limited, a copy of which is held in the archives of Gateshead Council

Setting the Paces was the third full-length album by indie rock band BOAT, released in 2009.
Reception
Setting the Paces received largely positive reviews from critics. Allmusic's Tim Sendra describes the album as having "debts owed to Pavement, Television Personalities, and the Banana Splits, and with a bouncy energy that makes the album very easy to like." Pitchfork Media's David Bevan claims the songs give "way to a full-blast power chord workout and on to a chuggable chorus... At the center of it all is one gooey, delicious hook... Every song is irrepressible in its own right."

The term Puqudu or Piqudu (or in the Bible, Peqod) refers to a prominent Aramean tribe and its associated region in southern or eastern Babylonia. They lived along the eastern edge of Elam and in the area near Uruk and the Tigris. Their tribal name is sometimes spelled with an accent mark as Puqūdu, and the members of the tribe are sometimes referred to as Puqūdian, Puqūdians, or Puqudaeans (e.g. in the Nimrud Letters). Some older publications use Pukud.
The Puqudu, known from governmental archives of Assyria, were "prominent between the mid-8th century and 626 B.C.", although their presence is documented in Babylonia at least as early as the ninth century. It is not certain when they migrated into the area.
They appear to have been a loosely associated set of clans, forming alliances for war but not governed under any form of permanent centralized government. In common with other Aramean tribes of the area, including the Gambūlu, Ruʾa, and Gurasimmu, the Puqudu had multiple leaders at the same time. There is not enough surviving evidence to speak more specifically about their political organization. Their way of life appears to have been largely rural, with many caring for herds. The surviving records concerning Puqudu and other groups point to an ongoing tension between the largely rural Aramean tribes, including the Puqudu, and the rural elite of Assyria.
History
Tiglath-Pileser III, king of Assyria (745–722), conquered the Puqudu, and destroyed Hilimmu and Pillutu, two of their cities. He relocated many of the defeated Puqudu into other parts of his empire. Although incorporated into the Assyrian Empire, the Puqudu repeatedly rebelled against Assyria and engaged in warfare against Assyrian provincial governors and Assyrian allies in the late eighth century and well into the seventh.
From 721 to 710, Babylonia was ruled by Marduk-apla-iddina II, who successfully fought a war at the beginning of his reign to make it independent of Assyria and its ruler Sargon II (king of Assyria 721-705). In 710, Sargon defeated Marduk-apla-iddina and his coalition, which included the Puqudu.
Sargon integrated the Puqudu land into the Gambulu province in 710, but still found it necessary to carry out military expeditions, which were ultimately successful, against Bit-Yakin (a Chaldean tribe) and the Puqudu between 709 and 707. After the death of Sargon and the accession of his son Sennacherib (ruled 705–681), the Puqudu again participated in rebellions in 704 and 691.
From 652–648, a war broke out between Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria, and his rebellious brother Shamash-shum-ukin, governor of Babylon, who claimed the right to rule the entire empire. The Puqudu, along with other Aramean groups, sided with Shamas-shum-ukin, who was defeated and died in 648. Preserved letters indicate that during the war Puqudians managed to enter Uruk and take prisoners. However, as Ashurbanipal began to gain the upper hand, Puqudians were deported several times to other parts of the empire.
Two biblical references, both concerned with the destruction of Jerusalem in 587 by Babylon, make passing reference to the Puqudu. Spelled in Hebrew (which largely lacks vowels) as pqd, the Hebrew version of the name is now traditionally pronounced as Pekod. Ezekiel, interpreting the destruction of Jerusalem as judgment by God, says, "Assuredly, Oholibah, thus said the Lord God: I am going to rouse against you the lovers from whom you turned in disgust, and I will bring them upon you from all around – the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, [the people of] Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, all of them handsome fellows, governors and prefects, officers and warriors, all of them riding on horseback." Jeremiah mentions Pekod briefly as a region of Babylon in an oracle of judgment against Babylonia: "Advance against her – the land of Merathaim – / And against the inhabitants of Pekod; / Ruin and destroy after them to the last / – says the Lord – / Do just as I have commanded you."
The Babylonian emperor Neriglissar (reigned 560-556), was a member of the Puqudu tribe, and the son of the governor of the Puqudu district within the Babylonian Empire.

Henry "Sam" Chauncey, Jr. is a longtime administrator at Yale University. He has been credited in part with management of the volatile atmosphere on campus and in New Haven, Connecticut associated with the New Haven Black Panther trials.
Chauncey, a member of Yale College's class of 1957, was appointed special assistant to then Yale President Kingman Brewster, 1963–1977, in 1963. Chauncey had been a student at Groton School before Yale. Senior year he had worked in the University Secretary's office. He graduated with the Yale Class of 1957 and retired in 2000.
Chauncey is a descendant of Yale College's first graduate, and his father, Henry Chauncey, a graduate of Harvard University, was founder and head of the Educational Testing Service, and an important aide to James Bryant Conant, Harvard's president, 1933–1953, when that school expanded its admissions net. Chauncey did likewise for Brewster, with R. Inslee Clark, Jr., much as his father did for Conant in recruiting and admitting incoming classes more diverse and academically able than their predecessors.
Rather than the apocalyptic student riot that consumed Kent State University on May 4, 1970, Yale, under the leadership of Kingman Brewster on behalf of the faculty and Kurt Schmoke on behalf of the undergraduates, embraced and then managed the spirit of the protest. The protest lasted two days, May 1 and 2.
Brewster and Chauncey had met with Archibald Cox of Harvard to discuss what went awry April 15, 1970 in Cambridge, Massachusetts at a protest organized by an offshoot of the white radical group Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). The consensus was locking the gates to the university incited the violence, and it had done likewise at Columbia University. Abbie Hoffman vowed that Yale would burn May 1 after the experience at Harvard.
The transition to a co-ed from all-male Yale undergraduate student body was managed by Chauncey. "I wanted straight coeducation. I thought the Vassar thing, frankly, was stupid," he remarked about the plan to bring Vassar College to New Haven as a coordinate campus to Yale, akin to Radcliffe's relation to Harvard or Pembroke College to Brown or Barnard College to Columbia. The idea was dubbed "the Vassar flirtation" in the press. The Yale Corporation voted to accept women to Yale College on a full coeducational basis beginning in the fall of 1969.
Sam Chauncey also served as founder of the Yale Health Management Program at the Yale School of Public Health, a division of the Yale School of Medicine. Chauncey created the first health management program of its kind at Yale, and some argue the first of its kind at any major university. Students took classes with MBA and MPH students, sharing in the experiences of both school seamlessly, with working internships in relevant fields.

Chinthe ( (); (); ()) is the Burmese word for 'lion'. The leograph of Chinthe is a highly stylized lion commonly depicted in Burmese iconography and architecture, especially as a pair of guardians flanking the entrances of Buddhist pagodas and kyaung (or Buddhist monasteries).
Natural lion
In contrast to popular foreign beliefs, the Chinthe is not a mythical creature but instead an entirely natural lion, although often associated with Buddho-Burmese myths.
The Burmese leograph is related to other stylized lions in the Asian region, including the sing (สิงห์) of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and the simha (සිංහ) of Sri Lanka, where it is featured prominently on the Sri Lankan rupee. It is also related to East Asian leographs, such as the guardian lions of China, komainu of Japan, shisa of Okinawa and Snow Lion of Tibet.
Origins
The story of why the lions guard the entrances of pagodas and temples is given in the Mahavamsa:The princess Suppadevi of Vanga Kingdom (present day Bengal) had a son named Sinhabahu through her marriage to a lion, but later abandoned the lion who then became enraged and set out on a road of terror throughout the lands. The son then went out to slay this terrorizing lion. The son came back home to his mother stating he slew the lion, and then found out that he killed his own father. The son later constructed a statue of the lion as a guardian of a temple to atone for his sin.
In Burmese culture
The leograph of Chinthe appears as an element of Burmese iconography on many revered objects, including the palin (Burmese royal throne) and Burmese bells.
Predating the use of coins for money, brass weights cast in the shape of iconic animals like the Chinthe were commonly used to measure standard quantities of staple items.
In the Burmese zodiac, the lion sign is representative of Tuesday-born individuals.
The leograph is featured prominently on the successive post-independence State seals (including the current State Seal of Myanmar) and most paper denominations of the Burmese kyat, and its statues are found as guardian statues of most pagodas and temples.

Relation to Second World War Chindits
During the Second World War, the British Brigadier Orde Wingate was given command of forces charged with long-range penetration operations behind Japanese lines in Burma. At the suggestion of Captain Aung Thin of the Burma Rifles, Wingate decided to call this force "The Chinthes" (The Lions), a name which became corrupted to "The Chindits" and was so recorded in the annals of World War II.

Horst Fascher (born 5 February 1936) is a German music business figure who was a friend and business associate of the Beatles during their early career playing in Hamburg, Germany.
Biography
Early life
Horst Fascher was born in Hamburg, Germany, on 5 February 1936. His mother was a cleaning lady and his father was a seaman who fought in World War II, subsequently being held as a prisoner of war by the Soviet Union until 1951. As a young man, Fascher was a promising amateur boxer, becoming flyweight champion of West Germany. He had been expected to represent his country at the 1960 Olympics, but after accidentally killing a sailor in a street fight he served six months in prison and was given a lifetime ban from boxing. After his release, Fascher became involved in the emerging rock and roll scene around Hamburg's Reeperbahn, working as a barman and bouncer in the music clubs and managing groups.
The Beatles
When the Beatles (including original drummer Pete Best and bassist Stuart Sutcliffe) made their first trip to Germany in August 1960, Fascher befriended the young group, who played at the Indra Club and the Kaiserkeller. As they rose through the ranks of bands playing the Reeperbahn (making five trips in all over the next two-and-a-half years), Fascher usually managed to be working at the same clubs, and for the same boss, as the Beatles. They visited him at home, and he in turn kept troublemakers away from the band. The only favour Fascher asked was to be able to sing with them occasionally onstage, which was granted; Eddie Cochran's music was a common choice.
The Beatles (with Best now replaced by Ringo Starr, and Paul McCartney changing to bass when Sutcliffe departed) did not want to make their last Hamburg visit, at the end of 1962, preferring to stay in England to promote their new single, "Love Me Do", but were persuaded by manager Brian Epstein, via Horst Fascher, who recalled later "I had to give him thirty marks under the table to make him do it." Nonetheless, the band had a holiday residency at the Star-Club (which Fascher co-ran), through the New Year.
Fascher guested with the Beatles during their New Year's Eve show, which was recorded by another Liverpool musician, Ted "Kingsize" Taylor. Years later (in 1977), the tape was released commercially as Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962. A song from the album, "Hallelujah, I Love Her So", features Horst Fascher's vocals. Another song, "Be-Bop-A-Lula", features his brother Fred's vocals.
Fascher remained a friend and admirer of the band years after they became famous. Some of his stories about the band's Hamburg days (and his impressions of the young Beatles) have found their way into music biographies, including Philip Norman's Shout!. His own memoir was published in 2006.

A sports analyst is a person looking through technical, tactical, physiological, and psychological performance metrics working with the sports coach and sports science team to improve athlete performances. They will often use Video motion analysis to help with data collection. Sport commentators or journalists also analyse elements of sport performance, for media companies like ESPN, NBC Sports, CBS Sports Network, Turner Sports, and ABC.
A sports analyst may perform different jobs within the field and may even hold more than one position at once. A sports journalist reports to the public in the form of writing and includes information about sporting topics, events, and competitions. A sports commentator and sportscaster give play by play details of a specific sporting event and game. They also relay information necessary in order to understand the context of that specific sport. Notable sports commentator include Joe Buck, Brent Musburger, and Max Kellerman.
Sports analysts are typically former athletes and coaches from their respective sports. There are times where a sports analyst will cover a sport even though they have not played that sport previously. An example is Brad Daugherty, who played professional basketball but covers NASCAR racing.
A sports analyst's education may include a Bachelor of Journalism or sport communication and master's programs with concentrations in sports reporting. Common courses include news reporting, media ethics, sports psychology, and magazine writing.
The number of sports analyst jobs is predicted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to decrease by 9% between 2014 and 2024.

City of Gold (Marathi: Lalbaug Parel) is a 2010 Indian film released in both Hindi and Marathi. The film was Mahesh Manjrekar's 17th film, having previously directed critically acclaimed films such as Astitva and Viruddh... Family Comes First. It was adapted from Jayant Pawar's Marathi play, Adhantar, with Pawar going on to co-write the film's screenplay. The film explores the life of Mumbai's mill workers after the Mumbai mills shut down in response to the Great Bombay Textile Strike of the early 1980s. The film opened to mixed reviews, though it was commended for its themes, and acting. The name of the Marathi version of this film is Lalbaug Parel, while the Hindi version was released as City of Gold.
Plot
The film is the story of a family of mill workers in Mumbai. It follows the workers as politics and greed rise in Mumbai and exposes the collusion between the triumvirate of big business, the political establishment and the trade union leaders who ostensibly were charged with protecting the rights of the mill workers.
Baba Dhudu narrates his story to his fiance. He is a son of a mill worker and has two brothers, Naru and Mohan and a sister Manju. Along with his parents, they stay in a congested locality of Parel.
Mohan has a regular job as an accountant, while Naru and Baba are jobless. Naru is a local strongman and bashes anyone who crosses him or his friends. Baba aspires to be a professional playwright and spends time in writing, which his family despises as this does not bring any income for the family. His father is retired from the mill and fighting for his retirement dues from the mill which is on the verge of closing down. The mill is managed by the son-in-law of the owner Mr Khaitan, who is a very hard-nosed selfish person. His aim is the close-down of the mill and establishing a real estate business over the mill land, which is worth gold in today's market. In order to convert the mill into a commercial complex, he needs a NOC from the mill workers as well as their resignation letters.
Mill workers are adamant over their dues and are not willing to sacrifice their jobs. Rane and Govind are their leaders and Dr Sawant is the union leader and fights the legal battle for the mill workers. Govind is short-tempered and always willing to physically fight with the owners, while Rane is practical and feels legal recourse is the best way to get justice.
The mill workers are fighting for dues of six months and one fine day it is announced that the mill would be closed down. Mill workers go on strike and a local politician becomes involved.
Meanwhile, Naru gets involved with local don Parshya Bhai and starts running errands for him along with his friends. Mohan who is a hardcore cricket buff one fine day syphons off Rs. 25,000 from his company to bet on a match which he loses. Baba rescues him from the police after settling the dues by selling his kidney, unknown to his family. Manju becomes pregnant and is distraught when she discovers that her lover is already married. Her father gets a paralytic attack due to this and is bedridden. He requests Rane to marry his daughter, which he accepts.
The local politician intervenes and mill workers agree to give NOC, but not resignation and it is decided that a part of the mill would be restored. But the very night when the mill is supposed to resume, it is blown away by an explosion, presumably by the owner. Now nothing in hand, the mill workers sit on a strike. Things go from bad to worse and they start selling off their personal possessions to survive. Some of the ladies get into prostitution, while kids get into mugging. There is a constant face-off between owners and mill workers. In a fit of rage one fine day, Govind assaults the brother-in-law of the owner. He is enraged at this action and hires Parshya Bhai to kill Govind. Parshya Bhai assigns the task to Naru but does not tell him who the target is. Naru shoots Govind dead, only to realise later that he has shot down the father of his best friend 'Speedbreaker'. Naru goes into hiding. Later his father dies out of the shock of the news. Naru later confronts Parshya Bhai who tricked him by not paying his share of the contract. He kills him with the help of his friends. Naru is in turn killed by Speedbreaker and he takes over the gang of Parshya Bhai. The mill owner finally comes up with some cash and the mill workers give in and agree to sign required legal documents for a very small part of their original compensation.
Rane is distraught that just as the court is about to give its verdict, the owners have tricked them taking advantage of their desperate situation.
Sometime later Baba finally achieves his dream of a becoming a professional playwright and is about to take his mother to the first show of his play. His mother is overwhelmed by his success and after a long hard life, she finally sees some hope. When she reads his name in the newspaper she dies out of shock.
Baba finishes his narration and takes his fiance to meet all the characters he had narrated in his story. Rane is still delusional that he will win the legal battle, the rest of them have got their lives back on track and Speedbreaker runs his gang along with his friends.
Production
The director of the film Mahesh Manjrekar writes in the director notes:"When I took a sabbatical from Hindi cinema close to four years ago, I promised myself that if and only if an exceptional subject came my way would I venture back to do a Hindi film. Lalbaug Parel is that subject."After completing the script in 2007, Manjrekar decided to wait until he could find a producer who would be willing to do a film without musical numbers. Eventually, DAR Motion Pictures produced the film.
Legal troubles
After the film's release the family of Dutta Samant served Mahesh Manjrekar with legal notice, claiming that the film wrongly placed the blame for the mills' closure on Samant. They also objected to Manjrekar's portrayal of the mill workers' children, saying they were shown as "goons".

La Trêve Lake is a freshwater body of the southern part of Eeyou Istchee James Bay (municipality), in the administrative region of Nord-du-Québec, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
The surface of the lake is largely in the cantons of Daine and Guettard; in addition, Rita Bay (in the South) extends into the canton of La Ribourde. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second.
The hydrographic slope of La Trêve Lake is accessible via a forest road from the South and serving the western part of the lake; this road links to road 113 linking Lebel-sur-Quévillon to Chibougamau. The surface of "Lac la Trêve" is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Geography
This lake has a length of , a maximum width of and an altitude of . Of very deformed nature, this lake includes:
East side: Dussault Bay and Pichamobi Bay (which receives the waters of Dempster Creek, coming from the East);
Northwest side: Gilbert Bay, where the outlet of the lake is located, which empties into the bottom of a bay in the La Trêve River;
West side: Baie Geneviève;
South side: Rita Bay.
Note: The Geneviève and Rita bays are separated by a peninsula stretching Northeast on . The Gilbert and Geneviève bays are separated by a peninsula stretching Northeast on which encases Lake Gisèle. On the East side, Pichamobi Bay and Dussault Bay are separated by a peninsula that extends westward on .
The mouth of La Trêve Lake is located at the end of a bay on the North-West side, at:
east of the mouth of the La Trêve River (confluence with the Maicasagi River);
North of the mouth of the Maicasagi River (confluence with Maicasagi Lake);
North-East of the mouth of Goéland Lake (Waswanipi River);
Northeast of the mouth of Olga Lake (Waswanipi River);
Northeast of the village center of Waswanipi;

Pope Pius XII () created 56 cardinals in two consistories. On both occasions Pius tried to bring the membership of the College of Cardinals to 70, the maximum established by Pope Sixtus V in 1586. The death of one cardinal meant his first consistory brought the College to 69 members, but his second consistory, through the prompt addition of another name after a cardinal-designate died, brought the number of cardinals to 70.
Pius was elected in 1939 by a papal conclave in which 62 cardinals participated. The Second World War forced him to wait until 1946 to hold a consistory to create cardinals. He then waited seven years as the membership of the College fell to 46 before holding another consistory in 1953, and it had fallen to 53 when he died five and a half years later without holding another consistory.
Pius' cardinals included Angelo Roncalli, who succeeded him as Pope John XXIII. He created the first native-born Australian cardinal, and the first cardinals from Chile, China, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, and India; Teodósio de Gouveia was the first from Mozambique and the first cardinal to reside in Africa in the modern era. Those Pius named from Poland and Yugoslavia did not attend the consistory out of fear their governments would not allow them to return home.
By creating just four Italians out of 32 cardinals in 1946 and 10 of 24 in 1953, Pius transformed the geographic composition of the College of Cardinals. At the time of the conclave that elected him in 1939, 35 of the 62 cardinals were Italian. At his death in 1958, the Italians were 17 of 53. Over the same timespan, the number of non-Europeans grew from seven to 18.
18 February 1946
On 23 December 1945, Pope Pius XII announced he would create 32 cardinals at a consistory on 18 February 1946. The new cardinals came from 19 countries, with the number in the College of Cardinals from the Western Hemisphere growing from three to fourteen. Countries with their first cardinal included Chile, China, and Cuba; Mozambique got its first cardinal, though he was born in Portugal; Australia gained its first native-born cardinal. Only four were Italian. It was one of the largest groups of cardinals created at one time. Pius discussed the 70-member maximum, noting that it did not control his appointments, but said that he would adhere to it because he was already naming so many new cardinals. He said: "we have been anxious that the greatest number of races and peoples should be represented, so that this creation may portray in a living manner the universality of the church." The size of the College had not been as high as 70–the maximum established on 3 December 1586 by Pope Sixtus V–since the eighteenth century.
With this consistory, Italians became a minority in the College of Cardinals. When it was announced they were expected to hold 28 of the 70 places. The death of Cardinal Pietro Boetto on 31 January at the age of 74 changed the outcome of the consistory to 27 Italians out of 69. As a symbolic recognition of the end of World War II, two of the new cardinals, Bernard Griffin from Great Britain and Konrad von Preysing of Germany embraced when they met on 12 February in the Vatican. Agagianian, just 50, became the youngest member of the College, though his patriarch's title gave him precedence ahead of other cardinals created at this consistory. Of the 32, all were made cardinal priests but Bruno, a cardinal deacon.
The large number of new cardinals required moving the ceremony where the pope meets with the new cardinals from the papal apartments to the Hall of Benedictions, and for the public ceremony the papal throne was repositioned from the apse of St. Peter's Basilica to the steps of the Altar of Confession to allow for a larger crowd of spectators. Three of the new cardinals were unable to attend the ceremonies on 18 February: Johannes de Jong and Jules-Géraud Saliège were unable to travel to Rome because of illness, and József Mindszenty was having problems obtaining a visa to travel from Hungary. Mindszenty arrived for the public ceremony on 21 February, but José María Caro and Manuel Arteaga y Betancourt were suffering from influenza. The next day, when the new cardinals received their rings, Juan Guevara was sick as well. Arteaga and Guevara received their insignia in a private ceremony with Pius on 28 February. Anticipating he would never be healthy enough to travel to Rome, de Jong received his biretta in Utrecht on 28 February as well. Finally, Caro and Saliège received their insignia from Pius on 17 May. By then the number of cardinals had fallen to 68 with the death of one of the new cardinals, John J. Glennon, on 9 March.
12 January 1953
On 29 November 1952 Pope Pius XII announced he would create 24 new cardinals in a consistory on 12 January 1953. Eleven of them were Italian and the membership of the college would reach the maximum of 70, with 27 Italians. Two were thought to be virtual prisoners in their countries, Aloysius Stepinac in Yugoslavia and Stefan Wyszyński in Poland. Those from Ecuador and Colombia were those countries' first cardinals. Stepinac and Wyszyński chose not to travel to Rome, fearing they would not be allowed to reenter their countries. Another new cardinal was Angelo Roncalli, who became Pope John XXIII in 1958.
One of those Pius named, Carlo Agostini, died on 28 December at the age of 64. The next day, the Vatican announced Valerian Gracias would be made a cardinal, the first from India, allowing the College to reach its maximum membership of 70, with 26 of them Italian.
Reviving a custom that had been interrupted, Pius announced that he was granting the request of Catholic heads of state in four countries to serve as his legate in delivering the cardinal's biretta to six of them, either residential bishops in or papal nuncios to their country: Generalissimo Francisco Franco of Spain for Gaetano Cicognani, Benjamín de Arriba y Castro, and Fernando Quiroga y Palacios; the socialist President of France Vincent Auriol for Angelo Roncalli; the President of Portugal for Pietro Ciriaci; and President Luigi Einaudi of Italy for Francesco Borgongini Duca. At the consistory Pius sharply criticized Yugoslavia and in milder language Poland and said the honor he was showing to two of their citizens was meant to honor their countries as well.
After creating 23 cardinals of the order of cardinal priests and one cardinal deacon (Ottaviani) on 12 January 1953, Pope Pius three days later gave seventeen of them their red galeros, sixteen their titular church assignments, and Ottaviani his deaconry.
When Pius died five years later, his failure to make Giovanni Battista Montini a cardinal at this conclave was much discussed. Though still in his fifties, Montini appeared to be groomed as Pius' successor and had long been his right hand at the Secretariat of State. Pius appointed him Archbishop of Milan in 1954, and Montini even received some votes at the 1958 conclave, where his prospects would have been very good had he been a cardinal. Instead he had to wait for the next conclave in 1963 to be elected Pope Paul VI.

Asian-German Sports Exchange Program (AGSEP), is a non-governmental organisation operating in the development sector in Sri Lanka with a partner office in Essen, Germany. AGSEP describes itself as Government Associated Organisation because of its consultancy status to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Disaster Relief Services and the Ministry for Rehabilitation & District Development.
Profile
AGSEP works mainly with internship students from leading German universities doing their undergraduate and postgraduate studies in the fields of economics, political science, social science, engineering, sport and other disciplines. The Asian German Sports Exchange Programme (A.G.S.E.P.)has been conducting sport events and international exchanges between Sri Lankan and European sport teams since 1989. The organisation is based in Marawila, in rural western Sri Lanka, and was founded by the current CEO of the programme, Dr. Dietmar Döring, who at that time was the national coach of the table tennis team. Dr. Döring saw an opportunity to use sport events as an avenue to enhance tourism and the relationships between estranged ethnic communities in Sri Lanka. The philosophy of A.G.S.E.P. is that sport is an ideal way of connecting people and transcending social, cultural, ethnic and religious cleavages. Sport provides a neutral platform for all participants, who are able to experience and learn from each other in a playful and open atmosphere.
AGSEP's mission it to assist the divided ethnic groups of Sri Lanka to find peace by exposing the children of the island to children of other ethnic groups as part of sporting events.
History
The German social education worker Dietmar Doering founded AGSEP while he was a national coach for the table tennis team of Sri Lanka.
Since 1989, against the background of a long-lasting civil war, AGSEP has promoted integrative sport events as peaceful intergroup sport encounters that popularise social values such as intercultural togetherness, respect, courage, commitment, and appreciation through active participation and exchange. Integrative sport events are planned, organised, implemented and staged in co-operation with the three major ethnic groups on the island, Sinhalese, Tamils, and Muslims.
Activities
Tsunami relief mission

Charlotte E. Maguire (September 1, 1918 – December 6, 2014) was the first woman medical doctor in Orlando, Florida, and opened the first pediatric practice run by a woman in Orlando in 1946. She was one of the founders of the University of Florida College of Medicine as well as the Florida State University College of Medicine. Maguire was denoted as a “Great Floridian” in a 2013 ceremony and was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame posthumously in 2015.
Biography
Charlotte C. Edwards was born on September 1, 1918 in Indiana. Her family had relocated from Illinois because of her mother's illness and she grew up in Orlando, Florida. When her mother died, Edwards was seven years old and her grandparents helped her father raise her. Edwards wanted to become a physicist and when she won a scholarship to study chemistry and physics at the University of Heidelberg, she left for Germany. In 1938, at her father's insistence, she was evacuated due to World War II and after returning to the United States attended Memphis State Teacher's College, graduating in 1940. During her education, she worked as a switchboard operator for long-distance calls to pay her way through school. When she completed her teaching degree, she applied to enter medical school in Memphis, and though she was accepted, three days later, she was dismissed and told that another student needed the place. Unable to enter medical school due to the bias against admitting women, her grandfather intervened and gained her admittance to the University of Arkansas. Edwards completed her Doctor of Medicine degree in 1944 and returned to Orlando.
Career
Edwards was hired as the first woman doctor in Orlando at the Orange General Hospital. Two years later, in 1946, she opened the first private practice in pediatrics run by a woman, providing medical care for children with disabilities and free service for those unable to afford care. She was appointed, because she was a recent graduate, by President John J. Tigert, as the only woman to serve on the Founders Committee to develop a college of medicine at the University of Florida. Then in 1947, she was appointed to serve as the chief of staff for the Children's Home Society in the Central Florida Division. In 1948, Edwards married a local lawyer and citrus grower, Raymer Francis Maguire Sr., who was a single father and 28 years older than she.
The following year, Maguire was appointed as the director of the Children's Health Clinic of Orlando and in 1952, she was named president of the Florida Pediatric Society, as the first woman to achieve the distinction. Throughout the 1950s, Maguire continued in these varying enterprises, leaving the Children's Home Society in 1956 and serving as a delegate to the World Health Conference held in London in 1957. In 1960, her husband died and Maguire was left with his citrus business. She returned to school to learn how to cultivate, manage and market the five citrus groves and earned her certification from Florida Southern College. In 1965, she joined Mercy Hospital in Orlando as the chief of the pediatrics department, a post which she served until 1968. At that time, she closed her private practice and discontinued actively managing the citrus farm, moving to Tallahassee to take over the directorship of the Florida Crippled Children's Commission.
For a time in the 1970s, she served as the assistant secretary of health and scientific affairs in the Nixon administration for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in Atlanta, but returned to Florida in 1975, taking over as medical services coordinator of the Health and Rehabilitative Services Department in Tallahassee. Maguire worked on the clinical staff of the pediatrics department of the University of Florida from 1980 to 1987, and then retired in 1988.
Philanthropy
In 1999 Maguire donated $1 million to Florida State University (FSU) to create the Charlotte Edwards Maguire Eminent Scholar Chair for the Program in Medical Sciences and the following year became an advocate, lobbying for the creation of a medical school at FSU. FSU opened their medical school in 2000 and she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree on February 14, 2002 at the College of Medicine Administration Building. In 2004, she provided 2 students with full-tuition scholarships to FSU and the following year, donated another $1 million to create a geriatrics program at the 2005 ceremony naming “The Charlotte Edwards Maguire Medical Library” in her honor. In 2010, she donated $1 million to the retirement home where she had lived since 1991 to create the Maguire Center for Lifelong Learning which houses an auditorium, computer lab, virtual library, and a bistro. She also established a scholarship fund for the home's employees to further their nursing education.
In a ceremony in 2013, Governor Rick Scott bestowed the title “Great Floridian” on Maguire at the atrium of the FSU College of Medicine.
Maguire died on 6 December 2014 at Westminster Oaks Community in Tallahassee. She was posthumously elected to the Florida Women's Hall of Fame in 2015.

Hydririni is a tribe of the species-rich subfamily Spilomelinae in the pyraloid moth family Crambidae.
Description
Adult Hydririni are narrow- to broad-winged moths. Many species exhibit an inconspicuous wing pattern of brown and ochre colours, whereas species like Choristostigma roseopennalis (Hulst, 1886) can be rather colourful.
The tribe is characterised by two synapomorphies: the female genitalia have an appendix bursa on the corpus bursae (as found in Pyraustinae), and the male genitalia of most Hydririni exhibit one or more hair scale patches on the central anterior edge of the abdominal sternite 8.
Apart from this, the morphology of the genitalia is rather heterogeneous: in the male genitalia, the valves are slender to broad, and the uncus and gnathos range from well-developed to reduced. The genera Choristostigma, Hydriris, Nehydriris and Rhectothyris have lobar processes with a field of long, thin hair-pencils on the dorsolateral tegumen as well as a phallus with a long caecum and a straight or hooked cornutus.
In the female genitalia, two general types of signa are observed in the corpus bursae: the "ediacaroid" signum (sensu Mally et al. 2019) has the transverse axis more or less reduced, and the signum is elongated and zipper-shaped to nearly circular; the second type is formed by a circle of radiating spines. In Ommatospila, both signum types occur together.
Hydririni are one of the four tribes that form the paraphyletic "non-euspilomeline" group, with the "euspilomeline" clade nested within. The "non-euspilomeline" tribes are characterised by plesiomorphic characters shared with the sister group of Spilomelinae, the Pyraustinae. These plesiomorphic characters include the absence of a longitudinal sclerotized strip on the pleural membranes of the male abdominal segment 8, a straight or concave costa of the valves and an evenly sclerotized phallus apodeme in the male genitalia, as well as the "ediacaroid" signum and an appendix bursa in the female genitalia.
The morphology and chaetotaxy of Hydririni larvae has not been scientifically described.
Food plants
Recorded food plants of Hydririni larvae are predominantly Sapindaceae: Allophylus psilospermus, A. racemosus, Paullinia bracteosa, P. costaricensis, P. faginea, P. fuscescens, P. grandifolia, P. turbacensis, Serjania atrolineata, S. mexicana, S. rhombea, S. schiedeana, S. valerioi, and Urvilea ulmacea. A single case of feeding on the Fabaceae, Senna obtusifolia is recorded for a Costa Rican specimen of Lamprosema, and the young larvae of Hydriris ornatalis feed on the leaf undersides of Ipomoea batatas (Convolvulaceae) and related plants, whereas older larval instars skeletonize the leaves.
Distribution
Hydririni in its current composition contains mostly American taxa, with the majority of them described from tropical Central and South America. Lamprosema contains many Old World species that are misplaced in this genus.
Systematics
The tribe Hydririni was proposed in 1982 by Joël Minet, who originally placed it in the crambid subfamily Glaphyriinae. Minet included only the type genus Hydriris. Minet's original placement of the tribe in Glaphyriinae is likely due to homplastic characters shared by both groups, like the spatulate scales of the hindwings and the spinose signa in the corpus bursae of the female genitalia.
A phylogenetic study based on gene sequences and morphological data found the sampled specimens of Hydriris, Gonocausta, Lamprosema and Syllepis to form a monophyletic group that is the sister group to all other Spilomelinae investigated in that study. Based on morphological congruities, the authors placed four additional genera in this tribe, so that altogether eight genera, comprising 104 species, are currently placed in Hydririni:
Choristostigma Warren, 1892 (synonym Namangania Amsel, 1952)
Gonocausta Lederer, 1863
Hydriris Meyrick, 1885 (synonyms Antiercta Amsel, 1956, Hyperectis Meyrick, 1904, Spanista Lederer, 1863)
Lamprosema Hübner, 1823 (misspelling Lamphosema Schaus, 1940)
Nehydriris Munroe, 1974
Ommatospila Lederer, 1863 (synonym Thelda Walker, 1866)
Rhectothyris Warren, 1890
Syllepis Poey, 1832

Jonathan Hill was born in Margate, East Kent, England, on 30 March 1976. He is a British theologian and the author of several books that present a complex analysis of the history of Christianity and the history of Christian theology in a global perspective, with a particular focus on the expression, preservation, and change of human ideas over time. His books are written in an engaging and humorous style. The books are richly illustrated and easily accessible. His field of academic research deals with philosophical theology and seventeenth-century philosophy, particularly Leibniz.
Studies
Jonathan Hill has a first class degree in philosophy and theology (top of year) from Oxford University. He also has a Master of Philosophy in Theology, also from Oxford, and a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the National University of Singapore. He has worked as an independent freelance author, editor and writer since leaving Oxford in 1997. Jonathan Hill has also worked at Sky News as a subtitler since leaving Oxford University. He joined the Exeter University's Theology and Religion department as lecturer in Philosophy of Religion in 2013.
Books
Hill's work has been noted for his in-depth knowledge of theology and philosophy and his ability to make complex subjects accessible to all.
Apart from his published research he has written a number of books intended to introduce the history of theology and philosophy of religion to a wider audience. He has also given two series of public talks on Gnosticism, and on ancient mystery cults.
Jonathan Hill's books include The History of Christian Thought, 2003, Faith in the Age of Reason, 2004, What Has Christianity Ever Done for Us? (How It Shaped the Modern World, 2005, The Lion Handbook to the History of Christianity published in US as Zondervan Handbook to the History of Christianity (The History of Christianity), The Big Questions, 2007 and The Crucible of Christianity, 2010.
The Crucible of Christianity has been republished both as "Christianity: How a Tiny Sect From a Despised Religion Came to Dominate the Roman Empire" (Minneapolis: Fortress, 2010) and again by Lion in 2014, without pictures, as Christianity: the First 400 Years.
He is also the author of the books "The Metaphysics of Incarnation" and "The Author's Voice" are co-edited with Anna Marmodoro, both are academic volumes published by Oxford University Press.
The Big Questions, published by Lion in 2007, is a historical review of how Christians have tackled the "big questions". Hill notes in his introduction that there does “not seem to be anything like ‘the' Christian view on anything at all, even fairly fundamental things such as the nature of God.” Hill's approach was criticised by one reviewer, Bill Muehlenberg, who says that, although the line between orthodoxy and heresy is "wobbly", theologians have the task of defining the parameters of theological orthodoxy. Muehlenberg adds that Hill's book is intended to help the reader explore the depth and nuance of the "big questions" but gives too many options to the believer, and does not provide guidance as to which path to take.
The History of Christian Thought This book is an introduction to the lives of the great theologians, from antiquity to the present, who shaped the history of Christianity. It examines the ideas/writings of those people who had a great influence on the development of Christian thought and gives an introduction to the various theological movements from the Church Fathers through the Byzantine Empire, the Middle Ages, and the Reformation, to modern history and up to the present day.
What Has Christianity Ever Done for Us?: How it Shaped the Modern World. In this book Hill covers aspects of the influence that Christianity has had on Western culture. He shows how Christianity influenced different aspects of everyday life. He shows the often hidden and obscure/unexpected connections and the way that Christianity has influenced many aspects of arts, education, society and history. The book also describes events and people in history that have affected how we think in a way that we often take for granted.
The Lion Handbook to the History of Christianity published in 2007, and published in the US under the title Zondervan Handbook to the History of Christianity, gives a presentation about how Christian theology and the Christian church has developed around the world in the last 2000 years, including the Christian missionary movement in Asia, Africa and South America, resulting in the fact that today the Christian Church includes a third of the world's population. He describes the place of Christianity in history, philosophy, culture and thought.
The main body of text, written by Jonathan Hill in a rich, narrative style, covers the main history of Christianity. There are 44 in-depth entries written by other experts and co-authors who wrote one or two pages on topics such as monasticism, the Inquisition, Darwinism, the arts, education, society, spirituality and ethics and other subjects that have been important in the development of the Christian Church. The book is illustrated with photos, maps, illustrations and diagrams.
Hill's Dictionary of Theologians to 1308, published in 2009 by James Clark Ltd. is a guide to over 300 significant theologians in the Western and Eastern traditions. It also includes notable schismatics and heretics. It was described by John G. Bales of the Westminster Seminary in California as "remarkably comprehensive" and "unique in its scope and scholarship".
Translations
Some of Hill's works, such as The History of Christian Thought has been translated into other languages too, for example into Swedish. Luther's biographer Per Beskow translated the Swedish edition. Beskow added extra details about specifically Swedish issues. The book is extremely popular in Sweden.

Kwyet Kinks is the third EP by the Kinks, released in September 1965. Unlike most of their other EPs, it contained all exclusive tracks and all were original compositions.
The EP represented a significant departure as hinted at by the play on words title as all four tracks are "quieter" than the typical early Kinks rock sound, particularly lead track "Wait Till the Summer Comes Along", sung by Dave Davies with prominent acoustic guitar and a clear country or folk influence. The most well known track is "A Well Respected Man" which was the first real example of the social commentary and a songwriting style which would come to be associated with Ray Davies and the Kinks.
"A Well Respected Man" was released as a single in the US in October 1965 (b/w "Such a Shame") where it reached no. 13. Following the success of the similar "Dedicated Follower of Fashion" it was also released as a single in mainland Europe in 1966.
In the US, the tracks were included on the Kinkdom album (released November 1965). All four tracks were not available on another official Pye release in the UK, however three of the tracks (excluding "Such a Shame") were included on the budget Marble Arch compilation LP Well Respected Kinks in 1966 and "Such a Shame" appeared on that LP's follow up Sunny Afternoon in 1967. The EP was made available on CD in 1998 as part of the EP Collection boxed set. The tracks are currently available as bonus tracks on the CD reissue of Kinda Kinks.

Bystrowiella is an extinct genus of bystrowianid reptiliomorph from upper Middle Triassic (Ladinian age) deposits of Kupferzell and Vellberg, northern Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It was first named by Florian Witzmann, Rainer R. Schoch and Michael W. Maisch in 2008, from a complete osteoderm fused with tip of neural spine (SMNS 91034, the holotype), partial osteoderms (SMNS 91036, 91037) and vertebrae (SMNS 81698, 81871–81874, 81876, 81877, 81879). The type species is Bystrowiella schumanni. The genus is named in honour of Dr. Alexey Bystrow, a Russian paleontologist and the species in honour of Schumann family. Bystrowiellas the closest relative was Synesuchus.

"Forever and for Always" is a song co-written and performed by Canadian country music singer Shania Twain and it was the third country single from her fourth studio album Up! (2002). The song was written by her then-husband Robert John "Mutt" Lange and Twain. The single was released in the United States radio on April 7, 2003. The video debuted on Country Music Television on April 26, 2003. The song was also used for Febreze: Scentstories promotion, in which Twain took part. In 2006, "Forever and for Always" was certified gold for 500,000 digital downloads in the U.S. by the RIAA.
"Forever and for Always" was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2004, Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance; however, it lost in both categories. The song was also named Song of the Year at both the 2004 BMI Country Songwriter Awards and 2004 European BMI Awards (validated only for Shania Twain's shares, Mutt's shares are ASCAP-controlled).
Background
Twain said there is something inspirational to her about people who start relationships when they are kids, and are still in love when they are older. Twain really enjoyed doing the video for the song, because she was able to realize that visually. She said it is one of her favorite songs.
In December 2019, during the Let's Go! residency in Las Vegas, Twain revealed for the first time that the song had been recorded by her friend Prince, but that his version was never released and instead remained part of his private collection. The performance was Twain's first of "Forever And For Always" in over 15 years and was dedicated to the late singer.
Composition
"Forever and for Always" is performed in the key of G major in time following a chord progression of G–G2–C–D, and Twain's vocals span from G3 to E5. The song moves at a tempo of 86 beats per minute.
Music video
The music video for "Forever and for Always" was shot at Bethells Beach in New Zealand in March 2003. It was directed by Paul Boyd, who shot her "When You Kiss Me" video around the same time also in New Zealand. It debuted on Country Music Television (CMT) on April 26, 2003. The video shows two children at the beach together, then it shows them as teens, and eventually seniors, visualizing the theme of the song of staying together forever. Scenes of Twain at the beach are intercut throughout the video. The video was released with both the 'red' and 'green' versions, with each also having an 'all performance' video of only Twain at the beach. The video released a 'blue' version internationally as well. The video won the Female Video of the Year Award at the 2004 CMT Flameworthy Awards, and was nominated for Video of the Year at the 2003 Canadian Country Music Awards, but lost to another song by Twain, "I'm Gonna Getcha Good!". The video is available on select singles, and the DVD-Audio version of Up!.
Critical reception
Billboard magazine contrasted the song against the previous two singles, saying it "relies less on cutesy gimmicks (and exclamation marks) and focuses thematically on steadfast love," while comparing it to Shania's earlier singles "From This Moment On" and "You're Still the One". About.com ranked the song 95th for the top 100 pop songs of 2003.
Chart performance
"Forever and for Always" debuted on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart the week of April 12, 2003, at number 60. The single spent 26 weeks on the chart and climbed to a peak position of number four on September 6, 2003, where it remained for one week. "Forever and for Always" became Twain's 14th top-10 single and 19th top-20 single.
On the adult contemporary chart, "Forever and for Always" debuted at number 30 the week of May 10, 2003. The single spent 77 weeks on the chart and slowly climbed to a peak position of number one on November 15, 2003, where it remained for six non-consecutive weeks. "Forever and for Always" became Twain's third number one, sixth top-10 single and seventh consecutive top-20 single.
"Forever and for Always" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 on May 24, 2003, at number 75. It spent 23 weeks on the chart and peaked at number 20 on September 6, 2003, becoming Twain's fourth-most-successful single on the chart. The single reached number 17 on the airplay chart. "Forever and for Always" became Twain's fourth top-20 single and ninth top-40 single.
"Forever and for Always" proved to be successful internationally, becoming Twain's fifth biggest single in the UK. It debuted on June 14, 2003, at its peak at number six. This made it her seventh consecutive, eighth overall, top-10 single. It remained on the entire chart for 10 weeks. In all, "Forever and for Always" hit the top-10 in six countries: Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Romania, and the UK.

Compound interest treasury notes were emissions of the United States Treasury Department authorized in 1863 and 1864 with aspects of both paper money and debt. They were issued in denominations of , , , , and . While they were legal tender at face value, they were redeemable after three years with six percent annual interest compounded semi-annually. In the absence of efficient investment banks, the hybrid nature of these instruments allowed the government to directly distribute debt by paying the notes out to creditors as legal tender, and then relying on interest-seeking parties to eventually remove them from circulation in order to redeem them with interest at maturity. Thus, in theory, the notes did not contribute to monetary inflation as did the greenbacks.
At the time of their issue, investors were accustomed to receiving interest via semi-annual coupons. The compound interest notes were an innovation in that they paid interest only at maturity but compensated for the lack of immediate coupons by paying an escalated amount of interest for each six-month period. Each note presents an ornate table on the reverse containing details of the interest calculation.

David Spangler (December 2, 1796 – October 18, 1856) was an American lawyer and politician who served two terms as a U.S. Representative from Ohio from 1833 to 1837.
Biography
Born in Sharpsburg, Maryland, Spangler moved with his parents to Zanesville, Ohio in 1802. He attended public schools and worked at the blacksmith's trade before engaging in mercantile pursuits. Spangler then studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1824. He commenced practice in Zanesville.
He was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the state house of representatives in 1830. He then moved to Coshocton, Ohio in 1832 and continued to practice law. Spangler was elected as an Anti-Jacksonian to the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Congresses (March 4, 1833 – March 3, 1837). He declined candidacy for renomination in 1836 and for the nomination for Governor of Ohio in 1844.
Death
Spangler died in Coshocton on October 18, 1856 and was interred in South Lawn Cemetery.

Eye of Doom is an adventure module for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, published by TSR in 1996.
Plot summary
In Eye of Doom, the player characters find their way to the small village of Cumbert (which lies above an underground complex housing a hive of beholders). The adventurers are quickly ambushed by members of the Unblinking Eye, a cult of humans in the village who are dedicated to serving the interests of the beholders beneath them. In order to progress further through the scenario, the players must infiltrate the Unblinking Eye cult.
Publication history
In 1996, TSR published Eye of Pain, the first part of a trilogy designed by Thomas Reid that featured the giant floating eye known in AD&D as the beholder. The second part, Eye of Doom, was published the same year, a 32-page softcover book with artwork by Dana Andrews, Stephen A. Daniele, Greg Kerkman, Robert Lazzaretti, and Arnie Swekel.
Reid's final installment of the trilogy, Eye to Eye, was also published in 1996.
Reception
In Issue 13 of Arcane, Paul Pettengale recalled that the prequel to this adventure, Eye of Pain, was "less than impressive" and then opined that Eye of Doom was no better. He called the central plot device that forces the player characters to infiltrate the Unblinking Eye cult "somewhat improbable, given that members of the group know who they are (having recently ambushed them and all)." Pettengale also did not like the final scene, which is a cliffhanger for the next installment of the adventure. He concluded by giving Eye of Doom a very poor rating of only 3 out of 10, saying, "Unfortunately, this series, thus far, has been a waste of a great foe - the beholder is a unique monster in AD&D, and one that deserves far, far better than this."

Ira "Irl" Tubbs (February 12, 1887 – February 9, 1970) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Superior State Teachers College—now known as the University of Wisconsin–Superior (1923–1925, 1928–1929), the University of Miami (1935–1936), and the University of Iowa (1937–1938).
Playing and coaching career
Tubbs played college football at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri. He was a quarterback and end for William Jewell in the late 1910s.
After graduation, Tubbs coached for two years in Missouri high schools before taking a coaching job at the University of Wisconsin–Superior. He was in Wisconsin for nine years from 1922 to 1930, although he was only able to coach for five seasons due to attacks of Malta fever.
At Wisconsin–Superior, Tubbs served as both athletic director and a coach of football and hockey. He coached from 1923 to 1925 and again in 1928 and 1929, leading his school to football championships his last two seasons. Tubbs was a renowned inventor, developing improvements to athletic equipment such as a special inverted air valve for a football and elastic padding for football pants.
Tubbs resigned from Wisconsin–Superior in 1930 after another bout of health problems and moved to Miami. While he was recovering there in 1935, the head football coaching job at the University of Miami opened, and Tubbs was hired to coach the Hurricanes. Tubbs coached the Hurricanes for two seasons in 1935 and 1936, where he compiled an 11–5–2 record. In both seasons, his Hurricane teams bowed out as potential hosts for New Year's Day bowl games.
Tubbs was then hired as the 14th head football coach at the University of Iowa. He coached two seasons at Iowa in 1937 and 1938. He had a record of just 2–13–1 at Iowa, with his wins coming over Bradley and Chicago. Tubbs' tenure at Iowa is best distinguished by his coaching of players who would star for Iowa's 1939 team, nicknamed the "Ironmen". Some of the players Tubbs coached included Nile Kinnick, an all-Big Ten Conference selection in 1937, and Erwin Prasse, an all-conference end in 1938.
Tubbs was inducted into the University of Wisconsin–Superior Athletics Hall of Fame in 1963.

Petra Hinz (born 10 June 1962 in Essen) is a German politician and impostor. She is a member of the SPD. Since 2005, Hinz has been an MP of the German Bundestag. She resigned from her Bundestag seat after a CV scandal with effect of 1 September 2016.
Biography
Hinz left school with a university of applied sciences entrance qualification in 1983, and afterwards completed a year of internship at a local bank (Sparkasse) and a vocational training as a presenter from 1985 to 1987. From 1999 to 2003 she worked as a real estate manager. Hinz has been a SPD member since 1980 and worked for the party since 1982 in different positions, such as vice district chairwoman. From 1989 to 2005 she was a member of the Essen city council.
CV scandal
Hinz made headlines after allegations that she bullied her employees and faked essential parts of her curriculum vitae (CV), falsely claiming that she took her A-levels in 1984 and studied Law and Political Science for ten years from 1985 to 1995. Hinz admitted that she faked her CV. She resigned from her Bundestag mandate only after growing public pressure on 24 August 2016, but because of a formal error her request was considered as preliminary invalid by the Bundestag administration. On 30 August, it was reported that the resignation of her Bundestag seat with effect of 1 September 2016 was now formally accepted. Hinz also announced that she will resign from the SPD party until 5 September 2016, after the party had initiated internal proceedings against her. The case of Petra Hinz was viewed as a "disaster" for the SPD party.

Josef Triebensee (Trübensee) (November 21, 1772 Třeboň - April 22, 1846 Prague) was a Bohemian composer and oboist.
He studied composition with Albrechtsberger and oboe with his father, Georg Triebensee (January 28, 1746-June 14, 1813). He served in the private orchestra of Prince Schwarzenberg, and from 1782 to 1806 as first oboist of the Austrian Emperor's Harmonie (wind band). Concurrently, he also served as principal oboist at the Nationaltheater of Vienna. Other associations included second oboist at the Kärntnertortheater, Kapellmeister to Prince Liechtenstein's Harmonie at Feldsberg, the private orchestra of Count Hunyady (from 1811), a theater composer in Brno, and from 1816 to his retirement in 1836, director of the Prague Opera where he succeeded composer Carl Maria von Weber. Unlike Weber, his operas found little success.
Triebensee was the second oboist, with Olivier Hue, at the Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna in 1791 when he played the premiere of Mozart's Die Zauberflöte—explaining the peculiar difficulty of the second oboe parts in that work.
Triebensee's most important compositions were two sets of Harmoniemusik, the second appearing in 32 installments of ten or more movements. He wrote 12 comic operas for Vienna and Prague as well as vocal, orchestral, and chamber works.

Illuvium is material displaced across a soil profile, from one layer to another one, by the action of rainwater. The removal of material from a soil layer is called eluviation. The transport of the material may be either mechanical or chemical. The process of deposition of illuvium is termed illuviation. It is a water-assisted transport in a basically vertical direction, as compared to alluviation, the horizontal running water transfer. The resulting deposits are called illuvial deposits. Cutans are a type of illuvial deposit.
Illuvium includes organic matter, silicate clay, and hydrous oxides of iron and aluminum.
Illuvial deposits of clays, oxides, and organics accumulate in subsoil as distinctive soil horizons classified as "B horizons" or "zones of illuviation".
Mechanical illuviation
When percolating rain water reaches a drier soil horizon, water from the suspension is removed by capillary action of microchannels, leaving fine deposits (cutans) oriented along percolation macrochannels.
Examples
Mesara Plain, Crete, Greece
Chemical illuviation
Transport of soil solutes is termed leaching. Soluble constituents are deposited due to differences in soil chemistry, especially soil pH and redox potential.

Major-General Sir Thomas Owen Marden (15 September 1866 – 11 September 1951) was a British Army officer, active during the Second Boer War and World War I, where he commanded a battalion of the Welsh Regiment, a brigade, and finally the 6th Division. Following the war, he commanded a British occupying force in Turkey during the Chanak Crisis in the early 1920s.
Early career
Born in Bath, Somerset, England, Marden attended Berkhamsted School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before joining the Cheshire Regiment as a lieutenant on 25 August 1886. He saw service with his regiment in Burma from 1887 to 1889, during the colonial campaigns following the Third Anglo-Burmese War, and was promoted to captain on 15 May 1896. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, he was posted on special duty as District Commandant in South Africa. Leaving London in February 1900, he was senior officer in command of reinforcements on board the SS Cheshire for the journey, and arrived in South Africa the following month. He was mentioned in despatches for service during the war. He returned to England to attend the Staff College, Camberley, graduating in 1902 and posted to staff duties in India as a deputy assistant adjutant-general. In 1904 he was posted to the Directorate of Training at the War Office, moving to a staff posting in South Africa in 1910.
Whilst on staff duties, in 1905, he had been promoted to a majority in the Northumberland Fusiliers, and in 1908 transferred into the Welsh Regiment. In 1912 he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel, and left South Africa in order to take up command of the 1st Battalion, Welsh Regiment.
World War I
At the outbreak of World War I, Marden's battalion was stationed in India; it was brought back to the United Kingdom and allocated to the 84th Brigade of the 28th Division, which was to be sent to the Mediterranean. Whilst passing through France, units of the division were used to support operations on the Western Front, and Marden was wounded by shrapnel whilst commanding his battalion at the Second Battle of Ypres.
Later in 1915, he was promoted to command the 114th Infantry Brigade, part of the 38th (Welsh) Division, a Kitchener's Army formation. He commanded the brigade until mid-1917, during which time it fought at the Battle of the Somme, where it took heavy losses, and on the first day of the Battle of Passchendaele. In August 1917 he was again promoted, this time to become General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 6th Division, which he commanded at the Battle of Cambrai and in the Hundred Days Offensive in the latter half of 1918. Following the Armistice with Germany, he commanded a brigade in the occupying British Army of the Rhine (BAOR).
For his services during the war, he was mentioned in despatches eight times, and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath and a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, as well as being made an officer of the French Légion d'Honneur and the Russian Order of St. Vladimir (fourth class, swords), and awarded the Croix de Guerre with palm.
Later service
In 1920, Marden was given command of the British division occupying Constantinople. During the Chanak Crisis of 1922 he played a key role in negotiating a peaceful settlement between British and Turkish forces, for which he later received a knighthood. He returned home in 1923 to become GOC of the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division, a Territorial Army (TA) formation, before retiring in June 1927. He held the ceremonial colonelcy of the Welch Regiment from 1920 to 1941.
In 1920, he wrote a short history of 6th Division from 1914 to 1918, and in 1932 wrote a history of the Welch Regiment during the same period.
He died at Folkestone, Kent, in 1951 aged eighty-four and was buried St Martin's churchyard at nearby Cheriton.

John D. Olmsted (March 2, 1938 – March 8, 2011) was a California naturalist and conservationist most famous for creating the Independence Trail in Nevada City, California, as well as helping to save numerous other parcels across California, including Jug Handle State Natural Reserve in Casper, California, Goat Mountain in the Berryessa Snow Mountain Wilderness and the Bridgeport Covered Bridge. His efforts and vision of a park at Bridgeport led to the creation of the South Yuba River State Park, a length of Nationally protected Wild and Scenic land along the South Yuba River in Nevada County, California. Olmsted patterned his life after that of fellow environmentalist John Muir, with his trademark beard, formal clothing, and poetic and spiritual leanings towards the benefits of time spent in nature.
He earned a master's degree in plant ecology at Pomona College and became education director at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California. He worked as a naturalist, docent and educator at the Oakland Museum, UC Berkeley Extension and the Mendocino Art Center.
He founded the Earth Planet Museum in Grass Valley as a tribute to John Muir and to environmentalism in California, and as a visual history of recorded audio and alternate technologies. During his time in Mendocino, he worked with Hans Jenny in recognizing and preserving the Pygmy Forest, which is located within the boundaries of Jug Handle. His dream of a cross-California hiking trail remains the focus and goal of his devoted followers. He was a resident of Nevada City, California, and is survived by his two sons, Erik Olmsted and Alden Olmsted.

Chief marshal of the branch () was a senior military ranks of the Soviet Armed Forces. It was immediately above the rank of Marshal of the branch. Both ranks were equal to general of the army.
History
The ranks of chief marshal of aviation, artillery, armoured troops, engineer troops, and signals were established 27 October 1943. The three former branches had already had (since 4 February 1943) the corresponding ranks of marshal; in the two latter branches the ranks of marshal and of chief marshal were established simultaneously. When the rank of chief marshal was established, the size of the shoulder board's stars for all marshals except the now superior marshal of the Soviet Union were made about 10mm smaller and for chief marshals, the star was surrounded by a laurel wreath. On the uniform tie, chief marshals wore the marshal's star of the 2nd level. During the next forty years, the ranks of chief marshal were conferred mainly on deputy defense ministers – commanders of the corresponding branch. The ranks of chief marshal of engineer troops and chief marshal of signals, abolished in 1984, were never conferred on anybody. No chief marshal promotions were conferred after 1984. The youngest chief marshal was aviator Golovanov, 40 when promoted in 1944. Three of thirteen people who held the chief marshal rank did not retire normally: Novikov was imprisoned for seven years; Nedelin perished in the flame of an exploded rocket; Varentsov was accused of heedlessness, dismissed and degraded (his subordinate, Oleg Penkovsky, had been found to be a spy).

Santa Maria College is an independent Roman Catholic single-sex primary and secondary day and boarding school for girls, located in Attadale, a southern suburb of Perth, Western Australia.
Established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1938, the school currently caters for approximately 1,300 students from Year 5 to Year 12, including 150 boarders.
The college is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Australian Boarding Schools' Association (ABSA), the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australasia (AGSA) and the Independent Girls Schools Sports Association (IGSSA).
Santa Maria's brother school is Aquinas College located in Salter Point.
History
The College's Mercy heritage and history goes back to the arrival of seven Sisters of Mercy in Perth in 1846. They were led by Ursula Frayne.
The Sisters opened their first school on St George's Terrace in February 1846. As enrolments increased, school buildings, including a boarding school, were built in the grounds of the present Mercedes College. As the demand for boarding places increased from country families, the Mercy Superior at the time, Brigid McDonald, and her Council resolved to build a new ladies' college for boarding and day students in the bush land in Attadale. Santa Maria College opened its doors in 1938. The founding principal was Mary Bertrand Corbett.
The post-war period brought with it a rapid expansion in residential development around the college. As a result, there was a growth in student numbers and the student population at Santa Maria College changed from primarily boarders to a majority of day students.
Today Santa Maria College is a community of 1,300 students from Years 5 to 12.
Governance
Mercy Education Limited (Mercy Education) is the delegated authority, which oversees the operation of the Education ministry of the Institute of Sisters of Mercy of Australia and Papua New Guinea (ISMAPNG).
Through its board of directors, Mercy Education is responsible for the governance and operation of eleven Mercy Sponsored Colleges owned by ISMAPNG, including Santa Maria College. Mercy Education is the employer of the principal and staff of twelve Mercy Colleges.
Associations
Santa Maria College is a Catholic Education Office affiliated education provider. It is also affiliated with the Association of Independent Schools of Western Australia.
Santa Maria College is a member of the Independent Girls Schools Sporting Association.
Principals
The following individuals have served as Principal of Santa Maria College:
House system
Before the current house system came into operation the students were divided into teams - which were essentially for sporting carnivals. The houses were initially School (red), Mercian (white), Trinity (Blue), however, as the number of students increased a fourth team was added in 1963 - Xavier (gold)
Santa Maria College, as with most Australian schools, utilises a House system. Students are divided into eight Houses, for the purpose of morning meetings in House groups and Homerooms, and intra-school competition. The Houses are named after notable figures in the Sisters of Mercy's heritage in Western Australia. Dillon, de la Hoyde, Frayne, Kelly, O'Donnell and O'Reilly are named after six of the Sisters who journeyed to Western Australia from Ireland and set up the first Catholic High School in the state - Victoria Square School, now known as Mercedes College. In 2007, two new houses were added - Corbett, named after the school's first Principal, Bertrand Corbett, and Byrne.
Each House competes to earn points towards the "McAuley Shield", through various interhouse events, including: swimming, athletics, cross-country, volleyball, soccer, debating and public speaking. In 2007, the interhouse events were expanded to include an arts festival after the lobbying of several students for more events that were not sports-orientated. The arts festival required each house to prepare a short play to showcase their acting abilities. this festival has been replaced by a theatresports competition.
Boarding
The boarding community is home to 150 girls, predominantly from rural WA. The community is divided into four individual houses. Two housemothers are assigned to each house.
Uniform
The uniform consists of a green and white dress worn during summer, worn with a white socks and black leather shoes. A formal winter uniform is also required which consists of black stockings instead of socks, a bottle green, red and white striped tie, school blazer, green jumper and a green red and white tartan skirt. The sport uniform consists of a white shirt, and red shorts.

Aaron Idol (born July 4, 1980) is a Canadian professional wrestler who is best known for his work in Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling, where he rose to become the ECCW Heavyweight Champion.
Career
Training
Idol trained at the ECCW training facility House of Pain by current ECCW roster mate and star Chance Beckett. He then made his debut on March 18, 2001, against Gorilla Magilla.
2005 Pacific Cup
Idol competed in the 2005 Pacific Cup. He defeated Memphis Raines in the first round of the tournament. He went on to defeat J. J. Perez in the semi-finals. Idol emerged victorious in the finals on day two of the 2005 Pacific Cup, which was held on April 23, 2005. He defeated Puma and "The American Dragon" Bryan Danielson in a triple threat match that lasted 30 minutes. After the match, Danielson proceeded to smash the Pacific Cup and claimed that ECCW was inferior to New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Puma and Danielson proceeded to beat down Idol. ECCW promoter Dave Republic then issued a challenge and gave Antonio Inoki 30 days to respond. Inoki did not respond and the challenge was dropped as a result.
NWA Pacific Northwest Junior Heavyweight Championship
Winning the 2005 Pacific Cup took his career to next level. On June 24, 2005, Idol challenged for the NWA Pacific Northwest Junior Heavyweight Championship. He defeated Memphis Raines and former trainer Chance Beckett in a Triple Threat Match to become the new champion.
NWA Canadian Junior Heavyweight Championship
He challenged Scotty Mac for the NWA Canadian Junior Heavyweight Championship on October 21, 2005. He defeated then champion Scotty Mac in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia. On March 11, 2006 Idol vacated the title to concentrate on the ECCW Heavyweight Championship.
ECCW Heavyweight Championship
Idol challenged for the ECCW Heavyweight Champion on many occasions, but was unsuccessful. He then got the win he was looking for; he defeated Randy Tyler in a Steel Cage Match on June 22, 2007 in Surrey, British Columbia. Idol forfeited the ECCW Heavyweight Championship to Scotty Mac on December 28, 2007, due to a shoulder injury.

Eosphorite is a brown (occasionally pink) manganese hydrous phosphate mineral with chemical formula: MnAl(PO4)(OH)2·H2O. It is used as a gemstone.
Eosphorite crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system. It forms slender prismatic crystals which often form radiating or spherical clusters. The crystals often show pseudo–orthorhombic forms due to twinning.
Eosphorite forms a series with childrenite, the iron rich member, with divalent iron replacing most of the manganese in the crystal lattice. The two endmembers are isostructural but differ in their properties, such as crystal habit, coloration, and optical properties.
It was first described in 1878 for an occurrence in the Branchville Mica Mine in Branchville, Fairfield County, Connecticut, US. Its name is derived from the Greek έωσφορος for "dawn-bearing," because of its pink color. It occurs worldwide typically as a secondary mineral in phosphate rich granitic pegmatites in association with rhodochrosite, lithiophilite, triphylite, triploidite, dickinsonite, albite, cookeite, apatite, beryllonite, hydroxyl-herderite, and tourmaline. An attractive combination of eosphorite and rose quartz occurs at Taquaral, Minas Gerais, Brazil.

A mixer dance, dance mixer or simply mixer is a kind of participation dance in a social dance setting that involves changing partners as an integral part. Mixing can be built into the dance choreography or can be structured to occur more randomly. Mixers allow dancers to meet new partners and allow beginners to dance with more advanced dancers. Some people may take advantage of mixers to assess dance skills of other persons without fear of being stuck with a poor match for an entire dance.
Some mixer dances have traditional names.
The descriptions of "mixing procedures" vary, however there are several common basic rules.
The basic rule of dance etiquette "thou shalt never say 'no'" is partially waived during certain procedures of the mixer: if you have already danced with the person, you may smile to each other and skip the choice. The reasoning is that the basic purpose of the mixer — to make people dance with many new partners — has the precedence.
Sometimes a "lost and found" place is designated (e.g., the centre of the dance circle), where unmatched dancers may find each other. Reasons for the occurrence of "unmatched dancers" include the mixing process inherent in the particular dance, gender imbalance, and dancer confusion.
General mixers
A couple dances straight across the dance hall until they reach the opposite end. They separate, men and women each walking along opposite walls to the start end of the hall where they meet their next partners. The randomness in partner matching arises from the different speed of travel and often different numbers of men and women.
A couple dances a full round around the room and exchanges partners with these at the start point. Matching randomness is from the speed differences as well as from some chaos introduced at the start point.
Couples dance until the music stops, then all couples say goodbye to each other and grab next best partner who happens to be close by (Sometimes the slow ones have to run across the room to meet a spare partner).
Couples dance until the music stops. Then they separate and form two concentric "segregated" circles of men and women. As "mixing music" starts (something different from the dance danced), the circles walk in opposite directions until the mixing music stops. New partners are those who happen to stand opposite each other at this moment. If there is a disproportion between genders, the "unlucky" ones are encouraged to go and grab someone sitting or standing along the walls.
The same as above, only during the "mixing music" the dancers instead of walking do some simple kind of round dance with frequent exchange of partners.
A funny version of the above (observed during a folk Polka mixer in Lithuania): After some dancing the caller calls: "Guys inside (the circle), gals outside. Gals continue dancing, guys groom themselves." Then the caller calls "Guys, grab yourselves a pair". Then he calls: "Now gals inside, guys outside." (A pause of suspense...) "Gals continue dancing, guys groom themselves." (The joke is in the broken expectation: since in the second call "guys are outside", it would be expected for guys to dance and girls to groom themselves).
Named mixers
Paul Jones is the name used for a number of mixer dances that were popular in the first quarter of the 20th century but continue to be used in traditional dance settings to the present day. One common variation is as follows. At the signal of the caller (who may also be called by other names, such as "prompter", "cuer", or "Master of Ceremonies"), all dancers join their hands to form a circle (or several concentric ones, if crowded), with women being to the right of their partners. At the second signal of the caller, the dancers repeatedly do the Grand Right and Left move, well known in square dancing. As a result, the women move to the left (clockwise) along the circle, while gentlemen move to the right. At the third signal, dancers dance with the partner whose hand they are holding at the moment. This "third signal" is traditionally the shouted words "Paul Jones", but a whistle or other device can be substituted. This procedure may be repeated "as the master deems it advisable".
The Family Waltz is a dance mixer known in Scandinavian countries variously as Familjevalsen, Familie Vals, Familievals, etc. It is danced to the music of waltz. Basically, all dancers form a circle with hands joined, each gentleman does the balance with the woman to his left (called his "corner"), then with the woman to the right, then repeats the two balances then dances two tours of waltz (4 measures of music) with his corner and at the end passes the corner to his right (so that each gentleman now has a new corner). This may continue until the music ends or until a signal (e.g., when the caller notices that women passed the complete circle).

Holst Point () is a point at the head of Beascochea Bay which divides it into two arms, on the west coast of Graham Land, Antarctica. It was first charted by the British Graham Land Expedition under John Rymill, 1934–37, and was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1959 for Axel Holst, a Norwegian biochemist who in 1907, with Theodor C.B. Frølich, first produced experimental scurvy and laid the foundations for later work on vitamins.

The Château du Nideck is a ruined castle located in the commune of Oberhaslach in the Bas-Rhin département of France.
History
Situated on the heights of the road from Oberhaslach to Wangenbourg, the castle was first mentioned in a charter in 1264, as the property of sire Bourckard, burgrave of Nideck. In 1336 there is mention of a second castle, below the first, fief of the Bishop of Strasbourg and held by the landgraves of Basse-Alsace.
Nideck then became the property of the seigneurs of the region, in the 14th and 15th centuries, according to the various regional conflicts and other events of the time. It was besieged by the Strasbourgeois in 1448. The Müllenheim family took possession of the castle and kept it until 1509. It was finally destroyed by a fire in 1636.
The castle overlooks the Nideck waterfall and is easily reached on foot. The castle has been listed since 1898 by the French Ministry of Culture as a monument historique and is owned by the state.
The Legend of Nideck
In 1816 the legend of Nideck joined the fairy tale of the Brothers Grimm «Das Riesen-Spielzeug» (The Giant's Toy). This story inspired the poet Adalbert von Chamisso to write Das Riesenfräulein (The Giant's Daughter). The tale relates how the castle was inhabited by a couple of giants and their little daughter. Bored one day, she walked as far as the Alsace plains and found what she took to be some living toys. Once returned to the castle, her father explained to her that they were men and that they must be left in their place because they cultivated the land to feed the giants.

Hanina ben Dosa () was a first-century Jewish scholar and miracle-worker and the pupil of Johanan ben Zakai. He is buried in the town of Arraba in northern Israel.
Biography
Hanina lived in the Galilee, attracted by the fame of Johanan ben Zakai. There he served as an example of Sabbath observance, and there he and his wife were buried.
While he is reckoned among the Tannaim and is quoted in connection with a school and its disciples, no halachot and few aggadot are preserved as from him. He is "remembered more for his conduct than for his halakhic teachings. There are no laws quoted in his name." His popularity, however, which he enjoyed throughout his life, and which rendered him immortal among the mystics, rests not on his scholarship, but on his saintliness and supposed thaumaturgic powers. From the several maxims attributed to him it may be seen that he was a member of the ancient Hasideans: "One whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, his wisdom will endure; but where wisdom precedes fear of sin, wisdom will not endure; "Where a man's works are greater than his learning, his learning will stand; but where his learning is greater than his works, his learning will not stand"; "Whosoever earns the good-will of humanity is loved of God; but whoso is not beloved of man is not beloved of God". There are other teachings which indicate his Hasidean schooling.
Hanina, like all the ancient Hasideans, prayed much, and by his prayers he is said to have effected many miracles.
Stories of His Prayers
There is a story which relates that when the son of Johanan ben Zakai was very sick, the father solicited the prayers of Hanina. Hanina readily complied, and the child recovered. The overjoyed father could not refrain from expressing his admiration for his wonderful pupil, stating that he himself might have prayed the whole day without doing any good. His wife, astonished at such self-abasement on the part of her famous husband, inquired, "Is Hanina greater than you?" To this he replied, "There is this difference between us: he is like the body-servant of a king, having at all times free access to the august presence, without even having to await permission to reach his ears; while I, like a lord before a king, must await an opportune moment".
Another tale states that, at the solicitation of Gamaliel II, Hanina entreated mercy for that patriarch's son, and at the conclusion of his prayers assured Gamaliel's messengers that the patient's fever had left him. This assurance created doubt in the minds of the messengers, who promptly asked, "Art thou a prophet?" To this he replied, "I am neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet; but experience has taught me that whenever my prayer flows freely it is granted; otherwise, it is rejected." The messengers thereupon noted down Hanina's declaration, and the exact time when it was made; on reaching the patriarch's residence they found that Hanina had spoken truly.
Another legend states that, while traveling, he was caught in a shower and prayed "Master of the universe, the whole world is pleased, while Hanina alone is annoyed." The rain immediately ceased. Arriving home, he altered his prayer: "Master of the universe, shall all the world be grieved while Hanina enjoys his comfort?" Thereupon copious showers descended. With reference to this legend it was said, "Beside Ben Dosa's prayers those of the high priest himself are of no avail".
When, one Shabbat eve, his daughter filled the lamp with vinegar instead of oil, and then sadly told him of her mistake, he remarked, "He who hath endowed oil with the power of burning may endow vinegar with the same power"; and the lamp burned on throughout the whole of the next day.
According to legend, Hanina was very poor. Indeed, it became proverbial that, while the whole world was provided for through Hanina's great merits, he himself sustained life from one Sabbath eve to another on a basket of carob beans. For some time the outside world had been kept in ignorance of his privations; his wife did all that was possible to maintain an appearance of comfort, and though she had no flour with which to make dough, she would put fuel into the oven every Friday and cause columns of smoke to rise, thus making her neighbors believe that, like them, she was baking the Sabbath meals. In time, however, one woman's suspicion was aroused, and she determined to surprise Hanina's wife and discover the truth. But, according to the legend, a miracle prevented exposure. When the woman appeared at Hanina's house and looked into the smoking oven it was full of loaves. In spite of the miracle, Hanina's wife induced him to collect from heaven an advance portion of his future lot. Hanina complied with her request, and, in answer to his prayer, a golden table-leg was miraculously sent him. Husband and wife were happy; but that night the wife had a vision of heaven in which she saw the saints feasting at three-legged tables while her husband's table had only two legs. She awoke full of regret at the importunity which had deprived his table of a leg, and insisted that he pray for the withdrawal of the treasure. This he did, and the golden leg disappeared. Of this supposed miracle the Talmud says: "It was greater than the former, since heaven gives, but never takes".
Another legend relates a miracle in which Hanina was once prevented from partaking of untithed food. During one Sabbath eve, he sat down to his frugal meal, when suddenly the table receded from him. After thinking a while he recollected that he had borrowed some spices from a neighbor and that he had not separated the required tithe (see Ḥaber). He thereupon adjusted the matter, and the table returned to him. The legend also states that Hanina's donkey would not eat untithed food. Thieves had stolen the animal and confined it in their yard, furnishing it with the necessary provender; but the donkey would neither eat nor drink. As this continued for several days, the thieves concluded to free the animal, lest it starve to death and make their premises foul smelling. On its release it went straight home, none the worse for its long fast.
Legend states that Hanina was greatly grieved at not being able, with other pious people, to present something to the Temple. In his sadness he walked out of town, and, seeing a huge rock, he vowed to carry it to Jerusalem as a gift to the Holy City. He smoothed and polished it, and then looked around for help to transport it. Five laborers appeared, and offered to carry the rock to its destined place for one hundred gold pieces. Hanina, who did not possess half that amount, turned away in despair. Soon, however, other laborers appeared and demanded only five "sela'im," but they stipulated that Hanina himself should aid in the transportation. The agreement concluded, they all seized the rock, and in an instant stood before Jerusalem. When Hanina turned to pay the laborers they were nowhere to be found. He repaired to the Sanhedrin to inquire what disposition he should make of the uncollected wages. The Sanhedrin heard his tale and concluded that the laborers were ministering angels, not human laborers, and that Hanina was therefore at liberty to apply the money to his own use. He, however, presented it to the Temple.
Thus, the legend of Hanina's life is filled with a succession of miraculous tales (see Pesahim, 112b; Bava Kamma, 50a). A comparatively late mishnah remarks, "With the death of Hanina ben Dosa wonder-workers (anshe ma'aseh) ceased to exist".
His general character was likewise extolled. A contemporary rabbi, Eleazar of Modi'im, lecturing on Exodus 18:21, cited Hanina ben Dosa and his colleagues as examples of the expression "men of truth". Two centuries later an aggadist, commenting on Isaiah 3:3, said, "By the term 'honorable man' is meant one through whose merits Heaven respects [is favorable to] his generation; such a one was Hanina ben Dosa". Nor was Hanina's wife soon forgotten; long after her death, legend relates, a party of seafarers espied a work-basket studded with diamonds and pearls. A diver attempted to seize it, but was deterred by a bat kol which said that the precious basket was designed for the wife of Hanina ben Dosa, who would eventually fill it with tekhelet wool for the saints of the future.
Ḥanina never permitted anything to distract him from praying. Once, while praying, a lizard (or snake) bit him, but he did not interrupt his prayers. To his disciples' anxious inquiries he answered that he had been so preoccupied in prayer as not even to feel the bite. When the people found the reptile, dead, they exclaimed, "Woe to the man whom a lizard bites, and woe to the lizard that bites R. Ḥanina b. Dosa!" His wonderful escape is accounted for by the assertion that the result of a lizard's bite depends upon which reaches water first, the man or the lizard; if the former, the latter dies; if the latter, the former dies. In Ḥanina's case a spring miraculously opened under his very feet. The Babylonian Talmud has a different version of this miracle, not taking place during prayer.

Ensemble () is a liberal political coalition in France. Formed in November 2021 as Ensemble Citoyens, it includes Renaissance (REN), Democratic Movement (MoDem), Agir, Territories of Progress (TDP), Horizons, En commun, and the Progressive Federation.
History
François Bayrou, the leader of the Democratic Movement (MoDem) has previously proposed the formation of a coalition that would include centrist and centre-right parties. In November 2021, president of the National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, accepted his proposal and together they had formed Ensemble Citoyens. Besides the Democratic Movement and La République En Marche!, Agir was also its founding member. In the following month, they were joined by the Radical Party, Horizons, Territories of Progress, and En Commun.
From its foundation in November, the coalition has been headed by Ferrand as its leader, Bayrou and Édouard Philippe as vice-presidents, and Stanislas Guerini as secretary-general. Jean Castex has also affiliated himself with the coalition. Philippe suspended its participation in the coalition on 14 January 2022, although, four days later he had announced that his party was reinstated into the coalition. In April, LREM announced that it would change its party name to "Renaissance", and a month later, the name of the coalition was shortened to just Ensemble. The Progressive Federation joined the coalition in May 2022.
Members
Objectives
The coalition aimed to bring the presidential majority of Emmanuel Macron together in order to present its joint candidates for the 2022 legislative election. In May 2022, Ferrand indicated their commitment for "a stable majority in the National Assembly", while Philippe specified that the program of Ensemble "is that of the Macron". Bayrou indicated that the parties would form a joint parliamentary group in the National Assembly. Some media sources consider it as a modern incarnation of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's Union for French Democracy (UDF), founded in 1978.

United States lightship Buffalo (LV-82) was a lightship built in 1911 for the United States Lighthouse Service and stationed off Point Abino, Ontario, Canada to help guide vessels heading for the harbor at Buffalo, New York.
During the Great Lakes Storm of 1913, LV-82 stayed at its assigned station and was sunk with the loss of all six crew members.
On May 13, 1914 the wreckage of LV-82 was located two miles from its assigned location in 63 feet of water. Following two failed salvage attempts, LV-82 was raised from the bottom using pontoons and sent to be refurbished. She served as a relief ship from 1916 to 1925, and was stationed as the Eleven Foot Shoals Lightship from 1925 up to her decommissioning.
The Buffalo was in service until 1936 when she was decommissioned. After decommissioning, papers were signed by President Roosevelt to have her moved to a VFW post in Massachusetts. However, this never happened as she was burnt at the dock by vandals, and was considered a total loss, so she was scrapped.

August Wilhelm Antonius Graf Neidhardt von Gneisenau (27 October 176023 August 1831) was a Prussian field marshal. He was a prominent figure in the reform of the Prussian military and the War of Liberation.
Early life
Gneisenau was born at Schildau in the Electorate of Saxony. He was the son of a Saxon lieutenant of artillery, August William Neidhardt, and his wife Maria Eva Neidhardt, née Müller. He grew up in great poverty at Schildau, and subsequently at Würzburg and Erfurt. In 1777 he entered the University of Erfurt, but two years later joined an Austrian regiment quartered there. In 1782, taking the additional name of Gneisenau from some lost estates of his family in Austria, he entered as an officer the service of the Margrave of Bayreuth-Ansbach. With one of that prince's mercenary regiments in British pay, he saw active service and gained valuable experience in the American Revolutionary War. Returning in 1786, he applied for Prussian service, and King Frederick the Great gave him a commission as first lieutenant in the infantry.
Made Stabskapitän (Staff Captain) in 1790, Gneisenau served in Poland from 1793-1794. Ten years of subsequent quiet garrison life in Jauer enabled him to undertake wide-ranging studies of military and political history. In 1796 he married Caroline von Kottwitz.
Napoleonic Wars
In 1806 Gneisenau served as one of Prince Hohenlohe's staff-officers, fought at Saalfeld (10 October 1806) and Jena (14 October 1806), and a little later commanded a provisional infantry brigade which fought under L'Estocq in the Lithuanian campaign. Early in 1807, the Prussian Army sent Major von Gneisenau as commandant to Kolberg, which, though small and ill-protected, with the additional assistance of Schill and Nettelbeck succeeded in holding out against Napoleonic forces until the Peace of Tilsit of July 1807. The commandant received the highly prized Pour le Mérite and promotion to lieutenant-colonel.
A wider sphere of work now opened to Gneisenau. As chief of engineers, and a member of the reorganizing committee, he played a great part, along with Scharnhorst, in the work of reconstructing the Prussian army. Though primarily devoted to the problem of military reorganization, he exercised considerable influence on the general policy of the Ministry (established in December 1808) as well. A colonel in 1809, he soon drew upon himself, by his energy, the suspicion of the dominant French, and soon after the fall of Stein (January 1809), Gneisenau retired. But after visiting Austria, Imperial Russia, Sweden and England on secret missions, he returned to Berlin and resumed his place as a leader of the patriotic party.
Open military work and secret machinations tested his energy and patriotism equally, and after the outbreak of the Wars of Liberation in 1812, Major-General Gneisenau became Blücher's quartermaster-general. Thus began the connection between these two soldiers which has furnished military history with one of the best examples of harmonious co-operation between a commander and his chief-of-staff. With Blücher, Gneisenau served in the capture of Paris in 1814; his military character perfectly complemented Blücher's, and under this happy guidance the troops of Prussia, at times defeated but never discouraged, fought their way into the heart of France. The plan for the march on Paris, which led directly to the abdication of Napoleon in April 1814, was specifically the work of the chief-of-staff. In 1814, as a reward for his distinguished service, Gneisenau — along with Yorck, Kleist, and Bülow — was elevated to the rank of count, while at the same time Blücher became Prince of Wahlstatt.
In 1815, once more chief of Blücher's staff, Gneisenau played a very conspicuous part in the Waterloo campaign of June/July 1815. Senior generals such as Yorck and Kleist had been set aside in order that the chief-of-staff should take command in case of need, and when on the field of Ligny (16 June 1815) the old field marshal was disabled, Gneisenau assumed command of the Prussian army. He rallied the army and directed it towards Wavre, from where part of it marched to join Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, where the flanking attack by the Prussians helped to decide the battle.
On the field of Waterloo, Gneisenau carried out a pursuit that resulted in the capture of Napoleon's carriage. In the days following the battle, Gneisenau saw that the Prussian forces reached Paris before Wellington. In reward Gneisenau gained further promotion and the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle.
Later life
In 1816 Gneisenau was appointed to command the VIII Prussian Corps, but soon retired from the service, both because of ill health and for political reasons.
For two years Gneisenau lived in retirement at his estate, Erdmannsdorf in Silesia, but in 1818 he became governor of Berlin, as successor to Kalckreuth, and member of the Staatsrath (Council of State). In 1825 he was promoted to General Field Marshal. In 1831, soon after the outbreak of the Polish insurrection of 1830, he was appointed to the command of the Army of Observation on the Polish frontier, with Clausewitz as his chief-of-staff. At Posen he was struck down by cholera and died on 24 August 1831, soon followed by his chief-of-staff, who fell a victim to the same disease in November.
Honours
He received the following orders and decorations:
Legacy
A statue by Christian Daniel Rauch was erected in Berlin in 1855, and in memory of the siege of 1807, the Kolberg grenadier regiment received his name in 1889. One of his sons led a brigade of the VIII Army Corps in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870.
A painting of him by Marie von Brühl is in the collection of Deutsches Historisches Museum.
One of the four operations of the German Spring Offensive of 1918 were named after him.
Several German navy ships, including the World War I armored cruiser SMS Gneisenau, the World War II battleship Gneisenau, and a post-war training frigate were named after him.
Additionally, several German cities have streets named "Gneisenaustraße" (Gneisenau Street), including Berlin (which has an U-bahn stop in his name), Leipzig, Hamburg, Hanover and Heidelberg.

Angria or Angaria (, ) is a historical region in the present-day German states of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. The chronicler Widukind of Corvey in his Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres denoted it as the central region of the medieval Duchy of Saxony lying along the middle reaches of the Weser river between Westphalia and Eastphalia. Its name was derived from the Germanic Angrivarii tribe which had joined the Saxon tribal confederation, and it was centered on the town of Minden, see of a bishopric since 803.
The Angrivarii lands were conquered by Charlemagne during the Saxon Wars; according to the Royal Frankish Annals, the Angrian commanders concluded a separate peace agreement with the Carolingian Empire near Bückeburg in 775.
In 1180, the Emperor Frederick I deposed the duke of Saxony, Henry the Lion, and divided the duchy into two parts through the so-called Gelnhausen Charter. The Duchy of Westphalia was granted to the Archbishopric of Cologne, while Angria was given to Bernhard of Anhalt, who used the Saxon ducal title. The name Angria thereafter became obsolete. In the 13th century, the central area on the Weser became the nucleus of the County of Hoya, which in 1582 was inherited by the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

Iota Phi Lambda is not an National Pan Hellenic Council (NPHC) sorority and dual membership within Iota Phi Lambda Sorority and NPHC sororities is allowed.
History
The sorority was founded on June 1, 1929 in Chicago, Illinois by Lola Mercedes Parker. The founding of the sorority was important for African American women as after World War I there was the "Great Migration" of blacks from the South to the Northern cities, seeking greater opportunities and a more tolerant society. These changes underscored the need for blacks to learn new skills. These skills, in turn, would hopefully ensure a better way of life for tens of thousands of blacks that had migrated northward.

The politics of Tripura, a state in Northeast India, has been dominated by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. As of 2020, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is the ruling party in the states's legislative assembly and also won the two parliamentary constituencies in 2019 Indian general election. As of 2021, the India Trinamool Congress (AITC) has entered the political area of Tripura. It secured more than 20% votes in the 2021 Agartala Municipal Elections securing the position of runner-up ahead of the CPI-M. It also secured the position of runner-up in several other wards around the state garnering nearly 17% of votes all around the state. Ashish Das an MLA from the BJP has defected to the AITC.
Tripura Territorial Council
The Tripura Territorial Council Act of 1956 opened up for direct elections to a council with the same name (TTC). The TTC had 30 directly elected members and two members nominated by the governor. The first TTC election was held in 1957, followed by fresh polls in 1959. The third council elected in February 1962 had 20 members.
Constituencies
Tripura sends two representatives to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the parliament of India) and one representative to the Rajya Sabha (parliament's upper house). Panchayats (local self-governments) elected by local body elections are present in many villages for self-governance. Tripura also has a unique tribal self-governance body, the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council. This council is responsible for some aspects of local governance in 527 villages with high density of the scheduled tribes. The state has 60 assembly constituencies, as of 2018.
Election result
The main political parties are the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Left Front, the India Trinamool Congress and Indian National Congress along with regional parties like IPFT and INPT. Until 1977, the state was governed by the Indian National Congress. The Left Front was in power from 1978 to 1988, and then again from 1993 to 2018. During 1988–1993, the Congress and Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti were in a ruling coalition. In the 2013 Tripura Legislative Assembly election, the Left Front won 50 out of 60 seats in the Assembly. In 2014 Indian general election, both parliament seats in Tripura were won by the Communist Party of India (Marxist).. The 2018 assembly election resulted in loss for the Left Front. The Bharatiya Janata Party won an overall majority in the state, resulting in the end of the Communist Party's uninterrupted twenty-five year rule. BJP won 44 out of 60 seats in the Assembly by coalition with IPFT. Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI [M]) only got 16 seats and Indian National Congress lost by huge margins in all constituencies.

The 1977 Ice Hockey World Championships took place in Vienna, Austria from 21 April to 8 May. Eight teams took part, first playing each other once, then the four best teams advancing to a new round. The tournament was also the 55th ice hockey European Championship. Czechoslovakia won for the fifth time, and second in a row, claiming their 14th and final European title as well.
Canada returned after an eight-year absence with a team comprised completely of NHL players from teams that had missed the Stanley Cup playoffs. While being competitive in most games, many people were reportedly upset by the Canadians' conduct on the ice and after the games. The team refused to listen to the opposing teams' national anthems when they lost, and the coach, Johnny Wilson, explained their multiple misconduct penalties by saying, "We just couldn't compete with the Soviets, and ... it is natural to try to get revenge.".
The tournament itself was very close for the medals, with a spectacular last day. Canada, with a chance still to get a bronze, set a record by defeating the eventual champions eight to two. Never before had a first place team lost a game that badly. But the Swedes, by beating the Soviets for a second time, saved the Czechoslovaks, and at the same time pushed themselves into second and Canada into fourth.
World Championship Group A (Austria)

Romania was relegated to Group B.
World Championship Group B (Japan)
Played in Tokyo 10–21 March. Played with nine countries because Group A had relegated two nations the previous year to make room for Canada.
East Germany was promoted to Group A, both the Netherlands and Austria were relegated to Group C.
World Championship Group C (Denmark)
Played in Copenhagen and Hørsholm, 12–20 March. The hosts did not lose a game, outscored their opponents by forty-six, but it was not enough to win. Only one team was promoted this year so that Group B could return to having eight clubs, and their tie on the last day against Italy left them in second place. Spain made its debut in the World Championships, not having competed since the European Championships of 1926.
Italy was promoted to Group B.

Major General Lena Maria Persson Herlitz (born 12 August 1967) is a Swedish Amphibious Corps officer. She currently serves as Chief of Policy and Plans Department at the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters in Stockholm.
Career
Persson Herlitz began her military career in Älvsborg Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA 4) in Gothenburg in 1991. In 1989, all positions within the Swedish Armed Forces were opened for women, and the military interest in combination with the search for a challenge made her enlist in 1991. She came to serve in a mobile barrier company. In 1993-1994, she attended officer training at the Swedish Navy Officers' College (Marinens officershögskola, MOHS). From 1995 to 1996 she was placed in the 5th Amphibious Battalion as an instructor for command and communication systems. From 1997 to 1998 Persson Herlitz served in the Swedish battalion BA09 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There she served as deputy chief of staff platoon; also driver and gunner of a 12.7 mm machine gun with one of the platoon's Patria Pasi armoured personnel carriers. Back in Sweden, she served as platoon commander in the 5th Amphibious Battalion. In 2000, she became an adjutant to the regimental commander of Amf 4, Colonel Bo Andersson, and later, after completing staff training at the Swedish National Defence College, became company commander of the 5th Amphibious Battalion during the years 2003–2004. Amf 4 was disbanded in connection with the Defense Act of 2004 and Persson Herlitz was offered a job in Stockholm and attended the management program at the Swedish National Defence College in the years 2004-2006, which was a prerequisite for becoming a lieutenant colonel.
In 2006, she was offered a position at the Swedish Military Intelligence and Security Service (MUST) and initially became an analyst specializing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. From August 2007 to April 2008, she served as head of the Swedish National Intelligence Cell in Kabul, Afghanistan. Back in Sweden, she returned to MUST as head of the Afghanistan Desk and then also had to take responsibility for the entire Asia section May 2008. She served in this position until December 2009. From 2008, Persson Herlitz served one month a year as Aide-de-camp to Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden. In January 2010, Persson Herlitz was appointed commander of KS21, the Swedish contingent within Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Kosovo. She served there until October 2010, and in November the same year she was appointed head of M3 PLANS, Deputy Chief of Staff within the Maritime Component Command at the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters in Stockholm. In March 2012, Persson Herlitz was deployed again to Afghanistan, this time as military advisor for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) in Kabul. She left this position in December the same year. During this time, she also served as contingent commander team leader for the Afghan National Security Forces.
Upon her return to Sweden, on 1 January 2013, Persson Herlitz took command over the Swedish Armed Forces International Centre (SWEDINT). SWEDINT is the Swedish Armed Forces' competence centers for integrated multinational staff training. During this time, SWEDINT became the first training center in the world to become NATO certified. Persson Herlitz was then appointed military adviser at the Ministry of Defence's Unit for Military Capability and Operations (MFI), serving there from October 2014 to March 2017. In April 2017, Persson Herlitz assumed the position of head of Training Department in the Training & Procurement Staff at the Swedish Armed Forces Headquarters.

Explorer 17 (also known as Atmosphere Explorer-A (AE-A) and S6) was a NASA satellite, launched at Cape Canaveral from LC-17B on a Delta B launch vehicle, on 3 April 1963, at 02:00:02 GMT, to study the Earth's upper atmosphere. It was the first satellite of five "Atmosphere Explorer".
Mission
The successful launch and operating of Explorer 17 allowed scientists for the first time to obtain instantaneous atmospheric density measurements using several independent measuring systems, to measure the atmosphere during a single day under nearly constant local time conditions and geomagnetic activity, and to compare direct measurements of density with those inferred from measurements of perturbations in the satellite period orbit.
Spacecraft
Explorer 17 was a spin-stabilized sphere in diameter. The spacecraft was vacuum sealed in order to prevent contamination of the local atmosphere.
Instruments
Explorer 17 carried four pressure gauges for the measurement of total neutral particle density, two mass spectrometers for the measurement of certain neutral particle concentrations, and two electrostatic probes for ion concentration and electron temperature measurements. Battery power failed on 10 July 1963. Three of the four pressure gauges and both electrostatic probes operated normally. One spectrometer malfunctioned, and the other operated intermittently.
Experiments
Langmuir Probes
The Explorer 17 experiment payload included two independent Langmuir probe systems. One of the sensors was used to provide measurements of the positive ion density, and the other measured electron temperature. Each system used a two-element sensor consisting of an outer cylindrical guard electrode long which was concentric with an inner collector electrode in diameter and long. The potentials of the electrodes were varied with respect to the satellite shell. The electron temperature probe was swept at a rate of 10 sweeps per second over two different voltage intervals, 0 to 0.75 V and 0 to 1.5 V. The ion density probe was swept from -3 to +2 Volts in 2 seconds. The currents to the collectors were measured and telemetered. The ion concentration and electron temperature could be determined from the current versus voltage information. The experiment operated normally from launch until 10 July 1963, when the spacecraft batteries failed.
Mass Spectrometers
Two identical double-focusing magnetic mass spectrometers were used to measure the concentrations of the major neutral particle constituents of the upper atmosphere, namely, atomic and molecular oxygen, atomic and molecular nitrogen, helium, and water vapor. These neutral particles were ionized by electron bombardment. Measurements of the six different ion currents and the total current were made sequentially for 4 seconds in high sensitivity and 4 seconds in low sensitivity. A period of 64 seconds was required for the entire measurement cycle. Included in the cycle was an operation to correct any DC drift of the zero voltage level in the output signal. One spectrometer produced useless data due to a malfunction. The other detector system experienced intermittent degeneration of the amplifier output, and, consequently, the data were good only during certain periods. This degeneration was not a result of instrument malfunction but of an unexpected spacecraft attitude which oriented the sensor toward the Sun and caused it to overheat.
Pressure Gauges
Two Redhead (cold cathode) and two Bayard-Alpert (hot filament) ionization vacuum gauges were used to measure the neutral particle density and ambient pressure of the upper atmosphere between and . The pressure gauges were operated for 4-minutes periods when the satellite was within range of a ground telemetry station. The neutral particles were ionized by electron bombardment, and the resulting ion currents were detected and converted to voltages suitable for telemetry. These two types of sensors together were capable of measuring over the pressure range 10.E-4 torr (10.E12 molecules/cc) to 10.E-11 torr. One Bayard-Alpert gauge suffered a loss in sensitivity, and no useful data were obtained from it. The remaining three gauges operated normally.
Orbital decay
The spacecraft decayed from orbit after 1,325 days on 24 November 1966.

Synodus intermedius, the common sand diver, is a species of fish in the lizardfish family, the Synodontidae, a basal ray-finned fish in the class Actinopterygii. Sand divers inhabit subtropical marine ecosystems, (37-17°N), including sandy- bottom areas on continental shelves, coral reefs, estuaries, bays, and reef structures. They are demersal or benthic fish, which means they live on or close to the sea bed. Distribution ranges from the northern Gulf of Mexico south to the Guianas, and western Atlantic north to North Carolina and Bermuda. They are a common lizardfish in the West Indies. They grow to about total length, and weigh around .
The trunk of sand divers is a pallid color, ranging from gray to brownish gray with mottling on the head and trunk grading to a whitish underbelly. They have variable markings, including a black patch on the shoulder girdle, reddish-brown vertical bars across the back, and thin yellow-gold striped lateral lines running from behind the gill flap or operculum to the base of the tail or caudal fin. They are able to alter their color, becoming paler or darker to blend with the background.
Etymology
The etymology of Synodus is of Greek origin: syn, symphysis or grown together, and , which means teeth. The common English name for the species is "sand diver" and for the genus "lizardfishes". In French, the fish is named anoli de sable and in Spanish it is known under various names, such as chile manchado, doncella, guaripete, guavina, lagarto gigante, lagarto mato, lagarto manchado, or manuelito.
Taxonomy and evolution
Lizardfishes are aulopiforms in the family Synodontidae, which is represented in the western Atlantic by three genera: Synodus, comprising six species, Saurida, comprising four species, and Trachinocephalus which includes a single species.
The fossil record indicates an evolutionary divergence of the Aulopidae dating back to the Early Cretaceous or Late Jurassic, with most extant families appearing by the Late Cretaceous to the Eocene. Aulopoids are a small group of benthic fishes that inhabit coral reefs and continental shelves, including lizardfishes (Synodus, Saurida) and flagfin fishes (Aulopus). Integrated studies regarding deep-sea evolutionary adaptations, simultaneous hermaphroditism, and tubular eyes suggest that the stem species of lizardfishes arose in a marine environment with separate sexes, and round eyes that were laterally directed. The study also identified the suborder Alepisauroidei as the largest and oldest known vertebrae clade with the reproductive strategy of simultaneous hermaphroditism.
Description
Sand divers have an elongated body and can grow to long. The dorsal (upper) surface is dappled brownish-gray and a black patch occurs on the shoulder girdle at the upper end of the gill slits. About eight pairs of reddish-brown bars are on the top and sides of the body, broadest at the lateral line and narrowing towards the belly. Also, slender yellowish-gold longitudinal lines run along the body. The ventral (under) surface of the fish is pale. The tip of the lower jaw is rounded, without a fleshy knob, and the soft rays of the dorsal fin are relatively short, the tip of the front one lying on top of the origin of the hind one when depressed. These characteristics help to distinguish this species from the offshore lizardfish (S. poeyi). The anal fin of the sand diver has 10-12 soft rays which distinguish it from the otherwise similar diamond lizardfish (S. synodus) which has eight to 10. Another fish with which it might be confused is the Atlantic lizardfish (S. saurus), but that species is uncommon in the Caribbean and has slender, blue or turquoise longitudinal lines.
As is common among benthic and demersal fish, the cornea of the eye has an iridescent layer, the function of which may be to offer protection to the eye from very bright light. The mouth is wide and filled with numerous needlelike teeth. Two rows of teeth are in the upper jaw; the inner row teeth are longer than the outer row. Three rows of teeth are on the lower jaw; the outer row is covered by lips, the middle teeth increase in size. Both jaws have posterior teeth that slant slightly toward the back. Also, three or four rows of depressible teeth exist on the palate. The tongue has five rows of teeth, the largest positioned closest to the anterior tip, slanting toward the back.
Distribution and habitat
Sand divers are found in the subtropical western Atlantic Ocean between 37 and 17°N, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Their range extends from North Carolina and Bermuda, southwards to Santa Catarina in Brazil, and includes the West Indies, Caribbean Sea and northern, eastern, and southern Gulf of Mexico. They have been reported from São Tomé and Príncipe in the eastern Atlantic, though that record is questionable, and are also known from the Philippines. Sand divers are usually found on or near the seabed in sandy areas among boulders or in sandy corridors in reefs, but they also rest on the tops of reef structures, propping themselves up on their pectoral fins. They are found at depths down to , but they seldom occur near shore and most records are in the depth range .
Ecology
Sand divers are piscivorous ambush predators once thought to occupy a midtrophic position as a lie-in-wait predator. They occupy a high trophic position as active hunters that feed on other predatory fishes. In some systems, they are considered apex predators. They can be found on top of the sand or on reef tops, and also bury themselves in the sand with only their heads exposed. Sand divers feed primarily on finfish and bony fish (such as bar jacks, wrasses, small grunts, and silversides), but also feed on benthic crustaceans, and cephalopods including squid and cuttlefish.

Rock Point is an unincorporated community in Jackson County, Oregon, United States. Rock Point lies just north of an I-5 and Oregon Route 99 interchange along the Rogue River between the cities of Rogue River and Gold Hill.
The community's name derives from the geologic formations at this location. Writers have sometime referred to the location as Point of Rocks, and early settlers called it Dardanelles. A Dardanelles post office opened near here on October 19, 1852, with William G. T'Vault as postmaster. The T'Vault property was on the south side of the river east of Rock Point.
Rock Point was an important stop for travelers in the 19th century. A tavern built here in the 1870s is still standing. The community also had a railroad station named Rock Point and a Rock Point post office that operated from 1859 through 1912 with John B. White as the first postmaster. The community is known for a "fine concrete arch" bridge that was built by McCullough 1919, that carries the old Pacific Highway (Route 99) over the river.

El jefe infiltrado is a 2014 Spanish reality television series based on the British series Undercover Boss. Each episode follows a person in a high management position at a major business who poses as an entry-level employee to discover faults in the company. The first series premiered on 3 April 2014.
Format
Each episode features a high-ranking executive or the owner of a corporation going undercover as an entry-level employee in their own company. The executives alter their appearance and assume an alias and fictional back-story. The fictitious explanation given for the accompanying camera crew is that the executives are being filmed as part of a documentary about entry-level workers in a particular industry. They spend approximately one week undercover, working in various areas of their company operations, with a different job and in most cases a different location each day. They are exposed to a series of predicaments with amusing results, and invariably spend time getting to know the people who work in the company, learning about their professional and personal challenges.
At the end of their week undercover, the executives return to their true identity and request the employees they worked with individually to corporate headquarters. The bosses reveal their identity, and reward hard-working employees through campaign, promotion, or financial rewards, while other employees are given training or better working conditions.
Episodes
The first series has featured 6 episodes. The series premiered on 3 April 2014.

The Viking (), also known as White Thunder and Vikings of the Ice Field, is a 1931 Newfoundland/American adventure film about sealing directed by George Melford. The Viking was the first film to record sound and dialogue on location with the use of magnetic wire recording. It is best known for the explosion aboard the ship SS Viking (an actual sealing ship) during filming, in which many members of the crew, including producer Varick Frissell, were killed. It remains the incident with the largest loss of life in film history.
Plot
Set on the coast of Newfoundland, a rivalry develops between Jed Nelson (Arthur Vinton), a seal hunter, and Luke Oarum (Charles Starrett), a local man considered a jinx. Worried that his rival may try to steal his girlfriend Mary Joe (Louise Huntington), calling him a coward, the seal hunter goads Luke into accompanying him on an Arctic sealing expedition on Viking, commanded by Capt. Barker (Robert Bartlett).. They both end up in a hunting party on the ice floes and eventually find themselves stranded. Jed tries to kill Luke, but the snow blinds him and his gunshot misses.
Despite the attempt on his life, Luke helps walk the blinded Jed across the ice floes back to Newfoundland after they are unable to return to the ship. On recovering his sight at home, Jed gains new respect for his rival and vows that he will beat senseless any man who derides the character of his new friend.

Production
American-born producer Varick Frissell's previous short films, The Lure of Labrador and The Swilin' Racket (also known as The Great Arctic Seal Hunt), prompted him to make a full-length feature entitled Vikings of the Ice Field. Paramount Pictures put up $100,000 to finance the production, while insisting that Hollywood personnel be used. Frissell hired director George Melford, who had attended McGill University in Montreal and had experience in filming Canadian subjects previously.
By 1930, Frissell had completed most of the principal photography on location in Quidi Vidi. For realistic footage, Frissell then took his crew to the Grand Banks and Labrador to film action sequences. The film was privately shown at the Nickel Theatre at St. John's on March 5, 1931. After this screening, Frissell decided that his film needed more real scenes from the Labrador ice floes. Within days, Frissell and his crew had joined the SS Viking for its annual seal hunt. The ship got trapped in ice near the Horse Islands.
On March 15, 1931, while trying to film an iceberg, Frissell, Alexander Penrod, 25 crew members and a stowaway were killed in an explosion. Some of the survivors made the over-ice trek to the Horse Islands, while others were rescued by vessels dispatched to the area.
Despite the fatal accident, the film was completed and released in June 1931. The title was changed from White Thunder to The Viking. A French-language version Ceux du Viking was released in 1932.
Reception
Reviews for The Viking varied, while the story was generally panned. The New York Times review referred to the film's story as "sketchy". The reviewer, however, noted: "'The Viking', like Mr Varick's silent work, 'The Swilin' Racket', has many marvelous scenes of the ice fields and of the adventures of men on a seal hunt off Labrador. It is enhanced by being made with sound effects, but the dialogue, like the story, is merely incidental."
The Theater Guild Magazine found the story "melodramatic" and the screenplay uninteresting in comparison to the cinematography. The Film Daily gave a negative review, noting the "weakness" of the story.
White Thunder, a National Film Board documentary on Varick Frissell's life, directed by Newfoundlander Victoria King, was released in 2002.

The Walter Schottky Institute (WSI) () is a research center at the Technical University of Munich, dedicated to the physics of semiconductors. Established in 1988, it is located on its Garching campus. It is named after physicist Walter H. Schottky.
History
The idea for an interdisciplinary research facility that would bridge the gap between fundamental physics and applied semiconductor electronics emerged in the early 1980s. In February 1985, Gerhard Abstreiter, professor at the Technical University of Munich, wrote a memorandum about the establishment of a research institute, with specific focus on semiconductor research and device development. After Klaus von Klitzing, who had been working at the physics department of the TU Munich until shortly before the announcement, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1985, the idea, which was already supported by the research board of Siemens, received great approval.
Thus, as early as December 1985, the general conditions for founding the research institute as a collaborative project between the Technical University of Munich and Siemens were discussed with Bavarian state government. The construction costs were paid jointly by Siemens and the Bavarian state. After two years of construction, the Walter Schottky Institute was officially inaugurated on July 14, 1988. The university took over the institute completely in 1992.
Facilities
The institute building covers an area of 2400 m2 and provides space for laboratories and offices of eight research groups in four chairs with a total of over 150 employees. Of this, 250 m2 is available as a cleanroom. The equipment includes several molecular-beam epitaxy systems, which are used to fabricate nanoelectronic structures. The institute is considered one of the world's leading research facilities for the fabrication and characterization of semiconductor heterostructures.
In July 2010, an extension building, the Center for Nanotechnology and Nanoscience, was opened in the immediate vicinity.

The orange-fronted yellow finch (Sicalis columbiana) is a species of South American bird in the family Thraupidae. It has a highly disjunct distribution with S. c. columbiana found in Colombia and Venezuela, S. c. goeldii along the Amazon River in Brazil, and S. c. goeldii in east-central Brazil. It is found in semi-open areas, typically near water and sometimes near humans. The male closely resembles the saffron finch, but it is smaller, has a more contrasting orange front, and dusky lores. The female is overall olive-gray with whitish underparts, and yellow to the wings and tail.

WAGR (1340 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a Gospel music format to the Lumberton, North Carolina, United States, area. The station is currently owned by WAGR Broadcasting, Inc.
History
Al Kahn bought WAGR in January 1957, 27 months after the station signed on, and signed WJSK on the air in 1964. He ran both stations until 1992.
After Messa Corp. bought the stations from Southeastern Broadcasting Corp. in July 1992, WAGR and WJSK ended their tradition of airing only Lumberton high school football and began carrying games involving other Robeson County teams.
In 1993, Arthur DeBerry and Associates of Durham bought WAGR and WJSK.
After WJSK was sold to Cape Fear Broadcasting in 1998, Wes Cookman, owner of Fayetteville radio station WIDU, bought WAGR, along with WEWO in Laurinburg.
Later, Cookman added WFMO in Fairmont to what was called "WE-DO" network, whose black gospel and news and information programming originated from the WIDU studios.

The Flins Renault Factory (also known internally as the Pierre Lefaucheux Factory in memory of Pierre Lefaucheux, Renault's first CEO following nationalisation) is a car factory in France, straddling the towns of Flins and Aubergenville in Yvelines, approximately 40 km from Paris. It is the largest (and, since the closure of the Boulogne-Billancourt factory, the oldest) Renault Group factory in mainland France. It was designed by the architect Bernard Zehrfuss and opened in 1952. It is 237 hectares in extent, of which 67 are occupied by covered buildings.
Between 1952 and the summer break of July 2009 the plant had assembled 16,850,000 vehicles.
History
Creating Flins plant was part of a decentralisation plan for Renault with the aim of removing from the Billancourt plant the most repetitive and stressful tasks, which had caused several protests. The number of employees increased over the years, passing from 2,100 in 1953 to 10,600 in 1962. During the 1968 protests in France incidents were recorded around the factory.
Having in the past produced historic models such as the Dauphine, in 2009 125,400 Clios emerged from the Flins production line, although this was a lesser quantity than the 179,495 produced at Renault's Bursa plant that year.
The Flins plant produces numerous metal and plastic moulded components for use in Renault and Nissan factories worldwide which appears to give it a more secure future than some of the manufacturer's more recently constructed plants in France. In November 2009 it was confirmed that Flins would build the company's first electric powered volume model, based on the "Zoé" concept car. Considerable capacity is also being created for the manufacture and assembly of batteries in connection with this project.
the plant produces the fourth and third generation Renault Clio and the Renault Zoe. In 2013, it assembled 129,884 units. In 2017 the plant started producing the Nissan Micra, alongside the Zoe.

Son ar chistr ("The song of the cider" in the Breton language, "Ev Chistr 'ta Laou!" originally) is a traditional song of Brittany, whose words in Breton were written in 1929 by two Morbihan teenagers Jean Bernard and Jean-Marie Prima. The melody became known by the interpretation of the famous Breton singer Alan Stivell in the 1970s and in 1977 by the Dutch band Bots under the name "Zeven dagen lang".
Use
The song is still used by folk groups around the world and has been translated into many languages. Though many groups keep the popular motif, the lyrics sometimes differ completely from the original. Recordings include:

The 1966 National Soccer League season was the forty-third season under the National Soccer League (NSL) name. The season began in late May and concluded in late October with Windsor Teutonia claiming their first NSL Championship against Toronto Croatia. The regular-season title was secured by Sudbury Italia by finishing first throughout the regular season.
The ownership of Stanley Park Stadium was transferred back to the city of Toronto as the league accumulated a heavy debt, and failed to make the necessary payments to retain the ownership. After the conclusion of the 1966 season, the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League (ECPSL) merged with the National Soccer League.
Overview
The league's ownership of Stanley Park Stadium was put further in jeopardy as the league officials were summoned to the Toronto Board of Control to address the outstanding debt owed to the city, and other financial institutions. Originally the board members voted to repossess the stadium, and place it under the control of the Toronto Department of Parks and Recreation. The decision was later rescinded and an agreement was reached which required the league to pay only their taxes owed from the 1963 season within eight weeks. If the league failed to pay the installment within the time frame then the city would take possession of the stadium. The league ownership, unfortunately, failed to honor the agreement, and the stadium was transferred back to the ownership of the city. The city assumed the league's debts, and in return charged the league for the usage of the faculty in hopes of repaying off the debt.
The membership in the National Soccer League decreased from twelve to eight clubs. The departing clubs were Toronto Abruzzi, Toronto Azzurri, and Toronto Hakoah while Toronto Olympia took a sabbatical. The attendance at Stanley Park Stadium saw a 25% increase since their initial decrease in the early 1960s. Signs of financial difficulties were becoming apparent with the NSL's competitor the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League as some teams were expressing intentions of defecting to American-based leagues. The reports proved to be factual as the ECPSL decided to merge with the NSL after the conclusion of both seasons. The initial intentions of the merger consisted of plans of transforming the NSL into a feeder league for the ECPSL with further expansion throughout the country and into the United States. Ultimately the result of the merger saw the remaining ECPSL clubs join the NSL and elevate the status of the NSL to a secondary league behind the American-based National Professional Soccer League, and the United Soccer Association.

Playoffs
The preliminary round of the playoffs was contested in a round-robin style with two separate groups where the two group winners would qualify for the final. Sudbury Italia, Toronto Croatia, and Toronto Ukrainia were placed in the first group, while Toronto Hellas, Toronto Hungaria, and Windsor Teutonia were placed in the second group. Croatia and Windsor finished as their respective group champions, and as a result, qualified for the NSL Championship final. The championship final was originally scheduled in a best-of-three series but was later changed to a two-game series.

"Take Me There" is a song by American quartet Blackstreet and singer Mýa. It also features Bad Boy rappers Mase and Blinky Blink. It was written by Mase, Michael Foster, Madeline Nelson, Tamara Savage and Teddy Riley. Riley also produced the song. The song serves as the theme song for the animated feature film The Rugrats Movie and was released on November 30, 1998, as the lead and only single from the soundtrack. It also appeared on Blackstreet's third studio album, Finally.
"Take Me There" reached 1 in New Zealand for three weeks in January 1999 and achieved platinum status for selling over 10,000 copies there. In North America, the song peaked at No. 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 21 on the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart. It also became a hit in several European nations, peaking at No. 7 in the United Kingdom, No. 9 in Ireland, and No. 22 in the Netherlands.
Background
Blackstreet initially became involved with The Rugrats Movie (1998) and its soundtrack after finding out that they were Nickelodeons favorite R&B group. Looking for other ways to tap into what was popular with children, Teddy Riley enlisted the help of Mýa and Mase. Riley explained, "It would appeal to the kids, and to get a more... broader audience of the kids, it would be great to have Mýa and Mase." This collaboration resulted in the song "Take Me There", which Riley produced, incorporating the Rugrats theme song. Backstage at the MTV Video Music Awards, Mýa talked about the collaboration, saying, "We knocked it out in one day. Kids came to the studio [to hear the song], and they were listening to the song and they were just singing right along, because [the song] rings a bell when you first hear it."
Composition
"Take Me There" is a pop-rap and R&B song with a soft melody. It runs for four minutes and four seconds. The full-length version, including the instrumental section, is five minutes and two seconds. It contains interpolations of the original Rugrats TV theme, which was composed by Mark Mothersbaugh (uncredited).
Music video
The music video premiered in October 1998. The video starts with cartoon character Angelica Pickles turning on the television to a clip of the Rugrats pulling the Reptar Wagon up a hill. The clip used appears to be the deleted scene "The Rugrats March". It takes place in a realistic live-action version of the Pickles' house, with Mýa and Blackstreet dancing through the house. Mýa is seen in Tommy Pickles's bedroom, the members of Blackstreet are seen in the kitchen, and Mase and Blinky Blink are seen driving the Reptar Wagon against a background of a scene from the film. As the video ends, Angelica turns the television off. The video premiered as a part of Blackstreet and Mýa's hosting of SNICK, and was directed by Luke Nola and Steve Saussey.
Reception
The single entered the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on December 5, 1998, peaking at No. 14 on January 23, 1999. It reached No. 10 on Billboards Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs chart. Internationally, it reached the top 10 in Ireland and the United Kingdom, and the top 20 in Japan. It also reached the top spot in New Zealand and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand. In 2014, Billboard ranked "Take Me There" in its "Top 50 Forgotten Gems From the Now! Series", which list songs from the series that were underrated at the time of their release.
Chart performance
The Rugrats Movie soundtrack was awarded a platinum certification in the United States for selling over one million copies. While the film's website credits sales to the strength of the major-label artists who participated, chart positions and sales correlate directly to the heavy promotions for the feature film's November 20, 1998, US release.
"Take Me There (Want U Back Mix)," which interpolates "I Want You Back" by The Jackson 5, peaked at No. 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 on December 19, 1998, after three weeks on the chart. That same day it made its way onto the top 40. During the week of December 7, 1998, "Take Me There" peaked at No. 13 on the Hits of the World board in the United Kingdom. The song landed on No. 19 of the Video Monitor, the most-played clips as monitored by the Broadcast Data Systems, via its airtime on BET. It also did very well on the MTV playlists, peaking at No. 21 in the same week. It was also well liked in The Clip List, making its debut on the Box Tops, and was played about 15 hours weekly on the California Music Channel (CMC).
Sound Tracks noted its popularity: The movie's success helped the soundtrack stay at No. 20 on the Billboard 200 chart for five weeks.
Remixes
One remix appears on Blackstreet's album Finally. This version omitted Mase and Blinky Blink, possibly because their verses primarily revolve around the Rugrats characters. It also appeared on The Rugrats Movie Soundtrack, which sampled the Jackson 5's number-one hit "I Want You Back", but it is not used in the film. It is available on the consumer CD version, which was issued in the United Kingdom in March 1999. A second remix, "Take Me There (Thugrats Remix)" appears on the "Girlfriend/Boyfriend" single featuring new verses from Mase and Blinky Blink.

The Royal Historical Commission (, ) of the Konbaung Dynasty of Burma (Myanmar) produced the standard court chronicles of Konbaung era, Hmannan Yazawin (1832) and Dutiya Yazawin (1869).
Commission (1829–1832)
In May 1829, three years after the disastrous First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826), King Bagyidaw created the first Royal Historical Commission to write an official chronicle of Konbaung Dynasty. The standard official chronicle at the time was Maha Yazawin (The Great Chronicle), the standard chronicle of Toungoo Dynasty that covers from time immemorial to October 1711. It was the second attempt by Konbaung kings to update Maha Yazawin. The first attempt, Yazawin Thit (The New Chronicle), commissioned by Bagyidaw's predecessor and grandfather Bodawpaya, had not been accepted because the new chronicle contained severe criticisms of earlier chronicles. Although it was Bodawpaya himself who had ordered the author of Yazawin Thit, Twinthin Taikwun, to verify the accuracy of Maha Yazawin by consulting a variety of sources including hundreds of inscriptions, the king did not accept the new chronicle when it was presented to him.
The members of the commission consisted of learned monks, court historians and court Brahmins: The commission first convened for the first time on 11 May 1829 (1st waxing of Nayon 1191 ME). Three years and four months later, the commission had brought up the history to 1821, producing Hmannan Yazawin.
Commission (1867–1869)
The second commission was formed in 1867. It was about 15 years after an even more disastrous Second Anglo-Burmese War (1852), and about a year after a serious rebellion that killed Crown Prince Kanaung Mintha. A shaken King Mindon commissioned another committee of scholars to update Hmannan. The commission consisted of five members—senior court officials, a librarian, and a scribe. Whereas the first commission had stopped short of the First Anglo-Burmese War, the second commission had no choice but to tackle the two disastrous wars that had their dismembered kingdom on the brink. The commission updated the chronicle up to 1854, right after the second war. The Second Chronicle's account of the two wars, according to historian Htin Aung, was "written with the objectivity of a true historian, and the great national defeats were described faithfully in detail." The second chronicle in ten volumes was completed in 1869.
