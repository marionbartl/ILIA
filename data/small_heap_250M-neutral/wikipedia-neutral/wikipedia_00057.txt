Aberdeen is a small town in the upper Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia, in Upper Hunter Shire. It is 12 kilometres north of Muswellbrook on the New England Highway.
History
In 1828 Thomas Potter McQueen was granted 10,000 acres, and named the small township after George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen. In 1837 Segenhoe Inn was built, which Potter McQueen named after Segenhoe Manor, in Bedfordshire, where they were born in 1791.
Aberdeen Post Office opened on 1 August 1856.
Population
According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 1,894 people in Aberdeen.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.7% of the population.
86.7% of people were born in Australia and 90.4% of people only spoke English at home.
The most common responses for religion were Anglican 34.3%, Catholic 28.2% and No Religion 17.9%.
Today
Aberdeen has its own pre-school, which was founded in 1977. The town contains two schools: the Aberdeen Public School, catering from kindergarten to Grade 6; and St. Joseph's High School, a Catholic co-educational high school catering for Grades 7 through to 12.
Aberdeen has two churches – St Thomas's Catholic Church, and St Mark's Anglican Church. It once had a third church, St Paul's Uniting Church, which has now been turned into an art gallery called the Artemis Gallery.
St Joseph's Aberdeen High School is located next to St Thomas's Catholic Church.
The town has a local rugby league team, the Aberdeen Tigers.
Aberdeen is on the Main North railway line, and is serviced by a daily XPLorer long-distance service in each direction between Sydney and Armidale, as well as two/three local services in each direction between Scone and Newcastle.
For travellers, there are two main areas for accommodation in the town: the Aberdeen Motel, which is on the southern edge of the town; and the Segenhoe Inn, which is situated towards the northern end of town. The Commercial Hotel is also available for budget accommodation.
Abattoirs
Aberdeen is possibly best known for the former abattoirs in the town centre ( that and Katherine Knight), which operated for well over 100 years, before the most recent owners - an American company called Conagra - decided to close down their New South Wales abattoirs and concentrate on their Queensland operations. One factor in closing down what was once a very important abattoir for Conagra, was that the financial cost of upgrading the Aberdeen Abattoir was deemed too high, thus the abattoir - which was the largest single employer in Aberdeen - was closed in 1999. Hundreds of people were left without work, and despite promises from both the New South Wales and Federal governments to encourage new businesses to open up in the area, nothing of note eventuated.

Judy Darcy (born 1950) is a Canadian health care advocate, trade unionist, and former politician. Darcy was the first Minister of Mental Health and Addictions of British Columbia. They were the fourth National President of the Canadian Union of Public Employees from 1991 until 2003, making them the second woman and second Jewish-Canadian person to hold the post, and business manager of the Hospital Employees' Union from 2005 to 2011.
Darcy was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the 2013 election, as a BC NDP candidate for the provincial constituency of New Westminster.
Early life
Darcy was born Ida Maria Judith Borunsky in Denmark and came to Canada with their parents when they were 18 months old. Them father was a research chemist who was a shipping clerk for years until they could re-establish their credentials in Canada and resume work in their profession.
Them father, Jules (Youli) Simonovich Borunsky, was a Russian Jew whose family had moved to France following the Russian Revolution. Borunsky's first wife was a French Catholic woman. During the war they enlisted in the French Army and was taken prisoner during the Battle of Dunkirk. During their detention as a Prisoner of war, they survived and avoided deportation to a concentration camp by hiding their Jewishness and pretending to be a devout Catholic, including Catholic references and symbols in their letters to their wife as part of the ruse. With Paris occupied by the Nazis, Borunsky convinced their father that it would be safer for them to join the rest of the family in Kovno, Lithuania. However, four days after they arrived, the town was invaded by the Nazis. Einsatzgruppen murdered most of the Jewish population, presumably including Borunsky's father, sister, their husband and their daughter. According to Darcy, their father "carried tremendous guilt, [t]he guilt of having survived when others died and the guilt of having sent their father to their death." Borunsky's first wife died of illness around the end of the war. Borunsky, after being liberated, worked as deputy director of a United Nations Refugee Agency displaced persons camp where they met Else Margrethe Rich, a veteran of the Danish resistance movement who found work on the staff of the camp after the war. Traumatized by the war and the loss of their family, and afraid of further anti-Semitic oppression, Borunsky continued to hide their Jewishness from everyone except for their wife until later life.
Borunsky and Rich married and moved to Denmark where Darcy was born in 1950. Darcy and their sister and brother were all baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church but were not raised in any faith. The family emigrated to Canada in 1951, and settled in Sarnia where Borunsky found work in the petrochemical industry. When they were 8, their parents changed the family's name to Darcy as their father wanted a French sounding name. After their retirement, their father started attending Holy Blossom Synagogue and the Bernard Betel Centre for Creative Living in order to rekindle their Jewish roots and gradually revealed their story to their children.
Darcy was raised in Sarnia, and moved to Toronto to study political science at York University but quit after 1½ years, but not before infiltrating and disrupting the Miss Canadian University Pageant yelling "It's true it's a meat market and they do exploit women!" as the winner was announced. After travelling and doing odd jobs, they became a University of Toronto library clerk in 1972 and became active in CUPE.
Union activism
In their youth, Darcy was active with the Workers' Communist Party of Canada, a Maoist group, and was a candidate for the party in the 1981 Ontario provincial election in the Toronto riding of St. Andrew—St. Patrick. By 1985, they had left the party and joined the New Democratic Party saying of their earlier radicalism ""I'm older, I don't think we're going to remake the world, but we've got to change what we can."
In 1983, they became a regional vice-president of the union's Ontario division and was also working at the Metropolitan Toronto Reference Library.
By the mid-1980s, they were president of the Metro Toronto Council of CUPE.
In 1986, they ran for the position of Ontario president of CUPE challenging 10-year incumbent Lucie Nicholson. They were unsuccessful, losing by a margin of 318-240, their defeat blamed on a red-baiting campaign by the union's leadership. Darcy, however, did manage to retain a spot on the union's executive board topping the slate of "member at large" positions.
By 1988, they were first vice-president of CUPE's Ontario division as well as a vice-president of the Ontario Federation of Labour. In 1989, they successfully ran for the position of national secretary-treasurer of CUPE, the union's number two position. saying that said they stand for strong leadership to help CUPE cope with "some of the incredibly difficult challenges we'll see in the next few years, especially in light of free trade."
In the 1988 federal election, Darcy was the NDP's candidate against Liberal Frank Stronach and Progressive Conservative John E. Cole in York—Simcoe placing a "distant third" in the suburban Toronto riding.
In 1991, they were elected CUPE national president taking over the 406,000 member trade union. By the time they retired 13 years later the union had grown to 525,000 members.
Electoral record
After CUPE
They moved to British Columbia subsequently and ran for the provincial British Columbia New Democratic Party nomination in Vancouver-Fairview but was upset by a business person Gregor Robertson by a margin of 76 votes on the second ballot.
In February 2005, Darcy returned to work in the trade union movement acquiring a position as secretary-business manager and chief negotiator with British Columbia's Hospital Employees' Union. They were known as being on the left of the union and an advocate of issues such as employment equity and childcare. They resigned from this position in September 2011 in preparation for their candidacy in the 2013 BC provincial election in New Westminster. They celebrated their election as New Westminster's Member of the Legislative Assembly at the Heritage Grill. At this party, Darcy led attendees in chanting "NDP".

, provisional designation , is a Jupiter trojan from the Greek camp, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 18 October 1998, by astronomers with the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search at the Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, in the United States. The dark Jovian asteroid is a slow rotator with a long rotation period of potentially 400 hours. It has not been named since its numbering in January 2000.
Orbit and classification
is a dark Jovian asteroid in a 1:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter. It is located in the leading Greek camp at the Gas Giant's Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of its orbit . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7–5.8 AU once every 11 years and 12 months (4,367 days; semi-major axis of 5.23 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in February 1954, more than 44 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.
Numbering and naming
This minor planet was numbered by the MPC on 24 January 2000 (). As of 2018, it has not been named.
Physical characteristics
is an assumed C-type asteroid, while larger Jupiter trojans are D-types.
Rotation period
In August 2015, a first rotational lightcurve of was obtained from photometric observations by the Kepler space telescope during its K2 mission. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.23 magnitude (). One month later, a second, lower-rated lightcurve by Kepler determined an alternative period of hours with an amplitude of 0.20 (). As of 2018, no secure period of this slow rotator has yet been obtained.
Diameter and albedo
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, measures 33.30 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.058, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 32.03 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.2.

The Cunningham C-3 is a Grand tourer, designed and built by the B. S. Cunningham Company beginning in 1952. Intended primarily as a road car, enough C3 were meant to be built to homologate Briggs Cunningham's racing cars, making them eligible to race at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
History
To have their namesake cars homologated as a manufacturer for Le Mans, Cunningham needed to build 25 examples of the C-3.
Two pre-production cars similar in appearance to the C-2Rs were built at the company's West Palm Beach location; a roadster with chassis number 5205, and a coupe with chassis number 5206X. A third chassis, number 5206, was sent to the workshops of carrozzeria Vignale in Turin, Italy, where it received a new coupe body styled by designer Giovanni Michelotti, then working at Vignale. The factory considered chassis 5026 the official prototype, and subsequent cars received the Michelotti body style.
Twenty-seven C-3s were built. One reference reports eighteen coupes and nine convertibles. Others report twenty coupes and five convertibles with bodies by Vignale, plus the two cars bodied at the West Palm Beach factory. While early factory pricing was US$8,000 (US$ in dollars) for a Sports Convertible, and US$9,000 (US$) for a Coupe, the cost of a C-3 had risen to US$15,000 (US$) by 1951.
The New York Museum of Modern Art named the C-3 Continental Coupé one of the "10 Best Contemporary Automobiles".
When production of the C-3 ended, fourteen chassis in various states of completion remained. In 1955 during a disbursement of parts by Hilltop Trailer Sales, Chassis #5235 was purchased by Jack Shakespeare of Indiana. In 1957 subsequent owner John Hanley of Wisconsin commissioned a custom body designed by someone from Brooks Stevens Design Associates, which was fabricated by Bob Jones of Indianapolis.
Technical details
The engine in the C-3 is the Chrysler FirePower V8 that Cunningham had first used in the C-2Rs, but now with a new intake manifold and four Zenith single-barrel carburetors, and a dual exhaust system. This raised power to from the factory version's .
The majority of cars received one of two different transmissions offered; the first four cars had a three-speed manual from Cadillac, while subsequent cars used Chrysler's Presto-Matic semi-automatic fluid-coupled two-speed with electric overdrive, for an effective selection of four forward ratios. An exception was chassis 5223, which received a Chrysler PowerFlite transmission.
The C-3's large-diameter tube chassis was similar to that of the earlier C-2R, but the racing car's De Dion tube rear suspension was replaced by a coil-sprung live axle located by an upper and lower trailing arm on each side.

Leonard Firby Edmondson (16 December 1912 – 20 November 2006) was a British trade unionist.
Born in Gateshead, Edmondson was educated at Gateshead Central School, leaving at the age of fifteen. After two years of unemployment and short-term work, they completed an apprenticeship as a fitter with the Concrete Liner Company. They joined the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) and worked for a large number of businesses around the Tyne, generally acting as a shop flight attendant. They were considered a highly skilled negotiator, who persuaded companies to introduce apprenticeships for machinists, and limit overtime.
In 1934, Edmondson joined the National Unemployed Workers Movement and, through this, joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP), remaining a member until the late 1940s, and identifying as being on the left-wing of the trade union movement for the rest of their life. They campaigned in support of the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, and for maintenance of working conditions during World War II. In 1943, they were elected to the union's Tyneside District Committee, and in 1953 they became the full-time district secretary.
In 1966, Edmondson was elected to the executive committees of both the AEU and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions (CSEU); they were president of the CSEU in 1976/77. They were also elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, in 1970, serving for eight years. In addition, they served on the Shipbuilding Industry Training Board, the council of Acas, the Royal Commission on Legal Services, Council on Tribunals, Gypsy Council, and Committee of Inquiry into Prison Services.
Edmondson retired from their union work in 1977, and from their remaining roles by 1984, spending their retirement breeding and showing Shetland Sheepdogs, and enjoyed attending the Appleby Horse Fair.

Bealings railway station was a station in Little Bealings, Suffolk on the line between Ipswich and Lowestoft. It was down the line from Ipswich. While the station was shut on 17 September 1956, the line remains open, and both the station building and platforms survive.
It was opened by the Eastern Union Railway (EUR) on 1 June 1859 when the full East Suffolk Line opened between Great Yarmouth in Norfolk and Ipswich in Suffolk. The station buildings were designed by Frederick Barnes (architect), who also designed Woodbridge station. By the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most (including the EUR) were leased to the Eastern Counties Railway; they wished to amalgamate formally, but could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway was formed by amalgamation.
Thus in 1862 the operation of Bealings Station was taken over by the Great Eastern Railway who operated the station until 1923 when grouping saw the Great Eastern Railway taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway.
The July 1922 Bradshaw's Guide showed seven up services (towards Ipswich) and seven down services calling at the station, with two services each way on Sundays. Most services were local trains which would originate or terminate at Ipswich and call at most stations on the East Suffolk Line. However the station did enjoy a main line service direct to Liverpool Street. Bradshaw's stated that the 08:17 departure conveyed first and third class Pullman carriages (there was no second class at this time), arriving in Liverpool Street at 10:30. The return working was at 15:18, arriving back in Bealings at 17:22.
From 1916 the station was the railhead for Martlesham Heath Airfield. In 1919 the goods yard was recorded as having three roads one of which served a small goods shed (the building on the left-hand side of the picture).
After World War 2 the railways were nationalised and Bealings station became part of British Railways' Eastern Region. Lack of patronage saw the station close in September 1956 and the goods yard followed in April 1965. The signal box (opened in 1884 with 18 levers for signals and points) remained in use, however, as a block post to divide up the Westerfield-Woodbridge section and to operate the level crossing gates. The box lasted until 1984, when it was closed as a result of the introduction of RETB (Radio Electronic Token Block) signalling on the East Suffolk line; at the same time, the manual level crossing gates were replaced by the current automatic half-barriers. The station building is still extant today, and is occupied by the Mallard Business Centre.

The 1979 Detroit Tigers finished in fifth place in the American League East with a record of 85-76, 18 games behind the Orioles. They outscored their opponents 770 to 738. The Tigers drew 1,630,929 fans to Tiger Stadium in 1979, ranking 7th of the 14 teams in the American League. This season is most notable for both the Tigers' involvement in the infamous Disco Demolition Night, of which they were the visiting team to the Chicago White Sox and declared winners by forfeit, as well as for their mid-season hiring of Sparky Anderson as manager. Anderson would manage the Tigers through the end of the 1995 season, winning the 1984 World Series along with two American League Eastern Division titles in 1984 and 1987.

La Vieille Fille (The Old Maid or An Old Maid) is a novel by the French writer Honoré de Balzac. Written in 1836, it was first published as a serial in La Presse, then published by Edmond Werdet in 1837 in Études de mœurs, in the section les Scènes de la vie de province. La Vieille Fille was republished in 1839 by éditions Charpentier, before being published alongside le Cabinet des Antiques in the isolated les Rivalités group within Scènes de la vie de province in la Comédie humaine, published in 1844 by édition Furne.
The work was dedicated to Balzac's brother in law, an engineer in the corps royal des ponts et chaussées, Eugène Midy de la Greneraye Surville. Even so, Balzac offered its manuscript to comtesse Guidoboni-Visconti, in 1844.
This short and incisive novel stands out for the density of its story and its rapid succession of events. Balzac takes time to carefully describe the house of Mademoiselle Cormon, the old maid, in the city of Alençon, before entering directly into the heart of the matter.
The portrait of Mademoiselle Cormon is one of the most successful in The Human Comedy. Balzac delivers in this novel one of their most nuanced analysis of a provincial town's social, political and financial affairs.

The NER Class 290 (LNER Class J77) was a class of 0-6-0T steam locomotives of the North Eastern Railway (NER), rebuilt from an earlier class of 0-4-4T, the NER Bogie Tank Passenger (BTP, later LNER Class G6).
History
Large numbers of the NER G6 0-4-4WT class were made redundant during the 1890s. Forty of these were rebuilt as 0-6-0T shunting locomotives at York Works between 1899 and 1904. Ten further were rebuilt at Darlington, in 1907-8 and a further ten in 1921.
Equipment
The G6 BTP were built with Westinghouse brakes. These were replaced with steam brakes on all but two of the J77s (Nos. 37 and 1437). These were removed in the late 1930s. Twelve of the J77s received vacuum brakes after 1945. This fitting was usually accompanied by the addition of carriage heating equipment.
Use
They were used for general shunting and marshalling coal trains. Withdrawals started in 1933 but 45 survived into British Railways ownership in 1948. Their BR numbers were 68390-68440 (with gaps).
Withdrawal
Most were withdrawn during the 1950s and replaced by diesel shunters. The last J77 to be withdrawn was No. 68408 of South Blyth in February 1961. None were preserved.

Marina South is a planning area located within the Central Area of the Central Region of Singapore. It is largely home to Gardens by the Bay as well as the Marina Barrage. The name has also been used to refer to the larger peninsula the planning area is situated on, which encompasses the planning areas of Straits View and a portion of the Downtown Core.
Marina South is bordered by Marina East to the north and northeast, Straits View to the southwest, the Downtown Core to the north and west, as well as the Singapore Straits to the south and east.
History
Reclaimation and leisure activities in the 1990s
Land at Marina Centre and Marina South was reclaimed from the sea to form a sheltered body of water that came to be known as Marina Bay. It was aimed to provide additional land near the Central Business District. After allowing for the reclaimed land to settle, the area was developed to allow kite flying and the playing of soccer as an interim measure.
A park known as Marina City Park was opened on 30 December 1990, was planned to be a premier park of Singapore's proposed "city of the 21st century". Commercial districts were also constructed to allow outdoor dining, bowling alleys and gaming arcades. In its hey-day back in the early 1990s, teenagers flocked to the area as there used to be Singapore's only Cantonese discothèqueCanto. All of these were closed in the mid-2000s as redevelopment was planned for the area.
Re-development
A new ferry terminal, Marina South Pier, was built there to replace the old Clifford Pier at Collyer Quay, it was opened on 1 April 2006.
The Marina City Park was later closed from 1 June 2007 for the Gardens by the Bay's site preparatory works.
An integrated resort, Marina Bay Sands, was built on the northern shore of Marina South which was completed in 2010. It is situated next to the Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Financial Centre, which was completed in 2013.
The new Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore, was built and opened in October 2012. It is located next to the current Marina South Pier. It has the capability to accommodate some of the world's largest ships. The addition of the new cruise centre helps to boost the growth of the leisure cruise sector in Singapore, apart from the Singapore Cruise Centre.
Future
Marina South was first identified by the URA in 2013 as a car-lite high density residential district next to the new Central Business District at Marina Bay, Singapore. The precinct, which can yield more than 10,000 homes, will also feature retail, office and hotel uses, creating a self-sufficient community. It will also form part of the Greater Southern Waterfront.
The first land parcel, a residential plot on Marina Gardens Lane, will be released for sale in December 2022.
Transport
Marina South is served by two stations, Marina Bay and Bayfront, part of the Circle Line Extension and serves Marina Bay Sands integrated resort. The Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE) will link the area with the nationwide network of expressways, enhancing accessibility of the area.
The Marina South and Gardens by the Bay MRT stations on the Thomson–East Coast MRT line will serve Marina South in the future, with the former opening in tandem with developments near it.

Club Tilcara is an Argentine rugby union and field hockey club sited in Paraná, Entre Ríos. The rugby union team is affiliated to Unión Entrerriana and competes in tournaments organised by the body. The squad also plays in the Torneo del Litoral organised by the Unión de Rugby de Rosario.
History
Club Tilcara was founded in 1954 by workers of the Portland cement factory of Paraná, along with former members of the Paraná Rowing Club.
The club was named honoring the Pucará de Tilcara, a pre-Inca fortification in nearby Jujuy. Other versions say that the Club Pucará had been punished with 99 years of suspension due to political issues, and Tilcara decided to adopt its name joining the Pucará's cause.
The first match played by Tilcara was against Obras Sanitarias, which was the Buenos Aires champion at the time. Obras defeated Tilcara 22-3.
For a while the club would be nicknamed "the Gypsies" as it would move from location to location during the first years of its existence. After almost twenty years of this, the club would finally acquire its own installations on Route 18, in 1975.
For the last 30 years Tilcara has been one of the most successful teams in Entre Rios, as such Tilcara takes part in the inter-provincial Torneo del Litoral. Before the creation of this tournament in 2000, the unions of Santa Fe and Entre Rios organised their own regional competition (confusingly called Torneo del Litoral as well) which Tilcara won on 4 occasions.
Tilcara's main rival is Estudiantes de Paraná.

Upton, Pembrokeshire is a small, rural parish in Pembrokeshire, Wales, in which Upton Castle and Upton Chapel are significant buildings dating back to Norman times.
History
An early mention of the parish was about 1200, when Gerald of Wales recorded a chapel there, subordinate to Nash parish. The Manor of Upton merged with that of Nash under the 14th century Malefants, who had built the castle probably in the 13th century. By the 16th century, the Bowen family owned the manor. The parish is marked on a 1578 parish map of the county.
In the second half of the 18th century, Captain John Tasker of the East India Company purchased Upton Castle; among the eventual beneficiaries after their death were members of the Evans family. In 1833, Lewis, in their Topographical Dictionary of Wales, recorded that the parish was occupied by a single family of six inhabitants. At that time Nash-cum-Upton was a rectory in the non-adjoining Nash parish, to the south. Lewis described the former inhabitants of the castle and its dependencies as Maliphant (sic), then Bowen, then Evans. In 1872, Upton was described as a hamlet in Nash parish, with a population of 24 in three houses. It covered an area of , of which were water.
Tasker Evans sold to Stanley Neale in 1927. The asking price was £9,100.
In 2004, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park said they would discontinue the upkeep of the gardens. In 2006 the estate was sold. In 2012, Channel 4's Time Team carried out an archaeological evaluation of the castle and chapel. Their evidence suggested the chapel was 11th or 12th century, subsequently altered.
Modern maps show only Upton Farm, Upton Castle Gardens and the ruins of Upton Castle and Chapel.
Upton Castle
Upton Castle was the home of the Malefant family, and later of John Tasker. It is still a private home. Its gardens are open to the public.
Upton Chapel
The chapel is dedicated to St. Giles, and is open to the public. It contains several important features including effigies of the Anglo-Norman Malefant family dating from the 13th to 15th centuries.

The Hanriot H.43 was a military utility aircraft produced in France in the late 1920s and early 1930s which was primarily used by the Aéronautique Militaire as a trainer. While Hanriot had spent most of the 1920s manufacturing further and further developments of the HD.14 that had flown in 1920, the H.43 was an entirely new design. It was a conventional single-bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span and a fuselage of fabric-covered metal tube. Accommodation for the pilot and passenger was in tandem, open cockpits and the main units of the fixed, tailskid undercarriage were linked by a cross-axle.
Design and Development
Two prototypes in 1927 were followed by the LH.431 in 1928, a much-modified version that dispensed with the sweepback used on both the upper and lower wings of the H.43, had a new tail fin and added metal covering to the sides of the fuselage. This was ordered into production by the Aéronautique Militaire, which ordered 50 examples. These were slightly different again from the LH.431 prototype, having divided main undercarriage units, wings of slightly greater area, and redesigned interplane struts.
Operational history
From 1927 to 1933, the Army would purchase nearly 150 examples for a variety of support roles including training, liaison, observation, and as an air ambulance. At the Fall of France in 1940, 75 of these aircraft remained in service.
H.43 variants were also operated by civil flying schools in France, as well as 12 examples purchased for the military of Peru
Variants
H.43 – prototype with Salmson CM.9 engine (2 built)
H.430 – version with Salmson 9Ab engine (1 under construction but never completed)
H.431.01 – development of H.430 with revised wings, fin, and fuselage and Lorraine 7Ma engine (1 built)
LH.431 – production version with divided main undercarriage units and Lorraine 7Mc engine (62 built)
LH.432 – gunnery training version with machine gun on ring mount in rear cockpit (1 built, plus 1 converted from LH.431)
LH.433 – revised LH.431 with modified landing gear and tail fin, and Lorraine 7Me engine (26 built)
LH.434 – (1 built)
H.436 – dedicated trainer version based on LH.433 with Salmson 9Ab engine (50 built)
LH.437 – air ambulance version based on LH.433 (1 built, plus one converted from LH.431)
LH.437ter – air ambulance version with Salmson engine (1 converted from LH.437. Subsequently converted back and redesignated H.437/1).
H.438 – export version of LH.433 for Peru (12 built)

PeaceKeeper Cause-Metics is a cosmetics company with a line of products for which all profits, after taxes, are used to support women's health advocacy and human rights issues, while educating the mass consumer about many issues within the Human Rights field. The Company, Wisdom Says, was registered by CEO Jody Weiss as a S-Corporation in the State of California in May 1999. Wisdom Says registered the name "PeaceKeeper" as a trademark in February 2001 stating that "the very act of buying a product for which all profits support women's health advocacy & urgent human rights issues would transform the buyer into a PeaceKeeper herself". The company is currently holding a Kiss Campaign to raise money for women and girls who have left indentured servitude and sex trafficking. Weiss says "The ethos behind the company is to invite women to be proactive, to use their discretionary income to make spending decisions that contribute directly to promoting gender equality
and ending violence".

Squaw Humper Dam is a dam on Tahc'a Okute Wakpa (formerly Squaw-Humper Creek) in Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota, in the United States. It is located within Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, the lands of the Oglala Lakota Nation.
The name has generated a degree of controversy for containing the term squaw, which is often held to be pejorative. While the Oglala Lakota successfully changed the name of the stream in federal usage, a proposal to rename the dam to Tahc'a Okute Mni Onaktake did not succeed. At the time, there were concerns expressed that the proposed name would be difficult for the general public to pronounce.

Cindertalk is the stage and studio name of multi-instrumentalist singer-songwriter Jonny Rodgers, and the ever-changing group of musicians who join them for performances and recordings.  They are best known for their skill in playing an array of tuned wine glasses (also known as glass harp) along with guitar, keyboards and loop pedals and has contributed to numerous albums and film scores.
Biography
Jonny Rodgers took the name Cindertalk in 2014 to differentiate themselves from the other artists and musicians with similar names. The term "cindertalk" refers to the sound of live coals hidden in the ashes of the early morning fires they light each day to warm their Oregon cottage.
Cindertalk's songs and live show are based around the combination of tuned wine glasses, guitar, loops, electronics and vocals. The New York Times' Allan Kozinn called Cindertalk's live show "a stunning demonstration of what can be done with tuned wine glasses.”
Jonny is also a composer and producer, writing chamber, orchestral and choral music for concert and film. Their most recent film credits include providing guitar for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's "Don Jon", glass and glass samples on "The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby" and they wrote the complete score for indie film My Brother Jack.
Jonny's formative musical years were spent writing, touring and recording with their brother Steve Rodgers in the indie band Mighty Purple. The band released seven albums and toured the US multiple times. Literature and art run in Jonny's family including novelists and authors like their grandfather Joseph Chilton Pearce and great-uncle Richard Yates.
Jonny collaborates with many renowned musicians from the worlds of classical and indie music. They have played for the bands Son Lux, NYC's classical-crossover band Awry (now My Brightest Diamond), Ten Shekel Shirt, Faux Fix, Todd Reynolds, Sxip Shirey, Arturo En El Barco, Angélica Negrón and many others. They have also collaborated with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's open-collaborative production company HitRECord.
Their latest album, Everything All at Once prominently features tuned wine glasses, guitars and electronics with loops used in unexpected and captivating ways. The album was released on Oct 8, 2013 on [Epitonic] and Jonny subsequently toured the US with Radical Face.
For Record Store Day 2014, Cindertalk will be releasing a limited edition 7" vinyl called Spero which will help support Love146 and their efforts to end child trafficking and modern slavery.
Jonny currently splits their time between Brooklyn, New Haven, CT and a farm in Oregon.

Sinaida Rosenthal (22 February 1932 – 21 November 1988) was a German biochemist and molecular biologist. They worked as a professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin and thereafter, until their death, as department head of the Central Institute for Microbiology at the Berlin based German Academy of Sciences.
Life
Sinaida Gejelka was born in Berlin where, between 1950 and 1955, they studied Medicine at the Humboldt University. Around this time they married the virologist Hans-Alfred Rosenthal. It was also at the Humboldt that they received their doctorate, in 1960, for a dissertation entitled "Protein Release from Rat Liver Mitochondria" ("Eiweißfreisetzung aus Rattenlebermitochondrien"), and later, in 1969, their habilitation (higher level qualification) for which they were supervised by Samuel Mitja Rapoport. On this occasion their dissertation was entitled "On the Mechanism of Ribosome break down in Rabbit Reticulocytes" (" Über den Mechanismus des Ribosomenabbaus von Kaninchenretikulozyten").
In 1969, still at the Humboldt, they were appointed Professor for Physiology and Biology. In 1972 they switched to the Central Institute for Microbiology at the German Academy of Sciences in Buch, a district on the north-east of Berlin. They would remain here, in charge of the Genetics Department, till their death. They died as a result of cancer in 1988.
Work and recognition
The focus of Rosenthal's research was on molecular biological and genetic aspects of physiology and on the application of genetic engineering.
In 1972 they became a corresponding member of the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin. Two years later they were accepted as a full member. From 1983 they were also a corresponding member of the East Germany Academy of Agri-sciences.

Swaga Swaga Game Reserve is a Tanzanian game reserve located in northwest Dodoma Region, that gives refuge to elephants and other vulnerable animals. It is located 50.6 miles from the city of Babati.
It covers an area of 871 square kilometers.
Swaga Swaga also contains 102 lions, and since Tanzania has the most lions in Africa, Swaga Swaga has almost 0.6% of Tanzania's sighted lions.
In 2017, the Tanzania Wildlife Management Authority (TAWA) began an action to relocate many animal species from other reserves to improve fauna diversity. In this they see a great chance for the development of tourism and the promotion of Swaga Swaga.
In February 2021, Polish archaeologist from Jagiellonian University announced the discovery of ancient rock art with anthropomorphic figures in a good condition at the Amak'hee 4 rockshelter site. Paintings made with a reddish dye also contained buffalo heads, giraffe's head and neck, domesticated cattle dated back to about several hundred years ago. Archaeologists estimated that these paintings can describe a ritual of the Sandawe people, although their present religion does not contain elements of anthropomorphization of buffaloes.

Centerförlaget (first known as Seriemagasinet Förlag) was a Swedish comic book publishing company that operated from 1948 to 1970. It is considered the first Swedish comics publisher. A division of the Swedish magazine king T. Armas Morby's company Press & Publicity AB, the company mainly published translated versions of American and European comics.
The company's first title, and one of its longest-lasting, was Seriemagasinet (The Comic Strip Magazine), launched in 1948 and running more than 818 issues. Other long-running titles included the Western titles Min melodi (My Melody) (534 issues, 1949–1962), Cowboy (659 issues, 1951–1970), Vilda västern (Wild West) (863 issues, 1952–1969), and Prärieserier (Prairie Series) (767 issues, 1953–1968). Most of these comics were originally published in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Italy.
Seriemagasinet Förlag changed its name to Centerförlaget 1956; by this time the company controlled 30% of Sweden's comic book market.
The company published translated versions of the DC/National superhero titles Superman (launched in 1949), Batman (1951), and Superboy (1959), as well as the Western title Tomahawk (1951). In 1969, Williams Förlags AB, the Swedish comics and magazines publishing division of Warner Communications — at that time the corporate owner of DC — re-acquired and continued publishing those titles.
In 1970 Centerförlaget was acquired by Semic Press; most titles were cancelled but a few were continued by Semic, including Hacke Hackspett (Woody Woodpecker), Buster, Serie-nytt, and the long-running Seriemagasinet. (In 1975, Semic acquired Williams Förlags AB, continuing the DC superhero/Western titles Centerförlaget had launched in the 1950s.)

Eight matches took place at the event. In the main event, Jay Lethal defeated Jay Briscoe to retain the ROH World Championship in their rematch since last year's event. Other prominent matches were B. J. Whitmer defeating Steve Corino in a non-sanctioned fight without honor (originally scheduled for Final Battle 2015, but because Corino's neck surgery and Whitmer's knee injury, it took place at Best in the World '16) after the interference of Kevin Sullivan, The Addiction (Christopher Daniels & Frankie Kazarian) retaining the ROH World Tag Team Championships against The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley & Chris Sabin), the Bullet Club (The Young Bucks (Matt & Nick Jackson) & Adam Cole) defeating War Machine (Hanson & Raymond Rowe) & Moose and Mark Briscoe defeating Roderick Strong.

Storylines
Best in the World '16 featured professional wrestling matches that involved wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that played out on ROH's primary television program, Ring of Honor Wrestling. Wrestlers portrayed heroes or villains as they followed a series of events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Ixtlán de Juárez is a town and municipality in the Mexican state of Oaxaca about 65 km north of the city of Oaxaca on Federal Highway 175 towards Veracruz.
It is part of the Ixtlán District in the Sierra Norte de Oaxaca region.
Administrative areas
Municipality of Ixtlán
The municipality of Ixtlán de Juárez includes the town, and in addition the settlements of San Juan Yagila, Santa Cruz Yagavila, Santa María Yahuiche, Santa María Zoogochi, Santiago Teotlasco, Santo Domingo Cacalotepec, San Gaspar Yagalaxi, San Miguel Tiltepec, Santa María Josaa, La Luz, La Josefina and La Palma. The population of the town in the 2005 census was 2,479, and of the entire municipality, 7,188. Other than the town of Ixtlán, none of the settlements have as many as a thousand inhabitants.
Rincón de Ixtlán
The Rincón de Ixtlán is an area largely within the municipality of Ixtlán de Juárez. It comprises nine communities, eight of them within the municipality of Ixtlán (the ninth, San Pedro Yaneri, is a small independent municipality). The Rincón does not include the town of Ixtlán or other communities on the main road. This remote and culturally homogeneous area is one of the most intensely indigenous in the whole of Mexico, and has therefore been the subject of considerable sociological study.
History
The town of Ixtlán existed before the Spanish Conquest of Mexico. It is thought to have been founded in the latter half of the 15th century, by Zapotec people from the region around Tarabundi and San Pedro Laduu (though there are also neolithic remains in the area). The first settlers were probably warriors establishing a defensive outpost against Aztec invaders. In 1859 Ixtlán was the site of a battle during the Reform War between liberal and conservative forces. Some of the other communities in the municipality are probably several centuries older than the town of Ixtlán.
San Pablo Guelatao, the birthplace of Benito Juárez, lies 4 km from the town of Ixtlán and at the time of their birth fell within its jurisdiction, so Juárez was baptised in the church of St Thomas in Ixtlán; hence their name has been added to that of the town (in 1824, however, Guelatao declared itself independent of Ixtlán, and it remains an independent municipality.) The addition of Juárez's name serves the additional purpose of distinguishing the town from the many other Ixtláns in Mexico: the name is usually claimed to come from Aztec words meaning "land of the maguey", and use of the maguey (otherwise known as the century plant) was widespread in pre-Columbian Mexico. An alternative proposed derivation is from Mixtec words meaning "place of obsidian", and the town uses a logo that depicts an object made of obsidian.
Economy
Ixtlán is now a centre for eco-tourism. Its location, surrounded by cloud forest and pine and oak woodlands (which are forested sustainably) gives it great natural landscape beauty, and the forests of the Sierra Juárez mountains are claimed to be home to around 500 bird species and 6000 plant species.
Tours are operated from the village, and accommodation is available.
Hiking trails link it to neighbouring towns and villages in the Sierra Norte. It is accessible by the bus service that connects Oaxaca and Veracruz along Federal Highway 175. The land is held in common, but for a time in the late 20th century, a Mexican national paper manufacturer held a concession to harvest its forests. However, when the concession expired, the local communities denied the company any extensions and the forests are now managed communally in order to ensure that they are sustainable.
Principal agricultural crops in the municipality of Ixtlán are maize and coffee, with a small amount of land given over to sugarcane and other crops. Fair trade marketing has made a substantial difference to the coffee growers in this area.
Higher education
As a rural mountainous region, higher education had previously not been readily available to the populace. In April 2005 the government of the state of Oaxaca established the Universidad de la Sierra Juárez to help further the development and education of citizens in the Sierra Norte region. Currently the university offers degrees in the fields of natural sciences, sociology and humanities. UNSIJ also encourages four core academic activities among its students, including: teaching, research, cultural enrichment, and promotion of regional development.

The Connolly Youth Movement (, often abbreviated as CYM ) is an all-Ireland Marxist–Leninist youth organisation. It is a member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. It takes its name from the revolutionary socialist James Connolly.
History and current status
The CYM was founded in 1963 by young republicans who were influenced by the Communist Party during the Dublin Housing Action struggle. In 1970 with the merger of the Irish Workers' Party and Communist Party of Northern Ireland, to form the Communist Party of Ireland, the Northern Ireland Young Communist League joined the CYM, with Madge Davison as its general secretary. The CYM disbanded in 1991 due to a reduction in membership following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and eastern and central European bloc and the resulting political crisis in the World Communist Movement. However, following the resurgence of the left and anti-capitalist movement in Ireland, the CYM re-formed in 2002, grouped mainly around young members of the Dublin Branch of the CPI and student activists in NUI (National University of Ireland), Galway. The Connolly Youth Movement has relations with a number of young communist organisations around the world. The Connolly Youth Movement attends the :Meeting of European Communist Youth Organizations (MECYO).
The CYM supported the programme of the Communist Party of Ireland until a vote of the membership rescinded it at an Extraordinary Ard Fheis on 9 January 2021. In February 2021, the Communist Party of Ireland issued a statement stating that several dual (CPI-CYM) members had been expelled for alleged breaches of discipline and factional behaviour within the CPI prior to the CYM's decision to drop its support for the programme of the CPI.
Activities
In 2017, members of the Cork branch of the Connolly Youth Movement occupied and re-purposed three derelict buildings near UCC as part of an initiative to highlight rising levels of homelessness. In 2018, two of these buildings were repossessed by the Garda Emergency Response Unit acting in conjunction with a contractor for the O'Dwyer Asset Management Company that owned the vacant properties. The first occupation, still ongoing as of 2021, is referred to as Connolly Barracks by the organisation.
The Connolly Youth Movement was involved in highly publicised instances of direct action in 2018 and 2019 when members of the movement disrupted Fine Gael public meetings in Cork in protest of government policy in relation to homelessness and wealth inequality. One such action was criticised by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who stated "I think no matter what political party you come from or what your political views, we should all be committed to democracy and freedom of speech and trying to shout other people down and trying to shut down their meetings is profoundly anti-democratic". The organisation responded that it had a right to challenge and question the government on policy issues. In a March 2020 interview, then CYM General Secretary Alex Homits stated "Socialism will not and cannot be delivered through the ballot box and the CYM and its membership will not lie about this or endorse those who do."
Policies and Ideology
The CYM is constitutionally a socialist-republican and Marxist-Leninist organisation. In July 2022 it published a new programme, Cause of Youth, Cause of Ireland. It also released a ten point programme expressing a commitment to Irish unity, civil rights, the revival of Irish culture, free education, action on climate change, promotion of the Irish language, free healthcare on an all-Ireland basis, a public housing programme, international solidarity, and "a comprehensive system of worker's rights".
In 2020 the CYM's then General Secretary Alex Homits stated that "poverty and trafficking are the leading creators of sex workers." The CYM have offered solidarity to those engaged in sex work, and support for decriminalisation of the purchase of sex.
Publications
The CYM irregularly publishes a print magazine titled Forward, with online articles published under the same title.

The 2020 Clare Senior Football Championship was the 125th staging of the Clare Senior Football Championship since its establishment by the Clare County Board in 1887. The championship was postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic in Ireland. The draw for the opening round fixtures eventually took place on 1 July 2020. The championship began on 1 August 2020 and is scheduled to end in September 2020.
The 2020 champions, and holders of the Jack Daly Cup are Kilmurry-Ibrickane who won their sixteenth overall title.
Format Change
Time constraints led to a revision of the championship format. The group stages were abolished and any amalgamations withdrawn. The championship saw six first-round games with the winners of these ties being drawn against each other in the quarter final stage. The losers of the first round faced off against each other in order to produce one semi-finalist. Open draws applied to all rounds. There will be no relegation.

The original fixture between Clondegad and Cratloe was postponed due to an outbreak of COVID-19 within both the Cratloe and Clondegad GAA communities. After an emergency meeting of the Clare County Board it was agreed to postpone any game that the Cratloe Senior and Junior, and Clondegad Junior teams were due to play by a period of two weeks. All subsequent games involving these clubs or their conquerors would also be delayed down the line due to this decision. This would allow sufficient time for those affected to recover before returning to play.

A community of purpose is a community of people who are going through the same process or journey to achieve a similar, often emergent, objective.
From user-generated reviews or collaborative filtering on a site such as Amazon.com which help people decide what to buy to the reputation system at eBay which gives users a sense of who they're dealing with before they transact, the community fuels collective accomplishment. The impact of a given community of purpose is directly proportional to the potential of its participants to get something done. To achieve impact, communities need the right scale (number of participants), the right level of engagement (participation and involvement) and the right collective capability in relation to the declared 'purpose' of the community. Effective communities of practice achieve a balancing act between offering the right capabilities and ensuring sufficient capacity to deliver efficiently. Communities of Purpose can address a collective need, rather than a self-interest or defined goal typical of Communities of Practice and other forms of community, and can often generate unexpected results. Consequently, true communities of purpose are often an example of a complex adaptive system, unpredictable and among the least explored community vehicles / digital or physical communities.

Border Zone is an interactive fiction video game written by Marc Blank and published by Infocom in 1987. It was released for DOS, Apple II, Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, and Macintosh. Unlike most other purely text-based games, Border Zone incorporates real-time aspects of gameplay. It is also Infocom's thirtieth game. Its tagline is "Action and international intrigue behind the Iron Curtain."
Plot
Mirroring the real-world tension of the Cold War in the 1980s, Border Zone is set in and around Ostnitz, located on the border between the Eastern Bloc nation of Frobnia and neutral Litzenburg. The celebration of "Constitution Day" in Ostnitz will include a speech by Litzenburg's American ambassador; there is a plot in motion, however, to assassinate the ambassador in an effort to provoke hostilities between the superpowers. Border Zone consists of three chapters, each of which places the player in the role of a different character. An American business person, a KGB agent, and an American spy become entangled in the assassination plot and efforts to either stop it or ensure its success.
The tension is increased by the introduction of real-time events in the game. Unusual for a text adventure, game time continues to pass even as the computer waits for the player's next input. Certain actions, such as sneaking past a guard post, must be timed carefully to succeed.
Feelies
Besides the high quality of their interactive fiction games, Infocom was also known for feelies: extra items included in each game package related to the story, and sometimes used as copy protection. The Border Zone feelies included:
I Am Frobnia, a "Fortunate Tourists Guide and Phrasebook"
A business card from "Riznik's Antiques, Rare Books and Curios" (In Historic Ostnitz for 35 Years)
A matchbook with the logo of the Frobnia National Railway (Frobniz Bourashni Rallni)
A map of the border between Frobnia and Litzenburg
Notes
The game's working title was Spy.
Around the time of Border Zone'''s release, Infocom stopped assigning difficulty ratings to its games. Players generally consider Border Zone to correspond to either Infocom's "Standard" or "Advanced" level of difficulty.Border Zone was the only game Infocom ever published in the "Espionage" genre.
Infocom's experiment with real-time interactive fiction was not entirely successful. Many players enjoyed what had previously been a hallmark of Infocom's games: the total irrelevance of "real-world" time. Formerly, if a player had to leave the computer to eat, go to school, run an errand, etc., the game would still be in the same state as before. Border Zone removed that certainty. Additionally, this was the first Infocom game in which a speedy typist could theoretically be more successful than a slower one.
ReceptionComputer Gaming Worlds Scorpia found Border Zones division into three standalone adventures unsatisfying, and stated that it would have been better than one. They concluded that it was "one of Infocom's weakest games to date". PC Magazine stated that the game "has hit upon exactly the right scenario for an interactive novel" and praised the feelies' "rich detail".Compute!'' also praised the feelies, and stated that the real-time game play and playing three different characters distinguished the game from other text adventures.

Lee Manor (also Leygh, 14th century; Lee, 16th century) is a manor house in the parish of Brading on the Isle of Wight.
History
The manor lies just to the west of Sandown and as of 1912 was held with Landguard Manor by Mr. Arthur Atherley. It is first mentioned in 1332 and then belonged to John de Glamorgan.
In 1580 it seems to have been divided up between John Worsley, John Knight and John Colman. It may have had its origin in the 'Alalei' of Domesday, held before and after the Conquest by Ulnod the thegn. Richard Knight in 1712 charged Lee Farm within their manor of Landguard with a charity.

Rau'shee Warren (; born February 13, 1987) is an American professional boxer who held the WBA (Undisputed), and IBO bantamweight titles from 2016 to 2017. As an amateur they won a gold medal at the 2007 World Championships, as well as bronze at the 2005 and 2011 World Championships, all in the flyweight division.
Amateur career
At the 1st AIBA American 2004 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in 2004, at the age of 17, they upset Rayonta Whitfield and Diego Hurtado and international competitors Raúl Castañeda (Mexico), and Miguel Miranda (Venezuela) to qualify as the U.S. boxing team's 106-pound light flyweight representative at the 2004 Athens Olympics. They were both the youngest boxer in the games and the youngest US male in all sports. They were eliminated by the favored Zou Shiming of China in the first round.
They moved up to flyweight soon after and in 2005 and 2006 became US champion. At the 2005 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Mianyang they avenged a previous loss to European champion Georgy Balakshin before losing to the Korean surprise winner Lee Ok-Sung and having to settle for bronze.
In 2006 Light middleweight Akima Stocks and Warren were named USA Boxing's 2006 Athletes of the Year. That year they also moved up to fight as a bantamweight, and lost to highly regarded Cuban Guillermo Rigondeaux in November.
In 2007 they returned to the flyweight ranks and repeated as US champion.
At the 2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Chicago they defeated European Champion Georgy Balakshin in a rematch and Samir Mammadov to reach the finals. In the finals they defeated Thai Somjit Jongjohor.
In 2008 they became the first American boxer in more than 30 years to compete at two Olympic Games, accomplishing something not done since Davey Lee Armstrong in 1972 and 1976.
At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Warren lost in the first round, again to Lee Ok-Sung, in a controversial decision given that they assumed that they had won on points.
They remained in the amateur ranks and ascended to the bantamweight division again at the US Nationals 2009 where they controversially lost their semifinal 19:19 (countback loss) to eventual champion Jesus Magdaleno.
While competing for the Los Angeles Matadors in the World Series of Boxing, Warren secured a Bronze in the US nationals in 2009, gold in 2010, and in 2011 a bronze at the Worlds. A gold medal in the 2011 individual competition (they also compete for team titles) at the WSB secured champions in 5 WSB weight classes the first Olympic slots, so participation in WSB saw Warren's first near miss at qualifying (only top 2 ranked boxers after team competition selected for individual title fight). Warren won the 2011 US Olympic Trials and came home with the Bronze after the 2011 AIBA World Championships, securing their place in a 3rd Olympics, unprecedented for an American boxer, at only 25 years old.
On August 3, 2012 at the London Olympics, Rau'shee Warren failed to get past the first round of the brackets yet again for the third time of their amateur career losing to Nordine Oubaali of France in a close decision of 19-18.
World Series of Boxing record
Professional career
Warren made their long-awaited professional debut on November 9, 2012, winning a four-round unanimous decision over Luis Rivera.
Having won thirteen of their first fourteen fights (the only blemish being a three-round no contest against Javier Gallo on December 12, 2014), Warren attempted to win their first world championship—the WBA (Undisputed) and vacant IBO bantamweight titles—on August 2, 2015, but lost a debatable split decision to Juan Carlos Payano.
In a rematch with Payano on June 18, 2016, Warren gained revenge by winning both titles with a majority decision.
However, Warren lost in their first defense to Zhanat Zhakiyanov by split decision.
On 29 July 2017, Warren faced McJoye Arroyo in an IBF super flyweight eliminator. Warren outworked Arroyo in most of the rounds, often being the busier, sharper and tougher fighter. The scorecards read 118-110, 117-109 and 117-109 if favor of Warren.
In their next fight against Juan Gabriel Medina, Warren had another dominant performance and defeated their opponent via unanimous decision, winning every single round on all of the scorecards.
On September 5, 2018, it was announced that Warren would face former Olympics opponent Nordine Oubaali for the WBC bantamweight title, previously vacated by Luis Nery. Both fighters fought well, but it was Oubaali who was the bigger puncher and landed more eye-catching shots. In addition to that, Oubaali was simply busier and sharper than Warren, which ultimately made the difference. The scorecards read 117-111, 116-112 and 115-113 in favor of Oubaali.
On 15 February, Warren faced Gilberto Mendoza. Warren outclassed Mendoza and won the fight comfortably on all three scorecards, 100-90, 99-91 and 99-91.

It is directed by Michael Cumming and produced by King Bert Productions.
Overview
Series 1
Emily Verma, who fled Sandylands for a more exciting life in London, reluctantly returns for the funeral of their estranged father Limesh Verma (Bhaskar).  They are an amusement arcade owner who calls themselves Les Vegas and disappeared at sea in a pedalo. They reunite with childhood friends Tina Taylor (Webb), a tour guide, and Kenny (Jeetooa), their father's employee, as well as childhood crush Nathan Wild (Bird), a police officer.  They are forced to lodge with overbearing bed and breakfast owners Derek (Walliams) and Jeannie Swallows (Thompson) after being unable to gain entry to their father's house. Emily soon discovers that their father is alive and had faked their death because they were in debt and hoped to claim on their life insurance. Emily unwittingly becomes their partner in crime as they attempt to conceal the truth from Nathan and their colleague Trudy Wright (James), the other residents, and from a sinister insurance investigator (Bonneville), who is investigating their father's claim.
Series 2
Emily's estranged mother Donna Vegas (Oberman), a cruise ship singer, returns and begins to reconnect with their daughter and husband. Emily also begins to grow closer to Nathan and struggles to balance their relationship with their attempts to keep their father's insurance scam secret.

Reception

Alex Fletcher of BT praised the cast and described the series as "a deliciously bonkers escape to seaside nostalgia".

Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides object storage through a web service interface. Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its e-commerce network. Amazon S3 can store any type of object, which allows uses like storage for Internet applications, backups, disaster recovery, data archives, data lakes for analytics, and hybrid cloud storage.
AWS launched Amazon S3 in the United States on March 14, 2006, then in Europe in November 2007.
Design
Amazon S3 manages data with an object storage architecture which aims to provide scalability, high availability, and low latency with high durability.
The basic storage units of Amazon S3 are objects which are organized into buckets. Each object is identified by a unique, user-assigned key. Buckets can be managed using the console provided by Amazon S3, programmatically with the AWS SDK, or the REST application programming interface. Objects can be up to five terabytes in size.
Requests are authorized using an access control list associated with each object bucket and support versioning which is disabled by default. Since buckets are typically the size of an entire file system mount in other systems, this access control scheme is very coarse-grained. In other words, unique access controls cannot be associated with individual files.
Amazon S3 can be used to replace static web-hosting infrastructure with HTTP client-accessible objects. The Amazon AWS authentication mechanism allows the creation of authenticated URLs, valid for a specified amount of time.
Every item in a bucket can also be served as a BitTorrent feed. The Amazon S3 store can act as a seed host for a torrent and any BitTorrent client can retrieve the file. This can drastically reduce the bandwidth cost for the download of popular objects. A bucket can be configured to save HTTP log information to a sibling bucket; this can be used in data mining operations.
There are various User Mode File System (FUSE)–based file systems for Unix-like operating systems (for example, Linux) that can be used to mount an S3 bucket as a file system. The semantics of the Amazon S3 file system are not that of a POSIX file system, so the file system may not behave entirely as expected.
Amazon S3 provides the option to host static HTML websites with index document support and error document support.
Amazon S3 storage classes
Amazon S3 offers eight different storage classes with different levels of durability, availability, and performance requirements.
Amazon S3 Standard is the default. It is general purpose storage for frequently accessed data.
Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) is designed for less frequently accessed data, such as backups and disaster recovery data.
Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA) performs like the Standard-IA, but stores data only in one availability zone.
Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering moves objects automatically to a more cost-efficient storage class.
Amazon S3 on Outposts brings storage to installations not hosted by Amazon.
Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is a low-cost storage for rarely accessed data, but which still requires rapid retrieval.
Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval is also a low-cost option for long-lived data; it offers 3 retrieval speeds, ranging from minutes to hours.
Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive is another low-cost option.
The Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes above are distinct from Amazon Glacier, which is a separate product with its own APIs.
File size limits
An object in S3 can be between 1 byte and 5TB. If an object is larger than 5TB, it must be divided into chunks prior to uploading.
When uploading, Amazon S3 allows a maximum of 5GB in a single upload operation; hence, objects larger than 5GB must be uploaded via the S3 multipart upload API.
Notable users
Photo hosting service SmugMug has used Amazon S3 since April 2006. They experienced a number of initial outages and slowdowns, but after one year they described it as being "considerably more reliable than our own internal storage" and claimed to have saved almost $1 million in storage costs.
Netflix uses Amazon S3 as their system of record. Netflix implemented a tool, S3mper, to address the Amazon S3 limitations of eventual consistency. S3mper stores the filesystem metadata: filenames, directory structure, and permissions in Amazon DynamoDB.
Reddit is hosted on Amazon S3.
Bitcasa, and Tahoe-LAFS-on-S3, among others, use Amazon S3 for online backup and synchronization services. In 2016, Dropbox stopped using Amazon S3 services and developed its own cloud server.
Tumblr, Formspring, and Pinterest host images on Amazon S3.
Swiftype's CEO has mentioned that the company uses Amazon S3.
S3 API and competing services
The broad adoption of Amazon S3 and related tooling has given rise to competing services based on the S3 API. These services use the standard programming interface but are differentiated by their underlying technologies and business models. A standard interface enables better competition from rival providers and allows economies of scale in implementation, among other benefits.
History
Amazon Web Services introduced Amazon S3 in 2006. Amazon reported it stored more than 100 trillion objects , up from 10 billion objects in October 2007, 14 billion objects in January 2008, 29 billion objects in October 2008, 52 billion objects in March 2009, 64 billion objects in August 2009, 102 billion objects in March 2010, and 2 trillion objects in April 2013. In November 2017 AWS added default encryption capabilities at bucket level.

The Free-minded Union (; FVg) or Radical Union was a liberal party in the German Empire that existed from 1893 to 1910.
Emergence
Inside its predecessor, the German Free-minded Party, there had always been tensions between the leftist and the moderate wing. Another contentious point was the personalist style of leader Eugen Richter. When Chancellor Leo von Caprivi presented an army bill in parliament on 6 May 1893, seven Free-minded representatives, among them Georg von Siemens, decided to accept the motion. Consequently, Richter urged successfully the expulsion of the deviants. Other moderate party members, including Ludwig Bamberger and Theodor Barth, left voluntarily and formed the Free-minded Union. The left liberal wing of the Free-mindeds, loyal to Richter, assembled in the Free-minded People's Party
The new party focused on political and economically liberal positions. In the federal election of 1893, it won 13 seats. The union was initially a more loose electoral alliance than a real party. Its organisational structure was very weak. Its stronghold were in northern and eastern Germany. Together with the governing National Liberal Party and unlike the German Free-minded Party, the Free-minded Union supported the Imperial Navy arms race and the German colonial policy.
Merger with the National-Social Association
In 1903, the electoral unsuccessful social liberal and progressive Christian National-Social Association, led by the parson Friedrich Naumann, merged into the Free-minded Union. This brought new members, including Hellmut von Gerlach, to the party. Both the organisational structure and the programmatical outlook changed from this incident on. Influenced by the ideas of Joseph Chamberlain, the party tended now to compassion towards the masses of the working class, but also tried to strengthen the German national position outwards by closing the ranks of the middle and working classes. This was compatible with the union's liberal nationalist line. The gain of the National Socials' local structures led to a development of a loose notables' association towards a members' party. However, the party could not really win the support of the working class and did not become a major party.
Merger into the Progressive People's Party
From 1905 onward, the Free-minded Union cooperated increasingly with the other left liberals, namely the Free-minded People's Party and the German People's Party. In 1907, the three parties drafted a common electoral program for the elections to the Reichstag. Afterwards, they formed a common parliamentary group, which was part of the pro-government imperialist Bernhard von Bülow bloc together with the Conservatives and National Liberals. The party's own left-wing and pacifist faction, including Theodor Barth, Hellmut von Gerlach, Rudolf Breitscheid and feminist Helene Lange, were discontent with this step and left to form the Democratic Union.
In 1910, the Free-minded Union, Free-minded People's Party and German People's Party merged into the Progressive People's Party.

Gertrude Breslau Hunt (1869-1952) was an American author and lecturer from Chicago. One of the leading writers for the Socialist Party of America, they often wrote about women's issues, and was active in the suffrage movement. They also published under the name Gertrude Breslau Fuller.
Early life
Gertrude Breslau was born in Chicago on December 10, 1869. Them father, a war artist named James Cushman Breslau, died when they were an infant, and they were adopted by Henry H. Kaiser and Diadma (Best) Kaiser of Howard County, Iowa. They became a socialist at the age of 16 after studying the single tax question and the temperance movement in Iowa.
Career
By 1902, they were writing for socialist periodicals and had earned a reputation as "one of the ablest women in the Socialist movement of Illinois." By 1907 they were a national organizer for the Socialist party. They were often described by their contemporaries as a brilliant lecturer, and was involved in the Lyceum movement.
They published An Easy Wheel and Other Stories, a work of journalistic fiction depicting working-class and rural life, in 1910. Soon afterwards they moved to Pittsburgh, where they lived the rest of their life. In 1911, they were instrumental in obtaining the release of Fred Merrick, editor of Justice magazine, who had been jailed for libel after exposing brutal treatment of prisoners in the Western Penitentiary in Pennsylvania. The following year, they were a delegate from Pennsylvania to the 1912 Convention of the Socialist Party of America.
In 1915, addressing the crowd at a suffrage rally in Pittsburgh, they argued for women's suffrage as a means of achieving equal pay:
So long as women have no voice in government, so long will they be underpaid ... Why should the woman who earns a living for themselves and their family be differentiated from the male wage earner? They pay the same rent, they pay the same price for food, for fuel, for clothing. Why should they not be allowed the privilege accorded to men to have a voice in legislative affairs that they can better them condition?
They later joined the Democratic party and became the state Democratic vice-chairperson. In their obituary they are remembered as a "pioneer leader in the Democratic Party in Pittsburgh and the State." They were a assistant director of the State Museum of Pennsylvania during Governor George H. Earle's administration in the late 1930s. In 1940, they were living in Pittsburgh and still giving political speeches.
Personal life
Breslau married several times: to a Mr. Davies in 1900, to Mr. Hunt in 1901, to Mr. Paul Deininger—a former Roman Catholic priest—in 1910, and sometime later to a Mr. Fuller. They died of a stroke in the Leech Farm Hospital in Pittsburgh on November 20, 1952.

Manava (c. 750 BC – 690 BC) is an author of the Hindu geometric text of Sulba Sutras.
The Manava Sulbasutra is not the oldest (the one by Baudhayana is older), nor is it one of the most important, there being at least three Sulbasutras which are considered more important. Historians place their lifetime at around 750 BC.
Manava would not have been a mathematician in the sense that we would understand it today. Nor was they a scribe who simply copied manuscripts like Ahmes. They would certainly have been a man of very considerable learning but probably not interested in mathematics for its own sake, merely interested in using it for religious purposes. Undoubtedly they wrote the Sulbasutra to provide rules for religious rites and it would appear almost a certainty that Manava themselves would be a Hindu priest.
The mathematics given in the Sulbasutras is there to enable accurate construction of altars needed for sacrifices. It is clear from the writing that Manava, as well as being a priest, must have been a skilled craftsman.
Manava's Sulbasutra, like all the Sulbasutras, contained approximate constructions of circles from rectangles, and squares from circles, which can be thought of as giving approximate values of π. There appear therefore different values of π throughout the Sulbasutra, essentially every construction involving circles leads to a different such approximation. The paper of R.C. Gupta is concerned with an interpretation of verses 11.14 and 11.15 of Manava's work which give π = 25/8 = 3.125.

Arno's Court Triumphal Arch () is an 18th-century monument in Junction Road, Brislington, Bristol, England.
Description
The arch was built around 1760 by James Bridges, for William Reeve, a prominent local Quaker and business person. It is built from Bath stone, of classical proportions but with Gothic and Moorish detail.
In its current position, next to the main A4 road, it marked the entrance to the (since demolished) Arno's Court Bath House. A plaque on the arch states that it was moved from its original position, at the entrance to the Black Castle, in 1912 and was fully renovated in 1995.
The arch was designated as Grade II* listed in 1959.
Carvings
The niches on each side of the arch once contained carvings from the demolished City Gates. The rear elevation is much simpler than the front, and includes a carving of the City's coat of arms.
The four statues which decorate the archway are 20th-century copies of 13th- and 14th-century originals. The original statues of King Edward I and King Edward III were set in one of the deep niches on the western side that have tent-like canopies. The original statues were taken from Bristol's Lawfords' Gate that was demolished around the time of construction of the arch. Those on the east-side are 13th-century figures from Bristol's Newgate representing Robert, the builder of Bristol Castle, and Geoffrey de Montbray, bishop of Coutances, builder of the fortified walls of Bristol. The originals of all four were removed due to their deteriorating condition in 1898 and they are now in the St Nicholas's Church Museum.

A touch user interface (TUI) is a computer-pointing technology based upon the sense of touch (haptics). Whereas a graphical user interface (GUI) relies upon the sense of sight, a TUI enables not only the sense of touch to innervate and activate computer-based functions, it also allows the user, particularly those with visual impairments, an added level of interaction based upon tactile or Braille input.
Technology
Generally, the TUI requires pressure or presence with a switch located outside of the printed paper. Not to be confused with electronic paper endeavors, the TUI requires the printed pages to act as a template or overlay to a switch array. By interacting with the switch through touch or presence, an action is innervated. The switching sensor cross-references with a database. The database retains the correct pathway to retrieve the associated digital content or launch the appropriate application.
TUI icons may be used to indicate to the reader of the printed page what action will occur upon interacting with a particular position on the printed page.
Turning pages and interacting with new pages that may have the same touch points as previous or subsequent pages, a z-axis may be used to indicate the plane of activity. Z-axis can be offset around the boundary of the page. When the unique z-axis is interacted with, x,y-axis can have identical touch points as other pages. For example, 1,1,1 indicates a z-axis of 1 (page 1) and the x,y-axis is 1,1. However, turning the page and pressing a new z-axis, say page 2, and then the same x,y-axis content position as page 1, gains the following coordinate structure: 2,1,1.
An integrated circuit (IC) is located either within the printed material or within an enclosure that cradles the printed material. This IC receives a signal when a switch is innervated. The firmware located within the IC communicates via Universal Serial Bus (USB) either connected to a cable, or using a wireless protocol adapter to a reference database that can reside on media within a computer or appliance. Upon receipt of the coordinate structure from the firmware, the database correlates the position with a pre-determined link or pathway to digital content or execution command for an application. After correlating the link with the pathway, a signal is sent to retrieve and render the terminal of the path.
Educational mandate
In the United States, legislation took effect in December 2006, that requires educational publishers in the K-12 education industry to provide a National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard (NIMAS). In essence, educational publishers must provide an inclusive experience to those students who are blind. If they are unable to provide this experience, they are required to provide the digital content source files to a clearing house that will convert the materials into an accessible experience for the student. The TUI has the promise of enabling the publishers to maintain control of their content while providing an inclusive, tactile, or Braille experience to students who are visually impaired. Further, using a Braille approach may serve to help enhance Braille literacy while meeting the mandates of NIMAS.

South Carolina Highway 252 (SC 252) is a state highway in the U.S. state of South Carolina. The highway connects the Anderson and Laurens areas with Honea Path and Ware Shoals. It has a unique feature in that it intersects U.S. Route 76 (US 76) three times along its length.
Route description
SC 252 begins at a partial interchange with US 76/US 178 (Belton Highway) southeast of Anderson, and south of Meadow Brook, within Anderson County. It travels to the east-southeast and crosses Neals Creek before an intersection with SC 413. The highway begins curving to the southeast and crosses over Hencoop Creek before entering Craytonville. There, it intersects SC 20 Connector (SC 20 Conn.; Clinkscales Road), which connects SC 252 with SC 20 (Trail Road), since they do not intersect. A short distance later, SC 252 travels under a bridge that carries SC 20. On the southeast side of Craytonville, it has another intersection with SC 252 Conn. The highway traveled to the east and crosses Barkers Creek. Then, the highway starts traveling to the east-northeast and crosses Blue Barker Creek, just before entering Honea Path.
Through town, it travels just south of Honea Path Middle School before it has a second intersection with US 76/US 178 (North Main Street). The three highway travel concurrently to the east. One block later, US 178 splits off to the right, onto Church Street. US 76/SC 252 continue to the east. They split northwest of Honea Path Elementary School. Just after leaving town, SC 252 enters Abbeville County and travels through Broadmouth. It intersects the eastern terminus of SC 184 just before entering Ware Shoals. Between Summit Drive and Edgewood Drive, the highway enters Greenwood County. At East Fleming Street, SC 252 turns left, while SC 252 Truck continues along North Greenwood Avenue. About one block later, it intersects US 25 Business (US 25 Bus.), onto which SC 252 turns left. The two highways travel concurrently to the north-northwest. Just before leaving town, they curve to the northeast. They cross over the Saluda River on the Senator William H. "Billy" O'Dell Bridge, which marks the Laurens County line. They curve to a due north direction and curve to the east-northeast and meet US 25 at an interchange. Here, US 25 Bus. ends, while SC 252 continues to the east-northeast. It curves to the northeast and crosses Walnut Creek. The highway travels through Poplar Springs. Then, it crosses over the Reedy River and Rabon Creek. A short distance later, it meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with US 76 (West Main Street).

Mobile defense is a manoeuvre by military units that repulses an attack by the use of wellplanned counter-attacks by the defender, which seeks to avoid a pitched battle.
One modern example of mobile defense was during World War II during the Third Battle of Kharkov. The German commander, Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, used II SS Panzer Corps to launch an attack to the rear of the Soviet spearhead force and to encircle it. The success led to the stabilization of the German Army Group South. Manstein became a proponent of the use of a strategy of mobile defense on the Eastern Front as a whole. Manstein came to the conclusion that Germany could not defeat the Soviet Union in the traditional static defensive system used in World War I and that the only chance to achieve a draw was to wear down the Soviet Army in costly mobile battles.
Manstein formulated a plan for the summer of 1943 in which they argued all mechanized forces should be deployed south of Kharkov and await the Soviet summer offensive, which was believed to be aimed at capturing the Donets Basin. The mechanized force would launch an offensive south to the Sea of Azov once the Basin had been captured by the Soviets. The German Führer, Adolf Hitler, ultimately rejected this plan, instead choosing a more conventional, double-envelopment attack on Kursk.
The Battle of St. Vith, one of the many battles fought during the Battle of the Bulge, was notable for its use of armor in a mobile defense. General Bruce Clarke organized their Combat command to prevent the German attackers from advancing more than 1 km a day. The delaying action was decisive in preventing German forces quickly advancing through the area and was one of the reasons for the German offensive's failure.

Richard Whittle was born in Preston, Lancashire, in the fourth quarter of 1864 and they were a footballer who played in The Football League for Preston North End.
Richard Whittle signed for Fishwick Ramblers, a Preston–based club who did appear in the FA Cup in the mid–1880s. In 1884 they moved to another Preston–based club called Preston Swifts. There appears to be no data on this club at all. In 1885 Whittle returned to Fishwick Ramblers but was gone in 1886. In 1886 Whittle joined Haydock. Haydock joined the Lancashire League 12 years after Whittle had joined. In 1888 Whittle joined Preston North End. Whittle was described as a strong–tackling defender.
Richard Whittle, playing as a full–back, made their Preston North End and League debut on 6 October 1888 at Deepdale, the home of Preston North End. The visitors were Stoke and the home team won 7–0. Whittle scored their debut and only League goal in this match. Whittle made the score 6–0 with a powerful 30-yard shot. Richard Whittle appeared in one of the 22 League matches played by Preston North End in season 1888–89 and scored one League goal. Whittle, as a full–back (one appearance), played in a Preston North End defence that achieved a clean–sheet once. Preston North End won the League Championship but, as Whittle only played the once one can only speculate whether they were granted a Championship winners medal.

The black-chinned robin (Poecilodryas brachyura) is a species of bird in the family Petroicidae. It is found in northern New Guinea. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests.
Described by English naturalist, Philip Sclater, in 1874, the black-chinned robin is a member of the Australasian robin family Petroicidae. Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA-DNA hybridisation studies placed this group in a Corvida parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines, including pardalotes, fairy-wrens, honeyeaters, and crows. However, subsequent molecular research (and current consensus) places the robins as a very early offshoot of the Passerida (or "advanced" songbirds) within the songbird lineage.
Measuring 14 to 15 cm (5.5–6 in), the black-chinned robin has a dark brown to black head and upperparts, with a prominent white stripe or "eyebrow" above the eye. The chin is black immediately under the bill. Its tail is markedly shorter than other Australasian robins. The throat and underparts are white, and there is a white bar on the otherwise dark-plumaged wing. The bill is black, the eyes are dark brown, and the legs pale brown or pink. Its song is a descending series of notes, which resembles that of the fan-tailed cuckoo.
The black-chinned robin is found predominantly in the lowland forests of northwestern and central New Guinea (mainly in West Papua and only a little in Papua New Guinea's northwest) from sea level to 650 m (2000 ft). Within the rainforest it is found in pairs in the understory or on the ground. It is insectivorous, and hunts by gleaning. It is a weak flyer.

During the first two years, Allsvenskan consisted of three groups with ten teams in each, i.e. a total of 30 teams. The groups were divided geographically, in Allsvenskan Norra (North), Allsvenskan Mellersta (Mid) and Allsvenskan Södra (South).
For the third season, 2009–10, Allsvenskan was restructured into two groups, Norra and Södra, with 12 teams each, so there were only 24 teams left in total. This structure has so far (2014) been kept since then.

The tanager finch (Oreothraupis arremonops) is a songbird species. In spite of its common name, it is neither a tanager nor a finch, but a New World sparrow, having been moved to that family after variously being placed in either the Emberizidae or the true tanager family Thraupidae. It is the only species in the monotypic genus Oreothraupis.
It is found in Colombia and Ecuador, where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.

Foss v Harbottle (1843) 2 Hare 461, 67 ER 189 is a leading English precedent in corporate law. In any action in which a wrong is alleged to have been done to a company, the proper claimant is the company itself. This is known as "the proper plaintiff rule", and the several important exceptions that have been developed are often described as "exceptions to the rule in Foss v Harbottle". Amongst This is the "derivative action", which allows a minority shareholder to bring a claim on behalf of the company. This applies in situations of "wrongdoer control" and is, in reality, the only true exception to the rule. The rule in Foss v Harbottle is best seen as the starting point for minority shareholder remedies.
The rule has now largely been partly codified and displaced in the United Kingdom by the Companies Act 2006 sections 260–263, setting out a statutory derivative claim.
Facts
Richard Foss and Edward Starkie Turton were two minority shareholders in the "Victoria Park Company". The company had been set up in September 1835 to buy of land near Manchester and, according to the report,
enclosing and planting the same in an ornamental and park-like manner, and erecting houses thereon with attached gardens and pleasure-grounds, and selling, letting or otherwise disposing thereof.
This became Victoria Park, Manchester. Subsequently, an Act of Parliament incorporated the company. The claimants alleged that property of the company had been misapplied and wasted and various mortgages were given improperly over the company's property. They asked that the guilty parties be held accountable to the company and that a receiver be appointed.
The defendants were the five company directors (Thomas Harbottle, Joseph Adshead, Henry Byrom, John Westhead, Richard Bealey) and the solicitors and architect (Joseph Denison, Thomas Bunting and Richard Lane); and also H. Rotton, E. Lloyd, T. Peet, J. Biggs and S. Brooks, the several assignees of Byrom, Adshead and Westhead, who had become bankrupts.
Judgment
Wigram VC dismissed the claim and held that when a company is wronged by its directors it is only the company that has standing to sue. In effect the court established two rules. Firstly, the "proper plaintiff rule" is that a wrong done to the company may be vindicated by the company alone. Secondly, the "majority rule principle" states that if the alleged wrong can be confirmed or ratified by a simple majority of members in a general meeting, then the court will not interfere (legal term).
Developments
The rule was later extended to cover cases where what is complained of is some internal irregularity in the operation of the company. However, the internal irregularity must be capable of being confirmed/sanctioned by the majority.
The rule in Foss v Harbottle has another important implication. A shareholder cannot generally bring a claim to recover any reflective loss – a diminution in the value of their or their shares in circumstances where the diminution arises because the company has suffered an actionable loss. The proper course is for the company to bring the action and recoup the loss with the consequence that the value of the shares will be restored.
Because Foss v Harbottle leaves the minority in an unprotected position, exceptions have arisen and statutory provisions have come into being which provide some protection for the minority. By far and away the most important protection is the unfair prejudice action in ss. 994-6 of the Companies Act 2006 (UK) (s 232 Corporations Act 2001 in Australia). Also, there is a new statutory derivate action available under ss 260–269 of the 2006 Act (and s 236 Corporations Act 2001 in Australia).
Exceptions to the rule
There are certain exceptions to the rule in Foss v. Harbottle, where litigation will be allowed. The following exceptions protect basic minority rights, which are necessary to protect regardless of the majority's vote.
1. Ultra vires and illegality
The directors or controlling shareholders of a company may not use their control of the company to commit acts which would be ultra vires or illegal.
s 39 Companies Act 2006 for the rules on corporate capacity
Smith v Croft (No 2) and Cockburn v. Newbridge Sanitary Steam Laundry Co. [1915] 1 IR 237, 252–59 (per O'Brien LC and Holmes LJ) for the illegality point
2. Actions requiring a special majority
If some special voting procedure would be necessary under the company's constitution or under the Companies Act, it would defeat both if that could be sidestepped by ordinary resolutions of a simple majority, and no redress for aggrieved minorities to be allowed.

3. Invasion of individual rights

Since New Mexico's admission to the Union in January 1912, it has participated in 28 United States presidential elections. In the 1912 presidential election, Theodore Roosevelt, the Progressive Party's nominee, received the highest vote share (17.1%) ever won by a third party candidate in New Mexico. In the 1932 presidential election, Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt won New Mexico, defeating Republican Herbert Hoover by 26.96%, which remains the largest ever margin of victory in the state's history. In the 2000 presidential election, Democrat Al Gore won New Mexico, defeating Republican George W. Bush by a margin of just 0.06% (366 votes).
Up to the 2016 presidential election, New Mexico has been a leading indicator of election trends with a success rate of 88.9%; the winner in New Mexico has won the presidency 25 out of 28 times, except in the 1976, 2000, and 2016 presidential elections. The winner of the nationwide popular vote has carried New Mexico in all presidential elections except in 1976, when the incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford won it, defeating Democrat Jimmy Carter.

There are 53 municipalities of Finland in which Finnish is not the sole official language. In Finland, as of December 31, 2013, 89.3% of the population speak Finnish, 5.3% Swedish and 0.04% Sami languages. Both Finnish and Swedish are official languages of Finland. Officially, a municipality is bilingual if the minority language group consists of at least 8% of the population, or at least 3,000 speakers. A previously bilingual municipality remains so if the linguistic minority proportion drops below 8%, up to 6%. If it drops below 6%, it is possible for the municipality to remain bilingual by government decree, on the recommendation of the municipal council, for a further ten years. Municipalities that make use of the 3,000-speaker rule include the national capital Helsinki and the cultural center of Swedish Finns, Turku. On the Åland archipelago, where Finnish is almost absent from daily life, the language law does not apply. On the mainland, the highest proportion of Swedish-speakers is found on the western coast, in Ostrobothnia.
Of the 310 Finnish municipalities, 16 are monolingually Swedish. 33 municipalities are bilingually Finnish and Swedish; of these, 15 have a Swedish-speaking majority and 18 a Finnish-speaking one. Four municipalities, all located in Lapland, have a Finnish-speaking majority and a Sami-speaking minority: Enontekiö, Inari, Sodankylä and Utsjoki. Initially, only Swedish was accorded official bilingualism, through a language act of 1922; similar provisions were extended to Sami through a 1991 law. The 1922 law was replaced by new but largely similar legislation in 2003.

A sitara or sitarah ( ) is an ornamental curtain used in the sacred sites of Islam. A sitara forms part of the kiswah: the cloth covering of the Kaaba in Mecca. Another sitara adorns the Prophet's Tomb in the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi mosque in Medina. These textiles bear embroidered inscriptions of verses from the Quran and other significant texts. Sitaras have been created annually since the 16th century as part of a set of textiles sent to Mecca. The tradition is that the textiles are provided by the ruler responsible for the holy sites. In different eras, this has meant the Mamluk Sultans, the Sultans of the Ottoman Empire, and presently the rulers of Saudi Arabia. The construction of the sitaras is both an act of religious devotion and a demonstration of the wealth of the rulers who commission them.
Textiles of the Islamic holy sites
The earliest recorded sitara was made in Egypt in 1544, during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent. Suleiman set aside the revenue of ten villages to fund the creation of textiles for the Kaaba and the Prophet's Mosque: an arrangement that continued until 1813. Replacing the textiles is one of the privileges of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, a title adopted by Mamluk, Ottoman, and Saudi Arabian rulers.
Sitaras for the Kaaba were part of a set of textiles made annually at a dedicated workshop in Cairo, the Dar al-Kiswa, until 1927 when the king Ibn Saud established a workshop in Mecca. At the start of the 20th century, the Cairo workshop employed more than a hundred artists and textile workers. Responsibility for transporting the textiles from Cairo to Mecca was given to a specially chosen Muslim family, for whom it was a high honour. The textiles were usually cut up and distributed once replaced. Ottoman royals and dignitaries would convert the pieces to clothing or tomb coverings.
Textiles of the Great Mosque
The Kaaba, situated in the Great Mosque of Mecca, is the most holy site in Islam. It is the qibla, the point that Muslims face towards while praying. The Five Pillars of Islam include the hajj, a pilgrimage to Islam's holiest sites. One of the rites of the hajj is the tawaf which involves walking seven times around the Kaaba.
The textile coverings of the Kaaba are among the most sacred objects in Islamic art. A sitara, on average by , covers the door of the Kaaba and forms part of the kiswah: the textile covering of the building. This is assembled by sewing together four separate textile panels. This sitara is also known as the burqu'''. A smaller sitara covers an internal door of the Kaaba, the Bab al-Tawba. Being protected from weathering, this internal sitara is replaced much less frequently. The tradition is also more recent; the earliest documented internal sitara was in 1893. The Maqam Ibrahim (Station of Abraham) is a small square stone near the Kaaba which, according to Islamic tradition, bears the footprint of Abraham. It used to be housed in a structure with its own sitara that was replaced annually. The minbar (pulpit) within the Great Mosque has its own sitara.
Having been in contact with the holiest site of Islam, the textiles are regarded as infused with barakah (blessings). After use, they are usually split into parts to be given to dignitaries or pilgrims. Fragments of recent kiswahs adorn many of Saudi Arabia's government buildings and embassies.
Sitaras of the Prophet's Tomb
The tradition of the Sultan sending a sitara to cover the Prophet's Tomb began in the 10th century. A white sitara was provided for the tomb in the 12th century by the Fatimids. Being away from direct sunlight, the Medina textiles have been replaced less frequently than the Kaaba textiles; in the 15th century, this was every six or seven years as the fabric wore out.
Decoration
The basic designs of the sitara were established in the 16th century and continue to the present. The colours used have changed in different eras. The present colour scheme for the sitara of the Kaaba, in use since the early 20th century, is gold and white embroidery on a black background.
The inscriptions embroidered in gold and silver wire have become more ornate over time. These inscriptions include verses from the Quran and supplications to Allah, as well as the names of the rulers who commissioned the textiles. Sitaras made in the Ottoman Empire included the Sultan's tughra (their official calligraphed monogram) in their design. The shahada (the Islamic declaration of faith) is another text used repeatedly. Sitaras for the Kaaba were traditionally decorated with gold buttons and tassels.
Surviving examples
Although they are usually divided into parts after use, rare examples of complete sitaras exist in some collections. These collections include the Khalili Collection of hajjes and the Arts of Pilgrimage, the British Museum, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met). During the Ottoman era, many sacred textiles, including some sitaras, were returned to Istanbul after use, now forming part of the collection of the Topkapı Palace. Among the Khalili collection's sitaras is one from the Kaaba, high, dating from 1606. Made in Cairo, it was commissioned by Ahmed I. Others, similarly embroidered with multiple verses from the Quran, were commissioned by Abdülmejid I and Mahmud II. This collection also includes several sitaras for the Prophet's Mosque, from the 18th century onwards. One in red silk, high, was made in Istanbul in the early 19th century. It bears the cartouche of Mahmud II who commissioned it for the Rawḍah ash-Sharifah'' (Noble Garden) of the mosque. The Met's sitara was commissioned by Abdul Hamid II for the interior door of the Kaaba and is high. It is dated 1315 AH (1897–98 AD) and calls for blessings for Abbas II of Egypt, who would have overseen the textile's production.
An 18th century sitara, commissioned by Selim III for the Prophet's Mosque, was donated to the Ashmolean Museum by Nasser Khalili in 2012. Khalili also donated two sitaras made for the Prophet's Mosque to the British Museum in 2012. One is dated AH 1204 (1789–1790 AD) and bears the name of Selim III. The other was commissioned by Mahmud II in the early 18th century and bears their tughra. The Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilisation includes a sitara from the door of the Kaaba from 1985. The Museum of Turkish Calligraphy Art in Istanbul has a complete kiswah. In 1983 the Saudi Arabian government donated a sitara from the Kaaba to the headquarters of the United Nations, where it remains on display.

The history of the City of Perth, a local government area of Western Australia is defined over three distinct periods:
From 1829 to 1838 — controlled by the Governor of Western Australia
From 1838 to 1858 — controlled by the Perth Town Trust
From 1858 to present — controlled by the Perth City Council, later renamed City of Perth
Origins
On 15 June 1837, an Act was proclaimed to ..provide for the management of roads, streets and other internal communications within the settlement of Western Australia. The management and control was vested in a body of trustees consisting of the Justices of the Peace resident in the town; and the proprietors of allotments held in fee simple. The act was repealed in September 1842 and authority was conferred on elected representatives. The first elected Chairman and committee took office on 8 February 1842 and comprised:
Walter Boyd Andrews (Chairman)
George Leake, James Purkis, Peter Broun, W. H. Drake, Richard Jones (committee members)
James Purkis was appointed treasurer
On 23 February 1856 (two years before the dissolution of the Trust), Perth was constituted a city upon the foundation of the Bishopric of Perth through the consecration of the first Anglican Bishop of Perth, Matthew Blagden Hale.
From 1858 to 1880, the President of the Council was styled "Chairman", from 1880 until 1929, the Chairman was termed the "Mayor" and from 1929 the mayor was elevated to the title of "Lord Mayor".
Chairman, Perth Town Trust (1838–1858)
Chairman, Perth City Council (1858–1879)
Mayor, Perth City Council (1880–1929)
Lord Mayor, Perth City Council (since 1929)

Phahurat or Pahurat (), often known as Thailand's Little India, is an ethnic neighborhood surrounding Phahurat Road in Wang Burapha Phirom Subdistrict, Phra Nakhon District, Bangkok. The area that would become Phahurat was an enclave of Annamese (Vietnamese) immigrants who came to Siam during the reign of King Taksin (1768–1782). In 1898, a first broke out and paved way for a road which was named "Bahurada", commonly spelled today as Phahurat or Pahurat (as it is pronounced), by King Chulalongkorn in remembrance of their daughter Princess Bahurada Manimaya (RTGS: Phahurat Manimai) () who had died at young age.
Many of today's Phahurat residents are of South Asian descent. A Sikh community settled there more than a century ago and established a textile trading center that is still thriving. The golden-domed Siri Guru Singh Sabha temple is a landmark of Phahurat. The neighborhood is also home to South Asian Hindus and Muslims.
For the road, Phahurat is a short route that is divided into two parts. The first is the road continues from Ban Mo Road at Ban Mo Intersection ended up at the point where it meets Tri Phet Road, known as Phahurat Intersection, while the second separates itself from the left side of Chak Phet Road to the termination at Phahurat Intersection, both parts are one-way roads.
The sprawling of Chinese shops from the nearby Chinatown are slowly encroaching on Phahurat, but South Asian restaurants and businesses still dominate the area. It is home to some of Bangkok's more unusual shopping sites, including the sprawling Sampheng Market (Saphan Han), The Old Siam Plaza, and Nightingale–Olympic, with the four-storey India Emporium.

An EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station (ExPRESS) Logistics Carrier (ELC) is an unpressurized attached payload platform for the International Space Station (ISS) that provides mechanical mounting surfaces, electrical power, and command and data handling services for Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) as well as science experiments on the ISS. The ELCs were developed primarily at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, with support from JSC, KSC, and MSFC. ELC was formerly called "Express Pallet" and is the unpressurized counterpart to the pressurized ExPRESS Rack. An ELC provides scientists with a platform and infrastructure to deploy experiments in the vacuum of space without requiring a separate dedicated Earth-orbiting satellite.
ELCs interface directly with the ISS integrated truss common attach system (CAS). The P3 Truss has two such attach points called Unpressurised Cargo Carrier Attachment System (UCCAS) mechanisms, one facing zenith (space facing) called UCCAS-1, the other facing nadir (earth facing) called UCCAS-2. The S3 Truss has four similar locations called Payload Attachment System (PAS) mechanisms, two facing Zenith (PAS-1 and PAS-2), and two facing Nadir (PAS-3 and PAS-4).
Description
The ELC are four un-pressurized attached payloads, some designed by the Brazilian Space Agency, for the International Space Station (ISS) that provides mechanical mounting surfaces, electrical power, and command and data handling services for science experiments on the ISS. The ELCs have a deck size of about 14 feet by 16 feet and spans the width of the space shuttle's payload bay. They are made of steel, coated with UV paint. Each one is capable of providing scientists with a platform and infrastructure to deploy experiments in the vacuum of space without requiring a separate dedicated Earth-orbiting satellite. Each carrier is capable of carrying 9,800 lbs. to orbit and will also serve as parking fixtures for spare ISS hardware (ORUs) which can be retrieved when needed. Experiments are mounted on ExPRESS payload adapters (ExPA) which are about the same size as the FRAMs that hold ORUs.
Electrical subsystem ExPRESS carrier avionics (ExPCA)
Within the electrical subsystem of the ELC, the ExPRESS carrier avionics (ExPCA) provides electrical power distribution to experiments, and data interfaces to the ISS. Within the ExPCA, the ColdFire-based flight computer, software, and related electronics comprise its "flight controller unit" (FCU). The FCU runs the free open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) RTEMS and provides the computing and communication resources as an ELC Command and Data Handling (C&DH) system with the following major goals:
Provide a low-rate data link (LRDL) interface to ISS to accept commands for the ELC and the resident experiments. The ExPCA is implemented as a remote terminal (RT) on the MIL-STD-1553 "ISS local bus." This interface also returns housekeeping telemetry from the ExPCA and resident experiments to the ISS.
Provide an LRDL from the ExPCA to the experiments resident on the ELC to forward commands from the ISS to the experiments and to receive telemetry from the experiments for transmission to the ISS. This is another MIL-STD-1553 interface, with the ExPCA acting as the Bus Controller (BC).
Provide a high-rate data link (HRDL) between the ELC and the ISS. This interface is implemented as a fiber optical data bus with a capacity of up to 95.0 Megabits per second (Mbit/s). The primary function of this interface is the return on high-volume experiment Science data from the resident experiments to the ISS.
Provide an Ethernet Local Area Network (LAN) between the ELC and the resident experiments up to 6.0 Mbit/s per experiment. The primary function of this interface is the return of science experiment data from to the ISS, relayed through the HRDL.
Support six analog input channels at each ExPA (ExPRESS payload adapter) location.
Support six discrete command channels at each ExPA location.
Manifested on ELC-2 was the first ELC-based payload, Materials for ISS Experiment (MISSE-7). mounted on an ExPA.

Gaspar Jesús Melchor Flores Magón (6 January 1871 – 7 December 1930) was a Mexican politician, journalist, and jurist. The more moderate brother of Ricardo and Enrique Flores Magón, they served in the cabinet of Francisco I. Madero.
Biography
Jesús Flores Magón was born in San Jerónimo Tecóatl in the state of Oaxaca in 1871,
to Margarita Magón and Teodoro Flores, a Nahua who had fought in Benito Juárez's Liberal Army.
At an early age the family relocated to Mexico City.
They graduated in law in 1897 and, in conjunction with their brother Ricardo, founded the newspaper Regeneración, the first edition of which appeared on 7 August 1900. As editor of the paper, they were jailed on several occasions for criticising the judicial system. They were later expelled from the country for their anti-Porfirio Díaz writings; they fled to the United States where their political differences with their brothers – also exiled, and now espousing anarchist beliefs – deepened.
They returned to Mexico in 1910 following the overthrow of Porfirio Díaz in the early days of the Mexican Revolution.
In 1911, alongside Antonio Irineo Villarreal, they began publishing a moderate version of the newspaper Regeneración in Mexico City, while their brothers – still in their U.S. exile – published a more radical broadsheet under the same title in Los Angeles, California.
President Francisco I. Madero appointed them under-secretary for justice in their cabinet. They also served as secretary of the interior from February to November 1912 and, subsequently, as secretary for development. Following Victoriano Huerta's coup d'état in February 1913, they again went into exile.
Upon returning, they resumed their law practice.
During the tumultuous years that followed, they remained in Mexico City. When Venustiano Carranza assumed the presidency, they chose to leave the country on account of the fact that they had been the running mate of presidential candidate Manuel Calero y Sierra; they returned to Mexico following Carranza's assassination.

The Saadé family is Antiochian Greek Orthodox Christian and originates from the Syrian coastal city of Latakia. It owns two vineyards, Château Marsyas in Lebanon and Domaine de Bargylus in Syria which kept their production ongoing despite the chronic instability facing the Middle East.
History and origins
The ancient harbor city of Latakia was known in antiquity as Laodicea in Syria or Laodicea on the Sea and it was the Seleucid king Seleucos I Nikator who named it after their mother and daughter. It was founded on the site of the canaanite village of Mazabda otherwise known as Ramitha.
The Saadé family belongs to the orthodox community of Antioch which together with the patriarchates of Constantinople, Alexandria and Jerusalem constitute one of the four seats of the Christian East.
This family of rich merchants, industrialists and major Syrian landowners had many prominent representatives among which Elias Saadé, Mikhaïl Saadé and Gabriel Saadé (1854-1939) as well as the latter sons Wadih Saadé (1883-1968), Edouard Saadé (1885-1952) and Rodolphe Saadé (1900-1958). Their cousin Angèle Ibrahim married the brother of the former prime minister of Syria Farès el-Khoury (1873-1962).  They are the grandfather of the Syrian poet and writer Colette Khoury.
According to some sources, the Saadé family notoriously treated with respect and acted fairly towards peasants working on its lands unlike many other feudal landowners. It owned extensive properties throughout the country held not only by the male but also the female members of the family which indicated their clearly progressive spirit for the time.
In 1840, Elias Saadé undertook an in-depth reform of olive tree culture and production methods in the Syrian coastal area. They married Angelina Elias, the daughter of the English consul Moussa Elias whose son Yacoub Elias was consul of the German empire. Them nephew was the traveler and writer Edouard Elias Bacha.
Their son Mikhaïl Saadé, a prominent city dignitary, welcomed to their home during their visit to Latakia in 1879 the Ottoman governor of Syria Midhat Pasha who later became the Ottoman empire's Grand Vizir and prominent reformer. It is ironic that many members of the Saadé family, among which Gabriel Saadé (1854-1939) and their sons Wadih and Edouard, were condemned to death by a military tribunal several decades later in 1914 for their alleged political activities against the empire. The death sentences will nevertheless not be carried out.
Their other son, Gabriel Saadé (1854-1939) was also a prominent landowner and trader. They married Marianna Ibrahim from the city of Antioch. One of their family enterprises Gabriel Saadé & fils is mentioned as having opened one of the first cotton ginning stations in Syria in the 1920s by attaching it to its modern olive oil mill facility.
In 1943, their grandson Wadih Saadé was elected member of the Syrian parliament. They previously held the position of vice-president of the council of the Alawite State established during the French mandate era. According to some sources, they also subscribed, along with their brother Edouard, to a fund supporting Iraqi rebels against British rule.
Their other grandson Edouard Saadé upheld their thesis in 1905 at the International institute of Agriculture of Beauvais along with their cousin Toufick Saadé. Following in the latter footsteps, Habib Saadé, Toufick's brother, acquired an agricultural property in Cyprus in 1922 in the district of Meneou in which they planted tobacco cured in the same way it is done in Latakia. Toufick's nephew, Chafic Saadé worked with one of the oldest British tobacco brokers Clagett, Brachi & Co for the sale of their yearly production. Édouard Saadé – or their son Emile – is mentioned among the administrators and shareholders of the Société des Asphaltes et Pétroles de Lattaquié, a French company based in Paris (France).
The listing of Syria's main merchants in the 1907 edition of Kelly's Directory of merchants, manufacturers and shippers, mentions four members of the Saadé family among the eight leading merchants of the city of Latakia.
Their youngest grandson Rodolphe Saadé (1900-1958) was a prominent merchant, industrialist and landowner who travelled frequently to Europe and the United States.
Sharing their vision for their country, they declared to the American geologist Raymond E.Crist (who mentions it in their book published in 1962 “Land for the fellahin: land tenure and land use in the Near-East”) during their visit to Syria: “our wealth is in agriculture and our industries should be based on it”.He will also prove their pioneering spirit in recruiting Italian engineers and propose to the then-Syrian president Husni al-Za'im the construction of a modern port in Latakia. They were a honorary consul of the Netherlands in Latakia until their death in 1958.
It is worth noting that the Saadé family also owned the “Régie des Tabacs et Tombacs” in Latakia which held the commercial monopoly of the highly-praised tobacco produced in the area.
The Saadé family was also instrumental in the creation of the mountain resort of Slenfeh in the alawite mountain who was a particularly praised destination for the Latakia and Aleppo upper-classes.
Rodolphe married Odette Nauphal, daughter of Lebanese member of parliament under the French mandate Abdallah Nauphal, scion of a family originating from the ancient Arab Christian kingdom of the Ghassanids who served for over three centuries in the Ottoman administration. The latter is the nephew of Baron Selim de Nauphal (1828-1902) who was state councilor and professor at the institute of oriental languages of the ministry of foreign affairs of Tsarist Russia. Their paternal grandfather Abdallah Bek Nauphal (1796-1879) (He was granted the title of “Bek” in 1855) took part in the government of Ibrahim Bacha, the son of Muhammad Ali of Egypt, during the latter conquest of Syria. They wrote a history of these events which was published much later under the title “ مذكرات تاريخية” (transl.”Historical notes”) attributed to unknown author. They later held the position of first advisor to the Mutassarif of Mount-Lebanon Daoud Bacha and subsequently as Qaïmmaqam of the Kura district. The latter nephew Nicolas Bek Nauphal (1817-1895) was elected member of the Ottoman parliament in Istanbul in 1876. They became famous for ridiculing the Ottoman capital during one of the parliamentary session by declaring “We come from the provinces and have been voting since the beginning of the Tanzimat. Istanbul has only started this year in taking part in the process”. Their maternal grandfather Christophe Catzeflis, scion of a family of Greek descent who allegedly descended from the Palaiologos of Constantinople, was consul of various European powers among which Austria-Hungary, Denmark and Sweden-Norway. Among other guests, they welcomed French poet and statesman Alphonse de Lamartine during their visit in the East. The beauty of their wife “Lady Jane” was praised by many travelers and diplomats among which Frederick Arthur Neale who went so as to translate in English one of the poems dedicated to them in their “Eight years in Syria, Palestine and Asia Minor from 1842 to 1850” published in 1851. Abdallah Nauphal's namesake and grandson is CEO of Insight Investments.
Johnny Saadé, the son of Rodolphe, refocused the family activities in the winemaking and tourism fields. They live with their wife in Beirut. The latter is the daughter of Louis Ziadé (1890-1968), who graduated from the Lille law faculty and was elected 7 times in a row president of the Aleppo Bar association in Syria where they lived for 25 years before returning to Lebanon to become member of the Lebanese parliament. They are, at some point, among the favorite candidates to the presidency of the Republic of Lebanon under French mandate. They resided at the Ziadé Palace in Zokak el-Blatt. They were the first cousin of the then Maronite archbishop of Beirut Ignatius Ziadé. Their paternal grandmother was the daughter of Youssef Allam, one of the leading silk traders of Mount-Lebanon in the 19th century and whose activities extended to Egypt and the Syrian hinterland. They married Mathilde Bekhyt, daughter of Georges Bekhyt, a rich cotton merchant on the Alexandria exchange in Egypt. Them uncle was the lawyer Paul Nujaym -whose father Faris Nujaym was «cited in one pre-1914 source as the Dean of Mount-Lebanon's doctors»-, also known under their pen name Paul Jouplain, who held a doctorate from the Paris faculty of law and was one of the main exponents of the idea of a Greater Lebanon. They published in 1908 “La question du Liban” which quickly became the definitive book on the subject especially during the Paris peace conference in 1919. Them first cousin, Marie Bekhyt married the Lebanese painter Georges Daoud Corm. Their son is Lebanese economist and historian Georges Corm.
Among other members of the Saadé family, special mention can be made of Gabriel W.Saadé, a prominent Syrian historian who made great contributions to our knowledge of the ancient city of Ugarit. They wrote on various cultural and historical subjects. They also founded the archeological museum of Latakia. In the 1940s, they cofounded the Orthodox Youth Movement in Lebanon and Syria which was instrumental in the cultural and educational renaissance within the Patriarchate of Antioch. They were made Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in 1989. Their niece, Leila Badre, is the famous archaeologist and director of the Museum of the American University of Beirut.
Claire Saadé, the mother of the famous Egyptian-born actor Omar Sharif, is also mentioned as a member of this prominent family.
Several members of the Saadé family were active within the Orthodox community of Latakia and made various donations to the Patriarchate of Antioch in the last two centuries. For instance, Elias Saadé rebuilt in 1845 the episcopal church of St Nicholas as rendered by a commemorative plaque. The leadership of the orthodox community of Latakia was exclusively held for the last two centuries by a member of the Saadé family. Their position was reflected in the special section allocated to the family in the various city churches.
The vineyards
The creation of both vineyards took place in 1997 when Johnny Saadé and their two sons Karim and Sandro founded Domaine de Bargylus in Syria and Château Marsyas in the Beqaa valley in Lebanon. Soil as well as climatic studies were undertaken and the first vines are planted in 2003.
The first vintages seem to be 2006 for Bargylus and 2007 for Château Marsyas.
The Saadé family has apparently put in place very strict quality protocols for both their vineyards.
Karim Saadé and Sandro Saadé have kept the production going for Bargylus despite the raging war in Syria. They are managing their estate from Beirut having been unable to visit it since the beginning of the conflict.
The Explosion which took place in Beirut on August 4th 2020 destroyed their administrative offices and heavily injured Johnny Saadé and their son Sandro.

The Medal for Meritorious Service was a medal awarded by the Republic of Rhodesia to civilians and military personnel.
History
The Medal for Meritorious Service was awarded to civilians (who were usually government workers such as INTAF) for "resource and devotion to duty or exemplary voluntary service to the community.", and awarded to military members (used only for territorial, volunteer and reserve forces) for "resource and devotion to duty."
Description
The medal was a silver circular medal that was 36mm around, with the obverse of the medal had the national coat of arms, and the reverse had the pick from the coat of arms in the centre encircled by the words "For Meritorious Service". The recipient's name would be etched on the rim, and a silver bar would be awarded for a subsequent award. The medal also had two different divisions, a civilian division that would have just a plain orange ribbon, and a military division that would have multi-coloured stripes in the centre.

Old Shatterhand is a fictional character in Western novels by German writer Karl May (1842–1912).  They are the German friend and blood brother of Winnetou, the fictional chief of the Mescalero tribe of the Apache.  They are the main character in the Eurowestern by the same name from 1964, starring Lex Barker, as they do in six more films of the Winnetou film series.
Characterisation
Old Shatterhand is the alter ego of Karl May, and May themselves maintained that they experienced all the adventures in person, even though in fact they did not visit America until after they wrote most of their well-known Western stories, and never traveled west of Buffalo, NY. Most of the stories are written from a first-person perspective, and Winnetou often calls Old Shatterhand my brother Scharli ('Scharli' being a German phonetic approximation of 'Charlie', and ultimately meaning Karl in German). May also wrote stories about the same character traveling the Orient, where they are known as Kara Ben Nemsi.
May attached the prefix Old to the names of several of their characters, considering it to be typically American and a sign of the characters' great experience. In the stories, Old Shatterhand is given the name by their friend Sam Hawkens (who also originates from Germany but is already an old-timer in the American West), as they were able to knock their opponents unconscious with a single punch from their fist aimed at the head (specifically the temple).
Old Shatterhand owns two famous rifles, the Bärentöter (Bear Killer) and the Henrystutzen (Henry carbine), both made by a fictional gunsmith called Henry in St. Louis (based on gunsmith Benjamin Tyler Henry 1821–1898). The Henrystutzen was able to fire 25 shots without reloading, probably a hyperbolic reference to the Henry rifle. Old Shatterhand rode a horse called Hatatitla (Lightning), which they got from Winnetou, who rode the horse's brother, called Iltschi (meaning Wind).
The tales may have been an influence on the creation of the Lone Ranger media franchise. Christian Tramitz parodied Shatterhand as a character called Ranger in the "Apahachi and Ranger" sketches for Michael Herbig's comedy show Bullyparade and their cinematic adaptation Der Schuh des Manitu.

Further mentioning
In Unter Würgern (1879, since 1893 as Die Gum in Orangen und Datteln), a story set in the Orient, the name Old Shatterhand appeared for the first time: the otherwise anonymous first-person narrator mentions casually that this name was given to them in the Plains.
In the chapter An der Tigerbrücke directly written for the omnibus edition Am Stillen Ocean (1894) the first-person narrator called Charley indicates their identity with Kara Ben Nemsi and Old Shatterhand.
In the story Im Reiche des silbernen Löwen IV (1903) Kara Ben Nemsi says once they were Old Shatterhand.
Movies
The character of Old Shatterhand was played in the German Karl May movies of the 1960s by American actor Lex Barker.
Der Schatz im Silbersee (The Treasure of Silver Lake) (1962), dir.: Dr. Harald Reinl
Winnetou 1. Teil (Apache Gold) (1963), dir.: Dr. Harald Reinl

In contrast to the stories in the movies Unter Geiern (1964) and Der Ölprinz (1965) Old Surehand (starring Stewart Granger) was the hero instead of Old Shatterhand. Old Surehand is another character created by Karl May. Karl May dedicated three volumes to him, who, like Old Shatterhand, is a renowned Western hero and best friends with the Native Americans. Unlike Old Shatterhand, Old Surehand is a half-blood Native himself, though raised in a white family.

The Grenfell Tower Inquiry is a British public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people and destroyed Grenfell Tower on 14 June 2017. It was ordered by Prime Minister Theresa May on the day following the fire.
May be announced on 29 June 2017 that the inquiry would be chaired by retired judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick, with the immediate priority "to establish the facts of what happened at Grenfell Tower in order to take the necessary action to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again". They promised that "No stone will be left unturned by this inquiry." On 15 August 2017, the terms of reference of the Inquiry were announced. The first hearing opened on 14 September 2017.
The Inquiry is divided into two phases: Phase 1 which addressed the events on the night of the fire, and the ongoing Phase 2 which will investigate the wider situation. Hearings for Phase 1 were held in June–December 2018 in Holborn, Central London. The report for the findings of Phase 1 was published on 30 October 2019. The Phase 2 hearings commenced on 28 January 2020 at a location in Paddington. Hearings after 16 March 2020 were suspended until further Covid-19 resilient arrangements could be put in place.
Background
Grenfell Tower was a 24-storey residential tower block in North Kensington, London, England. It was completed in 1974, as part of the first phase of the Lancaster West Estate.
The concrete structure's top 20 storeys consisted of 120 flats, with a total of 200 bedrooms. Its first four storeys were nonresidential until its most recent refurbishment in 2015–2016, which converted two of them to residential use, bringing it up to 127 flats and 227 bedrooms. It also received new plastic framed windows and new cladding with thermal insulation.
A major fire seriously damaged the building on 14 June 2017, causing the deaths of 72 of the 293 people who were believed to be in the 129-flat tower that night.
Initiation
The day after the fire broke out, Theresa May, the then prime minister, announced that there would be an inquiry into its causes. They made a statement to Parliament on 22 June announced a judge-led inquiry, saying "No stone will be left unturned by this Inquiry".
Sophie Khan, who acted as solicitor for some families in the Lakanal House fire, told BBC Two's Newsnight that inquests would be better for the families as they would allow the families to participate and ask questions. They said the coroner was independent but a public inquiry was government-led and they wondered what information the Prime Minister knew that they wanted to hide. Another solicitor, Louise Christian, who also acted for families in relation to Lakanal House, wrote in The Guardian that a public inquiry was the best approach. They wrote about a promised public inquiry for Lakanal House being "downgraded to an inquest" and that inquests would be delayed by a criminal investigation. They acknowledged that victims' interests are often sidelined in a public inquiry but wrote that the scope of a public inquiry is wider and that a rapid inquiry would put the government under more pressure to implement its findings immediately.
Appointment of Martin Moore-Bick
On 29 June, May announced that Sir Martin Moore-Bick, a retired judge, would lead the inquiry. They stated that "Before the Inquiry starts Sir Martin will consult all those with an interest, including survivors and victims' families, about the terms of reference." Moore-Bick met some survivors of the fire that day, and cautioned against giving the inquiry too much scope.
The appointment was met with some criticism from survivors, as well as Emma Dent Coad, the MP for Kensington. The chief criticisms were towards Moore-Bick's background in commercial law, their different social background to the survivors and their previous ruling in a Westminster City Council case, in which they had allowed a local resident to be rehoused 50 miles away. This decision had been overturned on appeal by the Supreme Court. Dent Coad said "We need somebody who can do the detail but we need somebody who can actually understand human beings as well." During two public meetings held by the Inquiry before the finalisation of the terms of reference, various residents criticised the lack of diversity of the Inquiry panel, saying that it did not represent the community.
An anonymous legal columnist in the New Statesman wrote that "The bulk of this objection, it appears, arises out of a rapidly cultivated image of Sir Martin as an establishment Mr Whitewash." The columnist argued that Moore-Bick's background as a "fact finder" in commercial law made them far better suited to the role than a criminal judge, and that getting the inquiry to empathise with the survivors "can be achieved without sacking the chair and starting again." Lord Chancellor David Lidington said Moore-Bick would lead the inquiry "with impartiality and a determination to get to the truth and see justice done".
Terms of reference
The inquiry leadership held a consultation on the inquiry's terms of reference throughout July 2017, which concluded on 4 August.
On 30 June, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn wrote to May to say that the inquiry's terms should be broad, because the fire had "much wider implications for national policy issues".
Former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said that "The inquiry has got to look at how [the regulatory] regime developed, or I think the residents would feel they were let down." On 17 July, they again to May, saying: "As I set out in my letter dated 30 June, there is considerable concern among residents and others that the judge leading the inquiry has already been directed towards a narrowly defined Terms of Reference, which will not bring residents the answers they seek."
On 15 August 2017, Theresa May announced the terms of reference. The inquiry's role would be to examine "the circumstances surrounding the fire", including its causes, how it spread to the whole building, and the adequacy of the regulations and safety measures in place.
Social housing
Labour Party politicians and some survivors have argued that the inquiry should include an examination of national policy in national policy towards social housing. In their letter to Theresa May proposing the Terms, which were agreed without amendment, Moore-Bick had noted that many of those affected by the fire and others had been in favour of this. They argued, however, that this would add significantly to the time required to complete their work, and that such an examination was better suited to a different kind of process and not to a judge-led inquiry. in their response, Theresa May said that the Housing Minister Alok Sharma would "personally meet and hear from as many social housing tenants as possible" both in the immediate area and further afield.
In response, Corbyn wrote an open letter to May saying: "The fire has raised profound concerns about the way that social housing is provided and managed in this country, and I as well as many survivors worry that without a wider focus, the inquiry will fail to get fully to grips with the causes of the fire." Corbyn also said May should "immediately set out a clear, independent and thorough process for identifying and addressing the broader failings that led to the Grenfell fire." Matt Wrack of the Fire Brigades Union said, "Central government has created the housing and fire safety regime and central government must be held to account for any failings in it. Yet the terms of reference signed off by Theresa May appear designed to avoid this."
Controversies
Two former panel members from the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse raised concerns about the ability of the inquiry to be independent of the government.
Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, argued that the order of the inquiry made the fire service's role too prominent, while other issues will be addressed in the second phase when public interest will have faded.
On 7 January 2018, an open letter to the Prime Minister signed by 71 academics and several politicians was published. This described concern for a possible conflict of interest of the auditors KPMG, who audited the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and companies responsible for the cladding on Grenfell Tower. This was viewed by signatories as a conflict with their neutrality on the enquiry. In response, KPMG agreed to immediately withdraw from the enquiry and waive its fees.
Systemic racism
The Grenfell Next of Kin group, accuses the Royal Borough of Kensington of “contemptuous disregard” in the decision-making processes that led to the tragedy. It said “Systemic racism goes deep to the heart of the problem that caused the catastrophe. Questions around race and social class is at the heart of this truth-seeking and we would be grateful if you can revisit it and add it as an extra module.”
Phase 1
Phase 1 Recommendations
There were 46 recommendations embedded within 35 paragraphs of chapter 33 of the four-volume full report, and published again in the executive summary. The press have printed a selection. For example, The Guardian published:
A law requiring owners and managers of high-rise residential buildings to provide their local fire and rescue service with information about external wall materials and building plans.
Fire brigade inspections of high-rise buildings to be improved and crews trained to carry out more thorough risk evaluations. Regular inspections of lifts intended to be used by firefighters are needed.
Communications between fire brigade control rooms, where emergency calls are received, and incident commanders must improve and there must be a dedicated communication link.
Government should develop national guidelines for carrying out partial or total evacuations of high-rise residential buildings.
Fire doors in all multi-occupancy, residential properties should be urgently inspected.
Improvements should be made to the data links provided by helicopters of the National Police Air Service.
Phase 2
The longer Phase 2 commenced in 2019 and was seriously delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Phase 2 is divided into eight modules:
The 2015-16 refurbishment
The testing, certification and marketing of the cladding panels and external insulation
The management of Grenfell Tower, including how residents' complaints were handled
Central and local government responses to the disaster
The response of London Fire Brigade
Building regulations and enforcement
Remaining expert evidence
Evidence relating to the deceased
Related actions
The Metropolitan Police Service are investigating possible criminal manslaughter and corporate manslaughter charges. They will delay handing the evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) until after the inquiry, but have already conducted at least 13 interviews under caution. Questioning suggests that charges could be laid under the Health and Safety at Work Act which obliges employees to 'take reasonable care for the health and safety of anyone "who may be affected by their acts or omissions at work." There are also threats of civil litigation. Arconic and Celotex are facing civil litigation from the bereaved in US courts, which lawyers estimate could cause a payout worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Quotation
Adrian Williamson QC, counsel for the bereaved and survivors, said the evidence revealed “an industry in which Arconic, Celotex and Kingspan were content to push hazardous products into the marketplace and sought to market them dishonestly”.

Pringle Creek is a small tributary of the Willamette River that drains a area of Marion County in the U.S. state of Oregon. The entire watershed lies within the urban growth boundary of the City of Salem. Pringle Creek's tributaries include Clark Creek, West Fork Pringle Creek, West Middle Fork and East Fork.
Course
Pringle Creek consists of a network of small streams with courses greatly altered since the 19th century by urban development. The streams flow on the surface in places, in pipes and culverts in other places, and have been otherwise modified by artificial inflows and diversions.
West Fork Pringle Creek begins in springs southwest of the main stem and flows generally north and slightly east to its confluence with East Fork Pringle Creek near 14th Street and Oxford Street. East Fork Pringle Creek and West Middle Fork Pringle Creek drain farm fields near Interstate 5 southeast of downtown Salem. East Fork Pringle Creek flows generally northwest, receiving the north-flowing West Middle Fork from the left slightly upstream of the larger stream's confluence with West Fork Pringle Creek.
Clark Creek, another small tributary rising south of the city's center, enters Pringle Creek from the left at Bush's Pasture Park. Pringle Creek then flows between the park and Deepwood Estate, crosses under Mission Street, flows between Salem Cardiology and the site of the former Oregon School for the Blind on the left and Salem Hospital and Pringle Park on the right. After passing under the hospital, the creek receives Shelton Ditch, which carries water diverted from Mill Creek, from the right. Pringle Creek then flows through Pringle Plaza to Mirror Pond, where the Mill Race, another diversion from Mill Creek, enters from the right. The combined waters then flow under Commercial Street and a former Boise Cascade mill to Willamette Slough on the Willamette River.
Watershed
Pringle Creek's drainage basin lies within the Salem urban growth boundary. Small watersheds that border the basin are Croisan Creek to the west, Willamette Slough East to the west and northwest, Mill Creek to the north and east, and Battle Creek to the south.
About 60 percent of the watershed was developed as urban in 2002, while about 27 percent was used for farming. The main crops grown in the basin are grass seed and hay. McNary Field (Salem Municipal Airport) and the site of the former Fairview Training Center are in the Pringle Creek basin.
History
The creek is named for Virgil K. Pringle, who emigrated from Missouri to Oregon in 1846 and settled a donation land claim near the stream. The Southern Pacific Railroad, which later built a South Salem station in the vicinity, changed its name to Pringle in 1925. The station closed in the 1980s, but the name is still used by a post office branch and a shopping center.

Cytoplasmic determinants are special molecules which play a very important role during oocyte maturation, in the female's ovary. During this period of time, some regions of the cytoplasm accumulate some of these cytoplasmic determinants, whose distribution is thus very heterogenic. They play a major role in the development of the embryo's organs. Each type of cell is determined by a particular determinant or group of determinants. Thus, all the organs of the future embryo are distributed and operating well thanks to the right position of the cytoplasmic determinants. The action of the determinants on the blastomeres is one of the most important ones. During the segmentation, cytoplasmic determinants are distributed among the blastomeres, at different times depending on the species and on the type of determinant. Therefore, the daughter cells resulting from the first divisions are totipotent : they can, independently, lead to a complete individual. That is not possible after the cytoplasmic determinants have been distributed in the differentiated blastomeres.
Mosaic development
During the mosaic development, the future embryo contains all the distinct cytoplasmic determinants that are distributed in distinct cells. Regions of the organism differentiate very quickly if each cell contains specific cytoplasmic determinants since the first divisions : then the cell divides to give all the other cell of its type, and the same process happens in all types of cells in the organism.
As a result, in the case of the mosaic development, cell totipotence disappears very quickly during segmentation. Indeed, each new created cell determines a new region of the future organism, and it is independent from the other ones : thus development is independent from interaction between cells. It is most of all known in certain animals as nematodes C. elegans, or ascidians (marine animals).
Regulation development
Other animals show regulation development; their cells show totipotence for a longer time. In these animals, cytoplasmic determinants are more rapidly distributed between newly created cells. Mammals are an example of animals that undergo regulation development.
Presumptive territories map
The zygote already contains the future organization of the embryo, through cytoplasmic determinants distribution. Presumptive Territories Maps could be established simply by coloring particular regions of the zygote's cytoplasm.

Mary Towq Ghosh (Arabic: ماري طوق غوش; born 1963) is a Lebanese translator and writer.  They are famous for the Arabization of internationally recognized novels, such as Yasunari Kawabata's "The House of the Sleeping Beauties" and Peter Handke's "The Left-Handed Woman," as well as translated French poems composed by the great Abbas Beydoun and Abdo Wazen. She, too, worked as a writer for a number of Lebanese and Arab newspapers, in which they published short stories and critical articles.
Education
In 1990, Mary enrolled in Lebanese University, from which they obtained their bachelor's degree in French literature.
Career
Mary have always loved to write, and had a number of their short stories and articles published in Lebanese and Arab newspapers. They hope to publish their own novel one day; one in a Lebanese context but following the same rhythm as "Soul Mountain" novel. Another novel that inspired them was Mathias Énard's "Zone," which is distinguished by the fast-paced narration of events, and for being composed of only one sentence. Mary preferred novels like these seeing that it best suited their style of writing. In their interview with Al-Jarida newspaper, Mary expressed that they are working on overcoming the fear of publishing a piece of work in their own voice.
Yasunari Kawabata's "The House of the Sleeping Beauties" was the first novel that Mary translated into French. Them work was first recognized by one of their friends, who, upon reading a chapter of Mary's translated novel, sent it to the editorial director of As-Safir newspaper, Elias Khoury, who was also impressed by Mary's work, and requested the full copy of the novel. Khoury then sent the novel to the founder of Dar Al Adab for publishing and distribution, Dr. Suhayl Idris, who published it. Despite the communications blackout and impassable roads which delayed the delivery of news, Mary was happy to learn about the publication of their translated novel, which, in turn, pushed them to pursue their career in the field of translation. Although they are not passionate about translation, they considered it as means to continue exploring in the field of literature. They took the habit in translating the works that only interested her, and did so in plain, yet catchy, language. They vowed to never stop until they have completed translating all the works of literature that they have enjoyed reading. Besides, they translated poems composed by renowned poets, such as Abbas Beydoun and Abdo Wazen, into French, as well as screenplays composed by the late Randa Chahal.
In 2017, Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism launched «Kalima Project for Translation» and displayed many of Mary's literary translations, including, most notably, "Bad Weather" novel by the French writer, Marie NDiaye.
Mary is currently working as a teacher in Byblos District, which is also their city of residence.

Bustan Abraham () was an Israeli band playing mostly instrumental music, which existed between 1991 and 2003. Its name means "Abraham's garden"; the reference to the common ancestor of both Jewish and Islamic traditions intending to imply a unifying theme. The band was called a pioneer in the realm of world music.
History
The band was born of jam sessions organized during several months by the qanun player and music promoter Avshalom Farjun, in collaboration with the violin and oud player Taiseer Elias. These sessions brought together musicians with various musical backgrounds such as Arab music, Turkish music, jazz, flamenco, western classical music, and blues. Eight musicians finally stayed to form Bustan Abraham. They made their debut at the Israeli International Arts Festival. The band was collaborative: each member brought their own ideas and composed part of the repertoire, and although it was composed mainly of Israeli Jewish musicians, two of its members were Palestinians.
Thank to this mix, it was perceived as a symbol of bringing the two groups together. The members nevertheless always insisted on the fact that their approach was foremost a musical one. Their aim was to drag from different traditions to create an entirely new music.
In the years which followed the signing of the Oslo agreements, the group played in numerous concerts and festivals in Europe, Asia and United States. It also recorded with musicians of different backgrounds, like Ross Daly, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Keyvan Chemirani and Zakir Hussain. Their albums generally sold about 25 0000 copies each. Three of Bustan Abraham's members, (Taiseer Elias, Zohar Fresco and Nassim Dakwar also performed in trio with a more specifically Arabo-Turkish repertoire, under the name of Zyriab Trio. Taiseer Elias and Miguel Herstein performed in duo under the name White Bird.
After Benjamin Netanyahu became Prime Minister, in 1996, and even more after the beginning of the Second Intifada, in 2000, invitations abroad became scarcer. The band finally disbanded in 2003, as different viewpoints had emerged on the musical direction to take and as several of its musicians were increasingly busy with other projects.
Some of its members kept on playing together on an occasional basis and four of them formed a new band at the end of 2011, Bustan Quartet. They performed in festivals in the United States and in Israel.

The Ara Canal or Gyeongin Ara Waterway (Hangul: ) is a canal built in 2012 in South Korea, linking the Han River to the Yellow Sea. It extends from Incheon district Seo-gu to Seoul district Gangseo-gu. The purpose of the canal is to provide flood control and recreational opportunities.
History
Choe I, son of Choe Chung-heon, attempted to construct a canal close to the canal site in the Goryeo period, but the project was technologically unfeasible. One of the Joseon kings made a similar attempt but it too failed.
The modern Gulpocheon River "Waterproof Road" project started in 1992. The river had issues with unusual flows. In particular, a flood in the summer of 1987 resulted in six thousand victims in the Incheon area. To solve this problem, a project to floodproof the river was undertaken, starting with a five-year survey. In 1995, the Gyeongin Ara Canal project was planned, but controversies followed for the next 20 years.
The project was started in 2009 and completed in 2012.
Summary of the Ara Canal project
Controversy
Controversy over the construction of the Ara Canal can be traced back to 1995. Several scenarios for the Gulpocheon Waterproof Road project were thought feasible. Among others, one proposed idea was to dig the waterway in such a way as to discharge water into the Yellow Sea. Another idea was that the municipality of Gimpo would be home to a reservoir. Though the latter idea was more economical, the former was selected in order to boost Korea's economy. One of the waterways was extended in the direction of the Yellow Sea (width: 40~80m, length: 14.2 km). A 3.8 km length of waterway to the Hangang river was also constructed.
After a lengthy discussion, the government allowed private sector investment, and Hyundai Engineering & Construction was selected as the main contractor in 1995. However, with no economic benefit and a negative effect on the ecosystem, public opinion turned against the project. Business operators and the Ministry of Construction and Transportation submitted an 'economic analysis' and demand a prediction report to demonstrate the project's validity. As a result of this outcry, eight reports were made for Gyeongin Ara Canal. The cost-benefit report about Gyeongin Ara Canal submitted by the Korea water Resources corporation gained 2.08 and 2.2 scores in 1996. However, when the IMF crisis occurred, the project was cut.
After the IMF crisis passed in 2002, the Ministry of Construction and Transportation requested a Korea Development Institute (KDI) report of demand prediction and cost analysis. This time the score was 0.8166 and on reanalysis, the score remained below 1. However, the Ministry rejected the report and delayed service costs to adjust the report. The KDI resubmitted the report, taking into account eight possible scenarios including the method of main traffic road and whether road tolls would be implemented or not. The result was 0.9223 to 1.2807. However, in 2003, the Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea confirmed the larger result. The project was stopped and disciplinary action was requested.
In August 2004, the Ministry of Construction and Transportation assigned the project's service report to a Netherlands company and obtained a 1.76 score in March 2007. In 2008, KDI investigated this report again and submitted a score result of 1.065. Also predicted in this report was the quantity of goods transported in 2011–290,000 4000 TEU related to containers, 6.3 million tons related to sea sand, 5 million tons related to steel, 6 million tons related to passengers. At this point, 80 percent of containers and 53 percent of sea sand are included in the quantity of goods transported in the Yellow Sea. The tailrace which discharged water to Hanyang river was completed in width 80 m. An opposition member of the National Assembly said that if the government did not consider the Ara Canal, the 40m width is enough.
Controversy resurfaced during the project period. In the summer of 2010, heavy rain caused damage near Ara Canal region. Environment groups insisted that this project had no effect in preventing disasters, like floods or heavy rain. These groups also said that the Ara canal had no plan to build 'rain water pump stations', 'rain water pipes' and so on. They demanded that this project be reexamined. However, the Korea Water Resource Corporation insisted that there would have been greater damage if the Ara canal did not exist. The damage was caused due to a lack of capacity in the pipe conduit. The Ara Canal helped to prevent great damage due to flowing rainwater. The Ara Canal's role is to discharge rainwater to the Yellow Sea by preventing floods. So, installing 'rain water pump stations' and 'rain water pipes' and others were not related to this project.

Anna L. "Pee Wee" Meyer (later Petrovic; born November 17, 1928) is a former female shortstop who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during the 1944 season. Born in Aurora, Indiana, they were one of the youngest players to sign a contract with the league at age 15.
Career
In 1942, chewing gum magnate and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley decided to start a women's pro softball league, concerned that the 1943 major-league season might be canceled because of World War II. Play in 1943 was a hybrid of softball and baseball, and the circuit initially called the All-American Girls Softball League, though early in the first season the name was changed to All American Girls Baseball League.
Meyer was one of the youngest players to sign a contract with the newly founded All-American Girls Professional Baseball League at age 15. They batted and threw right-handed and was invited to a tryout in the 1944 spring training and immediately was assigned to the Kenosha Comets. Meyer earned the promotion only after their father lied about their age: The league minimum was 16, as they were eight months short of becoming eligible.
During the 1944 mid-season, they were traded by Kenosha to the Minneapolis Millerettes in the same transaction that brought Elizabeth Mahon to the Comets. Meyer hit a combined .192 batting average in 142 games. Considering the league was using underhand pitching and a softball with a twelve-inch diameter, their average was acceptable for a middle infielder, especially with sharp defensive skills. In fact, All-Star outfielder Betsy Jochum clinched the batting title that year with a .296 mark.
At the end of the season, Meyer moved to a rival Chicago-based National Girls Baseball League to get more playing time and nearly as much money. They played for the Chicago Bluebirds for five years, and enjoyed being on the new team more because it required less travel and they also could hold down a job.
Personal life
In 1950, they married photographer George Petrovic. They raised two sons, David and George Jr.. As of 2008, they were living in Tucson, Arizona. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum recognized the AAGPBL with a permanent woman in Baseball exhibit in 1988.

Jaroslav Vaněk (20 April 1930 – 15 November 2017) was a Czech American economist and Professor Emeritus of Cornell University known for their research on economics of participation (labour-managed firms, worker cooperatives) and, in their earlier career, on the theory of international trade.
They graduated (matura) from a high-school in Prague, and left/emigrated shortly after the communist putsch of 1948. They received their diploma in statistics, mathematics and economics at the Sorbonne (1952), and a postgraduate degree in economics at the University of Geneva (1954). In 1955 they left for the US, where in 1957 they received their PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In 1964 they became professor of economics, and in 1969 of the international economics at Cornell University, where they directed from 1970 their program Participation and Labor Managed Systems, they also worked on strategies for its implementation in post-communist countries (1990s).
They were a visiting professor at the Belgrade's Institute of Economics (1972), the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium (1974), the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies in Humanities and Social Sciences (1975-6) and the International Institute of Social Studies in The Hague (1978).
In 1971, Vaněk worked as an advisor to the government of Peru and in 1978-79 to the Prime Minister of Turkey. In addition, they advised a number of participatory enterprises/employee-owned companies worldwide. In 1986 they founded and since directs the STEVEN Foundation (Sustainable Technology and Energy for Vital Economic Needs) that develops technologies suitable for the developing countries.
They were an important contributor to the Heckscher–Ohlin model, which provides a macroeconomic attempt of explanation of international trade and countries' specializations.
Vaněk wrote The General Theory of Labour-Managed Market Economies, a seminal work on self-management. Their work in the economics of participation included The Participatory Economy: An Evolutionary Hypothesis and a Strategy for Development which reviewed behaviour of labour-managed firms in more social spheres beyond their interests in net revenue per worker.

The main areas of machine building are the preparation of machine tools, equipment of tractors and automobiles, shipbuilding, aircraft building, Agricultural Machine Building, Electrical Engineering, Radio Engineering and automation equipment.
History
Extraction of oil by industrial method started in 1848 in Baku. The first metal processing plant was built in 1858 in Baku. In 1859, the oil refining plant was put into operation in Baku. In subsequent years, mechanical engineering and metalworking enterprises were established to serve these sectors due to the development of oil, chemistry and shipping.
During 1911–1913 years, there were 12 machine-building plants in Baku, and 127 metalworking enterprises were operating in Baku at the beginning of World War I. 8066 people worked in the construction of those enterprises.
During the Second World War, mainly spare parts for military technic, military equipment and weapons were produced in the machine–building plants moved from many industrial cities of the former Soviet Union to Baku. The development of the machine-building industry in the Republic is related to the development of the oil industry in the late 19th and early 20th century. The equipment imported from abroad was repaired in the workshops of the Nobel brothers, Rothschild, Taghiyev, Mukhtarov, Benkendorf in subsequent years. These workshops are the basis of future machine-building plants. During the Great Patriotic War, 95% of productive capacity of Azerbaijan's machine-building enterprises was directed to the production of military technic and equipment.
The majority of machine-building equipment of Azerbaijan are produced by enterprises that are part of “Azneftkimyamash” OJSC. In the past, about 70% of the equipment using for oil and gas extraction and repairs of wells in the entire oil-producing area of the Soviet Union belonged to Azerbaijan. The history of the oil and gas machine building industry of Azerbaijan dates back to 1935.
"Azneftkimyamash" Open Joint Stock Company was established on the basis of the State Company "Azneftkimyamash" by the Presidential Decree No 649 on March 22, 2001. Thus, the Azerbaijan Petroleum Machine building Industry entered a new stage.
The foundation of the Baku Deepwater Jackets Factory was laid in 1978. Baku Deepwater Jackets Factory was commissioned in 1984, is a one of giant industrial enterprise producing welding electrodes and performed pipe painting works in Azerbaijan. Overall area of the factory consists of 315, 57 ha and coastal area was 200 ha. The first stationary offshore platform constructed in 1985 is currently being operated at the Gunashli field.

Anthimus (, / Antim) was Eastern Orthodox Metropolitan of Belgrade from 1827 until 1831.
Biography
Anthimus was born on the island of Andros around 1780. They were ordained a bishop in Constantinople. They were the bishop of Vratsa from 1804 to 1813, and then from 1813 to 1827 the bishop of Lovech, both within the Trnovo metropolitanate in Bulgaria, which was under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. There they were the bishop of Lovech, and they were called Anthimus II, because they inherited the seat of the bishop of the same name.
In the period from 1827 to 1831, Anthimus was the Metropolitan of Belgrade. They succeeded Metropolitan Cyril, who died the same year. Anthimus came to Serbia in August 1827. They were also the last Phanariot Greek to head the Metropolitanate of Belgrade, as the Sultan's Hatt-i humayun gave Serbs the right to "freedom of religion so that they could elect their own Serbian metropolitan instead of the Greek Phanariot." They anointed Prince Miloš Obrenović as the new Serbian ruler in December 1830 in the Orthodox Cathedral in Belgrade.
They were the head of the Belgrade metropolitanate until the election of Melentije Pavlović in 1831, who became the first Serb to head the renewed Metropolitanate of Belgrade. Then, Anthimus voluntarily withdrew from their diocese. They left Belgrade on 21 October 1831.
They first settled in Constantinople, and then in Athens, where they died.

Aston is a village about south of Witney in West Oxfordshire, England. The village is part of the civil parish of Aston, Cote, Shifford and Chimney. The southern boundary of the parish is the River Thames. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,374.
History
Until the 19th century Aston was a township in the ancient parish of Bampton. In 1866 the civil parish of Aston and Cote was separated from Bampton. In 1931 Aston and Cote was united with Chimney to form the civil parish of Aston Bampton, which was merged with Shifford in 1954 to form the parish of Aston Bampton and Shifford. The parish was later renamed Aston, Cote, Shifford and Chimney.
Parish church
The Church of England parish church of Saint James was built in 1839 with only a low squat tower and one bell. Later a spire and second bell were added. The Gothic Revival architect Joseph Clarke restored the building in 1862, even though it was only 23 years old at the time. The architect HGW Drinkwater made further alterations in 1885–89. The present ring of six bells was cast by John Taylor & Co. of Loughborough in 1883, the two original bells being taken in part exchange. Two brass plates in the church commemorate the names of local clergy and churchwardens at the time of the bells' dedication and benefactors who contributed to the cost, the balance of which was raised by public subscription. In 1992 the bells were restored and re-hung by White's of Appleton following two years of local fund-raising. In 1857 Aston, Cote and Shifford were made part of the ecclesiastical parish of Bampton Aston. It now forms part of the benefice of Bampton with Clanfield, which also includes the parish of Lew.
Pottery
Aston Pottery was founded in 1990 and now employs 50 people producing over 120 different patterns on 45 different shapes. The pottery also has a café and gardens.

The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep is a 2018 dungeon crawler video game developed by inXile Entertainment as a late fourth installment to the Bard's Tale trilogy from the 1980s.
Plot
Some two centuries after the now-legendary events from the original trilogy, one Bishop Henred of the Church of the Swordfather (a church militant and now the predominant religion in the land of Caith in which the games are set) has moved the faith to a more extreme and radically xenophobic outlook. Magic-users and non-humans such as dwarves, elves, and the goblinoid trow are now persecuted even though some still live among humans.
The game begins with the execution on the gallows of six people for being magic users, adventureres, or non-humans in the town of Skara Brae as witnessed by the initial player character, Melody the bard. They meet another bard, Rabbie, who escorts them to the Adventurer's Guild which, however, is stormed by paladins shortly afterwards. The player has the option to build another character at this point and continue with that character instead of Melody.
As the Adventurer's Guild is overrun, Rabbie leads the player through an escape tunnel to Skara Brae Below, the ruins of the old Skara Brae (destroyed just before the events of Bard's Tale III) that exist in a giant cave below the new town of the same name. There, the persecuted non-humans and adventurers have set up refugee camps around the old Adventurer's Guild building while paladins scour the subterranean ruins.
The initial mission is to check up on friends and allies up in Skara Brae and elsewhere. Over the course of these missions it is found that an unknown agency is committing crimes and blaming them on the non-humans in an apparent attempt to discredit them and sow civil unrest. As it turns out, the religions of other people and realms have similarly developed, and then been subverted by, malevolent militant sub-cults (much like the Church of the Swordfather, which is portrayed as an originally benevolent religion that underwent a dramatic shift towards malevolence only recently).
Over the course of these quests, the party size gradually grows to six members. (It grows from two character slots to six; some characters have to join the party at least temporarily to achieve certain short term goals, typically adding a character slot in the process, and can be exchanged for other characters after the specific quest revolving around their character is resolved. It is thus possible to create a party entirely made up of custom characters.)
It is gradually uncovered that a primordial evil, Yadis, seeks to end the dominance of men in the world. To this end Yadis, in alliance with the resurrected Mangar, Lagoth Zanta, and Tarjan, wants to open a rift that happens to lie under Skara Brae, incidentally explaining why the town always seemed to draw the attention of evil wizards.
Ultimately, Skara Brae is put to the torch and the population enslaved to dig through to the rift. Bishop Henred is revealed to be under Yadis's influence, and is eventually slain on the doorstep of the cathedral as the player party races to the dig site in the sewers below the cathedral to stop Yadis.
Gameplay
The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep is a party-based dungeon crawler role-playing video game with gameplay experienced from a first-person perspective.
Development and release
The Bard's Tale is a fantasy role-playing video game series established by Interplay Productions in the year 1985. Two sequels were released in the 1980s before the series went dormant. In 2004, inXile Entertainment developed and released a spin-off game to the series.
In January 2015, Brian Fargo, CEO of inXile Entertainment, announced plans to develop The Bard's Tale IV. Fargo's vision was to a creation a true successor to the original trilogy of Bard's Tale games. In May 2015, the studio announced that they would launch a Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund development costs for The Bard's Tale IV. InXile had previously used Kickstarter to successfully crowdfund previous projects—Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera.

Awards
The game was nominated for "Best Original Song" with "Across the Seven Realms" and "Best Sound Design for an Indie Game" at the 2019 G.A.N.G. Awards, and for "Best Audio Design" at The Independent Game Developers' Association Awards.
Reception
The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep received "mixed or average" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.
IGN noted that the game was bogged with technical issues, but called it "an RPG that's brimming with enjoyable, challenging fights, elaborate and entertaining puzzles, and plenty of visual and musical flair". Game Informer wrote that the game's combat was "a joy and handled with finesse" but criticized the combat system for not "hav[ing] the flexibility to take more than the necessities" and wrote that "...long puzzle mazes detract from the inspired combat system..." PC Gamer wrote, "...a number of the underlying systems are unforgivingly old-fashioned...Other elements don't feel 'old' so much as just rough or unfinished", and praised the combat, exploration and world. Eurogamer likened the game to a B movie in that "by not trying to please everybody it revels in being different", while similarly criticizing its technical issues and lack of polish and praising its score and puzzle design.. Destructoid reviewed the game negatively, writing, "The Bard's Tale IV is an absolute mess. The framerate is all over the place, and bugs are constantly rearing their ugly head to impede or altogether halt progress...While the combat and puzzles are interesting enough in their own right, starting in the dreary grey and brown town of Skara Brae is so…unimpressive. NPC models look like garbage and no NPC is ever moving around...even conversations feel stilted...", but praised the environments, tactical gameplay, and puzzles. GameSpot praised the game's soundtrack and heavily criticized its repetitive mechanics, linear map, dated visuals, shallow puzzles, and technical issues. Shacknews thought that the game had good character customization and an immersive world but took issue with the convoluted combat and lackluster story.

"Queen of the Broken Hearts" is a song featured on the 1983 album Keep It Up by the Canadian rock band Loverboy. The song was released as a single later that year, reaching #34 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #11 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. Despite being a relatively successful hit for the band, the song has not been included on the two main compilation albums released by the band; Big Ones (1989) and Loverboy Classics (1994).
The video for "Queen of the Broken Hearts" was the subject of an MTV contest in the summer of 1983, in which an MTV viewer won the chance to "star" in Loverboy's next video. The contest was won by a woman named Bridget Magnesi, who appeared very briefly in two shots, behind a bank of computer monitors about 15 seconds into the video.
The video was shot at Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles, where the desert, rock formations, and caves were utilized extensively for a number of popular science fiction television series and many B-movies dating from the early 1950s.

The Thomas J. Pappas Schools were a series of related alternative schools located in the Phoenix, Arizona area. A part of the Maricopa County Regional School District, the Thomas J. Pappas schools provided primary and secondary education to homeless children in the area. They were named for Thomas J. Pappas, a prominent Phoenix business person known for their strong support of homeless causes, who died in 1989. The schools closed in 2008 following several years of controversy and legal issues surrounding the schools' administrator, Sandra Dowling, the Maricopa County Superintendent of Schools.
History
The early beginnings of the school can be traced to a volunteer effort by Phoenix firefighters prior to 1989 of providing tutoring classes to local homeless children. Originally held in a shelter and later moved to a hotel, the first classes were attended by only 8 students.
Funding and resources were non-existent in the early days of the program and In an effort to determine whether the small fledgling volunteer effort could be stabilized and expanded into an official program, a group of local firefighters contacted Sandra Dowling, the newly elected Maricopa County School Superintendent . Realizing that homeless students were not receiving appropriate education services through the local school district, Dowling and the firefighters worked with the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) to change the plight of what turned out to be thousands of children over a twenty-year span. In 1990 Dowling founded the Thomas J. Pappas School for Homeless Children using the limited resources provided through state funding opportunities, federal grant monies and community donations to develop an official curriculum and provide school facilities for homeless children. A local Episcopal church housed the first classrooms before growth of the program in less than one academic year quadrupled the number of students requiring services. The move to a former car dealership that was leased and then renovated for use as a school for grades K-8, Dowling's program becoming the first school for the homeless children in Phoenix and evolved into a national model.
In response to continued growth in attendance a new school was constructed in 1997 serving grades 1-6 and the existing former "car dealership" was building was converted to a middle school. The concept was further expanded by the founding of the Tempe Thomas J. Pappas Elementary School in nearby Tempe in 2001. While originally housed in a strip mall, the satellite school moved into a new facility constructed in 2004.
The Pappas Schools enjoyed the support of national, state, local and religious community leaders. Players from all of the local sports organizations visited and volunteered at the school. Players would don chef hats and aprons and serve meals for major holidays including Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter. They would be seen on campus's on a regular basis playing on the playground with the children or being a "classroom helper" for the day.
The school thrived with the help of volunteer organizations such as the Creative Women of Pinnacle Peak, Rotary and Lions clubs, volunteers from local retirement communities and other school children in more prosperous school districts that wanted to help. Retirees from as far away as Sun City, Pebble Creek and Apache Junction would drive weekly and sometimes daily to be a reading coach for the students.
Corporate and community sponsors included Salt River Project, Nationwide Vision, Arizona Diamondbacks, Phoenix Suns and Arizona Cardinals. United Airlines sponsored annual fantasy flights for students annually. Contributions from all over Arizona and throughout the United States allowed the school to have an on-site medical center that provided medical, vision and dental care. Volunteer doctors and dentists provided care to many students for the first time in their young lives. Students had an opportunity to visit the "birthday closet", take home food from the food pantry on a regular basis or to visit "The Gap", the on-site clothing room that provided clean clothes and a new pair of shoes for the children as needed.
Political issues and closure
As alternative schools that did not operate under established geographical school districts, the Thomas J. Pappas schools never enjoyed funding from a traditional school tax district. The Maricopa County Schoolhouse Foundation was established as a 501C-3 charitable foundation to organize fundraising activities to support the schools.
Severe financial issues created concern as to the future of the Pappas schools. In 2006, it was discovered the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors had diverted and withheld more that $3.8 million in funding to the school. In an attempt to conceal the funding scheme, county leadership led by County Manager David Smith, enlisted the assistance of the Sheriff and alleged that Dowling misappropriated the funds instead. A massive legal and public battle ensued that led to an investigation into certain accounting practices called into question a number of officials related to the school. During the court proceedings it was discovered and entered into the court records that county leaders and the Sheriff "lied, misled and distorted evidence" presented to the grand jury. Counts that were remanded back to the grand jury were never refiled and the remaining counts were dismissed and Dowling and other leaders that had been targeted were exonerated. However, the public fight took its toll on the district's leadership and teachers, fearing they would not get paid, were taking other job opportunities. . Judicial intervention and an outpouring of support from local charities secured the schools for a brief time.
Questions regarding the school's financial stability continued well into 2007. In spite of financial help from outside sources the school continued to operate at a deficit because the Maricopa County finance department refused to allow the county treasurer to pay employees or vendors. As a result, by October the school district had racked up a debt of an estimated $2.9 million. Although funds were in school district accounts to make the required payments, without approval from the Board of Supervisor's the Treasurer was not allowed to issue payment. Attempts to solve the school's political battles with Dowling did not succeed, and on October 18, 2007, a settlement was approved that would require the closure of all 3 Pappas schools by June 30, 2008. Students attending Pappas schools were expected to register at more traditional schools following the closure date.
Dowling did not to run for re-election as county schools superintendent in the wake of the Pappas Schools controversy and their ongoing related legal issues.
Dowling was eventually cleared of all charges. They sued Maricopa County for bringing false charges against them and was awarded a cash settlement in 2013. In 2009, they received a written apology published on the editorial page of the state's largest newspaper, The Arizona Republic for their coverage of the events The "witch hunt" against Dowling has been extensively documented and reported on by many leading publications in the state. They now enjoy being involved in political activities again, their role as an educational leader and business owner in the community.
The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors closed the Thomas J. Pappas Schools in 2008. The Tempe campus presently houses a public charter school. The Phoenix campus, once listed as a Point of Pride by the city, was demolished in March 2011.

The Nearest Thing To Heaven was a sizable hit for Bunny Walters in 1974. It reached #10 in the New Zealand charts. It was also their last hit.
Background
The song was composed by Tony Macaulay, Gary Sulsh, and Stuart Leathwood. The song was originally recorded by Ben Thomas, released in the UK on Bell Records BELL 1272 in 1972. The version recorded by Bunny Walters was released in 1974 on Impact IR 1084. The B side contained "Songs We Sang Together" which was also composed by Tony Macaulay. This version that Walters recorded was produced by Alan Galbraith, and was the one that became the hit. This single followed their previous release, the Bernie Allen arranged "Helena", which even though a gold disc entry, wasn't a hit.
Chart performance
The September 7, 1974, issue of Billboard recorded the song at No. 10 in New Zealand. That was the highest position it reached during a nine-week run on the chart. Walters didn't have any more chart hits after that.

Yamamoto is a damaged lunar impact crater that is located to the north of the large walled plain D'Alembert. To the north-northeast is the crater Avogadro. This feature lies on the northern hemisphere of the Moon's far side.
Several parts of the crater rim are overlain by subsequent impacts, particularly along the northeastern section which has been almost completely obliterated. The southwest part of the floor is more irregular than the remainder of the interior, and may have been overlain by ejecta from D'Alembert or elsewhere. The northeastern floor is relatively level and featureless.
Satellite craters
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Yamamoto.

Grave of the Vampire is a 1972 American vampire film directed by John Hayes, and starring William Smith, Michael Pataki, and Lyn Peters. Its plot follows a vampire who rapes a living woman, resulting in the birth of a child who feeds only on blood. It is based on the novel The Still Life by David Chase.
The film is also known as Seed of Terror (American reissue title).
Plot
In 1940 California, college student Paul proposes to their girlfriend, Leslie Hollander, in the cemetery where they shared their first kiss. During the proposal, Caleb Croft—a serial rapist and murderer in life, now a vampire—awakens from their crypt. Caleb brutally murders Paul and rapes Leslie. A local lieutenant, Panzer, investigates the crime, and discovers that Croft's tomb is also empty.
Panzer visits a catatonic Leslie in the hospital. When they show them a mugshot of Croft, they violently recoil. It turns out that Croft was a prolific murderer and rapist in Massachusetts, who was electrocuted to death in the Boston Subway while attempting to flee from police. To prevent locals from vandalizing their grave, their body was entombed in California. While wandering through the town, Croft enters the home of a local housewife, kills them and feeds on their blood. Before Leslie is discharged from the hospital, their doctor informs them they are pregnant, but that the fetus appears abnormal. Leslie believes the child to be Paul's, but their doctor insists they get an abortion, which they adamantly refuse. Meanwhile, Panzer returns to Croft's tomb, but is killed by the vampire in the process.
Some months later, Leslie—orphaned by their parents—gives birth to their son. Them housekeeper, Olga, urges Leslie to contact the town doctor, as the infant is pallid and will not take milk. Eventually, Leslie soon finds that the newborn gains strength by consuming blood. Leslie begins drawing their own blood into syringes and filling bottles to feed the baby, whom they name James.
Thirty years later, Leslie dies. Blaming them for their mother's suffering, the adult James chooses to dedicate their life to hunting their father. In one of the towns along their journey, James enrolls in a folk mythology class, where they meet Anita Jacoby, a graduate student, and their roommate Anne Arthur. James is unaware that the professor, Adrian Lockwood, is in fact Caleb Croft, who has assumed a new identity. During their first seminar, James gains Croft's attention by espousing their knowledge of the story of Charles Croydon, a 17th-century Englishman thought to be a vampire, as well as the case of Caleb Croft. After class, Anne has a brief conversation with Croft, during which they tell them they remind them of their late wife, Sarah.
Later that night, Croft murders the university librarian. Meanwhile, James attends a party with Anita, who informs them they believe Croydon and Croft may have been the same person. James subsequently has Anne over to their apartment, and the two have sex. Meanwhile, Croft visits Anne and Anita's apartment, finding Anita there alone. Anita confronts Croft with their knowledge of their identity, and asks that they turn them into a vampire as well, so they can be their bride. When Croft denies Anita, they threaten to expose him, resulting in them slashing their throat. A short time later, Anne returns to their apartment and finds Anita's corpse. Croft themselves appears nearby. James hears Anne's screams and rushes into their apartment to rescue her; Croft escapes unseen.
The following evening, James and Anne visit Croft's lavish estate along with four other graduate students. There, Croft conducts a séance in which they hypnotize them. Croft calls out to their dead wife, Sarah, and instructs them to possess Anne. Instead, Anita, speaking from beyond the grave, possesses Anne's body, and exposes Croft as a vampire to the students. Croft sternly instructs Anne to cast Anita out of their body; they subsequently collapse on the floor. While James carries Anne upstairs, Croft kills the remaining students. James returns, and a violent struggle ensues between them and Croft. Realizing that Croft is their father, James drives a stake through their heart. Croft dies, but moments later, James begins to convulse in pain. Anne regains consciousness and stumbles upon the scene. James urges them to get away from him. Anne looks on in horror as James stares at them vacantly, now bearing fangs himself.

Development
Grave of the Vampire was made on an estimated budget of $50,000 and was shot in eleven days in downtown Los Angeles, California. Many of Pataki's fight scenes were performed by stunt coordinator Joe Pronto and one scene depicting an overhead lift was shot in reverse to achieve the effect.
Release
Grave of the Vampire released on September 13, 1972 and has since fallen into the public domain. The film has also been titled Seed of Terror. Per Clive Davies, the film was edited for American audiences and an uncut version was released to European audiences.
The film was first on Mill Creek Entertainment's "200 Tales of Terror" DVD Collection. Shout! Factory's Scream Factory line announced they are releasing the film on Blu-ray on April 16, 2019.
Reception
Upon its initial release Grave of the Vampire gained attention for its depiction of a mother cutting themselves to feed their child blood. It has since received praise from online outlets and critics decades after its initial release, with some critics noting that the film was "prescient in its anticipation of contemporary concerns". Tor.com noted that the movie was "notable for its details rather than its broad strokes. If you can watch it in the context of its times, it's quite revolutionary in its treatment of its female characters, allowing them a glimmer of equality in a genre where they were usually required to do little but look pretty and scream." Daily Dead noted that the film "changed things up a little and injected a bit of fresh plasma into a sub-genre desperate for a transfusion."

Brian Joshua Cook (born December 4, 1980) is an American former professional basketball player. They were drafted out of the University of Illinois with the 24th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers.
In 2004, Cook was named to the University of Illinois All-Century Team.
High school career
Cook played high school basketball at Lincoln Community High School in central Illinois where they led the Railsplitters to the quarterfinals of the 1999 Illinois High School Association class AA state boys basketball tournament. Cook scored 38 points in 2 IHSA tournament finals games, averaging 19.0 points per game. They were named to the 1998 State Farm Holiday Classic all-tournament team and was a 1999 McDonald's All-American. They were also named the 1999 Illinois Mr. Basketball after averaging 21.7 points, 10.1 rebounds, 3.2 blocks, 2.0 steals and 1.8 assists per game as a senior. Cook was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2016.
College career
Cook played 132 games in four years for the University of Illinois, most of them under coach Bill Self, and led the Illini in rebounding in each season. Cook was a versatile scorer from both inside and outside the paint, utilizing their height to score in the post and hitting three-point shots when left open. This helped them to earn co-Big Ten Freshman of the Year honors during their first-year student year at Illinois.
Cook helped lead the Illini to a number one seed in the 2001 NCAA Tournament, and the Illini cruised to the Elite 8, where they were upset in a hard-fought and controversial game by Cook's future teammate Luke Walton and the Arizona Wildcats.
As a senior in the 2002–03 season, Cook led the Fighting Illini in scoring with 20.0 points per game, and received the Chicago Tribune Silver Basketball as the Most Valuable Player of the Big Ten Conference. That same season, Cook was named second team All-American by The Sporting News, and third team All-American by the Associated Press, the National Association of Basketball Coaches, and The Basketball Times, as well as Big Ten Player of the Year and first team All-Big Ten by both the coaches and the media. Cook left Illinois as the school's third all-time leading scorer with 1,748 total points, at an average of 13.2 points per game, behind Deon Thomas and Kiwane Garris.
Professional career
Cook was selected with the 24th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers. They played sparingly in their rookie campaign as a backup to superstar center Shaquille O'Neal, and was mostly an interior player, notching only five three-point attempts out of 141 total field goal attempts. As their professional career evolved, however, Cook once again became a player who could play beyond the perimeter, after O'Neal moved on to the Miami Heat and Rudy Tomjanovich took over for Phil Jackson as Lakers' head coach. They were mainly used as a three-point specialist; 199 of 422 (or 47.2%) of Cook's field goal attempts were from behind the three-point arc. When Phil Jackson returned to coach the Lakers in 2005–06, Cook started to take less three-pointers again, which resulted in Cook improving their overall field-goal percentage from .417 in 2004–05 to .520 in 2005–06. It also resulted in an improvement in their three-point field-goal percentage, from .392 in 2004–05 to .441 in 2005–06. Their improved play kept Cook on the court more than their minutes played per game rose from 15.1 in 2004–05 to 19.4 in 2005–06.
On November 20, 2007, Cook was traded, along with Maurice Evans, to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Trevor Ariza.
On February 19, 2009, Cook was traded to the Houston Rockets in a three-team trade also involving the Magic and the Memphis Grizzlies. On February 20, 2010, they were waived by the Rockets.
On July 9, 2010, Cook signed with the Los Angeles Clippers.
On March 15, 2012, Cook was traded, along with a 2015 second-round pick, to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Nick Young.
Cook's final NBA game ever was during their time with the Wizards, as they played their final game on April 26, 2012 in a 104 - 70 win over the Miami Heat. Cook recorded 4 points and 1 rebound in their final game. On September 17, 2012, they re-signed with the Wizards. However, they were later waived by the Wizards on October 28, 2012.
In March 2013, Cook signed with Piratas de Quebradillas for the 2013 BSN season.
On September 30, 2013, Cook signed with the Utah Jazz. However, they were later waived by the Jazz on October 26, 2013.
On September 25, 2014, Cook signed with the Detroit Pistons. However, they were later waived by the Pistons on October 20, 2014. On December 28, 2014, they signed with Al-Riyadi of the Lebanese Basketball League. They left Al-Riyadi in mid-January after appearing in just three games. On February 10, 2015, they signed with Aguada of the Liga Uruguaya de Basketball, in Montevideo, Uruguay. They also managed just three games for Aguada.
On June 15, 2015, Cook signed with Chiba Jets of the Japanese National Basketball League.

Val d'Or (foaled 1902) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse who was only defeated 16 times in their career. Their wins included the Prix de Deux Ans, Grand Criterium, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Eclipse Stakes. During their racing career they were owned by Edmond Blanc and trained by Robert Denman. After retiring from racing they became a sire in Argentina.
Background
Val d'Or was a bay colt foaled in 1902. They were sired by British Triple Crown winner Flying Fox. Flying Fox was also a successful stallion in France, with their progeny also including Prix du Jockey Club winner Ajax, Poule d'Essai des Poulains and Prix du Jockey Club winner Dagor, Prix de la Forêt winner Adam and Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Gouvernant. Val d'Or's dam, Wandora, was a daughter of Bruce.
Racing career
Val d'Or was unbeaten in four starts as a two-year-old. Their wins came in the Prix de Deux Ans at Deauville, the Critérium de Maisons-Laffitte at Maisons-Laffitte, the Prix La Rochette at Longchamp and the Grand Criterium, also at Longchamp.
Returning as a three-year-old they won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp. In the Grand Prix de Paris they finished fourth behind winner Finasseur. It was widely believed than they were not at their best for the Grand Prix de Paris, due to them suffering from an illness that affected many horses in the stable. They then travelled over to England for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park. The favourite for the race was Epsom Derby winner Cicero at 8/13. Val d'Or was second favourite at 3/1, with Llangibby at 9/1. The three outsiders of the six-strong field were Polymelus, Henry the First and Challenger. Polymelus led the field away, being followed by Cicero and Val d'Or. Cicero took the lead as they turned into the finishing straight and was closely followed by Polymelus and Val d'Or. As they neared the finish Polymelus faded away and Val d'Or challenged Cicero for the lead, with Llangibby back in third place. Val d'Or and Cicero raced side by side until the finish, where Val d'Or got the better of Cicero by half a length. Third placed Llangibby was a further three quarters of a length behind, with Polymelus finishing in fourth. Val d'Or had been the strong favourite for the St. Leger Stakes with just a few days to go to the race. However, they were held up for three days in Boulogne due to rough seas and Blanc decided to withdraw them from the race.
Stud career
It had been intended for Val d'Or to stay in training as a four-year-old, but Edmond Blanc received an offer of £30,000 for them so stand at stud in Argentina, which they accepted. They met with some success as a sire there, with their progeny including Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini winner Ocurrencia.
Pedigree
Note: b. = Bay, br. = Brown, ch. = Chestnut
* Val d'Or was inbred 3 × 4 to Galopin. This means that the stallion appears once in the third generation and once in the fourth generation of their pedigree.

The collared towhee (Pipilo ocai) is a species of bird in the family Passerellidae that is endemic to Mexico. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist pine-oak montane forest and heavily degraded former forest. It occupies mountainous terrain from about .
This species, at , is a fairly large species. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the relatively short tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . Males weigh from and females from . In terms of weight, and standard bill and tarsal measurements, this is the largest species of emberizid overall, although related species, including Abert's, canyon and California towhees, outrank the collared towhee in overall length, as well as tail and wing length. In the collared towhee, the chestnut cap, yellowish green upperparts, black cheek and breast band, gray flanks, and white chin are curiously similar to that of the chestnut-capped brush finch, but note the latter's thinner breast band and more golden (not whitish) supercilium. The towhee's trilling song interspersed with chips is also very different from the brush-finche's very high-pitched hissing song.

The Ex-Mrs. Bradford is a 1936 American comedy-mystery film. William Powell and Jean Arthur star as a divorced couple who investigate a murder at a racetrack. This was the last film directed by Stephen Roberts before their untimely death from a heart attack.
The similarity between The Ex-Mrs. Bradford and M-G-M's The Thin Man (1934) and was speculated about the chances that RKO's film would eclipse After the Thin Man (1936), which was to be released later in the year, at the box office. Modern sources claim that the film was RKO's third most successful production of 1936.
Plot
Wealthy murder mystery writer Paula Bradford (Jean Arthur) returns from their worldwide travels to see their former husband, surgeon Dr. Lawrence "Brad" Bradford (William Powell). They had divorced them because they were always involving them in real-life murder cases, but they want them back. When a jockey riding the favorite dies while leading a race, they are convinced it was murder. They and Mike North (Frank M. Thomas), the horse's trainer, persuade the reluctant doctor to investigate. Brad is puzzled when they find traces of gelatin on the corpse.
Then they receive an envelope at home addressed to North. North telephones a little later to say they sent it and will come pick it up. Someone claiming to be North calls shortly afterward and instructs Brad to meet them somewhere else, but without the money. Curious, Brad opens the envelope to find a great deal of money and replaces it with some torn up magazine pieces. Suspicious, Brad takes a taxi, but gets out a short distance away and returns to their suite. As they anticipated, a burglar is inside looking for the envelope. When the two men start fighting, Paula tries to help to use a skull they pick up, but ends up knocking Brad out instead, allowing the intruder to get away.
Soon after, the doorbell rings. When Brad opens the door, North's body falls in. Police Inspector Corrigan (James Gleason) names Brad as the main suspect in the second death. Now Brad has to solve both murders to clear himself.
All sorts of suspects present themselves: Nick Martel (Robert Armstrong), a bookie who owed North $125,000 for a winning bet; Leroy Hutchins (Ralph Morgan), the owner of the winning horse; John Summers (Grant Mitchell), the favorite's owner; Mrs. Summers, who is seeing Martel behind their husband's back; and Summer's lawyer, Henry Strand (an uncredited Frank Reicher). Even Brad's receptionist, Miss Prentiss (Lila Lee), had been spotted with Martel. Brad discovers that North made the bet through someone else and Martel was instructed to send the money to an address they were given, but decided to confront North in person instead over what they considered to be deceit; though North claimed they did not place the bet, Martel did not believe them and gave them the money. Going to the address provided, Brad finds Paula already there. They then discover the body of Lou Pender (Paul Fix), the would-be burglar who had masqueraded as North, in a Murphy bed after they kill a spider. As Brad is examining the corpse, an unseen person shoots them from the window.  They are not seriously wounded.
Brad eventually figures out how the murders were committed. The killer put a deadly black widow spider inside a gelatin capsule, secretly attached it to the victim's body, and waited for the gelatin to melt from body heat, releasing the spider. Since the police have the $125,000, Brad assumes the killer will try the same trick again. The same two horses are scheduled to race against each other the next day, so Brad has film cameras set up around the racetrack. The murderer does strike again, but Brad had taken the precaution of inoculating the jockey beforehand.
Brad invites all of the suspects to their suite, hoping the culprit will stay away. When that fails, they screen the film footage they had taken. It shows Mr. Summers slipping a capsule down the jockey's back. Pulling out a gun, Summers admits their motive was revenge against their unfaithful wife and Martel. Brad subdues them before they can shoot the lovers. During the struggle, however, Paula once again knocks out their ex-husband with a vase. Despite this, in the end Brad marries Paula again.

The Battle of Ilava (called also Battle of Rudé Pole, Slovak: Bitka na Rudom poli) was a battle in the Hussite Wars between the Hussites and the Hungarian-Royalists army near Ilava in Upper Hungary (Slovakia) on November 9th, 1431 (sometimes date of November 10th or 11th is given).
In 1430 the army of the Hussites defeated the army of the Hungarians, Serbs and Royalists in the Battle of Trnava, but the casualties of the Hussites were quite big, making the victory not as successful.
In september of 1431 the Hussite army under Prokop the Great, Prokop the Lesser (Prokůpek) and Hanuš of Kolovrat again invaded present day Slovakia (also known as Upper Hungary) for the revenge of the death of Velek Koudelník of Březnice and for food replenishment. The Hussites captured city of Nitra and the Orebite forces conquered the Likava castle in Liptov county, on 29th September. The Taborite forces were looting settlements around cities of Trnava, Nitra and Levice.
Later, seeking to return home, Hussites were following river Váh to the north, hoping to cross the bridge at Hlohovec. They found the bridge destroyed and were forced to march on towards Ilava, where the Hungarians under the leadership of Miklós Rozgoyni (Mikuláš Rozgoň) and István Poharnok (Štefan Pohárnik) prepared a trap. The battle was fought on a field (Rudé pole, lit. red field) between Ilava and settlement of Košeca. Thanks to the intensive rain, the Hussites were not able to properly manoeuver and about 5,000 of them were killed or drowned trying to cross Váh. Around 250 Hussite war wagons and many cannons were captured. Rozgonyi executed many Taborite prisoners and their commander Zikmund Hořovský. Remains of the Hussite army retreated through the valley of Púchov back into Moravia.

Donna Lewis is a Welsh singer.  They are best known for the 1996 pop hit single "I Love You Always Forever", which peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart, and also peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, and the United States. In the latter country, the song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks, having been held off the summit by the Bayside Boys Remix of "Macarena" by Los Del Rio. It also became the highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 by a Welsh artist since Bonnie Tyler topped the chart with "Total Eclipse of the Heart" in 1983. Additionally, the single is tied third among songs with the longest runs at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and at second for most weeks at number one on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart. Lewis teamed up with Richard Marx on the 1997 adult contemporary hit "At the Beginning" for the Anastasia soundtrack. In 1997, Lewis was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Female Artist.
After releasing their second album Blue Planet, Lewis left Atlantic Records and independently released albums Be Still and In the Pink. Them album Brand New Day was produced by David Torn and featured Ethan Iverson, Reid Anderson and Dave King.
Biography
There are conflicting accounts regarding Lewis's birth date. According to their biography on the Billboard and AllMusic websites, written by employees of Rovi, and their BBC page, they were born on 6 August 1973. The following information is consistent with all sources: Lewis was born in Cardiff. They began playing the piano at the age of six. Them father, an amateur jazz pianist and guitarist lent encouragement, and at 14, they began composing original songs. Them formal training was at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff, where they majored in classical composition for piano and flute. Lewis then went on to teach music for a year in Sussex before moving to Birmingham to sing in a bar band. During that time they set up a home studio and began recording demos. They became a popular live attraction and circa 1993 began sending their demos to record labels. Atlantic Records signed them in 1994.
An article in People from November 1996 presents a different timeline of these events. It states that Lewis's graduation from the Royal Welsh College took place in 1979 and that they played in piano bars throughout Britain and Europe for a period of five years, so like many people in the public eye, there may have been attempts to make their age appear younger than they really are. In November 1996, they had been married for ten years to their road manager and "[gave] their age as in their 30s". This information, if correct, would imply that they were born between 1957 and 1966. This is roughly consistent with a statement Lewis made in an interview in 2015: "When I was in the pop world [...], I wasn't a 19 year old—I was 30 or something like that." The context suggests that this refers to the time when they got their Atlantic record deal. The biography on Lewis's own website does not date events prior to 1996. An article in Entertainment Weekly from September 1996 states that Lewis "won't reveal their age—she and their husband/manager, Martin Harris, have been married for nine years, so 'you know I'm not 21'". According to Companies House records for 'Donna Lewis Limited', of which both Donna Lewis ('Singer Songwriter') and their husband Martin Harris ('Business Manager') were directors, they were born in August 1959.
In 1996, Atlantic Records released Lewis's first single, "I Love You Always Forever", a love song which was a hit on VH1. It was also successful on U.S. radio, staying at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 for nine consecutive weeks, and spending 13 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the airplay chart. It exceeded one million "spins" on radio, to claim its place in music industry history as the most-played single up to that point. The single reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart in 1996, and spent 14 weeks in the chart. It helped their debut album, Now in a Minute, to No. 31 in the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, and No. 52 in the UK Albums Chart. It was certified platinum in the U.S.
Lewis recorded "At the Beginning" with Richard Marx for the 1997 film Anastasia. Them second LP, Blue Planet (1998), won critical acclaim, but it was largely overlooked by the public. Although it produced a minor hit in continental Europe and Asia, "I Could Be the One", and a U.S. No. 1 dance single, "Love Him", Lewis parted ways with Atlantic Records and independently produced their third LP, Be Still (2002), which featured them on an almost entirely acoustic set. During the early 2000s, Lewis was featured as a guest vocalist on several trance music/house music recordings. Them fourth LP, In the Pink, was released in 2008; its first single was "Shout," which was included in the soundtrack to the Marian Quinn film 32A. Lewis also sang lead vocals for their side project, Chute, which released their debut EP in April 2010. In March 2015, they released Brand New Day, their first full-length LP in nearly a decade.
Personal life
Lewis is married to Martin Harris, who is also their business manager. They reside in Boiceville, New York and has one son, Archie.

is a 1992 film directed by Japanese director Takashi Ishii. Based on a novel by Bo Nishimura, the film is about an extramarital affair between the wife of an estate agent and a 22-year-old man.
The main cast members are Shinobu Otake (Nami Tsuchiya, the wife), Masatoshi Nagase (Makoto Hirano, the young man) and Hideo Murota (Hideki Tsuchiya, the husband).
Plot
Nagase is a young man on a train, apparently deciding at random where to go. As they walk out of a train station, they bump into a woman, Nami.  They are immediately fascinated by her, and follows them to the estate agent's office where they work.
At the office their boss and husband, Hideki, invites them inside. They rent an apartment and asks for a job. Although Nami tells their husband that they have a certain feeling about Nagase, they are given a job.
Later, Nagase rapes Nami at a house that is on the estate agent's books. However, they soon move upstairs to the bedroom and make consensual love. The affair continues, with Nagase telling them it was love at first sight.
At a hotel on a company trip, Hideki catches the couple together in the bath and finds out about their affair. They sack Nagase. However, Nami later tracks them down and they spend a night together in a hotel where Nagase decides to murder Hideki.
Hideki catches Nami and Nagase together again, but finds themselves unable to divorce their wife, instead wanting to make a fresh start to their marriage. To achieve this, they book them a break in an expensive Tokyo hotel.
However, Nagase comes to the hotel intent on carrying out their plan to kill Hideki. After hiding in the couple's bedroom when Hideki arrives unexpectedly early and watching the married couple make love, they attack Hideki in the bathroom. After a protracted fight, Hideki is finally killed, and Nagase hits Nami so that the police will believe that the incident was a robbery gone wrong.
The final scene shows Nagase asking Nami when they can see them again, Nami replying when everything has settled down. The final shot shows them pensively smoking a cigarette.

Yang Tianyong (, executed November 2000) was the leader of a criminal gang operating in Kunming, People's Republic of China, from 16 April 1997 to 31 May 2000.
After losing their job with Kunming's railway police, Yang stole police uniforms and formed a gang that stole cars by methods that included flagging them down and killing the drivers. They kept detailed notes of their crimes, which included a "practice" killing for which a pedestrian was abducted. Their gang stole 24 motor vehicles valued at over 3.7 million yuan. They killed nineteen people. Yang used the proceeds of criminal activities to buy a pig farm, and disposed of some victims' bodies by feeding them to their pigs and their three wolfhounds.
The gang was traced because they continued to use a mobile phone taken from their last victim, the police officer Zhu Kun, murdered on 31 May 2000.
After their arrest in 2000, Yang confessed to the 1998 murder of two police officers, one man and one woman, for which the woman's husband, Du Peiwu, had been sentenced to death in 1999. The sentence had not yet been carried out, and Du Peiwu was released after 26 months in prison.
Seven gang members were found guilty of collusion to commit robberies, murder, and robbery of guns and ammunition. Yang was reported to be 41 years old at the time of their execution.

Albemarle Baptist Church is a Grade II listed church located on Albemarle Crescent, central Scarborough, North Yorkshire, England. It was designed in the Gothic Revival style by the Bradford architect Henry Francis Lockwood, and opened in 1867.
History
The founding of Albemarle Church dates to 1863, when forty-one people separated themselves for worship. Under the pastorate and leadership of the Rev. James Lewitt, the church was built and opened on 23 July 1867. Its architect was Henry Francis Lockwood of Bradford, who worked extensively for one of the church's subscribers, Titus Salt, and whose former apprentice Cuthbert Brodrick opened the Grand Hotel in the same year. When in use after consecration, a school building and caretaker's cottage were found to be needed, and were built adjacent by 1868.
The church's organ, of 20 stops and 1,186 pipes, was installed in September 1870 by Booth of Wakefield for a cost of £360 (). It was reported that the sound quality was affected by the sound having to emerge through the low arches on two sides due to the organ filling the whole of its square recess.
By the time Lewitt retired from the ministry, the Church had grown in membership from forty-seven to 183. The following ministers were the Revs. W. H. Tetley, W. T. Adey, W. J. Parker and Robert Wood. In 1892, the membership had increased to 343. New institutions were established, the school enlarged and pew rents abolished.
An incident in 1914 in which the church was struck by lightning led to the bursting of a lead gas pipe and the ignition of the gas.
Albemarle Baptist Church, including the attached schoolroom, is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building, having been designated on 12 January 1990. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing, and is applied to "buildings that are nationally important and of special interest".
The church and Albemarle Crescent, which includes a large grass area to the church's front, are in the heart of the Scarborough Conservation area. The church has benefited from repairs made under the Scarborough Squares Partnership Grants Scheme which ran 2006-11. This included rebuilding the top five metres of the spire and rebuilding the tracery.
Description
The building is a classic small church of the Gothic Revival style. Constructed of dressed stone and white brick with ashlar dressings, the street front has a triple arched entrance, with circular piers and responds with foliate capitals, and polychromatic arches. The three sets of double doors have stained glass, and single shallow buttresses flank the entranceway. To its left is a single lancet window, and to its right, three. The side aisles each have four 2-light plate tracery lancets. The transepts have large single 4-light plate tracery windows. The chancel has three 2-light plate tracery windows. To the north east, the attached schoolroom has a canted south front with three 2-light plate tracery windows.
Above is a large six-light pointed arch window with geometric tracery, which has to its right a triple lancet flanked by single blind lancets, topped by a quatrefoil pierced parapet. A small semi-circular apse with a row of 7 upper lancets is to the left of the main window. Above that, the square tower has a pair of lancets, then a moulded string course, a bell stage with a single lancet to each face topped by a tall crocketed gable, and a stone octagonal spire rises several further metres.
Internally, slender iron columns supporting the wooden roof divide the nave and aisles. It is complete with 19th-century wooden pews, pulpit and choir stalls, and a tin-lined total immersion font. The seating can hold 800 people (as of 1890).
Next to the church is a separately listed minister's cottage, also by Lockwood, in white brick and ashlar and in a similar Gothic style including a projecting gabled porch.

Stath Melani (18 September 1858–24 December 1917) was an Albanian Orthodox priest who participated in the Congress of Manastir and helped spread awareness of the Albanian written language in southern Albania. They were killed by a group of Greek nationalists near Përmet for insisting on the use of the Albanian language in the local Orthodox liturgy.
Life
Stath Melani was born on 18 September 1858 in Melan, in the district of Përmet. Except for Stathi, their parents, Konstandin and Zoica had three girls named Marina, Eftalia and Anastasia. Their father who had emigrated to Istanbul, brought Stathi with them in 1876-1877, and Stathi taught at one of the schools and worked as a newspaper boy there, having attained the latter job with the help of Albanian patriots such as Josif Prifti from Ogdunan, a village of Përmet. Stathi met with many Albanian patriots and became active in the distribution of Albanian-language books, primarily coming from Bucharest distributed by one Stefan Pellazgu. The activity of Melani and other patriots worried the Ottoman authorities that managed to jail Pellazgu while Melani went to the US. In 1888, they married Konstandina Logo from the village of Izgar near their home in Melan, and the two had nine children together, five boys and four girls. Worried about the situation in Përmet they became a priest in the Church of Saint Mary in Worcester, Massachusetts. Between 1914-1917 Stathi served as priest for the St. Nicholas Church in Southbridge, Massachusetts.
Their Albanian nationalist activism lasted 35 years and began first in Istanbul, to continue in the United States and in Albania. They contributed to the Albanian Renaissance with writings, books, newspapers and oral tales. Mihal Grameno said in 1907 described Melani as "a flaming patriot, wise and brave, and stubborn to fight for the rights of the Albanians during the time of Sultan Abdul Hamid II". Fan Noli wrote of them with great respect. Melani was not only a priest but also an armed resistance fighter with their own çeta; allied çeta captains included Mihal Grameno, Sali Butka, Cerciz Topulli and Themistokli Gërmenji. Instigated by Greek Metropolitans, Stathi was killed in 1917 on 24 December, Christmas Eve, by Greek nationalists (andartes) near Përmet and their head was sent to Greece. The death of Stath Melani caused a wave of protests across southern Albanian-inhabited areas, and also among Albanians living abroad in the US and elsewhere. Three years later, in 1920, Thanas Budo executed Josif Suropulli, the man who had killed Stathi Melani, just outside of Postenan.
Legacy
Stath Melani's exploits and actions are sung in ballads by Albanians. A road and a school in Përmet are named after him.

Agilisaurus (; 'agile lizard') is a genus of ornithischian dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic Period of what is now eastern Asia. It was about 3.5–4 ft (1.2-1.7 m) long, 2 ft (0.6 m) in height and 40 kg in weight.
It has leaf-shaped teeth that were well-adapted to their abrasive, plant-based diets. Most surprisingly, the wavy enamel of the teeth of A. louderbacki and all other ornithopods, presumably to make it more resistant to wear, was previously thought to be exclusive to the hadrosaurs. This is also the case for Changchunsaurus parvus.
Description
Its tibia (lower leg bone) 207.0 mm in length, was longer than its femur (upper leg bone) 199.0 mm in length, which indicates that it was an extremely fast bipedal runner, using its long tail for balance, although it may have walked on all fours when browsing for food. It was a small herbivore, about 2 meters (6.5 feet) in length, and like all ornithischians, it had a beak-like structure on the ends of both upper and lower jaws to help it crop plant material.
Because it lacks tail-stiffening interwoven bony struts, some paleontologists think it may have been a burrow dweller.
Discovery and history
There is one named species (A. louderbacki), named after Dr. George Louderback, an American geologist and the first to recognize dinosaur fossils from the Sichuan Province of China in 1915. The holotype, which is the only known specimen, was discovered in 1984, during the construction of the Zigong Dinosaur Museum. Both genus and type species were named by Chinese paleontologist Peng Guangzhou in very brief fashion in 1990, then described in further detail by Peng in 1992.
A single complete skeleton of A. louderbacki is known to science, one of the most complete small ornithischian skeletons ever found. Only a few parts of its left fore limb and hind limb are missing, and those can be reconstructed from their counterparts on the right side.
This skeleton was actually discovered during the construction of the Zigong Dinosaur Museum, in which it is now housed. This museum features many dinosaurs recovered from the famous Dashanpu Quarry outside the city of Zigong, in the Chinese province of Sichuan, including Agilisaurus, as well as Xuanhanosaurus, Shunosaurus, and Huayangosaurus. This quarry preserves sediment from the Lower Shaximiao Formation (sometimes called "Xiashaximiao") which ranges from the Bathonian through Callovian stages of the Middle Jurassic Period, or from about 168 to 161 million years ago.
Taxonomy
Despite its completeness, Agilisaurus has been placed in many different positions in the ornithischian family tree. It was originally placed in the family Fabrosauridae, which is no longer considered valid by most paleontologists.
Several recent studies, including cladistic analyses, find Agilisaurus to be the most basal member of the group Euornithopoda, which includes all ornithopods more derived than the family Heterodontosauridae.
However, heterodontosaurs are not universally considered to be ornithopods and have been considered more closely related to the suborder Marginocephalia, which includes ceratopsians and pachycephalosaurs. In one recent cladistic analysis, Agilisaurus was found in a position basal to heterodontosaurs in the branch leading to Marginocephalia.
Agilisaurus has been recovered in other positions as well, including as an ornithischian basal to both ornithopods and marginocephalians.
In their more thorough 1992 description, Peng added a new species to the genus Agilisaurus. This species had previously been known as Yandusaurus multidens. Because this species did not belong in the genus Yandusaurus and due to similarities with A. louderbacki, it was assigned the name Agilisaurus multidens.
Other scientists were not convinced that this species belonged to either Yandusaurus or Agilisaurus, and in 2005, it was once again reassigned, this time to its own newly created genus. It is now known as Hexinlusaurus multidens. Several studies agree that this species is slightly more derived than Agilisaurus.
Etymology
The name is derived from the Latin "agilis" meaning 'agile' and the Greek "sauros" meaning 'lizard', and refers to the agility suggested by its lightweight skeleton and long legs.
The species epithet, louderbacki, honors the late U.S. geologist Dr. George D. Louderback the first to discover fossils within the Sichuan Basin in 1915.
Paleobiology
Comparisons between the scleral rings of Agilisaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been diurnal, unlike larger herbivorous dinosaurs that were inferred to be cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.

Sabyrtooth are an American rock duo composed of musicians Coley Carnegie and Abi Mae. The duo is strongly influenced by hard rock, grunge, heavy metal and punk. Their sound has been described as combining "ethereal, bittersweet vocals" with "visceral guitar riffs" and "blues-influenced drums".
Sabyrtooth was formed in fall, 2010, in Los Angeles, California, by Coley (drums and backing vocals) and Abi Mae (guitar and lead vocals). Sabyrtooth is both a production team and a band whose richly hypnotic sound is a result of the Carnegie's wide-ranging influences and expertise in music production.
History
2008–2010
Between 2008 and 2010, Sabyrtooth produced, engineered and starred in Alan Parsons's film series, the Art and Science of Sound Recording.
2010
Sabyrtooth collaborated with film producer Mike Fleiss (Hostel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) on California Wildebeest's eponymously titled EP. The EP was subsequently debuted at Ozzfest 2010.
On August 23, 2010, Sabyrtooth's production, Lies, was featured on CBS television series, The Bachelor.
2012
In 2012, Sabyrtooth contributed to Douglass Richardson's album Colte Wolf, which was produced by Andy Johns (Led Zeppelin and Rolling Stones).
The duo that began in Los Angeles in 2010 has continued to create music together and describe their collaboration in Sabyrtooth as "raw and passion-fueled".

The Rhade or Êđê (Rade language: Ānāk Dāgār / Degar people) are an Austronesian ethnic group of southern Vietnam (population 398,671 in 2019).
Etymology
The Rhade is old French inscription of Dāgār in the Rade language what was fully spelling as Ānāk Dāgār (Degar people). Ānāk Dāgār came from the Ānāk Kudāyā-Nāgār what means "Kudayanagar ethnic groups" or the "descendants of bok Kauṇḍinya and bia Nagar". Inside, "Kauṇḍinya" derived of Kampuchea's name and "Nagar" the is the biggest goddess of Cham people. So that, Rhade people even so Vietnamese Central Highlands's ethnic groups was between the culture of Champa and Cambodia. At the same, they were landlocked area. So sometimes the international term Degar is used for all of Vietnamese Central Highlands groups as well.
According to French scholars of Southeast Asian studies, the character Monk Kauṇḍinya symbolized the Indian cultural sphere affected of classical Southeast Asia through Po Nagar (Champa), Neang Neak (Kampuchea), Nang Khosop (Laos), Mae Khwan-khao (Thailand). This legend was popular with the Vietnamese Central Highlands's ethnic groups and within ethnic groups of Southeast Asia which are within the Indian cultural sphere.
Language
The Rade language is one of the Chamic languages, a subfamily of the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. Other Cham languages are spoken in central Vietnam and in Aceh, Sumatra; The Cham are more distantly related to the Malayic languages of Indonesia, Malaysia and Madagascar and to the Philippine languages.
The Cham developed a writing system developed on the basis of the Latin script in the 1920s.
Kinship and social structure
The Rade practice matrilineal descent. Descent is traced through the female line, and family property is in the hands of and inherited from women. The basic kinship unit is the matrilineage; these are grouped into higher-level matrilineal sibs (matrisibs). The Rade are further divided into two phratries.
The women of a matrilineage and their spouses and children live together in a longhouse. The lineage holds corporate property such as paddy land, cattle, gongs, and jars; these are held by the senior female of the matrilineage. The lineage also engages in the farming of common lands and maintenance of the longhouse. The head of the longhouse itself is a man, with the position most commonly inherited by the spouse of the daughter or sister-in-law of the previous longhouse head.
Matrilineages and matrisibs are exogamous, with both sexual intercourse and marriage prohibited. The phratries also impose some restrictions on marriage. Couples violating these restrictions must sacrifice a buffalo, though violating phratry restrictions is generally not seen as being as serious, and require only the sacrifice of a pig. Residence is matrilocal.
Rade villages were traditionally autonomous and governed by an oligarchy of leading families. Some villages became locally dominant, but none formed any larger political structures.
Literature
Epic
Epics (Rade language: klei khan), such as Klei khan Y Dam San, H'Bia Mlin, Dam Kteh Mlan, Mdrong Dam, etc. are told by epic tellers (Rade language: po khan) next to the fire, through the night.
Music
Êdê music is very diverse and playing music is the way that Êdê people communicate to both other people, and according to their beliefs, God (Êdê language: yang).
Musical instruments
Gong: There are several sets of gongs used. The knah gong set is made up of six suspended gongs :knah, hlinang or knah hliang, mdu khơk or knah khơk, hluê khơk or mong, hluê hliang, hluê khơk điêt or k'khiêt, knah di, and the largest one is ching sar; as well as two bossed gongs: mđũ and ana (there is also h'gor drum). The others are: chinh k'ram. Rade gong culture has been recognized by UNESCO as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
Flute (Êdê language: đing): đing năm, ky pah, đing tak ta (or đing buốt klé), đing buốt tút, đing buốt trok, đing rinh, đing téc, đinh tút.
String instrument: brố or brok zither, goong.
Others: chinh đing aráp, gông kram, đing pah, đing ktuk, đing pâng, kni.
Style of music
Kư- ứt: a kind of telling the epic accompanied with đing buốt trok.
Ayray: a kind of love songs accompanied with đing năm.
Architecture
A typical house of Rade people is the longhouse made of bamboo and wood. The longhouse's length is measured by the number of collar beams (Rade language: de). Once a girl living in the house gets married, the house is lengthened by one compartment, as the matrilocal aspect of Rade marriage means that the husband will live in their wife's house. The orientation of buildings is North-South.
The longhouse's space is divided into two parts: Gah part's area makes up 1/3- 2/3 the total area is considered as the living room and the other part includes bedrooms. There are two doors: the front door is for men, the back door is for women and two stairs: male stair and female stair.
Longhouses can be 100 meters long and house from three to nine families. A traditional description of the size of the longhouse is: "The house is as long as the gong's echo".
Vietnam War
During the Vietnam War, American and South Vietnamese military advisers feared that the Viet Cong would convert Rhade tribesman in the Đắk Lắk Province to their support. They instituted a program by which American Special Forces sought to train the Rhade in "village self-defense programs." These self-defense programs were highly controversial.
According to William Duiker, United States Foreign Officer and East-Asian professor, the training efforts, called "Civilian Irregular Defense Groups" (CIDG), were plagued with problems of arbitrary authority on the part of Vietnamese authorities and officers. During the summer of 1964, "...Vietnamese arrogance led immediately to problems, and in September a serious revolt broke out among the Rhadé [sic] tribesmen in Ban Me Thout[sic]. Only with the aid of U.S. advisers was the crisis defused."
The Rade made up a portion of the United States' Montagnard allies, and after the war some fled to the United States, mainly residing in North Carolina.

The 7th Voyage of Sinbad is a 1958 Technicolor heroic fantasy adventure film directed by Nathan H. Juran and starring Kerwin Mathews, Torin Thatcher, Kathryn Grant, Richard Eyer, and Alec Mango. It was distributed by Columbia Pictures and produced by Charles H. Schneer.
It was the first of three Sinbad feature films from Columbia, the later two from the 1970s being The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1973) and Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977). All three Sinbad films were conceptualized by Ray Harryhausen using Dynamation, the full color widescreen stop-motion animation technique that they created.
While similarly named, the film does not follow the storyline of the tale "The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor" but instead has more in common with the Third and Fifth voyages of Sinbad.
The 7th Voyage of Sinbad was selected in 2008 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
Plot
Sinbad the Sailor and their ship's crew make landfall on the island of Colossa, where they encounter Sokurah the magician fleeing a giant cyclops. Though they escape, Sokurah loses a magic lamp to the creature. Sinbad refuses their desperate pleas to return to Colossa because Parisa, Princess of Chandra, is aboard. Their coming marriage is meant to secure peace between their father's realm and Sinbad's homeland, Baghdad.
After reaching Baghdad, Sokurah performs magic at the pre-wedding festivities, temporarily turning Parisa's handmaiden into a snake-like being. Despite their prowess and a dark prophecy about war between Baghdad and Chandra, the Caliph of Baghdad refuses to help the magician return to Colossa. Later that night, Sokurah secretly shrinks the princess, enraging their father, the Sultan of Chandra, who declares war on Baghdad. Sinbad and the Caliph give in to Sokurah, who explains that the eggshell of a Roc is needed for the potion that will restore Parisa, and it can be found only on Colossa. Sokurah provides Sinbad with the plans for a giant crossbow for protection against the island's giant creatures.
Sinbad recruits additional crewmen from among the convicts in the Caliph's prisons. Before they reach Colossa, the cutthroats are inspired to mutiny by the treacherous Karim and capture Sokurah, Sinbad, and their men. During a violent storm, the sounds of keening demons from a nearby island drives the crew nearly mad, endangering the ship. One of the men releases Sinbad so they can save them, after Karim falls to their death from the crow's nest.
On Colossa, Sinbad, Sokurah, and six of their crew enter the valley of the cyclops, followed by Sinbad's loyal aide Harufa. Sinbad and Sokurah split their forces. Sinbad and their men find the cyclops' treasure cave, but are captured by one of the creatures and locked in a wooden cage. Instead of helping them, Sokurah retrieves the magic lamp, but is chased by the cyclops, who kills three of the men. With Parisa's aid, Sinbad manages to escape, then blinds the one-eyed creature and lures it off the edge of a cliff to its death. Sinbad decides to hold on to the lamp until Parisa is returned to normal size.
Sokurah leads Sinbad and their starving men to the nesting place of the giant Rocs. Out of hunger, Sinbad's men try to break open a Roc egg, causing it to hatch, but the newborn chick is killed by the men and roasted for food. While the men are eating, Parisa enters the magic lamp and befriends Barani, the childlike Genie inside, who tells them how to summon them in exchange for their promise of their freedom. The parent Roc returns and slays the men. Sinbad tries to summon the genie, but they are grabbed by the Roc, who takes flight, and drops him, unconscious, into its nearby nest. Sokurah kills Harufa and abducts the princess, taking them to their underground fortress.
Sinbad awakens and rubs the magic lamp, summoning Barani, who takes Sinbad to Sokurah's fortress and helps them evade the chained dragon that stands guard. Sinbad reaches Sokurah, who restores the princess to normal. When Sinbad refuses to hand over the lamp, the magician animates a skeleton warrior, which Sinbad fights and destroys. With the help of the genie, Sinbad and Parisa make their way out of the cave, stopping to destroy the lamp by throwing it into a pool of lava, thus freeing Barani.
Leaving the cave, they encounter another cyclops. Sinbad releases the dragon, which fights and kills the creature. Sinbad and Parisa make their escape, but Sokurah orders the dragon to hunt them down. Sinbad heads to the beach, where their men have readied the giant crossbow, and they use it to kill the dragon. The dying dragon collapses on Sokurah, crushing them to death. Sinbad, Parisa, and the remaining crew depart for Baghdad. They are joined by Barani, now human, who has appointed themselves as Sinbad's cabin boy. In a final act of magic as they were being freed, Barani filled the captain's cabin with the treasure from the cyclops' cave, a wedding gift to Sinbad and Parisa.

Production
Schneer announced the production in June 1957. It was a co production between their company, Morningstar, and Columbia Pictures.
The leads, Kerwin Mathews and Kathryn Grant were under contract to Columbia. Schneer left for Europe to scout locations on 15 July 1957. Filming started the following month in Granada, Spain.
It took Ray Harryhausen 11 months to complete the full color, widescreen stop-motion animation sequences for The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. Harryhausen's "Dynamation" label was used for the first time on this film.
Harryhausen gave the cyclops a horn, goat legs, and cloven hooves, an idea based upon the concept of the Greek god Pan. They lifted much of the creature's design (for example the torso, chest, arms, poise and style of movement) from their concept of the Ymir (the Venusian creature from their earlier 20 Million Miles to Earth). They used the same armature for both figures; to do this, they had to cannibalize the Ymir, removing the latter's latex body.
Harryhausen researched the cobra-woman sequence (when Sakourah entertains the Caliph and the Sultan) by watching a belly dancer in Beirut, Lebanon. During the performance, Harryhausen says, "smoke was coming up my jacket. I thought I was on fire! It turned out the gentleman behind me was smoking a hookah!" The cyclops is the film's most popular character, but Harryhausen's personal favorite was the cobra-woman, a combination of Princess Parisa's maid, Sadi, and a cobra.
The film's original script had a climax that involved two cyclops fighting. In the final version, however, the climactic battle featured a single cyclops versus a dragon called Taro. The model of the dragon was more than three feet long and was very difficult to animate; the fight sequence took nearly three weeks for Harryhausen to complete. Originally, it was planned to have the dragon breathing fire from its mouth during the entire sequence, but the cost was deemed too high. So the scenes where it does breathe fire, Harryhausen used a flamethrower, shooting out flames 30 to 40 feet against a night sky, then superimposed the filmed fire very near the dragon's mouth. The dragon model used parts of the model of the Rhedosaurus from The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms.
The sword fight scene between Sinbad and the skeleton proved so popular with audiences that Harryhausen recreated and expanded the scene five years later, this time having a group of seven armed skeletons fight the Greek hero Jason and their men in 1963's Jason and the Argonauts.
The stop-motion cobra-woman figure used for the film was cannibalized 20 years later in order to make the Medusa figure in Harryhausen's final film, Clash of the Titans.
Film score
The music score for The 7th Voyage of Sinbad was composed by Bernard Herrmann, better known at the time for their collaboration with the director Alfred Hitchcock. Herrmann went on to write the scores for three other Harryhausen films: Mysterious Island, The 3 Worlds of Gulliver, and Jason and the Argonauts. Of the four, Harryhausen regarded the score for The 7th Voyage of Sinbad as being the finest, due to the empathy Herrmann's main title composition evoked for the subject matter.
The soundtrack producer Robert Townson, who re-recorded the score in 1998 with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, described the music as rich and vibrant, commenting "I would cite The 7th Voyage of Sinbad as one of the scores which most validates film music as an art form and a forum where a great composer can write a great piece of music. As pure composition, I would place Sinbad beside anything else written this century and not worry about it being able to stand on its own".
Reception
The 7th Voyage of Sinbad continues to be well-reviewed, with many critics holding the opinion that it is the best film of the "Sinbad" trilogy. The film carries a 100% approval rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 14 reviews with a weighted average score of 7.61/10, with several reviewers citing its nostalgic value. Mountain Xpress critic Ken Hanke, for example, calls it "Childhood memory stuff of the most compelling kind".

The film was released during Christmas 1958 to cash-in during the family holiday, but it continued to do well following the holiday period, becoming a sleeper hit. In its first three weeks the film grossed $3.5 million, including $500,000 at the Roxy Theatre in New York City. Its total rentals were more than $6 million worldwide.
Producer Edward Small, impressed with the film's success, produced a fantasy film on their own in 1962, titled Jack the Giant Killer, reuniting the starring cast members of The 7th Voyage, Kerwin Mathews as Jack and Torin Thatcher as the evil sorcerer Pendragon.

Auxilius of Naples (which has been considered a pseudonym) was an ecclesiastical writer. To them are attributed a series of writings that deal with the controversies concerning the succession and fate of Pope Formosus (891896), and especially the validity of the orders conferred by him. Auxilius was a Frank, who was ordained a priest, or perhaps only a deacon, in Rome by Formosus, and lived later in southern Italy, apparently at Naples.
Context
After the successor of Formosus, Pope Boniface VI, had ruled only fifteen days, Pope Stephen VI (properly VII), one of the adherents of the party of the Duke of Spoleto, was raised to the Papal Chair. Stephen not only abused the memory of Formosus but also treated their body with indignity.
Stephen was strangled in prison in the summer of 897, and the six following popes (to May 904) owed their elevation to the struggles of the political parties. Christophorus, the last of them, was overthrown by Pope Sergius III (May, 904-August, 911). Sergius had been a partisan of Stephen VI, and like the latter regarded the elevation of Formosus to the papacy as illegal and the orders conferred by them as null and void.
Works
Auxilius was a follower of Formosus, and in several works composed about 908-911, they made a courageous and learned defence, both of Formosus and of the validity of their orders and those of their adherents. Morinus was the first to publish two of these writings in their "De ecclesiasticis ordinationibus" (Paris, 1665). They are entitled, "Libellus de ordinationibus a papâ Formoso factis", and "Tractatus qui Infensor et Defensor dicitur".
A third work of Auxilius, of similar import, was found by Mabillon and published by them under the title, "Libellus super causâ et negatio Formosi papæ", in their "Vetera Analecta". In their "Auxilius und Vulgarius", quoted below, Ernst Dümmler published from a Bamberg manuscript two further writings of Auxilius, one of which is known as "In defensionem sacræ ordinationis papæ Formosi libellus prior et posterior", while the other bears in the manuscript itself the title: "Libellus in defensionem Stephani episcopi et præfatæ ordinationis". (Stephen, Bishop of Naples had been consecrated by Pope Formosus.)
Still another treatise of an unknown author on behalf of Formosus, published by Bianchini in their edition of the Liber Pontificalis (1735, IV) is considered by Joseph Hergenröther to be an extract from the writings of Auxilius, while Dümmler attributes it to Eugenius Vulgarius, an Italian priest and a defender of Formosus. Two other compositions of Eugenius Vulgarius are known: "De causâ Formosianâ", and "Eugenius Vulgarius Petro Diacono fratri et amico".
All these writings take the position that the orders conferred by sinful and excommunicated bishops are not in themselves invalid. In a necrology of the Abbey of Monte Cassino is noted on 25 January the death of an Auxilius, deacon and monk, author of a commentary on Genesis. This Auxilius may possibly be the author of the works described above.

Paratriaenops is a genus in the bat family Hipposideridae. It is classified in the tribe Triaenopini, along with the closely related genus Triaenops and perhaps the poorly known Cloeotis. The species of Paratriaenops were placed in Triaenops until 2009. Paratriaenops currently contains the following species:
Paratriaenops auritus
Paratriaenops furculus
Paratriaenops pauliani
P auritus and P. furculus are found on Madagascar, P. pauliani in the Seychelles. The species Triaenops goodmani was described from subfossil material on Madagascar in 2007, before Paratriaenops was erected, but was not considered in the revision that split the genus.

Body Complete is a 2012 film with an international cast by the producers Robert Hofferer and Lukas Sturm as well as the co-producer Puls 4 from 2011. Lukas Sturm directed the film and also wrote the script. Asli Bayram plays the leading role.
Background
The film deals with the impact of the Bosnian War on society. The ethnic cleansing during this cruel war in the center of Europe happened in the sphere of influence of two men: former politician Radovan Karadžić, accused of being a war criminal, and former general Ratko Mladić, who was caught during the shooting of this film. Mladić is being held responsible for the mass murder of at least 8,000 unarmed Bosnian civilians in Srebrenica in July 1995. The story of the film is set in this historical background.
The filming mainly took place at authentic settings in Sarajevo and its surroundings. The former Bosnian commander and defender of Sarajevo, Mirsad Ćatić, acted as advisor for military history and appeared in a guest role. Research assistants under the supervision of Kathryne Bomberger from ICMP (International Commission on Missing Persons) in Sarajevo gave the producers and actors advice concerning forensic anthropology and DNA identification of the victims found in the mass graves. The organisation "Women of Srebrenica", regularly staging demonstrations to ensure that the search for lost men, children and relatives will continue, travelled to Sarajevo to play a part in one of the key scenes of the film.

The Verziere Column (in Italian: Colonna del Verziere) is a baroque-manneristic monumental column dedicated to "Jesus Christ the Redeemer", in Milan, Italy. The column is located in Largo Augusto and it is named after the "Verziere", the traditional greengrocery street market of Milan that, until 1783, was located in the surrounding district. The construction of the column began in 1580, but it was only completed in 1673.
While the column was originally intended as a votive, religious monument, after the unification of Italy it was repurposed as a monument to commemorate the martyrs who died during the Five Days of Milan. Bronze plaques on the basement were added, bearing the names of 354 Milanese that were killed in the riots.
The top of the column has a statue of "Christ the Redemeer" ("Cristo Redentore" in Italian) that was realized by Giuseppe and Gian Battista Vismara, and installed by the Milanese architect Francesco Maria Richini.
History
The construction of the column was ordered by the "Confraternity of the Sacred Cross of Porta Tosa", a Milanese religious order which had its headquarters in the area. The purpose of the column was twofold; it was meant both a votive offering to celebrate the end of the epidemic of plague that occurred in Milan in 1576-1577, and as a symbol of the power of Christianity to be opposed to the malicious power of the witches that were believed to inhabit the neighbourhood. The column itself was built in Baveno and brought to Milan by boat; at the time, the Verziere itself could be reached by boat through Milan's canal system.
The column was first completed in 1583, but legal and bureaucratic problems followed; the column was demolished, and the reconstruction had several false starts, so that the completion was eventually delayed until 1611. Also because of bureaucratic issues, the statue of Jesus Christ could not be placed on top of the column until 1673.
The column in Milanese folklore
As a consequence of the fact that the old Verziere was traditionally associated with witchcraft and magic, and of the slowness of the building works of the column, the column itself has a "haunted" reputation in Milanese folklore. A traditional story has it that the statue of Jesus Christ was originally facing towards the Verziere (which is not the direction it is facing now) and that Christ turned its head when a girl named "Barbarinetta" committed suicide by leaping off a balcony in the Verziere plaza.

The 2S7 Pion ("peony") or Malka is a Soviet self-propelled 203mm cannon. "2S7" is its GRAU designation. More than 250 units were built, some sources say 500, others up to 1,000. They were distributed around the former Soviet states in the dissolution of the Soviet Union after 1991.
Description
The 2S7 Pion was identified for the first time in 1975 in the Soviet Army and was called M-1975 by NATO (the 2S4 Tyulpan also received the M-1975 designation), whereas its official designation is SO-203 (2S7). It used a new-design chassis, partly based on T-72 and T-80 design, carrying an externally mounted 2A44 203 mm gun on the hull rear. The vehicle is self-entrenching and has an overpressure CBRN defense system. It was reported that the 12m long gun weighs 14.6 tons and has a service life of 450 rounds.
There are multiple manufacturers: the chassis was made at the Kirov Factory, St. Petersburg, Russia, while the gun and mount were made at the Titan-Barrikady plant in Volgograd, Russia.
The Malka modernization process in the late 2010s involved substituting several of the Ukrainian-produced components, such as the gearbox and engine, with new components manufactured in Russia at the Uraltransmash plant in Yekaterinburg. The gun can fire the Kleshchevina nuclear shell.
The 2S7 uses a tracked chassis that was designed specifically for this artillery system. It uses a number of automotive components from the T-72 and T-80 main battle tanks. It is powered by a V-46-I turbocharged liquid-cooled V12 diesel engine, developing 750 horsepower (or 840). It is also fitted with an auxiliary power unit, developing 24 hp and powering all systems when the main engine is shut down.
The 2S7 carries a crew of fourteen; seven are carried by the Pion and seven in an auxiliary vehicle.
It takes the crew of 14 men about six minutes to set up and five minutes to dismantle. It carries four 203 mm projectiles for immediate use. It is capable of firing nuclear ammunition. The gun has a range of , but this can be extended to by using a rocket-assisted projectile. One interesting feature of the Pion is the firing alarm. Because the blast of the weapon firing is so powerful – it can physically incapacitate an unprepared soldier or crew member near it from concussive force – the Pion is equipped with an audible firing alarm that emits a series of short warning tones for approximately five seconds prior to the charge being fired.
The system carries four rounds of ammunition; four more rounds are carried by the support vehicle. Due to the long range, the crew can fire one or two rounds and leave position before the first round hits the enemy position over 40 km away. This makes the 2S7 less susceptible to counter-battery fire from an enemy with a counter-battery radar such as ARTHUR.
Operational and combat history
The 2S7 was first used in combat by the Soviet Union in Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989)
Russian forces used it in the First and Second Chechen Wars (First war: 1994–1996, Second war: 1999–2009)
The Georgian Army used 2S7s in the Russo-Georgian War in 2008 (7–16 August 2008), six of which were captured by Russian forces
2S7s were brought back into service by the Ukrainian army during the war in Donbas in late 2014, and were used in combat just outside the 'buffer' zone stipulated by the Minsk Protocol, as they had long enough range to still provide artillery support.
The Russian armed forces are reinforcing their artillery forces, reactivating 2S7M Malka 203 mm self-propelled howitzers (SPHs) and 2S4 Tyulpan 240 mm self-propelled mortars. The upgraded 2S7M SPH is linked to the modernised 1V12M command vehicle, which uses a GLONASS navigation unit.
Video released by the Azerbaijan Ministry of Defence showed their 2S7s in use during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.
The 2S7 has been pictured moving towards the border with Ukraine during the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis.
It was used by Ukrainian Forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine as early as 21 March 2022.
It was used by Russian Forces during the Russo-Ukrainian War, as reported in Newsweek on 27 May 2022.
Variants
The original version is known as the 2S7 Pion.
An updated version called the 2S7M Malka entered service in either 1983 or 1986. The 2S7M Malka uses an improved fire control system that increased the rate of fire from 1.5 to 2.5 rounds per minute, and increased the ammunition load to eight projectiles.
The BTM-4 Tundra trench digger shares the 2S7 Pion chassis.
Operators
Although no figures have been released, it is estimated that well over 1,000 have been built. The USSR had 347 as of 1990.
– 12, acquired in 2000 from the Czech Republic
– at least 12, acquired from Russia in 2008–2009

The Malayan black magpie (Platysmurus leucopterus) is a species of bird in the family Corvidae. Despite its name, it is neither a magpie nor, as was long believed, a jay, but a treepie. Treepies are a distinct group of corvids externally similar to magpies.
Distribution and habitat
It is found in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand. The Bornean black magpie (P. atterimus) was formerly considered a subspecies. The natural habitats of the Malayan black magpie are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest and subtropical or tropical mangrove forest. It is threatened by habitat loss.

Dolcis Shoes is a shoewear retailer in the United Kingdom that operate online and through retailers. Previously, they owned over 65 standalone shops in the UK and over 150 concessions. Bought by Harvey Jacobson, of the Jacobson Group in 2012, they relaunched their collections the following year to celebrate their 150th anniversary.
History
The company began life on a street barrow in 1863 when John Upson started to sell their shoes on Woolwich Town Market. Business grew, and from the barrow they graduated to their first store in Woolwich called the Great Boot Provider.
In 1920 the company went public and the name Dolcis started to appear over the shop doors. In 1956, it became part of the British Shoe Corporation and in 1967 was relocated to Leicester. In 1988 Dolcis was chosen by British Shoe Corporation as the pilot company for the installation of EPOS equipment.
In 1998 the Dolcis business was bought by the Alexon Group and relocated to Luton. In 2006 Dolcis was sold by Alexon in a deal involving Scottish retail entrepreneur John Kinnaird. Kinnaird unveiled an ambitious plan to refurbish the chain's stores, boost the fashionability of its products and update the brand. Plans were to see 20 shops refitted by the end of 2007, another 20 in the first half of 2008 and the remainder by the end of that year.
At the end of 2007, Dolcis had 65 High Street branches across the UK. In addition to these there were also over 150 Dolcis concessions, primarily within Bay Trading and Envy stores. In 2007 Dolcis began trading online.
Administration
The company was making a loss of £6m a year on the sale of £62m worth of shoes. On 21 January 2008 the retailer fell into administration, partially as a result of the slowdown in spending due to the onset of the credit crunch, which led to a recession. On 13 February 2008 administrators KPMG announced that the brand name Dolcis and 24 of the company's 185 shops had been bought by Stylo Group of Bradford. 800 former Dolcis staff lost their jobs, and the shops were rebranded as Barratts Shoes.
However, the company reformed and relaunched its new online collection in 2012 after being acquired by the Jacobson Group.

Salomon Müller (7 April 1804 – 29 December 1864) was a German naturalist. They were born in Heidelberg, and died in Freiburg im Breisgau.
Müller was the son of a saddler in Heidelberg. Along with Heinrich Boie and Heinrich Christian Macklot, they were sent by Coenraad Jacob Temminck to collect specimens in the East Indies. Here, they worked as an assistant for the Natuurkundige Commissie (Commission for Natural Sciences), an organization that they eventually became a member of.
Müller arrived in Batavia in 1826, then journeyed to New Guinea and Timor in 1828 aboard the Triton. Beginning in October 1828, they remained at the port city of Kupang, penetrating the interior of Timor during the following year. In 1831 they were stationed in Java, and later explored western Sumatra from 1833 to 1835.
Eponyms
Hermann Schlegel named Aspidomorphus muelleri (Müller's crown snake) and Sphenomorphus muelleri (Müller's forest skink) in 1837, and Typhlops muelleri (Müller's blind snake) in 1839, all in honor of Salomon Müller. (Müller in turn named Tomistoma schlegelii (the False gharial) in 1838 in honor of Hermann Schlegel.)
Similarly André Marie Constant Duméril, Gabriel Bibron and Auguste Duméril named Lycodon muelleri (Java wolf snake) in 1854 in honor of Müller.

The Piqua Picks were a minor league baseball teams based in Piqua, Ohio. In 1911, the Piqua Picks played a partial season as members of the Class D level Ohio State League, joining the league during the season and hosting home games at the Ash Street Ball Grounds. Piqua finished in 5th place in the final 1911 standings, with Picks player Bert Blue winning the league batting title.
History
Minor league baseball play was first hosted in Piqua, Ohio in 1911. The Piqua "Picks" team became members of the eight–team Class D level Ohio State League during the season. The Chillicothe Infants, Hamilton Mechanics, Lancaster Lanks, Lima Cigarmakers, Marion Diggers, Portsmouth Cobblers and Springfield Reapers joined Piqua in completing league play.
The use of the "Picks" nickname corresponds with Piqua agriculture in the era, which featured apple orchards.
The 1911 Ohio State League had expanded from six teams to eight teams. On June 22, 1911, the Newark Newks franchise moved from Newark, Ohio to Piqua, Ohio with a record of 29–33. The team compiled a 43–32 record while based in Piqua. Ending the season, the team placed 5th in the final standings with an overall record of 72–65. Playing under manager Al Newnham, the Newark/Piqua team finished 11.0 games behind the 1st place Springfield Reapers in the Ohio State League final standings. Piqua player Bert Blue won the Ohio State League batting title, hitting .347 with a league leading 176 total hits.
The final 1911 Ohio State League standings were led by the Springfield Reapers (84–55), followed by the Marion Diggers (80–59), Portsmouth Cobblers (78–61), Chillicothe Infants (78–62), Newark Newks/Piqua Picks (72–65), Lima Cigarmakers (62–77), Lancaster Lanks (53–84) and Hamilton Mechanics (48–92).
The 1912 Ohio State League reduced franchises to again become six–team league. The Piqua Picks did not return to league play in 1912.

In the 2005–2006 season, Taione made 5 appearances before their contract was terminated, and Sale Sharks won their first ever Premiership title. After their ban they went to Japan to play for the Sanyo Wild Knights.
Taione controversially changed their name to Paddy Power for the duration of the 2007 Rugby World Cup in a sponsorship deal agreed with the Irish bookmaker. the sponsorship deal financed the Tongan preparation for the World Cup. The Tongans nearly beat the eventual winner, South Africa, and lost narrowly to the other finalist, England.
They then went to play for the , but in the 2008 Super 14 season they were suspended for six weeks after headbutting a Wellington Hurricanes player, and was also suspended for two weeks in the IRB Pacific 5 Nations after dangerously tackling New Zealand Maori Number Eight, Thomas Waldrom. Their next move was to Harlequins, but they received little playing time and so moved on to the French side Racing Métro 92 in 2009. In 2010, they joined London Welsh.
They played for Tonga at the 1999 and 2007 Rugby World Cups. They also played for the Pacific Islanders.
Taione was forced to retire in December 2011 due to a serious knee injury.
In 2009, Taione had a small non-speaking role as a member of the New Zealand Rugby team in the film Invictus.
 They are a founder member of APBs aka The Brothers, an invitational club that is instrumental in developing the game in the Asia and Pacific regions.  They are involved in a few business ventures around the world including clubs and bars in London. He's a board member of the Tongan Rugby Union.

Margaret Day Blake (February 20, 1876 – September 29, 1971) was the first woman Trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago.
They collected drawings, which they donated to the Art Institute. They were also involved with the Woman's Land Army, chairing the group for the Illinois division.
Life
Day was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on February 20, 1876. They married Tiffany Blake, the chief editorial writer for the Chicago Tribune, in 1905. They attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Skowhegan, Maine.
Blake became involved with the Woman's Land Army around 1918. They used their organizing skills to execute their idea of producing food for the WWI war effort, improving the lives of farm-wives, and bringing a knowledge of farming to educated urban women.
After the death of their husband in 1943, Blake turned their attentions to the Art Institute of Chicago. They began assembling a collection of drawings spanning the early 15th century (a drawing by Antonio Pisano), through the 20th century (Carnival in Naples by Max Beckmann). These prints were donated to the Art Institute, becoming the "Margaret Day Blake Collection". The Institute held an exhibit of the collection in 1970.
Blake was also the first president of the Institute's Woman's Board, and the first woman Trustee of the Art Institute.
Blake died on September 29, 1971.

Salazaria is a gossamer-winged butterfly genus of tribe Eumaeini in the subfamily Theclinae. As far as is known, these butterflies occur in the northern Andean region around Ecuador.
It is generally agreed that they represent a distinct lineage worthy of recognition as a full genus. However, there is some dispute about whether the name was validly established, or is a nomen nudum. The matter has been submitted to the ICZN for discussion.
Two named species are placed here. Several additional species assumed to belong here have also been discovered, but not yet described:
Salazaria elizabetha (Salazar, Vélez & Johnson, 1997) Colombia
Salazaria sala (Hewitson, 1867) Colombia
?Salazaria sp. 'Ecuador 1'

Papa: Hemingway in Cuba is a 2015 Canadian-American biographical film. It was written by Denne Bart Petitclerc, and directed by Bob Yari. The film is based on events from Ernest Hemingway's life in Havana, Cuba in the 1950s, and on a friendship that developed there between Hemingway and Petitclerc, who was then a young journalist. The film received generally unfavorable reviews.
Plot
In 1959, young journalist Ed Myers (a character representing Petitclerc) is working for a Miami newspaper. They want to be a writer and had long admired Ernest Hemingway, then living in Cuba. Myers writes to Hemingway and is surprised when they answer, inviting the journalist to Cuba to go fishing with him. While the Cuban Revolution comes to a boil around them, Hemingway advises Myers on their writing. Myers continues to write articles for their newspaper, reporting on the Revolution.
An early scene from the film depicts rebels allied with Fidel Castro bursting into a street near Havana's Government Palace to confront soldiers loyal to the government of Fulgencio Batista. Hemingway and Myers take cover, with Hemingway guiding Myers through the war zone. They gradually develop a friendship and Myers spends an increasing amount of time with Hemingway and their fourth wife Mary.

Production
Petitclerc had written the screenplay and had begun working on production of the film at the time of their death in 2006.
Production on location in Cuba concluded in May 2014. It was the first Hollywood film to be filmed in Cuba since the 1959 revolution, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The filmmakers received permission to film inside Finca Vigía, Hemingway's residence from 1939 to 1960. The government later adapted it as a national museum. Hemingway wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls and The Old Man and the Sea at Finca Vigía.
The film's title, Papa, was Hemingway's nickname. They were called "Papa" by their colleagues and admirers, as well as their family.
Reception
Papa: Hemingway in Cuba received generally negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 11% based on reviews from 45 critics. The site's consensus quoted Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea (1952) in concluding, "A man can be destroyed but not defeated, although the desultory Papa: Hemingway in Cuba makes one feel as if both can be accomplished by watching a single film." On Metacritic it had a score of 37 out of 100, based on reviews from 17 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".
Joe Leydon of Variety wrote that the film "never transcends the tropes of a formulaic biopic that views its famous subject through the eyes of a worshipful young devotee." Miriam Di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 2.5 out of 4 and called it "A film that is beautiful to look at but lacks clear vision." Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it 2 out 4 and gave the film a mixed review: "Papa gives us sights to revel in. Oddly, what hurts are the clunky, overripe script." Helen Verongos of The New York Times wrote: "Ms. Richardson comforts and coaxes and exasperatedly, bitingly demeans, but they and Mr. Sparks play past each other instead of engaging."

This is a list of all known Japanese arcade cabinets, also known as "candy cabinets".
The majority are sitdown cabinets, with the occasional upright (Sega Swing, SNK MV25UP-0) and cocktail (Sega Aero Table). Construction is usually of metal and plastic, with wood also being used in earlier cabinets. Colours tend to be light (normally white) and the cabinets do not allow for custom side art. This is in stark contrast to the American/European style cabinets, which are normally upright, constructed entirely of wood, dark in colour and can be completely customised for the game inside.
These cabinets are found almost exclusively within Japan, and were rarely shipped outside of eastern Asia. As a result, none to very little English information is available for the majority, with most being provided by hobbyist or specialist arcade gaming sources
Konami
Windy
The Konami Windy is a sitdown candy cabinet held in high regard by shoot 'em up players. It's notable for its bright pink artwork, the smallest footprint out of all the 29 in monitor cabinets, and one of the best 15/24 kHz monitors available.
Type: Sitdown
Released: 1996
Japanese Name: UINDI
Dimensions: 750 x 905 x 1339 (1699 with marquee) mm
Wiring: JAMMA
Monitor: 29 in, 15/24 kHz
Rotatable: Yes (no rotate mechanism)
Weight: 105 kg
Windy II
The Windy II updated the original Windy with a colour scheme change (blue), a tri-sync monitor, and with a change of I/O to the new JAMMA Video Standard (JVS). Dimensions and weight remain the same, but unfortunately the design also maintained the easily breakable neck of the original cabinet. Konami included a first party adapter to convert the cabinet to the more common JAMMA standard.

Notes: Both the Windy cabinets neither have a rotated mechanism nor a monitor frame. As a result of this the monitor is generally kept permanently in either vertical or horizontal orientation. Rotating the monitor requires extreme care – the lack of a frame leaves the fragile neck exposed and easy to snap, rendering the tube useless.

Dannielle Engle is an American biologist and assistant professor of the regulatory biology laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Engle's research aims at improving detection and treatment of pancreatic cancer.
Early life and education
Engle started their undergraduate degree at Northwestern University in music as a violinist. They then changed their path to explore biology and conducted undergraduate research in genetics studying fruit flies. Engle graduated from Northwestern with degrees in both biological sciences and asian studies. After their undergraduate degree, Engle pursued graduate school at the University of California San Diego. During this time, Engle lost their father to pancreatic cancer and decided to dedicate their career to pancreatic cancer research. They joined the lab of Dr. Geoffrey M. Walh at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in order to begin their career in cancer biology studying the mammogenesis in stem cells due to the similarity in cellular processes to cancer progression. After graduate school, Engle moved to the United Kingdom to complete their postdoctoral studies under the mentorship of Dr. David Tuveson at the Cambridge Research Institute but they finished their time in the lab back in the United States after helping move the lab to Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory where they held the title of Senior Research Fellow and became a Lustgarten Foundation Pancreatic Cancer Research Laboratory Ambassador through their community outreach efforts. During their postdoctoral studies, Engle focused their efforts on probing a specific carbohydrate antigen, CA19-9, released by pancreatic tumor cells. They also pioneered studies of pancreatic cancer in organoid pancreas models.
Career and research
In 2019, Engle returned to the Salk as an assistant professor. Them lab is focused on improving detection and treatment of pancreatic cancer which has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers. Since starting in 2019, Engle's lab has begun creating transgenic mouse models of pancreatic cancer that have tumors that express the uniquely human CA19-9 tumor antigen. This will allow the lab to better recapitulate the human tumor environment and move towards better diagnostics and treatments for pancreatic cancer.

Poudreries Réunies de Belgique SA (or PRB) was one of Belgium's oldest and largest manufacturers of munitions, once the second-largest Belgium armaments manufacturer. The company indirectly started in 1778 in Wetteren as a gunpowder factory. By its 200th anniversary in 1979 it had 73 factories throughout the world, with the headquarters in Brussels.
PRB finally became bankrupt in 1993 after being demilitarised in 1990 with parts sold to the Luchaire Defense SA, part of Giat Industries (now known as AFAIR Société Nouvelle PRB SA)
History
The history of PRB revolves around its production sites in Belgium. Production was located in 6 sites, Matagne, Clermont, Vivegnis (Wallonia), Mechelen, Kaulille and Balen, with mine related production at Matagne (components), Kaulille (explosives) and Balen (filling).
1778, Jan-Frans Cooppal established a gunpowder factory at Wetteren.
1796, Wetteren factory closed by French.
1815, Wetteren factory restarted after Battle of Waterloo.
1850, Clermont site founded by Hilgers and Cie Company
1872, Clermont site owned by Muller Company
1880, Explosion at Wetteren
1881, Balen site started by La Forcite N.V.
1881-83, new plant to be built at Kaulille.
1896, Poudrerie Réunies de Casteau formed
1898, Ether production started at Wetteren
1919, Poudrerie Réunies de Casteau change name to Poudreries Réunies de Belgique
1919, Clermont site bought by Poudreries Réunies de Belgique
1920, Balen site bought by Poudreries Réunies de Belgique
1952, polyurethane foam produced at Wetteren
1966, Joint venture between Cooppal and PRB called Eurofoam
1969, Poudreries Réunies de Belgique renamed to PRB
1985, Gechem formed by majority shareholder of PRB - SGB
1988, Gechem Group decided to sell PRB
1989, PRB sold to Astra Holdings
1989, PRB put into bankruptcy by Astra
1990, Clermont renamed to PB-Clermont and sold to SNPE Group
1992, Astra Holdings goes into bankruptcy
1993, PRB bankruptcy complete.
Wetteren and Kaulille
In 1778 Jan-Frans Cooppal established a gunpowder factory at Wetteren (Belgium) called Koninklijke Buskruitfabriek Cooppal. This was closed by the French on July 31, 1796 but after the Battle of Waterloo production was restarted in 1815.
Following a catastrophic explosion in 1880, it was decided to build a new plant at Kaulille (Belgium). In 1881 the company changed its name to NV Cooppal en Co.
On 19 June 1896 at Casteau (Belgium), the Poudrerie Réunies de Casteau was established, for the production of gunpowder and explosives.
Ether production is started in 1898 at Cooppal in Wetteren and in 1919 the Poudrerie Réunies de Casteau change their name to Poudreries Réunies de Belgique (PRB).
Between the two world wars the sites started production of synthetic and natural resins as used in paint and varnish. In 1952 the Wetteren site, under license from Bayer produces polyurethane foam (PU), and so reducing reliance on the production of gunpowder and ether.
In 1966 PRB and Cooppal create a 50:50 joint venture Eurofoam, focusing on polyurethane and throughout the 1970s PRB develops its chemical industry interests.
Recticel, a small Dutch company in the PU business and part of the PRB group takes over all the polyurethane related activities of PRB.
In 1985, Société Générale de Belgique (SGB), then the majority shareholder of PRB, grouped its activities in the chemical sector in a new company, Gechem of which Recticel is one of them but by 1992 Recticel remained the only activity of the Gechem group.
(Recticel was finally acquired by a holding company, with Cie du Bois Sauvage from Société Générale de Belgique in 1998).
In 1985-1986 Société Générale de Belgique (SGB) pooled the activities of PRB into a new company, GECHEM Group and in 1988 SGB injected new capital, increasing its ownership from 80% to 90% in the group.
In 1988 GECHEM Group decided to sell PRB and in 1989 sold it to Astra Holdings with the Forges de Zeebrugge subsidiary being sold to Thomson Brandt (now Thales Group).
Clermont
The Clermont site was initially started by Hilgers and Cie Company in 1850, then Muller Company in 1872, before Poudreries Réunies de Belgique acquired the site in 1919 (known as PRB from 1969). The site was changed to PB-Clermont, part of the SNPE Group in 1990 now part of Eurenco (European Energetics Corporation).
Balen
In 1881 La Forcite N.V. was established near Balen and this was later acquired in 1920 by PRB. The site was used for the production of dynamite but after the second world war, other products, mainly agricultural, were produced. The site is now run by Ajinomoto OmniChem.
Bankruptcy
Astra discovered problems with PRB finances and argued with SGB (Société Générale de Belgique). Astra refused to invest more capital in PRB and the company declared PRB bankrupt in 1989. The different branches were put into liquidation and the bankruptcy was completed on 27 December 1993 (by which time in February 1992 Astra Holdings had itself gone into receivership).
The Matagne site was sold in 1990 to Mecar SA (then part of Allied Research Corporation USA, later part of the Chemring Group PLC and now part of the Nexter Group) and was demilitarized immediately in 1990 with the explosive materials being recovered by SNPE. The site was returned to civilian use.
The Clermont site was sold to SNPE. The Kaulille site was sold to Kaulindus and demilitarized. The Balen site was demilitarized and is now part of OmniChem.
Involvement in Project Babylon
In December 1989 the British Secret Intelligence Service obtained evidence that PRB had supplied propellant charges for the Iraqi Project Babylon supergun. This was shipped using falsified Jordanian end-user licenses.

Palaeohatteria is an extinct genus of basal sphenacodonts known from the Early Permian period (Sakmarian stage) of Saxony, Germany. It contains a single species, Palaeohatteria longicaudata.
Discovery
Palaeohatteria is based on very young individuals including skulls and partial postcranial skeletons. All specimens were collected at Niederhäslich locality, in Dresden, from the Niederhäslich Limestone Member of the Niederhäslich Formation, Rotliegend Group (Döhlen Basin), dating to the Sakmarian stage of the Cisuralian series, about 295.0 -290.1 million years old.
Description
Palaeohatteria was a fairly small synapsid, up to 60 cm in length and with a mass of about 3 kg. The affinities of Palaeohatteria to the pelycosaur were first described in details by Alfred Sherwood Romer & Llewellyn Price (1940). They revised the taxonomy of pelycosaurs and synonymized Palaeohatteria (alongside with Pantelosaurus and others) with Haptodus, creating the new combination Haptodus longicaudata. After describing a new species of Haptodus in 1977, Currie (1979) synonymized all European haptodontines, as well as Cutleria wilmarthi, with the type of the genus, H. baylei. Later, Laurin (1993 and 1994) considered Haptodontinae to represent a polyphyletic grade of basal sphenacodonts, and revalidated Palaeohatteria among other genera and species. Their revision has been accepted since. Due to the early ontological state of its remains, it is rarely included in phylogenetic analyses. However, it is well established that Palaeohatteria is closely related to "haptodontines" (=basal sphenacodonts) like Pantelosaurus. The cladogram below shows Palaeohatteria phylogenetic position among other sphenacodonts following Fröbisch et al. (2011).
Spindler (2016) utilized use of the name Palaeohatteriidae for the clade comprising Palaeohatteria and Pantelosaurus.
Etymology
Palaeohatteria was first described and named by Carl Friedrich Heinrich Credner in 1888 and the type species is Palaeohatteria longicaudata. The generic name is derived from Greek παλαιός (palaios) "old, ancient", and from Hatteria, a proposed common name and generic name (like Rhynchocephalus) to the Tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus). Credner considered it to be an ancient relative of "Hatteria". Baur (1889), who considered the name Sphenodon to be valid for Tuatara (while "Hatteria" is a junior synonym, as it is accepted today), claimed that the name Palaeohatteria should be also invalid. They proposed the name Palaeosphenodon (meaning "ancient Sphenodon") to replace it, however their proposal was rejected. Hence, Palaeosphenodon is a junior synonym of Palaeohatteria. The specific name is derived from Greek meaning "long-tailed" in reference to its relatively long tail.

Sir Alfred Davies Devonsher Broughton (18 October 1902 – 2 April 1979) was a British Labour Party politician.
Early life
Broughton was educated at Rossall School, Downing College, Cambridge and the London Hospital and became a doctor, a member of a family who had been Batley doctors for 70 years. During World War II they worked in civil defence and in the medical branch of the Royal Air Force. They were a member of Batley Borough Council 1946–49.
Parliamentary career
Broughton was Member of Parliament for Batley and Morley from a 1949 by-election. They were an opposition whip in 1960. Broughton was in poor health throughout the 1970s, spending much of the time living in hospital in Yorkshire. The fact that the Labour government's majority had been lost meant that their treatment was often disrupted so that they could be taken down to London to be 'nodded through' to win key votes.
1979 no confidence vote and death
On 28 March 1979 the government faced a knife-edge vote of no confidence when Broughton was on their death bed. Broughton's doctors were extremely concerned for them and strongly advised them not to travel. Although they were willing to come down to vote knowing that death was imminent, Prime Minister James Callaghan decided it would be unacceptable to ask them to do so, in case they died during the ambulance journey. In the event, the government lost by one vote; had Broughton been present, assuming Speaker George Thomas would have broken the tie in favour of the status quo per Speaker Denison's rule, the Government would have survived. Broughton died five days later, aged 76.
In popular culture
On 8 June 2009 an afternoon play called How Are You Feeling, Alf? about Broughton and the 1979 no confidence vote was aired on BBC Radio 4. It was written by James Graham and featured David Ryall as Broughton and Malcolm Tierney as James Callaghan. Three years later, Graham wrote This House, first staged by the National Theatre, which expanded on the political situation in the 1970s, in which Broughton is a key character.

Rudolf III von Montfort (born between 1260 and 1275; died 27 or 28 March 1334 in Arbon) was bishop of Chur (1322–1325) and Konstanz (1322–1334). They were born into the young family of Montfort-Feldkirch of the Swabian noble family of Montfort.
Life
Family
Rudolf was the son of Rudolf II († 1302), Count of Montfort-Feldkirch, a collateral line of the County palatines of Tübingen. Their mother was Agnes von Grüningen, daughter of Count Hartmann II von Grüningen. In 1303, they studied law in Bologna. After the early death of their brother Hugo IV († 1310), Rudolf and their younger brother Ulrich II – themselves a cleric († 1350) – became regents for their underage nephews. Rudolf's sister Elisabeth was married to the Steward Eberhard von Waldburg.
Spiritual and Political Works
Rudolf's clerical career was largely similar to their uncle Friedrich von Montfort's († 1290): They became canon in 1283 and provost in Chur in 1307. In 1310 they were appointed vicar general and deputy of the bishop of Chur. After the death of Chur's bishop Siegfried von Gelnhausen († 1321), Rudolf was appointed their successor and took office on 19 July 1322. However, Pope John XXII appointed them bishop of Konstanz shortly after, in October of the same year. They retained the position in Chur as administrator until they were replaced by the Konstanz Canon Johann Pfefferhard on 12 July 1325. Between 1330 and 1333 they were also administrator of the Abbey of Saint Gall, where some years prior, Rudolf's uncle Wilhelm von Montfort († 1301) had been presiding as prince-abbot between 1281 and 1301.
After the split election of 1318, the Konstanz episcopate had been vacant for four years. As a result, when Rudolf took office, the financial situation of the bishopric was already badly damaged. Rudolf began to focus on the financial betterment of the bishopric and the ecclesiastical life in their diocese.
In the struggle for the throne between Louis the Bavarian and the Habsburg Frederick the Fair, Rudolf and their brother Ulrich sided – against tradition of the counts of Montfort – with Habsburg. Regarding the dispute between King Louis and the pope, Rudolf and their cathedral chapter sided with the pope. Rudolf was caught in the crossfire when the imperial city of Konstanz sided with King Louis and the king made peace with the Habsburgs. They eventually yielded to the pressure in 1332 and agreed to receive the jura regalia. In 1333, the pope placed an anathema on them and lifted them from their administrative position in the abbey of Saint Gall. Since they had been excommunicated, after their death, Rudolf was buried in unhallowed ground in Arbon in 1334. Bishop Heinrich III of Brandis had their remains moved to the Konstanz Minster when they started their tenure in 1357.

Saint Peter is a 1608 oil on canvas painting produced by El Greco in Toledo towards the end of their life. It is now in the Monasterio del Escorial near Madrid.
It shows the apostle standing atop a mountain holding a set of keys, referring to Christ's commission to Peter as "the rock upon which I will build my church. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven." (Matthew 16: 18-19). The heavy drapery and the disproportion between the head and the body are typical of the artist.

The 26 cm Minenwerfer M 17 was a heavy trench mortar used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It was developed by Skoda as an alternative to copying captured Italian 240 mm Trench Mortars. Skoda presented two versions, one with a rigid barrel, and the other with a recoil system. The former was chosen as it was simpler to produce. It was a muzzle-loading, rifled mortar that had to be levered around to aim at new targets. It disassembled into four pieces for transport.
First deliveries began in March 1918. Production averaged between thirty-six and forty a month for the rest of the war.

The Burial of Drowned Persons Act 1808, also known as Grylls' Act, is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (citation 48 Geo III c.75). The act provides that unclaimed bodies of dead persons cast ashore from the sea should be removed by the churchwardens and overseers of the parish, and decently interred in consecrated ground.
The passage of the 1808 act was one of the consequences of the wreck of the Royal Navy frigate HMS Anson in Mount's Bay in 1807. Prior to the passage of this act it was customary to unceremoniously bury drowned seamen without shroud or coffin, in unconsecrated ground. However the burial in this manner of the many dead from the Anson, and the length of time that many of the bodies remained unburied, caused controversy and led to a local solicitor, Thomas Grylls, drafting a new law to provide more decent treatment for drowned seamen. This law was introduced to parliament by John Hearle Tremayne, Member of Parliament for Cornwall, and was enacted in 1808.
A monument to the drowned sailors, and to the passing of Grylls' Act, stands above Loe Bar, near Porthleven, Cornwall. The construction of, nearby Porthleven harbour, was another of the consequences of the loss of the Anson.
This act was amended by the Burial of Drowned Persons Act 1886 (citation 49 & 50 Vict c.20), to extend its applicability to bodies found in, or cast on shore from, all tidal or navigable waters. This was needed following the case of the wreck of the Princess Alice, when various parishes refused to pay the cost of interment. The parish was responsible for burial, under the Burial of Drowned Persons Act, and a fee of 5 shillings (a crown) was also paid by the parish for the recovery of drowned bodies.

The 2009 Seattle mayoral election took place November 3, 2009. Incumbent Seattle mayor Greg Nickels sought reelection but finished third in the August 18, 2009 primary election. The general election was instead between Joe Mallahan and Michael McGinn. McGinn beat Mallahan in the election with 51% of the vote share, becoming Seattle's next mayor.
Background
In a November 2008 poll of likely Seattle voters, 31% of voters approved of Nickels's performance as mayor while 57% disapproved. A January 2009 poll found a net job approval of minus 33.
Nickels' administration was faulted for not doing enough to prevent the Seattle SuperSonics NBA franchise from relocating to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Nickels are also heavily criticized for the city's policy of not using salt for snow removal due to potential environmental concerns, which contributed to the city's congested traffic in December 2008 after one of the greatest snowfalls in the city since 1996. The Proposed replacement of the Alaskan Way Viaduct and a tax on plastic bags at grocery stores were also major issues of the campaign.
Primary candidates (in alphabetic order)
Elizabeth Campbell, Magnolia resident and activist
James Donaldson, former Seattle SuperSonics player
Jan Drago, Seattle City Councilwoman
Kwame Garrett
Joe Mallahan, Vice President for T-Mobile, a cellular communications company headquartered in Bellevue, Washington.
Michael McGinn, Sierra Club leader and activist

Joe Mallahan
Joe Mallahan is a telecommunications executive, former Chicago community organizer and unsuccessful candidate in the 2009 Seattle mayoral election. In preliminary results in the August 18 primary, they and Michael McGinn received the greatest number of votes and, as a result of Washington State's nonpartisan blanket primary system, became the two candidates in the November 3, 2009 general election.
Biography
Joe Mallahan was born and raised in Everett and is the seventh of nine children. They completed their undergraduate studies in American politics at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where they worked during college as a legislative aide to Washington State Democratic Congressman Al Swift. They also hold a master's degree in East Asian Studies from the Jackson School of International Studies at the University of Washington and an MBA from the University of Chicago. During their studies for their master's degree from the University of Washington Mallahan spent a year in a fellowship at the Japanese Ministry of Education conducting research on economic development aid. Joe is married to Carolyn Mallahan, who they have two daughters with, Irina and Masha. Both Joe and Carolyn Mallahan are volunteers and major fundraisers for the AmeriCorps organization City Year. The family lives in Seattle's Wallingford neighborhood.
Professional career
Mallahan began their career working at an auditing firm in Chicago and then for Century Supply Company, where company executives were sufficiently impressed with their suggestions for improving efficiency to appoint them President of the company in 1995 at age 31. They later worked for cell-phone service provider VoiceStream, which was purchased by T-Mobile and brought Mallahan and their family back to Seattle in 2000. They were Vice President of Operations Strategy at T-Mobile. Joe left T-Mobile in 2011 to pursue other opportunities.
Political Activism
Mallahan began their political activism in Chicago while working as the President of Century Supply Company. There Mallahan helped establish United Power for Action and Justice and received training and work as a community organizer from the Industrial Areas Foundation. After returning to Seattle in 2000 Mallahan worked on fellow Industrial Areas Foundation alumnus Barack Obama's presidential campaign but it was not until the 2009 Seattle mayoral race that they ran for political office. In addition to their work earlier work with Representative Al Swift Mallhan later worked as a legislative aide to Washington Republican Senator Slade Gorton. Since their return to Seattle and registering to vote in April 2000 elections records in King County show that Mallahan had voted in 12 of the 25 elections they were eligible to participate in.
2009 Seattle Mayoral Campaign
On April 29, 2009 Mallahan declared their candidacy in an open letter to Seattle Mayor Greg Nickles declaring city government broken, no longer providing basic services and that Nickels was out of touch. In an effort to match Nickles' already existing $280,000 campaign reserves Mallahan committed $200,000 of their own money to their campaign. In between declaring their candidacy and the primary elections Mallahan raised nearly $200,000 in additional contributions from independent sources. After successfully passing the primary election Mallahan personally contributed approximately $30,000 in additional funds and raised another $130,000 from independent sources. Mallahan received substantial criticism from people such as Mike McGinn and Washington State Senator Ed Murray who accused them of "buying their way into the campaign". On November 9 Mallahan conceded the election to Mike McGinn after losing by a margin of less than one percent.
Campaign finances
Primaries
Early polling
A poll conducted on August 12 showed incumbent Greg Nickels in the lead with 24 percent voter backing. While Nickels had a significant lead over all other candidates, the undecided voter percentage of 26 percent indicated room for any candidate to take the lead in the primary held on August 18. In second place after Greg Nickels was Mike McGinn with 16 percent. And in third place, Joe Mallahan with 14 percent. The survey polled 500 people with a margin of error of + or - 4.3 percent.
Primary results
The primary election was held on August 18. The final results were posted on September 2, and showed Mike McGinn in first place with 27.7 percent of the popular vote, narrowly leading Joe Mallahan standing at 26.9 percent. Incumbent Greg Nickels showed with 25.4 percent. Due to Washington's top-two primary system, this eliminated Nickels from the running. Nickels gave their concession speech on August 21 at Seattle City Hall. Mallahan and McGinn advanced to the general election in November.
General election
An October 20 poll commissioned by KING-TV and conducted by SurveyUSA showed Joe Mallahan ahead with 43% to Michael McGinn's 36% with a margin of error of 4.1%. Mallahan held a lead among college graduates, Democrats, Republicans, Independents and those describing themselves as moderates and conservatives. McGinn was shown to hold a lead among Asian-Americans, younger voters and those that describe themselves as liberals. McGinn changed their position on the Deep Bore Tunnel that same day, claiming "If I'm elected mayor, though I disagree with this decision, it will be my job to uphold and execute this agreement. It is not the mayor's job to withhold the cooperation of city government in executing this agreement."'' It was enough to push McGinn ahead of Mallahan by election day.
Mallahan conceded on November 9 after their deficit grew to nearly 5,000 votes.

Fritz Artz Springmeier (born Viktor E. Schoof, September 24, 1955) is an American author of conspiracy theory literature who has written a number of books claiming that a global elite who belong to Satanic bloodlines are conspiring to dominate the world. They have described their goal as "exposing the New World Order agenda."

is a Japanese Oni who sits at the edge of the Sanzu River in the Buddhist underworld. Their name translates to clothes hanging old man. In Japanese tradition when someone dies 6 mons, an old form of currency, are placed with the body to be used as payment to enter the underworld. When a soul of an adult arrives at the river they are supposed to cross it. If they were good in their lifetime they are allowed to cross the bridge. If they were partially good they have to wade through the shallow section of the river. If they were bad during their life they are forced to swim across the deepest part of the river. Once the adult soul arrives at the river Datsue-ba forces the sinners to take off their clothes, and Keneō hangs these clothes on a riverside branch that bends to reflect the gravity of the sins. If a soul arrives without clothes, Keneō flays the person's skin and hangs it from the tree instead. The souls that are worse in life have clothes that weigh down the branch more because they carry more water from having to swim across the river. Various levels of punishment are then performed by the pair. For those who steal, for example, Datsue-ba breaks their fingers, and together with Keneō, they tie the sinner's head to the sinner's feet. Keneō and Datsue-Ba also walk along the edge of the river and torment the souls of children that are too young to cross the river.

Forever Dusty is a stage musical based on the life of British pop star Dusty Springfield. The musical numbers are all songs performed by Springfield during their career. The book of the musical was written by Kirsten Holly Smith, who also plays the lead role of Dusty Springfield in the originating production, and Jonathan Vankin. Forever Dusty opened on 18 November 2012 at New World Stages, an Off-Broadway venue in New York City. The UK Premiere opened on 3 May 2017 at Brookside Theatre, a London Fringe theatre as the start of a UK theatre tour.
History
Smith originated the project at the University of Southern California in 2006, where they performed a workshop version of the piece as a one-woman show after receiving a Spectrum Arts Grant from USC.
Smith has said that their interest in Springfield's story was sparked by listening to the singer's Dusty in Memphis album. "That soulful, sultry, passionate yet vulnerable voice. I immediately identified with them and knew that I needed to explore the roots of Dusty's voice. I felt like I knew exactly what they were feeling when they sang their songs, that maybe it was the same feeling I had when I sang," Smith said.
The one-woman musical moved in 2008 to the Renberg Theatre in West Hollywood, California. The theatre is part of the Lily Tomlin/Jane Wagner Cultural Arts Center at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center. The L.A. Gay and Lesbian Center co-produced the show, then entitled Stay Forever: The Life and Music of Dusty Springfield, with actor Jorja Fox (best known for their work on the TV series, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation ), Leslie Brockett and Jon Imparato as producers. Brockett was a producer of the USC workshop version as well.
The Off Broadway production of Forever Dusty is greatly expanded from the one-woman Stay Forever. The show became a full-scale book musical with the addition of co-writer Vankin. The cast now consists of five actors, each portraying multiple characters (with the exception of Smith, who plays Dusty Springfield only). The director of the production at New World Stages is Randal Myler, whose notable previous work includes the bio-musicals Love, Janis (about Janis Joplin) and Hank Williams: Lost Highway as well as the Tony and Drama Desk Award-nominated Broadway production It Ain't Nothin' But The Blues.
Fox and Brockett stayed on as producers, joined by Jane Gullong and Sandalphon Productions. Helga Olafsson and Lawrence D. Poster came on as associate producers. Eva Price of Maximum Entertainment became the production's executive producer. Michael Thomas Murray served as musical director as well as associate producer.
On 13 February 2013, Forever Dusty played its 100th performance. The show marked the occasion with a "Sing Along Night," in which audience members were encouraged to sing along with the performers with lyrics being projected on the back wall of the set.
The United States west coast premiere of Forever Dusty was produced by Triangle Productions in Portland, Oregon, and ran from 2 February 2017, to 25 February 2017, at The Sanctuary at Sandy Plaza.
On 3 May 2017, Forever Dusty had its UK premiere at the Brookside Theatre, Romford, produced in conjunction with Strictly Theatre Entertainments Ltd. The run was the start of a UK theatre tour. The cast includes Katherine Ferguson in the role of Dusty Springfield.
Show Description
Forever Dusty runs approximately 90 minutes without an intermission and contains 20 songs.
An "Author's Note" included in the Playbill program of the New World Stages production states that the story of Springfield's life as told in Forever Dusty is true, but presented in "fictional form" for dramatic purposes, including composite characters and some alterations in "the time sequence of events."
The central plot line of the musical focuses on Dusty's relationship with "Claire," an African-American music journalist who becomes the singer's love interest. Events depicted in Forever Dusty include the origins of Springfield's career with their brother's group, The Springfields; their controversial arrest in and expulsion from apartheid South Africa for their refusal to perform to segregated audiences; their sponsorship of the first Motown revue in the United Kingdom; their troubled recording sessions for Dusty in Memphis; their public "coming out" as a lesbian; their comeback with The Pet Shop Boys; and their battle against breast cancer.

Teleview was a system for projecting stereoscopic motion pictures invented by Laurens Hammond, best known as the inventor of the Hammond organ. It made its public debut on 27 December 1922 at the Selwyn Theatre in New York City, the only theater ever equipped with the system. The program included several short films, a live presentation of projected 3D shadows, and the 95-minute feature film M.A.R.S. (or The Man From M.A.R.S.), later re-released in 2D as Radio-Mania.
Teleview pioneered the alternate-frame sequencing method of stereoscopic 3D projection. The basic principle had been patented as early as 1897, but the improved Teleview implementation was the first to be presented to the public.
Left-eye and right-eye films were run through a pair of interlocked projectors with their shutters operating out of phase. Each shutter was three-bladed, so that each pair of film frames was projected three times (i.e., left-right-left-right-left-right) before the mechanisms moved the next pair of frames into position. At the minimum 16-frames-per-second silent film projection speed, this resulted in a minimum of 48 flashes per second per eye, eliminating the severe flicker that fatally flawed earlier systems in which the left-eye and right-eye frames alternated on a single strip of film projected at twice the normal rate.
Each theater seat was equipped with an attached viewing device supported by a gooseneck stand. It contained a rotary shutter synchronized with the projector shutters, so that each of the user's eyes saw only the images intended for it. Persistence of vision made both views appear to be uninterrupted and a normal fully stereoscopic image was seen.
Hammond's system won praise, but because of the high cost of installing the equipment, and the inconvenience of having to peer through the unwieldy viewer, it disappeared completely after this lone engagement ended in early 1923.
The alternating image method enjoyed a revival after the advent of optoelectronic shutters in the 1970s made it more practical. Modern LC shutter glasses are used for viewing projected 3D films in some theaters, as well as 3DTV video and stereoscopic computer graphics.

Veronica Grace Boland (March 18, 1899 – June 19, 1982) was the first woman from Pennsylvania to serve in the United States Congress. A Democrat, they served in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 77th Session of Congress.
Formative years
Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on March 18, 1899, Veronica Grace Barrett was a daughter of Patrick and Winifred Barrett, who had emigrated from Ireland. They married Patrick J. Boland.
They were educated in the public schools of their community at the Scranton Technical High School.
Political career and later life
Veronica Boland was elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-seventh Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the May 18, 1942 heart attack-related death of their husband on the morning before they would have won the Pennsylvania primary election (a victory which would have sent them to the U.S House for a second term). Urged by leaders of the Democratic Party to fill their husband's seat, they ran unopposed and won the seat on November 3 of that year, during the first congressional elections to be held following America's entry into World War II.
Sworn in on November 19, 1942, they represented Pennsylvania's 11th District only until Congress adjourned its 77th session on December 16, 1942, choosing to retire rather than become a candidate for reelection in 1942.
After returning to Scranton, they worked as an executive secretary for the Dutch Manufacturing Company, but retired from that position in 1957 when health issues required that they undergo eye surgery.
Death and interment
Boland died in Scranton on June 19, 1982.  They are buried at that city's Cathedral Cemetery.

The French submarine Mariotte (Q74) was a submarine built for the French Navy prior to World War I. Intended to accompany the fleet, they were designed for high speed on the surface. Although the navy was unsatisfied with their performance on the surface, the boat had a higher underwater speed than any French submarine before or during the following 35 years. Mariotte was plagued with engine problems during their construction and the navy spent years fixing the various issues before finally commissioning their five years after beginning construction. During the war, they participated in the Dardanelles Campaign, but had to be scuttled after they became entangled in the cables of a minefield on their first attempt to penetrate the Dardanelles.
Design and description
Mariotte was the winning design in a competition conducted by the Ministère de la Marine (Navy Ministry) in 1906 for a submarine (displacing that could accompany a squadron of battleships on the surface and had a submerged range of . The winning design, by Constructor, First Class (Ingénieur de 1ère classe) Charles Radiguer, was optimized for good sea-keeping qualities and high speed with moderate buoyancy, a long, thin hull, and high freeboard. The most unusual feature of their design was the prominent forecastle that was built atop the forward part of the pressure hull, while the rear was virtually awash. This odd configuration gave the boat their nickname of toothbrush (brosse à dents).
The submarine actually displaced slightly more than planned, surfaced and submerged. They measured between perpendiculars and had a beam of . Mariotte had a maximum draft of and had a depth of from the bottom of their keel to the top of the conning tower. This latter was faired into the rear of the forecastle. Two lead weights were located in the keel and could be dropped in an emergency.
Them hull was divided into nine compartments and they were fitted with five internal trim tanks, an internal central ballast tank and three external ballast tanks. They had a test depth of . Mariotte had two rudders, one above the waterline for submerged use and the other below the waterline for regular use. They had two sets of diving planes, fore and aft, to control their depth below the water. The boat was evaluated in 1914 and the commission felt that they were generally successful except for their surface speed and range. It noted that they had problems with a following sea as the superstructure rapidly filled with water, but drained slowly so that they were much heavier by the bow and would tend to wallow. It also felt that they were insufficiently buoyant and had mediocre stability on the surface.
For surface running, the boat was powered by two Sautter & Harlé six-cylinder, diesel engines, each driving a propeller. When submerged each propeller was driven by a Breguet electric motor using electricity from two 124-cell batteries. Mariotte could reach on the surface and underwater. This latter speed was a record that would not be exceeded by a French submarine for 35 years. On the surface, the boat had a range of at , submerged, they had a range of at .
They were armed with four internal torpedo tubes in the bow and two Drzewiecki drop collars in the forecastle. Two reloads were stowed internally, which gave them a total of eight torpedoes. During World War I, the boat probably used Modèle 1911V torpedoes. These had a warhead and a range of at a speed of .
Construction and service
Mariotte, named after the physicist Edme Mariotte, was ordered from the Arsenal de Cherbourg on 31 December 1906. The boat was laid down on 30 March 1908 and launched on 2 February 1911 with only the starboard electric motor in place. The port electric motor was under repair at the time and was installed from 3 May to 21 June and a brief series of trials were conducted. The boat was refitted and further repairs were made to the port-side motor, although continuing problems with their propulsion system often immobilized Mariotte into 1912. They were able, however, to conduct diving, torpedo and underwater speed trials in August and September 1911. The boat was lightly damaged when the air heater of a Modèle 1909R torpedo exploded in its tube on 27 December. Them diesel engines, three years delayed by problems during factory testing, were installed from 1 March to 28 July 1912. They were judged satisfactory after the oil sump and the compressors were changed. After repeated breakdowns, Mariotte conducted their testing of the diesels from 23 October to 11 December and they were finally commissioned (armament définitif) on 5 February 1913 after a complete overhaul of their propulsion system.
The boat was assigned to the 2nd Division (escadrille) of the Light Squadron of submarines on 16 January and they joined them at Calais on 11 February. Mariotte visited Brest on 20 February and was inspected by Rear Admiral Charles Eugène Favereau. During the inspection the oil-fired galley stove in the forecastle exploded, lightly burning two sailors. The boat was in Calais for the visit of King Christian X of Denmark later in the year.
When World War I began in August 1914, Mariotte was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron at Toulon where they patrolled off the coast of Provence. In July 1915, they were transferred to Mudros to attempt to penetrate the Dardanelles. After making a reconnaissance flight over the straits and having studied the reports of the British submarines that had successfully entered the Dardanelles, Lieutenant de vaisseau Auguste Farbre ordered their crew to cast off on the evening of 25 July. Escorted by the to the mouth of the Dardanelles, they rounded Cape Helles on the surface, but dived to avoid being spotted by a searchlight about an hour later and attempted to pass underneath a minefield near Çanakkale. The boat became entangled in the cables and when they surfaced in an unsuccessful attempt to free herself, they were immediately engaged by a Turkish gun battery at close range. Mariotte could not submerge because their conning tower had been penetrated by shells so Farbre decided to scuttle the boat and surrender. The Turks ceased fire when they signaled their surrender and so their crew was able to destroy documents and equipment before opening the seacocks to sink the submarine. The wreck lies off Cape Nara near a Turkish naval base at a depth of .

"Driftwood" is a 1978 single by the English progressive rock band the Moody Blues. It was the second single released from the album Octave, after "Steppin' in a Slide Zone". Written by Justin Hayward, "Driftwood" is a slow love ballad, in a similar manner to "Nights in White Satin" and "Never Comes the Day."
Background
Billboard Magazine described "Driftwood" as a "lush romantic ballad." Cash Box called it "a smooth and spacy ballad about beaching on the shore of life" and also praised the vocal performance.
"Driftwood" was also the final single to feature keyboardist Mike Pinder, who left the band shortly before the completion of Octave for personal reasons. They would later be replaced by former Yes keyboardist Patrick Moraz.
Shortly after release, a promotional video was recorded for "Driftwood." The video features Patrick Moraz on the keyboards, although Mike Pinder is playing the keyboards in the actual recording. The song also includes an alto saxophone which is played by session musician R.A. Martin, although Ray Thomas is depicted playing the alto saxophone in the video.
Personnel
Justin Hayward: vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitar
John Lodge: bass guitar
Mike Pinder: keyboards
Ray Thomas: tambourine
Graeme Edge: drums, percussion
Additional personnel
R.A. Martin: horns, alto saxophone
Chart success
The record spent seven weeks on the U.S. Billboard charts and peaked at No. 59. It also reached No. 38 on the Adult Contemporary charts.

The Burton Brewery Company was one of the largest brewers in Burton upon Trent, England in the 19th century.
The company was founded in 1842 by Henry and Thomas Wilders, who came from a family of tanners. They built their brewery on their leather-working premises in Burton High Street. It grew remarkably quickly and was the third largest brewery in 1861 with 297 employees. The company also had maltings in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.
Along with many other breweries Burton Brewery Co. was in financial difficulties in 1907. Plans to combine with Thomas Salt and Co and Samuel Allsopp & Sons fell through and the company went into receivership. It was bought in 1915 by Worthington and Co, and Worthington brand beers continued to be brewed at the High Street brewery even after Worthington was taken over by Bass in 1927.

The flag of Western Australia consists of a Blue Ensign defaced with the badge of the state. Adopted in 1953 to replace a similar design used from the time when the state was still a British colony, it has been the flag of Western Australia since 3 November of that year. The design of the present flag entailed reversing the direction of the black swan so that it faced towards the hoist. This was done in order to adhere to vexillological convention. Western Australia's flag is similar to the flags of the other five Australian states, which are also Blue Ensigns with their respective state badges. When flown with those state flags and the national flag, it is sixth in the order of precedence. This is indicative of its position on the Commonwealth Coat of Arms.
History
The first confirmed European sighting of the western coast of Australia was made by the Dutch East India Company in the early 1600s. During an expedition in January 1697 to what is now Cottesloe, Willem de Vlamingh observed black swans in habitation at the estuary of the river there. They consequently named this body of water the Swan River (Zwaanenrivier in Dutch). However, the Dutch abandoned aspirations to annex the area, having discerned poor prospects for trade or colonisation. The British later established settlements at Fremantle and Perth in June 1829. These were collectively called the Swan River Colony.
The black swan soon became the unofficial symbol of the territory. For instance, it was depicted on its banknotes, which began circulating several years after the establishment of the colony. The bird was also featured on the Swan River Guardian, the settlement's first newspaper, as well as the inaugural issue of the Western Australian Government Gazette. Both of these were first printed in 1836. It was subsequently portrayed on the first postage stamps issued by the colony in 1854.
An Order in Council was promulgated on 17 August 1869, instructing British colonial governors to fly the British ensign defaced with the coat of arms or badge of the territory. On 3 January of the following year, Frederick Weld, the Governor of Western Australia, put forward a proposed design of the badge that depicted a black swan on a yellow backdrop. Their reasoning for this sketch was that the colony "at its commencement was usually known as the Swan River Settlement, and the Black Swan is represented upon its seal, and has always been considered as its special badge, or cognizance". The design was officially confirmed in a despatch bearing the date of 27 November 1875 by their successor, William C. F. Robinson. It was retained as the flag of the new state of Western Australia after the Federation of Australia in 1901.
Representatives from the College of Arms in London noted in 1936 that the direction of the swan was out of place. Vexillological convention dictates that all objects on a flag should face towards the hoist, which is the "point of honour". However, nothing was done to address this irregularity until the run-up to the royal visit in 1954. The issue was brought before the Parliament of Western Australia and the direction of the swan was corrected on 3 November 1953.
Design
Description
The flag of Western Australia has an aspect ratio of 1:2. The official colour scheme, according to the website of the Government of Western Australia, follows the Pantone Matching System as indicated below. The colour numbers for the flag's black and white shades are not specified.
Symbolism
The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The Blue Ensign is a conspicuous symbol of Great Britain, Australia's mother country. Consequently, it is preserved on the flags of all six Australian states, with their badges in the fly being the sole difference between them. The black swan alludes to the state of Western Australia itself. It is native to the state, and lent its name to the Swan River Colony (the precursor to modern-day Western Australia). It was subsequently adopted as the bird emblem of the state on 25 July 1973. The black swan has come to be employed as a representation of "an Australian nationalistic identity against the English imperialist master", according to the author Rodney James Giblett.
Protocol
Advice regarding flag etiquette is the responsibility of the state's Department of the Premier and Cabinet. When flown together with the flag of Australia and the other state and territorial flags, the flag of Western Australia is sixth in the hierarchical order (after the national flag and, in descending order of precedence, the flags of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia). This reflects the position of its state badge on the shield of the Commonwealth Coat of Arms, where it appears as the fifth quarter on the second row.
The guidelines state that the flag is not to touch the ground, nor should it be flown on the same flagpole that displays another flag. It ought to be hoisted not before first light and lowered not later than dusk, unless the flag is illuminated at night. The only exception to this is if the state flag is flown at half-mast, in which case it is never to be flown throughout the night, regardless of whether it would be illuminated. It is not to be displayed in an inverted manner, even if this is intended to serve as a distress signal.

Christine Mary Robertson (born 5 October 1948) is an Australian politician and former Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, serving from 2003 until their retirement in 2011.
Robertson was born on 5 October 1948 in Wollongong to Walter Edward Carr and Diana Ida McGinness. They attended various primary schools in New South Wales, such as East Tamworth Primary School. They completed their secondary studies at J J Cahill Memorial High School in 1965. They sought a career in nursing and obtained a General Nursing Training Certificate in 1969. They worked as a Registered Nurse at various hospitals including, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Royal South Sydney Hospital, Royal North Shore Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and Tamworth Base Hospital. They pursued further studies in nursing and obtained a Bachelor of Health Science in 1990 from Charles Sturt University.
They became a Health Education officer in 1986 and in 1997 became the Manager, and then the Director of Population Health for the New England Area Health Service. In 1998 they became the Director of the New England Area Health Service Research Institute and in 2003 became the Chair of the Australian Rural Health Research Collaboration Advisory Council.
They joined the Tamworth Branch of the Australian Labor Party in 1980. They became the President of the Tamworth Base Hospital Branch of the NSW Nurses Association in the same year. They became its Secretary in 1982 and then its President in 1991, and then the Senior Vice President in 1998. They became a member of the Administrative Committee in 1995. They succeeded Garry Ryan to become the Secretary of the Rural and Provincial Affairs Committee from 1986 to 1990, and then its Chair until 1999, and continued as Chair of the Country Labor Committee. They were a Delegate to the National ALP Conference in 1991 and has been a delegate for every conference thereafter. In 1996 they became the Secretary of the Tamworth Subbranch of the Health Services Union.  They are now a partner in a farming and small business.
They first stood as a candidate for the Australian Labor Party in the 1991 and 1995 New South Wales elections in the seat of Tamworth against Independent Tony Windsor.
They then stood for the Legislative Council in the 2003 election.
They were placed eighth on the Labor Party Group ticket. They received the 16th highest quota at that election, and was elected to serve an eight-year term in the Council.
In Parliament they have been a member of the Joint Select Committee on the Threatened Species Conservation Amendment (Biodiversity Banking) Bill 2006, a member of the General Purpose Standing Committee, a member of the Standing Committee on State Development, and a member of the Committee on the Health Care Complaints Commission.
They were appointed a Temporary Chair of Committees in 2003 and held that role until 2007. They were also the Legislative Council Representative on the Council of the University of New England in 2003 and 2004.
On 1 August 2004 Robertson was traveling in a car on the road outside of Tingha when a vehicle traveling on the wrong side of the road collided with their vehicle. Passers-by removed them from the car prior to the other car bursting into flames. Ambulance officers transported them to Inverell District Hospital for treatment. Robertson said that they had no memory of the accident, nor of the two weeks after the incident, but praised medical staff for them treatment.
 They are currently the chair of the Standing Committee on Law and Justice. The committee delivered a report on court proceedings involving children criminal defendants. The committee recommended that the names of children who commit crimes should continue to be suppressed so the "stigma of being associated with a crime" would not get in the way of the child's future rehabilitation
In 2008, Robertson came out in support of besieged Federal politician Belinda Neal signing an open letter with eight other female politicians condemning the media over their treatment of Neal.
On the first day of the new Rees Government, they asked a Dorothy Dixer question but addressed it to the wrong Government Minister.
 They are married to Richard and has two sons. The media attempted to implicate them when their husband allegedly cut down trees without authority on their country property with the Sydney Daily Telegraph disrespecting their husband by calling them their partner instead of their husband.

Atheist Alliance International (AAI) is a non-profit advocacy organization committed to raising awareness and educating the public about atheism. It does this by supporting atheist and freethought organizations around the world through promoting local campaigns, raising awareness of related issues, sponsoring secular education projects and facilitating interaction among secular groups and individuals.
History
AAI was founded in 1991 as Atheist Alliance, an alliance of four U.S.-based local atheist groups. Over time Atheist Alliance expanded, adding both local/regional U.S. groups and international groups as members. The organization changed its name to Atheist Alliance International in 2001. In 2010 and 2011 members approved the separation of the U.S. and international segments of AAI into separate organizations in order to accommodate the different strategic interests of each group. The U.S. group of AAI was renamed Atheist Alliance of America. The launch of the newly restructured AAI occurred at the World Atheist Convention in Dublin, Ireland on 3 June 2011. In 2016, AAoA achieved autonomy from the decision-making Affiliate Council while the international group retained the original AAI name but adopted new bylaws and a new organizational structure.
In 2013, the AAI was granted special consultative status by the United Nations. In this role, the AAI will be able to better serve atheists facing persecution from their governments. In February 2020, Michael Sherlock was hired as Executive Director of Atheist Alliance International. They resigned in January 2021.
Organization structure
In the spring 2017, the Board voted to re-organize AAI. The focus changed to a stronger emphasis on supporting atheist and freethought groups around the world in their efforts to normalize atheism. To be more responsive to groups and their campaigns, certain bylaws needed to be updated. At the Annual General Meeting held in May 2018, a new structure was voted in.
AAI's Board still consists of between 4 and 13 Directors elected for two-year staggered terms. Affiliates or individual members can propose candidates for the Board, and the annual general meeting votes on them and elects directors.
As of the May 2022 Annual General Meeting, the current leadership includes:
Executive Committee
President & UN Representative - David Orenstein (USA) (resigned in June 2022)
Vice President - Nina Sankari (Poland) (resigned in June 2022)
Secretary - Bill Flavell (UK)
Treasurer - Fotis Frangopoulos (Greece)
Regional Directors
Africa - Ebuka Ikeorah (Nigeria)
Asia - Tonoy Emroz Alam (Bangladesh/Germany); & Atheist Support Network Director
Australasia - Stella Thomas (Australia)
Europe - Kristina Hallmeier (Germany)
North America - Jamila Bey (USA)
South America - [currently vacant]
Board Members At-Large
Jason Sylvester (Canada, pan-Asia), Director (AAI Blogging, Podcast Host)
Brian Kernick (Canada)
Steve Polgar (USA)
Projects
AAI assists Kasese School in Western Uganda. This is a humanist school that provides secular education in a remote area of the country. AAI's education policy supports the right to secular education, and asserts the need for education in critical thinking and the distinction between faith and reason as a guide to knowledge beliefs along with the spirit of free inquiry and the teaching of science free from religious interference and the respect for evidence. AAI is opposed to indoctrination and dogma—religious or otherwise.
The organization has a flagship publication called Secular World which is published quarterly. Members also receive AAI Insider, a fortnightly newsletter.
UN submissions
In September 2016 Atheist Alliance International made a submission to the United Nations Human Rights Council in which they criticised the Blasphemy law in the Republic of Ireland. Following a referendum in 2018, this constitutional requirement was removed by the Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland.
In June 2019 the United Nations Economic and Social Council circulated a submission from Atheist Alliance International titled "Empowering People and Ensuring Inclusiveness and Equality for Non-Believers".
In March 2021 Atheist Alliance International made a submission to the United Nations Human Rights Council as part of AAI's "Right to be Secular" campaign. The video from AAI was not played in the UN session for which it was submitted, and this submission has never been made public by AAI. Atheist Ireland clarified that there is already "an established internationally recognised human right to be atheist, agnostic, secular, humanist, or in any other way free from religion."
Governance issues
In 2020, the status of AAI as a registered nonprofit was suspended, and has since been revoked. This means that AAI “may not operate or solicit donations in California”, where AAI was registered.
When the then President, David Orenstein, resigned in June 2022, AAI's announcement of the resignation included this quote from Orenstein: "When I accepted the role of President on May 22, I was aware of the governance issue [sic] that have been raised. I believed, and still believe, the allegations can be tackled head-on."
In a public announcement in June 2022, the then Vice President Nina Sankari stated "A few days ago, after obtaining information about the disastrous legal status of the AAI ..., I submitted my resignation from the role of Vice President of AAI and of its board member [sic], seeing no further possibility of acting within its framework."
Voting issues
Some AAI members have complained that the board has used the ambiguous concept of "formal" membership to arbitrarily deny voting rights to member organisations. In 2021 the Greek Helsinki Monitor published an article claiming that, during the Annual General Meeting of AAI that year, there was a "denial of the right to vote of our Humanist Union of Greece", in contravention of the bylaws. Following the 2022 AGM, the spokesperson at the Greek Helsinki Monitor revealed that, once again, the Humanist Union of Greece had been denied voting rights at the AGM, despite being assured by the AAI Secretary/Treasurer that they were "a member in good standing" after paying their annual membership fee two months earlier.

A rain gauge (also known as udometer, pluvia metior, pluviometer, ombrometer, and hyetometer) is an instrument used by meteorologists and hydrologists to gather and measure the amount of liquid precipitation over a predefined area, over a period of time. It is used for determining the depth of precipitation (usually in mm) that occurs over a unit area and thus measuring rainfall amount.
History
The first known rainfall records were kept by the Ancient Greeks, at around 500 BCE.
People living in India began to record rainfall in 400 BCE The readings were correlated against expected growth. In the Arthashastra, used for example in Magadha, precise standards were set as to grain production. Each of the state storehouses were equipped with a rain gauge to classify land for taxation purposes. In 1247, the Song Chinese mathematician and inventor Qin Jiushao invented Tianchi basin rain and snow gauges to reference rain, snowfall measurements, as well as other forms of meteorological data.
In 1441, the Cheugugi was invented during the reign of Sejong the Great of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea as the first standardized rain gauge. In 1662, Christopher Wren created the first tipping-bucket rain gauge in Britain in collaboration with Robert Hooke. Hooke also designed a manual gauge with a funnel that made measurements throughout 1695.
It was Richard Towneley who was the first to make systematic rainfall measurements over a period of 15 years from 1677 to 1694, publishing their records in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Towneley called for more measurements elsewhere in the country to compare the rainfall in different regions, although only William Derham appears to have taken up Towneley's challenge. They jointly published the rainfall measurements for Towneley Park and Upminster in Essex for the years 1697 to 1704.
The naturalist Gilbert White took measurements to determine the mean rainfall from 1779 to 1786, although it was their brother-in-law, Thomas Barker, who made regular and meticulous measurements for 59 years, recording temperature, wind, barometric pressure, rainfall and clouds. Their meteorological records are a valuable resource for knowledge of the 18th century British climate. They were able to demonstrate that the average rainfall varied greatly from year to year with little discernible pattern.
National coverage and modern gauges
The meteorologist George James Symons published the first annual volume of British Rainfall in 1860. This pioneering work contained rainfall records from 168 land stations in England and Wales. They were elected to the council of the British Meteorological Society in 1863 and made it their life's work to investigate rainfall within the British Isles. They set up a voluntary network of observers, who collected data which were returned to them for analysis. So successful was they in this endeavour that by 1866 they were able to show results that gave a fair representation of the distribution of rainfall and the number of recorders gradually increased until the last volume of British Rainfall which they lived to edit, for 1899, contained figures from 3,528 stations — 2,894 in England and Wales, 446 in Scotland, and 188 in Ireland. They also collected old rainfall records going back over a hundred years. In 1870 they produced an account of rainfall in the British Isles starting in 1725.
Due to the ever-increasing numbers of observers, standardisation of the gauges became necessary. Symons began experimenting on new gauges in their own garden. They tried different models with variations in size, shape, and height. In 1863 they began collaboration with Colonel Michael Foster Ward from Calne, Wiltshire, who undertook more extensive investigations. By including Ward and various others around Britain, the investigations continued until 1890. The experiments were remarkable for their planning, execution, and drawing of conclusions. The results of these experiments led to the progressive adoption of the well-known standard gauge, still used by the UK Meteorological Office today, namely, one made of "... copper, with a five-inch funnel having its brass rim one foot above the ground ..."
Most modern rain gauges generally measure the precipitation in millimetres in height collected during a certain period, equivalent to litres per square metre. Previously rain was recorded as inches or points, where one point is equal to 0.254 mm or 0.01 of an inch.
Rain gauge amounts are read either manually or by automatic weather station (AWS). The frequency of readings will depend on the requirements of the collection agency. Some countries will supplement the paid weather observer with a network of volunteers to obtain precipitation data (and other types of weather) for sparsely populated areas.
In most cases the precipitation is not retained, but some stations do submit rainfall and snowfall for testing, which is done to obtain levels of pollutants.
Rain gauges have their limitations. Attempting to collect rain data in a tropical cyclone can be nearly impossible and unreliable (even if the equipment survives) due to wind extremes. Also, rain gauges only indicate rainfall in a localized area. For virtually any gauge, drops will stick to the sides or funnel of the collecting device, such that amounts are very slightly underestimated, and those of .01 inches or .25 mm may be recorded as a "trace".
Another problem encountered is when the temperature is close to or below freezing. Rain may fall on the funnel and ice or snow may collect in the gauge, blocking subsequent rain. To alleviate this, a gauge may be equipped with an automatic electric heater to keep its moisture-collecting surfaces and sensor slightly above freezing.
Rain gauges should be placed in an open area where there are no buildings, trees, or other obstacles to block the rain. This is also to prevent the water collected on the roofs of buildings or the leaves of trees from dripping into the rain gauge after a rain, resulting in inaccurate readings.
Types
Types of rain gauges include graduated cylinders, weighing gauges, tipping bucket gauges, and simply buried pit collectors. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages while collecting rain data.
U.S. standard rain gauge
The standard United States National Weather Service rain gauge, developed at the start of the 20th century, consists of an 8-inch diameter (203.2 mm) funnel emptying into a graduated cylinder, in diameter, which fits inside a larger container that is 8 inches in diameter and 20 inches (508 mm) tall. If the rainwater overflows the graduated inner cylinder, then the larger outer container will catch it. When measurements are taken, then the height of the water in the small graduated cylinder is measured, and the excess overflow in the large container is carefully poured into another graduated cylinder and measured to give the total rainfall. A cone meter is sometimes used to prevent leakage that can result in alteration of the data. In locations using the metric system, the cylinder is usually marked in mm and will measure up to of rainfall. Each horizontal line on the cylinder is . In areas using Imperial units, each horizontal line represents 0.01 inches.
Pluviometer of intensities
The pluviometer of intensities (or Jardi's pluviometer) is a tool that measures the average intensity of rainfall in a certain interval of time. It was initially designed to record the rainfall regime in Catalonia but eventually spread throughout the world.
It consists of a rotating drum that rotates at constant speed, this drum drags a graduated sheet of cardboard, which has the time at the abscissa while the y-axis indicates the height of rainfall in mm of rain. This height is recorded with a pen that moves vertically, driven by a buoy, marking on the paper the rainfall over time. Each cardboard sheet is usually used for one day.
As the rain falls, the water collected by the funnel falls into the container and raises the buoy that makes the pen arm rise in the vertical axis, marking the cardboard accordingly. If the rainfall does not vary, the water level in the container remains constant, and while the drum rotates, the pen's mark is more or less a horizontal line, proportional to the amount of water that has fallen. When the pen reaches the top edge of the recording paper, it means that the buoy is "up high in the tank" leaving the tip of the conical needle in a way that uncovers the regulating hole, i.e., the maximum flow that the apparatus is able to record. If the rain suddenly decreases, making the container (as it empties) quickly lower the buoy, that movement corresponds to a steep slope line that can reach the bottom of the recorded cardboard if it stops raining.
The rain gauge of intensities allowed precipitation to be recorded over many years, particularly in Barcelona (95 years), apart from many other places around the world, such as Hong Kong.
Weighing precipitation gauge
A weighing-type precipitation gauge consists of a storage bin, which is weighed to record the mass. Certain models measure the mass using a pen on a rotating drum, or by using a vibrating wire attached to a data logger. The advantages of this type of gauge over tipping buckets are that it does not underestimate intense rain, and it can measure other forms of precipitation, including rain, hail, and snow. These gauges are, however, more expensive and require more maintenance than tipping bucket gauges.
The weighing-type recording gauge may also contain a device to measure the number of chemicals contained in the location's atmosphere. This is extremely helpful for scientists studying the effects of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere and their effects on the levels of the acid rain. Some Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) units use an automated weighing gauge called the AWPAG (All Weather Precipitation Accumulation Gauge).
Tipping bucket rain gauge
The tipping bucket rain gauge consists of a funnel that collects and channels the precipitation into a small seesaw-like container. After a pre-set amount of precipitation falls, the lever tips, dumping the collected water and sending an electrical signal. An old-style recording device may consist of a pen mounted on an arm attached to a geared wheel that moves once with each signal sent from the collector. In this design, as the wheel turns the pen arm moves either up or down leaving a trace on the graph and at the same time making a loud "click".
The tipping bucket rain gauge is not as accurate as of the standard rain gauge, because the rainfall may stop before the lever has tipped. When the next period of rain begins it may take no more than one or two drops to tip the lever. This would then indicate that pre-set amount has fallen when only a fraction of that amount has actually fallen. Tipping buckets also tend to underestimate the amount of rainfall, particularly in snowfall and heavy rainfall events. The advantage of the tipping bucket rain gauge is that the character of the rain (light, medium, or heavy) may be easily obtained. Rainfall character is decided by the total amount of rain that has fallen in a set period (usually 1 hour) and by counting the number of pulses clicks in a 10-minute period the observer can decide the character of the rain. Algorithms may be applied to the data as a method of correcting the data for high-intensity rainfall.
Modern tipping rain gauges consist of a plastic collector balanced over a pivot. When it tips, it actuates a switch (such as a reed switch) which is then electronically recorded or transmitted to a remote collection station.
Tipping gauges can also incorporate elements of weighing gauges whereby a strain gauge is fixed to the collection bucket so that the exact rainfall can be read at any moment. Each time the collector tips, the strain gauge (weight sensor) is re-zeroed to null out any drift.
To measure the water equivalent of frozen precipitation, a tipping bucket may be heated to melt any ice and snow that is caught in its funnel. Without a heating mechanism, the funnel often becomes clogged during a frozen precipitation event, and thus no precipitation can be measured. Many Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) units use heated tipping buckets to measure precipitation.
Optical rain gauge
This type of gauge has a row of collection funnels. In an enclosed space below each is a laser diode and a photo transistor detector. When enough water is collected to make a single drop, it drops from the bottom, falling into the laser beam path. The sensor is set at right angles to the laser so that enough light is scattered to be detected as a sudden flash of lights. The flashes from these photodetectors are then read and transmitted or recorded. Different type of optical range gauges have been used throughout the decades. The technology has also improved.
Acoustic rain gauge
Acoustic disdrometers, also referred to as hydrophones, are able to sense the sound signatures for each drop size as rain strikes a water surface within the gauge. Since each sound signature is unique, it is possible to invert the underwater sound field to estimate the drop-size distribution within the rain. Selected moments of the drop-size distribution yield rainfall rate, rainfall accumulation, and other rainfall properties.

Staging Point () is one of five drawings depicting the life of children in the Warsaw ghetto in the collection of the Jewish Historical Institute, Warsaw. The author of the drawings is an unknown draftsman, but they are signed "Rozenfeld". The drawing was made, most probably, between autumn and winter of 1941 and commissioned as part of the Ringelblum Archive - which has been inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 1999.
The drawing is set at 5/7 Stawki Street, which was used to hold Jewish children arrested by the "Blue police" outside the ghetto district. The "staging point" was the place where arrested children would wait for their parents, who were obliged to pay a fine. Orphans would instead be sent to an orphanage.
The drawing depicts a group of seven children arrested by the Jewish Ghetto Police for the crime of smuggling food.

Tianwen-2, formerly known as ZhengHe, is a planned Chinese asteroid sample-return and comet exploration mission that is currently under development.
Overview
Tianwen-2 is planned to be launched by a Long March 3B rocket around 2025. It will use solar electric propulsion to explore the co-orbital near-Earth asteroid 469219 Kamoʻoalewa and the main-belt comet 311P/PANSTARRS. The spacecraft will rendezvous with Kamoʻoalewa and conduct remote sensing observations in orbit, before landing on the asteroid to collect a sample of of regolith. A nano-orbiter and nano-lander will be deployed to conduct remote sensing and sampling observations, and explosives will be used to expose potential subsurface volatiles for detection.
The spacecraft will use both anchor-and-attach and touch-and-go methods to attempt collection of a sample from the asteroid. It would be the first time an anchor-and-attach method has been used on an asteroid, as both OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa2 used touch-and-go.
Tianwen-2 will then return to Earth to drop off a return capsule containing the sample and conduct a gravity assist maneuver to propel the spacecraft toward Mars, where a second gravity assist will be performed to direct it to 311P/PANSTARRS. A flyby of an unnamed asteroid may also be attempted en route to 311P/PANSTARRS. Remote sensing and in-situ measurements will be conducted at 311P/PANSTARRS for at least one year.
The original name of this mission referenced the 15th century Ming Dynasty explorer ZhengHe.
History
In 2018, a deep space exploration roadmap covering the 2020–2030 timeframe was proposed by researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which included an asteroid exploration mission planned for launch around 2022 or 2024. In spring 2019, after a design study for the mission was carried out by the Chinese Academy of Space Technology (CAST), the CNSA began soliciting international proposals for scientific instruments to be carried on Tianwen-2.
Instruments
Tianwen-2 will incorporate several types of instruments, including wide/narrow angle multispectral and color cameras, a thermal emission spectrometer, a visible/near-infrared imaging spectrometer, a mass spectrometer, a magnetometer, and a charged/neutral particle and dust analyzer. International contributions to these payloads are being encouraged.
The United Kingdom is considering a proposal for a penetrator to deliver a mass spectrometer to probe the subsurface ice of 311P/PANSTARRS.

The Spitfire Mark II, later given the name Tigershark, was a utility helicopter built in the United States in the late 1970s and intended for series production. It was a further evolution of the Spitfire Mark I design, a turbine-powered conversion of the Enstrom F-28. Although airframe changes on the Mark I had been minimal, the Mark II had a substantially redesigned fuselage that rearranged the F-28's 2+2 seating to move the pilot's seat forward in the nose by itself and add a bench seat for three passengers abreast behind it. The leftmost seat on the bench could be fitted with dual controls. The fuselage was lengthened, and the powerplant installation (the same Allison 250 used on the Mark I) was mounted well to the rear. The Mark II still used the dynamic components of the F-28, plus some of its airframe.
Spitfire displayed a mockup of the Mark II at the Helicopter Association of America meeting in Anaheim, California in February 1977. The prototype first flew in February 1979 and by July that year, the company reported that it had sold 42 examples of the Mark I and Mark II and expected to build 60 aircraft during 1980.
However, Spitfire remained dependent on Enstrom to supply airframes for remanufacture, and Enstrom distanced itself from the project somewhat. Competing plans by Enstrom and Spitfire to market Polish-built Mil Mi-2 helicopters in the United States might have contributed to the friction. In Spitfire's version of the deal, Polish manufacturer PZL-Świdnik (represented by its trade bureau Pezetel) would also contribute to the Spitfire manufacturing efforts. By November 1979, Enstrom refused to supply airframes to Spitfire.
The situation improved somewhat in the 1980s, and Spitfire president Jack Fetsko reported in May 1983 that relations with Enstrom were at the point where the two companies could "talk programs". By that time, costs for the Mark II, now dubbed the Tigershark, had increased from $US 185,000 expected in 1979 to $US 305,000 but Spitfire had a firm sale for the first production aircraft. Together with companies Sodian and Soprea, Spitfire formed a new venture, Spitfire Helicopters International, to manufacture the Mark I and Mark II in Málaga, Spain.
Nothing came of the joint venture, and Spitfire's attempts to market F-28 derivatives came to an end.

was a Japanese immunologist who, with their wife Teruko Ishizaka, discovered the antibody class Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in 1966–1967. Their work was regarded as a major breakthrough in the understanding of allergy. They were awarded the 1973 Gairdner Foundation International Award and the 2000 Japan Prize for their work in immunology.
Early life and education
Ishizaka was born in Tokyo to Koki and Kiku Ishizaka. Their father was a career soldier who retired in 1933 as a lieutenant general.
Ishizaka obtained their medical qualifications and PhD in 1948 from the University of Tokyo. They "was captivated by immunology while taking a summer course in college" and abandoned plans to become a physician.
Career
From 1953 to 1962, they headed the immunoserology division at the department of serology at the Japanese National Institute of Health. During their tenure in that position they spent two years as a research fellow at Caltech (1957–1959).
In 1962, Ishizaka and their wife Teruko were recruited by Sam Bukantz, medical director of the Children's Asthma Research Institute and Hospital (CARIH), and moved to Denver, Colorado. They assumed the post of assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Colorado Medical School, as well as chief of immunology of its associated Children's Asthma Research Institute and CARIH. In 1965, they were promoted to associate professor at University of Colorado Denver.
While at Denver, the Ishizakas discovered the antibody class Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in 1966–1967 and its interplay with mast cells. They demonstrated the IgE's critical role in mediating the release of histamine from mast cells. The discovery of IgE is considered a milestone in immunology and the understanding of allergy.
In 1970, Ishizaka was appointed as O'Neill Professor of Medicine and Microbiology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, as well as professor of biology at the Faculty of Arts and Science. From 1982 to 1986, they served as president of the Collegium International Allergologicum. They were elected a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1983. Ishaka remained at the university until 1989, when they became scientific director, and then president in 1990, of the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology in La Jolla, California.
After retiring in 1996, they returned to Japan and served as honorary director of the Institute of Immunology at Yamagata University.
Recognition
The Ishizakas received numerous awards for their work in allergy and immunology. In 1972, they received the Passano Foundation Award. In 1973, they received the German Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize, the Takeda Medical Award, the first Scientific Achievement Award of the International Association of Allergology and together received the Gairdner Foundation International Award. In 1974, they received the Asahi Cultural Award, the Imperial Prize of the Japan Academy, and the Japanese Order of Culture. In 1979, they received the Borden Award. In 2000, they were awarded the 16th Japan Prize.
Personal life and death
Ishizaka was married to Teruko Ishizaka, their partner in many of their discoveries. They died of heart failure at the age of 92 on 6 July 2018 at Yamagata University Hospital in Yamagata, Yamagata.

The Club Quarters Hotel is a 16-story, Beaux-Arts high-rise at 710 Fannin Street in downtown Houston, Texas, United States. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Texas State Hotel.
History
Site
The Texas State Hotel is located at 720 Fannin, at the corner of Fannin and Rusk in downtown Houston. As recently as 2007, it shared Block 80 with the Kress Building (1913), the Houston Bar Center, and the Kirby Building. This last two buildings have been modified with modern slipcovers. The 2008 NRHP nomination form reported eleven buildings within a block of the Texas State Hotel which predated World War II. The predominant land use of Block 80 was originally residential. The First Baptist Church once occupied the Texas State Hotel site, a neighborhood church
which was built in 1883 and occupied through 1905. One commercial building was located on Block 80 in the late-nineteenth century, with two large houses situated on large lots with outbuildings. One of these houses had an address on Rusk Street, the other on Capitol street. They persisted through 1924, even as Main Street hosted extensive commercial development. Block 80 consisted completely of commercial development after 1924. The First Baptist Church site lay vacant for two decades until the construction of the Texas State Hotel.
Building
The Texas State Hotel was designed by Joseph Finger, a local architect. The footprint of the sixteen-story, steel-framed building was a C-shape facing both Fannin and Rusk streets. The hotel was owned by Jesse H. Jones.
The Texas State Hotel was originally planned for the 1928 Democratic National Convention, but due to construction and finance difficulties, was not completed until 1929 (with the help of Jesse Holman Jones).
At one point in the 1980s, The University of Texas owned the property and a hotel-management group ran the hotel, but it proved unprofitable and closed.
The Hotel eventually went up for auction in 1987, at which a subsidiary of Texaco had the winning bid of $1.39 million for the property, which was located across the street of their, at the time headquarters at 1111 Rusk. It was left unused until Fannin & Rusk, LP took over the property for redevelopment.
The renovation of the Texas State Hotel won the 2006 Good Brick Awards, given by the Greater Houston Preservation Alliance to honor exceptional preservation projects and the people behind them. Since it has opened, it has featured a restaurant, Table 7 Bistro, on the bottom floor.
Residences
The hotel building includes several residences, which have the same amenities as the regular guests
The residences are zoned to the Houston Independent School District (HISD). Residents are zoned to the Gregory-Lincoln Education Center (for grades K-8), and Northside High School (formerly Davis High School). Residents were previously zoned to Bruce Elementary School, and E.O. Smith Education Center (for middle school).

Commissioned by the wealthy French Jewish banker Louis Cahen d'Anvers in 1880, the painting depicts their daughter Irène Cahen d'Anvers at the age of 8. During World War II, the painting was stolen by the Nazis during their organized looting of European countries. In 1946 it resurfaced and was exhibited in Paris as one of the "French masterpieces found in Germany". In 2014, it appeared in the movie The Monuments Men as one of the pieces of art saved by the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program.
History
In the 1870s-80s, Renoir frequently painted portraits for the families of the Parisian Jewish community. Through the collector Charles Ephrussi, proprietor of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts, Renoir met Louis Cahen d'Anvers. The Cahen d'Anvers family was one of the wealthiest Jewish banking families in Paris. In 1880, Louis Cahen d'Anvers commissioned two portraits of their three daughters, the eldest of whom was Irène. The younger daughters Alice and Elizabeth would become the subject of a later painting by Renoir, now commonly known as Pink and Blue.
The Portrait of Irène Cahen d'Anvers, also commonly called Little Irene, is considered today as one of Renoir's masterpieces. At the time, for an unknown reason, Louis was so dissatisfied with the painting that they hung it in the servants' quarters and delayed Renoir's payment of 1500 francs.
In 1883, the painting was first exhibited in the first exhibition dedicated exclusively to Renoir, held in Paul Durand-Ruel's Boulevard des Capucines gallery. In 1910 the painting was purchased by the wealthy Camondo family, into which Irène had married in 1891.
After the fall of France, the painting was looted from Château de Chambord by the Nazis. Like many other important pieces of European art, it became a part of Hermann Göring's personal collection, Göring later traded the painting with Gustav Rochlitz for a Florentine Tondo. In 1946, Portrait of Irène Cahen d'Anvers resurfaced and was exhibited in Paris as one of the "French masterpieces found in Germany". The painting along with dozens of other artwork stolen by the Nazis was later acquired by Emil Georg Bührle, a Swiss industrialist, art collector of German origin and CEO of the armaments company Oerlikon, a wartime supplier of the German military. The painting remains part of the E.G. Bührle Collection in Zürich.
In 2014, it appeared in the movie The Monuments Men as one of the pieces of art saved by the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program. In 2018, Little Irène gained popularity in Japan when it was exhibited in the National Art Center in Tokyo, as part of a series on Impressionist artworks on loan from the E.G. Bührle Collection.
Irène Cahen d'Anvers
Irène Cahen d'Anvers (1872–1963), the subject of this painting, was 8 years old at the time of the portrait. The eldest daughter of the wealthy Jewish French banker Count Louis Cahen d'Anvers, they married Count Moïse de Camondo in 1891. They separated in August 1897 after their affair with de Camondo's stable master, Count Charles Sampieri (1863-1930), whom they would later marry and divorce.
Irène had two children with de Camondo, Nissim and Béatrice. During World War I Nissim became a fighter pilot of the French Air Force and was killed in action in 1917 over Lorraine. In 1935, Moïse de Camondo bequeathed their Parisian mansion, at 63 rue de Monceau, including its contents and a major collection of art, to the Musée des Arts Décoratifs to be used to create the Musée Nissim de Camondo in honour of their and Irène's son. During World War II, Béatrice, their ex-husband and their two children were murdered by the Nazis in Auschwitz because of their Jewish ancestry. Irène spent the war in hiding in Paris (apartment rue de la Tour) using their Italian name and passport. As their daughter Béatrice's sole inheritor, Irène received the large de Camondo fortune, that they would squander in the casinos of the French Riviera. Irène also had a daughter with Sampieri, Claude Germaine (1903-1995), who would marry the French fighter ace and race car driver André Dubonnet. Irène lived until 1963 and died in Paris, aged 91.

The Rajah Quilt is a large quilt that was created by women convicts in 1841 whilst travelling from Woolwich to Hobart using materials organised by Lydia Irving of the British Ladies Society for promoting the reformation of female prisoners convict ship sub-committee. The quilt was presented to Jane Franklin. The quilt was sent back to Britain for Elizabeth Fry, the leader of the British Ladies Society. The quilt's provenance was then unclear until it was rediscovered in 1989. It is now held by the National Gallery of Australia.
History
Lydia Irving served on Elizabeth Fry's British Ladies Society for promoting the reformation of female prisoners convict ship sub-committee and they had a financial success when they persuaded the Navy board to fund "gifts" for the convicts. These basic items included knives, forks, aprons and notably, sewing materials. During the 25 years that Fry was involved with the organisation, 12,000 women were transported on 106 ships. The plan was to visit every ship on the night before it sailed to calm the women bound for Australia.
The sewing materials were supplied for the 180 women prisoners imprisoned on the Rajah. The women's names are still known. They had been assembled from across Britain, and they had been sentenced in Inverness, Aberdeen, Lincolnshire, Devon and the central criminal court. They set sail from Woolwich on 5 April 1841 and arrived on 19 July 1841 at Hobart in Tasmania. During the journey some of the women had embroidered and sewn the materials into an appliquéd coverlet now known as the Rajah quilt. The arranger of this quilt is believed to be Kezia Elizabeth Hayter who was the only free woman. They had come from the Millbank Penitentiary to assist Franklin in forming their own committee to mirror the one in the UK. It is thought now that about 29 women were involved. The convict sub-committee'''s work was remembered by the women on board. The quilt includes a message embroidered in silk thread giving thanks to the "convict ship committee". The quilt was presented to the governor's wife, Jane Franklin. The text on the quilt reads:To the ladies of the convict ship committee, this quilt worked by the convicts of the ship Rajah during their voyage to van Dieman's Land is presented as a testimony of the gratitude with which they remember their exertions for their welfare while in England and during their passage and also as a proof that they have not neglected the ladies kind admonitions of being industrious. June 1841.''
The quilt was sent back to Britain for Elizabeth Fry (who led the British Ladies Society). The quilt then became forgotten until it was rediscovered in an attic in Scotland. It was returned to Australia in 1989. The quilt is now held by the National Gallery of Australia.
Research shows that the quilt was not unique as other references are made to the convict women's needlework. One of the references is to the women leaving their work behind. However, this is the only documented quilt made by convicts that still survives.

Robert Hooper (1773–1835) was a British physician, known as a medical writer.
Life
The son of John Hooper of Marylebone, they were born in London. After a course of medical study in London they were appointed apothecary to the Marylebone workhouse infirmary. They entered Pembroke College, Oxford, on 24 October 1796, graduated B.A. in 1803, M.A. and M.B. in 1804. They were prevented from proceeding to D.M. at the University of Oxford, but they were created M.D. of the University of St Andrews on 16 December 1805, and admitted licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 23 December 1805.
Settling in Savile Row, Hooper lectured there on the practice of medicine. They made a study of pathology, and formed a collection of illustrative specimens. They retired from practice in 1829, having made a fortune, and lived at Stanmore.
Hooper died in Bentinck Street, Manchester Square, on 6 May 1835, in their sixty-third year.
Works
While still a practising physician, they were an industrious writer. Their books sold well, and revised editions remained in print to the end of the century. Hooper wrote:

Mount Rutsen is a mountain in New York. It is located in the Ferncliff Forest, west-northwest of Rhinebeck in Dutchess County. The Mount Rutsen (Ferncliff) Fire Tower is located at the summit.
History
On Mount Rutsen an old stone observation tower was built by the Astors. A second tower was built for the U.S. National Geodetic Survey to help with map-making. Finally, the second tower was built during World War II by the United States Army Corps of Engineers as a watch tower. This enclosed tower contained a telephone as well as utilities for full-time occupation so that enemy planes could be spotted. This tower was particularly useful in watching out for planes attempting to attack President Roosevelt's home and those approaching New York City. After the war, the tower became a popular attraction and was purely recreational. In 2006, the tower was deemed unsafe and was replaced in 2007 by the current observation tower.

Free Villages is the term used for Caribbean settlements, particularly in Jamaica, founded in the 1830s and 1840s with land for freedmen independent of the control of plantation owners and other major estates. The concept was initiated by English Baptist missionaries in Jamaica, who raised funds in Great Britain to buy land to be granted to freedmen after emancipation. The planters had vowed not to sell any land to freedmen after slavery was finally abolished in the Empire in 1838; they wanted to retain freedmen as agricultural workers. The Free Villages were often founded around a Baptist church, and missionaries worked to found schools as well in these settlements.
Pioneering the concept
Starting in the 1830s, in anticipation of emancipation from slavery, the Jamaican Baptist congregations, deacons and ministers pioneered the Caribbean concept of Free Villages with the English Quaker abolitionist Joseph Sturge. Many plantation owners and others in the landowning class made it clear they would never sell land to freed slaves, but provide only tied accommodation at the rents they chose. The aim of the estate owners was to prevent free labour choice such as movement between employers, and to keep labour costs low or negligible upon abolition of slavery. To circumvent this, the leaders of predominantly African-Caribbean Baptist chapels worked with their Baptist and Quaker contacts in England to arrange to buy land through land agents in London, in order to avoid detection. They would hold Jamaican land in order to establish Free Villages independent of estate owners.
For example, in 1835, using land agents and Baptist financiers in England, the African-Caribbean congregation of the Rev. James Phillippo (a British Baptist pastor and abolitionist in Jamaica) were able to discreetly purchase land, unbeknown to the plantation owners, in the hills of Saint Catherine parish. Under the scheme, the land became available to the freed slaves upon emancipation, by division into lots at not-for-profit rents, or for full ownership and title, where they could live free from their former masters' control. Phillippo's success in St. Catherine emboldened him; they founded a Free Village in Oracabessa later that same year.
Jamaica's first Free Village
Henry Lunan, formerly an enslaved headman at Hampstead Estate, purchased the first plot in the very first Free Village or Baptist Free Village at Sligoville (in Saint Catherine parish and named after the Howe Browne, 2nd Marquess of Sligo, the Jamaican Governor at the time of abolition), ten miles north of Spanish Town. In 2007, a plaque was erected at Witter Park, Sligoville on 23 May, as a Labour Day event - to commemorate Jamaica's first Free Village.
Sturge Town was founded in 1838 as a Free Village and still survives. It is a small rural village about 10 miles from Brown's Town, Saint Ann Parish. The village is located on the northeast coast on the island of Jamaica. It is arguably the first free village in the Western Hemisphere but was registered second.
This village was named after Joseph Sturge (1793-May 1859), an English Quaker and abolitionist from Birmingham, England, who founded the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (now Anti-Slavery International). They worked throughout their life in Radical political actions supporting pacifism, working-class rights, and the universal emancipation of slaves. They sponsored the purchase and settlement of Mt. Abyla, which was divided into village lots and sold to 100 families. One of those families was the Nugents, believed to be descendants of Gov. George Nugent and Lady Maria Nugent. Clarence Nugent married Lucetta Campbell, and they had five children, four girls and one son: Minetta, Cindella, Jean, Enid, and Oscar.
Clarence Nugent may be one of Governor George Nugent's grandsons. George Nugent, the 1st Baronet, became governor of Jamaica in April 1801. In 1797 they had married Maria Skinner, a daughter of Cortlandt Skinner, the Attorney-General of New Jersey, United States and a descendant of the Schuyler and Van Cortlandt families of British North America. Nugent and Maria had three sons and two daughters together. Lady Nugent wrote a journal of their experiences in Jamaica, which was first published in 1907.
After the enslaved Africans were emancipated in 1834, they helped established two churches in Sturge Town: Phillippo Baptist Church and New Testament Church of God.
Other examples of Free Villages
There are many similar Free Villages in the Caribbean established through the work of Nonconformist chapels. In Jamaica, these include:
Buxton (named after the abolitionist Englishman Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton) finance being raised through the process pioneered by Rev. John Clark's Baptist chapel, with the support of Joseph Sturge.
Clarksonville (named after the abolitionist Englishman Thomas Clarkson); also arranged through the process pioneered by Rev. John Clark's Baptist chapel.
Goodwill, on the border of Saint James parish, arranged through Rev. George Blyth, a minister of the Scottish Missionary Society and funded by their congregation. Unusual, in being established subject to a raft of local rules and regulations devised by Blyth, or established with their approval.
Granville (named after the abolitionist Englishman Granville Sharp), in Trelawny, arranged through Rev. William Knibb's Baptist chapel.
Kettering, (named after the birthplace of William Knibb).
Maidstone, arranged through Moravian missionaries where, to this day, some of the inhabitants still bear the family names of the original settlers.
Sandy Bay, a little seaside village on the way from Lucea to Montego Bay. Founded as a Free Village for emancipated slaves, it was a mid-1830s initiative of the congregation of the Baptist pastor Rev. Thomas Burchell, whose deacon was Sam Sharpe, executed in 1832 after the Baptist War slave rebellion until they died for the cause of abolition and freedom. Today the Free Village's playing field is named 'Burchell Field' after the missionary.
Sligoville, the first free village in Jamaica
Sturgeville or Sturge Town, eight miles from Brown's Town and named after the abolitionist Englishman, Joseph Sturge; also arranged as above.
Trysee (the name is believed to derive from 'try and see'), an early Free Village in the Brown's Town area.

Gambier, settled by Elijah Morris
Although many of the Free Villages were named after a British man of widely accepted influence or importance, perhaps to help raise funds in England, the Jamaican Baptists and Joseph Sturge were Moral Radicals and Nonconformists rather than in the political mainstream.
One village was named after Anne Knight, a female Quaker abolitionist. Pickering and Tyrell said that naming was "a brave initiative that honoured women in an active, albeit gendered role as reformers at a time when custom frowned on their participation in the public world".
No Free Villages were named after the emerging African-Caribbean local leaders, although free Jamaicans became ordained as deacons in many of the Baptist chapels. They also conducted the schools and public services in chapels where there was no fully English-trained minister available. (For example, Henry Beckford served in this way at Staceyville before and after their visit to London in 1840).
Conditions after abolition for freedmen estate workers
Although the concept of Free Villages proved an immediate success, and many were set up, their establishment depended partly upon success in raising money in England through the Baptists, the Quaker Joseph Sturge, and other Christian or abolitionist circles. For freedmen who continued to work on the plantation estates, conditions could sometimes be harsh. Some escaped to live as best they could in historically Maroon communities in the hills.
An English Baptist minister, arriving in Jamaica for the first time in 1841, described their surprise at the bleakness of the situation after emancipation:
Another circumstance, my dear sir, which has occasioned much surprise, is the frequency with which the most flagrant acts of oppression are practiced by the overseers. Within the last few days the tales of cruelty to which I have listened, have been numerous indeed; for the people, knowing how much advantage is taken of their ignorance, are sure to repair to their ministers for sympathy and advice. In some cases, where the wages have been withheld for months, the people are summoned for the rent of their dwellings which are upon the very property where they have been labouring. Last week from the mere caprice of the overseer, a family on one estate were ejected from their dwelling at a moment's notice, although their rent had been paid.

Jerusalem crickets (or potato bugs) are a group of large, flightless insects in the genera Ammopelmatus and Stenopelmatus, together comprising the tribe Stenopelmatini. The former genus is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, while the latter genus is from Central America.
Despite their common names, these insects are neither true crickets (which belong to the family Gryllidae) nor true bugs (which belong to the order Hemiptera), nor are they native to Jerusalem. These nocturnal insects use their strong mandibles to feed primarily on dead organic matter but can also eat other insects. Their highly adapted feet are used for burrowing beneath moist soil to feed on decaying root plants and tubers.
While Jerusalem crickets are not venomous, they can emit a foul smell and are capable of inflicting a painful bite.
Classification
There are 19 species recognized as valid in the genus Stenopelmatus, as presently delimited (with 13 more of uncertain status and potentially not valid), though the genus was formerly much larger, including most of the species now placed in the genus Ammopelmatus, which contains 20 additional species. The family Stenopelmatidae and subfamily Stenopelmatinae contain several Old World genera, but only the genera in the tribe Stenopelmatini (all New World) are referred to as Jerusalem crickets. Other families in the same superfamily (Stenopelmatoidea) in Australia and New Zealand include the wētā and king crickets. They are similar to stenopelmatines in many respects.
Communication
Similar to true crickets, each species of Jerusalem cricket produces a different song during mating. This song takes the form of a characteristic drumming in which the insect beats its abdomen against the ground.
No species have wings with sound-producing structures; moreover, evidently none has structures it could use to hear sound. This contrasts with true crickets and katydids, who use their wings to produce sounds and have hearing organs to sense sounds of others. Jerusalem crickets seem unable to hiss by forcing air through their spiracles, as some beetles and cockroaches do. Instead, the few Jerusalem crickets that do make sound rub their hind legs against the sides of the abdomen, producing a rasping, hissing noise. This hiss may serve to deter predators rather than to communicate with other crickets. For such purposes, Jerusalem crickets rely on substrate vibrations felt by subgenual organs located in all six of the insect's legs.
Names
Several hypotheses attempt to explain the origin of the term "Jerusalem cricket". One suggests the term originated from a mixing of Navajo and Christian terminology, resulting from the strong connection Franciscan priests had with the Navajos in developing their dictionary and vocabulary. Such priests may have heard the Navajos speak of a "skull insect" and took this as a reference to Calvary (also known as Skull Hill) outside Jerusalem near the place where Jesus was crucified.
Several Navajo names refer to the insect's head:
c'ic'in lici () "red-skull"
c'os bic'ic lici () "red-skull bug"
c'ic'in lici' I coh () "big red-skull"
wo se c'ini or rositsini or yo sic'ini (/) "skull insect"
Other names include the Hopi ("shiny bug"), the Spanish ("child of the earth") and ("child's face").

Their latest project Croatian Rhapsody: Borderlands broaches the turbulent past of Slovenc's homeland, specifically the Croatian War of Independence (1991–95) and its aftermath, as Slovenc investigates issues of identity through the lens of someone who left their country at a time of unrest and rebuilding and now returns to experience their birthplace as at once familiar and alienating.In their project Marble Hill, which consists of four distinct chapters, Slovenc focuses on their neighborhood in the Bronx. They use photography, sculpture, set design, performance, and video to transform this real Bronx neighborhood into the author's imaginary and metaphorical world nested between fantasy and reality. Slovenc is interested in life as a form of theater; particularly in ways domestic spaces have been acted in and acted upon.  They are intrigued by the "scenes" people construct in their homes, as well as the roles people play in their daily lives, with all the semiotic and allegoric referents.
In the series Partners in Crime, Slovenc creates wedding portraits of long term same-sex couples. Inspired by late nineteenth-century cabinet cards, Slovenc photographs these couples to appear both physically and emotionally disconnected. In conflating images of stiff, traditional marriage poses and contemporary domestic spaces, Slovenc captures the public face that society mandates for same-sex couples.For the series Breathing in Kabwe, Slovenc traveled to Kabwe, Zambia to photograph the effects of lead pollution on the local population. With photographs and text, Slovenc has transformed a typical documentary subject matter in such a way that it has become not only about the observed or the observer as individual entities, not about “us” or “them” as two very distinct cultures, but primarily about the relationship between the two.
Croatian Rhapsody: Borderlands (2014–2017)
Croatian Rhapsody: Borderlands is a multimedia project that consists of photographs, photo collages, videos, text, works on paper, fabric art and photogravures. Historically, the rhapsodic tradition anticipates the theme of a return-to-homeland and as such it complicates notions of national identity. Either as a work of epic poetry or as an instrumental composition, rhapsody affords an artist a break from conventional expressions of nationality in the way it references, literally, a "stitched song." That is to say a rhapsody is fragmented, never seamless.Slovenc visits locations that hold great historical or personal significance, and create images in their studio in order to paint a picture of contemporary Croatia. The world that is portrayed becomes a pastiche of stitched moments that fuse art genres and formal conventions, resulting in a perspective that is splintered, a site of violence, exposed and vulnerable, beaten and brutalized.
As an immigrant who spent the last fourteen years of my life outside of their homeland, Slovenc wonders, If they were to rhapsodize about Croatia visually, what might that mean? Would they be like Homer's epic hero, or some contemporary version thereof, who returns after being away for many years, only to find the place is unrecognizable? For the Homeric hero, nothing is as they remembered; everything has changed. Their world is literally covered in mist. It's a fraught experience, this double gesture of identification and alienation.
Finally, these works point to something far more universal than the specificities of national politics or geo-historical coordinates. In a world with over 200 million international immigrants, redefining the meanings of national identity and cultural identification becomes an inevitable global process.
The project is partially funded by the “Foundation for Contemporary Arts Emergency Grant.”
Marble Hill (2010–2013)
This complex body of work consists of four chapters: Home Theater, Harry Black, Portraits and Marble Hill. Marble Hill is a real neighborhood in the Bronx where Slovenc resides. The name also evokes a fantastical place reminiscent of a fairy tale. In this world, domestic spaces look like stage sets and intimate relationships are mere illusions created for a camera. Even moments of great tragedies appear to be theatrical. In each chapter, Slovenc uses different visual language to present daily life as a hyperreal, scripted construct.
Chapter I: Home Theater (2010)
In Home Theater, Slovenc photographs domestic spaces in which sadomasochistic sex acts are taking place. These images grew out of their personal experience in which they solicited people on numerous sex websites where they presented themselves as an S&M practitioner. Even though the images are of the actual, lived-in domestic spaces, they appear to be artificial, hyperreal, grand, and with a slightly distorted perspective, as if constructed as sets for a movie or a play. Slovenc is interested in the performance aspect of our daily lives. What particularly fascinates them is the idea of a domestic space as a "scene" in which we perform our daily routines. By photographing the homes of S&M practitioners in particular, and by contrasting the performance spaces with traditional domestic spaces, Slovenc ultimately questions the notion of the latter as something that is spontaneously, creatively designed or "authored" by us as individuals.
Chapter II: Harry Black (2011)
In spring of 2011, Slovenc moved in with a complete stranger, an older gentleman–Harry Black. For months they photographed their relationship, creating a catalogue of images that resembled photographs one would find in a family photo album. Slovenc used photography and video to create an illusion of intimacy between two strangers. For the installation in the Bronx Museum, Slovenc recreated Black's living room, replacing all the photographs of Black's loved ones with the images of the constructed intimate relationship.
Chapter III: Portraits (2012)
For this chapter, Slovenc turned their camera toward their family and friends. They placed their subjects in their bedrooms, posed them in classical poses and photographed them. In the resulting images, their models failed to fully realize the roles they should play in the intimacy of their bedroom spaces: they should be relaxed, seductive and intimate, but they were not. Slovenc revealed cracks in our
identity roles, small signs that indicated that this was a play. These photographs are presented as large-scale photo wallpapers.
Chapter IV: Marble Hill (2013)
On the cover of the 1966 book “The Photographer's Eye” by John Szarkowski is a black and white photograph by an unknown author that shows the interior of an apartment. While working on Home Theater, Slovenc came across an interior that was a contemporary copy of the mentioned interior. Through a set of unfortunate circumstances, the apartment (that was just a few blocks from Slovenc's apartment in the Marble Hill part of the Bronx, NY) burned down. Slovenc rebuilt the apartment as a scaled down diorama, lit it on fire and photographed it. All the photographs in this chapter originated, as the author explained, from their own version of “Alice in Wonderland”; almost as if the photographs were stills from a post-surreal motion picture. “Moments shown in the photos could occur during the burning of the apartment. Plausible tenants pose for the camera, like in some reality TV show, just moments before they ran out.” – Leila Topic, a curator from the Museum of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, Croatia has written. Impression of theatricality of space and surrealism of the scene is enhanced by the author playing with sizes of photographic enlargements, and awkward spatial relationships within the compositions.
Breathing in Kabwe (2008)
Funded by the Mortimer-Hays Brandeis Traveling Fellowship, Slovenc traveled to Kabwe, Zambia to photograph the effects of lead pollution on the local population. In preparing for the trip, and especially during their stay there, the initial idea evolved to include not only an illustrated essay about people living in an entirely lead-tainted environment but also a deconstruction of the act of photographing the Other. Throughout the months Slovenc lived in Kabwe, they were only too aware of himself, and their own cultural positioning that constituted a very powerful filter through which they viewed things. Rather than privilege either verbal or visual text as the more "authentic," i.e. closer to "reality," Slovenc showed the way in which each type of representation imparts a small, though important, perspective on what they came to decipher as "the real." Ultimately the project has become part travel journal, part interview, part documentary, part autobiography, and part revelation. In short, this project is Slovenc's way of approaching a typical documentary subject matter in such a way that it has become not only about the observed or the observer as individual entities, not about “us” or “them” as two very distinct cultures, but primarily about the relationship between the two.
Partners in Crime (2007)
Partners in Crime focuses on same-sex couples that have been living together for an extended period of time, eighteen years on average. The idea was inspired by late nineteenth-century wedding portraits and the professional techniques employed in them. While most of the earlier works were produced as cabinet cards, shot in studios with artificial backgrounds, Slovenc's reconstructions are in color, taken in the couples' homes. The purpose is to demonstrate the mundane quality of what can only be seen as a marriage setting. In these photos, the author captures the public face that society mandates for same-sex couples. These couples appear to be both physically and emotionally disconnected because in many ways, both subtle and overt, that is how they are told they should behave. Thus in conflating images of stiff, traditional marriage poses and contemporary domestic spaces, Slovenc has sought to normalize what is still, at best, a hotly contested relationship in American society.

John Bowne (1627–1695), the progenitor of the Bowne family in America, was a Quaker and an English immigrant residing in the Dutch colony of New Netherland.  They are historically significant for their struggle for religious liberty.
Background
Born in Matlock, Derbyshire, on 9 March 1627, Bowne emigrated with their father and sister to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1648. Bowne became a merchant and married well, their first wife Hannah Feake (ca.1637–1678), whom they married in 1656, being a great-niece of Governor John Winthrop of Massachusetts. Bowne and their bride, along with their in-laws William Hallet and Elizabeth Fones, soon became adherents of the new doctrine of Quakerism, which was then being actively repressed in most of the English colonies of New England. Accordingly, by 1661, they had relocated to Flushing, Long Island, where a small group of English-speaking Quakers were attempting to practice their faith in defiance of the Dutch governor of New Netherland, Peter Stuyvesant.
Fight for religious freedom
In 1662, Bowne was arrested by the New Amsterdam sheriff, Resolved Waldron, under orders of Governor Stuyvesant, for allowing a Quaker meeting in their house. Refusing to pay the assessed fine, or to depart from the province, they were sent to Holland for trial before the Dutch West India Company. There, they successfully exonerated themselves by appealing to the guarantees of religious liberty contained in the Flushing patent of 1645 granted by Governor William Kieft; see Flushing Remonstrance. Winning the respect of their judges by their uncompromising stance, they were released, and returned triumphantly home in 1664, Governor Stuyvesant being ordered to extend tolerance to all religious sects.
Although New Netherland was soon to become the English colony of New York, the ideal of religious freedom for which John Bowne had stood up was upheld by the province's new rulers, serving as an example for the other English colonies in North America, and ultimately to the framers of the American Constitution as well.
A 1672 letter from Bowne and other Quakers to the Governor of New York explaining their conscientious refusal to contribute funds for the repair of the fort of New York is one of the earliest examples of American Quaker war tax resistance.
John Bowne later served in the provincial assembly of New York, dying in Flushing on 20 December 1695.
Family
John Bowne's first wife Hannah Feake (or Feke) was the daughter of Elizabeth Fones. They had 8 children.
John Bowne's second wife was Hannah Bickerstaff (married 2 February 1679/1680) and had 6 children (2 died soon after birth).
John Bowne's third wife was Mary Cock (married 26 June 1693) and had two children.
Descendants
Bowne's descendants played notable roles in all aspects of life in America, from politics to business and academia. They include:
Robert Bowne (1744–1818), founder in 1775 of Bowne & Co., the company with the longest history of trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Samuel S. Bowne (1800–1865), U.S. Representative for the 19th District in New York
Walter Bowne (1770–1846), Mayor of New York City.
Daniel M. Frost (1823–1900), one of the few Northern Generals to fight with the Confederacy during the Civil War
Thomas Jaggar (1871–1953), volcanologist and founder of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory
Robert Bowne Minturn (1805–1866), 19th Century merchant and shipper
Kyra Sedgwick, actor
Margaret Suckley (1891–1991), archivist for, and confidant of, President Franklin D. Roosevelt
Julia Thorne (1944–2006), 20th-century author and wife of John Kerry
Legacy
John Bowne High School, PS 20 John Bowne Elementary School, and Bowne Street in Flushing, Queens are named in their honor. Bowne Park is named after their descendant, New York City mayor Walter Bowne.
The Bowne House at Bowne Street and 37th Avenue in Flushing still stands, and is open to the public as a New York City designated landmark and a Registered Historic Place.
In October 2018, a memorial stone was unveiled and a lime tree planted on the corner of Lime Tree Road and Hurst Rise, Matlock, Derbyshire, the site of John Bowne's birthplace, Lime Tree Farm.

Martín Nicolás Campaña Delgado (born 29 May 1989) is a Uruguayan footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Saudi Professional League club Al-Batin and the Uruguay national team.
Club career
Early career
Born in Maldonado, Campaña joined Defensor Sporting's youth setup at the age of 13, from hometown side Deportivo Maldonado. In 2006, after finishing their formation, they moved back to their previous club on loan, and was assigned to the first team in Segunda División.
In January 2008 Campaña moved to fellow second division side Atenas de San Carlos also in a temporary deal, playing regularly as their side narrowly missed out promotion.
Cerro Largo
Released by Danubio in the middle of 2008, Campaña joined Cerro Largo of the Primera División. They made their debut for the club on 9 November, starting in a 5–2 away loss to Bella Vista.
Campaña spent their first season as a backup to Fernando Pérez, but was chosen as first-choice ahead of the 2009–10 campaign, overtaking Pérez and new signing Nicolás Gentilio. They were an undisputed starter for the club during year, but suffered team relegation.
After Cerro Largo's relegation Campaña was loaned to fellow top-tier club Racing de Montevideo, for one year. A second-choice to Jorge Contreras, their only match for the club occurred on 13 November 2010 in a 2–0 loss at Danubio.
Returning to Cerro Largo for 2011–12, Campaña was again an undisputed starter as their side achieved qualification for 2012 Copa Sudamericana by finishing fourth.
Defensor Sporting
In January 2013, they moved back to their first club Defensor on a six-month loan deal. An immediate starter due to Yonatan Irrazábal's injury, they finished the season with twelve appearances.
Bought outright in June 2013, Campaña became a first-choice ahead of Irrazábal, being an important unit as their side reached the semifinals of the 2014 Copa Libertadores.
Independiente
On 12 January 2016, Campaña moved abroad for the first time in their career, after agreeing to a 18-month deal with Independiente. They made their debut for the club on 6 March, starting in a 4–1 home routing of Colón.
Campaña became an immediate starter ahead of youth graduates from Diego Rodríguez and Gonzalo Rehak.
International career
Campaña represented Uruguay at under-20 level at the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Egypt, but as the third goalkeeper. They were called up by Óscar Tabárez for the 2012 Summer Olympics being held in London, Great Britain, playing all three matches of the tournament as their side was knocked out in the group stage.
Campaña made their full international debut for Uruguay on 27 May 2016, replacing Martín Silva late into a 3–1 friendly win over Trinidad and Tobago. In May 2018, they were named in Uruguay's provisional 26-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, being also included in the final list on 2 June.

The Sarah A. Haskins House is a historic house located at 18 Harrison Street in Taunton, Massachusetts, United States. It was built in 1852 in the Greek Revival style with transitional Italianate details. The -story side-hall plan house originally featured clapboard siding with decorative wood Greek Revival elements including pilastered corner boards and a front porch with fluted wood columns and decorative ironwork.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. However, the house has since been covered with vinyl siding and stripped of its original decorative elements, including original windows and shutters. Two shed dormers have also been added to the top floor.

Voices-Voix was a Canadian coalition of organizations and individuals seeking to defend democracy and enable civil society. It operated between 2010-2020. Voices-Voix worked on government accountability mainly at the federal level and focused on the rule of law, free speech, transparency, and equality. Working with allies, the Coalition also tracked the independence and integrity of Parliamentary institutions (including officers and agents of Parliament), the role of the Canadian government in working with Canadian companies working overseas, the promotion of the role of public science and environmental protection, and support for the rights of organized labour.
History
In April 2010, more than 100 representatives of organizations from across Canada assembled in Ottawa to address the state of democracy and especially what appeared to be unprecedented sustained attacks on civil society under the Harper federal government. The Voices-Voix Coalition was formed in response to these concerns, and led by organizations working in international cooperation, women's equality, human rights, immigrant and refugee settlement groups, and Indigenous activism. The Coalition noted that open and healthy democracy in Canada requires tolerance for peaceful dissent.
The Coalition was diverse and included environmental groups, unions, academics, human rights organizations, international development organizations and other civil society groups. They shared goals of democracy, human rights - including minority and women's rights- the environment and sustainable development, peace and respect for the law. Under the Voices-Voix umbrella, the organizations united in the belief that democracy, free speech, transparency and equality must be better respected and protected by the Canadian government.
Voices-Voix was among the first in Canada to adapt the concept of an enabling environment that is used widely in the international development context and apply it domestically to civil society in Canada. Its research revealed an overwhelming bias against progressive organizations by the Harper government using a range of tactics, from public vilifications to defunding and attempts to strip leading Canadian non-profits of their charitable status.
In 2013, Voices-Voix launched a national research network to curate and develop research and case studies documenting the state of civil society in Canada, the strength of free expression and the rights to dissent. The network's Editorial Board include leading Canadian academics and practitioners.
The case studies rapidly became the central focus of Voices-Voix's work and by 2015, the Coalition had documented more than 125 case studies. The work has been cited in mainstream media, submissions to the United Nations, reports by the Special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly, the international NGO CIVICUS, and the CCPA publication The Harper Record 2008-2015 among others. In 2015, shortly before the federal general election, the Coalition launched its report, Dismantling Democracy that received widespread attention. The Harper Conservatives responded by calling the Report authors supporters of terrorism.
Voices-Voix continued to document case studies under the Trudeau Liberal government until 2019 when it held its closing conference at the University of Ottawa. It closed its website in 2020. Most of its material is still available on the Voices-Voix Facebook page.
Structure and vision
Voices-Voix was a non-profit and non-partisan coalition. Organizations with headquarters in Canada could become members after endorsing the Voices-Voix Declaration. The coalition was inclusive but prohibited political parties. Member-organizations become part of a dialogue related to the collective action necessary in order to achieve their common objectives.
The communications coordinator was the coalition's only staff member, an expense covered by donations from member-organizations. The Coalition related heavily on volunteers and student interns, overseen by the Editorial Committee, to develop case studies.
The coalition was based on the premise that Canadians elect representatives in order to have their voices heard - not ignored or silenced - and that elected officials are morally obligated to respect the voices and to represent the will of the people. Voices-Voix sought to raise awareness on issues of free speech, transparency and equality in Canada which they believe, are necessary elements of a more informed citizenry and a thriving democracy.
The Voices-Voix declaration called on the government of Canada to: firstly, respect the right to freedom of opinion and expression, secondly, to act in accordance with Canada's democratic values and thirdly, to be transparent - which includes demonstrating accountability and keeping partisan agendas separate from funding decisions.

The Bietschhorn (3,934 m) is a mountain in canton Wallis to the south of the Bernese Alps in Switzerland. The northeast and southern slopes of the mountain are part of the Jungfrau-Aletsch Protected Area (formerly Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn) listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site that also includes the Jungfrau and the Aletsch Glacier. The Bietschhorn is located on the south side of the Lötschental valley and form part of the UNESCO World Heritage Region at the north end of the Bietschtal valley and Baltschiedertal valley. Most climbers approach the mountain from either the Bietschhornhütte or the Baltschiederklause.
It was first climbed on 13 August 1859 by Leslie Stephen, with guides Anton Siegen, Johann Siegen and Joseph Ebener. An account of some of Stephen's first ascents was published by Leslie Stephen in their book The Playground of Europe (1871). The Bietschhorn ascent however is not mentioned in that classic mountaineering book.

Sir James John Joynton Smith (October 1858 - 10 October 1943), commonly referred to simply as Joynton Smith, was an Australian hotelier, racecourse and newspaper owner, and Lord Mayor of Sydney.
Early life
Born James Smith (he added the Joynton later) in Bishopsgate, London, Smith had only the use of one eye, and went to work as a cabin boy aged ten until 1874, when they settled in Wellington, New Zealand. In 1884 they organised the Seamen's and Firemen's Union of Wellington, and was first president and secretary of the Cooks' and Pantrymen's Union of New Zealand. They went on to run the Prince of Wales Hotel, then the Post Office Hotel, and marrying in 1882. However, according to their memoirs, they gambled away their fortune during a brief return to London in 1886.
Around 1890 they arrived in Sydney and in 1891 re-entered the hospitality industry, starting with the Grand Central Coffee Palace, a temperance hotel. In 1896 they took over lease of the Imperial Arcade Hotel in Pitt Street, renaming it the Arcadia and transforming it into a highly profitable residential hotel. They eventually acquired a string of hotels in Sydney and the Blue Mountains, including the Log Cabin in Penrith, the Imperial in Mount Victoria and the Carrington in Katoomba. The Carrington was notable for having its own power plant - its chimney can still be seen to this day - which also supplied electricity to parts of Katoomba. Earlier they had established the Imperial Arcade Electric Light Co, which later formed the nucleus of
Sydney City Council's electricity system. In October 1913, it was reported that Smith had bought the Hydro Majestic in Medlow Bath for £60,000.
In 1901, Smith's interest in sports led to them taking out a lease at Brighton racecourse at Rockdale, and later the Forest Lodge racecourse in Glebe, which eventually became Harold Park. In 1908 they opened the Victoria Park racecourse at Zetland, turning it into a showplace for horse and pony racing and trotting.
Political career
After failing in an attempt for the Legislative Assembly seat of Moruya in the 1901 election, Smith was appointed for life to the Legislative Council in 1912.
They were never active in the upper house and retired when it was re-formed in 1934. Smith also served as president of the New South Wales Rugby Football League. From 1916 to 1918 they were an independent alderman of Sydney Municipal Council for Bligh Ward. They served as Lord Mayor of Sydney in 1918.
After losing their council seat in the 1918 elections, Smith helped Clyde Packer and Claude McKay to launch the newspaper Smith's Weekly (1919–50), for which they are perhaps best remembered, investing £20,000 in its formation. The tabloid, initially printed in the basement of the Imperial Arcade, was aimed squarely at supporting the rights and welfare of returned servicemen, with whom it proved popular. Knighted in 1920, chiefly for their work raising war bonds during World War I, Smith remained chairperson of Smith's Newspapers until 1939 and was granted retention of the "Honourable" title in 1936 for their long service in the Legislative Council. Noted for generous support of patriotic and hospital charities, they were instrumental in the establishment of Royal South Sydney Hospital. They were a director of Sydney Hospital (1911–1932), Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (1911–1932), the Wentworth Falls Convalescent Home, and was first president of the Picton Lakes T.B Soldiers and Sailors' Settlement at Thirlmere.
Unusually for a man whose fortune was largely built on hotels, they were a teetotaller. They were a keen billiards player and played against John Roberts during a visit by Roberts in 1910 at Smith's Arcadia Hotel in Sydney.
They were also involved in the development of professional rugby league football in its early years, having put up the money to back the breakaway code in Australia.
Later life and legacy
Smith died at their residence from 1912 (and former residence of Sydney Mayor in 1867, Charles Moore), Hastings House, in Baden Street, Coogee, on 10 December 1943 and was cremated at Northern Suburbs Crematorium the following day. They were survived by their third wife and a daughter and a son (his eldest child, Thayre, died in 1938, aged 31). Their estate, valued at £326,000, was the subject of a long and expensive litigation. Joynton Ave in Zetland, New South Wales and Joynton Smith Drive in Canberra were named for him.

The Tunisian Baccalaureate, or Examen National du Baccalauréat, is a standardized test that was founded in 1891, a decade after the beginning of the Tunisian War of Independence (1881–1956). Students who successfully complete the baccalaureate are assured a place at a university, but not always to study their chosen subjects. The baccalaureate is both a school leaving and a university entrance examination, and the success rate is lower than for other tests of this type; on average, 60 percent of students who take it do not pass.
After achieving independence from France in 1956, the Tunisian government reviewed the education system, and the Education Reform Law was introduced in 1958. Bac sciences are superior ( better , best ).
General Presentation
Even after Tunisian independence, the title and structure of the Tunisian Baccalaureate continued to be based on the French Baccalauréat and to serve its dual function as a school leaving and university entrance examination. While possibly not as intensive as the French Baccalauréat, in which the written component alone usually involves 17 to 23 hours of testing over a week, the Tunisian version requires examination of its participants in an average of six subjects.
Although it was once recognized in some developed countries, it eventually lost its reputation and value in the late 1970s. To give access to job markets or universities, many states now require diplomas, equivalency attestations, degrees, tests, or examinations such as the Cambridge A/AS Level, Cambridge Pre-U, the French Baccalauréat, the United States SAT reasoning test or ACT test. However, pupils who have passed the Tunisian Baccalaureate can continue their studies at some colleges in France and Quebec.
The principal session takes place each year in early June, and the results are revealed in the fourth week of June. A retest for borderline failures is held in late June, and its results are made known by the first week of July.
Equivalency
Some experts in Education believe that the Tunisian Baccalaureate is comparable to a Grade-12 Certificate, but Tunisians take the exam at 18 years old, when seeking a place at university. A new way to mark the Baccalauréat was created in 2002. It consists of adding 25% of the school-year mark (out of 20) to 75% of the examination mark (out of 20) to obtain a total that is then used for ranking examinees for university places or student orientation.
This practice was abolished in 2016 following the new education reform.
First Session of French Baccalauréat in Tunisia (1891)
The first Tunisian Baccalaureate was based on the French version, modified according to the ideas of Jules Ferry. There were fewer than 500 examinees. From 1891 to 1916, only about 120 people took the test – an average of 5 per year for a quarter of a century. In 1927, however, 27 examinees passed the exam, and in 1938 the number had increased to 58. Until the mid-1970s, the Tunisian Baccalaureate had two parts, a Grade 11 Passing Test for the 5th Year of secondary education and a Grade 12 Passing Test for the 6th Year. It was offered in Arabic as well as French. Speaking and Writing were the two primary areas of proficiency examined in all subjects, including mathematics. From 1976 onwards, the Baccalauréat has been offered in a single bilingual French-Arabic version, taken at 19 years of age and when the student is in Grade 12 (plus 1 year of education). It consists of two sessions of written tests in all subjects. There is also a special version for students with special needs.
First Post-Independence French Baccalauréat (1957)
After the French left in 1956, the first Tunisian national Baccalaureate was held on May 31, 1957. It was seen as an opportunity for Tunisian citizens to construct a baccalauréat to meet their own needs and to further the construction of a rejuvenated state There were 1900 examinees, 1400 from the Tunis Governorate and 500 from other parts of the country. Over 600 successfully completed the exam, of whom more than 50 received a Merit grade.

The Examination Record (2020)
In 2020, Ahmed Kallela from the Pioneer Highschool of Monastir in Monastir obtained 20.15 out of 20 in their Mathematics exam, a record in Tunisia.
Ahmed surpassed the 20/20 mark because one of the tests that are passed during the bac exam counts as a bonus mark added to the average and is not included directly to the average mark.
in 2010, a success rate of over 50% was recorded in the Principal Session, the highest since 2002. The pass rate in 2011 was 52.33%.

History
Prior to the establishment of the resort Landing International purchased the land with the intent on opening a casino called the Landing Casino. After the warming of South Korean and Chinese relations, Jeju granted Chinese citizens 30-day visa free stays. The park expects to provide approximately 5,000 jobs when it becomes fully operational.
In April 2017, the resort opened its first location, the Somerset Jeju Shinhwa World. In September of that year, Shinhwa Theme Park opened in a partnership with TUBAn Company Limited. In November, Landing Convention Centre and YG Republique, a "food and beverage and entertainment complex", opened. In December, the resort opened Jeju Shinhwa World Marriott Resort and Shinhwa Shoppes.
The Jeju Shinhwa World Theme Park opened on September 30, 2017. It covers 280,000 square meters in south-west Jeju. The theme park is split into three zones which covers stories of ancient and medieval times. The park consists of "roller coasters, rides, exhibits, and live performances".
On 25 February 2018, the resort had its official grand opening. In the summer of 2018, Shinhwa Waterpark opened. The resort is expected to open Jeju Shinhwa World Four Seasons Resort & Spa, a luxury hotel, and Lionsgate Movie World by 2020. Lionsgate Movie World is a collaboration with Lionsgate Entertainment Corp. Construction is expected to begin in 2019.
South Korean singer-songwriter and rapper, G-Dragon, was announced as the official ambassador of Shinhwa World. G-Dragon directly participated in the development, designing and planning the concept of the resort complex.
The casinos are opened only to foreigners due to South Korean law.

José García González (Vega del Rey, Lena, 28 March 1938 – 23 March 2020) was a Spanish psychiatrist and neurologist known for having obtained political attributions in the Council of Government of the Principality of Asturias, along with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE).
Biography
García González got a degree in Medical Sciences in the University of Granada, with a thesis named Historia social de la psiquiatría en España (Social history of psychiatry in Spain), which was expanded into Germany and Switzerland, where he, later on, worked as a psychiatrist. García González dedicated most of their professional career to the Social Psychiatry and wrote many publications about it.
They also participated actively in the manifestations of psychiatric transformation in the 1970s, of the Psychiatric hospital of Oviedo, and of the Psychiatric Sanatory of Conxo, in Santiago de Compostela, where they obtained progression in many areas. They also collaborated with the creation of the MIR System of Specialization, established in the 1970s.
García González was a member of the expert's commission which elaboured an infirm for the ministerial commission for the psychiatric reform and obtained the title of "President of the Spanish Association of Neuropsychiatry", which ran from 1983 to 1986. They were also responsible for the establishment of the Mental Health Service of the Asturian General Hospital
Political activity
Thanks to the pre-autonomic constitution of the Principality of Asturias presided over by Rafael Fernández Álvarez in the year 1982, García González was designated Regional director of mental health, and revalidated their position in 1983, as President of the Principality of Asturias Pedro de Silva.
García González stayed in office until 1987. Their labour in this responsibility settled the basis and organization for the Psychiatric reform in the principality. This was considered by the World Health Organization, after they chose it as a collaborative center for that specialization
Time after, between 1991 and 1995, García González, was elected Counselor of Sanity and Social Services, during the presidencies of Juan Luis Rodríguez-Vigil (1991-93) and Antonio Trevín (1993-95). Later on, in 1999, after Vicente Álvarez Areces was elected president of the principality, they became Counselor of Social business, a position they held until 2003.

The British Tenpin Bowling Association (BTBA) is the official governing body of Tenpin Bowling in the United Kingdom, affiliated to Sport England.
It is the official sanctioning body, recognised by International Bowling Federation, the sport's world governing body, for all competitions, leagues and tournaments held in the UK, and is the organisation responsible for the protection, integrity and development of the sport. It also oversees coaching for tenpin bowling at all levels, and is the official awarding body for formal coaching qualifications. The BTBA had a monthly magazine to keep members up to date with the latest news in the sport but nowadays news can mainly be found on Facebook.
History
The first British tenpin bowling centre opened at Stamford Hill. The two principal American manufacturers of tenpin machinery - AMF and Brunswick - had expanded their operations to the UK when it became apparent that they had virtually saturated their home market in the US at the end of the 1950s. The American Bowling Congress (ABC) took an interest in this expansion and helped British bowlers to set up their own governing body.
The BTBA was formed on 26 May 1961. The General Secretary was Maurice Glazer, at that time a professional photographer in Dalston, East London. Their shop became the first official residence of the Association. One of its original roles was to provide official recognition for newcomers to the fledgling sport of tenpin bowling as it grew in popularity across the UK.
It standardised rules and playing regulations, laid down guidelines and provided an independent governing body to which reference could be made in the event of disagreement.
The rule-book was copied almost verbatim from the ABC version. The annual membership subscription was five shillings), which at the prevailing exchange rate was the Sterling equivalent of the ABC's annual subscription of US$1. With about half-a-million members the ABC found this rate to provide them with adequate funds, but it was insufficient to run the BTBA, given that only a few thousand British bowlers were members.
Authority was delegated to each of the counties under the auspices of local area representatives. Some of the area representatives soon came into conflict with the bowling centre proprietors, for example insisting on costly re-surfacing of lanes, which they argued was unnecessary. The proprietors rebelled and set up their own rival organisation, the Tenpin Bowling Proprietors Association (TBPA), in 1967. An Annual General Meeting of the BTBA saw this conflict rise to a head and most of the governing council resigned, leaving Glazer to regroup and bring back all decisions to the BTBA head office. It took several years to achieve a rapprochement with the proprietors.
Glazer continued to follow their instincts in what they believed to be the best interest of British bowlers, became President of FIQ and was awarded an MBE for their service to the sport.
The BTBA has continued to have a considerable impact on the sport, however in recent times has struggled to engage with the next generation of bowlers. As bowling transitions from "sport" to "leisure", and bowling centres remove restrictions like the need to wear Bowling Shoes, Bowling as a sport is in huge decline in the UK. A large percentage of bowling leagues did not return to the centres after the COVID pandemic.
Members
Current members include the Hollywood Bowl, and Tenpin (formerly Megabowl) chains.

Sine nomine (abbreviated s.n.) is a Latin expression, meaning "without a name". It is most commonly used in the contexts of publishing and bibliographical listings such as library catalogs, to signify that the publisher (or distributor, etc.) of a listed work is unknown, or not printed or specified on the work. It is to be compared with sine loco (s.l.), "without a place", used where the place of publication of a work is unknown or unspecified. While it may sometimes be used to disclose an unknown authorship, this is more commonly indicated as anon. or similar.
The phrase and its abbreviation have been deprecated in Anglophone cataloging with the adoption of the Resource Description and Access standard, which instead prescribes the unabbreviated English phrase "publisher not identified" (or "distributor not identified", etc.). Sine loco is likewise replaced by "place of publication not identified".

Cornelis Thymanszoon Padbrué (c. 15921670) was a Dutch composer.
Life
Padbrué was born and died in Haarlem. They came from a musical family and entered the company of "stadsspeelluiden" (city musicians) in their native city, but was dismissed from civic service in 1635 as a result of a long-running quarrel. From then on they supported themselves as a freelance musician, and little further of their life is known. They were buried in 1670 in the Sint-Bavokerk in Haarlem.
Works
Padbrué published several collections of madrigals and motets on texts by, among others, the poets Jacob Westerbaen and by the Haarlem painters Salomon de Bray and Pieter de Grebber. They also composed theatre music for the plays of Joost van den Vondel.
The well-known melody from the round "'O Kerstnacht! schoonder dan de dagen", from Vondel's tragedy Gjisbrecht van Amstel is attributed to Padbrué. Moreover, there also appeared in print two instrumental Symphonias by him, consisting each of a pavane and a galliard.
Padbrué's chief work was the oratorio "De tranen Petri ende Pauli" (The Tears of Peter and Paul) from 1647, also on a text by Vondel. It is considered as the first northern-European oratorio, but unfortunately not all of the work has survived.
Padbrué showed all sorts of international influences, and at most levels their works were different from others produced at that time, but the expression of the words or the "madrigalism" was always the most important factor for him.
Their collection Kusjes (Kisses, 1631) set madrigals to Dutch translations of the erotic poetry in Latin of Janus Secundus of the Hague (1511–1536).

Aaron Voros (born July 2, 1981) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. Voros played in the National Hockey League with the Minnesota Wild, New York Rangers and Anaheim Ducks. They served two consecutive years as the Team President of the NHL Players Association for the New York Rangers and one year for the Anaheim Ducks.
Playing career
Voros played amateur hockey in their hometown of Surrey, British Columbia with the Surrey Minor Hockey Association, also playing Nor-Wes Caps-Junior B of the PIJHL and Junior A with the Victoria Salsa of the BCHL. They were an 8th round draft pick by the New Jersey Devils in the 2001 NHL draft while playing for the Victoria Salsa. That summer they also received a full athletic hockey scholarship to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, where they were named to the CCHA All-Rookie team in their first-year student year.
On March 1, 2007, the Minnesota Wild traded a seventh-round draft pick in 2008 to the New Jersey Devils for Voros. After starting the 2007–08 season with the Wild's American Hockey League affiliate, the Houston Aeros, Voros was called upon to play their first NHL game on November 11, 2007 against the Colorado Avalanche.
Voros scored their first NHL goal, as a member of the Wild, against Roberto Luongo of the Vancouver Canucks on November 16, 2007 in their birthplace and hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. They would go on to score seven goals and seven assists in 55 games during their rookie season. Voros was nominated as the Wild's 2008 Bill Masterton Trophy candidate by the Twin Cities chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association.
On July 1, 2008 Voros was signed as a free agent to a 3-year deal with the New York Rangers.

On June 10, 2010, they were traded along with Ryan Hillier to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for defenceman Steve Eminger.
Known for showing up to training camp in top fitness, they took this attitude and delivered a great camp in Anaheim where they played for the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 2010-2011 season. 10 games into the season Anaheim put Voros on short term injured reserve. On the day after coming off injured reserve, Voros suffered a broken orbital bone on December 8, 2010 in a game in Vancouver. They were placed on the Anaheim Ducks injured reserved list until February 11, 2011.
On February 15, 2011, Voros was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs for a conditional draft pick.
Personal life
Voros is of Hungarian descent, was born at Vancouver's British Columbia Children's Hospital, and was raised in Surrey, British Columbia. Their grandfather and grandmother emigrated from Hungary in 1956 and settled in Vancouver after leaving during the Hungarian Revolution. In an interview in 2008 Voros said that they are proud of their Hungarian roots and would love to represent Hungary on the international level if it were permissible.
In May 2011, Voros and their teammate Henrik Lundqvist opened their first restaurant in Manhattan called "Tiny's & the Bar Upstairs". The restaurant is located at 135 West Broadway in the Tribeca district of Lower Manhattan.

Alan Surgal (November 12, 1916 – January 3, 2017) was an American screenwriter best known for penning the screenplay for the 1965 surrealistic dramatic film, Mickey One, which was directed by Arthur Penn and starred Warren Beatty.
Early life
Surgal was born in 1916 in Chicago, Illinois, and attended the University of Chicago. They were stationed in London as a writer for the Armed Forces Network and Yank during World War II.
Career
Surgal worked as a writer for the BBC during the war. They then moved to New York City following the end of World War II, where they wrote scripts for radio (and co-creating the radio show, This Is the Underground), before transitioning to television scripts. They penned several episodes for the early NBC television series, Robert Montgomery Presents, including screen adaptations of Arrowsmith and The Canterville Ghost.
Surgal became best known for their screenplay for Arthur Penn's 1965 surrealistic dramatic film, Mickey One. To craft the script for Mickey One, Surgal borrowed from their lengthy career as both a dramatic writer and a television comedy writer for Victor Borge, Bob Hope, Red Skelton, and Danny Thomas. While the film, which was released during a New York newspaper strike, initially flopped at the box office, Mickey One is now considered a cult classic, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Director Martin Scorsese later supervised the restoration of the film by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.
Surgal moved to Los Angeles, California in 1978, where they continued to work as a television producer and writer.
Personal life and death
Surgel married Florence Small, a film producer and the sister of former NBC News and United Press International president William J. Small.
Alan Surgal died at their home in Beverly Hills, California, on January 3, 2017, at the age of 100. They were survived by their wife of 80 years, Florence Small, and their two sons, Jon Surgal and Tom Surgal. Alan and Florence Surgal had recently celebrated their 80th wedding anniversary.

The Algerian Ligue 2, also called Ligue 2 , formerly known as Ligue Professionnelle 2 and Championnat National 2, is the second highest division overall in the Algerian football league system. It was professional from 2010 to 2020.
History
The league was created in 1962, when Algeria became an independent nation, and has been played in a number of different formats.
In 2010, the league became fully professional. Prior to the start of the 2010 season, the name of the league was changed to the Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 2 to reflect the professionalization of the league.
On 15 December 2011, six clubs from the league were sanctioned by the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) for not responding to their set deadline (7 December 2011) in solving the disputes between their players. The following clubs were banned from recruiting any player during the winter transfer window: US Biskra, RC Kouba, MO Bejaia, CA Bordj Bou Arréridj, USM Annaba and MO Constantine. The clubs were also informed that, if the disputes are not resolved within a period of one month they would further be sanctioned with a
deduction of points.
In the 2020-21 season, the level returned to its amateur format and were played between 36 teams in three groups of 12 teams, with play-offs between the champions of each group. The winners and the runners-up of the play-offs were promoted to the Ligue Professionnelle 1 and the bottom four teams of each group relegated to the Inter-Régions Division.
In the 2021-22 season, the format changed again, with 32 teams divided into two groups of 16. The champions of each group promoted to the Ligue Professionnelle 1 and the bottom four teams of each group relegated to the Inter-Régions Division.
Clubs participating for the 2022–23 season

Clos Saint-Jacques is a Premier Cru vineyard used to produce red wine from Pinot noir grapes in the Côte de Nuits region of Burgundy. It is situated in the Gevrey-Chambertin Appellation d'origine contrôlée.
History
The vineyard was named after a statue of Saint James that had been placed in the area, as it was a resting point on the way to Santiago de Compostela, the destination of the Way of St. James pilgrimage.
In the seventeenth century, ownership of the vineyard passed from the Cathedral Chapter of Saint-Mammes to the Morizot family. Throughout the 19th century, the vineyard was a Monopole of the Comte de Moucheron.
It was split up and sold in 1954 by the Comte de Moucheron to four producers. One of these producers was Henri Esmonin, who at the time of the sale was the metayage for the vineyard and bought 1.6 hectares. The other producers were Domaine Armand Rousseau who purchased 2.20 hectares, approximately 1 hectare was purchased by the Fourrier family and 2 hectares were purchased by Domaine Clair-Dau.
The bottom section of the vineyard was planted with alfalfa instead of grapes up until the sale in 1954. Vines were planted shortly afterward by the new owners.
Status
Two authorities on Burgundy prior to the present day Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) official classification, Dr Jules Lavelle in 1855 and Camille Rodier in 1920, both rated Clos Saint-Jacques as the highest level of "1ère Cuvée".
A decision was made in the 1930s by the newly formed INAO that only vineyards directly touching the borders of the Chambertin and Clos de Beze vineyards would be eligible to be designated as Grand Cru in Gevrey-Chambertin, so Clos Saint-Jacque was given Premier Cru status.
Modern wine writers such as Clive Coates say that Clos Saint-Jacques "is clearly head and shoulders above all the other Gevrey premier crus" and "like Clos-Saint-Jacques in Gevrey Chambertin, is regarded by most - and priced accordingly - as the equal of a grand cru". Jancis Robinson says that Clos Saint Jacques is "always regarded as a Grand Cru in all but name".
Production
The vineyard is 6.7 hectares in size and there are five strips, running from the top to the bottom of the vineyard, currently owned by five different producers. The largest holder is Domaine Armand Rousseau with the original 2.20 hectares purchased by the Domaine. Sylvie Esmonin, the granddaughter of Henri Esmonin, holds 1.60 hectares. Bruno Clair and Maison Louis Jadot own 1 hectare each, which was split between them from the land purchased by Domaine Clair-Dau. Domaine Fourrier holds 0.89 of a hectare that was originally purchased by the family.

Images is an album by pianist Kenny Barron recorded in New York in 2003 and released on the Sunnyside label.
Reception
In the review on Allmusic, Thom Jurek noted "this is another fine date by a pianist who seems to restlessly climb another rung with every outing even though they have been at the top of their game for decades". On All About Jazz John Kelman wrote "Barron shows with Images that they deserve to be recognized as much a leader and composer as an accompanist. And with this fine quintet on the road this summer, hopefully concentrating on material from the recording, more people will come to see them as exactly that". while Russ Musto observed "The flute and vibes grouping gives this unit an appealingly distinctive sound that is airy but never light, sweet but not saccharine ... Barron is, not surprisingly, superb throughout, more than living up to their ever-growing reputation as one of the greatest pianist/composers of the day".

Mangifera indica, commonly known as mango, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is a large fruit tree, capable of growing to a height of . There are two distinct genetic populations in modern mangoesthe "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".
Description
It is a large green tree, valued mainly for its fruits, both green and ripe. Approximately 500 varieties have been reported in India. It can grow up to tall with a similar crown width and a trunk circumference of more than . The leaves are simple, shiny and dark green.
Red-yellow flowers appear at the end of winter, and also at the beginning of spring. Both male and female flowers are borne on same tree. Climatic conditions have a significant influence on the time of flowering. In South Asia, flowering starts in December in the south, in January in Bihar and Bengal, in February in eastern Uttar Pradesh, and in February–March in northern India. The duration of flowering is 20–25 days for the Dasheri variety, while panicle emergence occurs in early December and flower opening is completed by February. The Neelum variety produces two crops a year in Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu, but it flowers only once in North Indian conditions.
The mango is an irregular, egg-shaped fruit which is a fleshy drupe. Mangos are typically long and greenish yellow in color. The fruits can be round, oval, heart, or kidney shaped. Mango fruits are green when they are unripe. The interior flesh is bright orange and soft with a large, flat pit in the middle. Mangos are mature in April and May. Raw mangos can be used in the making of pickles and chutneys. Ripe mangos are a popular fruit throughout the world. The skin and pulp account for 85% of the mango's weight, and the remaining 15% comes from the stone (seed).
Chemistry
Mangiferin (a pharmacologically active hydroxylated xanthone C-glycoside) is extracted from mango at high concentrations from the young leaves (172 g/kg), bark (107 g/kg), and from old leaves (94 g/kg). Allergenic urushiols are present in the fruit peel.
Taxonomy
Mangoes are believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica were domesticated separately in South Asia and Southeast Asia over centuries, resulting in two distinct genetic populations in modern mangoesthe "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".
The species was first described by Linnaeus in 1753.
Distribution and habitat
Since their domestication in southeastern Asia, mangoes have been introduced to other warm regions of the world.
The tree grows best in well-drained sandy loam; it does not grow well in heavy wet soils. The optimal pH of the soil should be between 5.2 and 7.5.
Cultivation
Toxicity
Urushiols in the fruit peel can trigger contact dermatitis in sensitised individuals. This reaction is more likely to occur in people who have been exposed to other plants from the family Anacardiaceae, such as poison oak and poison ivy, which are widespread in the United States.
The wood is known to produce phenolic substances that can cause contact dermatitis.
Uses
The tree is more known for its fruit rather than for its timber. However, mango trees can be converted to lumber once their fruit-bearing lifespan has finished. The wood is susceptible to damage from fungi and insects. The wood is used for musical instruments such as ukuleles, plywood and low-cost furniture.
Culture
The mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan, and the Philippines, and is the national tree of Bangladesh.

Uskedalen Church () is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Kvinnherad Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. It is located in the village of Uskedal. It is the church for the Uskedalen parish which is part of the Sunnhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in 1914 using plans drawn up by the architects Olaf Nordhagen and Engel Sundfjord. The church seats about 226 people.
History
A burial ground was built in Uskedal in 1896 and consecrated in February 1897. The idea of building a church in Uskedal was put forward at the same time by the people of the village, but the Church Ministry's consent was not given until 1913 when permission was given to build a chapel on a designated plot on the Myklebust farm using designs drawn up by Olaf Nordhagen. The new church building was consecrated on 16 December 1914. It stood in its original design until 1964 when a major renovation work was started according to plans prepared by architect Ole Halvorsen from Bergen. In this renovation, the chancel and sacristies were enlarged and reconfigured and the church porch was also enlarged and the tower was redesigned as well.

Linda LeGarde Grover is an Anishinaabe novelist and short story writer. An enrolled member of the Bois Forte Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, they are a professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota Duluth, as well as a columnist for the Duluth News Tribune.
Biography
Grover's debut collection of short stories, The Dance Boots, won the Flannery O'Connor Award and the 2011 Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize, their poetry collection The Sky Watched: Poems of Ojibwe Lives the Red Mountain Press Editor's Award and the 2017 Northeastern Book Award for Poetry. Them first novel, The Road Back to Sweetgrass received the Wordcraft Circle of Native Writers and Storytellers 2015 Fiction Award, the earlier unpublished manuscript the Native Writers' Circle of the Americas First Book Award 2008. Indian Country Media Network described the novel as being "is most notable for [...] its closely-observed and beautifully expressed perspective on contemporary American Indian life". Critic Martha Viehmann places the novel in an Anishinaabe cultural context, writing in the academic journal Transmotion that "The setting on an imaginary Ojibwe reservation with ties to an urban area is like Erdrichs's novels. An English language novel sprinkled with Ojibwe words, many but not all translated, reminds me of Treuer's use of names in The Translation of Dr. Apelles. Satirical descriptions of a white professor who claims to be an expert on Indians and of the bumbling behavior of an outsider remind me of Vizenor's biting humor. The emphasis on the seasonal activities that mark the Ojibwe year echo Jim Northrup's stories. Yet Grover's voice is theirs alone, one that clearly has a place in this growing body of contemporary Ojibwe literature."

Narasaki Senpakukogyo Limited or Narasaki Shipbuilding or Narasaki Zosen is a small shipbuilder located in Muroran, Hokkaidō, Japan. It was part of the Narasaki Sangyo Company Limited. Although still building vessels, the company is now focused on other product lines.
History
Narasaki Shipbuilding began with the establishment of the Tsukiji Shipyard in Muroran in 1935 and became Narasaki Shipbuilding Corporation in 1961. The shipyard is located in the inner harbour of Muroran.
Narasaki was a small shipbuilder which built mostly yachts and smaller vessels. It is now still a vessel manufacturer, but also performs repairs to existing ships.
Diversification
Beginning in the late 1960s Narasaki diversified beyond shipbuilding into other products:
waste water purification equipment - land and shipboard
bridge construction - via Yokogawa Bridge Corporation
machinery - made from steel
iron pipes manufacturing
The need for diversification became more apparent in the 1980s when smaller shipbuilders in Japan began to disappear due to competition from larger domestic and overseas firms.
Sale of Narasaki Shipbuilding
In 2008 the Narasaki Shipyard was acquired by Hakodate Dock Company Limited, a subsidiary of Namura Shipbuilding Company Limited.
Ships built by Narasaki
Roll on/off - lift on/off cargo vessel
large private yachts - especially in the mid to late 1970s
fisheries patrol vessels - CCGS W. E. Ricker for the Canadian Coast Guard
research vessels
sports fishing vessels

Twilight of the Idols (In Conspiracy with Satan) is the sixth studio album by Norwegian black metal band Gorgoroth. It was released on 12 August 2003 by Nuclear Blast and reissued in 2006 by Back on Black Records. It was the only album to feature drummer Kvitrafn.
This was the first album on which Infernus was not the main songwriter. Instead, the music for this album was composed by bassist King ov Hell and Kvitrafn. The album cover depicted a burning church, but due to the ensuing controversy, some copies of the album featured a picture of the band members instead.

Lorena Feijóo (born ) is a Cuban former ballet dancer. Them dance career started in 1988 at the Cuban National Ballet, but left Cuba two years later for more opportunities. After stints at Ballet de Monterrey, Royal Ballet of Flanders and Joffrey Ballet, they joined the San Francisco Ballet in 1999 as a principal dancer, and retired in 2017. They then became an associate artistic director of Bay Area Houston Ballet & Theatre. Them sister, Lorna Feijóo, was also a ballet dancer.
Early life and training
Lorena Feijóo was born in Havana. Them mother was a member of Cuban National Ballet before becoming a ballet teacher, while their father was an actor. Them younger sister, Lorna, would later be a principal dancer with Boston Ballet. Lorena became interested in ballet after watching their mother. However, their mother initially discouraged them to pursue ballet because ballet training in Cuba is "very competitive, the hours are grueling." At age nine, when they were old enough, Feijóo entered the Cuban National Ballet School, which they described as "excruciatingly good." At the school, they received their ballet training under Alicia Alonso, the co-founder of the Cuban National Ballet, in Russian, French, American and Cuban styles, and also studied folk dance, acting, piano, arts, Spanish and French. One of their frequent partner at the school was José Manuel Carreño, who became a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre. They graduated at eighteen, having trained as both a dancer and a teacher.
Career
In 1988, at age eighteen, Feijóo joined the Cuban National Ballet. After spending a year in the corps de ballet, they were cast in solo and principal roles, but less often than they expected, though they were a favourite of Fernando Alonso, a co-founder of the company, who called them their "Tropical Beauty." In 1990, at age 20, they left the company and Cuba as Alicia Alonso restricted Feijóo's opportunities to perform abroad. They recalled Alonso telling her, "Lorena, either you're in or you're out. You choose." They chose to leave Cuba, and was granted a visa by the Ministry of Culture to leave the country without defecting. Despite other dancers' efforts, they had not performed in Cuba since, even though several other Cuban dancers who went abroad were able to return. They added Alonso's preference of classical ballets is also a reason for their departure, but not politics.
In 1991, they joined Ballet de Monterrey, ran by Ann Marie DeAngelo, where they worked with former American Ballet Theatre principal dancer Cynthia Gregory, followed by two years in Belgium as a principal dancer with the Royal Ballet of Flanders. In 1995, Feijóo moved to the United States to join the Los Angeles Ballet, but never performed with the company as it went bankrupt and disbanded. DeAngelo, who had become the associate artistic director of the Chicago-based Joffrey Ballet, recruited Feijóo. They remained in the company for four years, and left when they found themselves "repeating the same repertory."
In 1999, they were hired by the San Francisco Ballet. They were initially offered a soloist contract but Helgi Tomasson, the artistic director of the company, allowed them to join as a principal dancer after Evelyn Cisneros and Sabina Allemann both retired the same year. They made their company debut in Nervi, Italy, when the company was on tour. The following year, they made their debut as the title role in Giselle, their favourite role, and was coached by Natalia Makarova for the Kingdom of Shades scene in La Bayadère. In 2002, they learned Balanchine's Ballo della Regina from former New York City Ballet principal dancer Merrill Ashley. They also consider dancing Kitri in Don Quixote a highlight of their career. Choreographers they had worked with include Val Caniparoli, Yuri Possokhov and Liam Scarlett, including in Possokhov's Swimmer.
Outside of the San Francisco Ballet, Feijóo had performed with the Bolshoi Ballet, American Ballet Theatre and Cuban Classical Ballet of Miami. In 2004, Lorena and Lorna Feijóo performed together for the first time, in a one-night-only Boston Ballet performance of Swan Lake, with Lorna as Odette and Lorena as Odile, roles usually performed by the same dancer. Lorna's husband, Nelson Madrigal, partnered both of them. In 2005, Lorena acted for the first time in Andy García's film The Lost City as a Cuban nightclub dancer, with the dance sequence choreographed by themselves with their mother's assistance. In 2008, the Feijóo sisters appeared on Sesame Street, performing Caniparoli's Lambarena. In 2011, the sisters and José Manuel Carreño performed a rendition of Swan Lake on Dancing with the Stars.
In 2017, their final year in the San Francisco Ballet, Feijóo was also tasked with coaching other dancers. They left the company after a mixed-bill program in April 2017. They then gave their farewell performances as a ballet dancer in June, with Cuban Classical Ballet of Miami, in Pas de Quatre. Later that year, they performed in two San Francisco Opera productions, in Verdi's La traviata and the world premiere of Adams' Girls of the Golden West as Lola Montez. After they stopped performing, they became an associated artistic director of the Texas-based Bay Area Houston Ballet & Theatre.
Personal life
Feijóo was married to fellow principal dancer Vitor Luiz for seven years before they divorced. Their daughter was born in 2012.

The Carleton F. Burke Handicap is an American Thoroughbred horse race run annually at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. Raced in late October as part of the Oak Tree Racing Association series, it is open to horses age three and older and is contested on turf at a distance of one-and-one-half miles (twelve furlongs). The race is named in honor of Carleton F. Burke, the first chairperson of the California Horse Racing Board (CHRB) who later served as the Director of Racing at Santa Anita Park.
From inception in 1969 through 1994, the Carleton F. Burke Handicap was raced at 1 miles. It was run in two divisions in 1975 and 1978.
A Grade I event as recently as 1989, the Carleton F. Burke Handicap held a Grade III classification until 2011. The race was not run in 2008 and 2009 in order to accommodate the Breeders' Cup races. When the Santa Anita fall meet was moved to Hollywood Park in 2010, the race was not run again. As a result, the American Graded Stakes Committee announced that the race was not eligible for grading in 2011. If a race is not run for two consecutive years, it is not eligible for grading.
On October 9, 1977, Double Discount won this race in a world record time of 1:57 for 1 miles on turf.

The Morotai friarbird or dusky friarbird (Philemon fuscicapillus) is a species of friarbird in the honeyeater family Meliphagidae. It is a dark brown bird with pale undersides. The area around the eye is bare and pink. It is around 30 cm long. The species is mimicked by the dusky-brown oriole, which is almost identical in appearance, a situation that has arisen in many species of orioles and friarbirds that exist in the same habitat. This is thought to reduce aggression by the friarbirds against the smaller orioles. It is endemic to the island of Morotai (there are also unproven records on Bacan) in North Maluku, Indonesia.
Its natural habitat is tropical moist lowland forests and tropical moist shrubland. The species is tolerant of habitat degradation and has been observed living in coconut plantations. It is probably threatened by habitat loss, as much of the remaining forest in its range is threatened with logging, but more research is needed.

Paul Philippoteaux was born in Paris, the son of the French artist Henri Emmanuel Felix Philippoteaux. Their education was at the Collège Henri-IV, the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and in the studio of their father, as well as the studios of Leon Cogniet, and Alexander Cabanal.
They became interested in cycloramas and in collaboration with their father created The Defence of the Fort d'Issy in 1871. Other works included Taking of Plevna (Turko-Russian War), the Passage of the Balkans, The Belgian Revolution of 1830, Attack in the Park, The Battle of Kars, The Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, and the Derniere Sortie.
Philippoteaux was commissioned by a group of Chicago investors in 1879 to create the Gettysburg Cyclorama. They spent several weeks in April 1882 at the site of the Gettysburg Battlefield to sketch and photograph the scene, and they extensively researched the battle and its events over several months. Local photographer William H. Tipton created a series of panoramic photographs shot from a wooden tower erected along present-day Hancock Avenue. The photos, pasted together, formed the basis of the composition. Philippoteaux also interviewed several survivors of the battle, including Union generals Winfield S. Hancock, Abner Doubleday, Oliver O. Howard, and Alexander S. Webb, and based their work partly on their recollections.
Philippoteaux enlisted a team of five assistants, including their father until their death, to create the final work. It took over a year and a half to complete. The finished painting was nearly 100 yards long and weighed six tons. When completed for display, the full work included not just the painting, but numerous artifacts and sculptures, including stone walls, trees, and fences. The effect of the painting has been likened to the nineteenth century equivalent of an IMAX theater. It was the largest painting on canvas until at least 1964.
Their Cyclorama of Jerusalem was completed in 1895.
Other paintings included Retour d'un pardon (1864), Vannenses (1865), Marche en Bretagne (1865), and Scene d'invasion (1866), which were all exhibited at the Paris salon.
Philippoteaux made drawings that were engraved by Charles Laplante (fr) to illustrate the 1877 first edition of Jules Verne's novel Hector Servadac (or Off on a Comet).

Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (Bernhard Carl Alexander Hermann Heinrich Wilhelm Oscar Friedrich Franz Peter; 18 April 1878 – 1 October 1900) was a member of the Grand Ducal House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and a Lieutenant in the Prussian Army. They bore the titles "Prince of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Duke of Saxony" with the style "Highness".
Birth and family
Prince Bernhard was born in Weimar the second son of Charles Augustus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and their wife Princess Pauline of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. They were the younger brother of the last Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, William Ernest. Their grandparents on their father's side were the reigning Grand Duke Charles Alexander and their wife Princess Sophie of the Netherlands, through whom they were in the line of succession to the Dutch throne.
Suitor to Dutch Queen Wilhelmina
Closely related to the Dutch Royal Family from a young age Prince Bernhard was seen as the ideal husband to the young Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and was brought up to look upon themselves as their future consort, with their mother Queen Emma a proponent of the match. Although an engagement was reported to be close on numerous occasions the young Queen was not a fan of the match describing their cousin Prince Bernhard as "not handsome" and "not sensible".
When Queen Wilhelmina did not return Prince Bernhard's affection they were reported to have become depressed, dying at the age of 22 in Weimar. Their sudden death was reported to be the result of tuberculosis although there were rumors they may have committed suicide. Shortly after their death Queen Wilhelmina's engagement was announced to Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

Beaumont School is a coeducational secondary school and sixth form with academy status, located in St Albans, Hertfordshire, England. It was founded in 1938 and has become a school of over 1200 students, including 300 in the sixth form. It is situated to the east of St Albans in Hertfordshire and is within access of the city centre.
In 2003 it achieved a Language College status and in 2007, having been identified as a High Performing Specialist School, Beaumont was then able to obtain a second specialism as a Maths and Computing College. In 2007 Beaumont achieved the International Award from the British Council and offered the International Baccalaureate as an alternative to A-levels; as of 2011 the IB is no longer offered at Beaumont school. A December 2008 Ofsted inspection accorded the school a Grade 2 (good), whilst the sixth form achieved an outstanding rating. The school converted to academy status on 1 July 2012. In 2014 Ofsted awarded Beaumont an Outstanding rating following a full inspection.
History
The school was founded in 1938, at around the same time as much of the neighbouring residential area was built. The school takes its name from Beaumonts Manor (later Beaumonts Farm), a manor house whose land once encompassed much of the surrounding area.
Forms and Houses
In September 2009, the school introduced a system of six houses with a form in every year, one for each of the letters of the word "L E A R N S". Students were able to vote for the names of the Houses, resulting up in the following: Luther King, Elgar, Austen, Redgrave, Newton and Seacole. As of 2018, a new letter was added, resulting in the word "B L E A R N S", the letter "B" standing for "Butler", representing the feminist and social reformer Josephine Butler. In the school year of 2022-2023, a new house will be introduced, called Turing. Interform competitions between year group forms are encouraged and take place regularly; testing a variety of skills including sports competitions, science challenges and drama performances. This allows all pupils to demonstrate their different abilities.
School district
The school works in partnership with two neighbouring schools via a consortium, to enhance post-16 educational provision. This partnership is known as "BeauSandVer" and consists of Sandringham School, Verulam School and Beaumont School. Students travel between schools using the consortium bus service.

Linda Haukaas is a contemporary Sicangu Lakota, Native American, ledger artist. Haukaas' work can be found in numerous museums such as the Brooklyn Museum, the British Museum, and the National Museum of the American Indian. Haukaas "breaks new ground as a female ledger artist defying the tradition of this male dominated genre."
Biography
Linda Haukaas was born in 1957 on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in Okreek, South Dakota. They have a brother named Thomas, also known as Tom, who is a pictographic beading artist. Throughout their childhood, they moved between San Juan, Puerto Rico, Sarasota, Florida, and the Rosebud Indian Reservation in Okreek, South Dakota due to their father's government job. Haukaas grew up primarily in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where their mother was from, and visited the Reservation some summers. Haukaas attended the University of Nebraska for college.
Style and content
In their art, Haukaas looks at themes that are "focused on the commonalities which consisted of love, family, traditions, and making art." Them content mainly focuses on "the adaptability and stability of tribal life, the details of the rituals of daily life that provide tiospaye, family individual sustenance… stability, continuity, and a thriving society." Haukaas creates ledger art, which is a "narrative drawing or painting on paper or cloth" and is a traditionally masculine style of art. The majority of Haukaas' drawings are done with colored pencil and ink on ledger paper. They have also been known to use "old period ledgers" to draw on.
An example of Haukaas' style and content can be seen in their drawing, Horse Nation from 2010. This drawing was created on late 1800's ledger paper with colored pencil and ink and can be found in the Brooklyn Museum. It shows four women standing in front of four horses. The women are wearing elaborate regalia that depicts horses in war and each woman is carrying a feather fan and a pouch. Haukaas comments on this work saying it "honors ‘tasunka wakan' (the horse) for its importance for the Lakota People. The horse allowed them to increase their mobility for hunting, expand their territory, strengthen their ‘akicita' (protective warrior societies), improve their economy, relieve their burdens, and, most importantly, gave women someone else to love.”

Kamikaze is an Argentine heavy metal band. Their first LP, No me detendrán!, was released in 1988. Their second work had low sales because of the hyperinflation that plagued the country, and the band broke up after the third album. They had a brief reunion in 2003 for a pair of concerts, and a stable reunion in 2011.
Biography
The initial members of the band were the singer Enrique Gómez Yafal, the guitar player Miguel Ángel Oropeza, the bass player Gustavo Perugino and the drummer Claudio Gabriel Parolari. Their first big concert was on November 14, 1987, at the Roca theater. This concert was selected as concert of the year by a poll between the readers of the Metal magazine, defeating the last concert of V8 and the first concert of Rata Blanca. Perugino left the band, and they were replaced by Roberto Cosseddu. The band took part in the 1988 festival "Halley en Obras", along with Rata Blanca, Alakran and Juan Antonio Ferreira (JAF). The first Long Play, No me detendrán!, was released some months afterwards.
The guitar player Daniel Telis joined the band in 1989, and the band started to produce their second album. Miguel Oropeza left the band during the recording, being replaced by Martín Knye. This delayed the release of the new album, Víctima del Rock. However, the ongoing hyperinflation decreased the sales, and the records label went into bankruptcy. Parolari and Cosseddu left the band, and were replaced by Jorge Cimino and Horacio Pinasco. In 1990 they closed the festival "Metal en acción" held at José Amalfitani Stadium. They released a third album, Kamikaze 3. The band had a frequent coverage in the Metal magazine, and decreased their popularity.
The band broke up. Daniel Telis worked as session musician in Alianza, and Pinasco joined the band Humanimal. Martín Knye started a new band, Magiar. Enrique Gómez Yafal started a new band as well, but refused to use the name "Kamikaze" for it, and named it "Cuero" instead. The band, composed by Gómez Yafal, Oropeza, Cosseddu y Parolari, reunited in 2003, released again their first two albums, and made a concert at the "Hangar" music hall. They released a new album in 2011, Dueño de los cielos, with singer Roberto Fraticelli and drummer Roberto Ruiz. The band organized a tour across the country for the new CD. Gómez Yafal and Telis organized another band, KZ4.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Allan Grant "Angus" Houston, (born 9 June 1947) is a retired senior officer of the Royal Australian Air Force. They served as Chief of Air Force from 20 June 2001 and then as the Chief of the Defence Force from 4 July 2005. They retired from the military on 3 July 2011.
Since then Houston has been appointed to a number of positions, including chairperson of Airservices Australia. In March 2014 they were appointed to head the Joint Agency Coordination Centre during the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and in the Australia Day Honours of 2015, they were knighted for this service.
Early life
Houston was born on 9 June 1947 in Ayrshire, Scotland and educated at Strathallan School in Forgandenny, Perthshire. They emigrated to Australia in 1968 to work as a jackaroo on a sheep and wheat farm near the town of Mukinbudin in the North Eastern Wheatbelt region of Western Australia.
Service career
Early career
Houston joined the RAAF as a cadet pilot in 1970 and was soon given the nickname "Angus". On 20 March 1971, they were granted an eight-year short-service commission with the rank of pilot officer, and was promoted to flying officer on 20 March 1973. They spent the early part of their career flying UH-1 Iroquois helicopters in various parts of Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. On 10 March 1975, they received a permanent commission, with a promotion to flight lieutenant on 20 September.
After graduation from Flying Instructors Course in 1975, Houston completed several instructional tours on Macchi MB-326H, British Aircraft Corporation Strikemaster and Iroquois aircraft. A posting to the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) from 1976 to 1978 was followed by two years at No. 9 Squadron at RAAF Base Amberley. In late 1979, Houston was posted to Hill Air Force Base, Utah U.S.A. for exchange flying duties with a United States Air Force helicopter unit.
In 1980 they were awarded the Air Force Cross for an open sea rescue in gale-force winds off the coast of New South Wales in 1979. They were promoted to squadron leader on 1 January 1982.
After a further posting to No. 9 Squadron as the Executive Officer, and staff training at RAAF Staff College, Houston was posted to the Department of Air (Development Division) where they were involved in the Black Hawk helicopter Project. In 1987, Houston assumed command of No. 9 Squadron to introduce the Black Hawk helicopter, to relocate the unit from Amberley to Townsville, Queensland, and to transfer the capability to the Australian Army. In 1989 they served one year in command of the 5th Aviation Regiment. Houston was admitted as a Member of the Order of Australia in 1990 for their work in the transfer of responsibility for Blackhawk operations.
Following graduation from Joint Services Staff College, Houston was posted to the Joint Operations staff at Headquarters Australian Defence Force and was involved in strategic planning during the Persian Gulf War of 1990–1991.
On promotion to group captain in July 1992, they assumed the post of Director Air Force Policy and negotiated the establishment of the RSAF Flying School at RAAF Base Pearce. After completing a C-130H Hercules conversion in 1993, Houston commanded No. 86 Wing from 1994 to 1995.
Houston attended the Royal College of Defence Studies in London in 1996. They were Chief of Staff, Headquarters Australian Theatre from 1997 to 1999, Commander Integrated Air Defence System from 1999 to 2000 and Head Strategic Command from 17 August 2000.
Senior command
Houston was appointed as Chief of Air Force (CAF) on 20 June 2001 and, in the 2003 Australia Day Honours, advanced to Officer of the Order of Australia. As acting Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) in 2001, Houston played a central role in the Children Overboard Affair. At a Senate inquiry in February 2002, Houston challenged the then government's claim made during the 2001 election campaign, that seafaring asylum seekers had thrown children overboard in a presumed ploy to secure rescue and passage to Australia.
On 4 July 2005, they were promoted to air chief marshal and appointed Chief of the Defence Force. In the Australia Day Honours of 26 January 2008, they were advanced to a Companion of the Order of Australia. In March 2008, Houston's appointment was extended to 3 July 2011.
Later life
After their retirement from the CDF position, the Australian Government appointed Houston as Chair of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board on 6 July 2011, with the remit to "provide strategic advice and recommendations on the planning and implementation of Anzac Centenary events". On 6 December 2011, it was announced that the Australian Government had appointed Houston as the next chairperson of Airservices Australia on the grounds of their aviation, governance and leadership experience.
In June 2012, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that Houston would chair an expert group that would examine asylum seeker policy and prepare a report recommending a solution for the Government's consideration.
In February 2014, Houston was appointed chair of the Defence SA Advisory Board. The position was previously held by General Peter Cosgrove.
On 30 March 2014, Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that Houston will head the Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC), based in Perth, formed to oversee the efforts to find Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

On 26 January 2015, Houston was appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia (AK) for their service to Australia and commitment to the MH17 and MH 370 disasters. Saying they were "surprised and deeply humbled," they said they would prefer to be called by their name instead of "Sir Angus." "It's a great honour to be recognised in this way. But I'd like people to still call me Angus. That's probably the way I am," they said. The ceremony in which they were officially knighted was held on 17 April 2015 at Government House, Canberra by the Governor-General of Australia, General Sir Peter Cosgrove.
On 1 June 2015, Houston was announced as the new special envoy for South Australia. According to Premier Jay Weatherill, Houston is tasked with supporting trade missions, providing advice on international engagement strategies and providing important introductions in key markets. Weatherill also noted Houston's strong relationships with military leaders across Asia being potentially advantageous to the state.
Houston was elected to the role of chancellor of the University of the Sunshine Coast and took office from 1 April 2017.
Houston was appointed to the board of Virgin Australia in December 2018, replacing Mark Vaile.
Houston is an Honorary Patron of the ACT Veterans Rugby Club, the Bomber Command Association in Australia, Sunnyfield Disability Services and the Australian American Association Canberra Division.  They are the chair of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra.

niNe. magazine is an online publication aimed at teenage girls, a production of Nine Media LLC, founded as a print magazine by Melinda Laging and Louise Wo in 2005. Currently an online-only enterprise, its Nine Magazine, Inc. print form reached a circulation of 20,000 and a subscriber-base throughout 43 states, the District of Columbia, and four Canadian provinces.
Name etymology
The niNe. title stands for nine characteristics described in the Christian New Testament, in Paul's letter to the Galatians (5:22-23), as being the ways that the Holy Spirit contributes to a quality life:But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law." (NIV)
The capitalized N is intended to draw attention to the reader's inner world, to promote inner beauty and faith in one's self.
History
Nine Magazine, Inc. was formed in Colorado by Melinda Laging and Louise Wo. While attending the University of Colorado-Boulder, Laging and Wo sought to present a magazine spotlighting current issues and interests affecting youth.
Following graduation, the pair organized a board of directors and established the framework of the publication. With the economic conditions of the late 2000s, Nine Magazine, Inc. began restructuring to improve upon its initial digital platform.
Originally formed as a print publication, niNe. shifted to online-only content to curtail production costs and engage in emerging social media outlets. The periodical began publishing online content in the fall of 2011.
Content philosophy
The editors of the magazine note that current media outlets aimed at young women focus on entertaining, selling, and engaging their audience "through content that is in the interest of the outlet rather than the audience". They note that by addressing the facts of important issues head-on, the magazine can dedicate its pages to promoting self-esteem, volunteerism, philanthropy, positive journalism and literacy for adolescent girls. The creators of niNe. magazine have been stated as using this direct, unabashed approach to educate its audience and reconstruct the manner in which media communicates to a youth-oriented audience. They note that the philosophy seeks to engage the audience in the discussion of a topic without having conflicting messages in its advertising. niNe. is described as seeking to avoid advertisements that demean women or young girls, instead it seeks out advertisers that reinforce the beauty, intelligence, worth and strength of women.
Subjects and topics
The magazine covers issues it perceives to be significant to the daily lives of its audience. As an early reviewer states, "Whether the subject is serious or casual, the magazine strives to dig deeper into these topics. Presenting forums for teenagers in this way empowers them to express themselves in a healthy way rather than turning to food, alcohol or self-harm, often in the form of cutting. This approach helps teens move beyond those crutches and encourages them to positively express themselves."
Sections
As of this date, the following nine sections, following a theme of "the fruits of the Holy Spirit", constituted the content of niNe: hoMe., loOk., boDy., relatioNships., reaLity., entertaiNment., yOu., intuItion., faiTh.

The 1994 Glendalough state by-election was a by-election for the seat of Glendalough in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia held on 19 March 1994. It was triggered by the resignation of Carmen Lawrence (the sitting Labor member and a former premier) on 14 February 1994, in order to contest the House of Representatives at the 1994 Fremantle by-election. The Labor Party retained Glendalough at the by-election, with their candidate, Michelle Roberts, recording 52.7 percent of the two-party-preferred vote.
Background
Carmen Lawrence had held Glendalough for the Labor Party since its creation at the 1989 state election. They had previously held Subiaco since 1986. Lawrence replaced Peter Dowding as Labor leader (and thus as premier) in February 1990, but their government was defeated at the 1993 state election. They resigned from state parliament on 14 February 1994, in order to contest the House of Representatives at the Fremantle by-election on 12 March. Following Lawrence's resignation, the writ for the by-election was issued on 17 February, with the close of nominations on 25 February. Polling day was on 19 March, with the writ returned on 30 March.
Lawrence won the Fremantle by-election held a week earlier, on 12 March, and both by-elections were contested by independent Raymond Conder.
Results
Connolly and Hands recorded the same number of first-preference votes, but Connolly's preferences were distributed first.
Aftermath
Glendalough was abolished at the 1996 state election, and Roberts transferred to the new seat of Midland. They were a government minister between 2001 and 2008, under premiers Geoff Gallop and Alan Carpenter, and in 2015 became Western Australia's longest-serving female parliamentarian. Lawrence was successful in their attempt to transfer to the House of Representatives, and was appointed to the federal ministry almost immediately after entering parliament, where they served until the Labor government's defeat at the 1996 federal election.

Lightning Peak is a summit in the Midway Range of the Monashee Mountains, British Columbia, Canada. It is an eroded volcanic outcrop in the Chilcotin Group. The mountain is located west of Needles, and east of Downtown Kelowna. Peridot can be found at this peak. Lightning Peak is thought to have formed as a result of extension of the crust behind the coastal subduction zone and last erupted during the Pliocene. Like most volcanoes in British Columbia, Lightning Peak is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, that includes over 160 active volcanoes.

Leslie Raymond Fairn (June 25, 1875 – August 13, 1971) was a Canadian architect whose career is notable for its longevity and for the range of styles it encompassed, including Beaux Arts and Modernism. Most of their work was completed in the Maritimes.
Biography
They were born in Waterville, Nova Scotia, the oldest of three children of W. H. and Laura (Lyons) Fairn. Their father was a schoolteacher. They were married twice, first to Bessie Maude (Tupper) Fairn (1880–1918 ) who died of Spanish Influenza and second to Ethel Elizabeth (Hutchinson) Fairn (1900–1982). They had two daughters from their first marriage and five children from their second.
They attended Acadia University and later studied architecture in Boston, later apprenticing with Edward Elliot in Halifax. Beginning about 1901, they earned a living as Principal of Drawing and Manual Training at Horton College (Acadia University) in Wolfville. One of their first commissions was the Kings County Courthouse, completed in nearby Kentville in 1903, and in 1904 they moved to Aylesford where they began to practice full-time. They became a charter member of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) in 1907 and was made a Fellow in 1939. They were also a founder of the Nova Scotia Association of Architects (NSAA).
In 1932 they moved to Wolfville where they continued to practice until their death at the age of 96. Meanwhile, around 1946 they opened an office in Halifax which was managed by their son Laird L. Fairn. This company handled large projects and was known as Leslie R. Fairn & Associates.
Their career lasted 65 years, earning them the unofficial title of dean of Nova Scotia architects.
Their style ranged from Beaux Arts to Richardsonian Romanesque to Classical Revival and Modernism.
Their brother, Clifford William Fairn, also practiced architecture, partnering with Charles Hay and designing several schools in Calgary between 1911 and 1914.

Richard Christopher "Paddy" Hennessey (6 January 1929 – August 2016) was a baseball (British/Welsh) player, famed for their high-speed bowling.
Life and playing career
Born in County Cork, Ireland, Hennessey's early sports were hurling and Gaelic football, but having emigrated to Wales, they used to watch their factory co-workers in Cardiff playing baseball in their breaks. At 21, they played their first competitive game for the works team. They removed St Mary's of Canton for no runs and 13 extras. After a couple of seasons in the lower levels of the league, they were signed by Splott US (University Settlement), and they were an instant success at the top level.
In 1957 they made their debut for Wales in the annual international against England, in Liverpool. They opened the bowling and had the English at 33 for 7, but was removed after a protest over their bowling style and a series of no-balls was called. They were again selected for the 1958 international match at Maindy Stadium, Cardiff, and they bowled England out for just 17 in their second innings, taking Wales to a comfortable win. They were named Welsh Baseball Union player of the year.
By 1962, they had joined Grange Albion, and in that year's international they dismissed England for just 11 in their first innings and 14 in the second, with only four batsmen hitting the ball. Two years later, their performance in the international was even more impressive, removing England for just 6 runs in their first innings, a feat which again helped them to the WBU player of the year award, becoming the first man to achieve the honour twice.
Their devastating form came to the attention of Wales' first-class cricket team, Glamorgan County Cricket Club, who considered that a super-fast underarm bowler could give them an advantage in the new limited overs version of their game. As the first round of the new Gillette Cup loomed, captain Ossie Wheatley invited Hennessey for a trial in the nets at Cardiff Arms Park, with the thought of recruiting them as a "secret weapon". However, the trajectory of a baseball delivery and the trajectory of a cricket delivery were incompatible.
Trivia
Paddy Hennessey is mentioned in "The Baseball Song" by The Hennessys on their album Cardiff After Dark.

Calvin Newton (born 10-28-1929) is an American gospel singer from West Frankfort, Illinois.
Youth
Newton was a boy soprano who took up amateur boxing because they were tired of being bullied. Newton won a Kentucky Golden Gloves championship, retiring one opponent in just 23 seconds.
Music career
In their late teens Newton was recruited to join the Blackwood Brothers, then a prominent Southern gospel quartet. From 1953 until 1956 Newton sang lead for the Oak Ridge Boys, and later they were a co-founder of the Sons of Song, one of the first pioneering acts in what would become the CCM industry. (Please note that the correct name between 1953 and 1956 was the Oak Ridge Quartet.)
Criminal career
According to biographer Russ Cheatham, Newton was "super-handsome, athletic, and charged with sexual charisma...Audacious, Newton never turned down a dare... [hedonistic] -- reckless driving, heavy romancing, and addictive pill popping." Later Newton would spend decades involved in crime: serving time in state and federal prisons for a variety of crimes including theft, counterfeiting, and drug offenses.
Redemption
In their seventh decade, under the discipleship of Jake Hess, who they described as the one who "stood by them when most gospel singers abandoned him," Newton would end their estrangement from the gospel community, eventually reconciling with dozens of former colleagues and appearing in a Bill Gaither-produced gospel performance video titled All Day Singing and Dinner on the Grounds and touring with Gaither's traveling gospel music show.

Dime with a Halo is a 1963 film directed by Boris Sagal. It stars Barbara Luna and Rafael López.
Plot
Four thieving street urchins, led by Chuy, bet $2 on a pick-six horse race every week. A kindly American, Mr. Jones, places their bet for them while visiting Tijuana each week to indulge themselves at strip clubs and with prostitutes. The gang is joined by a new kid in town, Jose, whose sister, Juanita, is stripping at a local club. To get some luck, the kids decide to steal a dime from the church poor box to "make Jesus a partner" in the bet. They win $81,000. Unwilling to trust an adult to cash in their ticket, Juanita contacts Mr. Jones in Los Angeles. Mr. Jones drives to cash in the bet, but has a heart attack on the way. The ticket flutters away in the breeze. Unable to find the betting ticket, the boys return the dime to the poor box.
Production notes
Dime with a Halo was the last movie issued by the Hal Roach Studios. Director Boris Sagal used Roach's forlorn, run-down facilities because they looked like a decaying Mexican city.
The film's copyright was renewed.

International Velvet is the second album by Welsh band Catatonia. It was the band's breakthrough, reaching number 1 in the UK Albums Chart, spawning two Top 10 singles, "Mulder and Scully" and "Road Rage", three other Top 40 singles, "I Am the Mob", "Game On" and "Strange Glue", and catapulted the band and lead singer Cerys Matthews into the spotlight. Album sales reached 900,000, as it became one of the biggest selling albums of 1998 in the United Kingdom. The album was also nominated for the Mercury Music Prize.
Background
Catatonia were originally formed in 1992 with Mark Roberts and singer Cerys Matthews being part of the band that released the critically acclaimed EP "For Tinkerbell" in 1993. Drummer Aled Richards and guitarist Owen Powell joined prior to the release of their first album Way Beyond Blue and the line-up remained the same for International Velvet. Warner Bros. Records had intended to release "Lost Cat" from Way Beyond Blue in the United States in 1996, but due to problems at the record label the band had never released anything in the US until International Velvet.
Release
International Velvet was released in the United Kingdom on 2 February 1998, following the earlier releases of both "I Am the Mob" the previous October and "Mulder and Scully" a few days earlier. It was awarded 3× Platinum status by the British Phonographic Industry on 12 November 1999, meaning that in 22 months it had sold over 900,000 copies. The album was Catatonia's first release in the United States by the Vapor label owned by Neil Young, but it did not chart and according to The Washington Post was "overlooked". It was Catatonia's first album release in the United States. The success of the album was seen as launching the band into the public spotlight.
Five singles were released from the album. "I Am the Mob" was released on 6 October 1997 and became the first single to reach the top 40 in the United Kingdom having reached number 40 in the chart. "Mulder and Scully", released on 19 January 1998, became their breakout hit, reaching number three in the chart, and subsequent single "Road Rage" reached number five following its release on 20 April 1998. The final two singles did not reach the top ten, with "Strange Glue" (20 July 1998) getting to number 11 and "Game On" (26 October 1998) only reaching number 33. As part of the opening ceremony for the 1999 Rugby World Cup at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, Catatonia performed the title track from the album. That track had become an unofficial Welsh anthem due in part to the chorus "Every day when I wake up I thank the Lord I'm Welsh". To promote the album, the band undertook its biggest tour to date.
Reception
The NME said that International Velvet showed Catatonia "to be more versatile than you ever thought possible for such a white-bread guitar group", and that while "I Am the Mob" and "Road Rage" were "out-and-out pop songs", "My Selfish Gene" was a "masterstroke". However, NME felt that when Catatonia performed "typical guitar pop" they lacked excitement. The Washington Post thought that International Velvet wasn't as consistent as its predecessor but included it in a list of the best albums of 1998. The Independent felt the album fulfilled the promise the band had shown for years.
Legacy
In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine thought that the album fails "as often as it succeeds" in changing the band's sound from a late-80's indie pop to something more akin to hard rock. They thought that "I am the Mob" and "Mulder and Scully" had good hooks but were gimmicky and found it hard to understand all the pop culture references. Overall, they felt that the previous album, Way Beyond Blue delivered a better experience.
The album was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize 1998, which was awarded to Gomez for Bring It On. DJ Steve Lamacq hosted a special on International Velvet on their BBC Radio 6 Music series Classic Albums of the 90s in 2010. The album's title track has since achieved an iconic status within the culture of Wales, being performed at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff for the opening ceremony of the 1999 Rugby World Cup, and representing an important part of the Cool Cymru movement.

The William H. Smith House is a historic house in the small community of Atlanta, Arkansas. It is located northeast of the junction of Arkansas Highway 98 and County Road 85. It is a single-story wood-frame structure in the shape of an L. It was originally built c. 1857 as a dogtrot house, but the dogtrot has since been enclosed. The main body of the house is clad in weatherboard, while the enclosed dogtrot is flushboarded, with a porch in the rear and a projecting gable-roofed entry in the front. The entry is particularly elaborate for surviving period Greek Revival buildings, with both sidelight and transom windows. It is the only surviving antebellum house in the small town.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

Seeon Abbey () is a former Benedictine monastery in the municipality of Seeon-Seebruck in the rural district of Traunstein in Bavaria, Germany.
History
Seeon Abbey was founded in 994 by the Bavarian Pfalzgraf Aribo I, a member of the Aribonid dynasty, and settled by Benedictine monks from St. Emmeram's Abbey in Regensburg. The monastery is on an island in the lake Seeoner See, part of the present-day municipality of Seeon-Seebruck. The abbey soon developed a significant scriptorium, producing manuscripts not only for the abbey's own use but also for other monasteries and churches. Their most important client was Emperor Henry II, who presented many volumes to the Bishopric of Bamberg, which they had founded in 1007.
Toward the end of the 11th century the abbey church was re-built in the Romanesque style, but this building stood for only 100 years or so, before in about 1180 it was replaced by the present church, terminating in the east with an apse.
More alterations in the late Gothic style were carried out between 1428 and 1433 by Konrad Pürkhel of Burghausen. The Romanesque basilica was given a vaulted ceiling and a new choir. In 1579 the church was decorated with unusual Renaissance frescoes, showing, alongside scenes from the life of Christ and the Virgin Mary, the patrons, Saints Benedict and Lambert, and the founders, Aribo and Adala. Also of special note is the red marble gravestone of Abbot Honorat Kolb and the gravestones of the abbots of the 15th and 16th centuries lined up against the walls of the castle chapel. In the middle stands the tomb of the founder, Count Aribo I, made by Hans Heider in about 1400. The restored cloisters are also worth seeing.
The original of the Madonna and Child (or the Seeoner Muttergottes, created in 1433 by the "Master of Seeon", as the anonymous artist is known) is considered one of the most beautiful representations of the subject. Since 1855 it has been in the Bavarian National Museum in Munich, but a copy has stood since 1947 on the high altar of the present parish church. The sacristy at Seeon contains a far older Madonna of about 1380.
The church originally had only one tower, that is, the north one, built to the model of that at Frauenchiemsee. The second tower was added at the end of the 12th century. The Romanesque towers are reminiscent of Freising Cathedral and, like the Frauenkirche at Munich, have copper "onion towers", which were added after a fire in 1561. Between 1657 and 1670 the church was extended by the construction of a sacristy in the Lady Chapel, an oratory and a crypt beneath the chapel of Saint Barbara.
Until the secularisation of Bavaria in 1803 Seeon was a place of learning and culture: Joseph Haydn was a guest here, and Mozart was active here between 1767 and 1769.
After 1803 the abbey was dissolved and the buildings were turned into a castle, and used later at various times as a medicinal spa, convalescent home and barracks. The infirmary and the library were demolished, and a causeway constructed connecting the island to the mainland.
In 1989 the premises were eventually acquired by the government of the administrative region of Oberbayern and after a lengthy restoration reopened in 1993 as a cultural and educational centre, which is now used for concerts, exhibitions, seminars, conferences and workshops.
Since 2017, the Christian Social Union's group in the German Parliament has been holding its annual retreat at Seeon Abbey. Notable guests at the retreat have since included Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway (2017); European Commissioner Julian King (2017); Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko (2018); Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland (2019); and President Klaus Iohannis of Romania (2020).

Hysiae or Hysiai (), also Hysia (Ὑσία), was a garrison town of ancient Argolis, also called the Argeia, southern Greece during the archaic period. It was located to the southwest of Argos and east of Tegea, on the road between them, at the foot of Mount Parthenium, not far from the Argive border with Laconia. In , the First Battle of Hysiae was fought between the Spartans and the Argives, who won to repulse a Spartan invasion of Argolis. It appears to have been destroyed by the Argives, along with Tiryns, Mycenae, and the other towns in the Argeia, after the Greco-Persian Wars; but it was afterwards restored, and was occupied by the Argives in the Peloponnesian War as a frontier-fortress. During the Peloponnesian War, in 417 BCE, the Second Battle of Hysiae was fought, again between the Spartans and the Argives, and resulted in a decisive Spartan victory. The Spartans captured Hysiae and destroyed it; all captured male citizens were executed.
Its site is located near modern Achladokampos.

William Edward Smith (born December 31, 1959 in Boise, Idaho) is a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island and a former federal judicial nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
Background
Smith received their Bachelor of Arts degree from Georgetown University in 1982 and their Juris Doctor cum laude from Georgetown University Law Center in 1987.
They were in private practice in Providence, Rhode Island, from 1987 until 2000. From 1993 until 1998, they were also a part-time judge in the town of West Warwick. Smith was the staff director of the Rhode Island office of United States Senator Lincoln Chafee from 2000 until 2001. From 2001 to 2002, they returned to private practice in Providence.
From 2001 to 2002, Smith was an adjunct professor at Providence College. They currently teach as an adjunct professor at Roger Williams University School of Law.
District court service
Smith was nominated by President George W. Bush on July 18, 2002, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island vacated by Ronald R. Lagueux. They were confirmed by the United States Senate on November 14, 2002, and received their commission on the next day. They became Chief Judge on November 30, 2013 and served until November 30, 2019.
First Circuit nomination under Bush
Smith was nominated on December 6, 2007 by President George W. Bush to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated by Judge Bruce Marshall Selya, who took senior status on December 31, 2006. Rhode Island's two Democratic senators, Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, both of whom had been cut out of Smith's selection by the White House, issued a lukewarm joint response to the nomination: "Before giving someone a lifetime appointment to the federal bench we need to carefully review their record. We will be sure to give Judge Smith's nomination thorough and independent review." Previously, Whitehouse had suggested in September 2007 that the Senate should not consider any Bush appointment for the First Circuit that late in the president's term. Smith's nomination was not confirmed.

The American carrion beetle (Necrophila americana, formerly Silpha americana) is a North American beetle of the family Silphidae. It lays its eggs in, and its larvae consume, raw flesh (particularly that of dead animals) and fungi. The larvae and adults also consume fly larvae and the larvae of other carrion beetles that compete for the same food sources as its larvae.
Range
The beetle lives in North America east of the Rocky Mountains, with its southern boundary from eastern Texas to Florida and the northern boundary from Minnesota to southeastern Canada including New Brunswick and Maine.
Appearance
Adults are 12 to 22 mm long. The pronotum is primarily a pale yellow with a black spot in the center. In the southern portion of the range, the elytra are entirely black while in the northern portion they have a yellow rear tip. The elytra are shorter than the body of the beetle, leaving the tail end slightly exposed. The larvae are black and appear armored.
Lifecycle
From spring through fall, during daylight, a few hours after flies begin arriving at a carcass, the adult beetles will arrive as well. They immediately begin eating the already hatching fly larvae, mating, and laying their own eggs. As long as the carcass lasts, the adults will remain eating competitors to give their own larvae a chance to eat and grow. Upon hatching from the eggs, the larvae will eat both the carcass and other larvae that are within it. Eventually the larvae will fall to the ground, dig into the dirt, and pupate. Overwintering is done by adults.
Mutualism
The beetle is known to engage in mutualistic phoresis with mites of the genus Poecilochirus. Upon arrival at a carcass, these mites drop from the beetle and begin eating the eggs and larvae of the flies that preceded the beetles (and continue to lay more eggs even as the beetles are active). They will eventually return to the adults and be transported to the next carcass. Some of their young will hitch a ride with the beetles' young upon their emergence from the pupal stage.

Kenneth O. May (July 8, 1915, in Portland, Oregon – December 1977, in Toronto) was an American mathematician and historian of mathematics, who developed May's theorem.
May was a prime mover behind the International Commission on the History of Mathematics, and was the first editor of its journal Historia Mathematica. Every four years the ICHM awards the Kenneth O. May Prize for outstanding contributions to the history of mathematics.
Biography
Kenneth was born in 1915, the son of Samuel Chester "Sam" May (1887–1955) and Eleanor Ownsworth Perkin. Their father, an alumnus of the University of Oregon and Yale Law School, practised law in Portland, Oregon beginning in 1913. After earning a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University, Sam in 1920 began teaching political science at Dartmouth College, and later at the University of California, Berkeley.
At the University of California, Kenneth May played was elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior, and studied under Griffith C. Evans. May joined the Communist Party and the Institute of Pacific Relations, of which they served as secretary from 1933. May's mother died in a gas heater explosion at home in 1935. The following year they were granted the A.B. degree and named to the Order of the Golden Bear. In 1937 May was granted a master's degree and was selected by the Institute of Current World Affairs for foreign study. They participated in a Russian seminar and expected to study in Russia, but those plans fell through and they took up study at the London School of Economics.
May was married on July 25, 1938. Their wife, Ruth, had a leave of absence from their school for study at the Sorbonne, so the couple studied there for a year. In 1939 they travelled, including to Moscow where May visited the Kharkov Engineering-Economics Institute. Returning to California, May became a teaching assistant, assigned to mathematics of finance and calculus with analytic geometry.
May's work with the communist party led to alienation from their father and dismissal from their job. The affair received attention nationwide and was featured in a New York Times article. In 1942 they ran for California State Treasurer under the Communist banner. May's associations with J. Robert Oppenheimer were used as evidence in their trial. In World War II May attempted to join up, but until Ruth filed for divorce in June 1942, they could not be drafted. May's unit was sent to Kiska Island in the Aleutian chain. In May 1944, May married Jacqueline Bromley. Their career in the military was recounted on page 4 of Stars and Stripes (Mediterranean Rome) on March 3, 1945.
In 1946 May submitted their thesis, Mathematical Theory of Employment for the Ph.D. They then received a teaching appointment at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. As a protest against the Vietnam War, in 1966 May signed a vow of tax resistance. They moved to Canada the same year.
May is remembered for their Bibliography and Research Manual of the History of Mathematics (1973) published by University of Toronto Press. They made editorial contributions to the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Mathematics. They managed the compilation of an index for the first 80 volumes of American Mathematical Monthly and wrote numerous book reviews. Philip Enros compiled a bibliography of May's writings that was published in 1984.

Marbin is a jazz rock band formed by two musicians from Israel.
History
Markovitch and Rabin met shortly after Markovitch completed their military service as an infantry sergeant and Rabin had graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston.
In 2007, Marbin was founded by saxophonist Danny Markovitch and guitarist Dani Rabin in Israel. After moving to Chicago, they released their first album in 2009. They were asked to join a band led by Paul Wertico, a drummer from Chicago who had been a member of the Pat Metheny Group. Paul introduced Marbin to bassist Steve Rodby, who had also been a member of the Pat Metheny Group, and together they recorded Breaking the Cycle (Moonjune, 2011). Wertico and Rodby appeared as guests on Marbin's next album, Last Chapter of Dreaming (Moonjune, 2013), which was recorded by Markovitch, Rabin, Jae Gentile, and Justyn Lawrence. The same members released a live album, The Third Set (Moonjune, 2014), but the membership changed for Aggressive Hippies (Moonjune, 2014), with Markovitch and Rabin joined by Greg Essig and John Lauler. The band's current line up consists of bassist Jon Nadel and drummer Everette A. Benton, Jr. Marbin released two albums with its prior line up that included drummer Blake Jiracek: Goatman and the House of the Dead (2016) and Israeli Jazz (2018). A new album with the current lineup, Strong Thing, was released on December 1, 2019.
Performing
In addition to their regular schedule playing in top venues and festivals in the U.S., (The Jazz Showcase, Frozen Dead Guy Days, Magic Bag, Gilly's, Andy's Jazz Club, Green Mill, Chicago Jazz Festival), in September 2011, Marbin toured with fusion super group Scott Henderson, Mike Clark, and Jeff Berlin on the east coast and the midwest. In March 2012, Marbin toured with Allan Holdsworth's trio that included Jimmy Haslip of the Yellowjackets and drummer Virgil Donati. In 2013 Marbin played with Wayne Krantz, Tim Lefebvre, and Nate Wood.

"Spidey Super Stories" is a live-action, recurring skit on the original version of the Children's Television Workshop series The Electric Company.
Overview
Episodes featured the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, provided to the Children's Television Workshop free of charge, and was played (always in costume) by puppeteer and dancer Danny Seagren. It premiered during the premiere of The Electric Company's fourth (1974–1975) season, show 391. It predated the pilot film of the series The Amazing Spider-Man by three years, becoming the first live-action rendition of Spider-Man, and was the first live-action rendition of a Marvel character in any medium since the Captain America serial of 1944.
Stories involved the masked superhero foiling mischievous characters who were involved in petty criminal activities, although sometimes the crooks would commit more serious crimes such as assault or larceny. The cast of The Electric Company played the roles of the various characters in each story, with another serving as narrator. In many of these sketches, in keeping with Stan Lee's writing style, viewers were addressed as "true believers".
Unlike other live-action and cartoon productions of Spider-Man, this version of the web-slinging hero did not speak out loud, instead communicating only with word balloons (having a similar role to Clarabell the Clown of Howdy Doody), in order to encourage young viewers to practice their reading skills. Due to the series' budget limitations, comic book panels were interspersed through each skit in lieu of special effects. Aside from Spider-Man himself, no characters from the comic series ever appeared on "Spidey Super Stories".
Theme song
The theme song that plays at the beginning and end of the shorts was written by Gary William Friedman. The lyrics are as follows:
Spider-Man, where are you coming from?
Spider-Man, nobody knows who you are!
Spider-Man, you've got that Spidey touch
Spider-Man, you are a web-slinging star!
Episodes
Approximately one dozen "Spidey Super Stories" segments were produced during The Electric Company's 1974–1975 season, with another twelve or so during the 1975–1976 season, and further episodes during the series' final season.
A 4-DVD boxed set was released by Shout! Factory and Sony BMG Music Entertainment on February 7, 2006, named The Best of Electric Company. It featured 20 episodes from 1971–1977 (D4D 34121), three of which contained Spidey segments.
A second 4-DVD boxed set with 20 shows from 1971–1976 was released on November 14, 2006 (82666-31014). Two of the episodes in this boxed set featured Spidey segments; however, in several of the other episodes, the Spider-Man segments were edited out to minimize the appearance of the character because of rights issues. Episode 60A, from season five, which featured a Spider-Man sketch as the sketch of the day, was altered drastically from the version that originally aired on television.
Another DVD named The Best of the Best of Electric Company, a truncated version of the volume-one boxed set, was released on March 7, 2006 (DD 31006).
1974–75
A number of episodes from season 1 (season 4 of The Electric Company) featured Spidey battling the villain in the screenshot of the comic book cover. Other only had a standard picture of Spidey alone. This is documented in the chart below.

In other media
Comics
From 1974 to 1982, Marvel Comics published a comic book called Spidey Super Stories, which was aimed at children ages 6–10. A total of 57 issues were produced, the first 15 of which were written by Jean Thomas (previously writer of Night Nurse). Jim Salicrup succeeded them as the series writer, and most issues were drawn by Win Mortimer. Thomas and Salicrup remarked that the comic was subject to an exceptionally high level of editorial scrutiny, as staff from both Marvel Comics and the Children's Television Workshop reviewed the stories to ensure they were faithful to the Electric Company and Marvel Comics casts, featured age-appropriate content and reading level and gave significant roles to female characters. Spider-Man signature artist John Romita, Sr. was the Marvel editor of the book and drew some of the covers. During the early years, a comic book version of one of The Electric Company Spidey skits was included. A truncated version also appeared in The Electric Company Magazine. In contrast to the live-action segments on The Electric Company, Spidey often appeared out of costume as Peter Parker.
Every issue of Spidey Super Stories featured at least one story where Spidey would team up with an established Marvel Comics superhero and/or fight an established Marvel villain. This served to introduce other Marvel characters to new readers who were unfamiliar with the company's characters prior to seeing Spider-Man on The Electric Company. Most of these stories would feature quick origins, usually taking up a single page or less, of both the featured hero and villain. Guest heroes included Iron Man, Captain America, Iceman, Doctor Strange, Spider-Woman, Nova, The Cat and Ms. Marvel. Guest villains included the Green Goblin, the Blizzard, Jack O'Lantern, and even Thanos.
Other stories in the issue would feature regular characters from The Electric Company, such as Easy Reader and detective Fargo North, Decoder, with Spidey as a supporting character; conversely, The Electric Company characters would sometimes appear as supporting characters in the Spidey-centric stories. Supporting characters from other Spider-Man comics made regular appearances as well, such as Peter Parker's girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson, and the staff of Parker's workplace, the Daily Bugle, most notably publisher and editor J. Jonah Jameson.
Marvel parodied Spidey Super Stories in a humorous issue of What If...? For two pages, an alternate universe is shown where Marvel had instead teamed up with the National Endowment of the Arts to produce Spidey Intellectual Stories, where Spider-Man defeats the Mad Thinker by debating philosophy. The Watcher notes that it "is for a [yawn] select audience, to be sure".
Record
Spidey Super Stories also appeared as a special vinyl record in the 1970s licensed by Children's Television Workshop to Peter Pan Records. Included on the record are two stories from The Electric Company: "Spidey Versus Mr. Measles" and "The Queen Bee". Other stories include Spidey versus an evil toy-wielding criminal called the Jester in "The Last Laugh", The Purple Pirates and Evil MacWeevil in "The Leader of the Pack" (which includes a cameo of Fargo North, Decoder), and Spidey's origin story. Three other stories feature Spidey with members of the Short Circus, and Pedro and their guard-plant Maurice fighting the Mole Man in "20,000 Feet Under the Ground"; and the group tackling more traditional Marvel Comics villains in "Deadly is the Doctor Called Doom" and "Spidey Versus the Sandman". Due to the lack of a visual presentation, Spidey/Peter Parker would speak with audibly, as voiced by Jim Boyd. However, the album's artwork featured the traditional Spidey-talking technique of having their words in word balloons. Elements such as Spidey's spider-sense and the spider-tracer are used in these stories as well.

Seyed Hossein Hosseini (born 30 June 1992) is an Iranian professional football player currently playing for Esteghlal in the Persian Gulf Pro League and Iran national football team.
Club career
2010–2012: Early career and debut with Bargh Shiraz
Hosseini started their career with Bargh Shiraz. They mostly benched and made just two league appearances in two seasons.
Esteghlal
As summer 2012, Hosseini joined Esteghlal signing a three-year contract. Later in an interview with Navad, they revealed that they declined a huge offer from Persepolis to join the team they supported during their childhood. This claim was later confirmed by Mohammad Rouyanian who was Persepolis' chairperson at the time.
On 9 July 2013, they made their debut in a friendly against Dynamo Kyiv in which they conceded a goal as Esteghlal beat their opponent 2–1. Their first competitive appearance for Esteghlal was in Hazfi Cup against the Caspian Qazvin on 10 December 2013.
2014–16: Loan to Malavan
Hosseini joined Malavan in summer 2014 to complete their mandatory military service. They made their professional debut in 2014–15 Iran Pro League in 1–0 loss against Rah Ahan on 25 August 2014.
2016–17: Return to Esteghlal
After finishing their mandatory service, Hosseini returned to Esteghlal as backup for Mehdi Rahmati. After Rahmati was sidelined for Esteghlal's opening match of the Persian Gulf Pro League season against Naft Tehran due to injury, Hosseini started the match and made their season debut. They finished the season with 8 matches.
2017–18: Record Iranian top division league unbeaten streak
At the beginning of the season Mehdi Rahmati was the first choice keeper, however after failing to win four games out of the first five matches of the season, manager Alireza Mansourian decided to start Hosseini ahead of Rahmati. Hosseini made their season debut in the league on 15 September against Pars Jonoubi Jam in which they conceded 2 goals. They wore the captain's armband for the first time in the next game, on 20 September, in a league match against Zob Ahan. They kept their first clean sheet of the season in a 0–0 draw against Foolad. After keeping a clean sheet on 5 January 2018, they surpassed Alireza Beiranvand's record of 721 minutes without conceding a league goal in Persian Gulf Pro League in a 0–0 draw against Tractor Sazi. On 12 January, they surpassed the record for consecutive minutes in Iranian top division league set by Bahram Mavaddat in 1976 by 28 minutes against Saipa; they set the new all-time record at 872 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal. Reza Asadi finally ended their goalless streak by beating them in the 85th minute of the same match.
Their record is broken by Payam Niazmand in October of 2019. Their performance earned them Navad's player of the month award at the end of January. On 24 February, Hosseini picked up a yellow card for time wasting in a match against Foolad, which ruled them out of the Tehran derby the following week.
International career
Hosseini represented Iran U17 at the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Nigeria. They also represented Iran U20.
They were called to join Iran' training camp by Carlos Queiroz on 3 November 2017. However they did not make into the final squad. On 17 March 2018, they made their official debut as a substitute for Hamed Lak at the half-time against Sierra Leone, which Iran won 4–0 and Hosseini kept a cleen-sheet. In May 2018 they were named in Iran's preliminary squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. They did not make the final 23.
They were called again to join the Iran national football team (Team Melli) by Dragan Skočić on 18 March 2022 for playing against South Korea and Lebanon on March 24th and 29th respectively .
Personal life
Hosseini got married in May 2017. They named Manuel Neuer and Mehdi Rahmati as their role models. Since childhood, they have supported Esteghlal.

Dividend imputation is a corporate tax system in which some or all of the tax paid by a company may be attributed, or imputed, to the shareholders by way of a tax credit to reduce the income tax payable on a distribution. In comparison to the classical system, it reduces or eliminates the tax disadvantages of distributing dividends to shareholders by only requiring them to pay the difference between the corporate rate and their marginal tax rate. The imputation system effectively taxes distributed company profit at the shareholders' average tax rates.
Australia, Malta and New Zealand have imputation systems. Canada, Korea and the United Kingdom have a partial imputation system. Germany had a dividend imputation system until 2000 and France until 2004.
The objective of the dividend imputation system is to collect tax on distributed income at the shareholder's tax rate, in order to eliminate double taxation of company profits, once at the corporate level and again on distribution as a dividend to shareholders. Other jurisdictions which do not have dividend imputation achieve a similar result by only taxing dividends at the shareholder level. For example, Chile has tax integration, and all applicable company profits are taxed only at the shareholder's tax rate, achieving a similar outcome to imputation. Others (Singapore, for example) eliminate double taxation in a different way, by not taxing dividends in the hands of the shareholder and only at the company level. Under this arrangement the shareholders obtain a tax benefit even though the company may not have paid any tax at the corporate level, and it also benefits non-resident shareholders.
Australia
The Australian tax system allows companies to determine the proportion of franking credits to attach to the dividends paid. A franking credit is a nominal unit of tax paid by companies using dividend imputation. Franking credits are passed on to shareholders along with dividends.
Australian-resident shareholders include in their assessable income the grossed-up dividend amount (being the total of the dividend payable plus the associated franking credits). The income tax payable by the shareholders is calculated, and the franking credits are applied to offset the tax payable. In Australia and New Zealand the end result is the elimination of double taxation of company profits.
History
Dividend imputation was introduced in 1987, one of a number of tax reforms by the Hawke–Keating Labor Government. Prior to that a company would pay company tax on its profits and if it then paid a dividend, that dividend was taxed again as income for the shareholder, i.e. a part owner of the company, a form of double taxation.
In 1997 the eligibility rules (below) were introduced by the Howard–Costello Liberal Government, with a $2,000 small shareholder exemption. In 1999 that exemption was raised to the present $5,000. In 2000, franking credits became fully refundable, not just reducing tax liability to zero. In 2002, preferential dividend streaming was banned. In 2003, New Zealand companies could elect to join the system for Australian tax they paid.
Operation
A shareholder's taxable income is grossed up to include the value of the company tax deemed to have been prepaid on the dividend. This value is also credited to the shareholder.
For example, if a company makes a profit of $100 and pays company tax of $30 (at 2006 rates) to the tax office, it records the $30 in the franking account.
The company now has $70 of retained profit to pay a dividend, either in the same year or later years. When it does so, it may attach a franking credit from its franking account, in proportion to the tax rate. If a $70 dividend is paid it could attach $30 of franking credits, and the franking account is debited by $30.
An eligible shareholder receiving a franked dividend declares as income the cash received, plus the franking credit. The franking credit is then credited against the tax payable on their income. The effect is as if the tax office reversed the company tax by giving back the $30 to the shareholder and had them treat the original $100 of profit as income, in the shareholder's hands, like the company was merely a conduit.
Thus company profits distributed to eligible shareholders are taxed in their entirety at the shareholder's rate. Profits retained by the company or distributed to ineligible shareholders remain taxed at the corporate rate.
Dividends may still be paid by a company when it has no franking credits (perhaps because it has been making tax losses), this is called an unfranked dividend. It may pay a franked portion and an unfranked portion, known as partly franked. An unfranked dividend (or the unfranked portion) is ordinary income in the hands of the shareholder.
Refund
A franking credit on dividends received after 1 July 2000 is a refundable tax credit. It is a form of tax paid, which can reduce a taxpayer's total tax liability, and any excess is refunded. For example, an individual with income below the tax-free threshold ($18,200 since 2011/12) pays no tax at all and can get the franking credits back in full, after a tax return is lodged.
Prior to 1 July 2000 such excess franking credits were lost. For example, an individual at that time paying no tax would get nothing back, they merely kept the cash part of the dividend received.
Investors
The easiest way for an investor to value a franked dividend is to think of the franking credit as part of the income they receive. The investor doesn't get it in cash, only as a kind of IOU from the tax office, but nonetheless it and the cash portion make up pre-tax income. Thus a franked dividend of $0.70 plus $0.30 credit is exactly equivalent to an unfranked dividend of $1.00, or to bank interest of $1.00, or any other ordinary income of that amount. (It's exactly equivalent because franking is fully refundable, as described above.)
Franked dividends are often described as a "tax effective" form of income. The basis for this is that the cash $0.70 looks like it's taxed at a lower rate than other income. For example, for an individual on the top rate of 48.5% (for 2006) the calculation is $0.70 plus $0.30 credit is $1.00 on which $0.485 tax is payable, but less the $0.30 credit makes $0.185 net tax, which is just 26.4% of the original $0.70. Conversely, an individual on the 20% marginal tax rate actually gets a $0.10 rebate. In this latter case, the rebate looks very much like negative tax.
There's nothing inherently wrong with the latter way of thinking about franked dividends, and it is frequently made to demonstrate how franking benefits the investor, but it can be argued a grossing-up like the former is better when comparing yields across different investment opportunities.
Eligibility
There are restrictions on who can use franking credits. Those who cannot must simply declare as income the cash dividend amount they receive. The restrictions are designed to prevent the trading of franking credits between different taxpayers. An eligible shareholder is one who either
Owns the shares for a continuous period of 45 days or more (not counting purchase and sale days); or 90 days in the case of certain preference shares. This is the "holding period rule". Shares must be "at risk" for the necessary period, i.e. not with an offsetting derivatives position for instance.
Or who
Has total franking credits for the tax year of less than $5000 (the "small shareholder exemption") and has not arranged to pass-on the benefits to someone else (the "related payments rule").
Thus franking credits are not available to short-term traders, only to longer term holders, but with small holders exempted provided it's for their own benefit.
The small shareholder exemption is not a "first $5000", but rather once the $5000 threshold is passed the rule is inoperative and all one's shares are under the holding period rule.
For the holding period rule, parcels of shares bought and sold at different times are reckoned on a "first in, last out" basis. Each sale is taken to be of the most recently purchased shares. This prevents a taxpayer buying just before a dividend, selling just after, and asserting it was older shares sold (to try to fulfill the holding period).
This "first in, last out" reckoning may be contrasted with capital gains tax. For capital gains the shareholder can nominate what parcel was sold from among those bought at different times.
Company shareholders
A dividend received by a company shareholder is income of the receiving company, but the dividend income is not grossed-up for the franking credit nor is the receiving company entitled to claim the franking credit as a tax credit. Instead, the franking credit is added directly to the receiving company's franking account, and can be paid out in the same way as franking credits generated by the receiving company.
This transfer of credits has made the previous "intercorporate rebates" allowances redundant. Those rebates had avoided double taxation on dividends paid from one company to another company. Those rebates were part of the original 1936 Taxation Act (section 46), meaning that the principle of eliminating double taxation has been present to some degree in Australian income tax law for a very long time.
The company tax rate has changed a few times since the introduction of dividend imputation. In each case transitional rules have been made to maintain the principle of reversing the original tax paid, even if the tax rate has changed. This has been either by separate franking accounts for separate rates (e.g. class A 39%, class B 33%), or making an adjusting recalculation of the credits (e.g. into class C 30%).
Trans-Tasman Imputation
New Zealand companies can apply to join the Australian dividend imputation system (from 2003). Doing so allows them to attach Australian franking credits to their dividends, for Australian tax they have paid. Those credits can then be used by shareholders who are Australian taxpayers, the same as dividends from an Australian company.
There are certain anti-tax-avoidance rules to prevent New Zealand companies deliberately streaming Australian franking credits towards their Australian shareholders; credits must be distributed on a pro-rata basis.
Note that it is only Australian franking credits which can be used by an Australian taxpayer. New Zealand imputation credits on dividends paid to an Australian shareholder cannot be used against that shareholder's Australian taxes.
Abuses of the system
A company is not obliged to attach franking credits to its dividends. But it costs the company nothing to do so, and the credits will benefit eligible shareholders, so it is usual to attach the maximum available. It's actually possible for a company to attach more than it has, but doing so attracts tax penalties that mean this is not worthwhile.
In the past it was permissible for corporations to direct the flow of franking credits preferentially to one type of shareholder over another so that each may benefit the most as fits their tax circumstances. For example, foreign shareholders cannot use franking credits (they can't be offset against withholding tax) but Australian shareholders can. This practice, known as dividend streaming, became illegal in 2002, whereafter all dividends within a given time frame must now be franked to a similar (but need not be identical) degree irrespective of shareholder location or which class of shares held.
Effective elimination of company tax and thus incentives
To a large extent, dividend imputation makes company tax irrelevant. This is because every dollar that a company pays in company tax can be claimed by the shareholder as franking credit, with no net revenue flowing to the government. (There are exceptions which include profits retained by the company that are never paid as dividends, and payments to international investors.)
When gross company tax is reported by Treasury, it is unclear whether the number generally includes the effect of the corresponding franking credits.
One effect is that this has reduced the effectiveness of tax incentives for corporations. If a corporation was given a tax break then its incomes thus released from taxation would not generate franking credits precisely because no tax was paid. In turn, this meant that the shareholders received fewer credits along with their dividends, meaning in turn that they had to pay more tax.
The net result is that each tax break a corporation itself got was countered by a matching increase in the tax burden of shareholders, leaving shareholders in exactly the same position had no tax break been received by the corporation. Thus, to the extent that corporate directors acted so as to increase shareholder wealth, tax incentives would not influence corporate behaviour.
Malta
Malta has a dividend imputation system which is applicable to both resident and non-resident shareholders. The corporate tax rate is equivalent to the top tax bracket and the difference will be applied as a tax credit to the individual via imputation. Where the imputation credits exceed the actual tax payable on the grossed up income, the revenues office will refund the remainder.
New Zealand
New Zealand introduced a dividend imputation system in 1989. It operates on similar principles to the Australian system. A shareholder receiving a dividend from a company is entitled to an "imputation credit", which represents tax paid by the company, and is used to reduce or eliminate the shareholder's income tax liability.
United Kingdom
From 1973 to 1999, the UK operated an imputation system, with shareholders able to claim a tax credit reflecting advance corporation tax (ACT) paid by a company when a distribution was made. A company could set off ACT against the company's annual corporation tax liability, subject to limitations.
In 1999 ACT was abolished. Shareholders receiving a dividend were still entitled to a tax credit to offset their tax liability, but the tax credit no longer necessarily represented tax paid by the company, and could not be refunded to the shareholder. The tax credit was abolished as of 6 April 2016 and replaced with a tax-free dividend allowance of £5,000 (2017/2018). The dividend allowance was reduced to £2,000 from 6 April 2018.

Antoine Mattei (23 March 1917, in Scolca – 31 May 1981) was an officer of the French Foreign Legion made famous by the writings of Paul Bonnecarrère, who published in 1968 Par le sang versé (By the blood shed), the title refers to one of the ways a legionnaire obtains French nationality, and La guerre cruelle (The cruel war) in 1972, which also featured their exploits.  They are a legendary figure of the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment. They published an account of their time during the war in Indochina under the title Tu survivras longtemps (You will survive for a long time). The title is a quote from a poem by Louis Aragon.
They entered the Special Military School of St Cyr in 1938 and graduated with the rank of lieutenant. They participated in the Battle of France during World War II and was imprisoned by the Germans from 1940 to 1945. In 1946, they served in Indochina in the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment until 1952, with the successive ranks of lieutenant and captain.
They were then appointed to SILE, then in a Saharan Company Scope of the Foreign Legion. They served in the 1st Foreign Regiment from 1955 until 1957. They were then a major. They then went from Indochina to Algeria. From 1957 to 1959 they were posted to 4th Foreign Regiment and returned to the 1st Foreign Regiment from 1960 to 1961.
They finally joined the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

A nontransporting EMS vehicle, also known as a fly-car, response vehicle, quick response service (QRS) vehicle, or fast response vehicle, is a vehicle that responds to and provides emergency medical services (EMS) without the ability to transport patients. For patients whose condition requires transport (e.g. to a hospital), an ambulance is necessary. In some cases they may fulfill other duties when not participating in EMS operations, such as policing or fire suppression.
Vehicle types
Non-transporting EMS vehicles come in many sizes and types, from bicycles and golf-carts that can access pedestrian walkways; to motorcycles that are able to fit through stopped or slow traffic; to sedans, station wagons, vambulances (vans), and SUVs that can carry almost as much equipment as an ambulance; to fire engines that carry large crews and may carry specialized equipment. Essentially, any vehicle that lacks the ability to transport a patient may be used, depending on the needs of the local EMS system.
Purpose
A non-transporting EMS vehicle can help emergency medical organizations use their resources more efficiently, assessing an incident's severity (especially where there is reason to suspect the injury or illness is not serious) and either treating the patient at the scene and then releasing them or calling in additional help if required. This saves resources on several levels, as most non-transporting vehicles cost much less than full-size ambulances, and because they may be staffed by a single person (ambulances require a minimum of two crew members: a driver and an attendant). Non-transporting vehicles may be used by supervisors, who may need to move between calls to complete their supervisory duties, or by more highly or specially trained medical providers (e.g. a physician or pain-management technician versus an emergency medical technician), saving those with higher or specialized training from being ensnared in calls that can be capably handled by responders with a more basic level of training.
Non-transporting vehicles can also be used to improve response times. In areas such as busy roads, smaller nontransporting vehicles are able to move through traffic faster than full size ambulances can. Some non-transporting vehicles may also have off-road capabilities, giving them access to areas that traditional ambulances cannot reach. Golf carts and similar vehicles provide access to grassy areas and inside large buildings, such as shopping malls.
Fielding multiple non-transporting vehicles may enable the EMS system to increase the number of units it has available to respond without the greater costs (money and personnel) associated with full-sized ambulances. Adding EMS capabilities to preexisting police cars or fire engines yields similar results.
Examples
Several European countries, such as Germany, Belgium and Austria, with physician-led emergency services, there are Emergency Physician Rapid Response Cars (in German called NEF from Notarzteinsatzfahrzeug — "emergency physician deployment vehicle"), staffed with at least an emergency physician and a paramedic. These physicians are generally only called out to serious calls to coordinate multiple ambulances or provide intense on-scene care to serious or critical patients; paramedics and EMTs in ambulances generally can handle most calls by themselves.
In the Swedish medical system, a non-transporting vehicle (akutbil) can be equipped with a nurse specialized in anesthesia who is specialized in pain management, paired together with a paramedic. These vehicles can be staffed around the clock or during the busiest hours of the day and week in order to augment the capacity of the prehospital care provider and can respond both independently and in conjunction with one or more ambulances, air ambulance(s) and other emergency services. As a result of new (circa 2013) legislation requiring all ambulances to be equipped with at least one trained nurse, non-transporting vehicles have become less common.
In Belgium, a non-transporting vehicle (called Mobiele Urgentiegroep (MUG) in Dutch, Service Mobile d' Urgence et de Réanimation (SMUR) in French) is equipped with at least one emergency physician and one nurse specialized in intensive and emergency care. Standard Belgian ambulances only have EMTs and/or nurses on board and only provide basic life support. Non-transporting vehicles are only sent out for serious emergencies like drug overdoses and cardiac arrests and provide advanced life support on top of the services provided by ambulance crews.
In France, emergency medicine is generally handled by two services, the Fire Department red ambulances which provide basic life support, and Hospital-based yellow or white vehicles who provide advanced life support ambulances and emergency physicians who use fly-cars. In the French model of prehospital care, doctors may remain on scene to attempt procedures to stabilise patients prior to transport.
New York City added EMS capabilities to many of their fire engines, effectively adding dozens of responding EMS units without having to purchase or staff additional ambulances. This practice has spread to many Fire Departments across North America.
Hatzalah in New York City, a Jewish volunteer EMS, runs a two-tiered dispatch model where EMTs and paramedics respond to a call in their fully equipped private vehicles acting as fly cars, while an ambulance is brought for transport if necessary. This allows them to maintain response times of " 2 1/2 to four minutes, compared with the city's 911-dispatched median arrival time of about nine minutes" with many fewer transport units.
Similarly, in Israel, Magen David Adom and other EMS organizations utilize motorcycles as non-transporting EMS vehicles to reach patients.

The 1914 Baylor football team represented Baylor University during the 1914 college football season. In January 1914, a questionnaire regarding a possible conference was sent out to the larger institutions in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. Only Texas A&M failed to express an opinion; all other schools were positive. "No school should be omitted that hasn't the money to keep itself going and be able to play members of the association", Baylor representative C.A. Ganti replied. "This we could not do." In late April and early May, eight institutions met to create the Southwest Conference, to which Baylor was invited and did become a charter member in December of that year. Baylor did not adopt a mascot (the Baylor Bears) until December 14, 1914, after the completion of the 1914 football season.

The former Embassy of Germany in Saint Petersburg is considered the earliest and most influential example of Stripped Classicism. It was built to house the diplomatic mission of the German Empire in Saint Petersburg, the capital of the Russian Empire. After the relocation by the Bolsheviks of the Soviet capital from Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was then known) to Moscow, it served as a consulate of the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany. Located at 11/41 Saint Isaac's Square () in the Tsentralny District of Saint Petersburg, the building now houses the offices of two Russian government agencies.
History of the site
In the 1740s, a two-storey building was erected by Nikita Shestakov on the site which is today at 11/41 Saint Isaac's Square. In 1743 Shestakov sold the building to merchant Fedot Stepanov and from the 1760s to 1812 it was owned by a jeweller to the court of the Russian Empire. From 1815 to 1820, renowned Russian architect Vasily Stasov redesigned the house in the Empire style common in Russia during this period.
In 1832, General-Adjutant Pavel Konstantinovich Aleksandrov, the illegitimate son of Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich, purchased the building and lived there with their wife Anna Alexandrovna. The couple regularly held balls in the residence, with frequent visitors including Alexander Pushkin. The house was passed onto their daughter, Princess Alexandra Pavlovna Lvova, wife of Prince Dmitry Aleksandrovich Lvov, and between 1870–1871 the facade of the building was designed in Eclectic style by Ferdinand Müller.
German Embassy
In 1873, the German Ambassador declared an intention to acquire the building from Princess Lvova and the building was bought by the German Empire for housing the German Embassy to the Russian Empire that same year. The Germans commissioned architect Rudolf Bernhard to redecorate the buildings interiors, and in 1889 Ivan Schlupp redesigned the building by adding a second floor over a part of the facade on Bolshaya Morskaya Street.
In 1911–1913 the building was again redesigned, this time in Neoclassical style by German architect Peter Behrens, as a grandiose monument the power of a unified Germany. Behrens' design, which Albert Speer reported Adolf Hitler admired, saw the facade of the building being built in red granite, the frontispiece, reminiscent of Ancient Greek architecture, was completed with 14 columns, and decorated with pilasters. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe served as construction manager on the project, and sculptor Eberhard Enke created the Castor and Pollux sculpture, symbolising the reunion of the German nation, which adorned the tympanum. Other prominent German masters created paintings, sculptures and fretwork to adorn the building. The Embassy building was officially opened on 14 January 1913.
The artistic community in Saint Petersburg held negative opinions of the building, with prominent members of the community, Alexandre Benois, Nikolay Wrangel and Georgy Lukomsky, criticising the Teutonic style of the building as being hostile to the architectural style of the city, and due to it differing greatly from the Russian neoclassical revival style.
It was rumoured at the time that the Embassy was linked to the German–owned Hotel Astoria via a tunnel, and on 1–2 August 1914, after Germany declared war on Russia, crowds stormed the building as anti-German sentiment took hold in the city. The building sustained considerable damage, with crowds torching the throne room of Kaiser Wilhelm II, destroying Greek and Italian art work and a collection of Sèvres porcelain. The Dioskouroi sculpture from the roof disappeared during this time, and rumours abounded that it was dumped in the Moika River by the crowd, however, researchers have been unable to find any fragments of the sculpture in the river.
After the war, the Germans returned to the city in 1922, at the time known as Petrograd, and operated a consulate from the building, representing the Weimar Republic and later Nazi Germany, until 1939. During the Siege of Leningrad, the Red Army operated a hospital in the premises, and after the Great Patriotic War it housed the Institute of Semiconductor Physics. Later tenants of the building have included Intourist, Dresdner Bank and the Committee for the Management of City Property of the Saint Petersburg City Administration (). Today the building houses the Administration Board of the Ministry of Justice and the Chief Technical Commission to the President of the Russian Federation for the Northwestern Federal District.
Restoration of the building began in 2001, and with the support of Rossvyazokhrankultura and Governor Valentina Matvienko, in a project estimated at 170 million rubles, a group of restorers led by OOO «StroyTREST» are planning to recreate the Dioskouroi sculpture for placement on the tympanum of the building. Plans have been in the works for several years to replace the sculpture, and the warm relations between Russia and Germany have created the right political atmosphere for the restoration of the building to its former glory.

"King of the Clouds" is a song by Panic! at the Disco released on June 18, 2018 as the second promotional single from their sixth studio album, Pray for the Wicked, through Fueled by Ramen and DCD2 Records.
Background and release
"King of the Clouds" was written by Panic! at the Disco's lead vocalist Brendon Urie, Sam Hollander, Jake Sinclair, Alex Kresovich, and Suzy Shinn. Production was handled by Jake Sinclair, Alex Kresovich, and Suzy Shinn. The string section was composed and conducted by Rob Mathes and recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, England.
The song was released four days prior to its parent studio album, Pray for the Wicked, on June 18, 2018 through Fueled by Ramen. A snippet of the song was used at the end of a tour recap video on the band's official YouTube channel on April 18, 2018. "King of the Clouds" made its radio debut on Beats 1 as Zane Lowe's 'Hottest Record in the World Right Now' for June 18, 2018.
In an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1, Brendon Urie explained that the song almost didn't make the album due to timing. Producer Jake Sinclair brought the song to them the day before the album deadline and when Urie heard the track they called it "the dopest song I've ever heard." Citing the last-minute nature of its completion, co-producer Alex Kresovich stated that, “I didn't get the parts I needed to work on until 2:30 a.m. With it due in just a few hours, I was really sweating bullets and just trying to stay awake. We worked until 4:30 a.m. and got everything done and turned in for mixing just in time.”
The lyrical concepts for the song came together during a writing session when Urie got "blitzed out of their mind" and was "verbal vomit(ing)" about "Carl Sagan, the multiverse, and inter-dimensional travel." Unbeknownst to Urie, songwriting partner Sam Hollander was writing down everything they were saying and came back to them with the song idea days later.
In numerous interviews, Brendon Urie cited "King of the Clouds" as their favorite song on Pray for the Wicked and the one they are "most excited to perform live." Urie has described the song as "very Bohemian-esque," noting that it was inspired by "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen, a song the band regularly performs.
Reception
Forbes magazine described it as having "frenetic drumming" and "tasty electronic flourishes" with Urie "flexing their huge vocal range." Billboard described it as similarly "manic" to the album's previous releases.

The Pillow Fight League (PFL) was a Toronto-based semi-professional sports league centred on public pillow fights. The tongue in cheek women's sport was hosted in a fighting arena, much like a boxing or wrestling match. The League was founded by PFL Commissioner Stacey P. Case, and Honorary PFL Commissioner Craig Daniels in February 2004. The formal league launched at a Canadian goth bar called The Vatikan in downtown Toronto. Events were hosted in both Montreal, Quebec and New York City, but the primary seat of the League remained in Toronto, Ontario.
Fights within the League featured either two or three girls, the latter referred to as a damage à trois, and a codified set of rules. Fighters frequently incurred cuts, scrapes and bruises. There were also more serious injuries, including concussions, black eyes, lost teeth, split lips, torn muscles, and bruised kidneys.
The League grew out of a pair of live events held by performers from Canadian burlesque troupe "Skin Tight Outta Sight" at a performance of Mr. Case's band (named for tijuana bibles) at New Year's Eve 2004 and 2005. The latter featured the first instance of live tryouts for members of the audience. The events that followed in 2006 at the Vatikan launched the new League-sponsored series of events primarily focused around the pillow fighting bouts. A potential moneymaker for its founders, the League saw television rights snapped up in 2007 by reality television and sitcom producers Eddie October (executive producer of Tommy Lee Goes to College and The Roseanne Show) and Al Berman (executive producer of The Biggest Loser and Survivor).
The league ceased operation in 2011.

Milton Manor (also Middleton in the 13th century) is a manor house in the parish of Brading on the Isle of Wight, in England.
History
Milton was held with land in Adgestone, of the manor of Appleford for the service of half a knight's fee. The manor was given by Queen Eleanor in 1280 to John de Weston and Christina their wife. John died seised of it in 1323–4, when their son John succeeded. On their death in 1344 the manor passed to their brother William, a clerk in holy orders. In 1346 Katherine de Weston held the manor, and in 1354 Thomas de Weston died seised of it, leaving as their heirs their daughter Eleanor wife of Sir John de Rattlesden, their granddaughters Eleanor and Isabel daughters of another daughter Margaret and their grandson Roger, son of another daughter Isabel. The eldest co-heir Eleanor is perhaps to be identified with Eleanor wife of Sir William Bouchier, kt., who died seised of a quarter fee in Milton in 1397. Them heir was their son William, but John Haket was holding the estate at the end of the 14th century, and was returned for aid in 1428 as holding the de Weston half fee with Henry Howles, the latter being succeeded in the joint holding three years later by John Roucle or Rookley.
In the 15th century the manor seems to have been split up into East and West Milton. East Middleton, the Hakets' portion of the manor, passed with Wolverton, with which it evidently became merged, as the joint holding was known as Wolverton alias Milton from the end of the 16th century onwards. West Milton apparently passed with East Standen to Joan Cooke, who leased it in 1514 to William Howles. The lease, and apparently later the tenancy, of the manor came like East Standen into the hands of the Meux and Bannister families, and in 1573 William Meux sold two parts of West Milton to John Worsley of Appuldurcombe, the remaining third being sold by Sir Edward Bannister in 1616 to Sir Richard Worsley. West Milton thus became united with East Milton, and subsequently followed its descent.

Burgerkill is an Indonesian heavy metal band, originally from Bandung, capital city of West Java. The band is named after the fast food restaurant Burger King as a prank. The band was founded in May 1995 by Aris Tanto a.k.a. Eben, sometimes called 'Ebenz', a young man from Jakarta, who came to Bandung to continue their study. In Bandung, Ebenz met Ivan Scumbag, Kimung, and Dadan. These four personnel became the first line-up of Burgerkill. In 2013, the band won Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards for Metal As F*ck category.
History
1995–2000: Early years and debut album
Burgerkill was formed in Ujungberung region, located in the east side of Bandung city. Ujungberung is not only known as Metal Village, but also known as center of Sundanese traditional art and culture, such as bela diri benjang, angklung, and kecapi suling.
In early 1997, Burgerkill released their first single, "Revolt!", which became the opening track of Masaindahbangetsekalipisan various artist compilation album. In late 1997, single "Offered Sucks" and "My Self" were included in Breathless various artist compilation album. Then in 1998, the single "Blank Proudness" was included in the Independent Rebel various artist compilation album. Since then, Burgerkill has been involved in many underground scenes in Indonesia and Malaysia. In the year of 2000, Burgerkill finally released their first album Dua Sisi under local indie label, Riotic Record. The first 5000 copies of cassette and CD's release were sold out.
In the same year, Burgerkill released single "Everlasting Hope Never Ending Pain" for Ticket to Ride various artist compilation album. This single could be something like a bridge for a new Burgerkill era. Old hardcore bands, such as Youth of Today, Minor Threat, Gorilla Biscuits, and 7 Seconds, etc., are so dominant in Burgerkill early works. In the changing process, Burgerkill transformed into modern metal influences. The sounds were more aggressive, faster beat, and energetic power chord riff with more attractive and interesting guitar fill-in. Burgerkill's new sounds style revealed in their second album.
2001–2004: Berkarat
Burgerkill became the first Indonesian metal band to sign a six-album contract for Sony Music Entertainment. At the end of 2003, they released their second album, Berkarat. It was chosen as "Best Metal Production" at the 2004 Indonesian Music Awards. With their new label, Burgerkill had some negative response from Indonesia metal scene, but they noticed the reason behind joining major label because of the label gave them the freedom to choose any kind of music they want to play. Not only free to choose the style of music but also the concept, lyrics, and also music video style. To Tembang, they stressed that the important thing was the freedom of music expression itself, no matter if a band in indie-line or in a major label line.
Technically the second album is more progressive than the first one. There is almost none of the straight forward nuance of their first album. In the vocals, they remain settled with depressive dark nuance. Ivan Scumbag, the vocalist, being more expressive to articulate the song, which, all tracks of the album are written in Indonesian, Burgerkill's native language. In this second album, Burgerkill collaborated with Fadly of Padi in "Tiga Titik Hitam" song.
In 2004, Burgerkil released Dua Sisi repacked.
2005–2010: Beyond Coma and Despair
Burgerkill began to work their third album material in early 2005, at the same time, Toto, who have been with Burgerkill as drummer for nine years long decided to depart from the band. They reformed the line-up with Andris, who at the time played bass, on drums; while the bass work was done by a session player.
In November 2005, Burgerkill finished writing the album, but their deal with Sony was breaking down. Both sides couldn't reach an agreement about the album material. Burgerkill decided to leave the label to release their third album under their own label, Revolt! Record, in August 2006.
In the days waiting to release their third album, the vocalist Ivan Scumbag died because of inflamed brain disease. Beyond Coma and Despair, the title of their third album, has become some kind like Scumbag's personal reflection. To honor their past vocalist and friend, Kimung, the group's original bassist and Ivan Scumbag's childhood friend, released a biographical novel based on Ivan Scumbag's life in late 2007. The book which titled My Self : Scumbag, Beyond Life and Death was officially released and supported by Minor Book as publisher and "Common Room" as venue holder. About 300 people, consisting of Ivan Scumbag's friends, family, and fans along with some journalists, attended the memorial where the book was discussed, people spoke about Ivan Scumbag their life along with a short acoustic set from the band.
Among the critics, Beyond Coma And Despair was utterly different from their past albums with heavier sounds and more explicit lyrics. The album was included in The 150 Greatest Indonesian Albums of All Time, listed at number 113 by Rolling Stone Indonesia magazine.
In the aftermath of Ivan Scumbag's death, Vicky joined the band after chosen in audition. In 2009, the band toured in Australia under title "The Invasion of Noise Western Australia" tour. Following the "Invasion of Noise" tour, Burgerkill performed alongside such bands as DevilDriver, In Flames, Lamb of God, and All That Remains as part of 2009 Soundwave in Perth. In 2010, they appeared in Big Day Out.
2011–2017: Venomous
Venomous was revealed around late 2009, to Samack of Jakartabeat Eben told that their new album not too far different from their past one, Beyond Coma and Despair. Eben and their fellow band member felt that the new material album has new progress in each musical line. European bands such as Gojira, Hacride, Meshuggah, and Lyzanxia are main influence to them to create a heavier middle beat style. And the old North America-based band such as Megadeth, Slayer, Monstrosity, Cannibal Corpse, Pantera, and Anthrax are still become main inspiration in working on song emotion and the structure. In the vocals session, the band mostly refer to Devin Townsend, Mark Hunter, Björn Speed, etc. The band new vocalist, Vicky, according to Eben has a strong vocals distortion. So why Eben revealed their optimism to Samack in working on their new album material.
Just few weeks after "Allegiance 2 Metal" tour across Java Island along with technical death metal band, Psycroptic, Burgerkill released Venomous in Indonesia around June 2011, Malaysia around July 2011 and Australia around August 2011. Venomous is their first album under Xenophobic Record label and Firestarter Music as distributor. Venomous according to Eben has significantly differences from their past album, not only music but also lyrics. Burgerkill's music style always changes from one album to the next one, but the lyrics in past album remained segmented in a certain theme or topic. That's why Eben said the albums before Venomous are just alike Ivan Scumbag legacy. In the past albums, Ivan had dominant writing to the lyrics, then in the postdecease of Ivan, all Burgerkill man agreed to discuss about the lyrics material to their next albums. In this case Eben little disagreed to people who compared Vicky to Ivan Scumbag. Eben said those two man have different background.
"If Ivan said their life was miserable, yeah, they were right, they were miserable man..", said Eben. "We don't want to write the lyrics about the thing that we never feel, see, or experience", Eben stressed their words to explain their new lyrics theme, and let the fans have opinion about Beyond Coma and Despair and two albums before as Ivan Scumbag's legacy, especially the mostly dark and distrust lyrics.
The Venomous launching concert which titled "Venomous Alive" was held in Jakarta at Bulungan Outdoor with opening act band from the capital city such as Nemesis, Paper Gangster, and Dead Vertical. For the bigger one concert, "Venomous Alive" took place in Siliwangi Stadium, Bandung and attended more than 10.000 of their die-hard fans, along with Man Jasad, and Arian of Seringai as opening act and guest performer. Beside these two Indonesia major cities, "Venomous Alive" also rock on other major and minor city across Java Island and other city outside the island, such as Makassar, South Sulawesi.
Venomous regionally was well received. British magazine Metal Hammer and also Heavy Magazine described Venomous as slightly technical death metal with many riffs. The magazine also wrote if someone took equal parts from Morbid Angel, Obituary, Sepultura, and Killswitch Engage, and they or they should have Burgerkill. In the magazine opinion many other bands like that, but the magazine also praised Burgerkill's unique in the face military style has them attacking each song with such ferocity and intensity that they or they will take notice. In June 2013, Burgerkill won the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards for "Metal As F*ck" category.
2018–present: Adamantine
On 20 April 2018, the band released their fifth album Adamantine. The album was planned to be released in 2015 marking their 20th anniversary but was postponed due to the tight schedule and personnel changes. Adamantine consists of nine tracks, including a cover version of Iwan Fals' song "Air Mata Api". Adam Rees of Louder gave the album 4 stars out of 5, writing "Adamantine is a genuine world-beater, light years ahead of its predecessor in terms of production, songwriting craft and sonic impact." Metal Hammer included the album in their list of 50 Best Metal Albums of 2018.
To introduce their latest album, Burgerkill toured seven cities in Europe and six cities in America. The tour runs from October to November 2018.

The 2019–20 Liga IV was the 78th season of the Liga IV, the fourth tier of the Romanian football league system. The champions of each county association play against one from a neighboring county in a playoff to gain promotion. This had to be the third season when the counties were divided into 7 regions, each consisting of 6 counties and the draw was made on 15 February 2019, with 4 months before the first matches.
In the spring of 2020, most of the county leagues were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 11 May 2020, the Romanian Football Federation announced that the promotion format will be changed, especially due to the fact that no team (apart from the teams that were already excluded or dissolved) relegated from Liga III. The promotion play-off system was changed from 21 two-legged matches in 14 groups of 3 teams, the winners of the groups and the best 7 ranked runners-up will be promoted to the third tier, 14 teams instead of 21. The groups will be played on neutral ground.

John Austin Meyer (St. Marys September 18, 1919 - Pittsburgh January 28, 1997) was an aerial photographer in the US Army Air Forces during World War II and a professor of Nuclear and Radiation Chemistry.
Life
Meyer was born in St. Marys on September 18, 1919. In Saint Mary's Catholic High School they participated in camera club continuing into the towns camera club, and at the age of 21 they worked as a photographer and pursued studies in chemistry.
Meyer enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps on March 18, 1941. After basic training in Langley Field, Virginia they were assigned to Dow Field, Bangor, Maine. After initially being put off by the army because they couldn't bring their photographic equipment, they're befriending Corporal Busch who got promoted to Sergeant, and helped Meyer into the photography department. Meyer had a four-month training program in aerial photography at the Air Force Photo School in Denver, then assigned to the US base at Gander, Newfoundland in August 1942 as chief photographic officer.
Among other aerial photographers in Gander, their work helped create the first aerial mapping and photographic studies of cloud formations taken by the Air Corps in the area. They also assisted in anti submarine spotting patrol and other classified flight missions.
After being discharged in 1955, Meyer enrolled at Pennsylvania State University and received a bachelor's degree and masters in chemistry and worked as an analytical research chemist at Gulf Research and Development Company.

Yapton Free Church (also known as Yapton Evangelical Free Church) is an Evangelical church in the village of Yapton in West Sussex, England. The "pretty flint building" dates from 1861, when it was built for a group of Congregational worshippers who had been active in the area for several years. Growth in membership during the 20th century meant that by the 1990s some services and activities were held in larger premises elsewhere, but the chapel remains registered as a place of worship. The church is denominationally independent but is associated with a worldwide cross-denomination network of churches called Partners in Harvest. The church building has been listed at Grade II by Historic England for its architectural and historical importance.
History
Protestant Nonconfirmists were attested locally in the 17th century: the Compton Census of 1676 found six living in the parish. People associated with Independent polity and with Congregationalism were meeting for worship in the village possibly as early as 1830, and certainly by 1846 when a room was registered for their use. This was succeeded either by a new chapel in 1848 on the site of the present building, or a different meeting room elsewhere in 1850. In its early days, the cause was associated with Trinity Congregational Church in nearby Arundel, which carried out missionary work in the village in the 1840s. A Sunday school was formed by 1851. The present chapel, with a Sunday school building attached at right-angles, was built in 1861 and funded by Henry Bateman. The Congregational church at nearby Littlehampton supported the cause in its early years, and in 1865 it was recorded that the minister came from there. A resident minister, living in a house next to the chapel (demolished in the 1970s), was in place by 1886.
From 1973 the church adopted an Evangelical identity and became known as Yapton Evangelical Free Church. By 1991 services were taking place in Yapton and Ford Village Hall because congregations were too large for the chapel. The church is now associated with the Partners in Harvest network, founded in Canada in 1994, which works with independent churches of various denominations across the world.
The church is registered for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855; its number on the register is 14693. With the name Congregational Chapel it was registered for the solemnisation of marriages in accordance with the Marriage Act 1836 on 20 October 1887.
Architecture and heritage
Yapton Free Church is an -shaped building consisting of the chapel and an attached schoolroom. It is a "pretty" building with walls of flint, mostly galleted, with some brickwork and stucco-faced ashlar dressings. The chapel itself, whose original internal fittings had been removed by the 1980s, has a two-bay façade with a gable and porch. The side elevations have round-headed windows. There is a second entrance on the inner side of the where the schoolroom joins. This has a single-storey three-bay façade; the projecting centre bay is also gabled and has a wider arched window; the other windows are narrow single-light openings.

This is a list of Sheriffs of Merionethshire (or Sheriffs of Meirionnydd). The historic county of Merioneth was originally created in 1284. The administrative county of Merioneth was created from the historic county under the Local Government Act 1888.
A Sheriff is the legal representative of the monarch, and is appointed annually for each county in Wales and England. Their duty is to keep the peace in the county, and to ensure the country follows the law of the monarch. Originally, the job was a position of status and strength, but today it is principally a ceremonial role.
On 1 April 1974, under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972, the shrievalties of Merionethshire, together with that of Anglesey and Caernarvonshire were abolished, being replaced by the new office of High Sheriff of Gwynedd.

The Lion-Peugeot Type V2Y2 was an early motor car produced near Valentigney by the French auto-maker Lion-Peugeot in 1910. It closely resembled the manufacturer's Type V2C2, but it had a larger engine and was faster. 300 V2Y2s were produced.
The V2C3 was propelled using a two-cylinder 1,702 cm³ four-stroke engine, mounted ahead of the driver. This was the largest two-cylinder engines that the manufacturer produced. A maximum 16 hp of power was delivered to the rear wheels.
The car shared its 2,250 mm wheelbase with the manufacturer's single cylinder Type VC2. The 3,200 mm body length provided space for between two and four people depending on the body specified. The range of different body types offered included a Phaeton, a Torpedo, a Limousine, a Landaulet, and a sports car.
The V2Y2 was built during the year of the formal merger of Lion-Peugeot with the “Automobiles Peugeot” business of Armand Peugeot. By this time, apart from the much smaller Peugeot Bébé, the part of the business that before the merger had been known as “Automobiles Peugeot” was producing no car with engines smaller than 2,000 cm³: this shows the extent to which, by this time, the two Peugeot family automobile manufacturers were producing complementary ranges.
Lion-Peugeot and Peugeot: the difference
“Lion-Peugeot” is the name under which in 1906 Robert Peugeot and their two brothers, independently of their cousin Armand's "Automobiles Peugeot" company, established a car manufacturing business at Beaulieu near Vallentigny. Ten years earlier the automobile pioneer Armand Peugeot had split away from the family business after a long-standing disagreement over how intensively the company should diversify into larger scale automobile production. An agreement had at that time been entered into between Armand's “Automobiles Peugeot” company and the residual Peugeot business that the residual business should concentrate on its established metal tools and components businesses along with its successful bicycle manufacturing activities, while Armand would have Peugeot branded powered vehicles to himself. During the ensuing ten years Armand's automobile business had grown rapidly, although it appears that the residual Peugeot business had probably not entirely avoided producing powered vehicles. In any event, under a new agreement signed in 1905, the residual Peugeot business made Armand an annual payment in return for which Armand consented to the residual business itself producing motor cars under the “Lion-Peugeot” name. The arrangement continued until 1910 after which (the death of Robert Peugeot's father Eugène having apparently removed a major impediment to the idea) the Lion-Peugeot business and the Peugeot automobiles business were merged into a single company. Nevertheless, some smaller models continued to be branded as “Lion-Peugeots” until 1916.

After school, they joined the Law firm Honey and Blackenberg, where they became the youngest partner by the age of 26. Biti lost their father in their early 30s.
Political career
In 1999 they helped found the MDC. They were elected Member of Parliament for the Harare East constituency in 2000. During the Fifth Parliament they served as a member of the Parliament Portfolio Committee on Lands, Agriculture, Water Development, Rural Resources and Resettlement and that on Defence and Home Affairs. In March 2005 they retained the constituency. They serve in the Portfolio Committee on Budget, Finance and Economic Development and is currently the MDC's Secretary General. In their legal career Biti has handled labour and human rights litigation representing large trade unions such as the Post and Telecommunications Trade Union.
They were arrested in 2007 with many others, including MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, after a prayer rally in the Harare township of Highfield.
On 16 June 2007, Biti and Welshman Ncube met with Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa and Labor Minister Nicholas Goche, in Pretoria, South Africa. South African President Thabo Mbeki, appointed by the Southern African Development Community, presided over the negotiations which sought to end sanctions on Zimbabwe top ZANU-PF leaders or top government officials.
2008 elections
Biti was re-elected to the House of Assembly from Harare East in the March 2008 parliamentary election. According to official results, they received 8,377 votes against 2,587 for the ZANU-PF candidate. In the period following the election, they stayed outside of Zimbabwe (mainly in South Africa), along with Tsvangirai, amidst a post-electoral situation that was marked by serious violence against MDC supporters.
Arrest
Biti returned to Zimbabwe on 12 June 2008 and was immediately arrested at the airport in Harare. Before their departure from Johannesburg, Biti said that they had already learned that they would be arrested, but maintained that their only crime was "fighting for democracy" and said that it was necessary for them to return to participate in the MDC's struggle. Following Biti's arrest, police spokesperson Wayne Bvudzijena said that they would be charged with treason, based on an MDC document about changing the government. This document, which was called "The Transition Strategy" and was said to have been written by Biti on 25 March, included purported plans to rig the election in favour of the MDC. Bvudzijena said that Biti would additionally be charged with making false statements "prejudicial to the state" due to their announcement of election results prior to their release by the Electoral Commission. United States Ambassador James McGee expressed deep concern on behalf of the US government, saying that the document in question was an unobjectionable statement of the MDC's plans and goals; according to McGee, another, more extreme version of the document existed, but it was forged. Biti's lawyer also claimed that the material in question was forged.
On 13 June, Biti's lawyers said that they had not been allowed to meet with him, and they filed an urgent application with the High Court on the same day. The MDC said that it was "deeply worried" about Biti's welfare and that it had sent a team to police stations across Harare, hoping to determine where they were being held. They appeared in court on 14 June.
Biti's home was searched by the police on 16 June, although the police did not take anything out of the home. Their lawyer, Lewis Uriri, said that Biti had been interrogated for a full 24 hours after their arrest; Uriri also said that they would seek an order from the High Court to release Biti on the grounds that they had been held without charge for more than the allowed 48-hour period.
Biti again appeared in court on 18 June; however, this hearing was postponed to the next day because the power failed, meaning that the hearing could not be recorded. They were charged on 19 June. They faced four charges: "treason, communicating falsehoods prejudicial to the State, insulting President Mugabe and causing disaffection among the defence forces".. Prosecutors argued against granting bail to Biti, noting that the charges against them were so serious that they could be executed. The defence submitted an application to have the charges thrown out, but on 20 June magistrate Mishrod Guvamombe dismissed this application, saying that they believed there was "reasonable suspicion that the accused committed the said offence". Biti's next court appearance was set for 7 July, and Guvamombe ordered that they remain in custody until then.
On 26 June, Biti was granted bail at one trillion Zimbabwean dollars; they were also required to surrender their home's title deeds and to report to the police on a weekly basis. Biti's lawyers later filed a petition asking for the return of their passport so that they could attend talks between the parties in South Africa, and as a result their passport was returned to them on 9 July, enabling them to go. They led the MDC-Tsvangirai delegation to the talks, which began in Pretoria on 10 July, although according to Tsvangirai the purpose of this was only to set the MDC-Tsvangirai's conditions for participating in the talks, not to actually participate in them.
Uriri applied for the removal of Biti's remand on the grounds that a trial date should have been set and the police investigation should have been completed. On 27 August 2008, Chioniso Mutongi, a magistrate in Harare, rejected this request, saying that Biti had not been on remand long enough for its removal to be appropriate.
In 2018 following Zimbabwe's disputed elections, they were arrested and denied asylum in Zambia.
Appointment to Government of National Unity
On 10 February 2009, MDC leader and Prime Minister-designate Morgan Tsvangirai announced the appointment of Biti as Finance Minister in the Government of National Unity. Though they have no known history in financial and economic matters, analysts suggest that Tsavingarai really had no other option considering Biti's position in the MDC. In addition, they are known to drive a hard bargain and could be the best person to deal with the Zanu-PF controlled public service. They were sworn in alongside other Ministers on 13 February 2009 in Harare.
Return to legal career
On 20 November 2013, Biti announced they would be opening a new law firm. The firm was to specialize in international finance law as well as domestic constitutional issues.
Return to politics
Biti fell out with Tsvangirai in 2014, resulting in Tsvangirai announcing Biti's expulsion in April 2014. In 2015 Biti joined other disaffected MDC-T members in a breakaway group, MDC-Renewal, becoming its secretary-general. In September 2015, MDC-Renewal launched as a separate party, the People's Democratic Party, and Biti was elected president of the new party.
In 2020, Biti criticized a three-member delegation from South African which was sent to investigate human rights abuses when they returned to their country without speaking to opposition groups.
In February 2019 they were convicted of contravening the Electoral Act for illegally announcing purported results for the 2018 presidential election in Zimbabwe. They were fined $200.
In February 2022, Tendai Biti, was detained by police for several hours while campaigning for the by-elections in Harare, a spokesperson for their party said.

The Garden Company Limited () is a Hong Kong-based bakery and confectionery manufacturer. The company was one of the first Chinese owned businesses created to sell modern-style food products in the territory. They also made bread and confectionery more affordable for lower-income earners.
History
Founded in 1926 by cousins Tse Fong Cheung and Wah O. Wong in Kowloon with a single bakery. The company's name is named after the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens.
Garden is traditionally a Chinese company and supplied bread to the Chinese army during World War II. The firm closed operations during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong from 1941 to 1945. The company expanded with the growth of Hong Kong before and after World War II and benefited from the influx of immigrants. In the 1956 riot Garden Bakery's Kowloon factory was destroyed and the colonial government awarded it HK$743,000 in compensation in 1957.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Garden products were shipped overseas to Chinese communities around the world.
Today, the company remains family (Cheung family) owned with several joint ventures with other Chinese firms. It is one of few Hong Kong firms with operations still in Hong Kong.

St Joseph's College is a former Roman Catholic seminary and boarding school in Up Holland, Lancashire, England. The foundation of the original building was laid in April 1880 and the college opened in 1883. The buildings have since been deconsecrated.
History
St Joseph's College was founded in 1880 by Bishop Bernard O'Reilly to be the Seminary serving the North West of England. On St. Joseph's Day, 19 March 1880 Dr. O'Reilly blessed and laid the foundation stone of the new college.
The Liverpool Mercury dated 19 April 1880 gives an account of this event:
Construction of a new wing was financed by Gilbert Hayes, "a Citizen of Liverpool, sometime Illustrious Professor of Veterinary Art", who donated £17,000. Progress on the project was described in The Tablet on 11 March 1882:
The college was formally opened in 1883 and was situated in Walthew Park, Up Holland, the geographic centre of the Diocese of Liverpool.
The first Junior Seminary of the Diocese was founded at St Edward's College in 1842 as a Roman Catholic "classical and commercial school" under the direction of the secular clergy and was established in Domingo House, a large house in Everton. Its president for the next forty years was Monsignor Provost John Henry Fisher. When the junior seminarians moved to St Joseph's in 1920, the school was taken over by the Christian Brothers, who also ran St John Rigby College in nearby Orrell, and now serves as the Liverpool Cathedral Choir School. In recognition of the heritage owed to St Edward's College, one of the two chapels at Up Holland was consecrated as the St Edward the Confessor Chapel.
St Joseph's, usually referred to by its students simply as "Up Holland", was one of two main seminaries serving the north of England. Up Holland served the northwest and Ushaw College the northeast. For many years, each of these institutions housed both a junior (minor) and a senior (major) seminary. The junior seminaries provided a secondary education in a semi-monastic environment to boys aged 11–18 who wished to pursue the priesthood, while the senior seminaries trained adult candidates, mostly aged between 18 and 24, in philosophy and theology, preparing them for the priesthood. A detailed account of daily life in the junior seminary at Up Holland during the 1960s, Boys of the Cloth, was published in 2012. This also explores the reasons why the Church's traditional form of seminary training may have predisposed some priests to molest children, which was one of the key findings of a major investigation conducted on behalf of American bishops into the causes of the sexual abuse crisis within the Catholic Church in the United States.
Although Up Holland flourished until the 1960s, the rapidly changing social climate in that decade led to a sharp drop in enrolment. In the early 1970s, the northern bishops decided to consolidate the activities of Up Holland and Ushaw; from 1972 all junior seminarians in the north attended Up Holland, and from 1975 all senior seminarians attended Ushaw. Even as the sole junior seminary for the north of England, however, Up Holland continued to suffer a decline in numbers, and by the 1980s it was no longer described as a traditional junior seminary but as a "boarding school for boys considering a vocation".
In 1986, the total number of students was down to 82, of whom only 54 were Church students, and it was no longer considered viable to educate them on the premises. From 1987, the remaining students continued to live at Up Holland but for classes attended St John Rigby College in nearby Orrell, an arrangement that continued until the last of these students left Up Holland in 1992.
In the meantime, following the move of the senior seminary to Ushaw, in 1976 the former Senior Seminary rooms had become the home of the Up Holland Northern Institute (UNI), with Father Kevin Kelly as its first Director. They were succeeded in 1980 by Father Vincent Nichols, now Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster. Later, the College buildings were used more generally as a retreat and conference centre for the Archdiocese under the leadership of Monsignor John Devine. A short video tour of the College, derived from footage taken a few months before its closure as a conference centre, highlighting the functions played by different parts of the building during the seminary days, is available online.
The election of Patrick Kelly as Archbishop of Liverpool in 1996 saw the controversial decision to close St Joseph's altogether, and the property was sold for development to Anglo International, who instructed AEW Architects for the conversion of the Grade 2 listed buildings into 92 apartments, with 220 new build "enabling" units. The major controversies of the decision were the ongoing financial viability of St Joseph's, which had just started to make a small surplus under Devine's management, and the sale and disposal of the art and artefacts in the college, much of which had been donated by various parishes and people of the Archdiocese, who were not offered their donations back.
Since that time, as photographic essays from urban explorers attest, the building has fallen into extensive dereliction, with water ingress and at least one collapsed roof.
Gradwell Collection
This collection, entrusted to Liverpool Hope University on the closure of St. Joseph's College at Up Holland, contains material covering the following subjects: theology, philosophy, church, secular and local history, ecclesiastical history, art, architecture, sociology, education and works of general reference.
It includes recusant works and early printed works. Donations and subscriptions aside, the book collection has not been added to since 1975, however, the journal and periodical collection, which is mainly theological, has been kept up to date. The collection is particularly strong in Roman Catholic studies, with standard works of reference and extensive runs of Catholic periodicals and journals of use to all levels of research.

James Ivan Roland (December 14, 1942 – March 6, 2010) was an American professional baseball relief pitcher. They played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, and Texas Rangers.
Roland entered the majors in 1962 with the Minnesota Twins, playing for them six years (1962–64, 1966–68), before joining the Oakland Athletics (1969–72), New York Yankees (1972) and Texas Rangers (1972). A starter converted to long relief duties, they possessed a hard fastball and a dominant curve, but their delivery was bothered by control problems for most of their career. Their most productive season came in 1969, when they posted career-numbers in wins (five), earned run average (2.19), games (39) and innings pitched (). After that their career declined due to a nerve problem in their throwing arm, pitching a combined 23 innings for Oakland, New York and Texas in 1972, their last major league season.
Their only career shutout was at the expense of the Chicago White Sox, 3–0, at Comiskey Park on April 21, 1963. They gave up three singles on nine walks and seven strikeouts. On May 19, 1964, they defeated the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, 7–2, pitching 12 innings and facing 50 batters, in a victory where they went up against a lineup which included Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle, Elston Howard, Tom Tresh and Bobby Richardson.
In a 10-year career, Roland went 19–17 with a 3.22 ERA and nine saves in 216 pitching appearances, including 29 starts, six complete games and one shutout, giving up 185 runs (161 earned) on 357 hits, while striking out 272 and walking 229 in innings of work. In four minor league seasons, they had a 32–42 record with a 3.48 ERA in 111 games.
Roland died from cancer in Shelby, North Carolina, at the age of 67.
