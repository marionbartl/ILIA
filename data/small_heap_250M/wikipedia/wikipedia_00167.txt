Eastside Spirit and Pride (ESSP) is a club in East Los Angeles College, founded by Dennis Sanchez. The club is involved in East Los Angeles College, and has made contributions to the school and the surrounding community.
Mission of the Organization
The mission of ESSP is to assist students of East Los Angeles College to realize their potential and successfully transfer to four-year universities. ESSP raises funds to create scholarship for students. In addition ESSP has established an irrevocable sense of pride in the school and in the greater community, focusing on East Los Angeles. In addition, ESSP seeks to instill a strong sense of self-esteem in students who have had to overcome great obstacles to attend college.
History of the Club and Its Contributions to East Los Angeles College
Professor Dennis Sanchez, an alumnus of the University of Southern California and San Francisco State University found his occupational satisfaction in coming to East Los Angeles College and serving as an English professor because he wanted to give back to the community. He felt that students in ELAC were equally diligent as students at other community colleges, yet they were compelled by their circumstances to overcome much more adversity and sorrows. Therefore, he established East Side Spirit and Pride so that students of the college could develop a veracious sense of pride in their community and heritage.
East Side Spirit and Pride was a major advocate for the restoration football team at ELAC when football had been eliminated due to budgetary constraints.
Professor Sanchez along with the East Side Spirit and Pride members instigated the idea of the creation of a marching band,
which could help pervade a sense of high-spirits and joy regarding East Los Angeles College. ESSP collaborated with the President of the college, Ernest Moreno, for the achievement of this objective, making ELAC, one of only three colleges in the entire state of California with a marching band during the time. To this day, the marching band has played an integral role in the atmosphere of the college and regularly performs during special occasions, such as football games and the annual commencement ceremony.
East Side Spirit and Pride Today
Today, East Side Spirit and Pride involves dozens of students, faculty, and staff every semester. In addition, ESSP has a board of directors of nineteen members most of whom are former ESSP members as well as graduates of East Los Angeles College. The club holds regular meetings on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. ESSP also regularly features motivational speakers, generally former students of East Los Angeles College who have now graduated from four year universities and sometimes local celebrities, including Chase Masterson, actress, Luis J. Rodriguez, a Mexican-American native of East Los Angeles and famous author of the book Always Running: La Vida Loca, Gang Days in L.A., and congresswoman Judy Chu both honored at ESSP's annual scholarship dinner.
The club also routinely hosts tours to various neighboring universities, such as Cal State Dominguez Hills, Cal State Fullerton, Cal State Los Angeles, UCLA, USC, Occidental and Loyola Marymount University, where students have the opportunity to frequent campus grounds and explore possible options for their higher education.
East Side Spirit and Pride also has weekly readings, known as Great Moments in Literature, where professors and students read and openly discuss and analyze the meanings of various literary works, many by renowned authors and poets such as Robert Frost, Ernest Hemingway, Emily Dickinson, William Shakespeare, and E. A. Robinson.
The club also has interactive and informative discussions concerning procedures and important things-to-know relating to transferring to four-year universities in California, primarily the UCs, CSUs, and private universities such as USC.
The club consists of over fifty members, a board of directors of nineteen members, an associate board, a faculty/staff committee as well as chapters of trustees throughout Southern California. The club has welcomed UCLA graduate and English professor Nancy Ramirez as co-sponsor of the club. Also joining ESSP are parents and players from West Hills Baseball, CA, who have partnered to help with the ESSP scholarship dinner and golf tournament to help raise funds for ELAC students.
On March 15, 2014, a fundraising event will be sponsored by East Side Spirit and Pride, featuring special guest, Edward James Olmos, alumni of East Los Angeles College and Academy Award nominee for his role in Stand and Deliver.
Partnership with Homeboy Industries
In 2010, East Side Spirit and Pride partnered up with Father Greg Boyle and Homeboy Industries in an attempt to reach out to the surrounding community. Professor Dennis Sanchez teaches a class called Bridge to College at Homeboy Industries on a routine basis in addition to having ESSP members tutor members of Homeboy Industry. In addition he takes members from Homeboy Industries on tours to East Los Angeles College and other colleges in the Los Angeles area. As a result, many students from Homeboy Industry have enrolled at East Los Angeles College and other community colleges in the greater Los Angeles area. Proceeds from the ESSP Annual Scholarship Dinner and its lunch and golf tournament go to fund educational scholarships and grants for members of Homeboy Industries and other at-risk members of the community.

Karen Cries on the Bus () is a 2011 Colombian drama film written and directed by Gabriel Rojas Vera. It premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on 16 February 2011.
Plot
Karen, a housewife in her late thirties, leaves her troubled marriage and moves into a cheap room in crumbling neighborhood where she tries to start a new life. Unskilled, she is unable to find work. Her troubles only increase when her purse is stolen with all her money, forcing her to beg for money at bus stops and shoplift from grocery stores. Her mother and her husband both try to convince her to give the marriage a second chance, but she would rather be on her own.
Karen's new friend Patricia introduces her to a playwright with whom she begins a relationship. Karen is offered a job at a bookstore where she had applied much earlier, but before she can begin work her new boyfriend informs her that he's been offered a job in Argentina and he wants her to join him there. She accepts, and in doing so turns down the job at the bookstore. But before they leave, she realizes that the move would keep her from living her own life as she intended, and she chooses not to go.
The film ends with Karen riding on the bus, still uncertain of the future, but content to finally be living on her own terms. As she gets off the bus, another woman gets on, destitute and crying, just as Karen had done at the start of the film.

St. Stanislaus Parish is a Catholic parish of the Diocese of Manchester, located in Nashua, New Hampshire, United States.
The first parish at the site was established in 1908 for Polish immigrants by Bishop George Albert Guertin. The current parish was founded in 2016 by Bishop Peter Anthony Libasci and dedicated to observing the Tridentine Mass and other liturgical rites in use prior to Vatican II.
History
Polish-American parish
St. Stanislaus Parish was founded in 1908 as a Catholic parish designated for Polish immigrants. It was one of the Polish-American "national parishes" in the Diocese of Manchester.
Polish immigration to New Hampshire began in the years 1854-1870, and increased from 1870 to 1910. According to a parish history produced in 1958, early Polish immigrants in Nashua worshipped at Immaculate Conception Church, the first parish in the city, a predominantly Irish-American church on Temple Street; it was later renamed St. Casimir Church around 1910. An organization of lay people, named for Polish king Jan III Sobieski, was founded in March 1907, and petitioned Manchester bishop George Albert Guertin for a parish church of their own. Five petitioners created a civil corporation for the purpose of "building and maintaining a church of the Roman Catholic denomination" under the name "Polish Church of St. Stanislaw" on September 26, 1907. The request was approved by Bishop Guertin on April 19, 1908, giving the parish the title St. Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr, in honor of the eleventh-century Stanislaus of Szczepanów.
The parish's first pastor, Rev. John Mard, was only able to serve three months due to poor health. His successor, Rev. Francis Taborski, succeeded in raising $5,000 to buy a property on Franklin Street. Construction of the church started in early 1909 and finished before the end of the year. Pews for the church were purchased from a former Free Will Baptist church a few blocks away.
During the pastorate of Rev. Louis Wojtys from 1910 to 1915, the church was dedicated, a hall was built to house a parish school and community events, and eight acres of land were bought in 1914 for a cemetery.
In 1927, Bishop Guertin entrusted the parish to the Missionaries of La Salette. The new pastor, Fr. Joseph Piszczalka, M.S., who served at St. Stanislaus from 1926 to 1948, set to work renovating the church and rectory: the parish installed electricity in the church and the hall, finished paying its mortgage (1927), and began work on its parish cemetery. A school was begun in 1929. In the parish's 25th anniversary year, 1933, it numbered over 1000 individuals and 190 families.
Starting in 1938, a group of Felician Sisters was assigned to the parish to provide religious instruction to the children, and also taught the Polish language.
During World War II, almost 200 young people from the parish served in the United States armed forces. Eight died in service, and the parish honored them in 1945 by erecting a chapel and monument in the St. Stanislaus Cemetery.
Merger
The parish was unified with St. Aloysius of Gonzaga Parish in 2002, and the sacramental records of the Polish-American parish were transferred to St. Aloysius of Gonzaga Parish. After the merger, St. Stanislaus Church remained open as a eucharistic adoration chapel staffed by Missionary Sisters Servants of the Word. A food bank also was established in the church basement.
Personal parish for traditional liturgy
On May 20, 2016, Most Reverend Peter A. Libasci, the Bishop of Manchester, announced that a new St. Stanislaus Parish would be established at the church, entrusted to the care of the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter and dedicated to the celebration of the Tridentine Mass. Services of the new parish community began in August 2016.

She made her anime voice acting debut as Ricca Morizono in Da Capo III. She made an appearance at the Bangkok Comic Con in July 2014.
Career
In September 2014, she had her debut as a solo singer with the release of her first single.
In February 2015, Nitta's talent agency announced she would be suspending activities for two months to receive treatment for her vocal cord polyps. She returned to work mid-April after non-invasive treatment.
In 2016, Weekly Asahi Geinou ran an article accusing Nitta of appearing in an ?????? prior to her voice acting debut, due to similarities in looks and the placement of certain moles between Nitta and the AV actress in question. In response, S-inc published a statement denying Nitta's involvement. Nitta's weekly livestream Nico Nico broadcast Emint Night was also postponed.
Personal life
Nitta was born in Nagano Prefecture. As well as singing, she also plays the piano. Her hobbies include visiting cafes, karaoke, and studying dinosaurs.

In Māori mythology, Rūaumoko (also known as Rūamoko) is the god of earthquakes, volcanoes and seasons. He is the youngest son of Ranginui (the Sky father) and Papatūānuku (the Earth mother) (commonly called Rangi and Papa).
Ruaumoko Patera, named after this god, is one of many paterae (shallow craters) on Io, one of Jupiter's moons.
Mythology
After Rangi and Papa were separated by their sons, Rangi cried, and his tears drenched the land. To stop this, the sons decided to turn Papa face down, so Rangi and Papa could no longer see each other's sorrow. Rūaumoko was at his mother's breast when this happened, so he was carried into the world below. He was given fire for warmth by Tama-kaka, and his movements below the earth cause earthquakes and volcanoes. Another version tells that he remains in Papa's womb, with some variants saying it was to keep Papa company after her separation from Rangi. In these versions, his movements in the womb cause earthquakes.
The earthquakes Rūaumoko causes are in turn responsible for the change of seasons. Depending on the time of year, the earthquakes cause the warmth, or cold, of Papa to come to the surface of the land, resulting in the warming, or cooling of the Earth.
Rūaumoko pulls on the ropes that control the land causing the shimmering effect of hot air, called haka of Tane-rore, and in some versions, earthquakes.
Rūaumoko is also known as husband of his niece Hine-nui-te-pō, the goddess of death and a daughter of Tāne.
In some traditions, Rūaumoko creates the Auckland volcanic field alongside his brother Mataaho, in retribution for a war between two rival tribes of patupaiarehe.

The vascular cambium is the main growth tissue in the stems and roots of many plants, specifically in dicots such as buttercups and oak trees, gymnosperms such as pine trees, as well as in certain other vascular plants. It produces secondary xylem inwards, towards the pith, and secondary phloem outwards, towards the bark.
In herbaceous plants, it occurs in the vascular bundles which are often arranged like beads on a necklace forming an interrupted ring inside the stem. In woody plants, it forms a cylinder of unspecialized meristem cells, as a continuous ring from which the new tissues are grown. Unlike the xylem and phloem, it does not transport water, minerals or food through the plant. Other names for the vascular cambium are the main cambium, wood cambium, or bifacial cambium.
Occurrence
Vascular cambia are found in all seed plants except for five angiosperm lineages which have independently lost it; Nymphaeales, Ceratophyllum, Nelumbo, Podostemaceae, and monocots. A few leaf types also have a vascular cambium. In dicot and gymnosperm trees, the vascular cambium is the obvious line separating the bark and wood; they also have a cork cambium. For successful grafting, the vascular cambia of the rootstock and scion must be aligned so they can grow together.
Structure and function
The cambium present between primary xylem and primary phloem is called the intrafascicular cambium (within vascular bundles). During secondary growth, cells of medullary rays, in a line (as seen in section; in three dimensions, it is a sheet) between neighbouring vascular bundles, become meristematic and form new interfascicular cambium (between vascular bundles). The fascicular and interfascicular cambia thus join up to form a ring (in three dimensions, a tube) which separates the primary xylem and primary phloem, the cambium ring. The vascular cambium produces secondary xylem on the inside of the ring, and secondary phloem on the outside, pushing the primary xylem and phloem apart.
The vascular cambium usually consists of two types of cells:
Fusiform initials (tall, axially oriented)
Ray initials (smaller and round to angular in shape)
Maintenance of cambial meristem
The vascular cambium is maintained by a network of interacting signal feedback loops. Currently, both hormones and short peptides have been identified as information carriers in these systems. While similar regulation occurs in other plant meristems, the cambial meristem receives signals from both the xylem and phloem sides for the meristem. Signals received from outside the meristem act to down regulate internal factors, which promotes cell proliferation and differentiation.
Hormonal regulation
The phytohormones that are involved in the vascular cambial activity are auxins, ethylene, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and probably more to be discovered. Each one of these plant hormones is vital for regulation of cambial activity. Combination of different concentrations of these hormones is very important in plant metabolism.
Auxin hormones are proven to stimulate mitosis, cell production and regulate interfascicular and fascicular cambium. Applying auxin to the surface of a tree stump allowed decapitated shoots to continue secondary growth. The absence of auxin hormones will have a detrimental effect on a plant. It has been shown that mutants without auxin will exhibit increased spacing between the interfascicular cambiums and reduced growth of the vascular bundles. The mutant plant will therefore experience a decrease in water, nutrients, and photosynthates being transported throughout the plant, eventually leading to death. Auxin also regulates the two types of cell in the vascular cambium, ray and fusiform initials. Regulation of these initials ensures the connection and communication between xylem and phloem is maintained for the translocation of nourishment and sugars are safely being stored as an energy resource. Ethylene levels are high in plants with an active cambial zone and are still currently being studied. Gibberellin stimulates the cambial cell division and also regulates differentiation of the xylem tissues, with no effect on the rate of phloem differentiation. Differentiation is an essential process that changes these tissues into a more specialized type, leading to an important role in maintaining the life form of a plant. In poplar trees, high concentrations of gibberellin is positively correlated to an increase of cambial cell division and an increase of auxin in the cambial stem cells. Gibberellin is also responsible for the expansion of xylem through a signal traveling from the shoot to the root. Cytokinin hormone is known to regulate the rate of the cell division instead of the direction of cell differentiation. A study demonstrated that the mutants are found to have a reduction in stem and root growth but the secondary vascular pattern of the vascular bundles were not affected with a treatment of cytokinin.
Cambium as food
The cambium of most trees are edible. In Scandinavia, it was historically used as a flour to make bark bread.

Porous is a village in Manchester, Jamaica that overlooks a plain to the south, with hills behind it to the north. A tributary of the Rio Minho runs parallel to the main road, helping to keep the atmosphere cool.
History
Porus was founded in 1840 by the missionary James Phillippo as a free village for ex-slaves following emancipation. It was his sixth such village. It was originally called Vale Lionel after the then Governor of Jamaica, Sir Lionel Smith, but was soon renamed "Porous" most probably after the porous soil in the vicinity. It was described as a “small estate” on the journey from Savanna-la-Mar to Kingston taken by M.G. Lewis, a plantation owner, in 1817.
In its early days, its population was very small although it boasted a large coffee market. It is now a thriving community of predominantly small farmers and artisans.
Thomas Albert Samuel Manley, father of Norman Washington Manley, one of Jamaica's National Heroes, was born in Porus in 1852.
Transport
Road
Porus is on the A2 road which runs from Spanish Town in south central Jamaica to Savanna-la-Mar on the south west coast.
Rail
From 1895 to 1992 Porus was served by Porus railway station on the Kingston to Montego Bay line. Although all services on the line have ceased, the extensive (for Jamaica) station buildings remain.
Future generations are hoping to rebuild these services better than ever.
Public amenities
There are seven schools, (Porus District of churches) churches, a post office, a police station, a comprehensive health clinic, and various small retail outlets.

The 1st constituency of Charente-Maritime (French: Première circonscription de la Charente-Maritime) is one of five electoral districts in the department of the same name, each of which returns one deputy to the French National Assembly in elections using the two-round system, with a run-off if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in the first round.
Since 2012, the constituency has been represented by Olivier Falorni, first as a Miscellaneous Left deputy and then as a deputy for the Radical Party of the Left. The constituency covers the city of La Rochelle and the Isle of Rhé.
Description
The constituency is made up of 11 pre-2015 cantons: those of Ars-en-Ré, La Rochelle-1, La Rochelle-2, La Rochelle-3, La Rochelle-4, La Rochelle-5, La Rochelle-6, La Rochelle-7, La Rochelle-8, La Rochelle-9, and Saint-Martin-de-Ré.
At the time of the 1999 census (which was the basis for the most recent redrawing of constituency boundaries, carried out in 2010) the 1st constituency had a total population of 130,679.

New Brighton is a township in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. It forms part of the greater township of Ibhayi and the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality which governs Port Elizabeth and its surroundings.
History
It was established in 1902, and was the first officially black residential area in the greater Port Elizabeth area. Prior to the establishment of New Brighton as the first black township, there was a demolishing of the then Black residential area in 1902 where the personal belongings of the Black residents were arbitrarily destroyed, and restrictions imposed upon their travel outside the demarcated area. The racially segregated township of New Brighton was established in 1902 on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth, some 8 km north of the city centre, to house families who had been forcefully removed in the previous years.
. Many of Athol Fugard's plays are set in New Brighton.
As part of the governing modus-operandi of the Colonial Government of the 19th century, that would eventually lead to the Land Act of 1913 a decade later, where policy was formulated on the basis of ethnicity, townships, including that of New Brighton, were established for the exclusive use of Black residents who were not housed by employers, and who could not afford to purchase property in the suburbs. In 1855, Stranger's Location, known as Emaxambeni in isiXhosa was established. Stranger's Location spilled over into Cooper's Kloof in the 1860s and became a separate municipal location in 1877. The Reservoir Location off Mount Road was established by the Municipality in 1883. The largest privately owned township, Gubbs Location, was established in the 1860s.
A case of bubonic plague in Gubb's Location in 1901 set in place events that led to demolition of these townships and the creation of New Brighton. Port Elizabeth recorded a total of 105 cases - 21 Whites and 84 Blacks - of bubonic plague in 1901. This was the direct result of Argentinian fodder and horses being imported into South Africa by the British military during the South African War.
After the first case was reported, the residents from the various townships agreed to meet. During the meeting it was agreed that a single township outside Port Elizabeth had to be built. Following recommendations from public health officials, demolished houses number 325 in Port Elizabeth and 950 in the Stranger's location, The Reservoir Location and Gubb's Location townships in 1903. The establishment of New Brighton was facilitated by the Colonial Government's purchase of the farms known as Cradock Place and Deal Party for the sum of £20 000. The portion set for the establishment of New Brighton was situated north of Port Elizabeth in area which was deemed unsuitable for industrial use. The choice of a site for New Brighton outside the town's boundaries was determined by favourable health conditions in the area, and the fact that it would allow for effective residential segregation. These were on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth, far away from the city centre and white suburbs where New Brighton residents were employed. In its very early days, Port Elizabeth was planned in a manner that did not allow for different races to mix and this was spelt out as such in colonial policy and regulations. White and Coloured people, even though New Brighton was established as an exclusively Black township, flouted Government rules and built homes in New Brighton, albeit only a few. By the year 1911, New Brighton's population had grown to 3,650 persons, almost all of them Black, this compromising of 52 Whites, 3414 Black Africans and 184 Coloureds. The oldest and iconic location within the New Brighton area is the Red Location, which was developed in 1902-1903, and made up of corrugated iron shacks which were built in a barrack-type fashion.
Accommodation for individuals in New Brighton was allotted on a first-come, first-served basis. The Government initially planned to rehouse only about 1 500 people in the Location even though estimates suggested that about three times that number of Africans resided in Port Elizabeth and slum areas, and that a similar number lived outside the municipal boundaries. Huts were erected in this order: one and two-bedroomed family accommodation for 'ordinary native labourers' and 'civilised natives' also known as Class A and B, and dormitories for 'single men' called Class C. Rents in New Brighton of between 20s. and 30s. per month for family quarters and 8s. per month for single quarters (Class C). At the end of 1903 the population of New Brighton was 2 125. Some residents from the demolished townships of Stranger's location, The Reservoir Location and Gubb's Location refused to move to New Brighton and opted for Korsten. In Korsten, they could own land. By January 1910, the population of New Brighton had reached 3156.
New Brighton today
Today, New Brighton is made up of many more locations namely White location, Elundini, KwaFord, Boast Village, Masangwanaville and Chris Hani informal settlement, amongst others. New Brighton is also popular for the sons and daughters it birthed, who would go on to be prominent anti-apartheid activists and leaders of post-apartheid, democratic South Africa. Amongst the prominent South African people born and bred in New Brighton include actor and playwright Ken Gampu, John Kani, Nomhle Nkonyeni, ANC stalwart Vusi Pikoli and Black Consciousness co-founder Barney Pityana. As such, the first cell of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the ANC, was set up in New Brighton. Some of the prominent names in the South African art scene today – a new generation following those mentioned above – that were also born and bred in New Brighton include poet Mxolisi Nyezwa and dramatist-playwright Mzwandile Zwai Mgijima. Many of the historic places that served as cultural and political hubs in New Brighton and Port Elizabeth at large in the 1960s have either been demolished or changed to suit contemporary needs. Notable amongst these include the former Rio Bioscope, opened in 1950 on Aggrey Road, is today being used as a church by the Cathedral Church of Umzi Wasi Topiya, naming it Kaizer Ngxwana after the anti-apartheid struggle stalwart. The Red Location Museum is one of the main tourist attractions.

St. John the Evangelist Church is a parish of the Roman Catholic Church in Center City, Philadelphia, within the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. From 1838 to 1864 it served as the cathedral for the diocese. The historic Gothic Revival parish church, completed in 1832, is located just south of Market Street on 13th Street, a little more than a block from Philadelphia City Hall.
Since 1991, it has been staffed by the Capuchins, a Franciscan order, though for most of its history it was served by diocesan priests. The current pastor is Father John Daya, OFM Cap.
Activities
One of the more active parishes in Philadelphia, St. John's offers Sunday Masses at 8:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. (along with a Saturday evening Vigil Mass at 5:15 p.m.) in the upper church. It also offers three Masses each weekday in the lower church, at 7:45 a.m., 12:05 p.m., and 5:15 p.m., serving the numerous shoppers and an estimated 200,000 workers in the dense Center City area. At one time, in an effort to serve a special population, it even had a Mass at 2:45 a.m. on Sundays for workers leaving their businesses at that time, called the "Printers' Mass," because of the many newspaper printing plants nearby.
It is also one of the few local parishes to offer confession on multiple days during the week, usually from 3:30 p.m. to 4:45 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays and on the vigil days for weekday holydays. This extensive sacramental schedule is offered even though the current number of homes registered in the parish is only 821 (due to the largely commercial nature of the surrounding area).
The weekly church bulletin (with special schedules and listings of other events) is online.
History
Founding
The charter for the parish was granted on December 27, 1830, the feast of St. John the Evangelist, by the Bishop, Francis P. Kenrick, to the Rev. John Hughes, although the location for the church was not chosen until the following year. The church finally was consecrated on Passion Sunday (April 8) in 1832. The interior of the church, at the time (it was since damaged twice by fire), included a fresco painted by Nicholas Monachesi, who became renowned as a local portrait painter and, in 1834, the United States premiere of Mozart's Requiem Mass was held at the church. It was later that year, on August 1, that the first fire on the block occurred.
Cathedral and Nativist Riots
In 1838, the church was designated as Philadelphia's Proto-Cathedral and the bishop took up residence in the rectory. [The previous cathedral, from 1810 to 1838, was Old St. Mary's Church at 4th and Locust Streets.] In 1844 the Nativist Riots, in which several dozen people were killed, broke out. After two Catholic churches (St. Michael's and St. Augustine's) were destroyed, General George Cadwalader placed cannon near the cathedral to protect it and the disturbances did not damage the church.
In the 1850s, two future saints were connected with the parish; Katherine Drexel received first communion and was confirmed at the parish while John Neumann, Bishop Kenrick's replacement when he was named Archbishop of Baltimore, arrived to become bishop on March 30, 1852; as bishop he lived in the parish (then the cathedral) rectory.
At this time (1855–1860), the Jesuit order took over administration of the parish when the pastor entered the Jesuit order. In 1864, the current cathedral, the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul on Logan Circle, was named the diocesan cathedral and St. John's again became an ordinary parish. During St. John's time as cathedral, Philadelphia had 170,000 Catholics.
Fire of 1899
In February, 1899, the church was burned in a fire which destroyed much of the block where it was located, and there was also damage to the rectory. Three firemen died when the building collapsed atop them and a fourth died later of pneumonia, contracted while battling the blaze in the February weather. A Mass to pray for them was held later that month in the Academy of Music, since the upper church was unusable. In recent years, an annual Mass for this purpose is held each year.
Later in 1899, the parish school was moved out of the basement area of the church which was converted to a lower church for the celebration of the Sacraments while the main (upper church) was repaired.
International ties
The original pastor, Fr. Hughes, became close friends with a parishioner who had lived in Mexico for several years and, through him, ties with that country and people from it endured for many years. Not only was there financial support from Mexican merchants living in Philadelphia, but, when the exiled Mexican Emperor Augustín de Iturbide was executed by Santa Anna upon his return in 1824, his family moved to Philadelphia and his widow, ex-Empress Ana Maria Huarte de Iturbide, is buried in St. John's Churchyard Cemetery, along with some other members of her family. During the anti-religious persecution in the 1920s, the Sisters of the Visitation were expelled from Mexico and lived on the church property at St. John's for several years, before moving to their current monastery site.
In 1939, Bishop Yu Pin urged the Chinese community to connect with the parish; ultimately hundreds did and a chapel (later renamed Holy Redeemer Church) was opened about six blocks away from the main church in the heart of Chinatown, where it still operates.

Homaledra sabalella, the palm leaf skeletonizer moth, is a moth in the family Pterolonchidae. It is found in North America, where it has been recorded from Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. It is also present in Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and Cuba.
Taxonomy
Homaledra sabalella was described as Laverna sabalella by Vactor Tousey Chambers in 1880. It was included in the family Coleophoridae by Ron Hodges in 1983. Hodges then moved it to the subfamily Batrachedrinae of the Batrachedridae in 1999. In 2014, a cladistic analysis performed by Heikkilä et al., which led them to decide it was better to reclassify the genus in the family Pterolonchidae.
Description
The wingspan is about 18 mm. Adults mature and are active year-round.
Ecology
The larvae feed on Sabal palmetto, Sabal causiarum and Cocos nucifera. They feed on the palm fronds.

Travellingua, also known as the Language and Culture Explorers' Club, is a project which was supported by the European Commission under Socrates Lingua 1 (Promotion of Language Learning) action.
The project was implemented from November 1, 2006 to September 30, 2008.
Outputs
The official website (www.travellingua.eu) has 5 main parts:
LEARN: A linguistic part with the Phrase book and audio material in 5 languages (English, Lithuanian, Latvian, Danish and Swedish);
EXPLORE: a part which gives basic information about 4 countries, their cultures and languages (Lithuania, Latvia, Denmark and Sweden);
SHARE: a part where the material (phrase book and MP3 files) can be downloaded for free and learners share their knowledge and experience in language learning and travelling;
CONSULT: a linguistic part where any learner can ask a general question about language learning or a specific language (Lithuanian, Latvian, Danish or Swedish) and get a professional answer from a linguist. Answers then are posted for the general public;
CONTINUE STUDIES: a part which gives useful links (with free linguistic resources, EU-sponsored linguistic projects are presented among them) for those who decide to continue self-studying Lithuanian, Latvian, Danish or Swedish or to find more information about travelling.
Results
As a result of this project:
there will be more people having survival-level linguistic competence of the target languages and being able to use it while travelling or working abroad;
there will be more people self-studying other European languages (especially from the Germanic group);
less popular European countries and languages will be promoted.

Naval career
Lincoln graduated from the Naval Academy in 1896, having been trained as a naval engineer. He ranked second in his class and received his first assignment by request of the captain of the USS Philadelphia. He was awarded the Navy Cross for his conduct as captain of the USS Powhatan on convoy duty during World War I.
Lincoln served on the United States Shipping Board advisory board during the 1930s, and also at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. During WW I, he saw active duty in command of a supply ship in the Atlantic. After the war, as a Commander, Lincoln was department head of Electrical Engineering and Physics at the Naval Academy. In 1943, he was called back to active duty to take command of the Naval Ammunition Depot Fallbrook, California.
Governorship

The 1972 Liberty Bowl was a college football postseason bowl game played on December 18, 1972, in Memphis, Tennessee. In the 14th edition of the Liberty Bowl, the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets defeated the Iowa State Cyclones, 31–30.
Background
The Cyclones finished 5th in the Big Eight Conference, after falling from 8–4 to 5–5–1 in their second straight bowl appearance. The Yellow Jackets were in a bowl for the third straight year under first year head coach Bill Fulcher. This was the first Liberty Bowl for both teams. The game was nationally televised in primetime on ABC.
Game summary
An Iowa State fumble led to a Cam Bonifay field goal to make it 3-0 Georgia Tech less than two minutes into the game. Iowa State responded with two touchdowns in the first quarter, one of them on a George Amundson touchdown pass and the other on a Moses Moore touchdown run. Jimmy Robinson caught a touchdown pass from backup quarterback Jim Stevens to make it 14-9 midway through the second quarter. Gary Faulkner returned an interception for a touchdown to make it 17-14 with 1:46 remaining in the 1st half. But on the ensuing kickoff return, Moore returned it 93 yards for a touchdown to make it 21-17 at halftime. Rob Healy caught a touchdown pass from Stevens to make it 24-21 Georgia Tech. Iowa State responded with a Goedjen field goal with 1:40 remaining in the third to make it a 24-24 tie going into the final quarter.

On a pitchout pass attempt by Stevens, the Cyclones recovered the ball at the Jacket 33 with the chance to tie/win. An Ike Harris touchdown from George Amundson had made it 31-30 with 1:36 to go. But on the ensuing two-point conversion, Amundson threw the ball away, and Mark Fields recovered the ensuing onside kick for Georgia Tech to clinch the game. Jim Stevens completed 12 of 15 passes for 157 yards and three touchdowns and was named Most Valuable Player.

Andreas Bornemann (born 15 September 1971) is a German former footballer and current official. Since 1 July 2019, he has been the Sporting director of FC St. Pauli.
Playing career
Bornemann was born in Neuenburg am Rhein. He joined SC Freiburg in 1988 from his hometown club FC Neuenburg. Playing mainly for the club's amateurs, he also made six Bundesliga appearances and 2. Bundesliga appearances on the professional team between 1991 and 2000.
Managerial career
From 2000 to 2002, Bornemann headed the Freiburger Fußballschule. Under his Patronage, the old Möslestadion was converted into Freiburger Fußballschule for an investment of € 12 million. On 21 February 2002, he succeeded the outgoing manager Andreas Rettig, who then went to 1. FC Köln. At the end of the season, SC Freiburg was relegated to the 2. Bundesliga, where Bornemann remained manager from then on. After the dismissal of coach Volker Finke, he was replaced by Dirk Dufner in June 2007. He then succeeded Jörg Schmadtke as Sports director on 3 January 2009 at Alemannia Aachen until the supervisory board gave him leave on 29 November 2009.
Bornemann became Sports director of Holstein Kiel on 2 February 2010 and held this position until the summer of 2014. On 21 May 2014, second division club SpVgg Greuther Fürth announced Bornemann's commitment as sporting director. However, SpVgg Greuther Fürth announced on 27 June 2014 that Bornemann could not take the job for personal reasons. Later, media reports triggered by Bornemann's statements made it known that Bornemann had been working at SpVgg Greuther Fürth since 1 June to prepare for his new position, but resigned after three weeks due to differences with the presidency.
On 21 September 2015, 1. FC Nürnberg announced that Andreas Bornemann would succeed Martin Bader as sporting director. There he was dismissed in February 2019 for defying the board of directors. At this time, 1. FC Nürnberg was in 18th place in the table.

Frans Pourbus the Younger (1569–1622) was a Flemish painter, son of Frans Pourbus the Elder and grandson of Pieter Pourbus. He was born in Antwerp and died in Paris. He is also referred to as "Frans II".
Pourbus worked for many of the highly influential people of his day, including the Brussels-based Spanish Regents of the Netherlands, the Duke of Mantua and Marie de' Medici, Queen of France. Works of his can be found in the Royal Collection, the National Museum in Warsaw, the Louvre, the Prado, the Rijksmuseum, the Royal College of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and many other museums.
Style
Pourbus was best known for portraits, but created some history paintings. He produced portraits that were pleasing to his patrons, but rarely providing his works with dramatic situations, or even landscape backgrounds. He is noted for his depiction of costume, jewellery and draperies, as in his portrait of Henry IV of France (below).
Patronage
Pourbus completed his apprenticeship in Antwerp in 1591. At the end of the 16th century, he worked for Archduke Albert and the Infanta Isabella in Brussels. On 27 June 1600, he was paid for a portrait of the Infanta (see below). This was subsequently presented to Anne of Denmark (wife of James VI and I) by the Ambassador of the Spanish Netherlands and this work remains in the Royal Collection.
In 1600, he was recruited as court painter in Mantua by Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua who met him when Gonzaga was on a visit to the Netherlands buying works of art. Within months of his appointment, Peter Paul Rubens arrived at the Mantuan court, but there is no evidence of hostility between the two. In 1609, Pourbus moved to Paris at the instigation of Marie de Médici (see her portrait below). It was here that he perfected his style. He worked as Marie de Médici's court painter until his death.
Death
He died in Paris and was buried on 19 February 1621/2. The exact date of his death is unknown.
The "Anne Boleyn" portrait
Among his works is a portrait of an Italian lady in the Pinacoteca Malaspina, Pavia that has been incorrectly identified as Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII of England (see below). This identification is a result of a later inscription. The portrait was in any case painted some years after Anne Boleyn's death in 1536.

Mount McDuffie is a 13,291-foot-elevation (4,051 meter) mountain summit located west of the crest of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, in Fresno County of northern California, United States. This peak is situated in Kings Canyon National Park, northwest of The Citadel, and two miles south of Black Giant, which is the nearest higher neighbor. McDuffie ranks as the 93rd highest summit in California, and the second-highest point on Black Divide. Topographic relief is significant as it rises nearly 4,900 feet (1,493 meters) above Middle Fork Kings River in approximately 2.5 miles. An approach to this remote peak is made possible via the John Muir Trail.
History
This mountain's name honors Duncan McDuffie (1877–1951), to commemorate his interest in the national parks and his work as a conservationist. He was also an accomplished mountaineer in the Sierra Nevada, having made first ascents of Mount Abbot, Bear Creek Spire, and Black Kaweah. Along with James S. Hutchinson and Joseph Nisbet LeConte, he pioneered a high alpine route in 1908 from Yosemite National Park to Kings Canyon, roughly along the route of what would become the John Muir Trail. He served as President of the Sierra Club from 1928 to 1931, and again from 1943 to 1946. The name was officially adopted in 1953 by the United States Board on Geographic Names.
The first ascent of the summit was made July 23, 1951, by Charles Bays Locker, Karl Hufbauer, and Alfred Elkin via the north ridge.
Climbing
Established climbing routes:
North Ridge – – First ascent July 23, 1951
Southeast Ridge – class 2-3 – July 15, 1952, by Charles Bays Locker, Karl Hufbauer, Don Albright, Gary Hufbauer
Northwest Slope and West Ridge – class 3 – August 1971, by Dave Gladstone
West Chute – class 3 – August 2, 1974, by Bob Rockwell
Southwest Ridge – class 2 – August 10, 1989, by Dave Helphrey, Ron Robson, Reiner Stenzel
Climate
Mount McDuffie is located in an alpine climate zone. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Sierra Nevada mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the range (orographic lift). Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into tributaries of the Middle Fork Kings River.

Dunford Bridge railway station was a railway station that served the village of Dunford Bridge on the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway situated immediately east of the Woodhead Tunnel, west of Penistone, within the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England.
The station was east of Manchester London Road (now Manchester Picadilly) and west of the now closed Sheffield Victoria station.
History
When the line over Woodhead was opened in 1845 the tunnels were incomplete and a stagecoach service operated from here over the hills to the station at . Because the turning space at was inadequate the stagecoach links in the Huddersfield direction via Holmfirth were also operated from here.
The station was opened on 14 July 1845 and consisted of two flanking platforms, the main, stone built structure, with booking office and staff accommodation was on the Manchester-bound (Down) platform, whilst the Sheffield-bound platform (Up) had a large water tower alongside a stone built waiting shelter. Immediately east of the station was access to sidings which served stone quarries.
The area was controlled from a signal box positioned near the road bridge at the west end of the station but this was replaced by a larger cabin, of the late Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway design, immediately east of the station buildings, on the up platform.
This station was replaced by a modern structure in 1954 when the line was electrified. Still with flanking platforms but now realigned with the line through the "new" Woodhead Tunnel the main building was still on the down platform with a simple waiting shelter on the up.
The station was closed with the passenger services on the line on 5 January 1970.

Steenbek-Projensdorf is a district of Kiel located in the northwestern part of it, about five to ten kilometres outside of the city centre.
Infrastructure
Since the 1960s many people have moved to Steenbek-Projensdorf so that in the 1970s and the 1980s the quarter started to look more city-like. There is a shopping centre including a bank, a travel agency and restaurants. Furthermore there are dormitories, a retirement home, churches, and a gymnasium.
One of the most important new buildings of Steenbek and Kiel, the Lubinus-Klinik, was finished in 1984. Today it is a big medical centre.
Area
Origin
The area of Steenbek-Projensdorf used to exist within the natural borders next to the areas of Suchsdorf and Klausbrook; the borders passed the edge of the Projensdorfer Gehölz (=Projensdorf Wood) on one side and both sides of the Bremerskamp up to the Olshausenstraße on the other side.
Today
Today Steenbek-Projensdorf is bounded by the Olof-Palme-Damm between Suchsdorf and Steenbek-Projensdorf, furthermore by the Kiel Canal up to the bridge of Holtenau, by the B 503 - a freeway built in 1972 due to the Olympic Games - up to the tunnel junction with the Steenbeker Weg and lastly by the Projensdorfer Straße up to the Westring including the Holstein-Stadion.
History
Originally the quarters of Steenbek and Projensdorf were a part of its neighbouring village Wik. Between the villages of Wik and Suchsdorf there was the estate Gut Projensdorf which attracted the first farmers at the end of 18th century.
In 1867 Steenbek was incorporated into Kiel as a part of the Wik as well as some parts of Projensdorf. In the course of time the areas Wik and Steenbek-Projensdorf were separated through the Kiel Canal and later the B 503. When the districts were restructured in 1994, Steenbek and Projensdorf were merged into Steenbek-Projensdorf, and finally separated from the Wik.

The Vistula Veneti (also called Baltic Veneti) were an Indo-European people that inhabited the region of central Europe east of the Vistula River and the areas around the Bay of Gdańsk. The name first appeared in the 1st century AD in the writings of ancient Romans who differentiated a group of peoples whose manner and language differed from that of the Germanic and Sarmatian tribes. In the 6th century AD, Byzantine sources described the Veneti as the ancestors of the Slavs, who during the second phase of the Migration Period moved south across the northern frontier of the Byzantine Empire.
Roman historical sources
Pliny the Elder places the Veneti along the Baltic coast. He calls them the Sarmatian Venedi (Latin: Sarmatae Venedi). Thereafter, the 2nd century Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy in his section on Sarmatia, places the Greater Ouenedai along the entire Venedic Bay, which can be located from the context on the southern shores of the Baltic. He names tribes south of these Greater Venedae both along the eastern bank of the Vistula and further east.
The most exhaustive Roman treatment of the Veneti comes in Germania by Tacitus, who writing in AD 98, places the Veneti among the peoples on the eastern fringe of Germania. He was uncertain of their ethnic identity, classifying them as Germanic based on their way of life, but not based on their language (in comparison to, for example, the Peucini):
Here Suebia ends. I do not know whether to class the tribes of the Peucini, Venedi, and Fenni with the Germans or with the Sarmatians. The Peucini, however, who are sometimes called Bastarnae, are like Germans in their language, manner of life, and mode of settlement and habitation. Squalor is universal among them and their nobles are indolent. Mixed marriages are giving them something of the repulsive appearance of the Sarmatians ... The Veneti have borrowed largely from Sarmatian ways; their plundering forays take them all over the wooded and mountainous country that rises between the Peucini and the Fenni. Nevertheless, they are to be classed as Germani, for they have settled houses, carry shields and are fond of travelling fast on foot; in all these respects they differ from the Sarmatians, who live in wagons or on horseback.
Byzantine historical sources
Among the Byzantine authors, the Gothic author Jordanes in his work Getica (written in 550 or 551 AD) describes the Veneti as a "populous nation" whose dwellings begin at the sources of the Vistula and occupy "a great expanse of land". He describes them as the ancestors of the Sclaveni (a people who appeared on the Byzantine frontier in the early 6th century and who were the early South Slavs) and of the Antes (East Slavs). Specifically, he states that the Sclaveni and the Antes used to be called the Veneti, but are now "chiefly" (though, by implication, not exclusively) called Sclaveni and Antes. He places the Sclaveni north of a line from the Dniestr to Lake Musianus, the location of which is unclear, but which has been variously identified with Lake Constance, the Tisa–Danube marshes or the Danube delta. He also places the Antes to the east of the Sclaveni.
Later, in Getica he returns to the Veneti stating, that though "off-shoots of one stock [these people] have now three names, that is Veneti, Antes and Sclaveni" and noting that they, at one time, had been conquered by the Goths under Ermanaric. Consistent with the view that the Veneti were an umbrella term for these three peoples, he later also recalls the defeat of the Antes at the hands of a Gothic chieftain named Vinitharius, i.e., conqueror of the Veneti.
Though Jordanes is the only author to explicitly associate the Veneti with what appear to have been Sclaveni and Antes, the Tabula Peutingeriana, originating from the 3rd–4th century AD, separately mentions the Venedi on the northern bank of the Danube somewhat upstream of its mouth, and the Venadi Sarmatae along the Baltic coast.

In the region identified by Ptolemy and Pliny, east of the Vistula and adjoining the Baltic, there was an Iron Age culture known to archaeologists as the West Baltic Cairns Culture or West Baltic Barrow Culture, and the Przeworsk and Zarubintsy cultures east of the Vistula river. The Baltic cultures are associated with the Proto-Balts. These herders lived in small settlements or in little lake dwellings built on artificial islands made of several layers of wooden logs attached by stakes. Their metals were imported, and their dead were cremated and put in urns covered by small mounds. The Przeworsk and Zarubintsy cultures are associated with Proto-Slavs, though the Przeworsk culture was a mix of several tribal societies and is also often linked to the Germanic tribe of Vandals.
Ethnolinguistic character
During the Middle Ages the region east of the mouth of the Vistula river
was inhabited by people speaking Old Prussian, a now-extinct Baltic language in an area described by Tacitus in AD 98 as "Suebian Sea, which washes the country of the Aestii, who have the same customs and fashions as the Suebi". It is unknown what language the yet further east Veneti spoke, although the implication of Tacitus' description of them is that it was not a form of Germanic.
Proto-Slavic and Baltic languages
Linguists agree that Slavic languages evolved in close proximity with the Baltic languages. The two language families probably evolved from a common ancestor, a phylogenetic Proto-Balto/Slavic language continuum. The earliest origins of Slavs seem to lie in the area between the Middle Dnieper and the Bug rivers, where the most archaic Slavic hydronyms have been established. The vocabulary of Proto-Slavic had a heterogenous character and there is evidence that in the early stages of its evolution it adopted some loanwords from centum-type Indo-European languages. It has been proposed that contacts of Proto-Slavs with the Veneti may have been one of the sources for these borrowings. The aforementioned area of proto-Slavic hydronyms roughly corresponds with the Zarubintsy archeological culture which has been interpreted as the most likely locus of the ethnogenesis of Slavs. According to Polish archaeologist Michał Parczewski, Slavs began to settle in southeastern Poland no earlier than the late 5th century AD, the Prague culture being their recognizable expression.
Historic references to the Early Slavs
Modern historians most often link the Veneti to Early Slavs, based on Jordanes' writings from the 6th century:
It is also clear that the Franks in later centuries (see, e.g., Life of Saint Martinus, Fredegar's Chronicle, Gregory of Tours), Lombards (see, e.g., Paul the Deacon), and Anglo-Saxons (see Widsith's Song) referred to Slavs both in the Elbe-Saal region and in Pomerania generally, as Wenden or Winden (see Wends), which was a later corruption of the word Veneti. Likewise, the Franks and Bavarians of Styria and Carinthia referred to their Slavic neighbours as Windische.
It has not been shown that either the original Veneti or the Slavs themselves used the ethnonym Veneti to describe their ethnos. Of course, other peoples, e.g. the Germans (called so first by the Romans), did not have a name for themselves other than localized tribal names.
Controversies
Roland Steinacher states that "The name Veneder was introduced by Jordanes. The assumption that these were Slavs can be traced back to the 19th century to Pavel Josef Šafařík from Prague, who tried to establish a Slavic Origin. Scholars and historians since then viewed the reports on Venedi/Venethi by Tacitus, Pliny and Ptolemy as the earliest historical attestation of Slavs. "Such conceptions, started in the 16th century, resurfaced in the 19th century where they provided the basis for interpretations of the history and origins of Slavs."
Considering Ptolemy's Ouenedai and their location along the Baltic sea, the German linguist, Alexander M. Schenker, asserts that the vocabulary of the Slavic languages shows no evidence that the early Slavs were exposed to the sea. Schenker claims that Proto-Slavic had no maritime terminology and further claims it even lacked a word for amber. Based on this belief, and the fact that Ptolemy refers to the Baltic Sea as the "Venedic" Bay, Schenker decides against a possible identification of the Veneti of Ptolemy's times, with today's Slavs. According to Gołąb, Schenker's conclusion is supported by the fact that to the east of the Venedae, Ptolemy mentions two further tribes called Stavanoi (Σταυανοί) and Souobenoi (Σουοβενοι), both of which have been interpreted as possibly the oldest historical attestations of at least some Slavs.
Others scholars have interpreted these as Prussian tribes (Sudini) as they follow other known Prussian tribes in Ptolemy's listing (e.g., the Galindae (Γαλίνδαι)). Moreover, that conclusion (Gołąb, Schenker), if correct, may only account for the Byzantine Slavs of Jordanes and Procopius since Jordanes clearly (see above) understands Veneti as a group at least as broad as today's Slavs but does not understand the converse to be the case (i.e., his "Slavs" are localized around Byzantium and north through Moravia only) since his Slavs remain a subset of the broader category of Veneti. It also is clear that the Byzantine term "Slav" had gradually replaced the Germanic "Winden"/"Wenden" as applied to all the people we would, today, consider Slavs.
It has been argued that the Veneti were a centum Indo-European people, rather than satem Baltic-speakers. Zbigniew Gołąb considers that the hydronyms of the Vistula and Odra river basins had a North-West Indo-European character with close affinities to the Italo-Celtic branch, but different from the Germanic branch, and show similarities with those attested in the area of the Adriatic Veneti (in Northeastern Italy) as well as those attested in the Western Balkans that are attributed to Illyrians, which points to a possible connection between these ancient Indo-European peoples.
In the 1980s and 1990s some Slovene authors proposed a theory according to which the Veneti were Proto-Slavs and bearers of the Lusatian culture along the Amber Path who settled the region between the Baltic Sea and Adriatic Sea and included the Adriatic Veneti, as presented in their book "Veneti – First Builders of European Community". This theory would place the Veneti as a pre-Celtic, pre-Latin and pre-Germanic population of Europe. The theory is rejected by mainstream historians and linguists.

Rotoroa Island is an island to the east of Waiheke Island in the Hauraki Gulf of New Zealand. It covers . The Salvation Army purchased it for £400 in 1908 from the Ruthe family to expand their alcohol and drug rehabilitation facility at nearby Pakatoa Island. Men were treated at Home Bay at Rotoroa, while women were treated at Pakatoa. This treatment facility was closed in 2005.
In 2008, philanthropists Neal and Annette Plowman negotiated a 99-year lease from the Salvation Army, establishing the Rotoroa Island Trust, and created a programme of restoration and redevelopment, designed to return island access to the people of New Zealand. Rotoroa Island opened to the public for the first time in over 100 years in February 2011.
The Rotoroa Island Museum opened in 2009.
Conservation
The Rotoroa island Trust's vision is for the island to become a sanctuary where people can experience the wonder of New Zealand wildlife.
Auckland Zoo helped Rotoroa's conservation team to identify species suitable for translocation to the island. These include takahē, pāteke (brown teal), tīeke (saddleback) and North Island brown kiwi.
Kiwi
Rotoroa Island is a creche site for Coromandel brown kiwi. Kiwi left in the wild have about a 5% survival rate, the process of taking kiwi chicks to creche sites is known as Operation Nest Egg run by Kiwis for kiwi and brings survival rates to 50-60%. The tiny chicks are released on Rotoroa Island when they are just a few weeks old, weighing 250-300g and are able to grow up in the safety of the island. Every two years, Rotoroa Island does a kiwi muster for adult birds. Weighing about 1kg, the mature kiwi are better able to defend themselves against predators such as stoats and feral cats. Some are returned to the Coromandel, while others are taken to nearby Motutapu Island to establish a new population.
Takahē
Rotoroa is one of ten smaller sanctuary sites working with the Department of Conservation on takahē recovery. The island has operated as a “creche” for takahē chicks since 2015. The Takahē Recovery Programme is managed by the Department of Conservation (DoC) with the aim of protecting and promoting population growth for this endangered species of large, flightless bird – whose current official population is 418 (as of 2020). More than 70 years ago takahē were thought to be extinct.
Other endangered wildlife
More than 9 little pāteke chicks have hatched in the 2020 season. These small dabbling ducks were once found throughout New Zealand but are now considered to be the rarest waterfowl on the mainland with an estimated population of around 2,000-2,500. Tīeke/saddleback population has more than doubled between March 2015 - Oct 2019.
Restoration programme
Removing 22,000 pine trees
Planting over 400,000 native New Zealand trees – over 25 different species (including 30,000 pōhutukawa)
After an extensive pest eradication programme, Rotoroa Island was pronounced predator free in 2014. This is one of the most successful eradications in New Zealand, removing over 300,000 mice through aerial bait drops.
Currently Rotoroa Island has over 50 traps (doC 200) and 50 tracking tunnels as part of biosecurity monitoring.
Restoring 3 holiday homes and a shared hostel accommodation, enabling public to stay overnight.
Developing a museum by architect Rick Pearson which includes an exhibition on the island's history.
Commissioning a significant sculpture by NZ artist, Chris Booth; located at the island's southern point.
Flora
Kauri seedlings were donated to the trust and have since been planted in the forest above Ladies Bay wetlands.
Rotoroa Island is a carbon neutral island — all the trees planted are calculated to remove twice the carbon emitted.

Public Law 110-343 () is a US Act of Congress signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush, which was designed to mitigate the growing financial crisis of the late-2000s by giving relief to so-called "Troubled Assets."
Its formal title is "An Act To provide authority for the Federal Government to purchase and insure certain types of troubled assets for the purposes of providing stability to and preventing disruption in the economy and financial system and protecting taxpayers, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide incentives for energy production and conservation, to extend certain expiring provisions, to provide individual income tax relief, and for other purposes."
The Act created a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (division A), and also enacted the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 (division B), Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 (division C), which also included the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, and the Heartland Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008.
Legislative history
The first version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (structured as an amendment to ) was rejected by the House of Representatives on September 29.
After its defeat, Senate leaders decided to amend an existing bill from the House in order to circumvent the revenue origination clause of U.S. Constitution, and chose H.R. 1424 as the vehicle for the legislation.
H.R. 1424 was sponsored by United States House Representative Patrick J. Kennedy.
On September 30, 2008, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the proposed draft had been formalized for the amendment that would transform H.R. 1424 into the Senate version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.
On October 1, 2008, the amendment to H.R. 1424 was approved by a vote of 74 to 25, and the entire amended bill was passed by 74 to 25, (with one not voting, the cancer-stricken Senator Ted Kennedy). The bill was returned to the House for consideration.
On October 3, 2008, the bill as passed by the Senate was accepted by a vote of 263 to 171 in the House. Every member of the House voted, though the House had a vacant seat of the recently deceased Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law a few hours later.
Three divisions
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 is part of an effort to bail out firms holding mortgage-backed securities in an attempt to restore liquidity to the credit markets.
Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008
The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 contains a new tax credit for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles for less than a year after the first 250,000 are sold. The credit is a base $2,500 plus $417 for each kWh of battery pack capacity in excess of 4 kWh to a maximum of $15,000 for any vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than and up to $7,500 for 12 kWh or more in passenger cars (vehicles up to ).
It also extends existing tax credits for renewable energy initiatives, including cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel development, and wind, solar, geothermal and hydro-electric power. It establishes electricity as a clean-burning fuel for tax purposes.
Separately, this section also requires the reporting of cost basis by brokers to the IRS for certain securities acquired after 2011 – see covered security.
Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008
The Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act includes $100 billion in tax breaks for businesses and the middle class, plus a provision to raise the cap on federal deposit insurance from $100,000 to $250,000.
The Act keeps the alternative minimum tax from hitting 20 million middle-income Americans. It provides $8 billion in tax relief for those hit by natural disasters in the Midwest, Texas and Louisiana.
As a whole, the Senate tax package would cost $150.5 billion over 10 years. Roughly $43.5 billion would be offset by several revenue-raising provisions. Hedge fund managers would be forbidden from using offshore corporations to defer paying taxes.
The bill freezes a tax deduction that oil and gas companies get for certain domestic production activities. The deduction, now 6 percent, is scheduled to rise to 9 percent in 2010.
The provisions of the tax bill included:
A temporary increase in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000 until December 2009
Tax breaks for businesses
Tax credits for the use of alternative energy and plug-in hybrids
Tax credits for research and development
Expansion of the child tax credit
Protection from the Alternative Minimum Tax
Tax reductions for victims of severe weather (e.g. tornadoes, floods, hurricanes)
Extension of unemployment insurance
A USD $1,000 tax credit for low income homeowners
Tax breaks and credit extensions for the following:
"Certain wooden arrows designed for use by children" (Sec 503)
Wool research (Sec. 325)
Film and television productions (Sec. 502)
Litigants in the 1989 Exxon-Valdez oil spill (Sec. 504)

Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008
The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (a part of Division C) mandates that if U.S. health insurance companies provide coverage for mental health and substance abuse, the coverage must be equal for conditions such as psychological disorders, alcoholism, and drug addiction.
This act continues and expands upon the previous Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. It states that financial requirements such as deductibles and copayments and lifetime or dollar limits to mental health benefits and substance abuse disorder benefits should be no more restrictive than those on medical and surgical benefits. MHPAEA applies to employer-sponsored health insurance plans with more than 50 employees, though parity is also extended to small group and individual plans under the Affordable Care Act.
Cost
The Act increased the statutory limit on the public debt by US$700 billion to US$11.3 trillion. However, the legislation is designed to have a net zero long-term cost, and includes language that mandates the President and Congress to develop a plan to recoup any money that is not recouped within 5 years.
Reception
Journalists and critics commented that portions of the bill contained earmarks and pork barrel spending.

Lechters Housewares was a national chain of kitchen-supply stores in the United States, based in Harrison, New Jersey. Many of its stores were in malls. Its store-brand products used the name Cooks Club. It owned the Costless Home Store and Famous Brands Housewares Outlet chains.
In 1975, the firm was started by Albert Lechter as a company that ran housewares departments located in leased space within New Jersey discount stores. Two years later, Lechter teamed up with Donald Jonas to change the business by opening a single stand-alone kitchenware speciality store in a Rockaway, New Jersey, shopping mall. By 1988, the firm had 234 stores. The company went public in 1989. In 1992, the firm grew to 455 stores in 37 states and finally 490 stores in 41 states by the end of 2000. In later years, the company tried to compete with houseware superstores such as Bed Bath & Beyond and Linens 'n Things by expanding rapidly beyond its original kitchenware specialty, a move which created a cash flow problem and contributed to company's downfall.
In 2000, it renamed its stores Lechters Thinkkitchen in advertising, but it was not able to convert its stores to the brand when it declared bankruptcy. It went out of business in 2001.

David Leslie (born 14 April 1952) is a former Scotland international rugby union player. He usually played at number eight, but occasionally at flanker. He played for Scotland 32 times between 1975 and 1985.
Rugby Union career
Amateur career
Leslie went to school at High School of Dundee and Glenalmond College. He went on to play for Dundee HSFP.
Leslie then played for Gala, which he captained.
Provincial career
Leslie played for North and Midlands. He was part of the North and Midlands side that shared the Scottish Inter-District Championship (with Glasgow District) in 1974–75 season.
Leslie started the trial match of 11 January 1975 in the Scotland Possibles side. A strange match; it was split into 3 thirds of 30 minutes each; and the total playing time went to 100 minutes when summing when each third went dead. The Possibles raced into an early commanding lead but personnel movements saw the Scotland Probables side come back into the match. One of those personnel movements was the promotion of Leslie into the Probables side in the second third, with the Glasgow Herald noting that he had an excellent game throughout. Although the Probables eventually took a one-point lead in the match, the Possibles fought back at the end to win.
International career
Leslie was capped by Scotland 'B' twice in the period 1974-75 while still with Dundee HSFP.
Leslie was first capped against Ireland in 1975, but did not become a regular on the Scotland squad until 1981.
Leslie spent much of his playing time injured, missing the 1977, 1978, 1979 Five Nations, and half of the 1980 season. He broke a leg in 1982, missing the 1982 Scotland rugby union tour of Australia.
Leslie scored Scotland's first try against in 1984, only his second for Scotland.
Controversially, Leslie was left off the 1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand. In 1984, he was voted Rugby World'''s "Player of the Season".
Richard Bath writes of him that:
Throughout his career, he was consistently the most focussed and fearless player in a Scottish squad which had more than its fair share of fearless breakaways... for all his intensity, Leslie found it hard to establish himself in the Scottish side until late on in his career.
Allan Massie considered that:
Leslie's first quality is courage. All back-row forwards have to be brave, but Leslie's courage defies reason and probability alike: he reckons any ball on the ground is his to win. The courage is so blinding that one is apt to overlook the skill, judgement and timing with which he launches himself at such balls and attaches himself to them. He is in fact a very skilful educated player (he often played fly-half in his schooldays). He gives and takes a pass better than most of the Scottish three-quarter line. He has acquired the knack of dipping his shoulder into the tackler and slipping the ball at the same moment to a supporting player. He kicks well. Perhaps though his greatest asset with the ball in his hand is his intuitive knowledge of what is right. Jim Telfer has said that he can stop worrying when Leslie has the ball, being 99 per cent sure that he will out it to the best use possible. This is a quality that many of even the best and most spectacular of back-row men never acquire.

The 201st Security Division, originally the 201st Security Brigade, was a German Army rear-area security division of World War II. The unit was deployed in German-occupied areas of the Soviet Union, and was responsible for large-scale war crimes and atrocities including the deaths of thousands of Soviet civilians. It was disbanded in January 1945
Operational history
Formation
The division was formed in June 1942 on the basis of the 201st Security Brigade. The brigade had been deployed on the Eastern Front during Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, and operated in the occupied regions of the Soviet Union behind Army Group Centre's front lines. While a brigade the unit participated in the murder of Jewish civilians alongside Einsatzkommando 9 of Einsatzgruppe B.
Operations
Upon formation, the division operated in the Vitebsk-Polotsk region of the north-western Belarus. Its duties included security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combatting (partisans) in the Wehrmacht's rear areas. The so-called anti-partisan operations in "bandit-infested" areas amounted to the destruction of villages, seizure of livestock, deportation of the able-bodied population for slave labour to Germany, and the murder of those of non-working age.
In September 1942 the division reported killing 864 "partisans in combat" and handed over 245 individuals to the Wehrmacht's Secret Field Police for execution, while suffering 8 dead and 25 wounded itself. Only 99 weapons (rifles, machine-guns and pistols) were seized. In early 1943, the division carried out operations Schneehase, Kugelblitz and Donnerkeil, which resulted in the death of 2,737 "bandits". In the same period, the unit reported 109 German troops killed in action.
The division was sent to front-line duty in February 1943. The unit was largely destroyed during the Soviet Red Army summer offensive Operation Bagration in 1944, with only the staff and supply troops retreating north. In August 1944, it returned to rear-area security operations and spent the rest of its existence in the rear area of the Army Group North. It was disbanded in January 1945.

Dandaragan is a small town in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia.
The name of Dandaragan was first recorded in 1850 as the name of a nearby gulley and spring or watering hole known as Dandaraga spring. The word is Indigenous Australian in origin and is thought to mean good kangaroo country.
The first recorded land lease was to William Brockman in 1848; he had a land lease at Muchamulla Springs.
James Drummond settled in the area in 1850 and established a farm. A police station was built later and the townsite was gazetted in 1958.
The Dandaragan plateau is the underlying geological feature of the area the town is located.
Select Harvests unsuccessfully attempted to grow a large almond orchard near Dandaragan between 2010 and 2015.

Craig Payne (May 22, 1961 – April 7, 2017) was an American boxer best known for his amateur career, particularly for winning the USAABF Championship and certain other amateur accomplishments.
Amateur career
Payne, a 1979 graduate of Chillicothe (Ohio) High School, won the National Golden Gloves in 1983 decisioning a young Mike Tyson.
Payne also defeated Cuban boxing legends Teofilo Stevenson at the 1983 North American Championships in Houston, Texas, and Félix Savón.
Professional career
After his professional debut in 1985, he didn't compete for six years before returning in 1991, well past his prime.
Payne's pro career was quite surprising largely because he was completely out of shape often coming in at 300 lbs.
His least notable success was a KO of previously undefeated Samson Po'uha.

Goshawk Squadron is a 1971 black comedy novel by Derek Robinson which tells of the adventures of a squadron of SE5a pilots from January 1918 to the time of the German spring offensive of March 1918. Goshawk Squadron was Robinson's first novel. The story introduces the character Stanley Woolley, the commander of the squadron — a man who Robinson himself says is not the sort of man you'd want your daughter to marry.
Synopsis
Goshawk Squadron follows a front-line squadron of British pilots late in the war. The commanding officer is Major Stanley Woolley, a cold, cruel and sour taskmaster, training the squadron with brutality. Despite being only 23 years old, the years of war and slaughter have hardened Woolley into a humorless cynic. Woolley especially hates the delusions that replacements have about air combat being gallant and chivalrous. Woolley keeps no emotional attachments, even to his girlfriend Margery, a nurse in the Hospital Corps.
The Germans begin Operation Michael, which leads to a relentless bloodbath. The squadron gets cut to pieces in the endless grind of combat. When Margery's field station gets bombed, she is erroneously reported dead. Realizing how much he did love her, Woolley is shattered and he is incredibly relieved when she appears unharmed. Woolley's unemotional manner is stripped away by this close call. Distracted by the thought of Margery and the life they could have together, Woolley is killed while leading the next combat patrol.
Reception
A review of the book on wordpress.com states that it is now regarded as something of a classic and that 'Robinson searingly conjures up the brutality and insanity of the war'. The book was recognised at the time of its publication for its quality and was nominated for the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1971.

Between 2011 and 2014, the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), part of the Department of Justice, engaged in a campaign of sting operations in which individuals were enticed to participate in gun and drug related crimes against fictitious stash house targets for which they were then arrested and convicted. The made up crimes were in fact entirely the creation of ATF, and as described by two federal judges, carried severe sentences (typically 15 years) but were likely to cause grave unfairness and miscarriage of justice.
A USA Today investigation in 2013 showed that over 1000 individuals have been incarcerated for lengthy periods since 2011 for such fake crimes, and that the strategy has become a key part of the Bureau's strategy. ATF officials stated that the strategy pre-emptively targeted people likely to commit serious crime rather than waiting for them to do so; opponents and critics, and later, judges, expressed concerns that it was tantamount to entrapment and punishing people for thoughts and possibilities rather than actual criminal acts, by presenting them with deliberately hard to resist fabricated inducements and goading them to become a participant, or to engage in more extreme criminal activities, up to an extent chosen almost completely by ATF.
In a 2013 federal case (Brown et al.), district court judge Rubén Castillo determined that lawyers had made a strong showing of potential bias relating to the operation of robbery stings conducted by the ATF, and ordered prosecutors to identify everyone that the government had charged in similar cases in the Northern District of Illinois. In 2014 California judge Otis Wright went further and dismissed another such case (Hudson) as "outrageous" government conduct and "unconstitutional", stating that it had neither prevented nor detected crime, but cost the taxpayer dearly, and that the overwhelming extent of ATF direction of the purported crime, and the level of ATF involvement, made the ATF operative more of a participant rather than an observer, the sentence a reflection of ATF whim rather than defendant's own conduct, and the case into one that lacked due process.
Accusation of racial bias
In legal proceedings filed in Chicago, a team of attorneys sought dismissal of charges against 40 defendants. One study that was unsealed had concluded that the ATF showed racial bias in target selection for the sting operations. The study concluded that the disparity between white and black defendants was so large that the chances of it being explained by any reason other than racial bias was around zero.
U.S. v. Hudson, Whitfield & Dunlap (decided 2014)
The case was one of many US Government cases where a situation was presented to members of the public, who were tempted into committing a crime related to drugs, theft, or firearms, on the basis of a fabricated situation "sting operation". In this case, the judge Otis D. Wright II dismissed citing outrageous government conduct. He found that by fabricating every aspect of the supposed circumstances in a manner calculated to entice the subjects' involvement, the government acted "repugnant[ly] to the Constitution" by creating a crime "cut from whole cloth" that was intended not to fail to entice involvement, and was not related to any actual or existent criminal enterprise, but was calculated to produce a sentence of around 15 years.
US entrapment case law
In Jacobson v. United States () the Supreme Court considered an entrapment case from outside drug enforcement, and overturned the conviction of a Nebraska man for ordering child pornography after two years of being cajoled by material created by postal inspectors. The Court held that the government must show that predisposition existed before the government became involved, and prior behavior when an activity was legal does not constitute evidence of predisposition to break the law if the conduct is subsequently made illegal. (Contrast Hampton v. United States, where predisposition did exist, even though the drugs and drug-related activity of the defendant in that case wholly coincided with the encouragement of law enforcement agents.)

WKLH (96.5 FM) is a classic rock-formatted radio station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The station is owned by Saga Communications. Its studios (which are shared with the other four sister stations) are located on Milwaukee's West Side and the transmitter is the MPTV tower in Shorewood.
WKLH broadcasts in the digital hybrid HD Radio format.
History
The station received its Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license on November 30, 1955. They signed on the air as WFMR on June 26, 1956 with a classical music format from the Bayshore Shopping Center in Glendale, with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 24.5 kilowatts and an antenna height of 35 feet above average terrain (HAAT). They began broadcasting in stereo in 1962. In June 1969, it boosted its power to 40 kW, becoming the most powerful FM station in Milwaukee at that time. They got another power upgrade in July 1974, this time to 50 kW.
WMGF
In January 1983, the station's owners switched the format to adult contemporary, picking up the call sign WMGF and named the station Magic 96.5. Three months later, on April 27, 1983, the owner of (WXJY) picked up the WFMR call sign, its classical music format, and several of its air talents.
WKLH
WMGF carried on for three years until flipping formats to classic hits as WKLH on January 27, 1986. WKLH was an immediate success, almost tripling its ratings and landing in the top five stations in the market in its first ratings book. It tweaked to classic rock in early 2005 as the classic hits format itself in the industry drifted towards a more pop-leaning sound with 80s and early 90s music. WKLH has long been a ratings success in the Milwaukee area, and has also won many awards, including Radio & Records "Classic Rock Station of the Year" in 2001. On April 23, 2015, WKLH rebranded as "Hometown Rock 96.5."
Ironically, WKLH's sister stations are the two other frequencies associated with WFMR: 98.3 and 106.9.
The WKLH call letters previously belonged to AM 1580 and FM 92.1 (K-92) in Saint Johns, Michigan, from October 1983 to September 1985. But before that, the WKLH call letters belonged to a Montgomery, Alabama radio station operating at 92.3 MHz from 1973 through 1977 and was known as "Stereo 92."
Dave and Carole
The Dave and Carole morning show dominated the Milwaukee radio ratings since WKLH debuted in 1986. Based on a yearly 4 rating book average, this show has finished either #1 or #2 in Adults 25-54 for 22 consecutive years.
The show was hosted by Dave Luczak and Carole Caine, who did the news and added the "female" perspective. The other regular was Kevin (KB) Brandt. KB is a former stand-up comedian and a musician who also performs in several local bands. Since early 2002, the show has been produced by Marcus Allen.
Over the past 20+ years, the show has featured a rotating cast. Regulars have included many current or former athletes and coaches. These include former Milwaukee Brewer Paul Molitor (86-92), former Brewer manager Phil Garner (92-98), then-Green Bay Packer coach Mike Holmgren (92-98), QB Brett Favre (97-00), defensive lineman Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila (02-06), and former Brewer pitching coach Mike Maddux (05-08). Other sports guests include LeRoy Butler, a member of the Packer Hall of Fame and Jason Wilde of the Wisconsin State Journal, twice Wisconsin sports writer of the year and famed glee club aficionado.
Other current or former regular cast members include:;
Mike Gousha from WISN 12 in Milwaukee, improv master Dylan Bolin "Out Of The Box", Segway King Angelo "Mort" Snotlocker, Rudy "Itchy" Itchkowski, Gino (The Judge) Salomone, "MR. Angry",
Dutch "Wandering Wisconsin", Joyce Garbaciak from WISN-12, Katrina Cravy from FOX 6, Greg "The Gristleman" Koch, John McGivern, Willy Porter, Genesis touring guitarist Daryl Stuermer and more.
Dave and Carole have also hosted hundreds of thousands of comedians in their studios. Since 1988 they have featured the weekly headliner at the Comedy Cafe in Milwaukee. Other comedy "regulars" include: Fred Klett, Jim Gaffigan, Kyle Cease, Kathleen Madigan and Stephen Lynch and Wisconsin native Frank Caliendo.
Dave and Carole also produce and host many live shows in the Milwaukee area. These include their yearly "Comedy 4 Kids" at the Riverside Theater, "Dave and Carole-ing" for Christmas, their annual Christmas show also at the Riverside Theater, and the "Music of the Morning 'KLH" featuring the talented musicians of the morning show. All of these shows are fund raisers for their various charity endeavors and all shows typically sell out within seconds.
On June 29, 2015, Carole Caine was let go by Saga after her contract was not renewed, ending a 29-year career at WKLH. Mornings are currently hosted by Dave Luczak.
Miracle Marathon
Once every year starting in 1998, WKLH's morning show, Dave & Carole, host the "Miracle Marathon" to raise money for Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Over the course of three days in 2008, they raised over $1.4 million. Dave and Carole's 11-year total is over $11 million.

Hungary has recognized registered partnerships since 1 July 2009, offering same-sex couples nearly all the rights and benefits of marriage. Unregistered cohabitation for same-sex couples was recognised and placed on equal footing with the unregistered cohabitation of different-sex couples in 1996. However, same-sex marriage is prohibited by the 2011 Constitution of Hungary, which took effect in January 2012.
Unregistered cohabitation
Cohabitation law applies to couples living together in an economic and sexual relationship, including opposite-sex and same-sex couples. No official registration is required. Hungarian law gives some specified rights and benefits to two persons living together. These rights include hospital visitation and access to medical information, jail and prison visitation rights for the partner of an incarcerated person, right to make decisions about the deceased partner's funeral, right to declare a same-sex partner as a next of kin, widow's pension, immigration rights, etc. Some of these benefits require an official statement from the social department of the local government that proves that the partners are indeed cohabiting.
Registered partnerships
In 2007, the Gyurcsány Government, comprising the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) and the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), submitted a bill to the National Assembly to establish registered partnerships for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Parliament adopted the bill on 17 December 2007. This act would have provided all of the rights of marriage to registered partners except for the ability to adopt and to take a common surname. The registered partnership act would have entered into force on 1 January 2009, but on 15 December 2008 the Hungarian Constitutional Court declared it unconstitutional on the grounds that it duplicated the institution of marriage for opposite-sex couples. The court found that a registered partnership law that only applied to same-sex couples would be constitutional; indeed, it opined that the Parliament had a duty to introduce such a law. Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány instructed the Minister of Justice, Tibor Draskovics, to draft a new, revised bill that would conform to the court's decision.
On 23 December 2008, the government announced that it would introduce a new registered partnership bill in line with the Constitutional Court's decision. The legislation would offer same-sex couples all of the rights offered by the previous act, and would be presented to Parliament as early as February 2009. On 12 February 2009, the government approved the new bill, and it was adopted by the National Assembly on 20 April 2009. 199 MPs (from the governing Socialist and Alliance of Free Democrats parties) voted for the bill, while 159 MPs (mostly from Fidesz and the Christian Democratic People's Party) voted against it, and 8 unallied MPs abstained. The new registered partnership act took effect on 1 July 2009. On 23 March 2010, the Constitutional Court ruled that the law is constitutional.
Registered partnerships (, ) are only open to same-sex couples. Registered partners are entitled to the same inheritance and property rights, widow's pension, tax benefits, social benefits, and immigration and naturalization rights as married spouses. Partners are also entitled to receive information about the health of their partner and make medical decisions if the partner cannot do so themselves (e.g. accident), are treated as next-of-kin in criminal law, and are protected from domestic violence. Unlike married spouses, registered partners cannot take a common surname, adopt or participate in artificial insemination.
In February 2018, the Budapest District Court ruled that Hungary must recognize same-sex marriages performed abroad as registered partnerships.
Statistics
The number of registered partnerships established in Hungary per year is shown in the table below.
Same-sex marriage
In September 2007, the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, part of the governing coalition since the 2002 elections, presented a draft same-sex marriage bill to the Parliament's Human Rights Committee. This would have defined marriage as the union of "two persons" over the age of 18 irrespective of gender. On 6 November 2007, the committee rejected the bill without debate. Opponents of the bill pointed to a Constitutional Court ruling a few months earlier that defined the institution of marriage as a bond "between a man and a woman".
On 1 January 2012, a new constitution enacted by the government of Viktor Orbán, leader of the ruling Fidesz party, came into effect, restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples and containing no guarantees of protection from discrimination on account of sexual orientation. Article L reads: "Hungary shall protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman established by voluntary decision, and the family as the basis of the nation's survival."
On 29 June 2015, Deputy Gábor Fodor from the Liberal Party introduced a constitutional amendment to define marriage as a union of two people and a bill to make appropriate changes in statutory laws. Both measures were rejected by the Parliament's Justice Committee on 26 October 2015.
Public opinion
Several opinion polls have been conducted to gauge the attitudes of Hungarians on the issue of same-sex marriage and registered partnerships. A Eurobarometer survey released in December 2006 found that 18% of Hungarians believed same-sex marriages should be allowed throughout Europe. A poll conducted by Medián in July 2007 showed that 30% of respondents considered it "acceptable" for same-sex couples to get married, and a poll by MASMI (Market Research & Public Opinion Polling) published in December 2007 showed that 35% of Hungarians were in favour of allowing same-sex couples to marry.
A poll by Szonda Ipsos in September 2009 found that the majority of Hungarians, 58%, supported the newly introduced registered partnership law for same-sex couples.
A May 2013 Ipsos poll found that 30% of respondents were in favour of same-sex marriage and another 21% supported other forms of recognition for same-sex couples.
The 2015 Eurobarometer found that 39% of Hungarians thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 53% were opposed.
A 2016 opinion poll conducted by Budapest Pride and Integrity Lab found that 36% of Hungarians were in favour of same-sex marriage, while 56% were opposed and 7% were undecided (21% "strongly" supported, 15% "somewhat" supported, 15% "somewhat" opposed and 41% "strongly" opposed). The poll also found that 60% of the population agreed that lesbian, gay and bisexual people should have the same rights as heterosexual people, and 46% supported adoption rights for same-sex couples with 47% opposed. Support for same-sex marriage was higher among women (40%) than among men (33%), higher among university graduates (43%), and higher among people who personally knew a gay person (46%). Opposition was mainly concentrated among religious people, with 75% of regular church attendees opposing same-sex marriage, decreasing based on the level of church attendance, and among voters of the ruling Fidesz party (71%). Among irreligious people, support and opposition both stood at 47%. Despite a majority of Hungarians opposing same-sex marriage, the poll found that 60% disagreed with the belief that same-sex marriage poses a threat to Hungarian values and 66% were of the opinion that "same-sex couples want to get married as a show of their mutual love and devotion".
A poll by Pew Research Center published in May 2017 found that 27% of Hungarians were in favor of same-sex marriage, while 64% opposed it. Support was higher among non-religious people (34%) and 18–34 year olds (39%), in contrast to Catholics (25%) and people aged 35 and over (23%).
The 2019 Eurobarometer found that 33% of Hungarians thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 61% were opposed.
A May 2021 Ipsos poll showed that 46% of Hungarians supported same-sex marriage, 20% supported partnerships but not marriage, while 18% were opposed to all legal recognition for same-sex couples, and 17% were undecided.

The crash ball is an attacking tactic in rugby league and rugby union where a player receives a pass at pace and runs to the opposition's defensive line. The crash ball runner attempts to commit two or more opposing players to the tackle, then attempts to make the ball available to teammates by offloading in the tackle, performing a quick play-the-ball in rugby league, or recycling the ball quickly from the ruck in rugby union. By committing players to the tackle, the crash ball runner creates holes in the opposition's defense, thereby creating attacking opportunities for teammates.
The crash ball is a common tactic in rugby league, especially amongst props and second rowers. In rugby union, crash ball running is often performed by midfielders as a way to create space for the outside backs.
The crash ball may also be used when an attacking side is a couple of meters away from the opposition try-line. A player, usually a lock or other forward, will run onto a pass and attempt to run into a defender with enough force to be able to push them back over their line and then be able to ground the ball and score a try.
Size, strength and resilience are the main assets of an effective crash ball runner; passing and handling skills are also important.

East Lawn Cemetery and Sherman Burbank Memorial Chapel is a historic cemetery and chapel at 605 Main Street in Williamstown, Massachusetts. Established in 1842, it is the newest and largest cemetery in Williamstown; the two older cemeteries date to the 18th century. It was established at a time when West Lawn Cemetery (established 1766) was in need of expansion, and this site was chosen for the location of a new cemetery. The initial few acres of land were donated by Asahel Foote, who sat on the committee formed to investigate the town's cemetery needs. The cemetery grew in size over the next several decades, reaching a size of about by the early 20th century. Approximately half of the cemetery (representing its developed portion) and its associated chapel were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.
The Sherman Burbank Memorial Chapel was designed in 1935 by Frank Rushmore Watson in the Late Gothic Revival style, and dedicated in 1937. An associated cottage, probably intended for a caretaker, was also planned but never built. The funding for the chapel came from Sherman H. Banks of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, whose mother was from the Sherman family that was one of Williamstown's oldest. The chapel is located near the cemetery entrance, not far from Main Road. In addition to the main chapel chamber, it has a space off to one side for use as a receiving vault, and a porte cochere with a small hall and other facilities on the west side.

Oleg Mutu (born 22 July 1972) is a Romanian cinematographer and film producer. He was born in Chișinău, then part of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic.
With director Cristian Mungiu, Mutu developed a formula of lengthy takes and medium shots with the director's first feature film, Occident (2002). Mutu later produced and directed photography for Mungiu's 2007 Palme d'Or-winning film 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days. Mutu opted for a minimalist approach, lighting the backgrounds while attempting not to distract from the characters too much. Mutu also set up lights from building roofs for the final scenes, employing a rod and paper lanterns for the camera. For the film, he shared the European Film Award for Best Film, the first time a Romanian work won the honour. At Romania's national Gopo Awards, he shared the award for Best Feature Film and won Best Cinematography.

Streamline is a British Golden Age superhero comic, which appeared in the short-lived magazine Streamline Comics (1947), which only ran for four issues. The character was co-created by Denis Gifford and Bob Monkhouse, and later appeared as a character in the 2000 AD strip Zenith and the independent title Black Tower Comics Group Adventures.
Publication history
Streamline was co-created by Denis Gifford and Bob Monkhouse, first appearing in Streamline Comics #1 (1947) published by Cardal Publishing.

is a Japanese light novel series, written by Yuu Kamiya and Tsubaki Himana, and illustrated by Shino. Kodansha has published four volumes since April 2, 2013 under their Kodansha Ranobe Bunko imprint. The story is set in a clockpunk fantasy version of the world, in which the entire planet is run by clockwork. The main characters are five people (a machine otaku, two automata, a young technician and a bodyguard) who, after a month of meeting, become the world's most infamous terrorists.
A manga adaptation illustrated by Kuro was serialized in Kodansha's shōnen manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Sirius since 2013 and ended in August 2018. It has been collected in ten tankōbon volumes. An anime television series adaptation by Xebec aired from April 6 to June 22, 2017.
Plot
At an unspecified point in time, Earth collapses. Despite it being almost inevitable that humankind would die out, a genius engineer known only as "Y" manages to rebuild Earth entirely with gears and clockwork mechanisms, renaming it "Clockwork Planet". 1,000 years later, original cities of Earth's countries are flourishing inside the planet's surface gears. Naoto Miura, a high school student living in Grid: Kyoto who is in love with mechanics, is dragged into a world crisis when a mechanical crate crashes into his apartment. There, he meets RyuZU, a broken automaton who is part of the Initial-Y Series, a series of automaton created personally by Y himself. Using his superior sense of hearing, Naoto fixes her in three hours despite RyuZU having been broken for 206 years as nobody was able to revive her. Promising loyalty to him, the two are eventually found out by Dr. Marie Bell Breguet, a princess of a noble family and the youngest person to become a master engineer in an international separate government organization "Meister Guild", and her automaton bodyguard Vainney Halter. With the faulty Core Tower, a central tower in every Grid city that controls its gear functions, Naoto pinpoints the problem with his sense of hearing alone in ten minutes, fixing it along with other engineers of the Meister Guild and thwarting the government's attempts to purge the city and destroy lives. As the government's illegal technological experimentation is still at large, the pairs join forces to carry out justice and prevent further purges.
A month after their encounter, all four appear in Akihabara, Tokyo, having become the world's most infamous terrorists in their quest.

The 2013 season was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 38th in the National Football League, and second under head coach Greg Schiano. It also marked the 19th and final season under the ownership of Malcolm Glazer, who died on May 28, 2014. The Buccaneers finished with a record of 4–12 and failed to improve their 7–9 record from last season, and were eliminated from postseason contention in Week 13. For the first time since 1996, longtime cornerback Ronde Barber was not on the roster, as he retired in May 2013.
Despite having a +10 turnover margin (tied for 3rd best in the NFL), and franchise rookie quarterback records from third round draft pick Mike Glennon, the overall offensive production ranked near the bottom of the league in most categories. The team ranked 32nd (last) in total yards, 32nd (last) in passing yards, 30th in total points scored. The team also had the third-most penalties in the league (121 for 1,136 yards), and ranked 31st in third down conversions. Running back Doug Martin went on injured reserve halfway through the season with a shoulder injury. His replacement, Bobby Rainey had a solid performance, scoring his first career touchdown, and setting a franchise record for longest touchdown run (80 yards). On the defensive side, the offseason news was highlighted by the free agent acquisition of Darrelle Revis, and Lavonte David's stellar numbers.
Season
The team got off to a dismal start, which created considerable tension inside and outside the locker room, as well as among fans. The fan support of head coach Greg Schiano began to decay, as illustrated by a local radio station erecting a billboard carrying the message "Fire Schiano." The trouble started on opening day, as Tampa Bay had a last-second loss to the Jets, owing primarily to a personal foul late hit penalty, which advanced the Jets into field goal range, and an improbable comeback victory. Late-game losses to New Orleans, Arizona, and Seattle brought the Buccaneers to an 0–8 start. The Buccaneers won four of their next five games, but were ultimately eliminated from playoff contention by December, and they dropped the last three games.
One day after the conclusion of the regular season, head coach Greg Schiano and general manager Mark Dominik were fired.
For the first time since 2009, all eight regular season home games were announced as a "sellout," and no regular season games were blacked out locally. Due to the new concussion rule, the Bucs did not wear their "creamsicle" throwback uniforms at all during this season.
Darrelle Revis was named the Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year.
Josh Freeman benching
The season started out on a rocky note, as reports of a rift between head coach Greg Schiano and starting quarterback Josh Freeman were coming from the locker room. Freeman was entering the final season of his contract, and trade rumors were already being tossed around by media and fans. An allegation surfaced that Schiano rigged the voting for team captains, which prevented Freeman from being selected by his teammates. The next day, Freeman missed the annual team photo session, an absence he blamed on "oversleeping." After starting the season 0–3, Freeman was quickly criticized for his poor offensive output, throwing a league-worst 45.3% completion percentage, two interceptions, and only two touchdown passes. It was also leaked that Freeman was a stage one participant in the NFL drug program, a situation related to his treatment of ADHD. On week four, Freeman was benched in favor of rookie Mike Glennon, and on October 3, 2013, Freeman was released from the team as he granted.
MRSA outbreak
During training camp, an outbreak of MRSA was reported in the Tampa Bay locker room. Carl Nicks and Lawrence Tynes contracted the infection over the summer. Nicks missed several games, while Tynes was placed on the non-football injured reserve list. After a third player, Johnthan Banks, was diagnosed in early October, the week 6 games against the Eagles was in jeopardy of postponement, due to concerns over transmission. However, it was held as scheduled after medical specialists and NFLPA representatives inspected the facility.
2013 Draft class
Trades
The Buccaneers acquired an additional 2013 seventh-round pick (226th overall) that sent defensive tackle Brian Price to the Chicago Bears on July 26, 2012.
The Buccaneers later traded that same additional 2013 seventh-round pick (226th overall) that was acquired by the Bears, along with cornerback Aqib Talib, to the New England Patriots in exchange for a 2013 fourth-round pick (126th overall) on November 1, 2012.
Tampa Bay traded Arrelious Benn and a seventh-round pick to Philadelphia in exchange for the Eagles' 2013 sixth-round pick (196th overall) and a conditional draft pick in 2014.
Tampa Bay traded their first-round pick (13th overall) and a conditional fourth-round pick in 2014, to the Jets in exchange for Darrelle Revis.
Tampa Bay traded their fourth-round selection (112th overall) and their sixth-round selection (181st overall) to Oakland in exchange for the Raiders' fourth-round selection (100th overall) in order to draft Akeem Spence on the third day of the 2013 NFL Draft.
Tampa Bay traded LeGarrette Blount to New England for Jeff Demps and a seventh-round selection (229th overall).
Tampa Bay traded their sixth-round selection (196th overall) and their seven-round selection (229th overall) to Minnesota for a sixth-round selection (189th overall) in order to draft Mike James on the third day of the 2013 NFL Draft.
Tampa Bay traded their 2014 sixth-round selection to Chicago for Gabe Carimi.

With 3:23 left in the game, Glennon, deep in his own territory, threw a costly interception, which set up an Arizona touchdown, and a brief 10–10 tie. With 1:33 left in regulation, Arizona kicked the game-winning field goal to win 13–10.

Winless Tampa Bay shocked 7-1 Seattle by jumping out to a 21–0 lead just before halftime. However, the Seahawks came back in the second half to tie the game and force overtime. Tampa Bay won the coin toss in overtime, but went 3-and-out on their first possession. Seattle kicked a field goal on the next possession, completing their greatest comeback (21 points) in franchise history.
This loss dropped the Buccaneers to 0–8 on the season, a feat shared with the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Week 10: vs. Miami Dolphins
The Buccaneers defense allowed a franchise low 2 rushing yards for the entire game, besting the previous record set last season during the home opener, when the Buccaneers' rushing defense held Carolina to 10 rushing yards.

Stafford was leading the Lions on a potential game-winning or game-tying drive in the final minute. At the Tampa Bay 28-yard line with 1:00 left, Stafford threw to Calvin Johnson at the 3-yard line. Johnson appeared to catch the ball, but it was stripped out and fell into the hands of Johnthan Banks for an interception, and sealed the win for Tampa Bay.

On offense, Mike Glennon threw two touchdown passes, one each to Vincent Jackson and Tim Wright. The Buccaneers defense had seven sacks and four interceptions, out of which Lavonte David made one sack and two interceptions. On special teams, Dashon Goldson recovered a fumble muffed by the punt returner.
Week 15: vs. San Francisco 49ers
Vincent Jackson and Tim Wright caught the only two touchdowns for the Buccaneers in the game, which were not enough to stop the 49ers from trouncing the team 33–14. On defense, Gerald McCoy and Adrian Clayborn had the only sacks for the Bucs. Late in the game, Eric Page attempted to hand the ball to Russell Shepard on a tricky play during a kick return; however, Shepard fumbled the ball, allowing the 49ers' Kendall Hunter to recover and return it for a touchdown.
With the loss, the Buccaneers' record dropped to 4–10.
Week 16: at St. Louis Rams

The Church on the Hill is located just outside that village on Main Street (NY 301) in Nelsonville, New York, United States. It is the oldest church in the town of Philipstown, which includes both villages, and has been in use continually since its 1831 construction. Its white steeple, at the rise on the line between the villages, is a Nelsonville landmark. The parsonage located on Parsonage Street in Cold Spring is also owned by the church and on the National Historic Registry.
It is also the only frame church of any note within the Hudson Highlands. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and is situated next to Gothic Italianate home at 6 Parsonage Street.
Building
The church is a frame clapboard structure on a stone foundation. The projecting entrance bay frames the doorway with corner pilasters and a plain entablature. The doorway itself is also pilastered, with bracketed capitals and a modillioned cornice.
From these rises a tall pendented steeple, atop an octagonal cupola whose arched openings are filled with louvered panels. The roof is gabled with returns; the projecting eaves are likewise bracketed. All sides have rounded stained-glass windows and corner pilasters.
A later addition, on the rear, has a lower but similar roof and dentilled cornice. Two other additions are of similarly sympathetic styling.
History
The congregation was formed in 1799; it met in members' homes until 1831, when it had grown big enough to afford a church of its own. Samuel and Mary Gouverneur, owners of a large estate that became much of present-day Nelsonville, donated the land in 1831. A man named Davenport (first name unknown) designed the church; William Bowne built it for $825 ($ in 2008 dollars).
It has been added on to several times since and partially rebuilt once. In 1854 the steeple and rear lecture hall were added. A baptistry was carved out of the interior 20 years later. Finally, a 1962 addition to the rear added classrooms, a kitchen and dining room. The interior was damaged by a fire in 1978; it was restored and reopened two years later.
In recent years, the church has left the American Baptists and reorganized as "A non-denominational Christian Community," with the official mantle of "Church on the Hill" in place of "The Cold Spring Baptist Church." The church's pastors are Rev. Tim and Rev. Beth Greco. Pastor Beth Greco is also the CEO of the Hoving Home in Garrison NY, Oxford NJ, Pasadena CA and Las Vegas NV. Pastor Tim also serves as media leassion for the home.
The Church is a Bible believing, Jesus loving, sin hating, devil chasing, Holy Spirit filled, water baptizing, congregation.

Aloha, Bobby and Rose is a 1975 American road drama film written and directed by Floyd Mutrux and starring Paul Le Mat, Dianne Hull and Robert Carradine. The plot concerns a young working-class couple who accidentally cause the death of a store clerk during their first date and go on the run from the law.
Plot
In the 1970s Hollywood, Bobby works as an auto mechanic by day and shoots pool and races his red 1968 Chevrolet Camaro by night. His friend Moxey is excited to be accepted to transmission school and build his skills for a better-paying job. The less responsible Bobby seems to have no such direction in life and is still relying on his uncle Charlie, a used-car salesman, to help him out of jams, such as by lending him money to pay off his poolhall bets to some menacing Chicanos.
Rose is the young single mother of a five-year-old son. Rose and her son live with her mother, who minds the boy while Rose works at a car wash. Bobby meets Rose when he returns her Volkswagen Beetle Cabriolet after it had been serviced at his garage. Bobby tries to charm Rose into driving him back to the garage, but she refuses and tells him to take the bus. Later, she sees him unsuccessfully trying to hitchhike in the rain and picks him up. When Rose stops at her house to change, Bobby discovers that she has a young son, but he is not bothered by it and spends time talking to the boy.
Bobby and Rose go on a date, including ice skating, window shopping, a stop at Pink's Hot Dogs, parking under the Hollywood Sign and cruising the Sunset Strip. They daydream about moving to Hawaii. During a stop at a convenience store for wine, Bobby pulls a prank on the teenage store clerk by pretending he is a robber with a fake gun. But the joke backfires when the shop owner emerges from the back room with a shotgun pointed at Bobby. To save Bobby, Rose hits the owner over the head with a bottle, and as he falls, the gun fires, accidentally killing the young clerk.
Bobby and Rose flee, first in Rose's VW, which they crash, and then in Bobby's red Camaro, heading for Mexico. Rose misses her son and at one point boards a bus to return home, but she cannot leave Bobby and exits the bus. In San Diego, the pair meet flamboyant Texans Buford and Donna Sue, who invite Bobby and Rose to go to Mexico with them. The two couples travel to Tijuana where Buford and Bobby bond in the party atmosphere, but Rose still misses her son, so Bobby and Rose leave Mexico and return to Los Angeles to retrieve him.
After painting Bobby's car black and picking up Rose's son, Bobby and Rose stop at an ice-cream parlor on the way out of town, where Rose leaves her son alone in the car for a few minutes while going inside. A police officer sees the boy alone in the car. Upon seeing police surrounding their car, Bobby and Rose abandon the car, leaving her son to be taken by the police, and hurry to a nearby cheap motel to hide out. Bobby calls his uncle Charlie to bring him a getaway car, but Rose separately contacts the police, who have her son, and tells them that she wants to talk about the recent "accident," offering the name of the motel where she and Bobby are staying. The police arrive that night in a rainstorm just as Charlie drives up with the getaway car. As Bobby runs toward the car, the police mistakenly think that he has a gun and, despite Rose's screams, shoot Bobby down. Rose cries over Bobby's body.

Release and reception
The film was distributed by Columbia Pictures. Although production began on October 22, 1973, the release date was April 23, 1975.
Box office
The film was produced on a low budget of $600,000, but it topped the American box office during its opening weekend (April 25–26), earning $5.3 million on 557,000 admissions from 365 screens. As of May 20, 1975, it had grossed ($35 million). The film was the seventh-highest-grossing American film of 1975.According to Variety, the film earned $6 million in theatrical rentals at the North American box office.
Critical response
Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote a negative review, stating: "The only tragic thing in a film like this is the quality of stupidity the characters are forced to exhibit in order to keep the plot going." Joseph McBride of Variety wrote: "Youth-on-the-lam theme, the staple of so many pix in the last 10 years, is getting tired, and the fatigue shows clearly in 'Aloha, Bobby and Rose.'" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded the film two stars out of four and dismissed it as "one of those overwrought sob stories about a young couple who are always getting in trouble. The guy's got a slightly brutish outlook on the world; the girl knows how to twist her hair and cry a lot." Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film "plays like a rehash of several dozen movies that you've sat through before, restlessly. You wince to see the waste of two attractive performers and a fair amount of competent craftsmanship on material so lacking in originality, aptness of thought or simple interest." Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it "an inarticulate film about inarticulate characters." In a retrospective review, Richard Brody of the New Yorker described it as a "tough, uncompromising, and inventive independent film that cleaned up at the box office."
A review in Time Out compared the film with the critically acclaimed 1973 film American Graffiti, which also starred Le Mat, but the review goes on to say: "[W]ith little characterisation or depth, the plot doesn't finally add up to much more than a coda to Graffiti."

Puerto Rico celebrates all official U.S holidays, and a number of other official holidays established by the Commonwealth government.
Additionally, many municipalities celebrate their own Patron Saint Festivals (fiestas patronales in Spanish), as well as festivals honoring cultural icons like Bomba y plena, danza, salsa, hamacas (hammocks), and popular crops such as plantains and coffee.
Until June 30, 2014, there were 19 public holidays in Puerto Rico. As a result of a new Commonwealth law, after July 1, 2014, the Commonwealth government consolidated three of its former holidays (Luis Muñoz Rivera, José Celso Barbosa, and Luis Muñoz Marín) into just one called Día de los Próceres Puertorriqueños (The Day of Illustrious Puerto Ricans), and reducing the number of holidays observed publicly to 17. As part of the new law, the third Monday of February became Día de los Próceres Puertorriqueños when, in addition to commemorating the birth of those three illustrious Puerto Ricans will also include commemorating the birthdays of four other illustrious Puerto Ricans – Ramón Emeterio Betances, Román Baldorioty de Castro, Ernesto Ramos Antonini and Luis A. Ferré. The law mandated that the Eugenio Maria de Hostos holiday and the Jose de Diego holiday would continue to be observed on their respective days as usual.
Official public holidays
Official public holidays are those recognized by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government. All public offices must close. Many businesses also elect to close. These public holidays include both federal and commonwealth-established holidays, since Puerto Rico recognizes all U.S. federal holidays.

The African Orthodox Church (AOC), registered as the Holy African Orthodox Church, is an Episcopalian, primarily African-American denomination which was founded in the United States in 1918 by the joint collaboration of its first Patriarch George Alexander McGuire and Marcus M. Garvey. It has approximately 15 parishes and 5,000 members, significantly down from its peak membership.
The AOC holds to the historic three-fold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons, and lays strong emphasis on apostolic succession. The church celebrates the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church. Its worship is liturgical, of Eastern and Western rites. The Nicene, Apostles', and Athanasian creeds are affirmed.
History
The African Orthodox Church (AOC) was founded on the belief that black Episcopalians should have a denomination of their own. Episcopal rector George Alexander McGuire was consecrated a bishop on September 28, 1921, who had served as Chaplain-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (U. N. I. A.), in Chicago, Illinois, by an episcopus vagans, Archbishop Joseph Rene Vilatte, assisted by Bishop Carl A. Nybladh who had been consecrated by Vilatte. This placed Bishop McGuire in apostolic succession, which was something he had greatly desired.
The United States Census Bureau's Religious Bodies, 1926 edition, first reported one denomination "which now has a thriving organization of congregations" derived from Vilatte, that "aspires to ultimate association with Eastern Orthodox Churches as a racial or national unit" and "does not desire any association with Old Catholic Churches"—the . It had its episcopal see in New York City but incorporated in Florida. It claimed 13 organizations, with a membership of 1,508 without a church edifice. There was no organization reporting a parsonage. The number of ministers identified with the church was 30.
Another denomination first reported in Religious Bodies, 1926 edition, named the African Orthodox Church of New York (AOCoNY) also had its episcopal see in New York City and incorporated in New York. The was in a fellowship "strictly one of spiritual communion" with the and a distinct organization with "absolute independence." It claimed three organizations, with a membership of 717 with one church edifice. There was one organization reporting a parsonage. The number of ministers identified with the church was not reported.
The African Orthodox Church originally attracted mostly Anglican West Indian immigrants. It spread to the South in 1925 when McGuire started a parish in West Palm Beach, Florida. Two years later he consecrated an African, Daniel William Alexander, as Primate of the Province of South Africa and central and southern Africa. At this time McGuire was elected as patriarch with the title of Alexander I. The church then spread to British Uganda and British Kenya, where it grew to about 10,000. A congregation also developed in Nassau, Bahamas.
In 1932 a bishop of the church went to Uganda and ordained Ruben Spartus Mukasa and one of his associates there priests of the African Orthodox Church. However, a few years later, Mukasa and his followers decided to align with the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Mukasa went to Alexandria and was ordained by the patriarch there, while the African Orthodox Church lost its connection in Uganda.
The St. John William Coltrane Church in San Francisco was founded in 1971 and joined the AOC in 1982.
Relationship to the Oriental Syriac Patriarchate
A notice from the Syriac Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East concerning schismatic bodies and , dated December 10, 1938, states that "after direct expulsion from official Christian communities" some schismatic bodies exist, including "all the sects claiming succession through Vilatte," that claim "without truth to derive their origin and apostolic succession from some ancient Apostolic Church of the East" and
The notice named the specifically as an example of such schismatic bodies.

The Shining Hour is a 1938 American romantic drama film directed by Frank Borzage, based on the 1934 play
The Shining Hour by Keith Winter, and starring Joan Crawford and Margaret Sullavan. The supporting cast of the MGM film features Robert Young, Melvyn Douglas, Fay Bainter and Hattie McDaniel.
Plot
Olivia Riley (Joan Crawford), a New York City nightclub dancer, tires of the fast life and consents to marry Henry Linden (Melvyn Douglas), a wealthy farmer from Wisconsin. Even before they engage to be married, however, Henry's brother David (Robert Young) is sent to New York by their domineering sister Hannah (Fay Bainter) to dissuade him from marrying Olivia. In private, Olivia slaps David when her integrity is questioned, but she marries Henry because she says he's the only person in her life who is endlessly positive. When Olivia moves to her new husband's farm in Wisconsin, she encounters trouble from her sister-in-law Hannah, who does not approve of her. Olivia finds an ally in David's wife, Judy (Margaret Sullavan), who is in a loveless marriage.
Olivia comes to realize that she and Judy are in the same situation. Olivia's situation is further complicated when David defends her from the unwanted advances of a farm hand and he begins to fall in love with her. Henry is unaware of this, but when Hannah finds out what is going on, she sets fire to the home in a drunken rage. Olivia saves a badly burned Judy, and David realizes he has loved Judy after all. Olivia then decides to leave the farm; and, as she drives away, Henry joins her and they leave together.

On 19 April 2017, he committed to play college basketball for South Florida over offers from Old Dominion, Oregon State and St. John's, among others. He had been discovered by South Florida's assistant coach Tom Herrion.
College career
Yetna was ruled ineligible for his first season at South Florida by the National Collegiate Athletic Association because he had played prep basketball two years after graduating from high school in France. On 15 December 2018, Yetna recorded 13 points and a freshman season-high 18 rebounds in a 76–69 win over Appalachian State. On 26 January 2019, he posted a season-high 28 points and 13 rebounds in a 77–57 victory over East Carolina. Yetna sustained a hamstring injury against Memphis in February 2019. Yetna was a four-time American Athletic Conference (AAC) Freshman of the Week and was named AAC Freshman of the Year. As a freshman, he averaged 12.3 points and 9.6 rebounds per game, leading the AAC in rebounding and double-doubles (15). He grabbed 346 rebounds, the most by a freshman in school and AAC history. Yetna missed his entire next season after suffering a left knee injury in practice. He underwent surgery for the injury. As a junior, he averaged 9.5 points and 7.3 rebounds per game, missing six games with an ankle injury. After the season, Yetna transferred to Seton Hall, choosing the Pirates over UConn.
National team career
Yetna played for France at the 2017 FIBA U20 European Championship in Greece. He averaged three points and 3.6 rebounds per game, helping his team win the bronze medal.

Otto Walter Heinrich Oscar Brune (10 January 1901 – 1982) undertook some key investigations into network synthesis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he graduated in 1929. His doctoral thesis was supervised by Wilhelm Cauer and Ernst Guillemin, who the latter ascribed to Brune the laying of "the mathematical foundation for modern realization theory".
Biography
Brune was born in Bloemfontein, Orange Free State 10 January 1901 and grew up in Kimberley, Cape Colony. He enrolled at the University of Stellenbosch in 1918, receiving a Bachelor of Science in 1920 and Master of Science in 1921. He taught German, mathematics, and science at the Potchefstroom Gymnasium, Transvaal in 1922, and lectured in mathematics at the Transvaal University College, Pretoria 1923–1925.
In 1926 Brune moved to the US to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under the sponsorship of the General Electric Company, receiving Batchelor and Master's degrees in 1929. From 1929 to 1930, Brune was involved in artificial lightning tests on the power transmission line from Croton Dam, Michigan as a research assistant at MIT. From 1930, Brune was a Fellow in Electrical Engineering at MIT with an Austin Research Fellowship.
Brune returned to South Africa in 1935. He became Principal Research Officer at the National Research Laboratories, Pretoria.
Works
In 1933, Brune was working on his doctoral thesis entitled, Synthesis of Passive Networks and Cauer suggested that he provide a proof of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the realisability of multi-port impedances. Cauer himself had found a necessary condition but had failed to prove it to be sufficient. The goal for researchers then was "to remove the restrictions implicit in the Foster-Cauer realisations and find conditions on Z equivalent to realisability by a network composed of arbitrary interconnections of positive-valued R, C and L."
Brune coined the term positive-real (PR) for that class of analytic functions that are realisable as an electrical network using passive components. He did not only introduce the mathematical characterization of this function in one complex variable but also demonstrated "the necessity and sufficiency for the realization of driving point functions of lumped, linear, finite, passive, time-invariant and bilateral network. Brune also showed that if the case is limited to scalar PR functions then there was no other theoretical reason that required ideal transformers in the realisation (transformers limit the practical usefulness of the theory), but was unable to show (as others later did) that transformers can always be avoided. The eponymous Brune cycle continued fractions were invented by Brune to facilitate this proof.
The Brune theorem is: The impedance Z(s) of any electric network composed of passive components is positive-real.
If Z(s) is positive-real it is realisable by a network having as components passive (positive) R, C, L, and ideal transformers T.
Brune is also responsible for the Brune test for determining the permissibility of interconnecting two-port networks.
Legacy
For his work, Brune is recognized as one of those who laid the foundation of network analysis by means of mathematics. For instance, American computer scientist Ernst Guillemin dedicated his book Synthesis of Passive Network to Brune, describing him with these words: "In my opinion the one primarily responsible for establishing a very broad and mathematically rigorous basis for realization theory generally was Otto Brune."

Explosives safety originated as a formal program in the United States in the aftermath of World War I when some ammunition storage areas were destroyed in a series of mishaps. The most serious occurred at Picatinny Arsenal Ammunition Storage Depot, New Jersey, in July, 1926 when an electrical storm led to fires that caused explosions and widespread destruction. The severe property damage and 19 fatalities led Congress to empower a board of Army and Naval officers to investigate the Picatinny Arsenal disaster and determine if similar conditions existed at other ammunition depots. The board reported in its findings that this mishap could recur, prompting Congress to establish a permanent board of colonels to develop explosives safety standards and ensure compliance beginning in 1928. This organization evolved into the Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) and is chartered in Title 10 of the US Code. The DDESB authors Defense Explosives Safety Regulation (DESR) 6055.9 which establishes the explosives safety standards for the Department of Defense. The DDESB also evaluates scientific data which may adjust those standards, reviews and approves all explosives site plans for new construction, and conducts worldwide visits to locations containing US title munitions. The cardinal principle of explosives safety is expose the minimum number of people for the minimum time to the minimum amount of explosives.
US Air Force
The United States Air Force counterpart to the DDESB is the Air Force Safety Center (AFSEC/SEW). Similar safety functions are found at major command headquarters, intermediate command headquarters, and installation weapons safety offices, culminating with unit-level explosives safety programs. The current Air Force regulation governing explosives safety is Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 91-201. AFMAN 91-201 was developed using DESR 6055.09 as a parent regulation, and in most cases follows the limitations set forth in the DESR (excluding mission-specific requirements). The Air Force deviates from DESR 6055.9 as long as the risks of doing so are assessed and accepted at the appropriate level.
US Army
The United States Army counterpart to the DDESB is the U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety (USATCES). The USATCES is located with the Defense Ammunition Center on McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, near McAlester, Oklahoma . USATCES is responsible for providing ammunition and explosives (A&E) safety worldwide by acting as the field office of the Department of Army Safety responsible for A&E safety. The USATCES also acts as the Army agency having safety oversight of clean-up of Former Used Defense Sites (FUDS) and Former Toxic Chemical Agent Sites where munitions from all branches of service disposed of A&E by burial or dumping up until the end of the Vietnam War. The USATCES acts as the Army's safety watchdog for disposal of chemical ammunition at the Army's Chemical Disposal Facilities. As part of Army's Ordnance Corps under TRADOC Specially trained Civilian Explosives Safety Personnel [Quality Assurance Specialist (Ammunition Surveillance) (QASAS)] and Safety Specialist that have received specialized training in A&E Safety) from the USATCES are deployed worldwide, wherever the U.S. Army has A&E. Their mission is to provide A&E safety to the soldier, the public, and the environment making sure the Army's A&E is not only stored safely but ready, reliable, and lethal when the U.S. military needs it.
Net Explosives Weight (NEW)
The net explosives weight (NEW) is the total weight of all explosives substances in a single item. NEW is used to calculate safe separation distances (see Quantity-Distance). NEW for a specific explosive may be adjusted by its TNT equivalence which is the weight of trinitrotoluene (TNT) required to produce a shockwave of equal magnitude as that produced by one pound of the explosive in question. For example, C-4 has a TNT equivalency for overpressure of 1.34 (one pound of C-4 is equal to 1.34 pounds of TNT).
Quantity-Distance (QD)
Quantity-Distance (QD) is the foundation of DOD explosives safety standards. It defines levels of protection from blast based on relationships between the quantity of explosive material (NEW) and distance. The relationships are based on levels of risk considered acceptable for specific exposures but they do not provide absolute safety or protection. Exposures are expressed by a “K-factor” (K6, K18, etc.) which represents the degree of protection provided; higher is better. K328 equates to a blast overpressure of which will not harm people in the open.
Blast Wave Phenomena
A Blast Wave Phenomenon is an incident involving the violent release of energy created by detonation of an explosive device. The sudden and intense pressure disturbance is termed the “blast wave.” The blast wave is characterized by an almost instantaneous rise from ambient pressure to a peak incident pressure (Pi). This pressure increase or “shock front,” travels radially outward from the detonation point, with a diminishing velocity that is always in excess of the speed of sound in that medium. Gas molecules making up the front move at lower velocities. This velocity, which is called the “particle velocity,” is associated with the “dynamic pressure,” or the pressure formed by the winds produced by the shock front. As the shock front expands into increasingly larger volumes of the medium, the incident pressure decreases and, generally, the duration of the pressure-pulse increase. If the shock wave strikes a rigid surface (e.g., a building) at an angle to the direction of the wave's propagation, a reflected pressure is instantly developed on the surface and this pressure rises to a value that exceeds the incident pressure. This reflected pressure is a function of the incident wave's pressure and the angle formed between the rigid surface and the plane of the shock front.
Fragments
An important consideration in the analysis of the hazards associated with an explosion is the effect of any fragments produced. Although fragmentation most commonly occurs in high explosives events, fragmentation may occur in any incident involving ammunition and explosives (A&E). Depending on their origin, fragments are referred to as “primary” or “secondary” fragments.
Primary fragments result from the shattering of a container (e.g., shell casings, kettles, hoppers, and other containers used in the manufacture of explosives and rocket engine housings) in direct contact with the explosive. These fragments usually are small, initially travel at thousands of feet per second, and may be lethal at long distances from an explosion.
Secondary fragments are debris from structures and other items in close proximity to the explosion. These fragments, which are somewhat larger in size than primary fragments and initially travel at hundreds of feet per second, do not normally travel as far as primary fragments.
Thermal Hazards
Generally, thermal hazards from explosives events are of less concern than blast and fragment hazards. With the release of energy from an explosion is heat. The amount of heat varies with the energetic compound (explosive). All explosives compound molecules are potentially unstable held together with weak bonds in their outer shell. When this weak bond is broken heat and energy is violently released. It normally takes longer for the thermal blast to incur. Injury from thermal effects follows the blast and fragmentation effects which happen almost instantaneously. This does not imply that there is a time lapse between blast and fragmentation effects of explosives; in fact it happens so fast that humans cannot notice the delay without specialized equipment. The time available to react to a thermal event does increase survivability by rapid equipment designed to react in a fragment of a second. The primary effect of the thermal effect from an explosive detonation on structures, material, and ammunition and explosives (A&E) is their partial or total destruction by fire. The primary concern for explosives safety with a fire involving A&E is that it may transition to a more severe reaction, causing detonations of additional or more hazardous explosives devises and placing more people or property at a greater degree of risk of damage, destruction, injury, or death.
Susan Test
Following the 1966 Palomares B-52 crash and the 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash, accident investigators concluded that the conventional explosives used at the time in nuclear weapons were not stable enough to withstand the forces involved in an aircraft accident. The finding triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives that could be used in nuclear weapons. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory developed the "Susan Test" — a standard test that uses a special projectile whose design simulates an aircraft accident by squeezing and nipping explosive material between metal surfaces. The test projectile is fired under controlled conditions at a hard surface to measure the reactions and thresholds of different explosives to an impact.
Explosives Safety Specialist
This is a highly trained and skilled civilian professional usually a QASAS or a Safety Specialist that has been trained to evaluate risk and hazards involved with conventional, guided missiles and toxic chemical ammunition operations. Department of Defense Standards requires that only trained and certified personnel are permitted to participate in operations involving ammunition, explosives, and/or explosive components, guided missiles, and toxic chemicals. They are responsible for providing protection from the effects of ammunition and explosives by evaluation of a set of standards developed by the Department of Defense and reinforced by additional regulations by the branch of military service responsible for the explosives item.
They develop safety programs to minimize losses due to injuries and property damage. They try to eliminate unsafe practices and conditions on sites where ammunition and explosives (A&E) are used or stored. Military explosives safety specialist are deployed along with U.S. Military forces to maintain safe storage and use of A&E. They are responsible to recommend to military command ways to store A&E that reduce the risk of injury or death to service men and women in case of an accidental detonation or if the A&E supply is hit by enemy attack.
Much of the work of military explosives safety specialist is identical to their civilian counterparts. They have offices where they analyze data and write reports to upper commands on the storage of A&E. Much of their time is spent reviewing or preparing explosives safety site plans. An explosives site plan (ESS) is the composite risk management (CRM) process associated with explosives/toxic chemical activities to ensure the minimum risk to personnel, equipment, and assets, while meeting mission requirements. The damage or injury potential of explosions is determined by the separation distance between potential explosion sites (PES) and exposed sites (ES); the ability of the PES to suppress blast overpressure, primary and secondary fragments; and the ability of the ES to resist explosion effects. Planning for the proper location and construction of A&E facilities and surrounding facilities exposed to A&E facilities is a key element of the explosives/toxic chemical site planning process. This management process also ensures that risks above those normally accepted for A&E activities are identified and approved at the proper level of command.
Explosives Safety Specialist must often travel to different storage sites to verify that the military installation is meeting the service explosives safety regulations.
Explosives Safety Specialist often works with other safety professionals. They are required to know OSHA, EPA, NFPA and other consensus standards when looking at safety and if these regulations are stricter than their service regulation they must apply these standards and regulations. They must also know Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) regulations dealing with A&E and apply those standards if it is required. They must be able to convince people the need for following prescribes explosives safety standards/regulations. They must also work with ammunition cleanup sites insuring that safety laws and regulations as well as industry standards are followed. They should be good at solving problems.
The military is not the only industry to use explosives safety specialist but are by far the largest employer. Mining and construction also use explosives safety specialist to evaluate hazard and risk from explosives and blasting operations. Ammunition and explosives manufactures also use these professionals. Outside the military explosives safety specialist must apply and be knowledgeable of ATF, OSHA, EPA, NFPA, as well as state and local regulations dealing with safety of A&E.

The northern brushtail possum (Trichosurus arnhemensis) is a nocturnal marsupial inhabiting northern Australia. The northern brushtail possum is sometimes considered a species, however more often than not is considered a subspecies of the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula arnhemensis).
Lifestyle
Possums are nocturnal in nature, so feed between dawn and dusk. They are territorial creatures and can be found alone or in family groups.
Appearance
Its fur is a grey in colour, with a white underbelly and pink skin. The northern brushtail possum can grow up to in length, not including its tail, and is around the size of a small cat. Unlike its relatives and despite what its name suggests, the northern brushtail possum does not have a bushy tail.
Lifespan and reproduction
The northern brushtail possum breeds year-round, with a gestation period around 17–18 days and pouch period of 4–5 months. It can live up to 15 years.
Diseases
Many of the NT possums are found to have contracted a flesh eating bacteria. This causes their faces to be eaten away and often results in blindness. The disease has been widely spread within the possum community, also affecting Ringtail possums. Possums brought into the local RSPCA after contracting the disease are commonly put down. Once the possums contract the sickness they are often found to be more welcoming to humans, and will approach when practical.
Relationship with humans
The northern brushtail possum is well adapted to rural and urban areas and is sometimes considered a pest when found in high numbers. Like other possums, it is rather tolerant of humans and can sometimes be hand fed, although it is not encouraged, as its claws are quite sharp and can cause infection or disease to humans if scratched.
It is a traditional food source for some Indigenous Australians. In the Kunwinjku language it is known as djebuyh. According to Reverend P. Nganjmirra, Kunwinjku elder, it tastes "good". It is cooked in a hole like bandicoot.
Diet
The northern brushtail possum eats a variety of plant matter, including fruit, leaves, flowers, and seeds. Brushtail possums are known to be tolerant of many plant toxins and can eat tree leaves that other animals find poisonous. Possums also eat insects, moths, grubs, snails, birds' eggs, and chicks. Many of the possums' favourite foods are unfortunately found in domestic gardens, drawing the possums into residential yards.

At least two destructive tornadoes struck Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on Friday, July 6, 2001. The strongest of the two was a slow-moving F2 tornado that was caught on camera moving down the beach, injuring 39. In all, the tornadoes caused $8.8 million in damage.
Confirmed tornadoes
July 6 event
Other possible tornadoes
Near southern Myrtle Beach, evidence was found for three other damage paths that were estimated to have F0 and F1 strength. These tornadoes caused roof and tree damage. However, they were not added to the official database.
Aftermath
The storm that produced these tornadoes occurred during the Fourth of July weekend as an estimated 400,000 vacationers were at Myrtle Beach. Damage from the tornadoes is estimated to be up to $8,000,000 - with an estimated $1,000,000 damages associated with vehicles. 4,000 residents were without power during the worst parts of the storm.

This is not to be confused with the poem by Gilbert Frankau.
The Voice of the Guns (1917) is a British military march composed by Kenneth Alford during World War I. It was written as a tribute to British artillerymen serving in the war, hence its name, though later became widely adopted by the entire British army.
The piece is generally arranged for a full marching band or orchestra, though piano and organ versions have also been composed. Maurice Jarre's score used an arrangement for piccolos (in lieu of fifes) with drums within his overture for "Lawrence Of Arabia", and he also rearranged the piece for a military band, assembled from the London Philharmonic Orchestra, which segues in an out of fragmentary motifs from the 'Lawrence' theme, later during the film. It is to be remarked that Jarre's arrangement of the march is quite different from the original, and it does not utilize the original 6-bar introduction.
The song starts out with three brief musical phrases, followed by a segue into the main triumphant, fast-moving marching theme which remains throughout the rest of the piece. The full version of the piece generally lasts about three minutes, though longer and shorter arrangements have also been made.
An arrangement of it was famously used in David Lean's film Lawrence of Arabia (1962), to represent British Empire military power. Its most notable use in the film occurs during the scene when Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) and General Allenby (Jack Hawkins) discuss strategy while descending the stairs of the British army headquarters in Cairo.
Today the piece remains a popular selection for marching bands and orchestras. In 1983 the quick march of the Royal Artillery, "British Grenadiers" (in use by the regiment since 1762) was extended, by Lt. Col. Stanley Patch, to include the Trio section from "The Voice Of The Guns", in honour of the Royal Artillery's Captain General, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The tune British Grenadiers used by the Royal Artillery bands differs from that of the Grenadier Guards only by having different horn parts; other than that they are identical. Its association with the Royal Artillery predates the formation of the Grenadier Guards Regiment, and the Royal Artillery were the first British regiment to use the French grenate, or grenade. The Royal Artillery were also the first British regiment to adopt the grenade as a badge symbol.

Zutendaal Air Base is a reserve Belgian Air Component base, located east-southeast of Genk (Limburg), approximately east-northeast of Brussels.
Overview
The base is in reserve status, its primary use being to store retired Agusta helicopters. Since 2009, it has been open to limited civilian recreational flying; it is home to a gliding club, operating on the weekends.
History
Origins
Zutendaal Air Base's origins date to March 1917 when it was originally constructed by the German Army Air Corps as "Flieger Schießschule". it was established for observers destined for artillery units. Near this airfield, the Germans selected a large heath area (between Houthalen, Genk, As, Peer and Opglabbeek) where they installed a firing range.
After World War I, the name of the airfield was changed to Asch (as it was spelled at the time) and it became the Flying School of the Belgian Military Aviation, later in March 1920 called Aéronautique Militaire. Situated 2 km SW of the town centre of As, this school had a large 1100 by 800 metres grass airfield at its disposal and several metal hangars and brick support buildings. After the Flying School was abandoned in 1924, the airfield was closed to make room for the proposed construction of a canal, and moved to Wevelgem, the field gradually became a dense wooded area.
World War II
In November 1944 a new airfield near the World War I aerodrome was constructed by the United States Army Air Forces IX Engineer Command, 852nd and 846th Engineer Aviation Battalions. Known as Advanced Landing Ground "Y-29", the airfield consisted of a single 5000 foot (1500m) Sod runway aligned 06/24. In addition, tents were erected for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump was created for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water; and a minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting was installed.
Asch was home to North American P-51 Mustangs of the 352nd Fighter Group, Eighth Air Force (which included the 328th Fighter Squadron, led by George Preddy); and P-47 Thunderbolts from 366th Fighter Group, Ninth Air Force, from 19 November 1944 – 11 April 1945. The 406th Fighter Group, also flew from the airfield in P-47s from 8 February – 15 April 1945. The fighter planes flew support missions, patrolling roads in front of the beachhead; strafing German military vehicles and dropping bombs on gun emplacements, anti-aircraft artillery and concentrations of German troops when spotted.
On January 1, 1945, Asch airfield was the site of a major aerial battle during the Luftwaffe's Operation Bodenplatte. The Fw 190s and Bf 109s of JG-11 arrived at Asch just as the 487th FS of the 352nd FG were rolling down the runway, the ensuing battle came to be known as the Legend of Y-29 and encapsulated the failure of Operation Bodenplatte as a whole. The pilots of the 487th Fighter Squadron who took off did so under fire and in the face of overwhelming odds. The 487th scored 23 kills while suffering only 2 damaged aircraft in the face of 3:1 odds. For their performance the 487th received the only Distinguished Unit Citation given to a fighter squadron in the European theatre.
When the fighter units moved out, the 391st Bombardment Group flew B-26 Marauder medium bombers from the airfield until 27 May 1945. With the end of the war in Europe, the airfield was closed on 20 June 1945.
Belgian Air Force
After the war, the airfield was taken over by the Belgian Air Force. It was later rebuilt into a permanent facility with hard surfaced runways and support buildings. Currently it is used by the Belgian Army as a storage depot.

Franz Martin Hilgendorf (5 December 1839 – 5 July 1904) was a German zoologist and paleontologist. Hilgendorf's research on fossil snails from the Steinheim crater in the early 1860s became a palaeontological evidence for the theory of evolution published by Charles Darwin in 1859.
Life and work
Franz Hilgendorf was born on 5 December 1839 in Neudamm (Mark Brandenburg). Between 1851 and 1854 he went to a gymnasium in Königsberg (Neumark) and later to the Gymnasium Zum Grauen Kloster (Grey Monastery) in Berlin where he graduated in 1858. In 1859 he started studying philology at the University of Berlin. After four semesters he changed to the University of Tübingen. In the summer of 1862 he joined an excavation by Friedrich August Quenstedt in the Steinheim crater. In 1863 Hilgendorf received his Ph.D. for work related to this excavation. He finished his research on the fossils during his time at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin.
In 1868, Hilgendorf became director of the aquarium of the Zoological Garden of Hamburg and in 1870 and 1871 he worked as librarian at the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In 1873 Hilgendorf was appointed lecturer at the Imperial Medical Academy Tokyo. He stayed in Japan from 1873 till 1876 and published articles and collected several specimens of Japanese fauna. He returned to Germany with his collection and worked in the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin. He was first responsible for the worms and snails section and from 1896, the fish section.
He proposed 36 new species of Japanese fish, 25 of these are valid today.
Hilgendorf suffered from a gastric illness. He stopped working in 1903 and died from that illness on 5 July 1904.
Taxon named in his honor
In 1890 Gustav Wilhelm Müller identified a new species of ostracod crustacean in the collection of Hilgendorf and named it Cypridina hilgendorfii. This name changed to Vargula hilgendorfii in 1962. Another fish named after Hilgendorf is Helicolenus hilgendorfii of Japan, described in 1884 by Ludwig Döderlein.
The fish Pungtungia hilgendorfi (Jordan & Fowler, 1903) was named in his honor.
The Tetra Alestopetersius hilgendorfi (Boulenger), 1899 is named after him.
Evolution
Hilgendorf took his doctoral degree in May 1863. His thesis included information on the phylogeny of Planorbis multiformis, a gastropod. He suggested that these organisms had evolved, however, his thesis was never published. His 1866 publication which described the phylogeny of Planorbis multiformis in detail has been described as "one of the most important contributions of paleontology to early Darwinism". Darwin acknowledged the findings of Hilgendorf and referred to his research in the sixth edition of On the Origin of Species, 1872.
He was the first to construct a phylogenetic tree based on fossil evidence. Hilgendorf has been described as the first scientist to introduce Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory to Japan in 1873.
In 1877 he discovered the mollusc Pleurotomaria berichii on the coast near Tokyo and described it as a living fossil.

History
Billy James of the syndicated morning radio show John Boy and Billy based in Charlotte, started his career at WADA, the previous call sign of WOHS.
The station was originally licensed in 1958 as WADA. Debbie A. Clary became president and general manager of WADA in 1986 and later made the decision to change from country music to talk radio. WADA was one of the first radio stations in the Charlotte area to carry Rush Limbaugh, airing the show even before 1110 WBT. Clary became a state legislator in 1995 and sold the radio station in 1999. Edwin Johnson sold the station to HRN Broadcasting in 2006.
In 2004, Tim Biggerstaff, a DJ for more than 20 years, was still hosting his show on WCSL and WLON despite diabetes-related health problems. Later he moved to Lincolnton-based Hometown Radio's Shelby operation. On WADA he played classic country music, and he hosted a "Swap Shop" show on WGNC and WOHS. By this time he had experienced a kidney transplant and two pancreas transplants. On Memorial Day 2007, while on the air, Biggerstaff had a seizure and asked for help on the air, and a listener called 911. He ended up being interviewed by BBC London, Today and People Magazine.
On January 5, 2009, WADA returned to the former WOHS studios in Shelby after having been located in Lincolnton. Calvin Hastings, president of KTC Broadcasting and the station's morning host, said, "All we want to be is a hometown radio station." Hastings said the station would air local and professional sports and that Andy Foster and David Allen would return. KTC was leasing the station but planned to buy it, which led to the move.
On December 21, 2011 Inside Radio reported that KTC Broadcasting had filed to purchase WOHS from HRN Broadcasting for $225,000.
In 2010, WADA changed its call letters to WOHS. On August 8, 2016 WOHS changed its format from classic country to oldies, branded as "The Boss."

Lanarkopterus is a genus of prehistoric eurypterid with one recognised species, Lanarkopterus dolichoschelus. Lanarkopterus was long seen as a species of the closely related Mixopterus, though more complete specimens discovered in the 1960s determined that it differed in several aspects, enough to warrant a separate genus.
Specimens of the genus have been recovered from deposits of Late Silurian age in Scotland.
Description
Lanarkopterus was a small to moderately large (ranging in size from less than 10 centimeters to over 30 centimeters) mixopterid eurypterid that like its close relative Mixopterus appeared almost scorpion-like with a broad and trilobed preabdomen, a narrow and tapering postabdomen and a sharped and curved telsonic spine.
History of discovery
Specimens of Lanarkopterus were first noted by Peach and Horne (1899) in the Ludlowian fish beds of the Lesmahagow and Hagshaw Hills Silurian inliers in Ayrshire and Lanarkshire, Scotland. Fragments of the genus, then referred to Eurypterus, were recovered from many localities that also yielded Silurian vertebrates such as Birkenia, Lasanius, Thelodus, Lanarkia and Atleleaspis.
Størmer (1936) described several specimens of Mixopterus from Ludlowian deposits of Ringerike, Norway. The specimens referred to Eurypterus dolichoschelus were described in further detail and referred to Mixopterus. An almost complete, but weathered specimen (T. 3357) from the collection of the Geological Survey of Scotland, in Edinburgh, was taken as the holotype of Mixopterus dolichoschelus.
Further specimens discovered during the second half of the twentieth century and ones discovered in several national and university museum collections allowed a full description of the morphology and a more accurate assessment of the taxonomic position of the species. Ritchie (1968) presented evidence that suggested that M. dolichoschelus was not as closely related to the other species of Mixopterus as previously thought and placed it in its own genus within the Mixopteridae, Lanarkopterus.

Lake Rotokākahi or Green Lake, is one of four small lakes lying between Lake Rotorua and Lake Tarawera in the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand's North Island. The others are Lake Tikitapu (Blue Lake), Lake Okareka, and Lake Okataina. All lie within the Okataina caldera, along its western edge.
Named for its abundance of (freshwater mussels), the lake flows to Lake Tarawera via the Te Wairoa waterfalls. From the air the lake looks emerald green due to its shallow, sandy bottom. The lake is 394 metres above sea level and 24 metres below the level of the neighbouring Lake Tikitapu.
The lake remains under the authority of Te Arawa iwi, Tūhourangi, and remains largely undisturbed as it is considered to be (sacred).
Motutawa
This small island in the lake is notable as the site of the 1822 slaughter of a part of Ngāpuhi, that led to the revenge raid of Hongi Hika in 1823—and also as the resting place of the bones of Hinemoa.

Banatski Brestovac () is a village located in the Municipality of Pančevo, in the South Banat District of Serbia. It is situated in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The village has a Serbian ethnic majority and its population numbers 3,251 people (2011 census).
Name
The name of the village refers to the stands of elm trees which surrounded the village. The name of the village is of Serbian origin, and a legend about origin of the name claims that the village was first settled by Rascian people from the village of Brestovik located on the southern bank of the Danube.
In Serbian, the village is known as Banatski Brestovac, in Hungarian as Beresztóc (official name from 1898 to 1918) and in German as Brestowatz (official name Rustendorf from March 1943 to September 1944).
Geography
The village is located near the Ponjavica river at , approximately 21 km SE of Pančevo, 37 km SE of Pančevo bridge to Belgrade and 26 km NW of Smederevo.
Since 1995, there is a protected nature park Ponjavica south of the village.
There is a camp and a village called Jabukov Cvet (serbian for apple flower, because of apple plantation located there) near Banatski Brestovac. Jabukov Cvet is known tourist destination of that area. The camp is visited by many international tourists during the year.
History
The official year of founding of Brestovac is 1717, but it is only documented an abandoned settlement with 12 uninhabited houses in that time. The communal area was a part of Temeşvar Eyalet in Ottoman Empire since 1552, after the Treaty of Požarevac a part of Habsburg's Banat, since 1765 of the military frontier (Austrian Empire) and then it belonged to the Torontál county of Austria-Hungary. After World War I was that area a part of provisional Torontalsko-tamiške županja (Treaty of Trianon), in 1922 of Belgrade oblast and since 1929 of the Danube Banovina in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In the time after World War II its belonged to the Srez Pančevo of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The communal area of Banatski Brestovac was a part of the administrative region of the Pančevo municipality from all these centuries to the present.
There is an impression of the old village which is recorded on the map of the Franciscan land survey from the early 19th century at the National Archives of Austria. In 1902, cadastral maps of the village were recorded which are located at the National Archives of Hungary.
Historical population
Economy
The main occupation of the people is in agriculture, as with many other local settlements. Since several years, there is an annual event named Paprikijada in the village, organized by an economic and cultural association of local women called Aktiv Žena Sosa. During the event, all kinds of paprika are sold, culinary tastings of dishes offered, and the biggest and most beautiful paprika is chosen.

During his time at Purdue University, between 1978 and 1982, Williams was a four-year letterman for the Boilermakers football team and a captain in his senior season. He started for three years in the secondary, after spending his freshman season at running back. He graduated in 1982 with a degree in general management.
Coaching career
After spending one season as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, Williams got his first coaching position as a running back and secondary coach at Ball State, where he remained for two seasons. He spent the next five seasons as an offensive backfield coach at Eastern Michigan.
On December 6, 1999, Williams was named as the head coach of the Michigan State Spartans football team. Williams coached the Spartans to a 37–34 win over Florida in the 2000 Citrus Bowl in his first game as head coach. In his first full season as head coach, the Spartans began their 2000 season 3–0, with wins over Marshall, Missouri, and Notre Dame, before losing four consecutive and finishing the season 5–6. The Spartans did improve in the following season, though were inconsistent, and finished the regular season 6–5, which included a win versus rival Michigan in the infamous "Clockgate" game. In the 2001 Silicon Valley Football Classic, Michigan State defeated Fresno State 44–35, finishing the season 7–5 and giving Williams his second bowl victory. With the victory, he became the first coach in Spartans history to win his first two bowl games. Nearing the end of his third season, Michigan State was 3–6 and last place in the Big Ten when the Spartans decided to fire Williams as head coach.
After leaving Michigan State, Williams went into the NFL as a wide receiver coach for the Detroit Lions. During his time with the Lions, he was reunited with wide receiver Charles Rogers, whom he had recruited and coached at MSU. After one season in the NFL, Williams returned to college as a wide receiver coach, as well as an assistant head coach under Nick Saban at LSU. After Saban left LSU for the Miami Dolphins, Williams followed him to become a running back coach for the team several months later. However, after two seasons with the Dolphins, Williams was fired at his position. On January 18, 2008, Williams again rejoined Saban at Alabama, accepting the position of tight end and special teams coordinator.
Personal life
Williams is married to Sheila Williams. The couple has two children: a daughter, Nataly, member of the Theta Sigma chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and a son, Nicholas who is an offensive quality control coach with the New York Giants.

The optic foramen is the opening to the optic canal. The canal is located in the sphenoid bone; it is bounded medially by the body of the sphenoid and laterally by the lesser wing of the sphenoid.
The superior surface of the sphenoid bone is bounded behind by a ridge, which forms the anterior border of a narrow, transverse groove, the chiasmatic groove (optic groove), above and behind which lies the optic chiasma; the groove ends on either side in the optic foramen, which transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery (with accompanying sympathetic nerve fibres) into the orbital cavity. Compared to the optic nerve, the ophthalmic artery is located inferolaterally within the canal.
The left and right optic canals are 25mm apart posteriorly and 30mm apart anteriorly. The canals themselves are funnel-shaped (narrowest anteriorly).

The Emperor's railway station or Emperor's Tsarskoye Selo Station, known as the Emperor's Pavilion (, transliteration Imperatorsky pavilyon), is a former railway station terminal in Russia, in the town Tsarskoye Selo (now Pushkin, Saint Petersburg), which served the last monarch of Russia Emperor Nicholas II with his family and courtiers over his dedicated that eventually consisted of three lines to link the capital city of the empire, Saint Petersburg, with two of the suburban royal residences in the towns of Tsarskoye Selo (Rus. "Royal Village") and Gatchina. The Tsarskoye Selo Alexander Palace and Park estate was home to Nicholas and his family for their last 13 years. The Russian royal family had two other private railway station terminals named Emperor's Pavilions - one in and another one at Saint Petersburg Vitebsky railway station.
Map
The first station
In 1895, at the beginning of the reign of Tsar Nicholas II, a pavilion was built to accommodate the Imperial family when traveling by train from St. Petersburg to the Alexandrovskaya station, which served Tsarskoye Selo. Approved on 30 June 1895, a wooden Imperial Pavilion with a covered platform was built. The pavilion was asymmetrical in plan and had only 4 rooms. The total area of the building was 24.38 square meters. A year later, on 9 August 1896, a project for an extension to the Imperial Pavilion was approved.
The total area of the pavilion increased to 41.7 square meters. The so-called Imperial branch of the Moscow-Vindava-Rybinsk railway, starting at the Imperial Pavilion adjacent to the Vitebsky railway station opened in 1902. It started at Vitebsk station, where a special pavilion for the Emperor and his relatives was built in 1902. It ran parallel to the main line of the Tsarskoye Selo Railway and then branched south west at the village of Kouzmino. In 1903, the line was extended to the Imperial pavilion. It was reserved for members of the imperial family and representatives of foreign powers.
The second station
The pavilion burned down in January 1911 and a new construction project was prepared by , one of the favorite architects of Tsar Nicholas II, who had just completed the construction of the Feodorovsky cathedral, which served as a family parish church for the Emperor and his family. The railway station was completed in 1912.
A long alley of lime trees still leads to the Feodorovsky Imperial Cathedral and then a paved road leads to the Alexander Palace, located one kilometer from the station.
After the revolution the station was renamed " Uritsky Pavilion" in 1918 and closed a few years after the Second World War. The pavilion itself suffered from damage during the German occupation.
Architecture
The style of the pavilion is Russian Revival architecture, as with the Feodorovsky Village and its buildings (the cathedral, the personal guardhouse of the Emperor, the Palace of Arms, etc.) which are all nearby. The platforms were two hundred meters long and were covered for a hundred metres. The entrance had a porch with a pointed roof supported by four pillars and surmounted by a double-headed eagle decorated with kokoshniks. The interior of the pavilion is adorned with frescoes imitating 16th-century Moscovite frescoes, carried out by the artists of the Moscow workshop of the "Heirs of P. P. Pashkov" under the supervision of its co-owner Nikolai Pavlovich Pashkov.
Current Condition
During the 1990s the building was used as an unofficial disco until it suffered a fire.
On 18 March 2008, the Property Fund held tenders for the sale of rights to conclude lease agreements for the pavilion building, which was to be named "Tsarskoye Selo Station" (Pushkin, Academic Ave, 35b, lit. A). The auction winner was OOO Sansara, which concluded the contract for a period of 49 years. The possible use of the building was as a shopping mall or restaurant.
In 2010 on the 300th anniversary of Tsarskoe Selo, it was planned to restore the pavilion. But this did not happen.
The pavilion is currently almost in ruins. The sharp-pointed roof of the entrance door of honor has collapsed and been replaced with plastic coated roofing sheet. The stone carvings on the facade have survived, as well as the murals of the vaults of the front porch and some interiors have also survived. Bullet holes and shrapnel holes from the Second World War are visible on the rear / north façade where the platforms used to be. The platforms and platform canopy no longer exist.
Models
A company called Umnaya Bumaga, OOO/ "Clever Paper" produced a 1:150 card/paper model of the station building.

Tehelné pole was a neighborhood in Bratislava, Slovakia, characterized by the presence of several sports facilities. Administratively, the neighborhood belongs to Nové Mesto borough, situated around 5 km north-east of the centre. The German and Hungarian names for this locality are Ziegelfeld and Téglamező.
Football
Most commonly, the name refers to the football stadium in this district which is the home ground of Slovan Bratislava and the regular home for the Slovakia national team. The stadium has a capacity of 30,085 spectators and is 105 m long and 68 m wide. It was built during the First Slovak Republic, when Nazi Germany occupied Petržalka in 1938 and Bratislava lost almost all of its sporting facilities. The construction lasted from 1939 to 1944 and the stadium became the home ground for Slovan Bratislava. The stadium was officially opened in September 1940 with 25,000 places, and the first international match was played on 27 October 1940, with Slovan Bratislava playing against Hertha Berlin, ending in a 2–2 tie.
The old stadium underwent reconstruction in 1961, which added a second stand, boosting its capacity to 45,000, as well as a score table, artificial lighting and revamping the field. Later, the capacity was increased to 50,000, and just before the breakup of Czechoslovakia, it was the largest stadium in use (Strahov Stadium in Prague had a capacity of 220,000 but was disused in the 1990s) and was the home ground for the Czechoslovak national team.
The stadium was reconstructed once more in the 1990s to an "all-seater" stadium, reducing the capacity into 30,000. After this, the Tehelné pole stadium was the second-largest in Slovakia after Všešportový areál in Košice, however, that stadium is now disused. In 2005–06, it was also used as the "home" ground for FC Artmedia Bratislava in that club's Champions League and UEFA Cup campaigns, as Artmedia's own ground did not meet minimum standards for UEFA competitions.
It is planned that the current stadium will be demolished and a new one with the capacity around 35,000 people will be built, costing around €80 million. The need for a new stadium stems from UEFA rules requiring international matches to be played in stadiums of certain standards from 2008, however, Slovakia lacks these stadiums. In July 2009, the Slovak government decided to support the construction of new stadium. The demolition works were planned for March–April 2010 and the new stadium was planned to open in December 2017. Its capacity was planned to be 22,000 spectators with a possible enlargement to 30,000.
Lido

William Paul Cook (August 31, 1881 – January 22, 1948) was a writer, printer and publisher. He wrote under his own name and the pseudonym Willis T. Crossman and was a leading figure in the hobbyist tradition of amateur journalism. He lived and wrote mostly in Vermont and Massachusetts.
Biography
Cook was born on August 31, 1881 in Mount Tabor, Vermont. His mother died giving birth and he was raised by his aunt and uncle. He attended Dartmouth but did not graduate.
Among his works are an important memoir about H. P. Lovecraft, originally published as In Memoriam: Howard Phillips Lovecraft (Driftwind Press, 1941).; Cook typeset this himself. This memoir has been reprinted several times, including by Mirage Press in 1968 under the title H.P. Lovecraft: A Portrait. He also wrote stories about Vermont. He met Lovecraft through the National Amateur Press Association, and quickly became a champion of his weird fiction, some of which was first published in Cook's journal, The Vagrant. Cook also broadened Lovecraft's familiarity with supernatural literature by loaning him books and encouraging a systematic study of the field that resulted in Lovecraft's famous essay, "Supernatural Horror in Literature," which was first published in Cook's The Recluse (1927),of which only a single issue was published.
In addition to the various journals he published, including The Vagrant, The Recluse, The Revenant, "The Ghost", and Monadnock, Cook published books under the Recluse Press imprint. Some of them were by members of the Lovecraft Circle, such as Samuel Loveman, Frank B. Long Jr. (Frank Belknap Long), Donald Wandrei, Walter J. Coates (proprietor of The Driftwind Press), and Lovecraft himself.
Leland Hawes and Sean Donnelly edited a collection of regional stories that Cook wrote under a pseudonym, Willis T. Crossman's Vermont: Stories by W. Paul Cook (published by the University of Tampa Press). Donnelly also edited a companion volume, W. Paul Cook: The Wandering Life of a Yankee Printer, collecting writings by and about Cook, to which he contributed a long biography of Cook and a bibliography of his numerous publications. It was published by Derrick Hussey's Hippocampus Press.

Andy Gillet (born 8 July 1981) is a French fashion model and actor primarily known for his work in European Auteur cinema in such films as Éric Rohmer's Romance of Astree and Celadon (2007) or Andrzej Żuławski's Cosmos (2015). As a model Gillet represented numerous brands for their ad campaigns including Hermès, Valentino or Burberry; the last two having been shot by Mario Testino and he was the face of the fragrance 'Kenzo Power' by Kenzo Takada.
Early life and education
Gillet grew up in Sallanches in Haute Savoie, the son of a policeman and a secretary, he has a younger brother. He completed his studies at Nancy Business School and moved to Paris.
Career
Before he could manage to make a living from acting, Gillet was a theater usher but didn't have enough money to enroll in the 'Eva-Saint-Paul Drama School'. Due to his androgynous beauty, Gillet was then sent to Japan by an agency for four months to land modelling contracts but once in Tokyo, he found no work or relationship and felt lost in translation. From this failure, Gillet drew motivation declaring:"This period of hardship I went through there forced me to reflect and made me mature. I returned to France with the 'niaque': no more dilemmas, I want to play. I changed my life."He first appeared on stage in the title role of Caligula, in a celebrated staging by Charles Berling. He made his television debut in 2005, in the role of Hugh Despenser the Younger in the remake miniseries Les Rois maudits, based on the French novel series of the same name by Maurice Druon. He also appeared in series such as Éternelle and Un village français. His debut in cinema came in 2006, with Nouvelle chance by Anne Fontaine and L'homme de sa vie by Zabou Breitman. The following year, he appeared in acclaimed director Eric Rohmer's final film, Les Amours d'Astrée et de Céladon.
Private life
Gillet publicly shares on social media that his partner is musician, singer and actor Brice Michelini from Cannes who appeared in Rebecca Zlotowski's Planétarium (2016). When asked why he chose to write the song Andy, I Love You (French: Andy, Je T'aime) and have him acting in the music video, Michelini declared: "Because I love Andy. Andy, he's the man I love. This name came to me before I even made music. Andy is a muse: not just mine, a lot of people's muse. For me it was a waste to live with a muse and not do anything with it."

On 8 December 2019, a fire occurred at a factory building in Anaj Mandi area of Delhi, India. At least 43 people died and more than 56 were injured.
The fire started in a workshop that produced school bags and shoes. The Delhi Fire Service (DFS) received a call for help around 5:22 a.m. IST and reached the location within five minutes, but their entry to the building was prevented by the intensity of the fire and blockages to the entry points. Gas cutters had to be employed to remove the iron grilles. Thirty-five fire engines reached the location and extinguished the fire with an estimated 150 firemen involved who were able to rescue 63 people. A team from the National Disaster Response Force was deployed to assist the fire department in the rescue work.
According to the police, most of the people who died were labourers who had been sleeping inside the factory. Doctors stated that deaths were due to asphyxiation caused by smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. The cause of the fire is being investigated. A preliminary investigation and eye witness claims have suggested an electrical short circuit may have been the cause.
The factory was operating in a residential area and according to the local fire chief, the building lacked a proper fire license, and its use as a factory was illegal. The Delhi Police Crime Branch is investigating the case, and the owner of the building and his manager were arrested on the day of the fire. Arvind Kejriwal, chief minister of Delhi, announced a compensation of to the next of kin of each person that died and for the injured. Whereas, Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, also declared a compensation of lakhs rupees for dead and a thousand rupees for the injured.
Fire
The fire occurred at the plot of a luggage bag factory in the Anaj Mandi area of Central Delhi in the early morning of 8 December 2019. At least 100 people were sleeping inside the factory, of whom more than 60 were rescued. According to a report from The Hindu, the fire started in the second floor of the building and quickly spread to the third and fourth floor where the workers had been sleeping. The residents of the first two floors were able to escape, but those on the third and the fourth floors were trapped, since the fire blocked their exit and the windows had iron grilles over them.
One worker made a phone call to his family from the building and stated that they were trapped by the fire and there was no way to escape.
Rescue
The Delhi Fire Service (DFS) received a call for help around 5:22 am IST (UTC+05:30). According to the first responders of the DFS, they had reached the location within five minutes, but their entry to the building was prevented by narrow passageways and the intensity of the fire. A total of thirty five fire engines reached the area and eventually doused the fire.
A firefighter stated that the entry from the terrace was blocked by the locked doors, and that the windows had iron grilles. Gas cutters were employed to remove the grilles. The lane leading to the main entrance was congested and could only allow the entry of one fire engine at a time. A second staircase in the building was blocked with stacks of raw materials for the factory.
An estimated 150 firemen were involved in the rescue operation and rescued 63 people.
A National Disaster Response Force team was deployed to assist the fire department in the rescue work. The NDRF team had searched the factory for any remaining trapped victims and swept the area with gas detectors. According to the NDRF deputy commander, the third and fourth floors were filled with smoke and the levels of hazardous carbon monoxide (CO) were found to be very high.
Victims
43 people died and more than 56 were injured. Two firefighters were also injured in the incident. According to fire and police officials, the injured were shifted to Lady Hardinge Hospital, RML Hospital, LNJP Hospital, and Hindu Rao Hospital.
An LNJP Hospital official stated that thirty-four people were brought dead to the hospital, with smoke inhalation being the primary cause of the death. Some of the bodies were charred. He added that among the fifteen injured, nine were under observation.
According to the police, most of the dead were labourers who were sleeping inside the factory and died due to asphyxiation.
Investigation
The state government ordered an investigation and a report be delivered within seven days. The cause of the fire is still unknown and is being investigated. According to eye witnesses and the preliminary police investigation, an electrical short circuit was the probable cause. A police official added that a large amount of plastic stored in the premises led to smoke after the fire started. The smoke caused asphyxiation and death among the residents.
The luggage bag factory was operating in a residential area. According to the local fire chief, the building lacked a proper fire licence and its use as a factory was illegal. The Delhi Police filed a case against the two owners of the factory and assigned it to the Crime Branch for investigation. The owner of the building and his manager were arrested on the same day under IPC sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter).
The government of Delhi stated that Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) of the Central Government of India had "minted false claims" about the Delhi factory fire to hide the "corruption and inefficiency of the municipal corporation". It also alleged that the MoHUA was defending the illegal factory. The Delhi Fire service had stated that the factory had no fire clearance or permits to operate and was illegal, and that safety equipment was unavailable.
Aftermath
Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted about the incident, calling it "extremely horrific", and announced a compensation of to next of kin of each person that died and for the injured. Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of state, reached on site to make overall assessment, and announced a compensation of to next of kin of each person that died and for the injured. Manoj Tiwari, Bharatiya Janta Party state president, announced a compensation of to the next of kin of each person that died and to those who were injured.
Fireman Rajesh Shukla was praised by the state Home Minister Satyendra Jain for rescuing 11 people. Shukla was an early responder and entered the building to rescue people without waiting for backup to arrive. He suffered bone injuries and was admitted to LNJP Hospital for treatment.

Carlo Emanuele dal Pozzo, The 5th Prince of La Cisterna (7 January 1787 in Turin – 26 March 1864 in Turin) was a nobleman and politician in the Kingdom of Sardinia. His other titles were 5th Principe di Belriguardo, 6th Marchese di Voghera, 6th Conte di Reano, 8th Conte di Ponderano, 8th Conte di Bonvicino, 6th Conte di Neive, 6th Conte di Perno, among others.
Life and marriage
The prince was a liberal, and he conspired in his youth against King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia in favour of a constitutional monarchy. This attempt failed, and he was forced into exile in France, where he continued promoting the Risorgimento. In 1848, he was allowed to return to Italy, and he became a senator of Sardinia.
In Brussels on 28 September 1846, he married Countess Louise de Merode-Westerloo, daughter of Count Werner de Merode (of the princely house of Rubempré) by his wife, Countess Victoire de Spangen d'Uyternesse. The couple had two daughters.
He was made a baron of the French Empire in 1810 and became chamberlain in the same year to Camillo Borghese, Duke of Guastalla.
Issue
Princess Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo (1847–1876), married Prince Amedeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta (second son of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy), who briefly occupied the Spanish throne from 1870 to 1873. After the death of Carlo Emanuele, Maria Vittoria inherited her father's titles, which passed through her to the Aosta cadet branch of the House of Savoy.
Princess Beatrice Giuseppa Antonia Luisa dal Pozzo (1851–1864), died during childhood. Buried at Chapel of Madonna of Pietà, Reano.

Robert Forsyth McDermid (26 September 1895 – 19 August 1952) was a professional footballer who played for Rangers, Dumbarton, Queen of the South and Aberdeen.
Rangers
McDermid began his career at Queen's Park, then joined Rangers where he was a regular member of the side in his first season, 1917–18, finishing as champions. By early 1919 he was no longer in the plans of the Rangers management and was transferred to Dumbarton, then returned to Rangers in 1921 only to be subsequently loaned out to Dumfries club Queen of the South two years later.
Queen of the South
Revitalised by the move, McDermid found inspired form at Queens.
Along with Joe Dodds and Bob McDougall, McDermid was with Queen of the South when they first joined the Scottish Football League in 1923–34 at its lowest level, the newly created Scottish Third Division. Queens finished a creditable third, but their biggest achievement that season was in the Scottish Qualifying Cup. Then considerably more prestigious than now, Queens brought the cup to the South West for the first time in its 25-year history. In the final replay, a surging run through the opposition half and shot from McDermid opened the scoring. Next McDermid's 'dummy' let Bert Lister in to hit the second. McDermid's left foot finish sealed the 3-0 win and Queens were crowned cup winners. The train bringing the players and the trophy back to Dumfries were met by crowds of jubilant well wishers on the platforms and surrounding streets and approaches. The team were then entertained at the Town Hall Buildings on Buccleuch Street.
Aberdeen
Such was McDermid's form at Queens that Aberdeen moved for him in 1925, in what many regarded as the twilight of his career. Aberdonians advocate that it was there McDermid enjoyed the best days of his career – he spent eight years at Pittodrie and became club captain.
After retiring from playing, McDermid became the club trainer.

Patrick James Grossi (born May 28, 1983), better known by his stage name Active Child, is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. His debut album, You Are All I See, was released in 2011 and produced by Ariel Rechtshaid, and garnered substantial reviews from media outlets like Pitchfork Media and Drowned in Sound. In 2011, Active Child opened for British musician James Blake and for the French synthpop band M83. In 2012, his song, "Hanging On," was covered by English pop artist Ellie Goulding and later included on her second album, Halcyon.
Early life
Grossi was born May 28, 1983 in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the son of Bob Grossi, a sales executive for Priority Records and Donna Grossi, an abstract and figurative painter. His father's music had been a childhood influence through the rhythms of '80s alternative dance bands like New Order and at the age of 9 he started singing with the Philadelphia Boys Choir. Grossi, at a very young age, began touring with the Philly Boys Choir in Europe, South Africa and Australia, performing at Carnegie Hall, Sydney Opera House and singing with a choir in South Africa. As a teenager, he listened to a lot of early '90s gangster rap and focused on sports and education. During his college days in Colorado, the local arts landscape influenced him to pick up guitar and harp and rediscover his musical talent. He combined elements learned as a child and during his time with Philly Boys Choir, with his falsetto, live harp, and evocative lyrics and debuted in 2010 as Active Child.
Career
2010: Career beginnings
Grossi's first release was Sun Rooms, a cassette put out on January 14, 2010 by Mirror Universe Tapes. That same year, came a 7" vinyl single, She Was A Vision, which was released in February 2010 via Transparent. The record includes the single She Was A Vision and b-side Voice of an Old Friend. His first official EP, Curtis Lane EP was released in June 2010, The Guardian remarked how the sombre young man creates glacial and gloomy music, and how the songs have a sort of spiritual quality. Pitchfork wrote, Grossi seems to have pushed the cosmic, stately side of these tracks to the forefront.
2011–present
Grossi released his debut LP, You Are All I See in August 2011, featuring tracks such as Hanging On and Johnny Belinda. Drowned in Sound remarked, "You Are All I See is all about the shimmer, Grossi's touch is so deft, and the sound so seemingly in tune with the natural world, he somehow is able to play with light." By 2013, he released albums and EPs for labels including Vagrant, Spunk, Plancha and others. Several of his tracks have appeared on compilations and in multiple films including Divergent and The Host.
In August 2011, Active Child appeared on NPR Music Mondays and in 2012, he appeared on a mixtape, I Like Boys Who Cry with Charli XCX. Later in the year, he appeared in a compilation, The Singles with Lana Del Rey, PRAY with Gilbere Forte and Classixx debut album Hanging Gardens. His second single album, Mercy was released in June 2015 by Vagrant and produced by Van Rivers. Spin magazine described the album as "heartbreaking and luxurious " with Pitchfork remarking that his vocals on the record are "astonishing, like a rising updraft". His track "Painted Staircase" was featured in the official trailer of the Apple TV+ series, Defending Jacob (2020).
Tours
Around 2010, Grossi embarked on his first support tour with White Rabbits playing shows throughout the UK and Europe. In 2011 Grossi announced he would be undertaking another American tour in November with M83. He announced tour dates to support U.K. electronic musician James Blake; in May 2011, the tour included a stop at Chicago's Lincoln Hall and New York's Bowery Ballroom. The Los Angeles Times described his live performance as "one of the most original and ambitious sounds in Los Angeles". In February 2012, he announced a headline spring tour where after jaunting across the UK and Europe in February and March, Grossi landed stateside for a series of shows running from April 27 in Pomona, CA to May 22 in Salt Lake City, UT.

In May 2015, he again toured United States, at Lighting in a Bottle Festival opening at Bradley, CA, the tour was completed in nearly two months at The Cathedral Sanctuary at Immanuel Presbyterian in Los Angeles, CA.

The Refugees on Jeju Island () are less than 552 Yemenis, mostly men, who traveled to South Korea as tourists, then claimed asylum on Jeju Island throughout 2016 to 2018. They are staying on the island under refugee status determination, which led to controversy in South Korea.
Background
The number of refugees fleeing the civil war in Yemen and seeking shelter on Jeju Island through its visa-waiver program rapidly increased in the year 2018. No Yemenis requested refugee status on Jeju in the first year of the war, only seven did so in 2016, and only 42 did so in 2017, but in 2018, the number of applications rose to about 500. As of May 2018, 942 foreigners requested refugee status in Jeju and 515 are Yemenis according to the Jeju Immigration Office. Worries about security increased within the island in response to the spike, with numerous accusations of Yemenis committing crimes adding to the hostile reception of the asylum seekers. Reflecting the negative public sentiment, a petition was posted on the Blue House website requesting the expulsion of the Yemeni refugees.
Jeju's visa-waiver program
Many of the Yemeni refugees fled to Malaysia first, because Malaysia allows a three-month stay visa-free. Of the few countries which do not require visas for Yemenis, Malaysia was favored as the initial destination, mostly due to the cultural similarities deriving from sharing a common Islamic religious tradition. However, Malaysia is not a signatory of the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, and therefore avoids the legal obligation to protect the rights of the displaced. As Malaysia prohibited the Yemenis from staying longer, they moved to Jeju Island through the region's visa-free program. Jeju's visa-waiver program was introduced on May 1, 2002 as a part of Special Act on the Development of Jeju International Cosmopolitan City (Korean: 제주특별자치도 설치 및 국제자유도시 조성을 위한 특별법) for the purpose of encouraging more tourists into the island.
Special Entry arrangements for the Jeju island
Special Entry arrangements in Jeju are provided for nationals of all countries not allowed visa-free entry into Korea. The duration is up to 30 days, and the conditions are limited to only those who arrive directly into Jeju Island by flights or ships. In this case, the permitted area or range for the Special Entry is limited to Jeju Island only. In December 2017, budget airline AirAsia began a direct flight from Malaysia to Jeju, which many point to as a contributing factor for increased asylum seekers.
Action
On June 1, 2018, the Korean Immigration Service excluded Yemen from its list of visa waiver countries and imposed restrictions on Yemeni refugees on Jeju Island that would prevent them from leaving for other parts of South Korea. Jeju Island's government assisted Yemeni refugees with finding employment in sectors facing labor shortages. The Korea Immigration Service provided humanitarian assistance and management of refugee applicants while preventing additional Yemeni immigration. The Jeju Provincial Office said that it would do its best to protect Jeju citizens while providing humanitarian aid to Yemen refugees.
More than 540,000 South Koreans signed a petition to the Blue House asking for changes to the immigration policy of South Korea.
On July 12, 2018, hundreds of South Koreans protested against the presence of Yemeni refugees in Jeju Island.
On August 2, 2018, lawmaker Cho Kyoung-Tae held a conference to discuss the possibility of repealing the refugee law. Cho claimed that no-visa entry policy for any foreigners on Jeju island should be abolished.
Lawmaker Lee Un-ju denounced the refugees on Jeju Island as "fakers seeking jobs and money" and opposes them.
In February 2019, the first Yemeni restaurant on Jeju Island called 'Wardah,' meaning 'flower' in Arabic, was opened by a South Korean and a Yemeni refugee who later got married.

Edward Stanley "Eddie" Slowinski (November 18, 1922 – August 21, 1999) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played 291 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) between 1947 and 1953. Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, he spent most of his career with the New York Rangers.
Career
Slowinski began his junior career with the Winnipeg Monarchs in the playoffs of the 1940-41 season, scoring two goals in three games. He stayed in Winnipeg for one more season before moving on to the Ottawa Army and then Ottawa Commandos. Over the next few years he went from team to team - the Red Deer Rangers, Calgary and Winnipeg Navy, and the Ottawa Senators - before making it to the NHL. The New York Rangers put Slowinski into their lineup for the 1947-48 season and, despite playing a handful of games for their AHL team, he was a New York Ranger for his whole career.
In the 1949-50 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Rangers were up three games to two over the Red Wings when the Wings came back and took the championship in overtime of the seventh game. Slowinski led all scorers in assists that playoff year but never held the Stanley Cup. He played five more seasons of pro hockey in the AHL before retiring after the 1957–58 season.

Politics
Ford County is one of the state's most consistently Republican counties; since its 1859 organization it has voted for Republican presidential candidates in all but two elections. In 1912, the GOP was mortally divided and Progressive Theodore Roosevelt carried the county over the more conservative official nominee William Howard Taft; in 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt in the first of his four campaigns became and has remained the only Democrat to carry Ford County. Since 1968 no Democratic presidential candidate has topped 36% of the county's vote, and since the county first formed only three Democrats – all in landslide national victories – have managed 40% of Ford County's votes.
After the Libertarian Party's success in the 1998 election for Ford County Sheriff and other countywide offices, it achieved established party status. At the time this made Ford County the only county in Illinois with three established parties. Due to its second place showing over the then-dormant Democratic Party in that election, the Libertarians received the minority party's seat on the Board of Review and one of the five seats on the Sheriff's Merit Commission. This status was lost by 2002 after the Libertarian Party failed to field any candidates in the 2002 general election.
President Gerald Ford visited Ford County on October 24, 1974, to mark the retirement of Congressman Leslie C. Arends of Melvin who served in Congress for 40 years, including over 30 years as Republican Minority Whip.

The Mallikarjuna temple is located in the town of Kuruvatti (also spelt Kuruvathi) in the Bellary district of Karnataka state, India. The temple was constructed in the early 12th century rule of the Western Chalukya Empire (also known as the Later or Kalyani Chalukya empire). The temple is protected as a monument of national importance by the Archaeological Survey of India.
Art historian Adam Hardy classifies the architectural style and guild involved in the construction of the temple as a "trans-Tungabhadra branch" of the "mainstream Lakkundi school" of the Later Chalukya style of architecture.
The art historian Ajay Sinha classifies the Kuruvatti style to be a third idiom, the other two being the Lakkundi and Itagi (or Ittagi) schools. He describes the overall achievement at Kuruvatti as "majestic", despite a lack of artistic over indulgence. The building material used is soapstone According to Sinha, a 1099 A.D. inscription at the temple claims it was constructed in service of the god "Abhinava Someshvara" and that the temple also went by the name "Ahavamallesvara". He recants that both names are associated with the deceased Chalukya King Someshvara I who committed voluntary suicide at Kuruvatti in 1062. Sinha feels the temple may have been constructed between 1070 and 1100 in his memory by his heir apparent, the King Vikramaditya VI.
Temple plan
The Mallikarjuna temple has a single shrine with a superstructure or tower (ekakuta vimana) with porched entrances from three sides.
According to the art historian Adam Hardy, the existing tower (shikhara) is a later day re-construction.
But the art historian Henry Cousens feels the superstructure and its Kalasha (decorative structure at the peak of tower) are original, though the tower has been whitewashed in more recent times. The temple consists of a sanctum (garbhagriha), an antechamber (also called vestibule or antarala) which connects the sanctum to a gathering hall (sabhamantapa), two halls (mukhamantapa) on either side, and independent of the main temple complex and to the east, a hall (nandimantapa) containing a sculpture of Nandi (the bull, a companion of the Hindu god Shiva). The outer walls of the shrine and hall (mantapa) have been provided with projections and recesses giving rise to niches, in which, in relief, are pilasters (including a new Chalukyan variety), miniature decorative towers (turrets or aedicule), sculptures of Hindu gods, and women displaying stylized feminine features (salabanjika or madanika). According to Cousens, the presence of miniature decorative towers on the shrine walls is noteworthy because most other Western Chalukya constructions have these reliefs only on the superstructure over the shrine. Cousens feels the specimens of makara (mythical beasts) on the shrine walls are exceptionally delicate with "tails of flowing arabesque" standing out free from the background material. Inside, the entrance to the antechamber has a highly decorated lintel with motifs of aquatic creatures (makara torana).

Kate Cooper (born 1960) is a Professor of History and former head of the History Department at Royal Holloway, University of London, a role to which she was appointed in September 2017 and she stood down in 2019. She was previously Professor of Ancient History and Head of the Department of Classics and Ancient History at the University of Manchester, where she taught from 1995.
Early life and education
Cooper was born in 1960 in Washington, D.C. She gained a BA in English Literature from Wesleyan University in 1982, and an M.T.S. in Scripture and Interpretation from Harvard University in 1986. She was awarded her doctorate for the thesis 'Concord and Martyrdom: Gender, Community, and the Uses of Christian Perfection in Late Antiquity' from the Department of the Study of Religion, Princeton University, in 1992. Her supervisor was Peter Brown. She is known by and publishes under the name Kate Cooper.
Career
Cooper held a Leverhulme Trust Major Research Fellowship (2012–15) for a project on 'The Early Christian Martyr Acts: A New Approach to Ancient Heroes of Resistance'. Her research interests are the cultural, social, and religious history of late Roman society, focusing particularly on the Christianization of Roman elites, and on daily life and the Roman family, religion and gender, social identity, and the fall of the Roman Empire. Other major fellowships and prizes she has held include a Research Councils UK Fellowship to investigate the role of violence in early Christianity during the century before and after the reign of Constantine the Great, asking what was distinctive about the Christian approach to violence, and the role of violence in establishing identities and boundaries between communities (2009–12); and the Rome Prize (1990-1). She was a Summer Fellow at Dumbarton Oaks in 1998. Her project was “The Roman Cult of Eastern Martyrs, 400–700”. She is a regular contributor to print and broadcast media in the US and UK, and blogs about her work.
Critical reception of work
Her work has been described as 'ambitious', 'valuable', and 'noteworthy'. Band of Angels was reviewed in the New Statesman, which said: "Her book is characterised by a scholarly seriousness and the disarmingly unapologetic way she links the personal, the political and the institutional. Avoiding clichés, she excavates the experiences of a wide range of women, letting them speak for themselves. Strikingly, she also refers to her own experiences." The work was described as '‘the best kind of popular history.'
A more mixed view was taken in a review in The Daily Telegraph, which found "Cooper has written a highly readable and important work of the history of religion. She wears her evident scholarship lightly, but the text is suffused with personal, imaginative and emotional perspectives. From the prologue, with its memories of her childhood and her mother, to the epilogue's fictitious portrayal of a virgin mother at the Council of Chalcedon in the fifth century, she abandons the detachment of the professional historian. While this can work well in the realms of human history, it seems to me problematic in the domain of religious history. This fine book, in other words, left me wondering whether Prof Cooper wasn't having her faith claims and eating them."
A The Guardian review said the book was "as much an exercise in historical detective work as anything else, an act of reading between and behind the lines, rescuing these lost women from ancient sources, assessing their influence, and placing their lives in a broader social and historical context."

The 2007 Seville City Council election, also the 2007 Seville municipal election, was held on Sunday, 27 May 2007, to elect the 8th City Council of the municipality of Seville. All 33 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain.
Electoral system
The City Council of Seville () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Seville, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years.
Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over 18 years of age, registered in the municipality of Seville and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national European citizens and those whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of five percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each local council. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale:
The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, the appointee would be determined by lot.
The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Seville, as its population was between 300,001 and 1,000,000, at least 5,000 signatures were required.
Opinion polls
The table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour.

Zahra Rahnavard (; born Zohreh Kazemi; 19 August 1945) is an Iranian academic, artist and politician. Rahnavard is a university professor, artist under house arrest from February 2011 to May 2018. In 2009, Foreign Policy magazine named her one of the world's most distinguished thinkers without any evidence. She is the wife of former Iran Prime Minister Mir Hussein Musavi. In part of her work, she has underlined the need for men to respect the laws of the hijab in the same way as women, as well as a general activist for women's rights in the Middle East.
Early life
Rahnavard was born in Boroojerd, Iran. Her father Haj-Fathali was a Sh'ia and anti-Communist. After hearing of a gathering of Sh'ia clerics in Iran, Haj-Fathali emigrated to Khomein, Markazi Province where Zahra was raised. Zahra Rahnavard earned her bachelor and master's degrees in art and architecture from University of Tehran. She also has master's and PhD degrees from Islamic Azad University in Political science.
Career
Rahnavard was among the early revolutionaries against the Shah. In the last years of the Shah, she was close to Ali Shariati, a dissident Islamist leader.
Rahnavard served as the Chancellor of Alzahra University in Tehran from 1998 to 2006, and as a Political Adviser to the former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Rahnavard was the first Iranian woman appointed as a chancellor of a university since the Iranian Revolution of 1979. She was nominated to this post by former Minister of Science, Research and Technology, Mostafa Moin. After the election of president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005 and the purging of reformist officials from the government, Rahnavard was removed (or resigned) from her position as the Chancellor of Al-zahra University in 2006, replaced by Mahboubeh Mobasheri.
As the head of the Women's Social and Cultural Council, established in 1989, as one of seven government committees exploring various social issues, Rahnavard has called for these committees to be more equally represented by women members and has been an outspoken critic of the government's failure to accord women what, in her opinion, are their legitimate social and civil rights under the Qu'ran.
She was an active member of her husband Mir-Hossein Mousavi's campaign when Mousavi entered the 2009 presidential election. Now she is a member of The Green Path of Hope and is one of the Leaders of Opposition. Rahnavard is also the author of 15 books.
Personal life
Rahnavard is the wife of Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the former Prime Minister of Iran and had three daughters: Kokab, Narges and Zahra. She and Mousavi married on 18 September 1969. They are now on a house confinement.

Amritlal Vegad (3 October 1928 – 6 July 2018) was a noted Gujarati and Hindi language writer and painter living in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India.
Biography
Amritlal was born to Govamal Jivan Vegad, who was a railway contractor hailing from village Kumbhariya in Kutch belonging to a small but enterprising Mestri community of Kutch. Govamal Jivan settled in Jabalpur, while working as railway contractor for Bengal Nagpur Railway laying railway lines in Gondia – Jabalpur section in year 1906 with fellow Mistri contractors.
Education
Amritlal Vegad did his studies from Visva Bharati University at Shantiniketan and was trained under able teachers like Nandalal Bose, during the years 1948 to 1953, from whom he learned to appreciate nature & its beauty. He was trained in water colours but he painted also in oil colours. After coming back to Jabalpur, he joined as teacher at Institute of Fine Arts in Jabalpur. His story written as a students project, while studying at Shantinikaten – Introducing Ahimsa to the Battlefield has been a part of famous book – Gandhi-Ganga published in 1968.
He died on 6 July 2018.
Work
Amritlal Vegad was awarded in 2004 the Sahitya Akademi Award for his travelogue – Saundaryani Nadi Narmada and also Madhya Pradesh Rajya Sahitya Award & Rashtrapati Award for his various works. He is also a recipient of the Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan award in Hindi.
The name of his most noted book is Narmada-ki-pari-krama written in Hindi language and Saundaryani Nadi Narmada (travelogue) & Parikramā Narmadā maiyānī in Gujarati language for which he has earned several awards. Further, he has also written folk tales & essays in Gujarati, like the book named Thodun sonun, thodun rupun. Other books are "Amritasya Narmada" and "Teere Teere Narmada". These books have been translated into Gujarati (by himself), English, Bengali and Marathi.
He has written these books from his personal foot travel along the banks of Narmada, which he has been doing now for more than three decades, starting from its origin point at Amarkantak to its final discharge at sea near Bharuch. His first book was Narmada – River of Beauty. He started his first foot-travel along the route of river Narmada known as parikrama in 1977 at age of 49 and did his last parikrama of river in 1999 at the age of 71. He was accompanied in all his travel by his wife, who would carry her load herself.
His books are adorned with sketches and collages made by him personally, during the travel, which have been widely appreciated as works of art by critics at exhibitions.
Amritlal Vegad was also noted for his works as an environmental activist, raising the issues of pollution of rivers like Narmada and others in State of Madhya Pradesh. He was the President of Narmada Samagra, an institution working against pollution of rivers and improving the facilities of public toilet and baths, along bathing ghats of rivers, in an effort to improve sanitation and reduce pollution of river banks and river waters.

In statistical decision theory, a randomised decision rule or mixed decision rule is a decision rule that associates probabilities with deterministic decision rules. In finite decision problems, randomised decision rules define a risk set which is the convex hull of the risk points of the nonrandomised decision rules.
As nonrandomised alternatives always exist to randomised Bayes rules, randomisation is not needed in Bayesian statistics, although frequentist statistical theory sometimes requires the use of randomised rules to satisfy optimality conditions such as minimax, most notably when deriving confidence intervals and hypothesis tests about discrete probability distributions.
A statistical test making use of a randomized decision rule is called a randomized test.
Definition and interpretation
Let be a set of non-randomised decision rules with associated probabilities . Then the randomised decision rule is defined as and its associated risk function is . This rule can be treated as a random experiment in which the decision rules are selected with probabilities respectively.
Alternatively, a randomised decision rule may assign probabilities directly on elements of the actions space for each member of the sample space. More formally, denotes the probability that an action is chosen. Under this approach, its loss function is also defined directly as: .
The introduction of randomised decision rules thus creates a larger decision space from which the statistician may choose his decision. As non-randomised decision rules are a special case of randomised decision rules where one decision or action has probability 1, the original decision space is a proper subset of the new decision space .
Selection of randomised decision rules
As with nonrandomised decision rules, randomised decision rules may satisfy favourable properties such as admissibility, minimaxity and Bayes. This shall be illustrated in the case of a finite decision problem, i.e. a problem where the parameter space is a finite set of, say, elements.
The risk set, henceforth denoted as , is the set of all vectors in which each entry is the value of the risk function associated with a randomised decision rule under a certain parameter: it contains all vectors of the form . Note that by the definition of the randomised decision rule, the risk set is the convex hull of the risks .
In the case where the parameter space has only two elements and , this constitutes a subset of , so it may be drawn with respect to the coordinate axes and corresponding to the risks under and respectively. An example is shown on the right.
Admissibility
An admissible decision rule is one that is not dominated by any other decision rule, i.e. there is no decision rule that has equal risk as or lower risk than it for all parameters and strictly lower risk than it for some parameter. In a finite decision problem, the risk point of an admissible decision rule has either lower x-coordinates or y-coordinates than all other risk points or, more formally, it is the set of rules with risk points of the form such that . Thus the left side of the lower boundary of the risk set is the set of admissible decision rules.
Minimax
A minimax Bayes rule is one that minimises the supremum risk among all decision rules in . Sometimes, a randomised decision rule may perform better than all other nonrandomised decision rules in this regard.
In a finite decision problem with two possible parameters, the minimax rule can be found by considering the family of squares . The value of for the smallest of such squares that touches is the minimax risk and the corresponding point or points on the risk set is the minimax rule.
If the risk set intersects the line , then the admissible decision rule lying on the line is minimax. If or holds for every point in the risk set, then the minimax rule can either be an extreme point (i.e. a nonrandomised decision rule) or a line connecting two extreme points (nonrandomised decision rules).
Bayes
A randomised Bayes rule is one that has infimum Bayes risk among all decision rules. In the special case where the parameter space has two elements, the line , where and denote the prior probabilities of and respectively, is a family of points with Bayes risk . The minimum Bayes risk for the decision problem is therefore the smallest such that the line touches the risk set. This line may either touch only one extreme point of the risk set, i.e. correspond to a nonrandomised decision rule, or overlap with an entire side of the risk set, i.e. correspond to two nonrandomised decision rules and randomised decision rules combining the two. This is illustrated by the three situations below:
As different priors result in different slopes, the set of all rules that are Bayes with respect to some priors are the same as the set of admissible rules.
Note that no situation is possible where a nonrandomised Bayes rule does not exist but a randomised Bayes rule does. The existence of a randomised Bayes rule implies the existence of a nonrandomised Bayes rule. This is also true in the general case, even with infinite parameter space, infinite Bayes risk, and regardless of whether the infimum Bayes risk can be attained. This supports the intuitive notion that the statistician need not utilise randomisation to arrive at statistical decisions.
In practice
As randomised Bayes rules always have nonrandomised alternatives, they are unnecessary in Bayesian statistics. However, in frequentist statistics, randomised rules are theoretically necessary under certain situations, and were thought to be useful in practice when they were first invented: Egon Pearson forecast that
they 'will not meet with strong objection'. However, few statisticians actually implement them nowadays.
Randomised test
Randomized tests should not be confused with permutation tests.
In the usual formulation of the likelihood ratio test, the null hypothesis is rejected whenever the likelihood ratio is smaller than some constant , and accepted otherwise. However, this is sometimes problematic when is discrete under the null hypothesis, when is possible.
A solution is to define a test function , whose value is the probability at which the null hypothesis is accepted:
This can be interpreted as flipping a biased coin with a probability of returning heads whenever and rejecting the null hypothesis if a head turns up.
A generalised form of the Neyman–Pearson lemma states that this test has maximum power among all tests at the same significance level , that such a test must exist for any significance level , and that the test is unique under normal situations.
As an example, consider the case where the underlying distribution is Bernoulli with probability , and we would like to test the null hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis . It is natural to choose some such that , and reject the null whenever , where is the test statistic. However, to take into account cases where , we define the test function:
where is chosen such that .
Randomised confidence intervals
An analogous problem arises in the construction of confidence intervals. For instance, the Clopper-Pearson interval is always conservative because of the discrete nature of the binomial distribution. An alternative is to find the upper and lower confidence limits and by solving the following equations:
where is a uniform random variable on (0, 1).

Aglossa caprealis, the stored grain moth, is a moth species of the family Pyralidae. It is found globally, though its native range is presumably the western Palearctic or nearby regions, as in other Aglossa species.
The wingspan is 23–27 mm. The moth flies from June to August, depending on the location.
The larvae feed on dry plant waste, grain (e.g. maize), hay, straw and decaying manure. Sometimes, they even eat animal carcasses, suet, lard, pork rinds and other fatty materials.

Michael Steward Heath (born April 9, 1964) is an American former competition swimmer who specialized in freestyle events. He is a three-time Olympic gold medalist, and a former world record-holder in two relay swimming events. A native of Texas, he won two national collegiate championship competing for the University of Florida. During his elite swimming career, Heath won ten medals in major international championships, including seven golds, two silvers and a bronze, spanning the Olympic Games, FINA World Championships, and Pan Pacific Championships.
Early years
Heath was born in McAllen, Texas. He attended Highland Park High School in University Park, Texas (a Dallas suburb), and competed for the Highland Park High School swim team. In 1980, he set a new Texas state high school record in the boys' 200-yard freestyle (1:37.88); he set a second state record in the event in 1982 (1:37.53), breaking his own previous record in the process.
College swimming career
Heath accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he swam for coach Randy Reese's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition from 1983 to 1986. He was a member of the Gators' 1983 and 1984 NCAA men's championship teams, as well as four consecutive SEC championships teams. As a Gator swimmer, he won NCAA national titles in the 400-yard freestyle relay (1983), 800-yard freestyle relay (1983, 1984), and 200-yard freestyle (1984), and received nineteen All-American honors. His strong finish swimming the anchor leg for the Gators in the 4×100-yard freestyle relay provided the Gators' winning points in their first NCAA national team championship in 1983. He also won seven SEC titles, and was recognized as the SEC male swimmer of the year in 1983 and 1985. Heath graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in exercise and sports science in 1988, and was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a "Gator Great" in 1996.
International swimming career
Heath, who had not previously been a member of the U.S. national team, won the 100- and 200-meter freestyle events at the 1984 U.S. Olympic trials, and thereby qualified to compete in the two Olympic individual events and for the U.S. relay teams. As a newcomer to the U.S. trials, he made a dramatic statement by setting a new American record in the preliminary heats of the 200-meter freestyle. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he won three gold medals and a silver.
He won his first Olympic gold medal by swimming the lead-off leg in the men's 4×200-meter freestyle relay, and Heath and his American teammates David Larson, Jeff Float and Bruce Hayes set a new world record of 7:15.69, edging the Michael Gross-led West Germans by four one-hundredths (0.04) of a second. He won his second gold medal by helping set another world record of 3:19.03 in the men's 4×100-meter freestyle relay, together with fellow Americans Chris Cavanaugh, Matt Biondi and Rowdy Gaines, finishing sixty-five one-hundredths (0.65) of a second ahead of the second-place Australians. He then earned a third gold medal by swimming for the winning U.S. team in the preliminary heats of the 4×100-meter medley relay. In a word play on the title of the popular 1984 movie Ghostbusters, American media dubbed Heath and his 4×200-meter relay teammates the "Gross Busters."
In individual Olympic competition, Heath won a silver medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.10) behind Gross's world record-setting performance (1:47.44). He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final (50.41); the outcome was controversial, however, because of a premature starter gun and a quick start by Gaines, the winner. Gaines' coach, Richard Quick, knew of starter Frank Silvestri's propensity to fire the starter gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks. Gaines gained about a meter's head start on the competition; video of the event later confirmed that one or more of the swimmers had not been set when the starter gun fired.
After the 1984 Olympics, Heath continued to swim for the U.S. national team, and remained a fixture on the freestyle relay teams. At the 1985 Pan Pacific Championships in Tokyo, gold medalists Scott McCadam, Heath, Paul Wallace and Biondi set a new world record of 3:17.08 in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. Together with Biondi, Duffy Dillon and Craig Oppel, he won another gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay (7:17.63). Individually, Heath won a Pan Pacific Championships gold medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.29) by beating Biondi (1:50.19) and Canadian Sandy Goss (1:50.56). He also won a Pan Pacific silver medal in the 100-meter freestyle (50.78), finishing a fraction of a second behind Biondi (50.44). Heath again swam for the U.S. relay teams at the 1986 World Aquatics Championships in Madrid; Tom Jager, Heath, Paul Wallace and Biondi won the 4×100-meter freestyle (3:19.89); and Eric Boyer, Heath, Dan Jorgensen and Biondi placed third in the 4×200-meter freestyle (7:18.29).
Life after competition swimming
Heath was an assistant coach for the Florida Gators swim team from 1988 to 1989. After graduating from the University of Florida, Heath first worked as a salesman, before he coached swimming at Fletcher High School in Neptune Beach, Florida, for six years, and thereafter at Episcopal High School in Jacksonville, Florida. He is married to Sherri-Lee Schricker, who was a member of the Florida Gators swim team at the University of Florida from 1984 to 1987, and they have two children. Their son Grady will swim for the Florida Gators beginning in 2015–16.

Waddington is a small village, 2 miles (3 km) north-west of Clitheroe in the Ribble Valley, Lancashire, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 1,028. Before the 1974 county boundary changes, Waddington fell just within the Bowland Rural District of the West Riding of Yorkshire. It covers approximately 2000 acres of the Forest of Bowland.
It is home to both an Anglican church and a Methodist church, a social club (Waddington Club) with bowling green, a cafe, a post office, a playing field on which both cricket and football are played. Also, within the village there are three popular pubs, the Lower Buck Inn, the Higher Buck and the Waddington Arms. The village is a regular winner of the Lancashire Best Kept Village awards.
History
Waddington was a mesne manor of the ancient Lordship of Bowland which comprised a Royal Forest and a Liberty of ten manors. These spanned eight townships and four parishes, covering an area of almost on the historic borders of Lancashire and Yorkshire. The manors within the Liberty were Slaidburn (Newton-in-Bowland, West Bradford, Grindleton), Knowlmere, Waddington, Easington, Bashall Eaves, Mitton, Withgill (Crook), Leagram, Hammerton and Dunnow (Battersby).
The Tempests were lords of the manor of Waddington from at least the early thirteenth century. The family is credited with endowing the parish church at Waddington. One of their number, Sir Nicholas Tempest, a Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland, was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn in 1537 for his part in the Pilgrimage of Grace.
Following his defeat in the Battle of Hexham during the Wars of the Roses on 15 May 1464, King Henry VI was sheltered by Lancastrian supporters at houses across the north of England. Following stays at Muncaster Castle on the Cumbrian coast and at nearby Bolton Hall, he went into hiding at Waddington Hall, the home of Sir Richard Tempest. He was betrayed by "a black monk of Addington" and on 13 July 1465, a group of Yorkist men, including Sir Richard's brother John, entered the home to arrest him. Henry fled into nearby woods but was soon captured.
Governance
Along with West Bradford, Grindleton and Sawley, the parish forms the Waddington and West Bradford ward of Ribble Valley Borough Council.
The ward had a population of 2,636 in 2001, rising to 2,933 in 2011. The ward elects two councillors, who currently are Paul Elms and Bridget Hilton, both of the Conservative Party.

Francesco Carrozzini (born September 9, 1982) is an Italian-born director and photographer based in the United States. He is known for his portrait photography and has directed music video for artists including Jay-Z, Lana Del Rey, Beyoncé and Lenny Kravitz. He has also directed commercials for brands including Apple and Fiat. In 2016, he made his feature directorial debut at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival with the documentary Franca: Chaos and Creation. In 2022, his first narrative feature, The Hanging Sun, closed the 79th Venice International Film Festival.
Early life
Carrozzini was born in Monza, Italy. The son of Franca Sozzani, former editor-in-chief of Italian Vogue, he grew up in Milan. He began taking pictures and making short films with friends in his early teens. In the summer of 1999, he relocated to Los Angeles to study film at the University of California, Los Angeles. He later returned to Italy to study philosophy at the University of Milan before moving to New York City in 2004 to assist photographers such as Bruce Weber and Peter Lindbergh.
Career
Film
Carrozzini's first film job came at age 19, when he directed a 30-second promo for MTV. In 2005, commissioned by advertising agency McCann Erickson, he created a commercial for the 51st Venice Biennale. He traveled to Poland the following year to shoot a documentary about the life and creative process of the Polish Theatre Wierszalin. Later that year, he collaborated with The New York Times on the creation of a project that became known as "The New York Times Screen Tests," a collection of intimate video interviews with entertainment figures that included Natalie Portman, Charlize Theron, and Marion Cotillard. The series received a nomination in the "New Approaches - Daytime Entertainment" category at the 37th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards.
In 2008, Carrozzini directed the short film "1937", a psychological thriller shot in Suite #822 of the infamous Chelsea Hotel, which screened in competition at the Venice Film Festival.
In the years since, he has directed commercials for clients such as Apple Music, Fiat 500 and Tommy Hilfiger. In 2009, his Ray Ban promo "Color Goes Pop" received a Young Director Award nomination at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity.
In 2013, he began directing music videos and has collaborated with musicians Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Marilyn manson and Lenny Kravitz, amongst others.
In 2016, Carrozzini debuted his first feature-length film, a documentary focusing on the life and legacy of his mother entitled Franca: Chaos and Creation. The film, which took Carrozzini roughly six years to complete, highlights the groundbreaking accomplishments of Sozzani's career in fashion publishing while also exploring the more personal relationship between a mother and her son. Franca: Chaos and Creation premiered on September 2, 2016, in the "Cinema Nel Giardino" category at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival. The film had its North American premiere as part of the Hamptons International Film Festival on October 8, 2016 and was featured at AFI Fest in Los Angeles. In March 2017, the film was honored with a Nastro d'Argento presented by the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists.
The film was released worldwide through Netflix on October 1, 2017.

Other ventures
Franca Fund
In 2019 Francesco, joined by Harvard geneticist Robert C. Green and investor D. A. Wallach, launched the "Franca Sozzani Fund for Preventive Genomics" at Harvard Medical to bring preventive genomics to patients everywhere.
Franca Sozzani, Francesco's mother, made a remarkable impact on global culture during her 28 years as the legendary editor-in-chief of Vogue Italia. And outside of fashion, she was a relentless champion of justice and human progress: a global ambassador against hunger for the United Nations World Food Programme, a supporter of AIDS research, and a chair of the European Institute of Oncology. Franca recognized that fashion and creativity held a unique power to deliver social messages, and in groundbreaking issues of Vogue Italia used beautiful images to explore difficult topics from oil spills to domestic violence.
Tragically, Franca succumbed to a rare cancer in 2016 that might have been prevented with earlier medical surveillance. Such is the case for thousands of patients around the world today who lack access to the proven risk-assessment and diagnostic toolkit that preventive genomics offer.
Extraordinary discoveries in genomics from the past two decades have not yet made it to average patients, remaining largely trapped in a research context in elite academic institutions. Routine medicine today extends to patients a mere sliver of the potential benefits of genetic sequencing, failing to recognize the demonstrated value of full-spectrum sequencing of over 5,000 genes that can predict disease, reproductive, and pharmacological risk in every patient. Misconceptions within the medical community, misrepresentations in the commercial sector, and confusion within governments have all delayed the implementation of these proven technologies and clinical care protocols.
Personal life
Carrozzini dated singer Lana Del Rey from 2014 until 2015. In 2018, Carrozzini married Bee Shaffer, the daughter of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and child psychiatrist David Shaffer. In October 2021, they welcomed a son named Oliver Sozzani.

Gundeldingen Castle is a castle in the Gundeldingen neighborhood of the municipality of Basel of the Canton of Basel-Stadt in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. Originally four related castles, today parts of only two remain.
History
Inner castle
The Front or Inner Castle () was built during the 16th century as a manor house for a wealthy merchant. Over the following centuries it was owned by a number of wealthy families. The manor was the center of a large country estate and for over two centuries was surrounded by a large garden and duck pond. The main building was first painted red about 250 years ago, beginning a tradition that lasts until today. Only the main building remains at Dittingerstrasse 20.
Lower middle castle
Further down Gundeldinger street is the Lower Middle Castle (). This castle was built around 1400 and was originally surrounded by a pond. In 1344 it was recorded as having been owned by Konrad Matzerer, a deceased lay brother of the nearby Saint Alban Monastery. In 1401, Agnes von Dornach combined the Lower and Upper Middle Castles into a single estate. However, after her death in 1415 the Lower Castle was inherited by the Schermann family of Basel. The castle changed hands several times before it was acquired by Thomas Platter in 1549. Platter was the first rector of the Basel Gymnasium. Platter renovated and repaired the dilapidated building until his death in 1582. An exterior stair tower was added in 1674. After over a century of changing ownership, in 1704 Hans Jakob Merian acquired both middle castles. After passing through several other owners, in 1842 the Lower Middle Castle was sold by the heirs of Samuel Hartmann to the city hospital. It was used by the hospital until 1958 when the dilapidated building was sold to the city. Plans to demolish it were cancelled when in 1965 a committee was established to repair and maintain the building. Following a total renovation, the main building reopened in 1974. Since that time, the building has housed government and private offices.
Upper middle castle
The Upper Middle Castle was the oldest of the four castles. It was built in the mid-14th century and was first mentioned in 1377 as a fief granted by Saint Alban Monastery to the knightly von Ramstein family. The castle was surrounded by battlements and a moat until about the 16th century. It was owned by the monastery until 1470, though it was held by a number of local nobles. After 1470 it passed through a number of owners until it was acquired by the Platter family. In the 19th century it was demolished to make way for a brewery.
Outer castle
The Large or Outer Castle () was built at the end of the 14th century. In 1508 it was acquired by the wealthy Jacob Meyer, who paid 350 Rhenish guilder for it. In 1529 he sold the castle and its extensive lands to Jörg Supersaxo of Valais. But Jörg died before he could move into the castle. After passing through other owners, in 1610 Theobald Ryff bought it as a summer residence. Theobald's son sold it in 1660 to the lawyer Felix Platter. Platter first reported that there was a chalybeate or iron bearing mineral spring on the estate lands. In 1704 the mineral spring was recommended by the physician Theodor Zwinger (1658-1724). While a planned mineral spa was never built, the springs were used and piped into Basel until about 1800. After the extinction of the Platter line in the early 18th century, the castle passed through a number of owners. From 1917 until 1953 it was a shelter and girls' home for the Salvation Army. After 1953 it was demolished to make way for an apartment block at Gundeldingerstrasse 446.

Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), or single-strand chain polymorphism, is defined as a conformational difference of single-stranded nucleotide sequences of identical length as induced by differences in the sequences under certain experimental conditions. This property allows sequences to be distinguished by means of gel electrophoresis, which separates fragments according to their different conformations.
Physical background
A single nucleotide change in a particular sequence, as seen in a double-stranded DNA, cannot be distinguished by gel electrophoresis techniques, which can be attributed to the fact that; the physical properties of the double strands are almost identical for both alleles. After denaturation, single-stranded DNA undergoes a characteristic 3-dimensional folding and may assume a unique conformational state based on its DNA sequence. The difference in shape between two single-stranded DNA strands with different sequences can cause them to migrate differently through an electrophoresis gel, even though the number of nucleotides is the same, which is, in fact, an application of SSCP.
Applications in molecular biology
SSCP used to be a way to discover new DNA polymorphisms apart from DNA sequencing but is now being supplanted by sequencing techniques on account of efficiency and accuracy. These days, SSCP is most applicable as a diagnostic tool in molecular biology. It can be used in genotyping to detect homozygous individuals of different allelic states, as well as heterozygous individuals that should each demonstrate distinct patterns in an electrophoresis experiment. SSCP is also widely used in virology to detect variations in different strains of a virus, the idea being that a particular virus particle present in both strains will have undergone changes due to mutation, and that these changes will cause the two particles to assume different conformations and, thus, be differentiable on an SSCP gel.

The Brugse Vrije was a castellany in the county of Flanders, often called in English "the Franc of Bruges". It included the area around Bruges, and was bordered by the North Sea, the Westerschelde and the Yser river. The city of Bruges was separated from the castellany in 1127. Since then the city and the Vrije were considered as separate customary law areas. The Brugse Vrije was a rich agricultural region. It had its own burgrave, who was seated at the Burg, a square in Bruges, and became part of the Four Members of Flanders at the end of the 14th century, together with the three major cities of Ghent, Bruges and Ypres. The Brugse Vrije sat in the meetings of the States of Flanders.
Organisation
The castellany of Bruges was founded at around the year 1000 under the rule of Count Baldwin IV of Flanders (980–1035) as part of the county of Flanders. The head of the castellany was a burgrave, who represented the Count of Flanders. The burgrave was replaced by a bailiff in the 12th century. The fief was first called the Castellany of Bruges, but later took on the name Brugse Vrije. In Middle Ages it was divided into Amts.
The Manor
The governing body of the Brugse Vrije was located at the Burg, the square in Bruges where both the civil and eclessiastical administration were located. Initially the Vrije was seated next to the Steen (castle of the count), on the west side of the Burg. In the 15th century, the Vrije moved to the other side, where it took over a portion of the count's former court, the Dukes of Burgundy having moved their residence to the newly built . In 1434–1440 the Vrije added a tribunal to the southern side, facing towards , a canal in Bruges. In 1520–1525, the complex was extended along the row with a new high tribunal, the aldermen's chamber and an entrance-hall. The architect was Jan van de Poele. A gallery with high arches was built on the Burg-side in 1528–1532. In 1606–1607, a chapel was added next to the aldermen's chamber and in 1664–1666 an orphan room, in which records of the castellany's orphans were kept. The still existing façades on the Groenerei side was built at this time. Lastly, the part of the manor that is visible on the Burg, and which was significantly enlarged by the purchase of the Love in 1555, was rebuilt in 1722–1727 in the Neoclassical style after a design by Jan Verkruys.
The now classified as heritage (1938) building still exists in this form and was used from 1795 to 1984 as a courthouse. Now the building on the Burg houses the city archives, with the reading room located in the chapel. Next to the old Court of Justice lies the renaissance hall. Located in this former aldermen's chamber of the old Palace of the Brugse Vrije, is the monumental 16th-century Emperor-Charles-fireplace, made of oak wood, alabaster and marble, designed by Lanceloot Blondeel.

Three Arrows Capital (also known as 3AC or TAC) was a Singapore-based cryptocurrency hedge fund which was ordered to liquidate on 27 June 2022 by a court in the British Virgin Islands. It was founded in 2012 by Kyle Davies and Su Zhu. The company borrowed billions of dollars to fund its trading, and according to July 2022 bankruptcy filings, faces $3.5 billion in creditors' claims. The fund appears to have lost in excess of $3 billion over 2021 and 2022, making its collapse one of the largest hedge-fund trading losses of all time.
History
Kyle Davies and Su Zhu first met at Phillips Academy and both studied at Columbia University before working for Credit Suisse for brief spells, prior to setting up Three Arrows in 2012. In its early years, the company was focused on arbitraging emerging-market foreign-exchange derivatives and engaged in the habit of finding mispriced derivatives on electronic platforms and keeping them even if banks asked to cancel or amend the trades. This strategy, however, resulted in the fund only earning fractions of a cent for each dollar that was traded. This practice continued until banks started to cut off the fund from that market in 2017, which began the company's shift to cryptocurrencies.
In the fund's last public statement, the fund claimed a net asset value of $18 billion. Blockchain analytics firm Nansen estimated in March 2022 that Three Arrows managed about $10 billion in cryptocurrency assets, although there is speculation that most of their visible assets were sourced by uncollateralized borrowing from various lending platforms.
The firm's founders amassed a large following on Twitter with cryptocurrency related topics. Su Zhu had more than 500,000 followers shortly before the fund failed. The firm backed projects including Aave, Avalanche, Luna, Worldcoin, BlockFi, Deribit, Ethereum, Polkadot, Solana, and WOO Network. According to a January 2021 SEC filing, Three Arrows owned almost 39 million units of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) at the end of 2020. The firm invested approximately $200 million in LUNA tokens in February 2022.
In April 2022 Bloomberg reported that Three Arrows was planning to move its headquarters to Dubai from Singapore, although on June 24th, 2022, Dubai's regulator confirmed that Three Arrows was not registered with the Dubai Financial Services Authority.
Cryptocurrencies experienced broad declines in the first half of 2022, with most tokens losing more than 50% of their market valuation. LUNA, in which Three Arrows had invested and Su Zhu actively promoted on Twitter, collapsed to near zero in May 2022. The spread between Grayscale GBTC trust unit prices and spot Bitcoin prices widened throughout 2021 and 2022, with the trust units trading at a 34% discount to the trust NAV on 17 June 2022.
Licensing and regulatory issues
A class action, Patterson v. TerraForm Labs Pte Ltd. et al, was filed against Three Arrows and others in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on 17 June 2022.
On 30 June 2022, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said it had reprimanded Three Arrows for breaching its allowed threshold of having no more than $250 million Singapore dollars in assets under management, a condition of its August 2013 fund management company registration. Three Arrows was further reprimanded for providing false or misleading information to MAS, and failing to notify MAS of changes to directorships or shareholdings.
Liquidation
On 16 June 2022, the Financial Times reported that Three Arrows had failed to meet its margin calls. On 22 June, The Wall Street Journal reported that Three Arrows had failed to repay money lent from cryptocurrency broker Voyager Digital. On 27 June 2022, Voyager Digital issued a notice of default against Three Arrows for failing to make the required payments on a Bitcoin and USD Coin loan worth more than $665 million. On the same day, a court in the British Virgin Islands ordered the liquidation of Three Arrows Capital, overseen by Teneo. The Joint Liquidators are Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer, both Senior Managing Directors of Teneo. The fund filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy to protect its US assets from creditors.
Voyager Digital declared bankruptcy in July 2022. The firm's CEO, Stephen Ehrlich, attributed the decision in part due to Three Arrows' inability to pay back its loan from Voyager.
Genesis Trading's CEO Michael Moro announced on Twitter that Genesis Trading had incurred substantial losses from loans to Three Arrows and that its parent firm Digital Currency Group has assumed certain liabilities of Genesis related to Three Arrows to ensure adequate operating capital.
The collapse of the company is believed to be partially responsible for the bankruptcy and collapse of the crypto lender Voyager digital and layoffs at Blockchain.com. FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried blamed the company for causing a ripple effect that caused bankruptcy of other crypto firms or lead those firms to freeze assets during the 2022 cryptocurrency crash.
According to court liquidation papers, Davies and Zhu have not been cooperating in the liquidation process of Three Arrows Capital, and their whereabouts was unknown as of 8 July 2022. Three Arrows Capital owes 27 creditors a total of $3.5 billion USD.
In an interview with Bloomberg held at an "undisclosed location" in July 2022 Zhu and Davies remarked that they plan to move to the United Arab Emirates, a country that does not have extradition agreements with both Singapore and the United States.

Easy Money () is a Swedish crime thriller film directed by Daniel Espinosa that was released on 15 January 2010. It is based on the 2006 novel of the same name by Jens Lapidus. Joel Kinnaman stars in the lead role of Johan "JW" Westlund, a rather poor man living a double life in the upper class areas of Stockholm. After meeting a wealthy girl, he is enticed into the world of organized crime and begins to sell cocaine to afford his expensive lifestyle. Easy Money was well received by critics and was a hit at the box office.
Two sequels to the film have been made: Easy Money II (2012) and Easy Money III (2013). In 2010, Warner Bros. announced their plans for an American remake of Easy Money starring Zac Efron, but the project was shelved. In 2021, the TV series Snabba Cash was released on Netflix, containing 6 episodes based on the original novel.
Plot
Johan "JW" Westlund is a man living in Stockholm and is a promising student at the Stockholm School of Economics. JW is originally from the Norrland region in Sweden where his father, who has a slight drinking problem, works in a saw mill, while his mother works in an employment agency. JW is wracked by the disappearance of his sister, Camilla, four years earlier. JW feigns the appearance of a "Stekare" (in Swedish parlance, a lifestyle based on flaunting one's apparent wealth), actually leading a double life driving taxi illegally to finance his expensive life on Stureplan. A romance with the upper-class girl Sophie leads to him being enticed into the world of organized crime. Abdulkarim, who is running the taxi business, offers JW a job in helping him start his cocaine business.
Jorge Salinas Barrio is a Chilean man who went to prison after being caught in the drug business. He has now escaped and is on the run from the police. Jorge knows everything about cocaine. He has a plan: to avenge those who wronged him, among them Serbian Mafia boss Radovan Kranjic, and to make one final cocaine delivery and then leave the country for good.
Mrado Slovovic, a hitman who runs errands for the Serbian Mafia, is sent by Radovan on a mission to take care of Jorge. At the same time, he has to struggle with taking care of his eight-year-old daughter, who he is forced to take with him on his job because the mother has a drug addiction.
These three characters cross paths through their dreams about quick earnings. Once JW and Abdulkarim begin their cocaine business, they want to expand. Abdulkarim has heard that Jorge, who has escaped from prison by this time, has learned everything about the cocaine business while in prison. Simultaneously, Jorge has tried to blackmail Radovan, the Serbian Mafia boss. Mrado is tasked by Radovan to kill Jorge to prevent him from helping any of Radovan's competitors. Meanwhile, JW is promised 20,000 SEK if he can bring Jorge back to Abdulkarim alive. After noticing Mrado following Jorge, JW tails both of them, losing sight of Jorge when he gets on a bus. JW fortuitously finds them when he notices the car he saw Mrado drive away in standing in a forest clearing. When he enters the forest, he finds Mrado and one of Radovan's henchmen savagely beating Jorge. JW sets off the car alarm of the Serbian attackers to distract them. Meanwhile, Jorge hides from his attackers, who then travel further into the forest to find him. JW approaches a badly wounded Jorge and takes him back to his dormitory. Abdulkarim visits JW and Jorge and helps Jorge recuperate. Though hesitant about keeping Jorge in his dorm room, JW relents when Abdulkarim offers him 1000 SEK for every day Jorge stays. As Jorge recuperates, he learns more about JW and the two become friends.
At one of the jetsetter parties, JW falls for Sophie (Lisa Henni), the on and off girlfriend of jet-setter Carl. JW learns that Carl's father's investment bank is in serious financial trouble and Carl may not be able to afford the extravagant "Stekare" lifestyle. This becomes important when Abdulkarim asks JW to figure out how they can launder the 20,000,000 SEK profit they will eventually earn. JW proposes that they buy shares of Carl's father's failing bank, giving it a stimulus that would not only save the business but immediately increase the price of the shares, making it more profitable. JW acts as the frontman for Abdulkarim's cocaine syndicate as they attempt to purchase the bank. Though Carl's father has reservations, he eventually relents and accepts the deal.
Soon after, JW and the drug syndicate visit Jorge's drug dealer friends in Germany. The drug dealers show how they smuggle drugs by inserting drug capsules under the skin of dogs and then letting the incision heal and the hair grow back which takes two months according to the drug dealers. The drug dealers also place drug capsules in the leaves of young cabbage plants and then let the cabbage grow a full size head around the capsule. Abdulkarim's syndicate ultimately negotiates for a shipment of 40 kilos of pure cocaine. The drug dealers want the money deposited in a Swiss account. JW immediately raises concerns about that plan, arguing that Switzerland is not that secret anymore and recommends an account in Andorra or Liechtenstein instead. This gains the drug dealer's trust and allows the transaction to run smoothly. Later, Jorge advises that JW that he is unlikely to see the money promised by Abdulkarim. JW visits Abdulkarim in his hideout and, while talking with Abdulkarim, realizes that what Jorge said was true.
Mrado is waiting with his daughter at JW's apartment building and offers JW two million for assistance in raiding Abdulkarim's drug shipment. JW agrees on the understanding that no one will get hurt. The drugs arrive in an eighteen-wheeler full of cabbages. Jorge and Abdulkarim's men start repackaging the drugs in a warehouse. Meanwhile, JW assists Mrado and one of Mrado's Serbian friends in entering the warehouse. A firefight occurs and one of Abdulkarim's men is seriously wounded immediately. JW is shocked by the turn of events. Jorge realizes that JW has double-crossed them. Meanwhile, Radovan has phoned the police to report the drug delivery. JW grabs a weapon and holds off the Serbians as the police arrive and a firefight breaks out. JW and Jorge escape to the rooftop and eventually get to a car. Mrado's friend is seriously wounded, but intends to hold off the others so that Mrado can escape. As Mrado runs from an alley, he is hit and seriously injured by the car with Jorge and JW in it. JW, the least injured of the three, is angry with Mrado who had promised that no one would get hurt. JW shoots Mrado. JW then fires shots at the policemen closing in, thereby allowing Jorge to escape in the car. JW then surrenders to the police. Mrado is taken away by ambulance and calls his daughter on the way to the hospital. Jorge drives off into a forest and is last seen running through a field similar to the field that he ran through after escaping from prison.
The movie ends with JW in prison with tattoos of "JW" and "Camilla" on his arms. He is visited by Sophie who still cares deeply for JW, but she is leaving Sweden to stay at her parents' house in France. She asks JW if he cares for her. JW appears to care for Sophie, but says nothing. As Sophie leaves, she relays a message from Jorge who says that Paola had a baby girl. JW says that if Jorge calls again, tell him that '"Mr. Brains" says 'Hello.'"

Production
Jens Lapidus released the novel Snabba cash in 2006. It received praise from critics and was a success in terms of sales. Ever since it came out, Swedish director Daniel Espinosa dreamed of getting the opportunity to adapt it into a film. The opportunity came only a few years later when he met film producer Fredrik Wikström who asked him to direct the film. Espinosa has said that the book is important to him because of his Chilean roots and because he was raised in the Swedish suburbs. "When I lived in Skogås there were not so many Chileans, so I hung out with Yugoslavians [...] until I was 17 years old. Then a lot of crazy stuff happened and I ended up at Sigtuna with a bunch of upper class brats."
Joel Kinnaman was cast in the lead role of Johan "JW" Westlund. He told Helsingborgs Dagblad that "It is a difficult role and a difficult character to play. I love my character deeply, but he makes a lot of decisions in life that are idiotic and he chooses paths that lead to disaster and that gets unbelievably painful consequences for both him and the people that mean something to him." Filming began in March 2009 in Stockholm. Other shooting locations include Gothenburg and Germany (9–11 June 2009).
In December 2009 Lapidus told the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet that he had seen an early version of the film and "it feels good. The film is based on my book, but is at the same time a story of its own. Naturally my main characters are in it and they have managed to capture the authentic feel, but I haven't written the manuscript, I've only given pointers." Lapidus has written two back-to-back sequels to Snabba cash, which are also to be adapted into films. Filming began in the summer of 2011 with Babak Najafi as director and most of the main cast members from the first film. Easy Money II: Hard to Kill was released in August 2012 and the second sequel Easy Money III: Life Deluxe was released on 30 August 2013.
Distribution
Easy Money was released in Sweden on 15 January 2010. At the Berlin Film Festival that year it raised international interest. The American film studio The Weinstein Company soon acquired the rights, after a bidding war, to distribute the film in the United States, Germany, and Italy.
Remake
After a bidding on the project, involving Warner Bros., Universal Studios, Summit Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, The Weinstein Company, and Mandate Pictures - Warner Bros. won the rights to produce an American remake. Zac Efron will star in and produce the film.
Fredrik Wikström, a producer of Swedish film, will also be a producer on Warner Bros.'s remake. He commented on the hype of the original film in Sweden: "We had a huge hype for the film before anyone had even seen it; everyone was hoping it would be the next Stieg Larsson. The film premiered January 15 in Sweden, and the eyes were on us from the start. Somehow a bootleg DVD of the film made it to L.A. and was passed around. We started getting calls. Less than three months later we did the deal with Warner Bros."
Reception
Easy Money was an instant hit in Sweden with more than 100,000 tickets sold during the film's first weekend in theaters, topping the box office charts. Aftonbladet critic Karolina Fjellborg gave it four out of five stars, commenting that Espinosa "has made a believable, well-acted, nice-looking, and surprisingly thrilling film, with a nerve and a pace that is often missing in Swedish thrillers." She also praised the cast of the film, Kinnaman in particular. Expressens Miranda Sigander wrote that Kinnaman plays JW "in a natural and convincing way and steals the show with his charisma." Mats Johnson of Göteborgs-Posten gave the film a 3/5 rating for "the realism and the intensity in the best scenes of the film, and for the convincing acting by the main cast members." He added, however, that the film lacks coherence and that the story becomes disjointed because of the constant jumps between the three main characters. Sveriges Television's Jerker Peterson, on the other hand, thought that Espinosa and his writer Maria Karlsson were able to "nicely keep together the straggling story." He gave the film a rating of four out of five and commented that it is "altogether a really sharp thriller and a good start to the Swedish film year." In his book Swedish Sensationsfilms: A Clandestine History of Sex, Thrillers, and Kicker Cinema, Daniel Ekeroth notes that the movie is, unlike many other Swedish crime films, "without any tired old inspectors" and that that fact is "reason enough for praise!" He continues by saying that Snabba Cash has "sharp pacing, a fresh storyline, and above all a sinister portrayal of Stockholm as a cold and dark place.".

Androstanolone, or stanolone, also known as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and sold under the brand name Andractim among others, is an androgen and anabolic steroid (AAS) medication and hormone which is used mainly in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men. It is also used to treat breast development and small penis in males. It is typically given as a gel for application to the skin, but can also be used as an ester by injection into muscle.
Side effects of androstanolone include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. The medication is a naturally occurring androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and DHT. It has strong androgenic effects and weak muscle-building effects, as well as no estrogenic effects.
Androstanolone was discovered in 1935 and was introduced for medical use in 1953. It is used mostly in France and Belgium. The drug has been used by weightlifters to increase performance due to its powerful androgenic properties. The medication is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit.
Medical uses
Androstanolone is available in pharmaceutical formulations for medical use as an androgen. It is used mainly as a form of androgen replacement therapy in the treatment of male hypogonadism and is specifically approved for this indication in certain countries. However, it is no longer recommended for this purpose due to biological differences from testosterone such as lack of estrogenic effects and partial androgenic effects. Topical androstanolone is useful in the treatment of gynecomastia. Similarly, androstanolone enanthate via intramuscular injection has been found to be effective in the treatment persistent pubertal gynecomastia. The medication has also been used as a topical gel to treat small penis in pre- and peripubertal boys with mild or partial androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Androstanolone was found to be effective in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in women in the 1950s, although it was used in very high doses and caused severe virilization. It was used as a microcrystalline aqueous suspension by intramuscular injection. Shortly thereafter, drostanolone propionate (2α-methylandrostanolone propionate) was developed for this use instead of androstanolone due to its superior pharmacokinetics and was introduced for this indication in the United States and Europe in the early 1960s.
Androstanolone was used at a dose of 25 mg sublingually two to three times per day in androgen replacement therapy for men. This is also the anabolic dosage of androstanolone in men.
Available forms
Androstanolone is available as a 2.5% hydroalcoholic gel given transdermally in doses of 5 or 10 g/day (brand name Andractim). The medication was previously available as a 10 mg oral tablet with 300 mg L-lysine (brand name Lysinex) and as a 25 mg sublingual tablet (brand names Anabolex, Anaprotin, Anabolene, Anaboleen, Proteina). The medication has also been marketed in the form of several androstanolone esters, including androstanolone benzoate (brand names Ermalone-Amp, Hermalone, Sarcosan), androstanolone enanthate (brand name Anaboleen Depot), androstanolone propionate (brand name Pesomax), and androstanolone valerate (brand name Apeton), which are provided as oil solutions for intramuscular injection at regular intervals.
Side effects
Adverse effects of androstanolone are similar to those of other AAS and include androgenic side effects like oily skin, acne, seborrhea, increased facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, and increased aggressiveness and sex drive. In women, androstanolone can cause partially irreversible virilization, for instance voice deepening, hirsutism, clitoromegaly, breast atrophy, and muscle hypertrophy, as well as menstrual disturbances and reversible infertility. In men, the medication may also cause hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.
Androstanolone can have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, especially with long-term administration of high dosages. AAS like androstanolone stimulate erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) and increase hematocrit levels and at high dosages can cause polycythemia (overproduction of red blood cells), which can greatly increase the risk of thrombic events such as embolism and stroke. Unlike many other AAS, androstanolone is not aromatized into estrogens and hence has no risk of estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia, fluid retention, or edema. In addition, as it is not a 17α-alkylated AAS and is administered parenterally, androstanolone has no risk of hepatotoxicity.
It has been theorized that androstanolone may have less risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer than testosterone because it is not aromatized into estrogens. This is relevant because estrogens are thought to possibly be necessary for the manifestation of these diseases. In accordance, androstanolone has been found to not increase prostate gland size in men. Conversely, due to lack of aromatization into estrogens, androstanolone therapy for androgen replacement may result in decreased bone mineral density, incomplete effects in the brain, and undesirable changes in cholesterol levels.
Pharmacology
Pharmacodynamics
Androstanolone is a potent agonist of the AR. It has an affinity (Kd) of 0.25 to 0.5 nM for the human AR, which is about 2- to 3-fold higher than that of testosterone (Kd = 0.4 to 1.0 nM) and the dissociation rate of androstanolone from the AR is also about 5-fold slower than that of testosterone. The EC50 of androstanolone for activation of the AR is 0.13 nM, which is about 5-fold stronger than that of testosterone (EC50 = 0.66 nM). In bioassays, androstanolone has been found to be 2.5- to 10-fold more potent than testosterone. Upon intramuscular injection in rats, androstanolone is about 1.5- to 2.5-fold the potency of testosterone.
Unlike testosterone and various other AAS, androstanolone cannot be aromatized, and for this reason, poses no risk of estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia at any dosage. In addition, androstanolone cannot be metabolized by 5α-reductase (as it is already 5α-reduced), and for this reason, is not potentiated in so-called "androgenic" tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland, thereby improving its ratio of anabolic to androgenic effects. However, androstanolone is nonetheless described as a very poor anabolic agent. This is attributed to its high affinity as a substrate for 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD), which is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and inactivates androstanolone into 3α-androstanediol, a metabolite with very weak AR activity. Unlike androstanolone, testosterone is very resistant to metabolism by 3α-HSD, and so is not similarly inactivated in skeletal muscle. For the preceding reasons, androstanolone has been described as a "partial androgen".
Pharmacokinetics
Absorption
The bioavailability of androstanolone differs considerably depending on its route of administration. Its oral bioavailability is very low, and androstanolone has been considered to be ineffective by the oral route. However, it has been used orally, and is described as a weak AAS by this route. The transdermal bioavailability of androstanolone is approximately 10%. Its bioavailability with intramuscular injection, on the other hand, is complete (100%).
Doses of topical androstanolone gel of 16, 32, and 64 mg have been found to produce total testosterone and DHT levels in the low, mid, and high normal adult male range, respectively.
Distribution
The plasma protein binding of androstanolone is about 98.5 to 99.0%. It is bound 50 to 80% to sex hormone-binding globulin, 20 to 40% to albumin, and less than 0.5% to corticosteroid-binding globulin, with about 1.0 to 1.5% circulating freely or unbound.
Metabolism
The terminal half-life of androstanolone in the circulation (53 minutes) is longer than that of testosterone (34 minutes), and this may account for some of the difference in their potency. A study of transdermal androstanolone and testosterone therapy reported terminal half-lives of 2.83 hours and 1.29 hours, respectively.
Chemistry
Androstanolone, also known as 5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one or as 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), is a naturally occurring androstane steroid with a ketone group at the C3 position and a hydroxyl group at the C17β position. It is the derivative of testosterone in which the double bond between the C4 and C5 positions has been reduced or hydrogenated.
Esters
Several C17β ester prodrugs of androstanolone, including androstanolone benzoate, androstanolone enanthate, androstanolone propionate, and androstanolone valerate, have been developed and introduced for medical use as AAS. Conversely, dihydrotestosterone acetate, dihydrotestosterone butyrate, and dihydrotestosterone formate have been developed but have not been marketed.

History
Androstanolone was first discovered and synthesized in 1935 by Adolf Butenandt and his colleagues. It was first introduced for medical use in 1953, under the brand name Neodrol in the United States, and was subsequently marketed in the United Kingdom and other European countries. Transdermal androstanolone gel has been available in France since 1982.
Society and culture
Generic names
When used as a drug, androstanolone is referred to as androstanolone () or as stanolone () rather than as DHT.
Brand names
Brand names of androstanolone include Anaboleen, Anabolex, Anaprotin (), Andractim (formerly AndroGel-DHT) (, , ), Androlone, Apeton, Gelovit (), Neodrol, Ophtovital (), Pesomax (), Stanaprol, and Stanolone, among others.
Availability
The availability of pharmaceutical androstanolone is limited; it is not available in the United States or Canada, but it is or has been available in certain European countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Luxembourg.
The available formulations of androstanolone include buccal or sublingual tablets (Anabolex, Stanolone), topical gels (Andractim, Gelovit, Ophtovital), and, as esters in oil, injectables like androstanolone propionate (Pesomax) and androstanolone valerate (Apeton). Androstanolone benzoate (Ermalone-Amp, Hermalone, Sarcosan) and androstanolone enanthate (Anaboleen Depot) are additional androstanolone esters that are available for medical use in some countries. Androstanolone esters act as prodrugs of androstanolone in the body and have a long-lasting depot effect when given via intramuscular injection.
Legal status
Androstanolone, along with other AAS, is a schedule III controlled substance in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act.
Androstanolone is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of prohibited substances, and is therefore banned from use in most major sports.
Research
In the early- to mid-2000s, transdermal or topical androstanolone was under development in the United States for the treatment of hypogonadism (as a form of androgen replacement therapy), male osteoporosis, and cachexia (in cancer patients) and in Australia for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It reached phase II clinical trials for hypogonadism and BPH and phase III clinical studies for cachexia but development was ultimately never completed for these indications in these specific countries. Although androstanolone itself has not been approved for cachexia in any country, an orally active synthetic derivative of androstanolone, oxandrolone (2-oxa-17α-methylandrostanolone), is approved and used for this indication in the United States.
Topical androgens like androstanolone have been used and studied in the treatment of cellulite in women. Topical androstanolone on the abdomen has also been found to significantly decrease subcutaneous abdominal fat in women, and hence may be useful for improving body silhouette. However, men and hyperandrogenic women have higher amounts of abdominal fat than healthy women, and androgen therapy has been found to increase abdominal fat in postmenopausal women and transgender men.

Elena de' Grimani, also known as Ombra (February 26, 1975), is an Italian comics artist and illustrator, author of the character Rigel.
Biography and career
Born in Rome in the year 1975, she studies at Liceo Artistico Sant'Orsola, where she gets her degree in 1994, then she studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti (painting) and specialized at the Scuola romana dei fumetti. She started a sport career as an horserider when she was a teenager, but had to quit at 20 due to an accident. Her love for comics and Disney animation, and the discovery of Manga as Video Girl Ai of Masakazu Katsura are part of her decision to build a career in comics and figurative arts; she then develops her own style as a graphical mix between realistic and Manga elements.
Her first steps in the comicbook world happened in 1999, at Lucca Comics, with the self-publication of the first book of Rigel, an urban fantasy adventure of a contemporary vampire. After three number plus the spin-off Tinebra, she stops to self publish and co-produce a new comicbook with Rock'n'Comics, the prototype of the soon to follow comicbook Luna, then starts immediately to publish with Panini Comics a four number short series (each one composed of 96 pg.) named Rigel Interlunium (2001), a remake/restyling of Rigel and Tinebra with the help of Fabrizio Palmieri for parts of the screenplay.

While in Vegas, they work with Isha Thomas (Sridevi Kumar), a 9-1-1 dispatcher who receives several calls for help; Batten, the chief police inspector of the Las Vegas Police Department; and Swetha Menon, a Malayali dispatcher from Kozhikode. On one such phone call, Isha gets a call from Jennifer Edward Rubis, who tells her that a man has entered her house. Much to the man's demise, Jennifer is able to escape out of an upstairs window. Akilan and Baskar later figure out that the man who entered Jennifer's house was Lucifer Fernando (Justin Vikash), a psychopath who murders girls for their blood type (B+) to "purify" his blood. Lucifer is taking a Sri Lankan Tamil woman, Mathangai Kumaravel (Athmiya Rajan), hostage. While searching for details about Lucifer, Akilan learns of Kasie, Lucifer's ex-wife who filed a divorce after she learned that he was flirting with another woman.

The Tower of Unity (German: Turm der Einheit) is a observation tower on Heldrastein, a rocky mountain belonging to Treffurt in Thuringia. The tower of Unity has an unusual history and is also from unusual design, because it is additionally guyed by anchoring wires, although it is actually free standing. The tower of Unity was built in 1962 as transmitting tower for a radar station. At that time it was an open steel lattice tower additionally guyed with the radar facility on its top. The area of this tower was not accessible for tourists at those days as it laid in the restricted area of the former border between West and East Germany. In 1989, when the border was opened, the area became again accessible for the public and the desire developed to build on Heldrastein again an observation tower, as there was until 1952 an observation tower built of stones, the such called Carl Alexander tower there. In 1996 finally permission for the transformation of the radar tower into an observation tower could be received. In order to do this changes, which cost 205,000 DM, the radome on the top was removed and the tower body was covered with wood. In addition the tower got a stairway with 166 steps and an octagonal shelter at the tower basement.

Eugene B. Borowitz (February 20, 1924 – January 22, 2016) was an American leader and philosopher in Reform Judaism, known largely for his work on Jewish theology and Jewish ethics. He also edited a Jewish journal, Sh'ma, and taught at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion.
He was awarded the Maurice N. Eisendrath Bearer of Light Award by the Union for Reform Judaism (2005), selected as a Scholar of Distinction for a retrospective on his work by the Jewish Publication Society (2002) and given the Jewish Cultural Achievement medal for scholarship by the National Foundation for Jewish Culture. He received the National Jewish Book Award (1974) for The Mask Jews Wear. Jewish Spiritual Journeys: Essays in Honor of Eugene B. Borowitz on his 70th Birthday was published in his honor in 1997.
As is apparent from a bibliography of his works, Borowitz was a prolific author.
During the Korean War, he served as a chaplain for the U.S. Navy. Borowitz held degrees from Ohio State University, Columbia University and HUC-JIR.
Early life
Borowitz grew up in Columbus, Ohio, and attended Ohio State University. After graduation, he went to Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, where he was ordained as a Rabbi in 1948 and received his D.H.L. in 1950.
Career
Borowitz became the founding rabbi of the Community Synagogue in Port Washington, New York, while at the same time pursuing a PhD. in religion from the joint program sponsored by Columbia University and Union Theological Seminary. In 1957, he was appointed as director of the Religious Education Department of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. Because of this, he switched to Columbia's doctoral program in education and received the Ed.D. in 1958. From 1962 until his death, he was a faculty member at the New York campus of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, where he became the Sigmund L. Falk Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Education and Jewish Religious Thought. He was elected as the first Jewish president of the American Theological Society in 1981 and served until 1982 He celebrated his hundredth semester with the college in 2012.
Borowitz is best known for his development of "covenant theology," a term he first introduced in a 1961 article in Commentary. His work concerned itself with the dilemma of the postmodern Jew: committed to individual autonomy, but nevertheless involved with God, Torah and Israel. His interest in redefining covenant led him to significant work in normative ethics, some of which was collected in his book Exploring Jewish Ethics (264), and his teaching on the subject led to the volume, Reform Jewish Ethics and the Halakhah (298). Borowitz's work in covenant theology found its mature expression in his 1991 book, Renewing the Covenant (273).
One of Borowitz's most significant accomplishments was his founding of Sh'ma, a Journal of Jewish Responsibility in 1970. He was its publisher and editor for twenty-three years, and he served as Senior Editor from 1993 to 1997. Sh'ma provided a forum where voices from all segments of the Jewish community could be heard on a wide range of controversial topics. Borowitz wrote numerous short book reviews for Sh'ma.
Personal life
Borowitz died on January 22, 2016 at the age of 91 at his home in Stamford, Connecticut.

Frank Joseph Petrarca (July 31, 1918 – July 31, 1943) was a United States Army soldier and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration—the Medal of Honor—for his actions in World War II.
Biography
Petrarca joined the Army from his birth city of Cleveland, Ohio in October 1940, and by July 27, 1943, was serving as a private first class in the Medical Detachment of the 145th Infantry Regiment, 37th Infantry Division. On that day, during the Battle of Munda Point, at Horseshoe Hill on New Georgia in the Solomon Islands, he provided aid to three wounded soldiers despite intense enemy fire. Two days later, on July 29, he helped another wounded soldier who had been partially buried during a mortar barrage. On July 31, he again braved intense hostile fire to aid a wounded comrade, but was killed before he could reach the soldier. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor five months later, on December 23, 1943.
Petrarca, killed on his 25th birthday, was buried at Calvary Cemetery in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio.
Medal of Honor citation
Private First Class Petrarca's official Medal of Honor citation reads:
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action above and beyond the call of duty. Pfc. Petrarca advanced with the leading troop element to within 100 yards of the enemy fortifications where mortar and small-arms fire caused a number of casualties. Singling out the most seriously wounded, he worked his way to the aid of Pfc. Scott, lying within 75 yards of the enemy, whose wounds were so serious that he could not even be moved out of the direct line of fire. Pfc Petrarca fearlessly administered first aid to Pfc. Scott and 2 other soldiers and shielded the former until his death. On 29 July 1943, Pfc. Petrarca. during an intense mortar barrage, went to the aid of his sergeant who had been partly buried in a foxhole under the debris of a shell explosion, dug him out, restored him to consciousness and caused his evacuation. On 31 July 1943 and against the warning of a fellow soldier, he went to the aid of a mortar fragment casualty where his path over the crest of a hill exposed him to enemy observation from only 20 yards distance. A target for intense knee mortar and automatic fire, he resolutely worked his way to within 2 yards of his objective where he was mortally wounded by hostile mortar fire. Even on the threshold of death he continued to display valor and contempt for the foe, raising himself to his knees, this intrepid soldier shouted defiance at the enemy, made a last attempt to reach his wounded comrade and fell in glorious death.
Posthumous honors
The U.S. Army ship which served in the Pacific Ocean at the end of World War II was named in his honor.
One of the small arms ranges at Ohio National Guard Training Site, Camp Perry, Ohio, is named in honor of Pvt. Petrarca. Camp Perry is the home of the National Rifle and Pistol Championships.

Kuntillet Ajrud () is a late 9th/early 8th centuries BCE site in the northeast part of the Sinai Peninsula. It is frequently described as a shrine, though this is not certain.
Excavations
Kuntillet Ajrud (Arabic كونتيلة عجرود) is in north Sinai; carbon-14 dating indicates occupation in the period 801–770 BCE, and the texts may have been written c.800 BCE. As a perennial water source in this arid region it constituted an important station on an ancient trade route connecting the Gulf of Aqaba (an inlet of the Red Sea) and the Mediterranean, and was in addition located only 50 kilometers from the major oasis of Kadesh Barnea.
The site then known as "Contellet Garaiyeh", was identified in 1869 by Edward Henry Palmer as "Gypsaria" on the Tabula Peutingeriana: "Our own route, however, from Contellet Garaiyeh to the ruins in Lussan, was, as may be seen from the map, within a mile or so of the distance between Gypsaria and Lysa; and our discovery at the first-mentioned place of the remains of an ancient fort, renders its identity with the third station on the list more than probable."
The site was excavated in 1975/76 by Tel Aviv University archaeologist , and the excavation report was published in 2012. The fortress-like main building is divided into two rooms, one large and the other small, both with low benches. Both rooms contained various paintings and inscriptions on the walls and on two large water-jars (pithoi), one found in each room.
The paintings on the pithoi show various animals, stylised trees, and human figures, some of which may represent gods. They appear to have been done over a fairly considerable period and by several different artists, and do not form coherent scenes. The iconography is entirely Syrian/Phoenician and lacks any connection to the Egyptian models commonly found in Iron Age IIB Israel art.
The Kuntillet Ajrud inscriptions discovered in the excavations are significant in biblical archaeology.

The black-backed antshrike (Thamnophilus melanonotus) is a species of bird in the family Thamnophilidae. It is found in Colombia and Venezuela, where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests.
The black-backed antshrike was described by the English zoologist Philip Sclater in 1855 and given the binomial name Thamnophilus melanonotus. It was subsequently placed in the genus Sakesphorus. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2007 found that Sakesphorus was polyphyletic and that three species including the black-backed antshrike were embedded within a clade containing members of Thamnophilus. The black-backed antshrike was therefore moved back to its original genus.

Sri Rakum School for the Blind is a school for the visually impaired in the city of Bangalore, India. It offers free education to blind students from kindergarten to post-graduation. The training imparted includes reading and writing through Braille and mobility training for totally blind children. Pre-school aged students with the single disability of blindness are trained early on to prepare them for their eventual completion of school, college and vocational education.
Founder
The school was founded by Acharya Sri Rakum in June 1998. He left behind a career in martial arts in Japan and India to pursue what he calls the "creative use of his power". He is currently the principal of this school. The realization that children who were born blind were shunned and denied opportunities to grow inspired him to start the school. Children come from villages and tribal belts and come from very poor families. The school is a non-governmental organization running entirely on support by patrons and donations by the general public and corporate organizations.

Black Army Jacket was an American powerviolence band. They released one album and many 7" EPs, splits and compilation appearances. Their members have gone on to play in such bands as Municipal Waste, Deny the Cross, Matt Pond PA, Burnt by the Sun and Hope Collapse.
Biography
The band was started by Andrew Orlando (ex-guitarist of Milhouse and owner of Reservoir Records) and Carlos Ramirez after they met at a Fugazi show on Long Island, NY. They were both fans of bands like Terrorizer, Assück and Napalm Death and wanted to create a band in those styles. Halfman drummer Dan Crowell and Adverse Possession, Those of Us bassist Chris Russo were quickly recruited. They were both in high school at the time. The band rehearsed original material for a few weeks until scene veteran Rob Lawi joined in on lead vocals. BAJ entered NYC's LoHo Studios a few months later and recorded what would become their 1996 demo. The tape caused a small buzz in the hardcore and metal zine world and made many tape trader lists.
Queens, NY-based Chainsaw Safety Records would go on to release the band's The Path of Two Swords As One 7" and the band started to tour regionally shortly after. During the sessions for the aforementioned release, they recorded several more songs for future releases at NJ's Sweetwood Sound with current Dalek member Alap Momin behind the boards. Around this time both Crowell and Russo left the band and continued to play in Prom King with Mike Delorenzo of C.R. and Serpico, Brian Meehan of Milhouse and Loyal to None, and Ben Knight. Not long after they quit, Dave Witte joined the band on drums. Now a four-piece, they toured with California's Benumb and Noothgrush. This period proved to be fruitful for the group with many releases hitting stores and awareness growing.
In 1998, BAJ was invited to play the annual Milwaukee Metalfest along with bands including Destruction, Mercyful Fate, Death and Brutal Truth. They also went on to perform at that year's Fiesta Grande festival at Berkley, CA's Gilman St. club, organized by Spazz bassist/vocalist and Slap-A-Ham Records founder, Chris Dodge. The band wrote throughout the year and entered the studio with Dean Rispler (Killing Time, 25 ta Life) in the producer chair. The resulting album, 222, saw the musicians incorporating hints of death and black metal along with some more traditional elements of hardcore to their sound. They toured extensively to support their debut.
Relapse Records approached the band with an offer to release an EP of new material. They recorded a batch of new songs but Rob Lawi and the band parted ways shortly afterwards. Bassist Carlos Ramirez then became their vocalist and New Jersey native Tom Hayden joined in to fill the bass slot. Another native Jersey musician, John Adubato, was also asked to join to make Black Army Jacket a two guitar unit. Orlando and Ramirez were both huge fans of John's previous band, Times Up. Witte happened to be friends with the guitarist and he quickly jumped in just in time for some touring with the new lineup.
They came home from tour in mid-1999 and began to write newer, more technical material. They even talked about changing their name to get a fresh start. However, after a tough show in Worcester, MA the band decided to break up. Adubato and Witte then formed Burnt by the Sun, whilst Ramirez started melodic rockers Lakota a few years later. Andrew Orlando went on to join Anodyne and then Disnihil in the early 2000s (decade). Witte, Orlando and Ramirez recorded an EP under the name Hope Collapse in the mid-'00s, and are currently both in Deny the Cross, a powerviolence band that also features Dan Lactose (Spazz) and Ramon Salcido (Agents of Satan).
In 2006, Black Box Recordings released a Black Army Jacket semi-discography entitled Closed Casket. It featured their 1996 demo, assorted splits 7"s with Spazz, Corrupted, Noothgrush and Agathocles, and their unreleased Relapse Records EP.
Black Army Jacket reunited for 2010's Best Friends Day festival in Richmond, VA. The band's first set in over 12 years will be on August 19, on the first day of the festival. They also played a NYC show on August 4 at The Cake Shop. The lineup was Lawi, Orlando, Ramirez and Witte.
In 2014, Ramirez co-founded No Echo, a music website.

Zegyo Market (), located in central Mandalay, is the oldest and most important market in Mandalay.
History
Zegyo Market, covering 12 acres (4.86 hectares), was founded during the reign of King Mindon. It was a principal distribution centre for beans, citrus fruit, cotton, nuts, onions, rice, tobacco and wheat as well as the main market for jewellery and handicrafts such as silver and gold embroidery. The market was destroyed by fire in 1897, and rebuilt in 1903 with a masonry structure designed by an Italian, Count Conte Calderari. In the 1990s, the colonial era structure was pulled down and replaced with a Chinese-style shopping centre.

Jerome Noel Jumonville (December 5, 1941 – December 7, 2019), better known as Jerry Jumonville, was an American jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll saxophonist, arranger, and composer. He began playing the saxophone as teenager. Jumonville was a musician for albums and television series.
Personal life and early career
Jumonville was born on December 5, 1941, as Jerome Noel Jumonville, and he grew up in the Carrollton section of New Orleans. His father was a hobby shop owner. During his summer vacation, before attending his first year of high school, his mother borrowed a saxophone from a friend for Jumonville to play. He played his first alto with that saxophone. As a teenager during the late 1950s, Jumonville was a fan of New Orleans musicians including Fats Domino and Smiley Lewis. He was interested in playing the saxophone due to how prominent it was on many rhythm and blues and bebop jazz records during the 1950s. When he was in high school, Jumonville started a R&B band called the Matadors. Jumonville backed Ray Charles and James Brown while they played in New Orleans.
Professional career
Jumonville started his music career by emulating jazz musician David "Fathead" Newman. Jumonville gave credit to Ray Charles for telling him to stop trying to copy Newman, which Jumonville followed. While he was a session musician, Jumonville played the saxophone for Rod Stewart's song "Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)". He played the saxophone for the soundtrack to the film The Rose, for the album Toulouse Street by The Doobie Brothers, and various other tracks by significant artists. His music was influenced by tenor players Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis and Gene Ammons, as well as swing players Illinois Jacquet and Ben Webster.
When the 1970s television series Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley featured a band, Jumonville was usually part of it. Jumonville was based in Los Angeles for much of the 1960s through the 1980s. His album Jump City was released in 1986. Jumonville's 2004 recordings for the 2008 album You Are My Dream were not destroyed during Hurricane Katrina due to the ADAT tapes being up high in a recording studio. After returning to New Orleans, he frequently played in local clubs.
Death
Jumonville died on December 7, 2019, in New Orleans. A celebration of his life was held at Buffa's Bar and Restaurant on December 21, 2019.

Angidi Verriah Chettiar (அங்கிடி செட்டியார்) (29 April 1928 – 15 September 2010) was a Mauritian politician who served twice as the second vice president of Mauritius until his death in September 2010.
Early life
Angidi Chettiar was born in Aruppukkottai in Virudhunagar district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. He came to Mauritius at the age of 10. His family were traders.
Political career
Angidi Chettiar throughout his political career was a staunch member of the Mauritius Labour Party. He served the party for more than 50 years and held the position of treasurer of the party for a few decades. Before being appointed Vice-President of Mauritius, Angidi Chettiar was a member of the Legislative Assembly for many years, serving as Government Chief Whip and eventually Minister in the Government of Prime Minister Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam from 1980 to 1982.
He served a first term as vice president from 1997 to 2002, and he briefly became acting president in 2002 when Cassam Uteem resigned. However, Chettiar also resigned within days after refusing to sign a controversial anti-terrorism bill, saying that the bill was discriminatory against Muslims. The line of succession then bestowed the presidential powers and duties onto Supreme Court Justice Ariranga Pillay.
After the come-back of Navin Ramgoolam, current Leader of Mauritius Labour Party, to power, Chettiar was reappointed as Vice-President of Mauritius for a second term by the President of Mauritius, Anerood Jugnauth, in 2007.
He died while serving as vice president on 15 September 2010. He suffered from health problems for a few months before his death. He is survived by four sons and one daughter. Another son has already died.

USAir Flight 427 was a scheduled flight from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport to Palm Beach International Airport, Florida, with a stopover at Pittsburgh International Airport. On Thursday, September 8, 1994, the Boeing 737 flying this route crashed in Hopewell Township, Pennsylvania while approaching Runway 28R at Pittsburgh, which was at the time USAir's largest hub.
After the longest investigation in the history of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), it was determined that the probable cause was that the aircraft's rudder malfunctioned and went hard over in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots, causing the plane to enter an aerodynamic stall from which the pilots were unable to recover. All 132 people on board were killed, making the crash the deadliest air disaster in Pennsylvania's history.
Involved
Aircraft
The aircraft involved was a Boeing 737-3B7, registration N513AU, and previously registered as N382AU. The aircraft was delivered in 1987 and was powered by two
CFM56-3B2 engines. The aircraft had recorded approximately 18,800 hours of flight time before the crash.
Crew
The flight crew consisted of Captain Peter Germano, 45, who was hired by USAir in February 1981, and First Officer Charles B. "Chuck" Emmett III, 38, who was hired in February 1987 by Piedmont Airlines (which merged into USAir in 1989). Both were regarded as excellent pilots and were very experienced: Germano logged approximately 12,000 flight hours, including 4,064 on the Boeing 737, while Emmett logged 9,000 flight hours, 3,644 on the 737. Flight attendants Stanley Canty and April Slater were hired in 1989 by Piedmont Airlines. Flight attendant Sarah Slocum-Hamley was hired in October 1988 by USAir (now USAirways).
Crash
In its arrival phase approaching Pittsburgh, Flight 427 was sequenced behind Delta Air Lines Flight 1083, a Boeing 727-200. At no time was Flight 427 closer than to Delta 1083, according to radar data. Flight 427 was on approach at altitude, at flaps 1 configuration, and at approximately .
At 19:02:57, the aircraft entered the wake turbulence of Delta 1083, and three sudden thumps, clicking sounds and a louder thump occurred, after which the 737 began to bank and roll to the left. As the aircraft stalled, Germano exclaimed "Hold on!" numerous times, while Emmett, under physical exertion, said, "Oh shit!" Germano exclaimed, "What the hell is this?" As air traffic control noticed Flight 427 descending without permission, Germano keyed the mic and stated, "Four-twenty-seven, emergency!" Because the mic remained keyed for the rest of the incident, the ensuing exclamations in the cockpit were heard in the tower at Pittsburgh. The aircraft continued to roll while pitched nose-down at the ground. Trying to counteract sharply rising G-forces, Germano yelled "Pull!" three consecutive times before screaming, during which Emmett stated "God, no" seconds before impact. Pitched 80° nose-down and banked 60° left while traveling at approximately , the 737 slammed into the ground and exploded at 19:03:25 in Hopewell Township, Beaver County, near Aliquippa, approximately 28 seconds after entering the wake turbulence.
Investigation
The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the crash. All 127 passengers and five crew members were killed. For the first time in NTSB history, investigators were required to wear full-body biohazard suits while inspecting the accident site. As a result of the severity of the crash impact, the bodies of the passengers and crew were severely fragmented, leading investigators to declare the site a biohazard, requiring 2,000 body bags for the 6,000 recovered human remains. USAir had difficulty determining Flight 427's passenger list, facing confusion regarding five or six passengers. Several employees of the U.S. Department of Energy had tickets to take later flights, but used them to fly on Flight 427. One young child was not ticketed. Among the victims of the crash was noted neuroethologist Walter Heiligenberg.
Both the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) were recovered and used for the investigation. Because of the limited parameters recorded by the FDR, investigators did not have access to the position of the flight-control surfaces (rudder, ailerons, elevator, etc.) during the accident sequence. However, two parameters recorded were crucial: the aircraft's heading and the pitch-control yoke position. During the approach, Flight 427 encountered wake turbulence from Delta 1083, but the FAA determined "the wake vortex encounter alone would not have caused the continued heading change that occurred after 19:03:00." The abrupt heading change shortly before the dive pointed investigators immediately to the rudder. Without data relating to the rudder pedal positions, investigators attempted to determine whether the rudder moved hard over by a malfunction or by pilot command. The CVR was heavily scrutinized as investigators examined the pilots' words and their breathing to determine whether they were fighting for control over a rudder malfunction or had inadvertently stomped on the wrong rudder pedal in reaction to the wake turbulence. Boeing felt the latter more likely, while USAir and the pilots' union felt that the former was more likely. The FDR revealed that after the aircraft stalled, the plane and its occupants were subjected to a load as high as 4 g throughout the dive until impact with the ground in an 80-degree nose-down attitude at approximately 300 mph under significant sideslip.
Reading the control-yoke data from the FDR revealed that the pilots made a crucial error by pulling back on the yoke throughout the dive, with the stick shaker audible on the CVR from the onset of the dive. This raised the aircraft's angle of attack, removed all aileron authority, prevented recovery from the roll induced by the rudder and caused an aerodynamic stall. Because the aircraft had entered a slip, pulling back on the yoke only further aggravated the bank angle. Boeing's test pilots reenacted the dive in a simulator and in a test 737-300 by flying with the same parameters recorded by the accident FDR, and found that recovery from a fully deflected rudder at level flight, while at 190-knot crossover speed, was accomplished by turning the wheel to the opposite direction of the roll, and not pulling back on the yoke to regain aileron authority. The FAA later remarked that the CVR proved that the pilots failed to utilize proper crew resource management during the upset while continuing to apply full up elevator after receiving a stall warning. The NTSB remarked that no airline had ever trained a pilot to properly recover from the situation experienced by the Flight 427 pilots and that the pilots had just 10 seconds from the onset of the roll to troubleshoot before recovery of the aircraft was impossible.
Investigators later discovered that the recovered accident rudder power control unit was much more sensitive to bench tests than other new such units. The exact mechanism of the failure involved the servo valve, which remains dormant and cold for much of the flight at high altitude, seizing after being injected with hot hydraulic fluid that has been in continuous action throughout the plane. This specific condition occurred in fewer than 1% of the lab tests but explained the rudder malfunction that caused Flight 427 to crash. The jam left no trace of evidence after it occurred, and a Boeing engineer later found that a jam under this controlled condition could also lead to the slide moving in the opposite direction than that commanded. Boeing felt that the test results were unrealistic and inapplicable given the extremes under which the valve was tested. It stated that the cause of the rudder reversal was more likely psychological and likened the event to a circumstance in which an automobile driver panics during an accident and accidentally presses on the gas pedal rather than the brake pedal. The FAA's official position was that sufficient probable cause did not exist to substantiate the possibility of rudder system failure.
After the longest accident investigation in NTSB history — lasting more than four and a half years — the NTSB released its final report on March 24, 1999. The NTSB concluded that the accident was the result of mechanical failure:
The NTSB concluded that similar rudder problems had caused the previously mysterious March 3, 1991 crash of United Airlines Flight 585 and the June 9, 1996 incident involving Eastwind Airlines Flight 517, both Boeing 737s. The final report also included detailed responses to Boeing's arguments about the causes of the three accidents.
Aftermath
At the time of the crash, Flight 427 was the second-deadliest accident involving a Boeing 737 (all series); as of 2020, it now ranks as the ninth deadliest. It was also the seventh-deadliest aviation disaster in the history of the United States, and the deadliest in the U.S. involving a 737; as of 2020, it ranks eleventh. The accident marked USAir's fifth crash in the period from 1989 to 1994. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania spent approximately $500,000 in recovery and cleanup for the accident site.
The FAA disagreed with the NTSB's probable-cause verdict and Tom McSweeney, the FAA's director of aircraft certification, issued a statement on the same day on which the NTSB report was issued that read: "We believe, as much as we have studied this aircraft and this rudder system, that the actions we have taken assure a level of safety that is commensurate with any aircraft."
However, the FAA changed its attitude after a special task force, the Engineering Test and Evaluation Board, reported in July 2000 that it had detected 46 potential failures and jams in the 737 rudder system that could have catastrophic effects. In September 2000, the FAA announced that it wanted Boeing to redesign the rudder for all iterations of the 737, affecting more than 3,400 aircraft in the U.S. alone.
USAir submitted to the NTSB that pilots should receive training with regard to a plane's crossover speed and recovery from full rudder deflection. As a result, pilots were warned of and trained how to deal with insufficient aileron authority at an airspeed at or less than , formerly the usual approach speed for a Boeing 737. Boeing maintained that the most likely cause of the crash was that the co-pilot inadvertently deflected the rudder hard over in the wrong direction while in a panic and for unknown reasons maintained this input until impact with the ground. Boeing agreed to redesign the rudder control system with a redundant backup and paid to retrofit the entire worldwide 737 fleet. Following one of the NTSB's main recommendations, airlines were required to add four additional channels of information into flight data recorders in order to capture pilot rudder pedal commands, and the FAA set a deadline of August 2001 for airlines to comply. In 2016, former investigator John Cox stated that time has proven the NTSB correct in its findings because no additional rudder-reversal incidents have occurred since Boeing's redesign.
Following the airline's response to the Flight 427 accident, the United States Congress required airlines to deal more sensitively with the families of crash victims. USAir ceased using Flight 427 as a flight number. The crash was the second fatal USAir crash in just over two months, following the July 2 Flight 1016 accident at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport that killed 37. The crashes contributed to the financial crisis that USAir was experiencing at the time.
Memorial
The crash site itself, located near the Aliquippa exit of I-376, is located on private property. The road that is needed to access the site is only accessible to 427 Support Leagues and Pine Creek Land Trust members. Three tombstones are located at the Sewickley Cemetery, from the site of the crash and within the flight path of USAir 427.

Barney A. Ebsworth (July 14, 1934 – April 9, 2018) was an American corporate executive and art collector. He was one of the initial investors in the Build-A-Bear Workshop and was a pioneer in the travel industry. Ebsworth died on April 9, 2018.
Art collection
Ebsworth was a trustee of the St. Louis Art Museum and the Seattle Art Museum, a commissioner of the American Art Museum and Smithsonian Institution and a member of the Trustees Council and Co-Chairman of Collectors Committee of the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.
At a Christie's auction in 1997, Ebsworth purchased Wayne Thiebaud's Bakery Counter (1962), one of the artist's largest early still lifes, for $1.7 million; at the time, this was a record for the artist. In 2010, he sold Andy Warhol's Big Campbell's Soup Can With Can Opener (Vegetable), a 1962 painting with a can opener cutting into the signature can, for $23.8 million to raise money to finance a church designed by the Japanese architect Tadao Ando. He also owned the Edward Hopper painting Chop Suey (1929) and had promised it to the Seattle Art Museum. However, at his death, ownership transferred to his estate. In November 2018, the painting sold for a record $92 million.

The Saint-Jacques Escarpment () is a green space along an escarpment in the city of Montreal, west of downtown Montreal and adjacent to the neighbourhood of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. The wooded area stretches long, covering over .
The escarpment's dense stands of poplar trees and its location between Mount Royal and the Lachine Rapids make it notable for a number of species of resident and migratory birds and a large population of brown snakes.
The land at the foot of the escarpment was previously known as a body of water named "Lac St-Pierre". The lake started losing its water with the opening of the Lachine Canal in the year 1825.
The escarpment had served as a dumping ground before it was purchased by the City of Montreal for use as parkland, but it is not open to the public. Plans to allow public access have been delayed because parts of the slope are unstable and dangerous, and the city's desire to preserve the escarpment as a natural space conflicts with the Province of Quebec's plans for redevelopment of the Turcot Interchange, which include moving the Ville-Marie Expressway and Canadian National Railway line next to the foot of the escarpment.
In 2020, the city of Montreal announced a proposal to turn much of the space into a park that would stretch nearly .
In 2021, the long park was opened to the public. The west entrance is at Sainte-Anne de Bellevue Boulevard and Brock Avenue South. The east entrance is at Rue Pullman, just northwest of the Turcot Interchange.

Solar cycle 25 is the current solar cycle, the 25th since 1755, when extensive recording of solar sunspot activity began. It began in December 2019 with a minimum smoothed sunspot number of 1.8. It is expected to continue until about 2030.
Predictions
Widely varying predictions regarding the strength of cycle 25 ranged from very weak with suggestions of slow slide in to a Maunder minimum like state to a weak cycle similar to previous cycle 24 and even a strong cycle. Upton and Hathaway predicted that the weakness of cycle 25 would make it part of the Modern Gleissberg Minimum. One published prediction (of a very weak cycle) was retracted due to fundamental errors.
The Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel predicted in December 2019 that solar cycle 25 will be similar to , with the preceding solar cycle minimum in April 2020 (± 6 months), and the number of sunspots reaching a (smoothed) maximum of 115 in July 2025 (± 8 months). This prediction is in line with the current general agreement in the scientific literature, which holds that solar cycle 25 will be weaker than average (i.e. weaker than during the exceptionally strong Modern Maximum).
Early signs
As of April 2018, the Sun showed signs of a reverse magnetic polarity sunspot appearing and beginning this solar cycle. It is typical during the transition from one cycle to the next to experience a period where sunspots of both polarities exist (during the solar minimum). The polarward reversed polarity sunspots suggest that a transition to cycle 25 is in process. The first cycle 25 sunspots may have appeared in early April 2018 or even December 2016.
In November 2019, two reversed polarity sunspots appeared, possibly signaling the onset of cycle 25.
Nandy et al., analyzed the polarity orientation of bipolar magnetic regions observed in December 2019 and concluded that magnetic regions with the underlying orientation of solar cycle 25 toroidal field component were brewing in the solar convection zone, representing early signs of the new cycle.
Supersynoptic (time vs. solar latitude) map of the radial component of the solar magnetic field for cycles 24-25 based on observations from the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) shows magnetic activity of cycle 25 beginning November 2019 at about 30 degree latitudes in both solar hemispheres.
A more recent supersynoptic map is available.
The following table gives the number of days so far in cycle 25 (to Jul 16 2022), and up to the same point in cycle 24 (to Jul 16 2011), which have passed various thresholds for the numbers of sunspots:
As at Aug 17 2022, solar cycle 25 is averaging 31% more spots per day than solar cycle 24 at the same point in the cycle (Aug 17 2011).
Events
2020
On 29 May, the first C-class solar flares of Solar Cycle 25 took place, as well as the first M-class flare. Solar activity continued to increase in the following months, especially abruptly in October, with flares taking place on a near-daily basis by November. On 29 November, an M4.4 flare, the strongest of the cycle to date, took place, possibly indicating the solar cycle would be more active than initially thought.
On 8 December, a small coronal mass ejection was found heading directly towards Earth shortly after a strong C-class solar flare, hitting the planet on 9-10 December and causing bright aurorae at high latitudes.
2021
The first X-class solar flare of the cycle took place on 3 July, peaking at X1.59.
On 22 July, a total of six different active regions were seen on the solar disk for the first time since 6 September 2017.
On 9 October, a M1.6 class solar flare erupted sending a coronal mass ejection that hit earth on 12 October triggering a (moderate) G2 geomagnetic storm.
The second X-class flare of the solar cycle erupted on 28 October, producing a CME and a S1 solar radiation storm. Reports initially predicted that the CME could graze Earth, however geomagnetic storms on 30-31 October only reached a moderate K index of 4.
On 3 and 4 November, the K index reached 8-, equivalent to a G4 geomagnetic storm. This was the most intense geomagnetic storm to hit Earth since September 2017.
2022
In late March, sunspot region 2975 released X1.3 and M9.6 flares, the former causing a G1 geomagnetic storm on 31 March despite being near the solar limb. The region rotated out of view of Earth on 5 April, but helioseismic measurements on April 8 showed it still active on the far side of the Sun. On 12 April, a Coronal Mass Ejection on the far side likely erupted from the region, with helioseismic measurements showing the region to have intensified since crossing over the limb. As the region began rotating into view from Earth, a possibly X-class flare occurred on 15 April.
After rotating to the visible hemisphere of the Sun, the regions of the sunspot complex were designated 2993 through 2996. On 17 April, sunspot group 2994 released an X1.2 flare. However, the complex's activity subsided slightly in the next few days. While crossing the solar limb, sunspot region 2992 emitted M7.3 and X2.2 flares, the latter being the strongest of the cycle yet.

The Peace Information Center (PIC) was an anti-war organization based in the United States which provided information on peace initiatives in other countries, and promoted the Stockholm appeal. The organization was in existence from April 3 to October 12, 1950. Members included O. John Rogge, W. E. B. Du Bois, John T. McManus, Paul Robeson, C. B. Baldwin, Albert E. Kahn, Johannes Steel, Gene Weltfish, Leon Strauss, Elizabeth Moos, Kyrle Elkin, Abbot Simon and Shirley Graham.
W. E. B. Du Bois, a staunch opponent of nuclear weapons, was chairman of the Peace Information Center. It worked to publicize the Stockholm Peace Appeal in the United States. The primary purpose of the appeal was to gather signatures on a petition, asking world governments to ban all nuclear weapons. The PIC issued a publication called Peacegram that reported on international developments related to peace.
The U.S. Justice Department alleged that the PIC was acting as an agent of the Soviet Union, and thus required the PIC to register with the federal government. Du Bois and other PIC leaders refused, and they were indicted for failure to register. Some of Du Bois's associates distanced themselves from him and the NAACP refused to issue a statement of support, but many leftists and labor figures, including Langston Hughes, supported Du Bois. In late 1952, with defense attorney Vito Marcantonio arguing the case, the case was dismissed. The federal government confiscated Du Bois's passport during the PIC trial, and even though he was not convicted, they withheld it for eight years, because Du Bois had refused to sign a non-Communist affidavit.
In early 1951, following the dissolution of the PIC, DuBois and others established the American Peace Crusade.

XHABCJ-FM is a radio station on 95.9 FM in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.
History
XECCC-AM received its concession on November 25, 1980. It was owned by Sara Cabañas Rodríguez and joined the Promomedios family of "triple" callsign stations alongside XEAAA-AM 880 and XEBBB-AM 1040. XECCC cycled through many names and formats in its history.
In 2001, it carried the very short-lived Red W Interactiva talk network, which lasted three months. In 2003, it flipped to sports as Estadio 1440.
In 2005, XECCC was sold to OEM and changed its callsign to XEABCJ-AM. The concession transferred in 2010. As part of the sale, XEABCJ moved to XEAV's tower. After just one year with ABC Radio's talk programs, XEABCJ flipped to romantic as Corazón (2006-2008), tropical as La Estrella del Caribe (2008–14), grupera as La Feroz (2014) and lastly ABC Radio 1440 with romantic music.
In 2017, XEABCJ was authorized to migrate to FM as XHABCJ-FM. It began testing on the new frequency in May 2019.
In late June, the station began broadcasting test programming with a rock format. On July 1, 2019, the station formally launched as Rock 101, an extension of the Rock 101 online station created by Luis Gerardo Salas in 2016 (and patterned after the original Rock 101 in Mexico City) and the Rock 101 show already being distributed by ABC Radio. A year later, as required by the Federal Telecommunications Institute, the AM station signed off.
Rock 101 Guadalajara ended on November 30, 2021, and the station began primarily simulcasting XEAV-AM 580 "Canal 58", the other ABC station in Guadalajara, the next day.

Rosemary Márquez (born February 28, 1968) is a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona.
Early life and education
Márquez's parents, Miguel and Catalina Márquez, emigrated from Sonora, Mexico. Márquez was born in Los Angeles, California in 1968, but her family later moved to Bisbee, Arizona in order to be closer to Sonora. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1990 from the University of Arizona and a Juris Doctor from the University of Arizona College of Law in 1993.
Professional career
From 1994 until 1996, Márquez served as a public defender in Pima County, Arizona. From 1996 until 2000, she served as an assistant federal public defender. From 2000 to 2014, Márquez worked in private law practice in Tucson, Arizona, focusing her efforts on federal criminal defense.
Federal judicial service
During the 111th United States Congress, Democrats from the Arizona House delegation recommended Márquez to fill the vacancy on the United States District Court for the District of Arizona created by Judge Frank R. Zapata's decision to take senior status. On June 23, 2011, during the 112th Congress, President Obama formally nominated Márquez to serve as a judge for the District of Arizona. Due to opposition by Arizona Senators John McCain and Jon Kyl, both Republicans, her nomination did not receive a hearing in the 112th Congress. On January 2, 2013, her nomination was returned to the President, due to the sine die adjournment of the Senate. On January 3, 2013, she was renominated to the same office. On September 19, 2013, Senator McCain indicated that he would support the nomination of Márquez, as well as four other nominees made to the United States District Court for the District of Arizona on that day. Her hearing was before the Senate Judicial Committee on January 28, 2014, and her nomination was reported to the United States Senate by a vote of 15–2 on February 27, 2014. On May 13, 2014, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed for cloture on her nomination. On May 15, 2014, The Senate voted 58–35 on the motion to invoke cloture on her nomination. Later that same day, The Senate voted 81–15 in favor of final confirmation. She received her judicial commission on May 19, 2014.
Notable cases
In a August 30, 2021 ruling, Marquez threw out a Trump-era rule that permitted the draining and filling of streams, marshes, and wetlands, finding that leaving it in place would lead to "serious environmental harm".

Jan Derk Huibers (27 December 1829, Deventer - 7 April 1918, Zeist) was a Dutch painter, graphic artist and art teacher. He painted a wide variety of subjects, but is best known for his genre scenes. Some sources incorrectly give his year of death as 1919.
Life and work
He was the son of Jan Derk Huibers, a merchant, and his wife, Maria Elisabet née Fonck. His artistic education began with evening classes at the local drawing school, where his teacher was . He continued his studies at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Antwerp, and the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam.
After completing his studies, he stayed in Amsterdam; becoming a member of Arti et Amicitiae. In 1868, he became a teacher at the drawing school operated by the Maatschappij tot Nut van 't Algemeen, a charitable organization. That same year, he married Elisabet Gerarda Hendriks, and began participating in the Exhibition of Living Masters.
From 1872, he also taught at the drawing school in Zwolle. His painting "Away from Home" won the Royal Gold Medal at an Arti et Amicitiae exhibition in 1876. He became one of the first instructors at the newly established , a teacher training school, in 1881. He was also a board member of the Association for Drawing Education.
In 1895, he was named a Knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau. He retired from all his positions in 1901, and received a pension. His many familiar students include Huib Luns, Co Breman, Franz Deutmann, Leo Gestel, , , Kees Smout, Tjipke Visser and Dirk de Vries Lam.

The Jewish Women's Archive (JWA) is a national non-profit organization whose mission is to document "Jewish women's stories, elevate their voices, and inspire them to be agents of change."
JWA was founded by Gail Twersky Reimer in 1995 in Brookline, Massachusetts with the goal of using the Internet to increase awareness of and provide access to the stories of American Jewish women. JWA makes a growing collection of information, exhibits, and resources available via its website. Its activities include the conception, production and dissemination of:
Community-based oral history projects
Online exhibitions
Original academic research
Educational materials including curricula, a poster series and an oral history guide
Training Institutes for educators working in formal and informal settings
Documentary film
Starting in 2010, JWA also began holding an Annual Luncheon in New York City at which it honors three women for their activism and achievements. In 2010 the focus was on the Triangle Fire (2010 was the centenary of that tragedy). Honorees included Ruth J. Abram (co-founder of the Tenement Museum), Kate Frucher (attorney and entrepreneur), and journalist Lynn Sherr. In 2011 the luncheon was titled "Making Trouble / Making History." Gloria Steinem presented the awards, which were given to Elizabeth A. Sackler (The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, Brooklyn Museum), Rebecca Traister (author, Big Girls Don't Cry, journalist), and Letty Cottin Pogrebin (author, "Deborah, Golda, and Me," etc., journalist, founding editor, "Ms magazine").
Major programs and projects
Curricula and educational resources
JWA's most recent curriculum, Living the Legacy, focuses on the role of Jewish women in the Civil Rights Movement and labor movement, seeking to highlight their often-neglected but central role. Additional educational resources include 18 "Go & Learn" lesson plans, book and film guides, primary source materials and mother-daughter workshop materials. Previous curricula include Making Our Wilderness Bloom.
Online encyclopedia
The Shalvi/Hyman Encyclopedia of Jewish Women edited by Jennifer Sartori, formerly Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia edited by Paula Hyman and Dalia Ofer, is accessible for free via JWA's website. The encyclopedia features approximately 2,000 articles on the lives and achievements of Jewish women. Articles are also disseminated via Twitter.
Film
In 2007 JWA produced Making Trouble, a documentary film about three generations of female Jewish comedians and the complexity and challenges of their relationship to comedy, Judaism and gender. The film profiles Molly Picon, Fanny Brice, Sophie Tucker, Joan Rivers, Gilda Radner, and Wendy Wasserstein as well as contemporary comedians Judy Gold and Jackie Hoffman. The film has been screened at over 70 film festivals and other venues.
Podcast
The Jewish Women's Archive produced a podcast called Can We Talk? hosted by Nahanni Rous. Rous is also joined by Judith Rosenbaum and Ibby Caputo. The show released its first episode on January 26, 2016 and continued to release episodes on a monthly basis. Each episode is only about twenty minutes in length. The show interviews Jewish women about news, politics, and culture. In one episode the hosts interview Anita Diamant about her book The Red Tent. The show was featured in Steve Olsher's "Ultimate Directory of Podcasters" as one of the top ten podcasts about Judaism as well as one of the top ten religion and spirituality podcasts.

Jelena Nelipić (; died 1422) was Duchess of Split by her first marriage and Queen of Bosnia by her second marriage. By birth, she was a member of the Croatian Nelipić noble family, having estates in Dalmatian Zagora.
Jelena was the daughter of Prince Ivan II Nelipić and his wife Margareta. Her father was son of Ivan I Nelipac, and her mother Margareta was descended from the noble family Merini of Split. Her brother Ivan III Nelipac was Ban of Croatia who ruled from mountain Velebit to Cetina river.
Duchess of Split
In 1401, Jelena married Prince Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, a most prominent member of the Bosnian Hrvatinić noble family, and the strongest of the three main large feudalists of medieval Bosnia, bringing with her a significant dowry. Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić was Ban of Croatia, Grand Duke of Bosnia and Duke of Split. Two years later, she became Duchess of Split when her husband was created Duke of Split. Jelena was Roman Catholic, but her husband was a member of the Bosnian Church.
In 1416, Jelena's husband died. Being a wealthy widow left in charge with her late husband's territories, Jelena immediately became subject of marriage proposals.
Queen of Bosnia
Duchess Jelena married King Stephen Ostoja of Bosnia, thus becoming Queen of Bosnia. Her dowry included her first husband's possessions, such as the royal town of Jajce, and this dowry is the reason why Stephen Ostoja, who had divorced his second wife Kujava in 1415, married her. Her second husband was also a member of the Bosnian Church.
Second widowhood
Jelena's second marriage lasted much shorter than her first one. She became a widow again in 1418, after only two years of marriage. Her husband's successor was Stephen Ostojić, his son by his second wife Kujava. As dowager queen, Jelena had neither influence nor power. Kujava, the new king's mother and the second wife of Jelena's second husband, became powerful once again. Jelena's second widowhood was marked by conflicts with Kujava. The conflicts were ended in the summer of 1419, when Queen Jelena was imprisoned by her stepson. Three years later, Queen Jelena died in prison under mysterious circumstances.
Issue
It's possible that Balša Hercegović was Jelena's son from her first marriage, but it's not clear yet. Other than him, who could have been her child, Jelena had no other known children by either of her husbands.

"East St Louis Toodle-Oo" (also "Toodle-O") is a composition written by Duke Ellington and Bubber Miley and recorded several times by Ellington for various labels from 1926–1930 under various titles. This song was the first charting single for Duke Ellington in 1927 and was one of the main examples of his early "jungle music". This composition was covered by Steely Dan on their 1974 album Pretzel Logic.
Recording history
Ellington first recorded "Toodle-Oo" in November 1926 for Vocalion Records, which was released as Vo (1064). He recorded the composition twice more in early 1927 for Brunswick Records; the first version was not released at the time, but the second was released as Br (3480). He recorded his hit version in March 1927 for Columbia Records, under the name "the Washingtonians". Along with recording "Toodle-Oo", two other compositions were recorded at the same session, "Hop Head" and "Down in Our Alley Blues", the former of which would be released as the B-side of Columbia 953-D.

Music
"East St. Louis Toodle-Oo" features a growling plunger-muted trumpet part played by co-composer Bubber Miley, one of the first jazz trumpeters to utilize the style. This style was carried on by later Ellington trumpeters Cootie Williams (1937 recording), and Ray Nance (1956 recording).
For Steely Dan's 1974 cover of the song, Walter Becker played the melody through a talk box to imitate Miley's trumpet style, while Jeff "Skunk" Baxter used a pedal steel guitar for the trombone part.

Christopher Whitworth Whall (1849 – 23 December 1924) was a British stained-glass artist who worked from the 1880s and on into the 20th century. He is widely recognised as a leader in the Arts and Crafts Movement and a key figure in the modern history of stained glass.
Early life and studies
Christopher Whall was born in the rectory at Thurning, Northamptonshire, where his father, William Whall, was the rector. He was educated at home with his siblings until his teens. In 1863 he was sent to Rossall School in Lancashire. The drawing master there was William Coulter of the Royal Hibernian Academy. He left Rossall School in 1865, and in 1867 enrolled as a probationer at the Royal Academy Schools. On 8 January 1868 he was admitted as a student there - which was incidentally a professional path taken against his parents' wishes.
Career
Whall moved to Edmonton to live with his mother after his father's death in 1874. He had hoped to find work as a portrait painter, but was offered few commissions. In 1874 Whall met the designer, A. H. Mackmurdo, founder of the Century Guild, and through him Selwyn Image, and contributed to the Guild's publication, Hobby Horse. In 1875 and 1876 he exhibited at the Royal Academy. At this time he gained the patronage of a Hanoverian, Baroness von Boselager, who gave him funds to travel to Italy, where he was to stay for almost three years, travelling in central and northern Italy, studying architecture and paintings. In 1878 in Lucca he converted to Catholicism. Before going to Italy he had sought work as a portrait painter and as a studio assistant to other artists, but had had little success.
When he returned to London in 1879, almost penniless, he was befriended by the Rosminian Order of Charity at St Ethelreda's Church in Ely Place, Holborn and became a lay member of that Order. At St Ethelreda's he designed the side windows in the upper chapel, these windows being made by W.G. Saunders. By 1882 he was to leave the religious community at Ely Place, move to No.18 Wharton Street in Clerkenwell and work as an illustrator of newspapers, novels and children's books, as well as assisting other painters and giving drawing lessons. He carried out designs during this period for several stained glass makers including John Hardman Trading Co. Ltd as well as James Powell and Sons.
Early Arts and Crafts Movement
Whall's career as an independent designer and maker of stained glass began in the late 1880s. This coincided with the emergence of the Arts and Crafts Movement through bodies such as the Art Workers' Guild and the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. Whall was actively involved in these two organizations for thirty years and was an influential spokesman for the medium of stained glass. In 1912, Whall was elected to the role of Master of the Art Worker's Guild.
Indeed, through James Powell and Sons he was to exhibit at that Society's exhibitions at the New Gallery in 1888 and 1889. The architects with whom he was to work at Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Street, John Dando Sedding and Henry Wilson were also prominent within the Movement. It was John Dando Sedding who was to give Whall his first independent commission, for the Lady Chapel East window of St Mary's church in Stamford, Lincolnshire, which he completed in 1891.
Whall's participation in the early activities of the Arts and Crafts Movement came soon after a life-changing event that had taken place in 1887. In that year he had converted the cow-shed at his cottage in Dorking into a workshop, where he set about learning all the processes of the craft: cutting, painting, firing and glazing, so that, in future, no part of the making of his windows would be beyond his control. This was a direct protest against the division of labour, then almost universally prevalent among commercial manufacturers, which Whall and others saw as incompatible with the production of stained glass as an art rather than simply a trade. During his time at Dorking, Whall was assisted by Louis Davis and Reginald Hallward, both of whom were to have distinguished careers as stained glass artists.
Whall's artistic style included using images from nature, a wide range of glass colours and textures, and new glass materials. Whall's application of white glass for his windows was unique for the time period. He was one of the earliest Arts and Crafts Movement stained glass artists to include slab glass in his work. Whall's work was considered groundbreaking in his use of Prior's "Early English" glass. The east window he created for St. Mary's Stamford was the first large stained glass window to contain the new material.
Stained glass work and teaching
For the decade after the Whalls left Dorking in 1896 he had no premises of his own for firing and glazing his stained glass, and during this period he worked closely with the firm of Lowndes and Drury and it was in their workshops that all his windows were fabricated between 1897 and 1906 (either at Park Walk in Chelsea or at Lettice Street). Lowndes and Drury was founded in 1897 by the artist Mary Lowndes, and Alfred John Drury with the aim of providing independent designer-craft workers with the necessary facilities to carry out their stained glass commissions.
At various times, particularly in the 1880s and 1890s, Whall was commissioned to design windows by James Powell and Sons. During this time period, Whall created stained glass windows for churches in London, throughout England, and Wales. (See List of works by Christopher Whall)
Central School of Art and Crafts
The Central School of Art and Crafts was founded by the London County Council in 1896. Whall was hired by the school's directors, George Frampton and William Lethaby, to be among the eleven teachers at the school. He taught the craft of stained glass. Students taking Whall's class were a wide assortment of ages, backgrounds and level of experience. During the first school year, Whall taught his classes alone, but by 1897 he had hired Alfred Drury, an experienced glazer to teach the crafts of leading and glazing. Whall's method of teaching, which he called the "Ruskin method", taught students to combine close observations and detailed workmanship along with more traditional artistic skills. He encouraged students by giving them small tasks to perfect before working up to large, more complex work. Whall was a gifted communicator and a popular teacher.
Whall resigned from his teaching position in 1905, but continued to work with the stained glass classes in an informal supervisory role. His successor at the school was Karl Parsons, former student and studio—assistant, and a strong follower of Whall's teachings.
Royal College of Art
Whall also taught at the Royal College of Art, informally from 1897, with the assistance of Alfred Drury to a formal teaching position at the school in 1901. A kiln was not available during Whall's time at the school, and the firing of students' glass painting was done at Lowndes and Drury studio. Whall taught at the school until 1909.
Stained glass manual
Whall's experienced his work as a stained glass artist and teacher as a vocation. While an instructor at the Central School of Art and Crafts, Whall was encouraged by school director, William Lethaby to write an instructional book about his craft. The book, Stained Glass Work, was published in London by John Hogg in 1905. Whall's manual, was part of a series of books, which included the following manuals: lettering by Edward Johnston, silverwork by Henry Wilson, bookbinding by Douglas Cockerell and wood-carving by George Jack. This series has been almost in continuous print since the early 1900s, and continues to be influential today.
The move to Ravenscourt Park
In 1907, Whall decided to establish his own studio-workshop and took over the building at 1 Ravenscourt Park, Hammersmith. The site, was formerly used by his friend Charles Spooner, the architect, as a furniture making workshop. Whall hired Spooner to convert the upper floor and attic into a large studio with several large windows for cartooning and glass-painting, and the ground floor into a glazing workshop and kiln room. The building was used by Whall and his apprentices during 1907-1908, but the conversion was not fully completed until 1909. Whall's studio included innovative labor-saving devices, including "an improved tray for loading painted glass into the kiln and an easily movable glass-painting easel".
Whall's studio-workshops were always collaborative in nature. Whall fostered an environment where experimenting and continually learning was key, even for the instructor. He stocked the workshop with plants, insects, and items from nature for inspiration for colour and design. A Greater London Council blue plaque on the Ravenscourt Park house commemorates his life there.
Later career and death
By the early 1920s, Whall was suffering from the early stages of leukemia. He handed over the management of his studio to stained glass designer and former pupil, Edward Woore. Despite his illness, Whall continued to design and do some glass-painting, using a specially constructed adjustable chair.
In 1922, at the age of 73, Whall created the firm of Whall & Whall LImited, naming himself and his daughter Veronica as co-directors. She was a skilled stained glass artist and craftsman and created a number of stained glass works under the firm's name.
Whall's health continued to decline and he died on 23 December 1924, at the age of 75. Whall & Whall, under the management of Veronica Whall continued on long after her father's death.
Artists influenced by Whall
Although there is no record of Whall having undertaken commissions in Ireland, except for Loughrea Cathedral, it does seem that he can be linked to the early 20th century stained glass revival in that country. The artist Wilhelmina Geddes was certainly influenced by Whall. Geddes was the artist who created the work "The Crucifixion" in St Luke's Church in Wallsend.
It was in September 1901 that Alfred E. Child arrived in Dublin to take up the post of Instructor in Stained Glass at the newly reorganised Dublin Metropolitan School of Art and it seems that Whall was one of those who were behind this appointment along with the painter Sarah Purser, the poet W. B. Yeats and Edward Martyn the art critic. Child had been trained by Whall and would try to bring Whall's principles to a new generation of Irish artists. Child and his artist friends aimed to set up a workshop similar to that formed by Mary Lowndes and Alfred Drury in London and in 1903 Sarah Purser set up "The Tower of Glass" (in Gaelic "An Túr Gloine").
Somewhat further afield, it was Ralph Adams Cram, the architect, who introduced Whall's work to the United States in the period 1906-1910, this at All Saints Ashmont, Boston and Boston's Church of the Advent. For the Church of the Advent, Whall completed five windows depicting the five regions of the early church, starting with the first window on the East end of the South Nave wall with St. Ignatius of Antioch representing the Syrian Church and West of that St.Athanasius representing the African Church. On the North side starting at the West end is St. Ambrose of Milan for the Latin Church, then St. Chrysostom for the Greek Church and finally St. Columba, symbolising the Celtic Church.
Personal life
Whall married Florence M. Chaplin on 10 November 1884. In 1884 the family moved from London to Stonebridge, near Dorking, where they kept a small-holding with a cow, a pig and some chickens. Their five children were born between 1885 and 1894. Christopher John was born in 1885 and their daughter Veronica in 1887. The other children were Hew Bernard, Audrey (who died in infancy) and Louis.
In 1896, with increasing demand for work and the necessity to spend more time in London, Whall and his family moved to Eyot Cottage, Chiswick, London where they shared the residence of architect, Charles Spooner. Whall and Spooner were professional associates and good friends. They often collaborated on commissions and both shared a mutual interest in leaded glazing.
Whall's wife and children were often models for figures in his stained glass windows. They often visited the studio-workshop to view the works in process. When windows were completed, Whall would often host fellow artists, clients, friends and family in the studio for a private viewing. His wife, Florence and daughter, Veronica, would host the viewing party with tea, refreshments and music.
Whall's daughter, Veronica, was a student in his stained glass classes. She later became one of her father's studio-assistants. After his death, she took over management of his studio-workshop. She was a skilled artist and had a successful career as a stained glass artist.

In Māori mythology, Matuku-tangotango (Matuku) is an ogre who kills Wahieroa the son of Tāwhaki. In some versions, Matuku lives in a cave called Putawarenuku. Rātā, the son of Wahieroa, sets off to avenge his murdered father, and arrives at last at Matuku's village. He hears from Matuku's servant that at the new moon his master can be killed at the pool where he washes his face and hair. When the new moon has come, Rātā waits until the ogre comes out of his cave and is leaning over with his head in the pool. He grabs him by the hair and kills him. Rātā then sets off to rescue his father's bones from the Ponaturi. A South Island version names the islands where Matuku lives as Puorunuku and Puororangi and also states that Rātā nooses Matuku as he comes out of his lair to perform certain rituals (Tregear 1891:232, 399-400).

Lower Dniester National Nature Park () covers a large portion of the Dniester River Estuary where it enters the Black Sea in southwestern Ukraine. The floodplains and waterways are important to nesting and wintering waterfowl. They are also important for spawning fish: over 70 species of fish in 20 groups are recorded in the park. The boundaries include two Ramsar wetland sites of international importance. The park is about 30 km west of the city of Odessa, in the administrative districts of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, Bilyayivka, and Ovidiopol in Odessa Oblast.
Topography
The park covers the northern part of the Dniester Liman (estuary), including the confluence of the Dniester River and the Turunchuk River which enters from Moldova to the west. The coastal area is a freshwater lagoon, and the inland areas are permanent inland deltas and intermittent freshwater lakes. As is common with national parks in Ukraine, Lower Dniester is allocated among different zones - nature protection, regulated recreation, stationary recreation, and economic use. The southern part of the park on the Gulf of Karogol is an ichthyological reserve where fishing is prohibited.
Climate and ecoregion
The climate of Lower Dniester is Humid continental climate, warm summer (Köppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. Precipitation averages per year.
Lower Dniester National Park is located in the Pontic–Caspian steppe ecoregion, a region that covers an expanse of grasslands stretching from the northern shores of the Black Sea to western Kazakhstan.
Flora and fauna
The habitats in the park include accumulative peninsulas, reed thickets, scroll ridges, floating bogs, and islands of floodplain forest.
Up to 15,000 nesting pairs of birds have been estimated. The dominant nesting species of waterfowl are the Eurasian coot, great crested grebe, mallard, and black-headed gull.
Public use
There are four major ecotourism routes in the park: (a) "Dniester Amazon", a river route with six observation stops through the Amazon Strait (a picturesque channel in a forest) and the Turunchuk River, (b) "Brilliant Ibis", a course parallel to the first, (c) "Kingdom of the Birds", a 20-km bird-watching excursion through the shallow reaches of the estuary, and (d) "The Trail of Dad Ovsia".

Alex Moscovitch (English: Alex Moskovitch, French: Alex Moscovitch, Ukrainian: Oleksiy Oleksandrovych Moscovitch, Russian: Aleksey Aleksandrovich Moscovitch) (1911, Kyiv (Kiev) – 1996, Paris) was a French politician and analyst. He was also an associate and companion of General Charles de Gaulle.
After the Russian Civil War the Moscovitch family emigrated to France. In 1931, Moscovitch's parents returned to Kiev, where his father was executed in 1935. Moscovitch was then serving in the French Armed Forces, so he stayed in France.

City Councillor of Paris
From 1947 to 1966, Alex Moscovitch was a city councilor of Paris.
The Algerian War
During the debate in the municipal council of Paris, on the Paris massacre of 1961 (17 October 1961), Alex Moscovitch makes a remark that will be reproached to him. Anne Chemin in Le Monde, of 17 October 2011, writes: "Le 27 octobre 1961, Claude Bourdet, directeur du magazine France Observateur demande -en vain - une commission d'enquête du conseil municipal de Paris. "Ce qu'il nous faut, c'est très simple et très clair: l'autorisation et suffisamment de bateaux (pour y mettre les Algériens), répond le conseiller Alex Moscovitch. Le problème qui consisterait à faire couler ces bateaux ne relève pas, hélas, du conseil municipal de Paris."
("The weaker, they finished them until death" .The circumstances of the death of a hundred Algerian demonstrators killed by the police on October 17, 1961, in Paris, have long been overshadowed: "On October 27, 1961, Claude Bourdet, director of the magazine France Observateur, asked in vain for a commission of inquiry from the Paris municipal council. What we need is very simple and clear: the authorization and enough boats (to put the Algerians there), "replied Councilor Alex Moscovitch. The problem of sinking these boats is not, alas, the responsibility of the municipal council of Paris.")
Important dates in life and work
1940-1945 - officer of the troops of "Free France" (anti-Nazi movement) Free French Forces (French: France Libre and Forces françaises libres), organized and led by Charles de Gaulle.

The Deutsches Museum (German Museum, officially (English: German Museum of Masterpieces of Science and Technology)) in Munich, Germany, is the world's largest museum of science and technology, with about 28,000 exhibited objects from 50 fields of science and technology. It receives about 1.5 million visitors per year.
The museum was founded on 28 June 1903, at a meeting of the Association of German Engineers (VDI) as an initiative of Oskar von Miller. It is the largest museum in Munich. For a period of time the museum was also used to host pop and rock concerts including The Who, Jimi Hendrix and Elton John.
Museumsinsel
The main site of the Deutsches Museum is a small island in the Isar river, which had been used for rafting wood since the Middle Ages. The island did not have any buildings before 1772 because it was regularly flooded prior to the building of the Sylvensteinspeicher.
In 1772 the Isar barracks were built on the island and, after the flooding of 1899, the buildings were rebuilt with flood protection. In 1903 the city council announced that they would donate the island for the newly built Deutsches Museum. The island formerly known as Kohleninsel (coal island) was then renamed Museumsinsel.
Other sites
In addition to the main site on the Museumsinsel, the museum has two branches in and near Munich, one in Bonn, and one in Nuremberg.
The Flugwerft Schleißheim branch is located some 18 kilometres north of Munich's city centre close to Schleißheim Palace. It is based on the premises of one of the first military airbases in Germany founded just before World War I. It comprises the old air control and command centre as well as modern buildings added in the late 2000s after strong endorsement from Franz Josef Strauss, former prime minister of the state of Bavaria (1978 to 1988), who was a passionate flyer.
The Flugwerft Schleißheim displays various interesting airplanes for which there was insufficient room at the Museumsinsel site in downtown Munich. Among the more prominent exhibits is a Horten flying wing glider built in the 1940s, restored from the few surviving parts. A collection of the German constructions of VTOL (vertical take off and landing) planes developed in the 1950s and 1960s is unique. A range of Vietnam era fighter planes as well as Russian planes taken over from East Germany after the reunification are on display. This outstation also features a workshop dedicated to the restoration of all types of airplanes intended for static display.
In 2003 the Deutsches Museum Verkehrzentrum was opened. Located at Theresienhöhe in Munich it focuses on transportation technology.
The branch located in Bonn was opened in 1995 and focuses on German technology, science and research after 1945.
The latest opening of a branch was the Deutsches Museum Nuremberg - "Das Zukunftsmuseum", in September of 2021. It focuses on future technology and its impact on humans and society.
Oskar von Miller
Oskar von Miller studied electrical engineering and is otherwise known for building the first high voltage line from Miesbach to Munich (57 km) in 1882 for the electrical technology exhibition at the Glaspalast in Munich. In 1883 he joined AEG and founded an engineering office in Munich. The Frankfurt electricity exhibition in 1891 and several power plants contributed to the reputation of Oskar von Miller. In the early years, the exhibition and the collection of the Deutsches Museum were strongly influenced personally by Oskar von Miller.
History
A few months before the 1903 meeting of the Society of German Engineers, Oskar von Miller gathered a small group who supported his desire to found a science and technology museum. In a showing of support this group spontaneously donated 260,000 marks to the cause and elected a "Provisional Committee" to get the ball rolling.
In June 1903, Prince Ludwig agreed to act as patron of the museum and the city of Munich donated Coal Island as a site for the project. In addition, exhibits began to arrive from Munich, Germany, and abroad including collections from the Bavarian Academy. As no dedicated museum building existed, the exhibits were displayed in the National Museum.
On 12 November 1906, the temporary exhibits at the National Museum were ceremonially opened to the public and on November 13 the foundation stone was laid for the permanent museum.
The first name of the museum, the "German Museum for Masterpieces of Natural Science and Technology", was not meant to limit the museum to German advances in science and technology, but to express the importance of science and technology to the German people.
Oskar von Miller opened the new museum on his 70th birthday, 2 May 1925, after a delay of almost ten years. From the beginning, the museum displays are backed up by documents available in a public library and archives, which are open seven days a week to ensure access to the working public.
Before and during World War II the museum was put on a shoestring budget by the Nazi party and many exhibits were allowed to get out of date with a few exceptions such as the new automobile room dedicated 7 May 1937. By the end of 1944 the museum was badly damaged by air bombings with 80% of the buildings and 20% of the exhibits damaged or destroyed. As Allied troops marched into Munich in April 1945, museum director, Karl Bässler, barely managed to keep the last standing bridge to Museum Island from being blown up by retreating German troops.
Following the war the museum had to be closed for repairs and temporary tenants, such as the College of Technology and the Post Office used museum space as their own buildings were being reconstructed. The Museum was also home to the Central Committee of the Liberated Jews, representing Jewish displaced persons in the American Zone of Germany after the war, as well as to UNRRA that operated a camp for displaced persons and later an International University with over 2000 students.
In November 1945, the library was able to reopen, followed by the congress hall in January 1946. A special exhibit on fifty years of the Diesel engine opened in October 1947 and the regular exhibits began reopening in May 1948. Not until 1965, more than twenty years after the end of the war in Germany, did the exhibit area match (and then exceed) pre-war size.
During the 1950s, the museum focused on natural sciences rather than technology and many of the traditional large exhibits, such as civil engineering, were reduced in size to make way for more modern technological advances.
At a speech on the donation of a Opel RAK2 rocket-car replica to the Deutsches Museum, rocket pioneer Fritz von Opel summarized the history of rocketry ("Ein Pionier des Raketenantriebs berichtet", April 3, 1968) beginning with ancient rocket technologies over the world's first rocket program Opel RAK, initiated by Max Valier, Friedrich Wilhelm Sander and himself, to NASA's space missions of the 1960s. In August 1969, the Apollo 8 space capsule was shown in a special exhibit entitled "Man and Space" and in 1970 the first full-time director, Theo Stillger, was appointed. In the 1970s the mission statement of the museum was modified to encourage the explanation of the cultural significance of science and technology in exhibits.
The early 1980s saw severe damage to several exhibits due to arson resulting in the smallest exhibit space of 34,140 square meters. This was followed by an extensive reconstruction effort and additional building bringing the total exhibit space to 55,000 square meters by 1993. The 1980s and '90s also brought agreements with the Science Centre in Bonn and the government resulting in the creation of Deutsches Museum Bonn and the Flugwerft Schleißheim airfield exhibit.
In 1996, the Bavarian Government gave buildings at the historic Theresienhöhe site in Munich to the Deutsches Museum resulting in the creation of the new transportation museum, the Deutsches Museum Verkehrszentrum, which opened in 2003 and now houses the road vehicle and train exhibits that were removed from the original Deutsches Museum site. The Theresienhöhe quarter is a new area on the edge of the inner city of Munich, and the Museum of Transport is a part of the quarter's design of mixed use.

Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya is a Buddhist girls' school in Kalutara, Sri Lanka. It was founded in 1942 by Sir Cyril De Zoysa. It became a national school on 9 March 1998.
Overview
Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya, as per the Education Ministry classification, is an IAB category National school. An IAB category school has classes from Grade 1 (or at least Grade 5) up to Grade 13. It must also have an Advanced Level Science stream. A National school is managed by the Ministry of Education, as opposed to Provincial schools, which are managed by provincial authorities. Being a government school, Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya follows government educational policy.
Administration
With over 3,000 students, 112 teachers and another 10 supportive staff, Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya has decentralised administrative requirements for smooth management. The Principal, with assistance from the Vice-Principal, manages the entire school through delegation of powers to different sectional heads – A Deputy Principal for the Primary (Grade 1 – 5) section, a Deputy Principal for the Middle-school (Grade 6 – 9), an Assistant Principal for Grade 10 and 11, and another Deputy Principal for Grade 12 and 13. Assistant Principals are also appointed to handle other specific areas – namely: Co-curricular activities, finance, infrastructure and academic affairs.
Admission
Admission of students to Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya is at 3 levels. Nearly 200 children are selected for admission at the Grade 1 level. Selections to be made strictly in terms of circular issued by the Ministry of Education.
The next level of admission is at Grade 6. About 25 Sinhala medium students are selected on the basis of the year 5 Bursaries and Placement Examination. Students hail from all corners of the island; hence it is the schools responsibility to provide accommodation for at least some of them.
The third and final level of admission is at Grade 12. A small number of students are admitted depending on the number of vacancies based on their O Level results, sports and other achievements. Priority is also given to students who do not have A Level facilities in their current schools.
Infrastructure
Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya boasts of an impressive infrastructure spanning over . In addition to several long standing structural features, several new buildings have been added to the Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya list of facilities. A complete Information Technology Centre is the latest integral in the balika facilities of two science laboratories, auditorium and the like. Several new buildings have merged into the distinctively impressive architectural skyline of the Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya.

The Department of Infrastructure (DOI) was a department of the Government of Victoria, Australia. Created in significant changes to the public service enacted by Jeff Kennett after he was returned as Premier of Victoria at the 1996 state election, the DOI oversaw a variety of functions until its abolition in 2008. It was responsible for transport policy during its entire existence, and consequently played a major role in the related reforms and projects initiated by Kennett and his successors. At different times, it also had responsibility for planning, major projects, local government, energy, communications, and mining.
Kennett government
The Department was created in machinery of government changes following the re-election of the Kennett government in 1996. As well as absorbing all the functions of the Department of Planning and Development and the Department of Transport, the DOI also assumed responsibility for local government.
The Kennett government's program of major transport reforms, which included privatisation of the public transport network, a new partially-automated ticketing system, and construction of Melbourne's first privately-owned toll road, caused significant tension between the DOI and the Transport Reform Unit (TRU) within the Department of Treasury and Finance. DOI staff expressed concerns that the TRU was effectively running the state's transport network and delegating only minor operational concerns to the DOI and its agencies.
The model adopted by the TRU for the transport privatisation saw the Public Transport Corporation divided into five corporate business units: two each covering the metropolitan tram and train networks, and one for the V/Line country passenger and freight businesses. The metropolitan operations were transferred to private control by a franchise arrangement with the state retaining ownership of the assets. Although the TRU had intended a similar approach for V/Line, it altered the arrangements under pressure from potential bidders by vertically and horizontally disaggregating the system, and sold the freight operations and non-fixed assets outright with a long-term lease on the track and infrastructure to the Freight Victoria consortium, while franchising the passenger operations separately. The residual functions of the PTC, including monitoring of the contracts, were transferred to the Director of Public Transport, a new statutory office within the DOI.
The Office of Local Government was merged into the Strategic Planning unit of the DOI late in 1998 following complaints from municipal councils that the state government's negotiations with them had been "patronising". The head of the Office was also removed from his role, although the DOI secretary denied the change was a demotion.
Bracks and Brumby governments
During the campaign for the 1999 state election, opposition leader Steve Bracks said he would merge the DOI with the Department of State Development to create a Department of State and Regional Development. Following the election of the Bracks government, however, the merger did not take place, although Bracks immediately removed Kennett's DOI secretary; the Department of State Development was renamed as Bracks had promised but without substantial change to its functions. When it was abolished in March 2002, its major projects responsibility was transferred to the DOI.
The DOI played a major role in delivery of the Bracks' government's transport projects, such as the Regional Fast Rail project (RFR), and redevelopment of Spencer Street railway station. Because privatisation had left the DOI with little experience of major project procurement, it allowed companies tendering for the RFR works packages considerable freedom in determining how to meet travel time targets set by the state government, and used the expertise of external consultants to assess the suitability of bids. The DOI and its Rail Projects group were later heavily criticised for this approach, both for the costs of employing external consultants and for engineering solutions which proved to be poorly understood.
The Victorian Ombudsman began a major investigation into DOI staff and processes in 2002 after a series of requests for documents made by the Opposition and journalists under freedom of information laws were delayed or denied. Ministerial advisers and senior officers of the Department overturn previously approved releases of information. Several DOI projects commenced under the Bracks government were criticised by the Auditor-General in a 2004 report, which found the Department had planned and managed them poorly, leading to significant cost blowouts.
Although the Bracks government had come to power in 1999 promising significant public transport investment, the structure of the DOI continued to reflect an ingrained dependence on roads in the transport portfolio. VicRoads, although nominally under the control of the Department, was the only transport agency reporting directly to the minister, and the road corporation also maintained significant informal influence at all levels of government. The Director of Public Transport, on the other hand, sat deep within the DOI, with little power to advocate for major projects or carry out long-term planning. By 2005, transport experts had begun to call for reform of the DOI to bring public transport onto a "more even footing" with road construction. In contrast to the original aims of the DOI, land use planning had also been transferred to the Department of Sustainability and Environment, leaving the transport systems isolated from urban structure planning.
After the 2006 state election, energy policy was transferred from the DOI to the Department of Primary Industries.
In 2007, after a significant rise in metropolitan rail patronage went unmatched by service increases, the Department's complex structure without obvious accountability for public transport was again criticised. Moreover, transport experts argued a "negative and defeatist culture" within the bureaucracy was preventing it from being able to plan and deliver even simple projects.
On 28 April 2008, Premier John Brumby announced the DOI would be abolished, with its transport functions taken over by a new Department of Transport and its major project function transferred to the Department of Innovation, Industry and Regional Development.

Translator
History
KETX was initially proposed by Harold J. Haley Sr., Robert M. Sutton, & Donald L. Gulihur, under the corporate name of Polk County Broadcasting Company in September 1956. Originally intended to operate at 1220 kHz @ 250 watts, the proposal was amended in November 1956 to move up the dial to the current 1440 kHz, operating at 1 kilowatt of power. A construction permit to build the 1 kilowatt facility, located 0.8 miles NNE of Livingston was granted on April 17, 1957.
The facility was constructed by Don Gulihur, who served as the facility's Chief Engineer, utilizing a Gates BC 1J transmitter, with the studios and tower co-located at the transmission site on U.S. Highway 59, receiving a License to Cover from the Federal Communications Commission on August 23, 1957.
Polk County Broadcasting would go on to further increase power to the current 5 kilowatt daytime signal, which was licensed on May 7, 1963, and involved a change of the transmitter to an RCA BTA 1MX driver and MS 363 amplifier.
The Haley family would own the heritage KETX for the next half century, operating the facility as a country formatted station for the majority of its life, until it was sold to Livingston Telephone, d.b.a. Telcom Supply, Inc. on October 8, 2008, after the deaths of both Hal Sr. & wife Peggy Haley. KETX is one of the few remaining stations operating in Texas that has been locally owned and operated throughout its existence as a broadcast station.

James Rodney Winter Sykes (born May 19, 1929) is a Canadian politician from Alberta. He served as the 30th Mayor of Calgary from 1969 to 1977 and as leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party from 1980 to 1982. He ran as a Liberal candidate in the 1984 federal election.
Early life
Sykes was born in May 19, 1929 in Montreal, Quebec, to Leslie Sykes an electrical engineer, and Muriel, a stay-at-home mother. The Sykes family moved shortly after his birth to Sooke, British Columbia. Sykes father was largely absent from the home, working out of the community, and Sykes did not attend a formal school until the family moved to Kent at the age of 8 in 1937. Instead Sykes learned to read and write from his mother. The Sykes family returned to Victoria, British Columbia a year later after the death of his grandfather James Sykes to live in his inherited home.
After returning to Victoria, Sykes father enlisted in the Canadian Scottish Reserves and served overseas for six years in the Second World War. The family faced financial insecurity, and his mother spent time in a nursing home due to mental health issues, while Sykes and his sister were put into foster care. Sykes lashed out during his time at school and was often in trouble. Sykes later attended Oak Bay High School, which he saw as a turning point in his life, and was able to catch up with his education in what he described as a positive environment. Sykes also credits T.W.S. Parsons, the Commissioner of the British Columbia Provincial Police, and father of a school friend for being a positive father figure in his formative years.
Sykes father returned from the Second World War when he was 17, and Rod soon moved out of the family home due to animosity with his father. Sykes considered a career in law, but attended Sprott Shaw College to take classes in business, and began working in an apprenticeship at a small accounting firm. At 19, Sykes reported the principal of the firm to the Institute of Chartered Accountants after he was forced to present falsified figures for a client to a bank, the Institute arranged for Sykes to continue his career at Price Waterhouse. With Price Waterhouse, Sykes lived in Montreal for 8 years from 1954–1962, and in Zürich, Switzerland for a short period of time.
After becoming a Chartered accountant, Sykes attended Sir George Williams University in Montreal, studying economics.
Canadian Pacific Railway and Calgary
Sykes joined Canadian Pacific Railway as the Supervisor of Economic Projects in 1959 at the invitation of Ian David Sinclair. His role was to better utilize the CPR's non-transportation assets such as oil, gas, forestry, real estate, chemicals and metal holdings. Sykes spent much of his time traveling between his home in Montreal and Calgary, where the CPR was considering move tracks out of the city's downtown and use the land for real estate development. Sykes moved to Calgary in 1962 as the CPR's Project Manager for the Calgary land use study.
In Calgary, Sykes established and ran the CPR's real estate arm Marathon Realty, which Sykes named after the short story The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner. The planned relocation of the CPR tracks was a joint project between the city and the railway, and early on Sykes had a strong relationship with Mayor Harry Hays. When Hays quit municipal politics to run federally in 1963, he was replaced with Grant MacEwan for two years, whom Sykes had a challenging relationship with. While Hays had strongly supported the redevelopment, MacEwan believed the final decision should be sent to the residents of Calgary.
Political career
Sykes served as mayor of Calgary from 1969 to 1977. He was defender of the underdog and the importance of financial safety nets for the needy, attacked corruption among the rich and powerful, and left office after ensuring Calgary would begin on LRT construction. During his time as mayor, Calgary switched from the pro-rep (STV) system to plurality election in single-member wards.
Sykes was leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party from 1980 to 1982. He quit as party leader in 1982, frustrated by the party's internal and financial problems.
In 1984, he was nominated by Alan Clarke, Calgary East Federal Liberal Riding Association Vice President, to run for the Liberal Party for a seat in the House of Commons, in the riding of Calgary East. At the time this was the largest riding in Canada.
Sykes was acclaimed at a nomination meeting with over six-hundred members in attendance. Despite being the only Liberal candidate endorsed by the Calgary Sun that year, he lost to Progressive Conservative Alex Kindy in the general election.
Personal life
He and his wife Gisèle (Deceased) have five children and fourteen grandchildren. He also has a sister, Anne, who lives in Victoria.
At an early age Sykes took an interest in gardening, reading, and stamp collecting, and remained a member of the American Philatelic Society throughout his life. Through his interest in reading, the British Royal family, and political history, Sykes became friends with Lord Mountbatten, which allowed Sykes access to some major events during his life.
Sykes was raised as a Christian in the Church of England, but later converted to Catholicism in his mid-20s.
Sykes was a long-time friend of professional wrestler and promoter Stu Hart.

For the Love of a Man is a 2015 Indian documentary film directed by Rinku Kalsy. The film explores the fan following of film actor Rajinikanth.
Synopsis
For the Love of a Man begins with coverage of fan activities during the releases of Rajinikanth's blockbuster films. It then proceeds to explain the historical and political context of fandom in Tamil Nadu through the stories of four fans: Kamal Anand, a mimicry artist, G. Mani, a gangster turned peanut-seller, and Murugan and Ravi, two sweetshop owners from Sholinghur.
Reception
The film premiered at the 71st Venice International Film Festival. The Venice review expressed mixed feelings about the absence of Rajinikanth in the film. The Hollywood Reporter review likewise critiqued the film for the absence of the star from the film, but praised the film for providing a "jaw-dropping, intro to the extremes of actor-worship." The film was also shown at the Dubai International Film Festival and at the Mumbai International Film Festival, where it was cited as among the top documentaries of 2015.

The Shrine of Ibrahim, known locally as Lal Shahbaz Dargah, was built around 1160 in Bhadresar in Kutch district, Gujarat, India. It is one of the earliers extant Islamic monuments in India. The shrine is mistakenly attributed to Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, whose shrine is instead located in Pakistan.
Shrine
The shrine, in a small walled enclosure, has a square pyramid shaped dome, round in the inside and supported on eight pillars set against the wall. The roof of the porch is flat is divided in 9×3 small squares, each with lotus flowers inside. Round the architrave, above the vine-ornamented wall-head course, there is a deep line of Arab inscription in large square Kufic characters, and on the right-end of the wall there are two lines of inscription. In the court some graves also have Kufic inscriptions. This epigraph constructed in 1160 marked the first use of Kufic script in India. According to an inscription in the monument, it is a shrine to Ibrahim.

Tai O is a fishing town, partly located on an island of the same name, on the western side of Lantau Island in Hong Kong. The village name means large inlet, referring to outlet for the waterways (Tai O Creek and Tai O River) merges as it moves through Tai O.
Geography
On the southwest part of Lantau Island, Tai O River splits to the north (as Tai O Creek) and west and at this fork lies the island referred to as Tai O. Two pedestrian bridges cross the river on its northern and western forks. The village is located mostly on the banks of the river. The western and northern parts of the island facing the South China Sea are uninhabited.
History
Nearby archaeological sites date back to the Stone Age, but permanent, and verifiable, human settlement here is only three centuries old. Stories that would be impossible to substantiate have Tai O as the base of many smuggling and piracy operations, the inlets of the river providing excellent protection from the weather and a hiding place. In early 16th century, Tai O was once occupied shortly by Portuguese during the Battle of Tamão, the remains is known as Fan Kwai Tong (番鬼塘, "Foreign devil pond") today. At nearby Fan Lau, a fort was built in 1729 to protect shipping on the Pearl River. Smuggling of guns, tobacco, drugs and people remains a documented illegal activity both into and out of mainland China.
When the British came to Hong Kong, Tai O was known as a Tanka village. A naval engagement between British and USA naval forces against Chinese piracy was fought in 1855.
At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Shek Tsai Po of Tai O was 118; the number of males was 71. The population of Tai O, both land and boat based, was 7,661; the number of males was 4,318.
During and after the Chinese Civil War, Tai O became a primary entrypoint for illegal immigration for those escaping from the People's Republic of China. Some of these immigrants, mostly Cantonese, stayed in Tai O, and Tai O attracted people from other Hong Kong ethnic groups, including Hoklo (Hokkien) and Hakka.
Tai O has a history of salt production. In 1940, it was recorded that the Tai O salt marshes were covering and that the production has amounted to 25,000 piculs (1,512 metric tons) in 1938.
Currently the fishing lifestyle is dying out. While many residents continue to fish, it barely provides a subsistence income. There is a public school on the island and most young people move away when they come of age. In 2000, a large fire broke out destroying many residences. The village is now mostly squatters huts and dilapidated stilt houses.

Tourism
Also known as the "Venice of Hong Kong", Tai O is a tourist spot for both foreigners and residents of other parts of Hong Kong, despite damage by a fire in July 2000. The pang uks, a kind of stilt house, built right over the waterway are still quite scenic. A cable ferry tended by local women used to be quite popular with visitors, but it was replaced with a steel pedestrian bridge in October 1996.
The traditional salted fish and shrimp paste are sold at storefronts in Tai O. For a small fee, some residents will take tourists out on their boats along the river and for short jaunts into the sea. Many tourists come to Tai O specifically to take these trips to see Chinese white dolphins, also known as "Pink Dolphins". It is also a good place to see the sunset.
Old Tai O Police Station, a Grade II historic building, has been turned into a boutique hotel called Tai O Heritage Hotel by Hong Kong Heritage Conservation Foundation. The hotel has nine rooms and a restaurant. The hotel has been open and operational since 2012.
Tai O Rural Committee Historic and Cultural Showroom, located within the centuries-old fishing village of Tai O, exhibits relics of the local community's past, including fishing tools and dismantled old structures. The showroom was founded by the Tai O Rural Committee and all the items in its collection were donated by local residents.
Education
There are two kindergartens, one primary school and one secondary school. They are CCC Tai O Primary School and Buddhist Fat Ho Memorial College.

Kampp 161 is an ancient Egyptian tomb located in the Dra' Abu el-Naga' necropolis in Thebes, one of Egypt's ancient capitals. If compared with similar tombs in the region based on style and architecture, it would probably date back to the reigns of Amenhotep II or Thutmose IV of the Eighteenth Dynasty.
History of archaeological work
The tomb is known at least since the 1990s. It was registered as "Kampp 161" by Friederike Kampp-Seyfried during her survey in the years 1988/89. The tomb was heavily buried under debris at that time, so only a few features were visible like the open courtyard with a surrounding wall built from limestone blocks. According to her the tomb is to be dated to the 18th Dynasty, maybe to the reign of Thutmosis III.
On December 9, 2017, the Ministry of State of Antiquities announced that the tomb, along with Kampp 150, was cleared from debris by a team of Egyptian archeologists.
Wall decorations
A colourful but not entirely finished mural depicting an individual presenting offerings to the deceased owner of the tomb and probably his wife at a banquet with family members and friends was found on the western wall of the tomb.
Finds
A decorated coffin and wooden funerary masks were also found.

Henk Houwaart (born August 31, 1945) is a Dutch football manager and a former football player.
Born in the Hague, Houwaart began his career in 1963 as a footballer playing for ADO Den Haag until 1967, when he left the club to play for FC Twente. After being selected once for the Dutch national team, he continued his career in 1969 in Belgium to play for Club Brugge K.V. and in his first season his team won the Belgian Cup and the championship in 1973. He was transferred to Royal Antwerp F.C. in 1975 but six months later, he sustained an injury in a UEFA Cup match against Śląsk Wrocław that ended his career.
Coaching career
However, he did not stop his football career and began to work as a trainer. Beginning his career as a trainer of K.S.V. Roeselare in 1977, the following season he became trainer of Eendracht Aalst. K.V. Kortrijk was his next club in 1979 and after finishing second in Belgian Second Division his team promoted to First Division.
In 1983, he moved to Cercle Brugge K.S.V.; however, Houwaart's aim was to become trainer of Club Brugge and one year later he moved there. He won his first trophies with this club, the Belgian Cup in 1986 and the Belgian Supercup the same year. He also won his first Championship as a coach in the 1987–88 season and the same season his team played in UEFA Cup and reached the semi-finals, when they were eliminated by RCD Espanyol in extra time.
He was fired in 1989 after bad results and he returned to his former club K.V. Kortrijk. He then moved to Greece to be the coach of AO Xanthi. After one year in Greece, he returned to Belgium and returned for two years to Cercle Brugge until 1993. His next team was K.R.C. Harelbeke, and he helped them to promote to the first division. He stayed there six years, from 1994 until 2000. After six years coaching K.R.C. Harelbeke, he went to K.A.A. Gent, but few months after, he was fired after a home defeat of the team in UEFA Cup by AFC Ajax.
For the second time in his career he left Belgium, this time he moved to Cyprus in November 2000 and became coach of Omonia Nicosia. Despite that Omonia was the most successful team in Cyprus, they had not won the Cypriot First Division in eight years. Omonia were seven points behind Anorthosis Famagusta, who were champions the previous four years and another year seemed lost for Omonia. After Houwaart's departure, Omonia performance changed rapidly and they won the championship after 8 years and a few months later they won the Cyprus Super Cup. After a bad beginning in the 2001–02 season, Houwaart quit as coach and went back to Belgium and to Royal Antwerp for the remaining season. He coached Sporting West Ingelmunster-Harelbeke in 2002–03.
He moved to Cyprus again, this time for AEL Limassol during the middle of the season 2003–04. Since the day he began coaching AEL Limassol, his team was unbeaten and reached the Cypriot Cup final. The unbeaten record ended in that final against AEK Larnaca, when his team lost 2–1. Six months later, he returned to his first Cypriot team, AC Omonia and won the Cypriot Cup after beating Digenis Morphou in the final 2–0. A few months later, they won the Cyprus Super Cup again. In the Super Cup, Omonia beat Anorthosis Famagusta 5–4 on penal ties after a 2–2 result. The 2005–06, Omonia was contenter for the Championship title, however the team performed badly and he resigned again from Omonia. Since then, he moved to Sint-Truidense V.V. in February 2006, where he saved them from relegation. He is now Head Coach from Belgian lower division team Royal Knokke F.C.

Ramat HaNegev Regional Council (, Mo'atza Azorit Ramat HaNegev, lit. Negev Heights Regional Council) is a regional council in the Negev desert in Israel. With around 8,000 residents spread across 20 villages, the council is geographically the largest in Israel, covering more than 20% of Israel's landmass. The council's headquarters are located on Highway 40 between Mashabei Sadeh and Tlalim.
Geography
Ramat HaNegev is geographically the largest local authority area in Israel, covering over 4.3 million dunam, around 22% of Israel. The region is home to around 8,000 residents spread across 20 villages split between kibbutzim, moshavim, community settlements, an educational youth village and military bases, as well as 23 farms.
The council borders Central Arava Regional Council to the east, Hevel Eilot Regional Council to the south, Egypt to the west and Bnei Shimon Regional Council and Eshkol Regional Council to the north. Neve Midbar Regional Council and the local councils of Mitzpe Ramon and Yeruham are enclaves within Ramat HaNegev.
History
The first Zionist pioneers who established Revivim in 1943 are considered the founding fathers of the region. Revivim was initially established as an agricultural experiment to study the land and climate to improve the working methods and increase production. In November 1947, kibbutz Halutza (the name later changed to its current name, Mashabei Sadeh) was established 10 kilometers northeast of Revivim. The two communities of Revivim and Mashabei Sadeh fought together to get a water pipeline, which would become the key lifelong that enabled the future expansion of the region's communities, such as Sde Boker, established in the early 1950s. While several other attempts were made to develop new Negev communities, they were eventually abandoned since they failed to receive the necessary funding as the region was not considered suitable for settlement.
The regional council of Ramat HaNegev was established in 1954 and included four communities in the beginning; Revivim, Mashabei Sadeh, Sde Boker and Kfar Yeruham (which became an independent council in 1959).
A fresh, vigorous movement to the Negev occurred in the early 1970s and accelerated following the Camp David agreements and the return of Sinai to Egypt. With the help of a campsite for temporary housing in the Mashabim junction, the first groups of settlers were able to move to the Negev, resettle, and establish new communities; Ashalim (1979), Tlalim (1980), Retamim (1983), Ezuz (1985), Nitzanei Sinai (1986) and Kmehin (1988).
Another wave began in the early 2000s when the Or Movement began directing mixed groups of religious and secular pioneers to the Negev. Merhav Am was established in 2001, Be'er Milka in 2006, and the new community of Retamim (abandoned by its original settlers) was repopulated in 2009. In 2012 the council approved the establishment of a new community, Ramat Tziporim, to provide homes for 2,000 Azzazmeh Bedouins living in the region. Sheizaf was officially recognized in 2020 by the authorities almost ten years of its initial founding.
Tourism
Ramat HaNegev has several tourist attractions, including the ruins of cities on the incense trade route such as Avdat, Shivta (a Unesco World Heritage Site), the Nabataean city of Nitzana, and Halutza. The region also includes the makhteshim craters (Gadol, Katan and Ramon)

Psychology & Social Critique (German: Psychologie & Gesellschaftskritik; abbr. P&G) is among the few critical psychological academic journals from the 1970s that still exist. P&G is considered an unorthodox publication organ for critical psychology and as initiator of much discourse pertaining to ›lowercase c‹ critical psychology in the German speaking countries (as opposed to the ›uppercase C‹ Critical Psychology of the Berlin Klaus Holzkamp school).
History
Psychology & Social Critique was founded in 1977 as »Psychology & Society« (German: Psychologie und Gesellschaft) by Siegfied Grubitzsch and Günter Rexilius. Peter Mattes is the only founding member who belongs to the editorial team to this day. The journal was renamed »Psychology & Social Critique« in 1979 to mark its contrast from the book series called »Psychology & Society«. P&G was founded as a critical psychological journal but its authors pursued different paths than the Holzkamp school by consciously refraining from developing an overarching theoretical tradition. As a consequence, P&G refused to be pinned down to a unifying consensus. In contrast to Holzkamp's Critical Psychology, Marxist social theory has become somewhat less significant in this process. P&G is characterized by key topics rather than a theoretical framework. These topics build the central nodes of critical psychological discussion at P&G. Selected topics (in chronological order) include: psychiatry, psychotherapy, psychosocial practice (1978–80); psychology and politics, psychology during National Socialism (1979/80); aesthetic practices, mass communication and the media (1981); measurements, the industrialized psyche (1982); therapeutic practice, institutional practice, social control (1983/84); women and social (from 1983); identity]], subjectivity]], subject and politics (1987/89); National Socialism, euthanasia, and modernization (1991); postmodern challenges, construction, being oneself (1992/93), subject construction and subjectification (1996ff.), gender, childhood, and adolescence (since 2002), critical-psychoanalytic topics and articles (since 2003), and, again and again, critical-deconstructivist reflections on diverse aspects of life, culture, and institutions. Since the 1990s, the journal has witnessed an increasing influence of poststructuralist and discourse analytic concepts and of French and North-American postmodernist philosophy as well as social constructionism. Psychology & Social Critique has considerably diversified social psychologies in the German speaking countries. The critique of psychology, as exemplified by Psychology & Social Critique, deconstructs power and seeks out possibilities, in and around psychology, to think differently, to entertain discourses of ‘desubjugation' (Foucault), and to defy the dictates of normal scientific discourse.
Since the mid 1990s, the journal is being edited by an editorial collective with alternating members. Editorial members came mostly from the German Federal Republic and the West Berlin scene initially and from German and Austrian universities, where they engaged in research and teaching that offered alternatives to the psychological mainstream, since the 1990s. A heavy focus lay on the universities Bielefeld, Oldenburg, GH Wuppertal, Bremen, FU Berlin, and later Munich, Erlangen-Nurnberg, and Vienna. Over the years, Psychology & Social Critique has reconstructed, accompanied, and actively influenced critical intellectual discourse in and around psychology with its core topics.
Psychology & Social Critique is published as a German speaking journal quarterly (two of the four annual issues usually constitute a double issue). P&G is currently (as of 2014) in its 38th year and will publish its 150th thematic issue in 2014. P&G participates in the Social Science Open Access Repository (SSOAR) and provides of all articles for download. Papers published within the previous two years are not available for open access.
Objectives
Psychology and Social Critique both accompanies and criticizes mainstream psychology and aims at countering efforts to streamline all psychological knowledge into a single natural scientific method. The journal draws upon Anglo-American critical psychological, discourse theory and analysis, narrative and (de-)constructionist approaches, science and technology studies, gender studies, and psychoanalysis beyond the couch. Psychology and Social Critique mainly publishes theoretical papers as well as empirical studies based on qualitative social research.

Odest Chadwicke Jenkins (born 1975) is an American computer scientist who is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Michigan. Jenkins works on human–computer interaction and the design of robotic systems that learn from demonstration. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2006 and made a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2019.
Early life and education
Jenkins enjoyed playing Atari as a child and wanted to become a videogame designer. He became aware of Alma College because his mother worked with former President Alan Stone. Jenkins studied computer science and mathematics at Alma College. In 1993, he was inducted onto the Alma College Dean's List, and in 1996 won the Senior Leadership Award. Together with his classmate, Jim Blum, Jenkins set up the first Alma College web server in 1997. He moved to Georgia Tech for his graduate studies, working with Jessica Hodgins on simulations of basketball shooting. Jenkins moved to the University of Southern California for his doctoral studies, where he worked with Maja Matarić on humanoid agents. He completed his doctorate in 2003 and was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher.
Research and career
In 2004 Jenkins joined Brown University as an Assistant Professor. In 2006 he was awarded a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for his work on autonomous robot control and perception. Here he created a Robot Operating System (ROS) repository to improve reproducibility and interoperability of his robotic systems. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2010. In 2013 Jenkins was made a National Geographic explorer. In 2015 Jenkins joined the Computer Science and Engineering Division of the University of Michigan where he was made a Professor in Michigan's Robotics Institute.
Jenkins works on robot Learning from Demonstration (LfD), which looks to automate the processes behind human decision making and movement. Robots that are trained using LfD learn from user demonstration (as opposed to learning explicitly from a computer program). For example, Jenkins taught a robot to do the Cabbage Patch by programming it to watch his dance moves and then attempt to replicate them. Jenkins uses manifold learning (nonlinear dimensionality reduction) to identify dynamic processes and the fundamental structures of time series data. Jenkins has demonstrated LfD for the control of humanoid robots, the control of prosthetics and vision-based human tracking. He looks to improve public access to high quality robotic systems. With Henry Evans, a gentleman paralysed by stroke, Jenkins delivered a TED Talk on how robotics can benefit humanity. Jenkins created a quadrotor drone that allowed Evans to see parts of the world that had previously been inaccessible to him.
Jenkins has called for more African Americans to get involved with robotics, and for people to be more aware of whether everyone is being given equal opportunities in education and academia. He has supported students from underrepresented backgrounds in their participation at the Tapia Conference for the Celebration of Diversity in Computing. Jenkins led organisation of the Conference for African-Americans in the Mathematical Sciences. In 2019 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Ulysses Livingston (January 29, 1912, Bristol, Tennessee - October 7, 1988, Los Angeles) was an American jazz guitarist and bass guitarist.
Livingston's career in music began in the band of Horace Henderson as a roadie (or, as Henderson called them, "valet"). Prior to this he had played in the band of the West Virginia State College. After his period with Henderson he played in carnival bands on traveling road shows. In the middle of the 1930s he began to get jazz gigs with Lil Armstrong, Frankie Newton, Sammy Price, Coleman Hawkins, and Benny Carter. After moving to New York City, he accompanied Ella Fitzgerald on tour and on record. He served briefly in the military during World War II, but returned to jazz playing on the West Coast in 1943. He played with Cee Pee Johnson in Hawaii in 1947.
Alongside his guitar playing, Livingston also sang with the Spirits of Rhythm, and led a group called the Four Blazes. From the 1950s he did freelance work with West Coast jazz musicians and also became active as a record producer. In the 1970s he took up electric bass alongside the guitar, and recorded with both instruments.

Vlașca County is a former first-order administrative division of the Kingdom of Romania, in southern Muntenia, located between Bucharest and the Danube, which is now mostly the county of Giurgiu. The county seat was Giurgiu.
The county was located in the southern part of Greater Romania, in the southern part of the historical region of Muntenia. The county was bordered on the west by Teleorman County, on the northwest by Argeș County, on the north by Dâmbovița County, on the east by Ilfov County, and to the south by the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Its surface coincides in large part with that of the present Giurgiu County, but there are small parts of it that are included in today's Teleorman County.
Administrative organization
Administratively, until the 1930s, Vlașca County was divided into five districts (plăși):
Plasa Călugăreni, headquartered at Călugăreni
Plasa Câlniștea, headquartered at Drăgănești-Vlașca
Plasa Dunărea, headquartered at Giurgiu
Plasa Glavacioc, headquartered at Glavacioc
Plasa Neajlov, headquartered initially at Neajlovu, and later at Corbii Mari.
In 1938, the county was divided into seven districts:
Plasa Călugăreni, headquartered at Călugăreni
Plasa Câlniștea, headquartered at Drăgănești-Vlașca
Plasa Dunărea, headquartered at Giurgiu
Plasa Ghimpați, headquartered at Ghimpați
Plasa Glavacioc, headquartered at Glavacioc
Plasa Neajlov, headquartered initially at Neajlovu, and later at Corbii Mari.
Plasa Siliștea, headquartered at Siliștea Gumești
After 1938
In 1938, the county was disestablished and incorporated into the newly-formed Ținutul Argeș, but it was re-established in 1940 after the fall of Carol II's regime - only to be abolished 10 years later by the Communist regime.
Population
According to the 1930 census data, the county population was 296,412 inhabitants, ethnically divided as follows: 97.1% Romanians, 2.2% Romanies, 0.2% Hungarians, as well as other minorities. From the religious point of view, the population was 99.4% Eastern Orthodox, 0.2% Roman Catholic, 0.1% Adventist, as well as other minorities.
Urban population
In 1930, the county's urban population was 31,016 inhabitants, comprising 92.7% Romanians, 2.4% Romanies, 1.0% Hungarians, 0.7% Jews, as well as other minorities. From the religious point of view, the urban population was composed of 96.4% Eastern Orthodox, 1.3% Roman Catholic, 0.8% Jewish, as well as other minorities.

Todd David Cerney (August 8, 1953 – March 14, 2011) was an American songwriter and musician.
He composed "Good Morning Beautiful", a 2002 five-week country number one (Billboard) hit for Steve Holy (co-written with Zack Lyle); "The Blues Is My Business" (co-written with Kevin Bowe), part of Etta James' 2003 Grammy Award-winning album "Let's Roll"; and "I'll Still Be Loving You", a 1987 country number one (Billboard) hit for Restless Heart (co-written with Pam Rose, Mary Ann Kennedy, and Pat Bunch). He and his co-writers were nominated for a Grammy Award for "I'll Still Be Loving You". The song won the 1988 award for "ASCAP Country Song of the Year".
Cerney was born in Detroit, Michigan, and graduated from Zanesville High School in Zanesville, Ohio in 1971. He began his song-writing career after moving to Nashville, where he initially worked at Buzz Cason's Creative Workshop as an audio engineer. Some of the earliest artists to record his songs include Steve Carlisle ("I'll Fall in Love Again") and Levon Helm ("Blue House of Broken Hearts").
Music career
Cerney became known as the "Rock Doctor" after co-writing songs with members of various bands including Cheap Trick, Eddie Money, Loverboy and Bad English. Popular artists to record his compositions include Aretha Franklin (with the Four Tops) "If Ever A Love There Was" (part of the soundtrack for the film "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka" – the song hit the top 40 in both the R&B and Adult Contemporary charts (Billboard)), John Anderson's "Till I Get Used to the Pain" and Ty Herndon's "No Mercy", which peaked at #26 on the Billboard Country Music charts.
In 1988 Cerney traveled to Russia as one of 28 songwriters who participated in the Music Speaks Louder Than Words project – a collaboration between American and Soviet songwriters which included Michael Bolton and Cyndi Lauper. During his two weeks in Russia he cowrote the songs "Speak to My Heart" (performed by Phoebe Snow) and "Don't Stop Now" (performed by The Cover Girls, music by Viktor Reznikov).
In October 2009, Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton reunited for the first time in 25 years to sing "Tell Me That You Love Me," a duet that Cerney co-wrote. The song was featured in Rogers' three-CD box set "Kenny Rogers: The First 50 Years" on Time-Life Records. In 2010, American Idol runner-up Bo Bice included a song he co-wrote with Cerney, "Keep on Rollin'," on his "3" album.
Cerney played guitar, mandolin, harmonica, keyboards and sang lead and backing vocals with various artists including backing vocals for Kenny Rogers and Levon Helm, mandolin for the Dixie Chicks and the Nashville Mandolin Ensemble and a full range of instruments for various songwriter groups including Thom Shepherd & the Nashville Songwriters Band. He also worked with three former members of the soft-rock band Bread – Jimmy Griffin, Robb Royer and Larry Knechtel – forming "Toast" (later renamed "Radio Dixie") during the mid-1990s, recording a number of songs for an album release that remained unfinished.
Death
Cerney died in Nashville, Tennessee on March 14, 2011, from melanoma, a disease with which he had first been diagnosed with in November 2010, following a brain seizure. He was 57 years old.

Lambros Koutsonikas (, 1799 – 2 June 1879) was a Greek general and fighter of the Greek Revolution of 1821, army officer and amateur historian of the Revolution.
Biography
He was the son of Yiannos, from the Souliot Koutsonikas clan. His grandfather Nikos, his father and his brother Thanassis were killed in 1804 in a battle against the Albanians of Ali Pasha of Yanina at the Seltsou monastery in Tzoumerka. Lambros being a child that time, together with his mother and brother, were taken captives by Ali pasha's bands. Later, Lambros fought as head of an armed unit during the Greek Revolution of 1821. During the Revolution, he served in the Greek army and was promoted to the rank of pentakosiarchos (leader of 500 men). He died in 1879 in Agrinio.
Works
He authored the General History of the Greek Revolution (Γενική Ιστορία της Ελληνικής Επαναστάσεως), published in 1863–64 in Athens. The first volume of his work contains a large chapter on the history of Souli and the Souliotes, which is one of the few primary sources on the subject, written by a Souliote. Koutsonikas, based on oral tradition, claims that Souliotes resisted the Ottoman invasion since 15th century and they remained free and independent till early 19th century, and were the first who revolted in 1820.
The name of his clan is mentioned in some of the Souliotic Songs, initially published by Claude Fauriel in 1823 and republished later by others.

In the education system of New Zealand, a wānanga is a publicly-owned tertiary institution that provides education in a Māori cultural context. Section 162 of the New Zealand Education Act of 1989 specifies that wānanga resemble mainstream universities in many ways but expects them to be:
"... characterised by teaching and research that maintains, advances, and disseminates knowledge and develops intellectual independence, and assists the application of knowledge regarding ahuatanga Maori (Maori tradition) according to tikanga Maori (Maori custom)."
Wānanga educational programmes, accredited through the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) and through the Ministry of Education, are partly governed by New Zealand's Tertiary Education Commission (TEC). Wānanga offer certificates, diplomas, and bachelor-level degrees, with some wānanga providing programmes in specialized areas up to doctorate level.
Outside the 21st-century formal education system, the word wānanga in the Māori language traditionally conveys meanings related to highly evolved knowledge, lore, occult arts,
and also "forum" - in the sense of a discussion to arrive at deeper understanding.
The term "Whare Wānanga" is also widely used in the Māori names of New Zealand universities (e.g., Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato/University of Waikato).

New Jersey kept its delegation at six seats but changed from electing its Representatives on a statewide general ticket to using three plural districts of two seats each. These districts were used only for the 1812 election, and the state returned to using a single at-large district in 1814. This was only the second time that New Jersey used districts (the first being in 1798).
There was a statewide at-large election held in November 1812, that was invalidated:

John Bennett (born 21 March 1946, Liverpool) was an English professional footballer who played as a full back. He made 76 Football League appearances.
Playing career
Bennett began his career with hometown club Liverpool, who he served his apprenticeship with before signing professional forms in April 1963. However, he failed to make a league appearance over the next three years and left for Division Four side Chester in June 1966. This was as part of a triple transfer deal that also saw Alan Hignett and John Sealey move from Anfield to Sealand Road for free. Bennett made 36 league appearances in 1966–67, initially playing in the number six shirt before becoming the club's regular full-back later in the campaign.
The following two seasons saw him make 23 and 13 appearances respectively. He failed to score any league goals for the club but did score twice in a Welsh Cup victory over Brymbo Steelworks in the 1967–68 Welsh Cup quarter-finals. He played his final game for the club in a 4–2 defeat by York City on 28 April 1969, as he was allowed to leave the club in the summer. This marked the end of his professional career and he joined non–league side Macclesfield Town. In May 1970 Bennett played at Wembley Stadium in the first final of the FA Trophy, helping Macclesfield beat Telford United 2–0. They completed a league and cup double by winning the Northern Premier League the following week.

The chestnut-vented nuthatch (Sitta nagaensis) is a species of bird in the nuthatch family Sittidae. It is a medium-sized nuthatch, measuring in length. They are a solid gray blue, with a markedly black loral stripe. They are uniform gray to buff from the throat to belly, with brick red on the flanks. The undertail is white with a rufous border. The chestnut-vented nuthatch utters different kinds of calls, which can sometimes sound like a troglodyte alarm, and its song is a monotonous, stereotypical crackle, typically . Its ecology is poorly known, but it probably feeds on small arthropods and seeds, and the breeding season begins between March and May. The nest is typically located in a hole in the trunk of a tree, and the clutch has two to five eggs.
Chestnut-vented nuthatches are found in the northeast of India, in parts of Tibet and south-central China, descending into eastern Myanmar and northwestern Thailand. Isolated populations also live in southern Laos and Vietnam. It mainly lives in evergreen forests or pine forests, but can also live in mixed or deciduous forests. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. Its altitudinal distribution varies according to the localities, but ranges from . The species was described in 1874 by the British naturalist Henry Haversham Godwin-Austen, who named it Sitta nagaensis in reference to the Naga Hills, where the type material was collected. It belongs to the europaea group of species, including the Kashmir nuthatch (S. cashmirensis) and the Eurasian nuthatch (S. europaea)—all of which build the entrance to their nests. The numbers of the species are not estimated but appear to be declining. However, the bird's range is relatively wide, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature considers the species of the least concern.
Taxonomy
The chestnut-vented nuthatch was described as Sitta nagaensis in 1874 by the British naturalist Henry Haversham Godwin-Austen. Its species name is composed of naga and the Latin suffix -ensis, "that lives in, that inhabits," was given in reference to the area when the type of the species was collected, the Naga Hills. The chestnut-vented nuthatch is placed in the rarely-used subgenus Sitta (Linnaeus, 1758).
In 2014, Eric Pasquet and colleagues published a phylogeny based on examination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of 21 nuthatch species. The europaea group is related to the two nuthatches that live in rocky environments, the western rock nuthatch (S. neumayer) and the eastern rock nuthatch (S. tephronota). Within the europaea group, the white-tailed nuthatch (S. himalayensis) and therefore probably the white-browed nuthatch (S. victoriae), which closely resembles it in terms of its morphology, although it was not included in the study, appear to be basal, and the chestnut-vented nuthatch is closely related to the Eurasian nuthatch (S. europaea) and the Kashmir nuthatch (S. cashmirensis).
Subspecies
There are three recognized subspecies of the chestnut-vented nuthatch.
S. n. montium (La Touche, 1899), described as a mountain shape by Irish ornithologist John La Touche as protonym of Sitta montium, lives in eastern Tibet, southern and eastern China, Myanmar, and northwest Thailand.
S. n. nagaensis (Godwin-Austen, 1874), lives in northeast India and western Myanmar.
S. n. grisiventris (Kinnear, 1920), originally described under the protonym Sitta europaea grisiventris since S. n. nagaesis was itself considered a subspecies of the Eurasian nuthatch (S. europaea), it lives in southwest Myanmar and southern Laos and Vietnam.
The subspecies S. n. montium was considered to possibly be the result of hybridization between the chestnut-vented nuthatch and Sitta europaea sinensis, or at least to be able to interbreed with it. This is possibly due to the fact that the type series of S. e. sinensis was composite and included a specimen of the chestnut-vented nuthatch. For these reasons, Jean-François Voisin and colleagues designated a lectotype in 2002 for the name Sitta sinensis (Verreaux, 1871). The attribution of the populations of southwestern Myanmar and southern Indochina to the same subspecies, S. n. grisiventris with S. n. nagaensis interspersed between these populations in western Myanmar seems untenable and their taxonomy has yet to be verified.
Description
Plumage and measurements
The chestnut-vented nuthatch is a medium-sized nuthatch, measuring in length. They are a solid blue-gray from crown to tail, with a marked black loral line extending to the base of the wing. They are pale gray, more or less tinted buff-tinged depending on the subspecies or the wear of the plumage; the dark brick-red back flanks contrast strongly with the rest of the underparts. The , which may be of the same color depending on the subspecies, have a large white border at the end of the feathers or a white patch near the tip.
The species does not show marked sexual dimorphism. The male's rear flanks are deep brick-red, deeper and less orange than the undertail coverts, whereas the female's flanks are rufous, concolorous with the undertail coverts. Females also have duller underparts, and juveniles are more buff than adults with worn plumage. The iris is brown to dark brown, the bill is grayish-black to blackish with the base of the lower mandible (and sometimes the base of the upper) slate-gray or blue-gray. The legs are dark brown, greenish or blue-gray, with almost black claws.
Three subspecies are recognized, but variations are essentially clinal, with Chinese populations (S. n. montium) having buff underparts, which get duller and purer gray as they move southward in the species' distribution. In Northeast India and western Myanmar, S. n. nagaensis in fresh plumage is as buff as S. n. montium in worn plumage. In southern Vietnam and southwestern Myanmar, S. n. grisiventris has purer gray underparts than S. n. nagaensis. Adults undergo a complete moult after the breeding season, from May to June, and an incomplete moult occurs before it.
Similar species
The range of the chestnut-vented nuthatch overlaps with that of the Burmese nuthatch (S. neglecta). However, the chestnut-vented nuthatch is easily distinguished by the color of its underparts, and the lack of contrast between the sides of the head and the throat, whereas the other species has white chins, cheeks, and parotid region contrasting with brick-red to orange-brown underparts. However, in the chestnut-vented nuthatch, some individuals in fresh plumage (especially in S. n. montium) may have underparts almost as buff as some Burmese nuthatch females or juveniles. The chestnut-vented nuthatch can then be recognized by its darker, duller blue upperparts, by its red flanks contrasting with the buff, and by its undertail, with feathers edged with red giving a "scales" pattern, when they appear almost uniformly white in the Burmese nuthatch.
The subspecies S. n. montium can also be confused with the subspecies S. e. sinensis of the Eurasian nuthatch (S. europaea) where they coexist in Sichuan and Fujian. If the latter species has more orange underparts, some Eurasian females may be difficult to differentiate from chestnut-vented nuthatches in fresh plumage. The two species can be distinguished by their vocalizations, with chestnut-vented nuthatch lacking the characteristic singing dwip of the Euraisan nuthatch. Hybrids between these two taxa have been hypothesized, with montane populations of S. e. sinensis being, like the chestnut-vented nuthatch, grayer on the underside, darker above, and larger than lowland individuals. The chestnut-vented nuthatch, however, is even grayer, and does not have the whitish cheeks of the Eurasian nuthatch.
In southwest China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch lives within the range of the Yunnan nuthatch (S. yunnanensis). However, the latter is smaller, has a thin white supercilium, and has plain, pale buff underparts with no russet on the flanks. In northeastern India and northwestern Myanmar, the chestnut-vented nuthatch may be confused with the white-tailed nuthatch (S. himalayensis), the both species inhabit similar habitats. The white-tailed nuthatch, however, has a white spot on the top of the middle rectrices, and has more orange underparts, without brick-red flanks or white spots on the undertail. The giant nuthatch (S. magna), whose distribution overlaps with that of the chestnut-vented nuthatch in India, Myanmar, and Thailand, differs from the latter in being much larger in size, having a finer , and having a calotte that is much lighter than the rest of the .
Ecology and behavior
The chestnut-vented nuthatch generally surveys alone or in pairs, or forms mixed-species foraging flocks outside of the breeding season. In winter, it can thus be observed in the company of different species of tits (Paridae) such as the yellow-cheeked tit (Maclolophus spilonotus), or Aegithalidae, woodpeckers, alcippes, and minlas.
Vocalizations
The chestnut-vented nuthutch's calls are varied, with squeaky sit or sit-sit sounds, repeated more or less rapidly with various inflections and in irregular series. Similar but drier tchip or tchit sounds are sometimes made, often in a trill reminiscent of the alarm of the winter wren (Troglodytes hiemalis). The alarm calls of the chestnut-vented nuthatch are reported in English-language literature as nasal sounds in quir, kner or mew, as well as an emphatic, metallic tsit, sometimes doubled or repeated in quick series. The song is a stereotyped, monotonous rattle or tremolo in ... or ..., lasting less than a second or sometimes slowed down to ... or reminiscent of the song of the Eurasian nuthatch.
Food
The chestnut-vented nuthatch often forages for food on the ground, on rocks, old stumps, or on trees. No specific information about the diet is known, but the species probably feeds on small arthropods and seeds.
Breeding
Although the breeding season varies by region, it generally takes place in Thailand from March to May, March to June for India, April to early June for eastern Myanmar, and April to May in Fujian. On Nat Ma Taung, juveniles have been observed as early as March 31. According to observations made in Thailand and Vietnam, the construction of the nest begins in January. It is located at a height of about in the hole of a tree, or in a stump.
The chestnut-vented nuthatch, like the Eurasian nuthatch and other species of the family, may line the entrance of a cavity with mud to reduce the opening and thus avoid predation of the brood. The bottom of the nest is lined with pieces of bark and moss and topped with hair. Two to five eggs are laid, averaging in S. n. nagaensis and in S. n. montium. They are white, with red dots on a mottled reddish-purple background, and are mainly concentrated at the larger end of the egg.
Distribution and habitat
The chestnut-vented nuthatch lives from Tibet to the South Central Coast of Vietnam. In India, it is found only in the far eastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Assam and Meghalaya. The species lives in the Chin Hills of western Myanmar, but most of its distribution in Myanmar is in the eastern half of the country, from Kachin State to at least Shan State, spilling over into western Thailand. The species nests in Tibet and south-central China, from western Sichuan to Yunnan and marginally in southwestern Guizhou. An isolated Chinese population also lives in northwestern Fujian, on Mount Huanggang. Two other isolated populations from the southernmost part of the species' distribution, one occurring in southern Vietnam on the Đà Lạt Plateau, another being reported in Laos on the Bolaven Plateau.
The chestnut-vented nuthatch usually inhabits evergreen forests of the uplands, or forests and pine patches growing on dry ridges in the middle of evergreen forests. Locally, it also occurs in deciduous forests in northeastern India, in Quercus subsericea oak forests and alder groves in northeastern Myanmar, spruce forests (Picea sp.), fir forests (Abies sp.) or rhododendron stands in Yunnan, or poplar (Populus sp.) and walnut (Juglans sp.) in Sichuan. The altitudinal distribution ranges from in India, Thailand, and Myanmar, occasionally occurring up to in the latter. It also occurs from in Tibet and Sichuan and up to in Yunnan. The population in southern Vietnam lives between .
Status and threats
The population of the chestnut-vented nuthatch is declining due to habitat destruction and fragmentation, but its range is large and was estimated to be 3.8 million km2 (1.5 million square miles), and the species is generally common throughout its range. For these reasons, the chestnut-vented nuthatch is considered to be of the least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. A study carried out in 2009 tried to predict the impact of climate change on the distribution of several species of nuthatches in Asia by modeling two scenarios. It predicted that the chestnut-vented nuthatch could see its distribution decrease between the 2040s and 2069 by 15.9 to 17.4%.

Bewitched is a 1945 American film noir directed and written by Arch Oboler. The drama features Phyllis Thaxter and Edmund Gwenn.
Plot
The story is told as a flashback: It is late at night, and Dr. Bergson (Edmund Gwenn) is dictating case notes to his secretary. He suggests pausing but she is so intrigued by the case that she asks him to continue.
On the night of a lovely party celebrating her engagement to Bob Arnold (Harry H. Daniels Jr.), a demure young woman named Joan Ellis (Phyllis Thaxter) at last succumbs to the voice in her head (Audrey Totter) and flees her Midwestern home to New York City, leaving behind a loving family and circle of friends who are shocked, bewildered and frightened for her. She leaves a note asking her parents (Addison Richards, Kathleen Lockhart) not to search for her.
Going by the name Joan Smith, she builds a new life in the city and falls in love with Eric Russell (Horace McNally), an attorney. The voice, which calls itself Karen, approves of this mature man, and when Karen emerges, briefly, while they are on a river cruise, she kisses him with a fiercely devouring, possessive passion that is unnerving. When Joan regains control, she asks “What did I do?” and bursts into tears. Eric is very worried, but she won't talk to him about it. (Joan's inability to tell anyone about what she is experiencing adds greatly to the tension and suspense in the film. Repeatedly, the story reaches a point where she might be expected to confide in someone, but the moments always pass.)
At last, after a long search, loving, loyal Bob finds her. He is thrilled, but while he is helping her pack, Karen takes control of Joan's right hand and compels her to pick up a pair of scissors and stab him in the back. She is put on trial for murder, a capital offense. Dr. Bergson is brought in as an expert witness; he says that Joan is not insane. She remains silent, and Eric uses this silence to convince the jury that there is more to the story and, whatever the truth may be, she is innocent of murder. After a long deliberation, the jury returns, smiling; clearly they have found her not guilty. In Joan's mind, Karen exults: She will have Eric now, and when she tires of him, he will meet the same fate as Bob. Joan leaps to her feet screaming over and over “I'm guilty!”
In prison awaiting execution, Joan refuses to explain to anyone. Lying on her cot in utter misery, she weakly murmurs to Eric “I want to die. When I die, she dies.”
This sets Dr. Bergson thinking, and, with the execution imminent, he persuades the governor (Minor Watson) to listen to his theory—that here are two women living in one body, one guilty and one innocent. He takes a book from the governor's library shelf that addresses this very subject, but it is unread, and he has to ask the governor's wife (Virginia Brissac) for a paper knife to slit some pages. Eric is also present.
Saying grimly “There will be an execution tonight,” Dr. Bergson hypnotizes Joan. In the film, Joan and Karen emerge—transparent, in the classic photographic representation of spirits—and stand on each side of Joan's seated form. Karen wears heavy make up and her expression is a feral smile. Neither entity speaks. Dr. Bergstrom tells Joan that she is getting stronger and Karen that she is getting weaker—dying in fact. Under his repeated assaults, the image of Karen fades and disappears. Joan slumps forward into Eric's arms and then straightens, smiling.

Production
The film was produced in November–December 1944, while World War II was raging. It opens and closes with a voice over that justifies the telling of Joan's story at such a time.
According to Jeremy Arnold at TCM.com, the film “had an extremely low budget. But Oboler's radio expertise made the most of it, and he filled the picture with stylistic flourishes that came from radio. The use of sound effects, editing, stylized dialogue, and heightened, punchy music all reveal the radio influence. The music, in fact, was so important to Oboler that he fought to get a good composer who was actually scoring 'A' movies - Bronislau Kaper, who had just finished scoring Gaslight(1944) and Without Love (1945). Finally, Oboler gave Thaxter's evil personality its own voice, well supplied by an unbilled Audrey Totter, a film noir fixture (Lady in the Lake (1947), Tension, 1950) whose career began in radio in 1939.”
Critical reception
When the film was first released, the staff at Variety liked it and wrote "Produced on a low budget, with a sterling cast of actors' actors, this picture just oozes with class because of the excellent adaptation and direction it has been given by radio's Arch Oboler, author of the story "Alter Ego", on which the film is based. Climax follows climax, strong performance follows strong performance in this thrilling psychopathic study of a girl obsessed by an inner voice that drives her to murder."

Nicolaas Jozef Hubertus (Hubert or Huub) Levigne (30 September 1905 – 29 December 1989) was a Dutch graphic artist, glazier and professor.
Life and work
Hubert or Huub Levigne was a son of Nicolas Joseph Levigne and Elisabeth Ramakers. He grew up in Maastricht and took drawing and painting lessons from at the Stadsteekeninstituut in Maastricht. He then left for Amsterdam to study at the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten (1928–1932), where he was taught by Jan Aarts (graphics) and Rik Roland Holst (monumental art).
Levigne was a member of the , a group of painters, architects, poets, writers and other culture enthusiasts who spent many evenings in the Café Suisse on the Vrijthof in Maastricht in the 1920s (just like the members of the ). He also joined the Nederlandsche Vereeniging voor Ambachts- en Nijverheidskunst.
After completing his training in Amsterdam in 1933 and after winning the silver medal at the Prix de Rome, he returned to Maastricht. In addition to his own free work, he also carried out commissions for postage stamps, occasional graphics, ex libris and ecclesiastical art. Levigne worked with copper engravings, etchings, woodcuts and with a combination of etchings and aquatint. He also painted and made monumental work such as tile pictures and stained glass. Levigne was a pupil of Roland Holst, but his glassware mainly shows the influence of the Limburg glaziers.
In 1950 Levigne, and Frits Peutz were appointed professors at the Jan van Eyck Academy. Ten Horn taught monumental painting and glazing, Peutz taught architecture and Levigne taught graphic design. He held this position until his retirement in 1972. After this he lived in Spain for a few years and then again until his death in Limburg.

Edward Hunter (November 22, 1839 – October 12, 1928) was a career American Army officer, who graduated from the West Point on June 23, 1865. He served in California, Georgia, Idaho, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Puerto Rico, Virginia, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Early life and family
He was born in Gardiner, Maine, and died at Mount Vernon, New York. He married Caroline Clay Hoff, (August 1, 1850 – July 1931) on March 27, 1870 in San Francisco, California. He was the son-in-law of Brevet Colonel Alexander Henry Hoff, Surgeon, US Army and the brother-in-law of Colonel John Van Rennselaer Hoff, Deputy Surgeon General, US Army; January 1902.
Career
He was commissioned a second lieutenant upon graduation from West Point and was promoted immediately as a first lieutenant in the 12th Infantry Regiment.
He spent his early years as an Indian fighter before transferring to the Judge Advocate General's Corps and Adjutant General's Corps. He took part in the campaigns against the Cheyenne, Arapahoe, Kiowa and Comanche, 1868; the Nez Perce War, 1877; and the Bannock War, 1878; and numerous other nameless skirmishes during that time including the Battle of Soldier Spring.
His first duty was the charge of military prisons in the Department of Virginia upon the surrender of Confederate Forces after the Civil War. These included Libby Prison (this was for Union officers only and because of its high death toll, Libby Prison is generally regarded as second in notoriety only to Andersonville Prison in Georgia) and Castle Thunder Prison (equally known for its brutality and used to hold civilians, political prisoners and spies); and the state penitentiary.
He was then transferred to the Department of New Mexico. He was promoted to captain of the 1st Cavalry Regiment in August 1880.
He transferred to the Department of the Columbia and was stationed at Fort Walla Walla, Washington Territory, (now the city of Walla Walla, Washington), and Fort Colville, (near the now the city of Colville, Washington), in 1877 during and the early 1880s. His daughter Jane Richards Hunter was born at Fort Walla Walla, Washington Territory on July 15, 1882.
He next served for two years in Washington, D.C. as an examiner of claims arising from the Civil War.
He transferred to the Department of California in San Francisco as adjutant of the 12th Infantry. He was then transferred to the 1st Cavalry Regiment and appointed first quartermaster and then adjutant of the regiment. He was adjutant-general of the expedition against the Paiutes. He read for the law and was prompted to major and judge-advocate for the Department of California in December 1888 and was admitted to the California Bar. At the time he was president of the California Sons of the American Revolution.
In 1895, he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and deputy judge-advocate and adjutant general in the Department of Dakota at Fort Snelling, St. Paul, Minnesota. When the Spanish–American War broke out he served first at Chickamauga as the mustering officer and then in 1898 he served under General Brooke as judge-advocate in Puerto Rico and as secretary of the committee on evacuation. He was invalided back to the United States because of ill health.
He was promoted to Colonel and judge advocate general for the Department of the East at Governors Island, New York in May 1901. He retired in 1903 on half pay at the mandatory retirement age of 64.

Eggplant papoutsaki (Greek: μελιντζάνα παπουτσάκι) (Turkish: Patlıcan pabucaki) is an eggplant dish of the Greek cuisine and Turkish cuisine. "Papuc" or "papuç" is a Persian word "paposh" (پاپٯش) that is also used in Turkish and has the meaning of "shoe" or "slipper". The basic dish consists of eggplants which have been boiled or roasted and the tops cut off lengthwise, (which is why they resemble little shoes). The flesh is scooped out and mixed with other ingredients, sometimes ground beef, sometimes eggs, green peppers or bell peppers, green onions, tomatoes, lemon, and olive oil. It is topped with a hard, salty cheese such as kefalotyri, Mihaliç Peyniri or kasseri and grilled.

The 2013 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier was an international cricket tournament held in Dublin, Ireland, from 23 July to 1 August 2013. The tournament was the inaugural edition of the Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier, with the top three teams advancing to the 2014 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh.
Eight teams played in the tournament. The host, Ireland, was joined by the two lowest-placed teams from the 2012 World Twenty20, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, as well as five teams from regional qualifying tournaments. Pakistan and Sri Lanka both went on to be undefeated at the tournament, sharing the title after the final was interrupted by rain. Ireland defeated the Netherlands in the third-place playoff to also qualify for the World Twenty20.
Qualification and format
Originally, the ICC had determined that only the winner of the tournament would qualify for the World Twenty20, with that tournament then having only eight teams. This decision was altered at the 2013 International Cricket Council (ICC) annual conference in June 2013, as part of a concerted effort to support women's cricket. The eight teams at the qualifier were divided into two groups based on their ranking, with the four teams that failed to make the semi-finals going on to participate in a repêchage tournament (the Shield).

The Blue Book Network, also known as The Contractor's Blue Book or simply as The Blue Book, is a marketing, workflow software and print media company.
The company name is rooted in the fact that for over 104 years they have published numerous regional buyers guides listing commercial construction companies, largely subcontractors and suppliers. Now twice annually (Spring & Fall), 32 regional blue book editions are delivered to property managers, facilities managers and commercial general contractors. It is often compared to a yellow page for contractors, given the focus on mini ads within The Who's Who of Building & Construction and the more recent evolution of search engine marketing.
History
The company traces its roots to when Joseph O'Malley, president of The Society of the Allied Building Trades, first published a subcontractor's registry for New York City in 1913. The Subcontractors Register for the Allied Building Trades was a directory of subcontractors for the New York City area, listing companies by their trade. It was published by Joseph O'Malley (1893–1985) who was later joined by his nephew, Walter Francis O'Malley, as editor. The 1942 version calls itself: "A Classified List for the Allied Building Trades of Sub-Contractors, Material Dealers & Manufacturers, General Contractors & Builders, Architects - Engineers, Real Estate Management Firms".
In 1999, the company extended its focus to include bid messaging and private project reporting. A private and secure online plan room providing full reporting called BB-Bid was released at no cost to general contractors and property/facility managers. The BB-Bid software (now rebranded as http://OneTeam.build) allows a user to upload a construction project onto the site and message the bid to the subcontracting and supplier community, regardless of their presence in the paid print directory.
In 2013, the company became an Employee Owned Corporation with the creation of an employee stock ownership plan devised by then owner James O'Malley. James O'Malley had been the CEO for over 50 years.
In 2014 they partnered with .BUILD to help commercial construction companies secure their targeted domain and appropriate domain name registration.
In 2016, The Blue Book introduced its new regional construction magazines - The Who's Who in Building & Construction (and each edition includes their regional buyer's guide). The magazines are published in both the spring and fall.
In 2019 The Blue Book Network, released Engage a FREE business communication app built specifically for the US commercial construction industry.

Vijay is very ambitious and opposite to his father; he wants to get rich soon, for which he marries a wealthy girl Sapna (Shoma Anand) and becomes ghar jamai. Vijay's father-in-law, who is a builder wants to acquire Gangaaram's ancestral property. Vijay and Sapna manipulate Gangaaram and bring him to their own home. Gangaaram and his wife happily take care of their grandson Ravi (Neil Nitin Mukesh) and bring him up with good values. as Vijay builds a building on the property of his father, both Sapna and Vijay start showing their true colours. During that period, Ravi gets emotionally attached to his grandparents. As the story takes a leap, the young Ravi (Govinda) who sees his grandfather in a really bad state starts taking revenge from his parents just to make them realise their own mistake. Radha (Kimi Katkar), who is in love with Ravi also helps him in his drama of teaching a lesson to his parents. The story revolves around the concept of the proverb "What you sow, you shall reap".

The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) is a centimeter-wavelength radio astronomy observatory located in central New Mexico on the Plains of San Agustin, between the towns of Magdalena and Datil, ~ west of Socorro. The VLA comprises twenty-eight 25-meter radio telescopes (twenty-seven of which are operational while one is always rotating through maintenance) deployed in a Y-shaped array and all the equipment, instrumentation, and computing power to function as an interferometer. Each of the massive telescopes is mounted on double parallel railroad tracks, so the radius and density of the array can be transformed to adjust the balance between its angular resolution and its surface brightness sensitivity. Astronomers using the VLA have made key observations of black holes and protoplanetary disks around young stars, discovered magnetic filaments and traced complex gas motions at the Milky Way's center, probed the Universe's cosmological parameters, and provided new knowledge about the physical mechanisms that produce radio emission.
The VLA stands at an elevation of above sea level. It is a component of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). The NRAO is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.
Characteristics
The radio telescope comprises 27 independent antennas in use at a given time plus one spare, each of which has a dish diameter of 25 meters (82 feet) and weighs . The antennas are distributed along the three arms of a track, shaped in a wye (or Y) -configuration, (each of which measures long). Using the rail tracks that follow each of these arms—and that, at one point, intersect with U.S. Route 60 at a level crossing—and a specially designed lifting locomotive ("Hein's Trein"), the antennas can be physically relocated to a number of prepared positions, allowing aperture synthesis interferometry with up to 351 independent baselines: in essence, the array acts as a single antenna with a variable diameter. The angular resolution that can be reached is between 0.2 and 0.04 arcseconds.
There are four commonly used configurations, designated A (the largest) through D (the tightest, when all the dishes are within of the center point). The observatory normally cycles through all the various possible configurations (including several hybrids) every 16 months; the antennas are moved every three to four months. Moves to smaller configurations are done in two stages, first shortening the east and west arms and later shortening the north arm. This allows for a short period of improved imaging of extremely northerly or southerly sources.
The frequency coverage is to (400 cm to 0.7 cm).
The Pete V. Domenici Science Operations Center (DSOC) for the VLA is located on the campus of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, New Mexico. The DSOC also serves as the control center for the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), a VLBI array of ten 25-meter dishes located from Hawaii in the west to the U.S. Virgin Islands in the east that constitutes the world's largest dedicated, full-time astronomical instrument.
Upgrade and renaming
In 2011, a decade-long upgrade project resulted in the VLA expanding its technical capacities by factors of up to 8,000. The 1970s-era electronics were replaced with state-of-the-art equipment. To reflect this increased capacity, VLA officials asked for input from both the scientific community and the public in coming up with a new name for the array, and in January 2012 it was announced that the array would be renamed the "Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array". On March 31, 2012, the VLA was officially renamed in a ceremony inside the Antenna Assembly Building.
Key science
The VLA is a multi-purpose instrument designed to allow investigations of many astronomical objects, including radio galaxies, quasars, pulsars, supernova remnants, gamma-ray bursts, radio-emitting stars, the sun and planets, astrophysical masers, black holes, and the hydrogen gas that constitutes a large portion of the Milky Way galaxy as well as external galaxies. In 1989 the VLA was used to receive radio communications from the Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flew by Neptune. A search of the galaxies M31 and M32 was conducted in December 2014 through January 2015 with the intent of quickly searching trillions of systems for extremely powerful signals from advanced civilizations.
It has been used to carry out several large surveys of radio sources, including the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters.
In September 2017 the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS) began. This survey will cover the entire sky visible to the VLA (80% of the Earth's sky) in three full scans. Astronomers expect to find about 10 million new objects with the survey — four times more than what is presently known.
History
The driving force for the development of the VLA was David S. Heeschen. He is noted as having "sustained and guided the development of the best radio astronomy observatory in the world for sixteen years." Congressional approval for the VLA project was given in August 1972, and construction began some six months later. The first antenna was put into place in September 1975 and the complex was formally inaugurated in 1980, after a total investment of . It was the largest configuration of radio telescopes in the world.
With a view to upgrading the venerable 1970s technology with which the VLA was built, the VLA has evolved into the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA). The upgrade has enhanced the instrument's sensitivity, frequency range, and resolution with the installation of new hardware at the San Agustin site. A second phase of this upgrade may add up to eight additional dishes in other parts of the state of New Mexico, up to away, if funded.
Magdalena Ridge Observatory is a new observatory under construction a few miles south of the VLA. It includes an optical interferometer and is run by VLA collaborator New Mexico Tech.
Tourism
Although science operations continue, the VLA grounds and visitor center were closed to the public in March 2020 and remain closed. As of March 2022, the NRAO has not yet finalized plans to re-open the VLA to the public.
The VLA is located between the towns of Magdalena and Datil, about west of Socorro, New Mexico. U.S. Route 60 passes east–west through the complex.
Prior to March 2020, the VLA site was open to visitors year round during daylight hours. On every first and third Saturdays of the month, special guided and behind-the-scenes tours were offered. A visitor center houses a small museum, theater, and a gift shop. A self-guided walking tour was available, as the visitor center was not staffed continuously. Visitors unfamiliar with the area are warned that there is little food on site, or in the sparsely populated surroundings; those unfamiliar with the high desert are warned that the weather is quite variable, and can remain cold into April. For those who cannot travel to the site, the NRAO created a virtual tour of the VLA called the VLA Explorer.
In popular culture
The VLA has appeared repeatedly in popular culture since its construction.
The VLA is present in the 1984 movie 2010: The Year We Make Contact, as the location where Dr. Floyd and Dimitri Moiseyevich discuss the upcoming missions to Jupiter.
The VLA is present in the 1997 movie Contact, as the location where the alien signal is first detected.
British artist Keith Tyson created a 300 piece sculpture called Large Field Array (2006–2007) named after the VLA.
In the 2009 science-fiction film Terminator Salvation, the VLA is the location of a Skynet facility. At the beginning of the film the site is attacked by Resistance forces.
A parody of the VLA, known as The Big Ear, appears in the 2004 action-adventure video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, sharing its name with a SETI project from Ohio State University. A single huge dish forms The Big Ear in-game.
In Season 2, Episode 1 of the BBC series "Luther", which first aired 29 sep 2011, the character Alice Morgan (played by Ruth Wilson) tells Luther that "I've always wanted to go and see the Very Large Array in New Mexico. It's not the biggest in the world, of course, or the most iconic, but I grew up wanting to see it. It's quite spectacular, out there in the desert."
Trivia
An image of the Very Large Array appeared on the cover of Bon Jovi's 2002 studio album, Bounce.

U-658 was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.
Service history
The boat's career began with training at 8th U-boat Flotilla on 5 November 1941, followed by active service on 1 August 1942 as part of the 6th Flotilla for the remainder of her service.
In two patrols she sank three merchant ships, for a total of and damaged one other.
Wolfpacks
U-658 took part in two wolfpacks, namely:
Panther (13 – 20 October 1942)
Veilchen (20 – 30 October 1942)
Fate
U-658 was sunk on 30 October 1942 in the North Atlantic east of Newfoundland, in position , by depth charges from RCAF Hudson bomber from 145 Squadrons. There were no survivors.

Bunodosoma californicum is a species of sea anemone. Is first described to science by Oskar Carlgren in 1951. The type specimen that Carlgren used to describe the species was collected by Ed Ricketts in Puerto Escondido during his trip to the Gulf of California with John Steinbeck recounted in The Log From the Sea of Cortez.
Description
The column is variable in color from olive green to greenish-brown to rusty red. The column may be up to tall, with a base between and wide. The column is covered in rounded bumps called vesicles. Unlike some similar sea anemones, these vesicles are not adhesive, and thus the column of Bunodosoma californica will typically be clean, not covered with bits of shell or other detritus. The vesicles are arranged in neat longitudinal rows at the base of the column and more random, but still densely packed, further up the column. They are about the same color as the column.
The oral disc is the same color as the column and may have light radial lines.
There are typically 80 conical tentacles arranged in three or four rings around the oral disc, but individuals vary and may have more or fewer tentacles. The basic color of the tentacles is the same as the column, and some individuals may show rose, purple or orange tints. The tentacles are often marked with white at their base. Tentacles are slightly shorter than the width of the oral disc.
Distribution
Bunodosoma californicum lives on rocky bottoms from the intertidal zone to the subtidal. It can be found from the Gulf of California to Panama.
Life history
Bunodosoma californium is a carnivore. It uses the stinging cells, nematocysts, in its tentacles to paralyze its prey. The tentacles then push the food into the mouth in the center of the oral disc.
These anemones are gonochoric, that is there are two sexes and each animal is either male or female. They reproduce by broadcast spawning, releasing eggs and sperm into the sea to achieve fertilization. Some anemones are able to reproduce by fission, in essence cloning themselves. It is unknown whether this anemone is capable of asexual fission in addition to sexual reproduction.

Dalton Grange Hall No. 23 was a historic Grange hall in Dalton, Massachusetts. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and demolished in 1987. Built in 1879, it was the first Grange hall to be built and owned by a Grange chapter in the state.
Description
The Dalton Grange Hall was located in western Dalton, at the northeast corner of South Street and Grange Hall Road. It was a 1-1/2 story T-shaped wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It was stylistically vernacular, with modest Queen Anne features. The main facade had three bays, with sash windows flanking the entrance. The entrance was sheltered by a gabled hood.
History
The Dalton Grange was founded in 1873, initially meeting in the Dalton Town Hall. Six years later the organization raised funds, received donations of materials and land, and constructed this hall for $300. The building was first used (in an unfinished state) in May 1879, and was formally dedicated December 10, 1879. It was the first Grange hall in the state to be owned by the membership. The building became a social center in the town, and was expanded c. 1900, adding a dining hall and kitchen. A bowling alley was added at the same time. In the 20th century the hall played host to a number of civic activities and organizations. After World War II the decline in agriculture in the area led to an aging membership, and a decline in the ability to maintain the facilities. Despite appeals for assistance from the state-level grange, the building was demolished in 1987. A boulder with a plaque mounted on it now commemorates the site.

The Palace of the Kings Bell situated in Douala is a building constructed in 1905 by the Germans for King Auguste Manga Ndumbe (King Bell). The building is also known as La Pagode; this name comes from the French writer Louis-Ferdinand Céline, who remained in Douala in 1916-17, who calls it such in his famous novel Voyage au bout de la nuit (Journey to the End of the Night).
History
Ascending to the throne in 1897, Auguste Manga Ndumbe created a large plantation of cocoa and palm oil in Mungo on the effluents of the Kamerun-Wui river, so as to compensate for the decline of the Douala economy based on the trade monopoly with the hinterland. He also carried out significant real estate investments in Bonanjo. At that time, the fortune of Auguste Manga exceeded by far that of his contemporaries and those of Akwa, Deïdo, and Bonabéri. He only lived in this residence for three years, dying in 1908. His son and heir Rudolph Douala Manga Bell reigned from 1908 to 1914, with his wife Emma Engomè Dayas. She was the daughter of British Captain Dayas and a young woman from Bali, Tébédi Eyoum. They lived here until the German authorities jailed Rudolph and hanged him on 8 August 1914. Alexandre Douala Manga Bell, son of the late Rudolph, celebrated as a hero and martyr, chose to live in Bali rather than this mansion. Known today as Le Parc des Princes, this compound includes the Bell's Chefferie. Since 1920, the old mansion has been occupied by a long list of inhabitants and is still owned by the Bell royal family. Because of its history and its architecture, this building has always been an icon in Douala.
In 2006 the building was highlighted by a sign produced by doual'art and designed by Sandrine Dole; the sign presented an historical image of the building and a description of its history.

The Richmond River is a river situated in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia.
Course and features
The river rises at the northern end of the Richmond Range, near its junction with the McPherson Range, on the Queensland/ New South Wales border, west of Mount Lindesay, and flows generally south east and north east, joined by twelve tributaries, including the Wilsons River, before reaching its mouth at its confluence with the Coral Sea of the South Pacific Ocean near Ballina; descending over its course.
On its journey it passes through the towns of Kyogle, Casino, Coraki and Woodburn. Summerland Way is situated adjacent to much of the middle reaches of the course of Richmond River. At Ballina, the Pacific Highway crosses the river.
The catchment area of the river is estimated at , which makes it the sixth largest catchment in New South Wales; and its floodplain has an area of over .
History
Aboriginal history
The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Richmond River are the Aboriginal people of the Githabul, whose territory reached north to the current city of Toowoomba and included the current towns of Tenterfield and Warwick. One of the annual rituals of the Githabul people was the movement from the mountain ranges to the coast during the winter months, when the mullet were plentiful.
European history
Omitted by Captain James Cook when he sailed up the east coast of the Australian mainland in 1770, it wasn't until Captain Henry John Rous identified the mouth of the river in 1828 that it was discovered by Europeans. Rous entered the river and sailed about up river. He subsequently named the river Richmond after the fifth Duke of Richmond. Later that year the explorer Allan Cunningham reached the river by land.
The river was a major port from the 1840s until well into the 20th century. Soon after the first white settlers arrived they discovered the abundant supply of Australian Red Cedar in the Richmond Valley and immediately began logging. The river was vital in the transportation of this resource.
At the time of its discovery in 1828 and until the late 1890s the river had a treacherous mouth of shifting sand bars, and many ships and people died on it. Understandably, a decision was made to construct two breakwaters to channel the river's flow and these were completed in the early 1900s. The construction of the breakwaters also led to the formation of Shaw's Bay (after sand built up behind what is now called Lighthouse or Main Beach).
In 1846, a conflict between white settlers and local Aborigines in the river valley (the Richmond River massacre) caused the deaths of around 100 of the latter.
With the decline of shipping as a transport mode, owing to better roads and rail, and the closing of the North Coast Steam Navigation Company (the major shipping firm of the area) in 1954, the river became less important as a port.
Current usage
For boats, the river is navigable for a short way up its length, possibly as far as Casino. Wilsons River, which flows through the city of Lismore and is a major tributary of the Richmond, is navigable at least as far as Boatharbour, approximately upstream from Lismore.
The Richmond River is heavily used for irrigation along its length. Several weirs have been constructed in order to mitigate the effects of flooding, most notably at Casino.
Fauna
The freshwater reaches of the Richmond River once supported the endemic Richmond River Cod, similar to Murray Cod and possibly a subspecies of Eastern Freshwater Cod. Unfortunately this unique native fish became extinct between the 1930s and 1950s due to habitat degradation and gross overfishing, including with dynamite during the building of the local railway line. The endangered Oxleyan Pygmy Perch has been recorded from the river.

The College of Coastal Georgia (Coastal Georgia) is a public college in Brunswick, Georgia. It was established in 1961 and opened in 1964, making it one of Georgia's newest state colleges. The college transitioned from a community college into a four-year college and conferred its first baccalaureate degrees on May 7, 2011.
History
The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia established the college, originally known as Brunswick College, in 1961 with Brunswick and Glynn County citizens providing a $1 million bond issue for construction of buildings and purchase of land. The college opened in 1964 and shortly after changed its name to Brunswick Junior College in 1965. The college continued expanding the academic facilities on the college's campus through the late 1960s and 1970s. In 1972 the college added technical programs in addition to the traditional junior college programs and offered both associate programs in higher education and postsecondary technical and adult programs until 2008.
In 1986 the University System of Georgia Board of Regents created the Brunswick Center Consortium composed of Brunswick Junior College, Armstrong State University, and Georgia Southern University. As part of the consortium the two universities provided the college's students with opportunities to begin schooling at the community college and complete education in one of seven bachelors degree programs and seven graduate degree programs through one of the two universities. In 1988 the college name reverted to Brunswick College after the Board of Regents voted to drop "Junior" from the names of all state two-year colleges.
During the late 1980s and 1990s the college grew into a comprehensive community college, offering over 39 associate degrees, 21 vocational and technical certificate programs. The Board of Regents authorized the creation of the Camden Center location in Kingsland in response to growing populations in expanding population of Camden County. The college transformed the former Kingsland Elementary School into the extension location and opened the facility in January 1993. The center offers general education transfer and vocational/technical programs. In 1996 Brunswick College changed its name to Coastal Georgia Community College. In 2004 the Kingsland location moved into the new facility in Kingsland and became known as The Camden Center at The Lakes.
Expansion in early 2000s
In 2008 the college began transitioning from community college to a four-year college when it announced its 10-year strategic plan for the college. The plans include expansion of academic programs and infrastructure to accommodate an enrollment of more than 10,000. In addition to academic and physical expansion the expansion plans include addition student and residence life programs, as well as expanded athletics. That same year, the vocational and technical programs were transferred to Golden Isles Career Academy in Brunswick, Okefenokee Technical College in Waycross, and Altamaha Technical College in Jesup and the college changed its name to the College of Coastal Georgia. In 2009 the college began offering its first bachelor's degree programs in business administration, early childhood and special education, and middle school education began in fall 2009 and added a bachelor's degree in nursing in 2010. Shortly after the transition to a four-year college began in 2009 College of Coastal Georgia saw a peak enrollment of over 3,000 students.
The Miriam & Hugh Nunnally Health and Science Building opened in early 2011 at a cost of $15.8 million., followed in March 2011, by the announcement that the House Appropriations Committee of Georgia approved $7.6 million for a classroom and laboratory building, known as the Correll Teacher Education and Learning Center (CTELC). Opened in January 2013, the new building is connected to the Jones Science Building and Academic Commons North and the two older buildings were renovated as part of the project. CTELC includes space for teacher education classes and is located in close proximity to the Brunswick High School, located just off the campus, allowing education majors access to teaching practicum opportunities and helping to facilitate early college entrance for high school students. The building also has multiple high-tech classrooms for other subjects, and is home to the Office of Service Learning and the Writing Center.
On May 7, 2011, the college conferred the first ever baccalaureate degrees. In July 2011, the college opened the new $12 million student center that includes dining areas, the campus bookstore with a cafe, and a theater; as well as study and recreational areas for students. The college also opened a 352-bed residential building at the cost $14 million, as the college's first student housing structure in August 2011. The three-story building features suite-style dorms with individual bedrooms connected to a common living area. The opening of CTELC marked an end to the rapid growth on campus.
Campus
Coastal Georgia's main campus runs north and south, parallel to Altama Avenue. It consists of a pedestrian mall and a large outdoor square in the middle flanked by Mariner Way in the south, College Drive in the north, and a parking lot on the east side of campus. The Health and Science Building and the Gould Memorial Library lie on the south end while the Campus Center and the Academic Commons North on the north end. The most southern building is the Conference Center and the most northern is the Coffin Building and one of the two parking lots. The only buildings on the east side of campus, beyond the other of the two parking lots, are the Student Activity Center and two residence halls.
Brunswick Campus photos
Camden Center
The Regents authorized a satellite location to serve Camden County residents in 1992 and classes began in the former Kingsland Elementary School in 1993. A new permanent facility, the Camden Center, opened in 2004. The facility is 101,00 square feet contains; a 270 seat auditorium, classroom, and labs. The director of the Camden Center is Joseph Lodmell.
Academics
The College of Coastal Georgia is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and has had continuous accreditation since 1967. The college offers various majors and areas of study and confers associate degrees and bachelor's degrees from its four schools:
School of Arts and Science
School of Business and Public Management
School of Education and Teacher Preparation
School of Nursing and Health Sciences
Athletics
The Coastal Georgia athletic teams are called the Mariners. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Sun Conference (formerly known as the Florida Sun Conference (FSC) until after the 2007–08 school year) since the 2017–18 academic year. The Mariners previously competed in the Southern States Athletic Conference (SSAC; formerly known as Georgia–Alabama–Carolina Conference (GACC) until after the 2003–04 school year) from 2012–13 (after becoming a full member of the NAIA following the one-year provisional period) to 2016–17.
Coastal Georgia competes in eight intercollegiate varsity sports: Men's sports include basketball, golf and tennis; while women's sports include basketball, golf, softball, tennis and volleyball.
History
Until 2011 the college competed in the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and as a member of the Georgia Collegiate Athletic Association (GCAA). As part of the college's transformation from a two-year junior college to a four-year institution, Coastal Georgia applied for membership in the NAIA after exploring option to join the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The college also began expanding athletics in 2010 with the additions of men's and women's golf and tennis for the 2010–2011 academic year, in which both golf programs placed in the top-10 nationally in the NJCAA championship tournament.
Golf
The men's golf program won back-to-back NAIA national championships in 2014 and 2015.

The Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation is a non-governmental charitable organisation located in the Republic of Ireland. Its goal is to promote peace and reconciliation within and between communities through facilitated dialogue and learning. It was founded as a response to the Troubles and its aftermath.
It is housed in a complex of buildings that had many previous functions including barracks and reformatory school.
The Glencree Centre is devoted to peacebuilding and reconciliation in Ireland, North and South, and beyond. The programme work builds peace and fosters reconciliation through facilitated dialogue, peace education, and much more. The organisation was founded in 1974 as a response to violent conflict in Ireland, and in light of a conviction that non-violent solutions must be pursued to encourage reconciliation within and between communities. The organisation assists in the building of improbable relationships by providing the space for difficult conversations to take place.

Germ-Soma Differentiation is the process by which organisms develop distinct germline and somatic cells. The development of cell differentiation has been one of the critical aspects of the evolution of multicellularity and sexual reproduction in organisms. Multicellularity has evolved upwards of 25 times, and due to this there is great possibility that multiple factors have shaped the differentiation of cells. There are three general types of cells: germ cells, somatic cells, and stem cells. Germ cells lead to the production of gametes, while somatic cells perform all other functions within the body. Within the broad category of somatic cells, there is further specialization as cells become specified to certain tissues and functions. In addition, stem cell are undifferentiated cells which can develop into a specialized cell and are the earliest type of cell in a cell lineage. Due to the differentiation in function, somatic cells are found ony in multicellular organisms, as in unicellular ones the purposes of somatic and germ cells are consolidated in one cell.
All organisms with germ-soma differentiation are eukaryotic, and represent an added level of specialization to multicellular organisms. Pure germ-soma differentiation has developed in a select number of eukaryotes (called Weismannists), included in this category are vertebrates and arthropods- however land plants, green algae, red algae, brown algae, and fungi have partial differentiation. While a significant portion of organisms with germ-soma differentiation are asexual, this distinction has been imperative in the development of sexual reproduction; the specialization of certain cells into germ cells is fundamental for meiosis and recombination.
Weismann barrier
The strict division between somatic and germ cells is called the Weismann barrier, in which genetic information passed onto offspring is found only in germ cells. This occurs only in select organisms, however some without a Weismann barrier do present germ-soma differentiation. These organisms include land plants, many algaes, invertebrates, and fungi whose germ cells are derived from prior somatic cells as opposed to stem cells. The Weismann barrier is essential to the concept of an immortal germline, which passes down genetic information through designated germ cells.
Organisms with germ-soma differentiation but no Weismann barrier often reproduce through somatic embryogenesis.
Benefits and Detriments of Differentiation
There is no single widely accepted theory on the origins of somatic-germline differentiation, however of those that do exist many are based on the evolutionary advantage of differentiated multicellularity which has allowed it to survive. These theories include the development of colonial organization structures in which the division of labor between cells allowed for improvements in fitness.
The division of labor within multicellular organisms can offer significant advantages over unicellular counterparts. Division can allow organisms to become larger, or interact with the environments (and thus fill different niches) that increase fitness. In addition to internal benefits, there is evidence that these also improve defenses against predation. On the other hand, multicellularity comes with increased energy use devoted to maintaining homeostasis instead of to reproduction.
Dirty Work Hypothesis
One major theory as to the proliferation of organisms with cell differentiation is the dirty work hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that when an organism has differentiated cells, somatic cells are able to devote energy solely to maintaining homeostasis instead of reproduction while germ cells do the opposite. One reason proposed for the relative success of the "dirty work" system of organization is that it helps manage the detrimental effects of metabolic activity, and allow for more efficient energy distribution throughout an organism. The other major reason proposed is that it prevents metabolic activity within the cell from damaging genetic material. Said activity in mitochondria and chloroplasts creates mutagenic byproducts, so in organisms with differentiation where germ cells do not engage in metabolic activity the germline is not impacted.
Uncertainty
Due to the nature of research around the origin of life and multicellularity, it has been difficult to obtain a case study that is optimal for observing somatic-germline differentiation. One case that has been extensively studied is that of organisms in the Volvocacaeae family. Within volvocavea, there is much diversity in organizational structure, with some organisms being unicellular, colonial, or (arguably) multicellular. Within volvocine algae three genes have been identified as crucial to the development of soma cells which regulate coding for asymmetric division of cells, preventing reproductive development of soma cells, and preventing the development of somatic characteristics in germ cells (such as those meant for mobility or metabolic activity).

James Monroe (July 18, 1821 – July 6, 1898) was an American politician who served five terms as a U.S. Representative from Ohio from 1871 to 1881.
Early life
Born in Plainfield, Connecticut, Monroe attended the common schools and Plainfield Academy. He was graduated from Oberlin College in 1846. He pursued a postgraduate course in theology and was a professor at Oberlin College from 1849–1862.
Career
He served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives in 1856–1859. He served in the Ohio Senate from 1860–1862, during which time he was chosen to serve as president pro tempore from 1861 and 1862.
In October 1862, he resigned his seat in the Senate to accept the position of United States Consul in Rio de Janeiro and served from 1863 to 1869. Following that, he served for several months in 1869 as Chargé D'Affaires ad interim to Brazil.
Monroe was elected as a Republican to the Forty-second and to the four succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1871 – March 3, 1881). He served as chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor (Forty-third Congress) and was not a candidate for renomination.
Later career
After his terms in the House of Representatives, he returned to Oberlin College as a professor from 1883–1896.
Personal life
He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Maxwell (1825-1862), and later to Julia Finney (1837-1930). He had four children, including:
Mary Katherine Monroe (1851-1891)
Charles Edwin Monroe (1861-1947)
He died in Oberlin, Ohio, July 6, 1898 and was interred in Westwood Cemetery.
Legacy
The house in which Monroe and his wife Julia lived when they returned to Oberlin from his consul appointment in Rio de Janeiro is currently preserved as part of the Oberlin Heritage Center. The current interior of the house presents decor and information from the 1860s, 1870s, and 1880s, and uses Monroe's commitments to education and the abolition of slavery to highlight important events in the history of the city of Oberlin.

Milton Road is an arterial road in Brisbane, Australia. It is currently signed as State Route 32 for its entire length. Milton Road is a major corridor for traffic between the Brisbane central business district and the western suburbs. It carried an average of 50,954 vehicles per day between July and December 2014.
Milton Road's western end is at the northern terminus of the Western Freeway at the base of Mount Coot-tha in the suburb of Toowong and progresses in a north-easterly direction through the suburbs of Auchenflower and Milton before terminating at Petrie Terrace in Brisbane City. 250 metres west of Petrie Terrace is an interchange with the Hale Street expressway which allows access to and from the Inner City Bypass. Milton Road closely parallels the Ipswich railway line.
Attractions along Milton Road include the XXXX Brewery and Lang Park stadium, both in Milton. A pedestrian bridge crosses the road here, linking the stadium to Milton railway station.
The Toowong tram line ran along the entire length of Milton Road until 1962, when the Paddington tram depot fire compelled the closure of several tram lines. Part of the line was kept open to carry spectators to and from tennis matches at Frew Park in Milton for a short while after regular services ceased.
In 2015, the Legacy Way underground road tunnel was opened. The new toll road initially reduced traffic on Milton Road by 16%.
Major intersections
The entire road is in the Brisbane local government area.

David G. Messerschmitt (born May 21, 1945) is an engineer and professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences in the UC Berkeley College of Engineering. He retired from UC Berkeley in 2005. At present he is conducting research at Berkeley, is a visiting professor in the Software Business Laboratory at the Helsinki University of Technology, and is doing research on interstellar communications at the SETI Institute. Messerschmitt also serves on the Advisory Council of METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence).
Biography
His notable past research includes the advancement of digital transmission systems, including contributions that made digital telephony possible over the existing telephone network, the use of VLSI to realize functions in the telephone network, and VLSI architectures to solve signal processing challenges. His work has increasingly been devoted to software. In 1984 Messerschmitt wrote Blosim, a software-based block diagram simulation system for digital signal processing simulations. He also contributed to a successor to Blosim called Ptolemy, which is still being actively developed and used. When the UC Berkeley School of Information was created he co-founded courses on network applications and strategic technology, and later served as interim dean of the school. His research interests and curriculum development for the past decade have been largely devoted to the business of software and economics of the software industry.
Messerschmitt graduated with a B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of Colorado in 1967, and received his M.S. and Ph.D. in computer, information, and control engineering from the University of Michigan in 1971. He was a Bell Labs researcher until 1977, when he left to take an academic position at Berkeley.
In 1999 Messerschmitt received the IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal "for fundamental contributions to communications theory and practice, including VLSI for signal processing, and simulation and modeling software". He was elected a member of the US National Academy of Engineering in 1990 for contributions to telecommunication theory and practice and to engineering education.
In 2007 Messerschmitt co-founded the Software business community (SWBC) in cooperation with the Helsinki University of Technology.

Algeria competed at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 7 to 18 September 2016.
Disability classifications
Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of ten disability categories: impaired muscle power, impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency, leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and intellectual impairment. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.

Medallists
Algeria finished the Games ranked fourth among African nations for total gold medals won in Rio with 4. They were behind Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia. Algeria finished with 16 medals total.

The Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque () is a 16th-century Ottoman mosque located in Istanbul, Turkey.
The mosque is situated in Azapkapı neighborhood of Beyoğlu district in Istanbul. It is directly beside the Atatürk Bridge across the Golden Horn, but there was no bridge here at the time the mosque was built. It was designed by Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan (c. 1488/1490-1588) and built for the grand vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (in office 1565–1579) in 1578. It is one of the three mosques with the same name built by Mimar Sinan in Istanbul.

Target-controlled infusion (TCI) automates the dosing of intravenous drugs during surgery. After the anesthetist sets the desired parameters in a computer and presses the start button, the system controls the infusion pump, while being monitored by the anesthetist. TCI is as safe and effective as manually controlled infusion.
TCI can be sub-classified according to the target. The suffix 'e' as in TCIe indicates that the target is the effect site, in most cases, the central nervous system or brain. Alternatively, the suffix 'p' denotes plasma, indicating that the device implementing the TCI model is to target the blood plasma. There are important differences in relation to the time taken for effect site equilibration. Studies have demonstrated the clinical safety of the effect-site target model.
Popular TCI models exist for Propofol and the synthetic opioid Remifentanil. The models are based on pharmacokinetic studies and use software embedded in the infusion device. For propofol the Marsh and Schnider models are available and the Minto model is commonly used for remifentanil. In 2017, a project to emulate the TCI models in the python language was published on GitHub.
History
TCI has been used in clinical settings since 1996, initially with propofol.

Rêveuse bourgeoisie ("dreamy bourgeoisie") is a 1937 novel by the French writer Pierre Drieu La Rochelle. It tells the story of a declining middle-class family before and after World War I, told in five parts which span over three generations. The developments of the family, which was based on the author's own family, are paralleled to the overall decline of the French middle class around the same time. The novel was written at a time when Drieu La Rochelle was becoming increasingly more engaged in politics, but its themes and narrative are unpolitical and self-critical.
A first part of the novel was published in 1936 in the November issue of Nouvelle Revue Française. The finished book was published the year after by éditions Gallimard. Critics initially greeted it as the author's masterpiece, with some reservations about the change of pace toward the end of the novel.

Jack of Hearts (Jack Hart) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #22 (March 1976), and was created by writer Bill Mantlo and artist Keith Giffen. He starred in his own four-issue mini series and has been a regular character in the Iron Man comics as well as at one point being a regular in The Avengers comic book.
Jack of Hearts, real name Jack Hart, is the son of scientist Philip Hart (creator of "Zero Fluid") and an alien woman from the Contraxian race. As a young man Jack was doused in Zero Fluid and gained superpowers but was not in total control of his powers. In an attempt to control his powers, Jack of Hearts built a containment suit that resembled the Jack of Hearts playing card. The lack of control became a recurring theme with Jack of Hearts, including his stint in the Avengers where he had to spend 14 hours a day in a containment room to prevent self-destruction. When his powers became uncontrollable he chose to leave Earth, exploding in space without harming any innocent bystanders.
The return of Jack of Hearts and the explosion that killed Scott Lang was the launching point of the 2004-05 "Avengers Disassembled". The character was resurrected as part of one of the Marvel Zombies mini-series where Zero Energy reforms into Jack of Hearts, bringing the character back to life. The Zombies were later defeated with the help of Jack of Hearts.
Publication history
Jack of Hearts first appeared in the black & white magazine The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #22 (March 1976), and was created by writer Bill Mantlo and illustrator Keith Giffen. He was presented as an antagonist for the superhero White Tiger but his origin story in the following issue established him as a hero. His debut appearance in a color comic book was in The Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #214 (Aug. 1977) where he fights the Hulk. He later serves a brief stint as an ally and apprentice of Iron Man, becoming a regular cast member of the series during Mantlo's tenure as writer.
Jack has made various guest appearances in several books over the years, including Marvel Two-In-One, The Defenders, Marvel Premiere, (in a solo story meant to launch the character in his own series) ROM, and Marvel Team-Up, (which served as an intro to his 1984 mini-series) among others. He starred in his own self-titled, four issue limited series from Jan. to April 1984.
He was later made a regular in The Avengers by writer Kurt Busiek, who explained, "I first ran into Jack in The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu in an issue drawn by Gil Kane and Rico Rival. That great overcomplicated costume and the energy that Gil put into the storytelling hooked me, and I've been a fan ever since".
Fictional character biography
Early life
Jack Hart was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He is the son of Philip Hart, a scientist who created an energy source called "zero fluid", and Marie, an alien humanoid woman of the Contraxian race. After being exposed to a vat of zero fluid, Jack underwent a mutagenic change and gained the ability to project concussive energy from his body. After gaining these powers, Jack began his mission of vengeance against the Corporation that killed his father. This led to Jack fighting other superheroes such as the Sons of the Tiger and the Hulk. He also fought the White Tiger. Eventually, he killed Stryke, his father's killer.
Later, Jack mistakenly fought Iron Man. Being new to super-heroics, he asked Iron Man to take him on as an apprentice, which he did, to show him the ropes. Jack teamed with Iron Man, Nick Fury, Guardsman, Jasper Sitwell, Jean DeWolff, and the Wraith, and battled Midas. Jack was briefly turned to a golden living statue by Midas, and then freed from this golden state by Iron Man and Yellowjacket. Jack then aided Iron Man in fighting the Soviet Super-Soldiers on the moon. Jack aided Iron Man against the Rigellian Commander Arcturus. Jack later went off on his own, and fought Hemlock.
Being a Hero
Later, Jack moved past his mission of blind vengeance and became a true hero, working with various other superheroes such as the Defenders. Jack fought the Thing, who was under mental control of the Machinesmith. Jack Hart was then reunited with a college girlfriend named Marcy Kane (who was also a fellow graduate student of Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man). Marcy, a scientist, and S.H.I.E.L.D. offered to help find a cure for Jack's dangerous superpowers. Jack fought some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and his powers were temporarily dampened by Spider-Man. Marcy turned out to be a Contraxian agent sent to Earth to find Jack. It was at this time Jack learned of his half-Contraxian heritage. Marcy took Jack to Contraxia, where he discovered that his powers had become much stronger, and saved the home-world of his mother by reenergizing its dying sun. The Contraxians could not find a solution for Jack's unstable powers, and he left Contraxia to wander outer space in exile.
While wandering space he was captured by the Stranger. He later escaped captivity on the Stranger's planet. Jack fought Quasar during his return to Earth; however, Jack exploded when his containment suit was breached in battle with the Presence. Jack was retrieved from space, revived and mentally controlled by Moondragon, and he attacked Kismet. The damage to his armor led Jack to seek aid from the Silver Surfer, who found an alien armorer on Anvil who designed a new containment suit for Jack. Jack then battled Nebula and Geatar. Shortly after this adventure, Jack fell in love with the alien warrior woman known as Ganymede, though she did not return his feelings.
In an effort to save R-76, an outpost manned by the Rigellians, Jack of Hearts was injured in battle with the Servitors. Jack was rescued by a team of Avengers, and succeeded in convincing the Infinites to restore R-76. Subsequently, Jack and these Avengers were captured, first by the Shi'Ar, and then by the Ruul acting under the orders of the Supreme Intelligence. Jack and the Avengers eventually escaped to Earth and helped reverse a plan to have Earth consumed by Ego the Living Planet.
Jack's return to Earth happened during the period known as the Kang War, and Jack of Hearts was accepted as a member of the Avengers, becoming the fifty-second superhero to join the team, though the traditional welcoming ceremony for new Avengers were deferred given the nature of the crisis they faced. During his tenure, the Avengers teamed-up with the Justice League of America, and fought the Red Skull for unleashing a biological weapon at Mount Rushmore, killing many civilians.
Death
When his power levels began to increase beyond the capacity for his containment suit, Jack of Hearts chose to commit suicide rather than continue living in an isolated containment room for 14 hours a day. Jack took a child murderer who had abducted Cassandra Lang, the daughter of Scott Lang (the second Ant-Man), along with him when he exploded in space. With his uniform destroyed in the blast, the naked body of Jack of Hearts drifted deeper into space.
Avengers Disassembled
At the onset of the "Avengers Disassembled" event, Jack reappeared in uniform as what appeared to be a zombie just long enough to blow himself up, killing Scott Lang and destroying half of the Avengers Mansion. Jack's return was caused by the reality-shifting powers of the Scarlet Witch through methods that have remained ambiguous. Unlike his prior explosion in space, Jack's body was never recovered from the ruins.
Afterlife
During the adventures of Hercules in Hades, Jack can be seen playing slots to win a chance to return to the living. This is not the intended way the afterlife should operate, according to the characters. Jack wins, and excitedly declares that he is next for resurrection.
The Children's Crusade
Iron Lad (the young Kang the Conqueror) transports the Young Avengers and the amnesiac Wanda, no longer the Scarlet Witch, back to the onset of the "Avengers Disassembled" when Jack had been used as a weapon to destroy the Avengers. While there they discovered that he was actually the real Jack of Hearts, summoned by Scarlet Witch. Undead and quite miserable, Jack pleads with Wanda not to go through with her monstrous plan, unaware that he is facing a different Wanda. The pity of this and the horror of seeing Jack blow himself up, shocks Wanda into recovering her memory—and therefore her powers. As an unexpected side effect, the life of Scott Lang is also saved, as the Young Avengers take Scott back to the future with them when they depart, thus saving his life while preserving the timeline as everyone still 'saw' him 'die' in the explosion. Jack's last words before exploding were "I'm sorry".
Marvel Zombies Supreme and resurrection
Jack Hart returned to life once more in the second issue of the Marvel Zombies Supreme mini-series. While defending scientists at Project Pegasus, (which has been besieged by zombiefied clones of the Squadron Supreme) a team of special operatives led by Jill Harper and the superhero known as Battlestar came across a source of zero-point energy which Harper believed could help them stop the zombies. The zero-point energy unexpectedly reformed itself into corporeal form as Jack, who returned to life wearing his original suit for unexplained reasons. Harper managed to revive Jack, who was temporarily amnesiac and fainting from the stress of becoming human again. Although initially weakened, Jack quickly regained control of his powers and assessed the situation. Using his powers, Jack destroyed the zombies and saved Harper's life after she became infected with the zombie virus. Afterwards, the two shared a romantic kiss.
Powers and abilities
Jack Hart's superhuman powers are as a result of the mutagenic effect of his father's "Zero Fluid", combined with the alien genes from his Contraxian mother. He has superhuman stamina and durability. Jack of Hearts also has the ability to generate "zero energy" within his body and project it as concussive force or intense heat or as a propellant to fly. Jack is sometimes unable to exert complete control over his energies, however. For a short time after restarting Contraxia's sun, he uncontrollably radiated enough heat to melt one of Contraxia's polar ice caps. He can survive unprotected in space. Jack of Hearts's brain has incorporated the artificial intelligence of a computerized device called the Scanalyzer, enabling him to think with the speed of a computer and store and retrieve information with a computer-like capacity and efficiency.
The left half of Jack of Hearts' body has turned purplish-black from direct exposure to "Zero Fluid". Jack of Hearts' left eye has an opaque white membrane covering the entire pupil. These mutations were not solely caused by exposure to the "Zero Fluid", but are actually aspects of his half-Contraxian genetics brought to the fore, as Contraxians naturally have such appearances.
Jack originally wore a suit of armor crafted in medieval Europe. His second suit of armor was designed by Torval, and made from alien materials designed to contain the zero energy his body generates. His original suit of armor was later restored and upgraded by Moondragon after Jack was rescued from space by the Avengers and thus leading to his connection with the team.
Jack is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, has had some S.H.I.E.L.D. combat training, and is a talented poet.
In other media
In the Silver Surfer TV series, Jack of Hearts is seen as part of Nebula's crew.

The League of the Physically Handicapped was an early 20th century disability rights organization in New York City. It was formed in May 1935 to protest discrimination by the Works Progress Administration (WPA).
The Home Relief Bureau of New York City stamped applications by disabled applicants with "PH", which stood for "physically handicapped". Marked as "unemployable", they were denied access to WPA-created jobs. To protest this, members of the League held a sit-in at that Home Relief Bureau for nine days beginning on May 29, 1935, and a weekend sit-in at the WPA headquarters, also in New York City, in June 1935. These actions eventually led to the creation of 1,500 jobs for physically disabled workers in New York City in 1936. The league had dissolved by 1938.

The North Channel naval duel was a single-ship action between the United States Continental Navy sloop of war Ranger (Captain John Paul Jones) and the British Royal Navy sloop of war Drake (Captain George Burdon) on the evening of 24 April 1778. Fought in the North Channel, separating Ireland from Scotland, it was the first American naval success within Atlantic waters, and also very nearly the only American naval victory in the Revolutionary War achieved without an overwhelming superiority of force. The action was one of a series of actions by Jones that brought the American War of Independence to British waters.
Background
Even before the official entry of other nations, the American Revolutionary War was by no means confined to American soil; naval operations, by both the Continental Navy and privateers, ranged across the Atlantic. In 1777, American captains such as Lambert Wickes, Gustavus Conyngham, and William Day had been making raids into British waters and capturing merchant ships, which they took into French ports, even though France was officially neutral. Captain Day had even been accorded a gun salute by the French admiral at Brest.
Encouraged by such successes, and even more so by the American victory at the Battle of Saratoga that autumn, France signed two treaties with America in February 1778, but stopped just short of declaring war on Britain. The risk of a French attack forced the Royal Navy to concentrate its forces in the English Channel (La Manche), leaving other areas vulnerable.
Wickes and Day had shown that, despite the narrowness of St. George's Channel and the North Channel, it was possible for single ships or very small squadrons to get into the Irish Sea, and create havoc among the many vessels which traded between Great Britain and Ireland. John Paul Jones, on his first return to British waters as an enemy, had a more ambitious plan: to teach the British people that their government's policies in America, such as the burning of ports, could be turned back against them.
The Ranger mission
With a single small Continental Navy sloop of war, the Ranger, Jones sailed from Brest on 10 April 1778, and headed for the coasts of the Solway Firth, where he had first learned to sail. Following an unsuccessful attempt to raid the port of Whitehaven in Cumberland, on the night of 17–18 April, he harassed shipping in the North Channel; then on the night of 20–21 April Ranger entered Belfast Lough in northern Ireland, with the intention of seizing a Royal Navy ship moored off Carrickfergus, HMS Drake. Unsuccessful, he returned to Whitehaven, and achieved another objective, landing a large party at the harbour on the night of 22–23 April, and setting fire to a merchant ship. This raid was followed within hours by another, at the Scottish seashore mansion of the Earl of Selkirk, near Kirkcudbright. Even as the news of those deeds was racing to alert Britain's defences, Ranger was on the way back to Carrickfergus.
24 April 1778
Preparations for combat
John Paul Jones's crew had been recruited by being offered the opportunity to "make their Fortunes", a goal that could be achieved by privateering operations against British merchant ships. But more British merchant ships had been sunk on the mission than captured, to avoid diverting crew members to sailing the prizes to France. The crew blamed Jones for what appeared to be a tactical error that allowed a British customs vessel to escape after being fired on by Ranger. Now he was intent on capturing a Royal Navy ship from its moorings, although it carried no cargo that could be sold for a handsome profit to his crew's benefit. The account of events just after dawn on 24 April that Jones published a few years later may not be greatly exaggerated: "I ran a great risk of being killed or thrown in the sea". The crew was reluctant, and the state of the wind and tide would have made it difficult to enter the harbour. But it soon appeared that they might not have to visit Carrickfergus after all, as Drake was preparing to leave port, which revived the Americans' flagging spirits.
In fact, Drake had been preparing for action since the previous visit by Ranger, taking on volunteers from the Carrickfergus area to boost the crew from 100 to about 160, many of them landsmen who were to be used only for close-quarters combat, although there was a shortage of ammunition. Absent from the ship's company at this crucial time were the gunner, master's mate, boatswain, and lieutenant. The aging captain, George Burdon, was later reported to have been in poor health himself. Drake got under way about 8am, but with wind and tide against it, made little progress. After an hour or so a boat was therefore sent to get a closer look at the intruder. Jones opted to try a slight variant of the plan which had failed to capture the customs vessel a few days earlier; hiding most of the crew and the big guns. This time it worked; the crew of the reconnaissance boat was captured, and this success raised the morale of the Americans. One of the prisoners revealed the large number of volunteers who had gone aboard Drake.
About 1pm, as Drake moved sluggishly out across Belfast Lough, a small boat came out to her, carrying another volunteer, Royal Navy Lieutenant William Dobbs, a local man who had just gotten married. According to Drake pilot he brought with him a copy of an express letter from Whitehaven, explaining the full details of the mystery ship (Jones states in his official report that the news from Whitehaven had arrived the previous evening and was known to his morning captives). With the wind and tide more favourable in the afternoon, Ranger moved slowly back out of the Lough into the North Channel, making sure never to get too far ahead of Drake. Finally, about 6pm, the two enemies were within hailing distance. Jones had the American naval colours flying, and Lieut. Dobbs' formal inquiry as to the ship's identity was answered with absolute truth.
The North Channel naval duel was in some respects a small-scale dress-rehearsal, in reverse, for Jones's 1779 battle with . Drake had been built as a merchant ship with defensive capability, and bought by the Royal Navy to help fill the gap left when many ships had to be sent to America; even the 20 four-pound guns were not official Navy issue, but her armament as a merchant vessel. The hull was the wrong shape for rapid battle manoeuvres, and not designed to resist cannon fire. Ranger had been built as a fighting ship, and modified by Jones for maximum efficiency: for example, although there were ports for 20 guns, he found it safest to install only 18 six-pound guns. That made for a total broadside weight of 54 pounds, slightly more than Drake 40 pounds total. But those dozens of Irish volunteers meant that if Drake could grapple and board Ranger the Americans would be in trouble.
Battle
The formalities completed, Ranger turned sharply and fired a broadside at the following Drake. The British were unable to reply immediately; when they did, they found they had a serious problem. With full charges of powder, the four-pounders were unstable, and tended to tip forward; in the case of the two pairs of guns at the rear of the ship, most subject to the rise and fall with the waves, this meant that they could skid almost anywhere as they were fired, presenting grave danger to the gun crews. In Navy records, Drake armament had been listed as only 16 guns, suggesting that the rearmost guns had been left aboard just for show. The ship's gunner may well have known of these problems, and perhaps the gunner's mate too, but neither was aboard the Drake anymore (the mate having been captured in the reconnaissance mission, and the gunner being ill at Portsmouth).
After a few more broadsides, further problems emerged. Shrapnel from Ranger third broadside hit Lieut. Dobbs in the head, putting him out of action. Conditions on Drake gun deck were so unpredictable that the "powder monkeys"—the boys who brought charges of gunpowder up for the great guns, in fire-resistant boxes—eventually became reluctant to do their duty. Twice the ship's master had to go below to urge the acting gunner to be more efficient in supplying the powder, when opportunities for broadsides were missed. Another problem was that the "slow matches" which were used to fire the guns kept falling into their fire-safety tubs and going out. The four-pound guns could not penetrate Ranger toughened hull anyway, so Drake tried copying the technique the Americans had been using from the start: they aimed at the masts, sails and rigging, in order to slow the opponent down.
The combatants were very close together, but never close enough for grappling, probably because Captain Jones knew of the extra men hidden below decks on Drake. As well as the great guns, both sides were firing small arms at each other, and here, too, Drake was at a disadvantage. The ship's magazine lacked cartridge paper; and when the musketeers ran out of cartridges, they had to laboriously load their guns by pouring in the right amount of powder, then putting in the shot. Musket balls were passed round in the armourer's hat, and two powder horns were shared between all the men on duty. With the other side much better organised, such inefficiency meant the difference between life and death. Drake killed just one of Jones's crew, Lieutenant Samuel Wallingford, by musket fire; another two—who were firing from positions in the mast tops—died as the by-product of a broadside. Five of Drake crew were killed, including, just under an hour into the fight, Captain Burdon himself, struck in the head by a musket ball. With both the captain and lieutenant out of action, command of Drake passed to the master, John Walsh.
By that time, Drake sails and rigging had been reduced to tatters by Ranger broadsides, and even the masts and yardarms were seriously damaged; in the light wind, the sloop was more or less immobilised, not even able to turn to aim a broadside. Unable to load fast enough, the small-arms fighters had retreated to cover, so only about a dozen people were left on Drake main deck. A few minutes after the captain died, the two remaining petty officers on deck went to the master and advised him that they should strike their colours and surrender; after further consultation, he agreed. The colours had already been shot away, so Mr. Walsh had to shout and wave his hat instead. According to John Paul Jones's records, the duel lasted one hour and five minutes.
Aftermath
Thirty-five men were sent from Ranger to Drake to take charge and assess the damage; and the next three days were spent making repairs, while moving slowly north-westward between Ireland and Scotland. A cargo brig which came too close was captured, and used as extra accommodations. Six Irish fisherman who had been captured on the first Carrickfergus expedition were allowed to take a boat and go home, taking with them three sick Irish sailors, a present of sails from Drake, and money from Jones. On their return they reported the concern Jones was showing for Lieut. Dobbs, who remained gravely ill. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy had sent out some proper warships in pursuit. Despite Drake lameness, they never caught a glimpse of the slowly escaping Americans. The only real trouble Jones had been with his Lieutenant, Thomas Simpson, who had command of the Drake and at one point on the voyage sailed out of sight.
The news of the battle reached France much faster than Jones did, and the Americans were welcomed as heroes. As for the British, they had learned their lesson well—the Royal Navy could not defend British shipping, nor British coasts, nor even its own fighting vessels against American raiders. Militia regiments were hastily redeployed to coastal areas; seaports equipped themselves with artillery to defend themselves against further raids; and the gentry banded together in volunteer battalions as a last line of defence. Thenceforward, the press paid very close attention to every move John Paul Jones made; struggling to reconcile the malicious rumours of his murders and piracy with the evidence of his chivalrous and far from bloodthirsty behaviour on the Ranger mission (back in France, he wrote kind and thoughtful letters to the Earl of Selkirk, and to the family of Lieut. Dobbs, who had died within a couple of days).
John Paul Jones had gone from being an obscurity to international fame. The naval duel in the North Channel was the unequivocally triumphant climax to his remarkable mission, which demonstrated that the world's most powerful nation was as vulnerable to attack as any other. The press reports of his preparations for his next mission created a climate of fear and uncertainty which helped turn his return visit in 1779 into his best-remembered achievement.

Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector is a 2006 American comedy film starring American stand-up comedian Larry the Cable Guy. Larry, a municipal restaurant health inspector, is assigned a new rookie partner after recklessly closing restaurants for code violations, Amy Butlin (Iris Bahr), by his boss, Bart Tatlock (Tom Wilson). Together, Larry and Amy work to solve a series of food poisonings at four-star restaurants.
Plot
Larry is a big city health inspector with questionable practices and his own way of doing things. Larry's boss, Bart Tatlock, in an attempt to acquire information on his activities in order to get him fired, assigns Larry a new partner, Amy Butlin, a by-the-book professional who takes the job seriously. She tries to learn the ropes of health inspection while putting up with Larry and his personality as well as getting the information Tatlock needs to get Larry fired.
As Larry and Amy do their job as city health inspection team, a serial criminal is poisoning four-star restaurants. Trying to avert a panic, and keep the matter of the poisonings under control, Tatlock puts his best people on the job, and not Larry. Larry and Amy are called in on one of the poisonings, but Tatlock forbids them from working on such an important case. Larry and Amy continue to inspect lower-profile restaurants, but the mammophilic Mayor Maurice T. Gunn is tricked into assigning Larry and Amy to the more important poison case, much to Larry and Amy's enthusiasm. Larry and Amy go undercover at one of the restaurants, and obtain a tape recording of a conversation between the Mayor Gunn and Chef Leon, in which the chef clarifies Gunn's request that the food being prepared by Chef Leon be poisoned.
Larry and Amy interrupt the mayor during an interview with their evidence, but the mayor explains that Chef Leon was reacting to the mayor's instruction to put French's mustard on the Gunn's chicken piccata, an act that the insulted Chef Leon viewed as a metaphorical act of "poisoning" to his life's work. When Larry speaks to Chef Leon over the phone, Chef Leon corroborates this interpretation. As a result, Tatlock fires Larry.
Despondent, Larry visits his old friend Big Shug, but ends up alienating him as well. Heading over to his romantic interest, Jane's house, Larry sees she and her mother (Lisa Lampanelli) are enjoying a friendly social visit by the mayor. Feeling as if his life has hit rock bottom, Larry resolves to solve the poisoning crimes. He confronts Mayor Gunn, who reveals that Lily Micelli, the owner of Micelli's restaurant, had him make sure that Larry was assigned to the poisonings case. Larry and Amy realize that Micelli did this so to ensure that case was investigated incompetently, as she is the one behind the poisonings. At a taping of the television cook-off show, Top Chef, Larry and Amy expose Micelli's culpability and arrest her, and are vindicated.

The film earned $15,680,099 at the American box office.
The film was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 5% based on reviews from 39 critics. The website's consensus states: "An aggressively lowbrow vehicle for its titular star, this gross-out comedy fails to "git-r-done." On Metacritic it has a score of 21% based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating "Generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade "B+" on an A+ to F scale.
Rotten Tomatoes ranked Larry The Cable Guy: Health Inspector #85 on its "The 100 Worst Reviewed Films of All Time: 2000-2009" list.
Joe Leydon of Variety wrote: "Entirely comfortable as the crude character he has honed in countless stand-up routines and TV appearances, Larry the Cable Guy sustains a level of likeability that enables him to get away with a lot more than he has any right to. But, he remains very much an acquired taste."
J. R. Jones of the Chicago Reader wrote: "Though some of his one-liners are pretty good, his shtick can't sustain this dutifully scripted comedy."
Lou Lumenick of the New York Post called it "Virtually unwatchable and laugh-free."
Awards
The film was nominated for one Golden Raspberry Award, Larry the Cable Guy was nominated in the "Worst Actor" category.

The Hill sphere of an astronomical body is the region in which it dominates the attraction of satellites. To be retained by a planet, a moon must have an orbit that lies within the planet's Hill sphere. That moon would, in turn, have a Hill sphere of its own. Any object within that distance would tend to become a satellite of the moon, rather than of the planet itself. One simple view of the extent of the Solar System is the Hill sphere of the Sun with respect to local stars and the galactic nucleus.
In more precise terms, the Hill sphere approximates the gravitational sphere of influence of a smaller body in the face of perturbations from a more massive body. It was defined by the American astronomer George William Hill, based on the work of the French astronomer Édouard Roche.
In the example to the right, the Earth's Hill sphere extends between the Lagrange points and , which lie along the line of centers of the two bodies. The region of influence of the smaller body is shortest in that direction, and so it acts as the limiting factor for the size of the Hill sphere. Beyond that distance, a third object in orbit around the small object would spend at least part of its orbit outside the Hill sphere, and would be progressively perturbed by the tidal forces of the central body (e.g. the Sun), eventually ending up orbiting the latter.
For any given energy of the third object (considered to have a negligible mass) there is a zero-velocity surface in space which cannot be passed. This is a contour of the Jacobi integral. When the energy is low, the zero-velocity surface surrounds the second body (the smaller of the two) completely, which means the third body cannot escape. At higher energy, there will be one or more gaps or bottlenecks by which the third object may escape the second object and go into orbit around the first object. If the energy is right at the border between these two cases, then the third object cannot escape, but the zero-velocity surface confining it touches a larger zero-velocity surface around the first object at one of the nearby Lagrange points (forming a cone-like point there). At the opposite side of the planet it gets close to the other Lagrange point. This limiting zero-velocity surface around the second object is basically its Hill "sphere".
Formula and examples
If the mass of the smaller body (e.g. the Earth) is , and it orbits a heavier body (e.g. the Sun) of mass with a semi-major axis and an eccentricity of , then the radius of the Hill sphere of the smaller body, calculated at the pericenter, is approximately
When eccentricity is negligible (the most favourable case for orbital stability), this becomes
In the Earth-Sun example, the Earth (5.97×1024 kg) orbits the Sun (1.99×1030 kg) at a distance of 149.6 million km, or one astronomical unit (AU). The Hill sphere for Earth thus extends out to about 1.5 million km (0.01 AU). The Moon's orbit, at a distance of 0.384 million km from Earth, is comfortably within the gravitational sphere of influence of Earth and it is therefore not at risk of being pulled into an independent orbit around the Sun. All stable satellites of the Earth (those within the Earth's Hill sphere) must have an orbital period shorter than seven months.
The previous (eccentricity-ignoring) formula can be re-stated as follows:
This expresses the relation in terms of the volume of the Hill sphere compared with the volume of the second body's orbit around the first; specifically, the ratio of the masses is three times the ratio of the volume of these two spheres.
Derivation
The expression for the Hill radius can be found by equating gravitational and centrifugal forces acting on a test particle (of mass much smaller than ) orbiting the secondary body. Assume that the distance between masses and is , and that the test particle is orbiting at a distance from the secondary. When the test particle is on the line connecting the primary and the secondary body, the force balance requires that
where is the gravitational constant and is the (Keplerian) angular velocity of the secondary about the primary (assuming that ). The above equation can also be written as
which, through a binomial expansion to leading order in , can be written as
Hence, the relation stated above
If the orbit of the secondary about the primary is elliptical, the Hill radius is maximum at the apocenter, where is largest, and minimum at the pericenter of the orbit. Therefore, for purposes of stability of test particles (for example, of small satellites), the Hill radius at the pericenter distance needs to be considered.
To leading order in , the Hill radius above also represents the distance of the Lagrangian point L1 from the secondary.
A quick way of estimating the radius of the Hill sphere comes from replacing mass with density in the above equation:
where and are the average densities of the primary and secondary bodies, and and are their radii. The second approximation is justified by the fact that, for most cases in the Solar System, happens to be close to one. (The Earth–Moon system is the largest exception, and this approximation is within 20% for most of Saturn's satellites.) This is also convenient, because many planetary astronomers work in and remember distances in units of planetary radii.
True region of stability
The Hill sphere is only an approximation, and other forces (such as radiation pressure or the Yarkovsky effect) can eventually perturb an object out of the sphere. This third object should also be of small enough mass that it introduces no additional complications through its own gravity. Detailed numerical calculations show that orbits at or just within the Hill sphere are not stable in the long term; it appears that stable satellite orbits exist only inside 1/2 to 1/3 of the Hill radius. The region of stability for retrograde orbits at a large distance from the primary is larger than the region for prograde orbits at a large distance from the primary. This was thought to explain the preponderance of retrograde moons around Jupiter; however, Saturn has a more even mix of retrograde/prograde moons so the reasons are more complicated.
Further examples
An astronaut could not have orbited the Space Shuttle (with mass of 104 tonnes), where the orbit was 300 km above the Earth, because its Hill sphere at that altitude was only 120 cm in radius, much smaller than the shuttle itself. A sphere of this size and mass would be denser than lead. In fact, in any low Earth orbit, a spherical body must be more dense than lead in order to fit inside its own Hill sphere, or else it will be incapable of supporting an orbit. Satellites further out in geostationary orbit, however, would only need to be more than 6% of the density of water to fit inside their own Hill sphere.
Within the Solar System, the planet with the largest Hill radius is Neptune, with 116 million km, or 0.775 au; its great distance from the Sun amply compensates for its small mass relative to Jupiter (whose own Hill radius measures 53 million km). An asteroid from the asteroid belt will have a Hill sphere that can reach 220,000 km (for 1 Ceres), diminishing rapidly with decreasing mass. The Hill sphere of 66391 Moshup, a Mercury-crossing asteroid that has a moon (named Squannit), measures 22 km in radius.
A typical extrasolar "hot Jupiter", HD 209458 b, has a Hill sphere radius of 593,000 km, about eight times its physical radius of approx 71,000 km. Even the smallest close-in extrasolar planet, CoRoT-7b, still has a Hill sphere radius (61,000 km), six times its physical radius (approx 10,000 km). Therefore, these planets could have small moons close in, although not within their respective Roche limits.

The following table and logarithmic plot show the radius of the Hill spheres of some bodies of the Solar System calculated with the first formula stated above (including orbital eccentricity), using values obtained from the JPL DE405 ephemeris and from the NASA Solar System Exploration website.

Gaius Sulpicius Paterculus served as a consul to the Roman Republic in 258 BC, together with Aulus Atilius Calatinus. He succeeded Lucius Cornelius Scipio who was the second consul of 259.
Punic War
Gaius Sulpicius Paterculus served as a commander in the First Punic War in Sicily, and the Roman victory at the Battle of Sulci is credited to him. An account of his campaign stated that the Roman legions in Sicily were achieving very little until his arrival together with the Calatinus. The consuls advanced towards the Carthaginian army in its winter quarters in Panormus and deployed the entire Roman army close to the city. The enemy refused to fight so the Romans turned towards the town of Hippana, Myttistratum, Camarina, Enna and other Carthaginian strongholds, which they all captured.
Gaius Sulpicius Paterculus also led several successful attacks on the African coast. He was awarded a Roman triumph "over the Carthaginians and Sardinia".

Wenkchemna Peak is located on the border of Alberta and British Columbia. It was named in 1894 by Samuel E. S. Allen.
Wenkchemna is the 10th peak in The Valley of the Ten Peaks, as they are normally numbered (left to right as seen from Moraine Lake). It is an extension into the valley of the ridge formed by Mount Hungabee and Ringrose Peaks.
Geology
Wenkchemna Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.
Climate
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Wenkchemna Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

Career
Built on a design by François Coulomb, Bizarre entered service in 1753. She took part in the Seven Years' War, notably attacking an English convoy off Ireland on 10 October 1758, along with the 28-gun corvette Mignonne. Together they captured 44 merchantmen as well as the convoy's escort .
In 1777, she was under Louis Augustin de Monteclerc.
She was activated for the American Revolutionary War under Captain La Landelle-Roscanvec and appointed to Suffren's squadron in the Indian Ocean. She was present at the Battle of Negapatam in 1782, although she did not take part in the action. She was also at the Battle of Trincomalee.

The Strong Egypt Party () is an Egyptian centrist political party founded in 2012 by former presidential candidate Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh.
History
The Strong Egypt Party was established in July 2012 by former Muslim Brotherhood member and 2012 presidential candidate Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh. On 31 October 2012, the party was officially inaugurated by Aboul Fotouh and co-founders Mokhtar Nouh and Rabab El-Mahdi in front of hundreds of supporters at the Supreme Court in Cairo.
On 10 December 2012, Aboul Fotouh announced that the party is calling on Egyptians to vote "no" in the 2012 constitutional referendum. In a videotaped statement, he said that there were three main reasons why Egyptians should reject the draft: first, a weakness in achieving social justice, second, the special status given to the military establishment and the provision for military trials of civilians, and third, the almost unchanged authorities of the president.
On 3 December 2013, the party announced that it will oppose the constitution that will be voted on in the 2014 constitutional referendum. In a press statement, party leader Aboul Fotouh said that the party rejected the draft for the same reasons as the 2012 constitution: it failed to promote social justice and gave too much power to the president. He asserted that the draft did not fulfill the goals of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, and he also criticised that it made the military "a state above the state". A court case was brought forth to dissolve the party, though the Alexandria Urgent Matters Court ruled on 26 November 2014 that it lacked jurisdiction.
The Strong Egypt Party boycotted the parliamentary elections on 17 October 2015.
Basic tenets
The party describes itself as an economically progressive and socially moderate political group. However, it does not endorse the politics of international loans, believing that it is not the solution to the economic problems of Egypt.
Cooperation with other parties and movements
In July 2013, following the military coup against President Morsi, members of the Strong Egypt Party participated in the Third Square movement, which was created by liberal, leftist and moderate Islamist activists who reject both the Muslim Brotherhood and military rule.
In September 2013, members of the party were amongst the founders of the Road of the Revolution Front, an alliance of activists from different political backgrounds that aims to achieve the goals of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 of bread, freedom and social justice.
Lawsuit against Islamic parties
The Strong Egypt Party is one of the eleven Islamic parties targeted by a lawsuit in November 2014, when an organization named Popular Front for opposing the Brotherhoodization of Egypt sought to dissolve all political parties established "on a religious basis." The Alexandria Urgent Matters Court however ruled on 26 November 2014 that it lacked jurisdiction.

Film, Film, Film (Russian: Фильм, фильм, фильм) is a 1968 Soviet satirical animated short film directed by Fyodor Khitruk.
Made as a parody of the Soviet movie industry, this nearly-silent pantomime tells a story of a film crew that faces various problems during the filmmaking process, from writing a screenplay, to pre-production (which includes dealing with bureaucratic officials), to the actual shooting of the movie.
Plot
A screenwriter tries to write a script with a typewriter, but tears it up several times. In a fit of desperation, he prepares to commit suicide (implied by his cigarette smoke forming a noose), but a winged Muse descends to him. He frantically completes the script before passing out. His friend, a film director, walks in and, after reading the script, wakes him up, enthusiastically praises him and offers to pitch the script to multiple production companies.
The two pitch the script to the companies in a labyrinthine office building, where the script gets stamped with various criticisms. The two shorten the text, then add the text back, before the director finally manages to approve the script behind the door with the grandest design. The film director goes to the film studio and begins to gather the film crew: the art director, the cinematographer, the composer, the sound engineer, the assistant director, the actors, workers, and others, while the screenwriter stays behind in the central city.
Filming begins on the film, a war epic. The director and crew encounter numerous difficulties: the necessary props are absent, the weather is bad, the child actor is disobedient, and the production repeatedly runs over budget. To top it off, near the end of shooting, the authorities reject the end of the film, the protagonist's violent death, as too gloomy. The ending is urgently rewritten and reshot. At the premiere, after a tense wait where the director walks up the walls and screenwriter contemplates suicide again, the entire film crew, hearing applause from the audience, weeps with happiness.
The movie begins and ends with a song: "So many jobs that call, // but film is best of all. // Once you're involved with it // Happiness guaranteed".

Other facts
According to Khitruk, the cartoon character of the film director was inspired by Grigori Roshal and not by Sergei Eisenstein as most people think.
The main theme was performed by Sokol, the first Soviet rock band, although they were listed as "VIA Sokol" in the credits. Vocals were provided by Vyacheslav Dobrynin, Valentin Vitebskiy and Leonid Berger of the VIA Orphey who were not mentioned in the credits at all.

() is a mountain in the Moravian-Silesian Beskids mountain range, Moravian-Silesian Region, Czech Republic.
Its top is the tripoint of the municipalities of Milíkov, Košařiska, and Dolní Lomná. Several tourist routes lead to Kozubová from these villages and from Bocanovice.
Etymology
According to Jan Korzenny, regional historian from Dolní Lomná, the name of the mountain is derived from surname Kozub. It is said to be a sheep shepherd who led his sheep on the slopes of this mountain.
Tourism
In 1937, a Chapel of Saint Anne was built there. Beskid sandstone was used as a construction material. Main initiator of the building was priest Rudolf Płoszek from Hnojník. It was consecrated on 7 August 1937. More than 10,000 people took part in the event. Since 1937, a church fair occurs here every year at the end of July around the Feast of Saint Anne day. Prominent feature of the chapel is a tower, serving as a lookout tower during the church fair. Church masses occur only several times a year. At the end of the 1990s, it was reconstructed.
There is a mountain hut on Kozubová. Original wooden hut was built in July 1928-August 1929 on the initiative of Polskie Towarzystwo Turystyczne "Beskid Śląski" (Polish Touristic Society "Silesian Beskids") of the Polish minority in Czechoslovakia. The project was prepared by architect Edward Dawid. Mountain hut was opened 8 September 1929. During World War II it served mostly to the Hitler Youth, and at the end of war to Wehrmacht units who conducted operations against partisans from the area. The building burnt to the ground on 9 February 1973. Precise investigation evaluated reason of the fire. It was self-ignition of a balk near the chimney. In 1986 new, current hut was built on its place; its architectonic character is, however, completely different from the style of the original one.

Gutter Rainbows is the fourth studio album by American hip hop artist Talib Kweli. The album was released on January 25, 2011, by Blacksmith Music and Javotti Media. The album was originally intended to be released in only a digital format. However, on November 16, 2010, it was announced that Duck Down Records would step in to see the album got a CD release. This included an import edition and a special edition with extras.
Reception
Critical response
Gutter Rainbows was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. The album holds a score of 71 out of 100 from Metacritic based on "generally favorable reviews". HipHopDX gave it a score of three out of five and called it "a fairly easy spin, and can go into the listener's steady rotation in a pinch. That being said, this feels a bit like a subdued version of Eardrum." BBC Music gave it a favorable review and said, "This is an odd thing to say, given the dumbness of so many contemporary rap songs--is that Kweli tries to cram too much awareness into his lines at the expense of rhymes and flow. But trying a little too hard to find enlightenment can be forgiven when it comes from within a genre that often tips bravado ahead of insight." However, some reviews are very average or mixed: URB gave it three stars out of five and said, "Talib seems to be coasting just a bit on this cut-and-paste session. As in, from a pure musical standpoint, outside of a few of repeat-worthy tracks, Gutter Rainbows is no cure for your current cabin fever." No Ripcord gave it a score of six stars out of ten and said that it "hovers between a mainstream and an indie vibe, embracing neither and potentially isolating both audiences." Tiny Mix Tapes gave it a score of two stars out of five and said, "Kweli still has an ear for beats, and despite some particular low points here, his lyrics were always overshadowed by his flow, which is as sharp as ever."
Commercial performance
In its first week, the album sold 13,900 copies in the United States. In the first two weeks after its release, the album sold a total of 19,000 copies in the United States.

Rugby São Carlos, is a Brazilian rugby team based in São Carlos, established in 2000.
History
The first rugby team in São Carlos appeared in 1990, where some foreign fans of the sport arrived in the city. Finding new partners, they formed the first team called São Carlos Rugby Club. However, over the years interest fell and this team ceased to exist in the mid 1990s.
In 2000, again with the arrival of new fans of the sport in the city and some remnants of the first era, they created a new team now called the Rugby São Carlos, established as a sports association. The club has won the Campeonato Paulista do Interior, also known as Caipirão (state league) in 2006.
The Rugby São Carlos also contests rugby sevens and beach rugby tournaments.

The 2011 International Rules Series (officially the 2011 Toyota International Rules Series) was the 16th International Rules Series contested between Gaelic footballers from Ireland and Australian rules footballers from Australia. The series was played over two test matches, with Ireland winning the series by 130-65 points on aggregate. In doing so, Ireland achieved their greatest ever winning test margin (in the first test) and greatest ever series victory, whilst Australia had their lowest ever test score in the second test. The Australian Football League (AFL) announced part of the schedule for the series in June 2011, with Etihad Stadium in Melbourne chosen for the first test match. In July, the AFL announced that Metricon Stadium on the Gold Coast would be the venue for the second test. This was the first time that any stadium in the state of Queensland hosted an international rules game. The first test was played on 28 October, while the second test was played one week later on 4 November.
Broadcast
Network Ten and its multi-channel affiliate One HD broadcast this year's series to Australian audiences. The first test match was delayed in all metropolitan areas of Australia, while the second test was broadcast live to Melbourne and Sydney audiences and delayed elsewhere. Irish-language channel TG4 broadcast the series live in Ireland, while mainstream English-language network RTÉ showed an hourly highlight show as was the case for the 2010 series in Ireland.
Background
Irish team
Former Derry Gaelic footballer Anthony Tohill returned as Ireland manager after the series loss in 2010. He was joined on the coaching and selection staff by Eoin Liston (Kerry), Kevin O'Brien (Wicklow), Seán Óg de Paor (Galway) and Kieran McGeeney (Armagh), all former international rules players. On 12 October, Tohill named 18 players of a 23-man squad (later to become 24) and also confirmed, subject to club commitments, that Stephen Cluxton would be the Ireland captain. Four further players were named on 15 October. Current Sydney Swans player Tommy Walsh joined the squad as the last selected player, while Donegal footballer Karl Lacey replaced Darren O'Sullivan in the selected squad due to the latter's club commitments. Doubts remained over the availability of several other players due to club football commitments. However, few changes were necessary as Patrick Kelly of Cork was called up to complete the 24-man squad.
Australian team
Former Western Bulldogs coach Rodney Eade was named as coach and manager of the Australian team in March. He is joined on the coaching staff by former Richmond footballer Wayne Campbell (selector), as well as former players Andrew McLeod and Brad Johnson, while Collingwood sports science director David Buttifant will be in charge of the team's preparation for the series. The Australian team was announced on 13 October minus an announced captain or leadership squad. The team is made up of talented young players aged around 20–24, yet only four players (David Wojcinski, Stephen Milne, Brad Green and James Frawley) have any prior senior international rules experience. Melbourne footballer Colin Sylvia was initially selected in the team, but was withdrawn due to inappropriate off-field behavior, diminishing the Australian squad to 23.
Brad Green, the captain of the Melbourne Football Club, was announced as the captain of Australia on 25 October. The announcement was leaked via Max Gawn on Twitter before the official AFL announcement was made. James Kelly, Andrew Swallow and James Frawley were all named as vice-captains.
Squads
**These players replaced other players initially selected in the squad who withdrew from the series due to club football commitments

† Jake King was injured in the first test and was replaced for the second test by Joel Patfull
Matches
The opening test of the series was played at Melbourne's Etihad Stadium, the second time the venue had hosted an international rules game, the previous match occurring in 2005. In front of a rather disappointing crowd of 22,921, Ireland outclassed their Australian opponents by a record 44 point margin. The margin was the greatest in the history of the series, eclipsing the 38 point win Australian win in the second test of the 2006 Series. Ireland's score of 80 points was also the biggest Irish score in the history of the series, whilst Australia's 36 points was the lowest Australian score since 1990.
Ireland skipped away to a quick lead, scoring 4 'overs' and 1 goal before Australia managed a major score. Leading by 18 points at the first break, Ireland increased their lead in the second quarter and dominated Australia in general possession. The home side were fortunate to receive their first goal of the series, with captain Brad Green making the most of an uncharacteristic error from Irish skipper and goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton. The third quarter briefly erupted with a spotfire as Ireland's Kevin Reilly approached the Australian huddle after a break in play as a result of a concussion to Emmet Bolton. The ensuing fight was largely harmless and no player was reported or sent off. Australia failed to threaten despite some improved possession in the midfield, as Ireland scored 5 overs to 1 in the quarter. The fourth quarter showcased some more classic Irish skill, with goals to Leighton Glynn and Kieran Donaghy extending the margin into record territory.
Ireland manager Anthony Tohill stated post-match that the experience of Ireland's AFL players was "huge" and instrumental in the win, whilst his opposite number Rodney Eade lamented his side's lack of physicality, stating that the Australians were "too nice" in attempting to maintain the spirit of the game. He praised the "sensational kicking skills" of the Irish team and promised a more physical Australian side for the second test.
Jake King of Australia was ruled out prior the second test with a knee injury that would also disrupt his pre-season training for Richmond. Brisbane Lions footballer Joel Patfull replaced him in the side Another disappointing crowd of 12,545 attended the match, making the cumulative crowd of approximately 35,000 one of the lowest in series history. Ireland were far superior for the duration of the match, leading at every quarter and pulling away thanks to a clever goal from Leighton Glynn in the second quarter.
Trailing by 11 points at half time, Australia managed just one over for the rest of the match, as Ireland's superior finishing skills proved decisive again. The third quarter descended into virtual madness however, with several minor fights and scuffles very nearly turning into genuine brawls. In total, five players were yellow carded (sent off for 10 minutes) in a spiteful third quarter. Ireland rapped up the test in the last quarter, finishing with three overs to one and recording a 21-point test match win, and a 65-point series victory (130-65 on aggregate).
Whilst continual speculation remained over the immediate future of the series, on account of supposed Australian apathy in terms of crowd attendance and player interest, GAA director general Paraic Duffy announced that the series would resume as planned in the years 2013 and 2014. In relation to this series however, Geelong premiership midfielder James Kelly was awarded the Jim Stynes Medal for being Australia's best player, whilst dual All-Ireland and AFL Premiership medallist Tadhg Kennelly won the GAA Medal for being the Irish player of the series.

The Florida Gators women's volleyball team represents the University of Florida in the sport of volleyball. The Gators compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Gators play their home matches in the O'Connell Center on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus, and are currently led by head coach Mary Wise.
History
The University of Florida's athletic department, the University Athletic Association, authorized the first intercollegiate varsity women's volleyball team to begin play in the fall of 1984. Marilyn McReavy was the Gators' first head coach, and she led the Gators volleyball team for seven seasons from 1984 to 1990. McReavy's Gators compiled an overall win–loss record of 156–100 (.609), and a Southeastern Conference (SEC) record of 26–20 (.565). Her best SEC finish was second place in 1988, and her 1987 team was the only one that qualified for the NCAA tournament. McReavy resigned after a 15–16 performance in 1990.
Coach Mary Wise was hired to replace Marilyn McReavy in 1991. In their first year under Wise, the Gators won the SEC regular season championship, sharing it with the LSU Tigers volleyball team.
In 1992, Florida made its first ever NCAA Final Four appearance, where they lost in the semifinals to eventual national runner-up UCLA 15–12, 15–12, 15–10.
In 1993, Wise became the first Division I female head coach to guide her team to more than one final four. In 1996, the Gators made their trip to their third final four in five years, losing to Hawaii in the semifinals. Wise was named the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) Division I National Coach of the Year.
In 1997, the Gators appeared in the final four once again, being swept by Penn State in the semifinals. The roster consisted of a young squad, only have three seniors on the team.
The Gators made their third consecutive final four in 1998, where they again lost in the semifinals, to eventual national champion and undefeated Long Beach State, 15–2, 15–8, 15–10.
In 2002, Florida made their first final four appearance since 1998, defeating Temple in the Sweet 16 and Penn State in the Elite Eight, before falling to eventual national champion Southern California in the semifinals.
After being 0-for-6 in previous NCAA Final Four semifinals, Florida broke through in 2003, by defeating Hawaii in the semis, 30–28, 30–28, 23–30, 30–28. Appearing in their first NCAA title match in school history, the Gators lost to undefeated Southern California in four sets, 25–30, 30–27, 30–19, 30–26. Wise became the first Division I female coach to coach in a championship match. In addition, Florida set a then-NCAA record of 105 straight games won during the 2003 season.
The Florida Gators opened the 2017 beating #1 Texas and #5 Nebraska in the opening weekend. They would eventually become the #1 ranked team...their first since 2010. The Gators finished the season 30-2 and reached their second final...falling to Nebraska 3–1. Rhamat Alhassan (1st Team), Carli Snyder (2nd Team), Shainah Joseph (2nd Team), and Rachael Kramer (3rd Team) would give Florida their highest total class of All-Americans in a single year in school history. Additionally, Mary Wise garnered the 2017 AVCA Coach of the Year for her third time....the second highest total in the award's history.

Secret Sphere is an Italian symphonic power metal band from Alessandria, formed by guitarist Aldo Lonobile in July 1997.
History
Early Years (1997–2011)
Guitarist Aldo Lonobile formed Secret Sphere in July 1997. Early on, the band was influenced by hard rock, heavy metal, and classical music. After some lineup changes in December 1997, the band recorded their first demo, Between Story and Legend, in September 1998. The style of the demo was firmly in the symphonic power metal genre that was expanding in Italy at that time.
The demo caught the attention of the Italian progressive/power metal label Elevate Records, who signed the band to a two-album deal. In June 1999, Secret Sphere recorded the first full-length album, Mistress of the Shadowlight. The album continued in the stylistic direction shown on Between Story and Legend, and included re-recordings of a few songs from that demo.
In October 2001, the band returned to New Sin studios (where the first album had been recorded) to record their second full-length album, A Time Never Come, also released on Elevate Records.
Secret Sphere recorded two promo CDs in 2002 while in search of a new recording deal. They caught the attention of major German heavy metal label Nuclear Blast, who would go on to release the band's third album, Scent of Human Desire, in May 2003. Scent of Human Desire presented a change in direction for the band, focusing less on fantasy themes and more on romantic, sexual themes. After the release of Scent of Human Desire, drummer Luca Cartasegna left the band, citing difference in musical tastes.
The band's fourth album, Heart & Anger, was released in May 2005 on Nuclear Blast. Daniel Flores (Mind's Eye) was brought on as a session drummer for the recordings. After the album was released, a full replacement drummer was found in Federico Pennazzato. That same year, the band planned to back up the Danish progressive metal band Royal Hunt, however, the tour was cancelled two days before it was set to begin. A 2006 Scandinavian tour backing King Diamond was more successful for the band.
In 2008, Secret Sphere released their fifth album, Sweet Blood Theory, on Avalon in Japan and the German label Dockyard 1 Records in Europe. The album was based on the short story "The Vampyre", written by John William Polidori, as well as the atmospheres of Tim Burton's cinematographic work. Longtime members Antonio Agate (keyboards) and Paolo "Paco" Gianotti (guitars) departed the band after the release of the album; both had been with the band since the recording of their demo a decade before.
Dockyard 1 Records folded in 2009, but the band was picked up by the Italian heavy metal label Scarlet Records in time for their sixth full-length album, Archetype, released in September 2010. This was the first recording with new keyboardist Gabriele Ciaccia and new guitarist Marco Pastorino.
Vocalist change, later years (2012–)
In 2012, the band began recording for their seventh album. However, part way through recording, vocalist and founding member Roberto Ramon Messina left the band due to differences in musical direction. Michele Luppi, former vocalist of the Italian progressive power metal band Vision Divine, was recruited as Roberto's replacement, and the album, entitled Portrait of a Dying Heart, was released in November of that year on Scarlet Records. Drummer Fredderico Pennazzato left shortly after; Marco Lazzarini was chosen as his replacement.
Secret Sphere returned to the studio in 2015 to re-record their second album, A Time Never Come, in commemoration of the fifteenth anniversary of its release. A Time Never Come – 2015 edition was released by Scarlet Records in April 2015.
The band signed a multi-album deal with Frontiers Records in April 2016. Later that year, Frontiers released the band's first official live recording, One Night in Tokyo, as a 2CD + DVD set. Following the release of One Night in Tokyo, guitarist Marco Pastorino left the band. The band's eighth album, The Nature of Time, was released in June 2017, with Lonobile as the sole guitarist.

An Orange Whip is a sweet cocktail made with rum, vodka, cream and orange juice. It is typically blended to a froth like a milkshake, and poured over ice in a Collins glass.
Other drinks
"Orange Whip" has also been used as brand name for non-alcoholic drinks. In the 1950s, the Tropical Fruit Company marketed an "Orange Whip" concentrate to be served as a fountain beverage. Jeanne Carmen, an actress and pinup model from that period, was once dubbed "Miss Orange Whip". The US Patent and Trademark Office lists various applications for the "Orange Whip" trademark to be applied to drinks and a chain of juice stores.
Cultural references
The Blues Brothers
The drink had a resurgence after the release of The Blues Brothers. In the film, Jake's parole officer, Detective Burton Mercer (John Candy), attends the film's pivotal fund-raising concert in order to arrest Jake and Elwood. However, Mercer decides he wants to see them perform first and orders drinks for himself and the uniformed state troopers he is with, getting silence in response after saying: "Who wants an orange whip? Orange whip? Orange whip? Three orange whips!"
The drink was not in the original script. Kenny Dugan, Orange Whip's sales director at the time, had been providing refreshments for the cast and asked if his product could be mentioned in the film. Director John Landis mentioned this to Candy, who improvised the exchange.
Pop culture
In episode 1 of the 6th season of The Blacklist the character Dembe Zuma asks the other characters if they'd like three orange whips.
The Veronica Mars episode "Of Vice and Men" alluded to The Blues Brothers line when the character Veronica, a private investigator, says: "Egg sandwich? Egg sandwich? Orange Whip?"
Rock band Seven Mary Three calls orange whips "a good time that never ends" in their song "Strangely at Home Here" from their 2008 album day&nightdriving.
The Bates College Men's Ultimate team is named Orange Whip.
In the HBO show The Wire, an uncredited character known as "Pat's Dad" in the episode "The Buys" alluded to a line from The Blues Brothers when he says: "Orange Whip? Orange Whip? Three Orange Whips!".
The term orange whip is also used by the military in Afghanistan as a slang term to ask if someone would like to go to the mess hall to eat or is at the mess hall eating. Used in a sentence: "The CJ5 FUPLANS section is out orange-whipping".
In the ABC sitcom Happy Endings episode "The Girl with the David Tattoo" the bartender asks Max and Jane if they'd like Orange Whips after they talk. The show takes place in Chicago and this is likely a reference to the Blues Brothers.
The drink inspired the naming of the "Orange Whip" nightclub in Ringwood, Victoria, Australia

The Stars Art Group or simply "The Stars" (Xīngxīng 星星) was a Chinese avant-garde group of non-professional artists in the late 1970s and early 1980s (the exact interval usually given as 1979 to 1983). It was founded by Ma Desheng and Huang Rui and included Wang Keping (王克平), Qu Leilei, Ah Cheng, Ai Weiwei, and Li Shuang (artist) as the only female member. A historically significant exhibition, now called the Star Art Exhibition, took place in late 1979 in Beihai Park, Beijing, outside the China Art Gallery. After the exhibition was closed by officials, the group staged a protest for cultural openness. They succeeded in reopening the exhibition. The exhibition took place between 23 November and 2 December, in which around 200,000 people attended the event. The group organized another exhibition the next year. Around and after 1983, the group disbanded, partly due to their members going into exile under political pressure, especially the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign of 1983.
The Stars Art Group was a foundational movement of the contemporary Chinese avant-garde active in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Mostly self-trained, the Stars championed individualism and freedom of expression both in their work and public activities. Taking personal experience and social issues as their subject matter, they pointedly diverged from state-sanctioned Socialist Realism. The group's member artists also included affiliates Zhang Hongtu and Zhang Wei, Yan Li, Yang Yiping, Qu Leilei, Mao Lizi, Bo Yun, Zhong Ahcheng, Shao Fei.

The Alexander Van Rensselaer House, also known historically as Restmere and Villalou, is a historic house at 1 Ichabod Lane in Middletown, Rhode Island. Built in 1857, it is a prominent example of Italianate architecture, designed by Richard Upjohn, with some of the earliest examples of Stick style decoration in the United States. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.
Description and history
The Alexander Van Rensselaer House stands in southwestern Middletown, not far from the Newport line on the north side of Miantonomi Avenue. It is set on a remnant of its original estate, whose drives are now designated Ichabod Lane and Restmere Terrace. It is a three-story wood-frame structure, covered by a hip roof and finished in wooden clapboards. The roof eave is extended and studded with modillion blocks, above an extended frieze band with applied Stick style decoration, small windows, and drop pendants. A single-story porch extends across the three-bay front facade, with rounded columns rising to rounded arches. A low balustrade echoes the rounded arches between the columns, and along the sides of the flared stair that provides access to the porch.
The house was built in 1857 for Alexander Van Rensselaer, a New York City businessman. He had married into the Howland family, who had summered in Newport since the 1830s. Richard Upjohn was retained to design this house, as well as the neighboring Hamilton Hoppin House, built for Van Rensselaer's brother-in-law and family. The two houses were set on nearly identical parcels, which were landscaped together by a series of meandering paths. The house was completed in 1857, two years after the death of Van Rensselaer's wife. His family maintained ownership of the property until 1904. Adolph Louis Audrain, the next owner, undertook significant renovations, and dubbed the estate "Restmere".

The Lakewood Theater is a theater complex at 76 Theatre Road in Madison, Maine, on the shores of Lake Wesserunsett. Founded in 1898 but only properly developed in 1901, it is one of the oldest summer theaters in the United States. The theater was in the 1920s and 1930s one of the major off-Broadway stops, and now plays host the community theater productions of Curtain Up Enterprises. The main auditorium is located on a former 1882 religious camp meeting sanctuary that was extensively altered in 1925-26 to accommodate the theater. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.
Description and history
The Lakewood Theater complex is set on the western shore of Lake Wesserunsett, off United States Route 201 in eastern Madison. The main theater building is a 2-1/2 story Colonial Revival wood frame structure with a gable roof. A two-story porch extends across much of the front, with square paneled posts and diamond-pattern balustrade.
The property on which the theater is built was part of a larger resort area developed by owners of the area's trolley car network to draw people to use their facilities. This particular property was where in 1882 a religious camp meeting sanctuary was built, which forms the core of the theater building. In 1884 this building was converted into a skating rink, and in 1898 its use as a theater began. The theater's rise in prominence began in 1901, when Herbert Swett took over its management, and oversaw improvements to its physical plant over a 20-year tenure. By the mid-1920s, when the building achieved its present form, the theater was a major tryout location for Broadway shows. After World War II, these types of shows declined, and the theater has since then primarily shown touring productions. Numerous famous actors, including Vincent Price, Ethel Barrymore, and George M. Cohan have graced its stage.
Playwright John B. Hymer was known as the mayor of Lakewood and collabored with fellow playwright Samuel Shipman in Lakewood. He also built Colony House there in 1929. His son Warren Hymer stayed with him and went on to a career as a movie actor.

The Westfries Museum is a museum of regional history established in the Dutch city of Hoorn.
It was opened on 10 January 1880 and has been established in a monumental building dating to 1632. This building originally belonged to the Gecommitteerde Raden van West-Friesland en het Noorderkwartier, as a part of the Staten van Holland en West-Friesland, and later became a court. Until 1932 part of the building housed the kanton's court and part of its museum.
The museum has an extensive collection of paintings, silver objects, porcelain, historic firearms, objects of the schutterij and VOC objects. The collection is exhibited in 25 rooms, of which one is a style-room. In 1953, 15th century cellars were discovered under the building. These have been restored and are now used as exhibition spaces for archaeological objects from Hoorn and its surroundings.
The museum is supported by the Friends Foundation of the Westfries Museum that was set up on the initiative of the Westfries Society.
On 10 January 2005, the night the museum celebrated its 125th anniversary, four people stole 21 paintings of its paintings, including a piece by Jan van Goyen from his youth, and part of the silver collection, valued in the millions of Euros. Four of the paintings were found back in Ukraine in April 2016.

Richard Dawson (born Colin Lionel Emm; 20 November 1932 – 2 June 2012) was an English-American actor, comedian, game-show host and panelist in the United States. Dawson was well known for playing Corporal Peter Newkirk in Hogan's Heroes, as a regular panelist on Match Game (1973–1978), and as the original host of Family Feud (1976–1985, 1994–95).
Early life
Colin Lionel Emm was born in Gosport, Hampshire, England, on 20 November 1932 to Arthur Emm (born 1897) and Josephine Lucy Emm ( Lindsay; born 1903). His father drove a moving van and his mother worked in a munitions factory. His brother John Leslie Emm (five years older) and he were evacuated as children during World War II to escape the bombing of England's major port cities in the south. In a radio interview with Hogan's Heroes co-star Bob Crane, Dawson recounted how this experience severely limited his school attendance, stating that he attended school regularly for only two years.
At age 14, he ran away from home to join the British Merchant Navy, where he pursued a career in boxing, earning almost $5,000 in shipboard matches. During 1950 and 1951, he made several passages on the RMS Mauretania from Southampton to ports of call, including Nassau, the Bahamas, Havana, and New York. Following his discharge from the merchant service, he began pursuing a comedy career using the stage name Dickie Dawson; he later changed his alias to Richard Dawson, which he eventually adopted as his legal name.
Career
Comedy and variety artist in the UK
Emm began his career in England as a stand-up comedian known as Dickie Dawson. Possibly his first television appearance occurred on 21 June 1954, when he was 21 and was featured on the Benny Hill Showcase, an early BBC Television programme focused on "introducing artists and acts new to television".
He also had at least four BBC Radio programme appearances during 1954, including two bookings on the Midday Music Hall on BBC Home Service and two spots on How Do You Do, a BBC Light Entertainment broadcast billed as "a friendly get-together of Commonwealth artists."
In 1958, he appeared alongside his future wife, Diana Dors, on BBC TV's A to Z: D, a programme featuring entertainers with names beginning with the letter D. In 1959, he made four appearances on BBC TV's Juke Box Jury, three of them alongside Dors, to whom he was by then married.
Actor and comedian in the US
In September 1961, Dawson began hosting a late-night talk show, the Mike Stokey Show, on Los Angeles channel 13, KCOP. On 8 January 1963, Dawson appeared on The Jack Benny Program, season 13, episode 15, as an audience member seated next to Jack, barely recognisable in glasses and false moustache. In the same year Dawson made a guest appearance on The Dick Van Dyke Show (season 2, episode 27) playing "Racy" Tracy Rattigan, a lecherous flirt who was the summer replacement host on the Alan Brady Show. He was credited as Dick Dawson.
In 1965, Dawson had a small role at the end of the film King Rat, starring George Segal, playing 1st Recon paratrooper Captain Weaver, sent to liberate allied POWs in a Japanese prison. Dawson had by then moved to Los Angeles. He gained fame in the television show Hogan's Heroes as Cpl. Peter Newkirk from 1965 to 1971. He had a minor role in Universal's Munster, Go Home!. A year later, Dawson released a psychedelic 45-rpm single including the songs "His Children's Parade" and "Apples & Oranges" on Carnation Records. In 1968, Dawson was in the film The Devil's Brigade as Private Hugh McDonald.
Following the cancellation of Hogan's Heroes, Dawson was a regular joke-telling panellist on the short-lived syndicated revival of the game show Can You Top This? in 1970 and joined the cast of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In that same year.
After Laugh-In was cancelled in 1973, game-show pioneer Mark Goodson signed Dawson to appear as a regular on Match Game '73, alongside Brett Somers, Charles Nelson Reilly, and host Gene Rayburn. Dawson, who had already served a year as panellist for Goodson's revival of I've Got a Secret, proved to be a solid and funny player, and was the frequent choice of contestants to participate in the Head-To-Head Match portion of the "Super-Match" bonus round, in which the contestant and a panellist of the contestant's choice had to match exactly. During Dawson's time on Match Game, he most often occupied the bottom centre seat, only sitting elsewhere (in the top centre seat) during one week early in the show's run.
Family Feud host and TV stardom
Due to his popularity on Match Game, Dawson expressed to Goodson his desire to host a show of his own. In 1975, during Dawson's tenure as one of Match Game regular panelists, Goodson began developing a spin-off game show, Family Feud. Dawson's agent practically demanded that Dawson be considered as host, even threatening that he would instruct Dawson not to display his characteristic wit on Match Game if he were overlooked. Goodson capitulated and, once seeing Dawson's talents as a host, hired Dawson to host Feud, which debuted on 12 July 1976, on ABC's daytime schedule. Family Feud was a break-out hit, eventually surpassing the ratings of Match Game in late 1977. In 1978, Dawson left Match Game due to a combination of the recent introduction of the "Star Wheel", which affected his being selected for the "Head-To-Head Match" portion of the show's "Super Match" bonus round, and of burnout from his regular appearances on both Match Game and Family Feud. Also in 1978, he won a Daytime Emmy Award for Best Game Show Host for his work on Family Feud. After he left Match Game, his spot on the panel was filled with many other stars—most notably his best friend Bob Barker, who was then the host of The Price is Right.
One of Dawson's trademarks on Family Feud, kissing the female contestants, earned him the nickname "The Kissing Bandit". Television executives repeatedly tried to get him to stop the kissing. After receiving criticism for the practice (which also included a great deal of physical contact such as holding hands and touching), he asked viewers to write in and vote on the matter. The wide majority of the approximate 200,000 responses were in favour of the kissing. On the 1985 finale, Dawson explained that he kissed contestants for love and luck, something his mother did with Dawson himself as a child.
Dawson was a frequent guest host for Tonight Show host Johnny Carson, hosting 14 times during 1979 and 1980. Dawson was a contender for the role of Tonight Show host in the event that Carson left the show, a move that Carson was seriously considering during 1979–80. (Carson ended up remaining as host until 1992.) Two of the few Carson-era Tonight Show episodes that did not air on the night they were intended were guest hosted by Dawson. During one, actress Della Reese suffered a near-fatal aneurysm mid-interview during taping; the remainder of the episode was cancelled. (Reese later recovered.) The other featured an untimely monologue regarding the danger of flying on airplanes; it was replaced with a rerun because it would have aired the same night as the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 in Chicago, which killed all 273 people aboard. (The episode aired several weeks later.)
Later years
Dawson parodied his TV persona in 1987's The Running Man opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger, portraying the evil, egotistical game-show host Damon Killian. He received rave reviews for his performance. Film critic Roger Ebert (who gave the film a thumbs down) wrote, "Playing a character who always seems three-quarters drunk, he chain-smokes his way through backstage planning sessions and then pops up in front of the cameras as a cauldron of false jollity. Working the audience, milking the laughs and the tears, he is not really much different [from] most genuine game-show hosts—and that's the film's private joke".
Dawson hosted an unsold pilot for a revival of the classic game show You Bet Your Life that was to air on NBC in 1988, but the network declined to pick up the show. In 1990, he auditioned to host the syndicated game show Trump Card; the role went to Jimmy Cefalo.
On 12 September 1994, Dawson returned to Family Feud, hosting what would become the last season of the show's second run (1988–1995) after previous host Ray Combs was fired due to spiralling ratings. During his second tenure as host, Dawson did not kiss female contestants because of a promise he had made to his young daughter to kiss only her mother. The show's ratings never recovered under Dawson and the final episode aired on 26 May 1995, after which Dawson officially retired. Family Feud remained out of production until being revived for a third run in 1999 with new host Louie Anderson, who asked Dawson to make a special appearance on the first episode to give Anderson his blessings. Dawson turned down the offer, wanting no further involvement with the show.
In 2000, Dawson narrated TV's Funniest Game Shows on the Fox network.
Personal life and family
With his first wife, actress Diana Dors, Dawson had two sons, Mark (born in London, 4 February 1960) and Gary (born in Los Angeles, 27 June 1962) The marriage ended with a divorce granted in Los Angeles in April 1967, and Dawson gained custody of both sons. He had four grandchildren.
Upon retiring, Dawson remained in Beverly Hills, California, where he had lived since 1964. He met his second wife, Gretchen Johnson (born 22 September 1955), when she was a contestant on Family Feud in May 1981; they married in 1991. A daughter, Shannon Nicole Dawson, was born in 1990. Dawson announced the birth and showed a picture of his daughter during the inaugural episode of his second stint as host of Feud in 1994 as he was greeting a contestant who had been a contestant on Match Game when he was a panelist. The episode was featured on the 25th anniversary of Family Feud as number two on the Game Show Network's top 25 Feud moments.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Dawson participated in various movements, including the Selma to Montgomery marches and George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign.
Death
Dawson died at 79 from complications of esophageal cancer in Los Angeles on 2 June 2012 at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. He is interred in Westwood Memorial Park, Los Angeles. His death came 16 years to the day after the 1996 suicide of Family Feud successor and predecessor, Ray Combs.
Dawson used to smoke almost four packs of cigarettes per day, and he was seen smoking on some episodes of Match Game, Family Feud, and Hogan's Heroes. His daughter Shannon convinced him to stop smoking by 1994, when he was 61.
On 7 June 2012, GSN aired a four-hour marathon of Dawson's greatest moments on Match Game and Family Feud, including the first episode of his 1994–95 Feud tenure.

The Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) is a specification of a framework for Java ME applications describing the basic set of libraries and virtual-machine features that must be present in an implementation. The CLDC is combined with one or more profiles to give developers a platform for building applications on embedded devices with very limited resources such as pagers and mobile phones. The CLDC was developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 30 (CLDC 1.0) and JSR 139 (CLDC 1.1).
Typical requirements
CLDC is designed for devices that have limited processing power, memory, and graphical capability. Devices typically have the following features:
16-bit or 32-bit CPU with a clock speed of 16 MHz or higher
At least 160 KB ROM allocated for the CLDC libraries and virtual machine
At least 8 KB total RAM available to the Java platform
Low power consumption, often operating on battery power
Connectivity to some kind of network, often with a wireless, intermittent connection and limited bandwidth
Noteworthy limitations
Compared to the Java SE environment, several APIs are absent entirely, and some APIs are altered such that code requires explicit changes to support CLDC. In particular, certain changes aren't just the absence of classes or interfaces, but actually change the signatures of existing classes in the base class library. An example of this is the absence of the Serializable interface, which does not appear in the base class library due to restrictions on reflection usage. All java.lang.* classes which normally implement Serializable do not, therefore, implement this tagging interface.
Other examples of limitations depend on the version being used, as some features were re-introduced with version 1.1 of CLDC.
CLDC 1.0 and 1.1
The Serializable interface is not supported.
Parts of the reflection capabilities of the Java standard edition:
The java.lang.reflect package and any of its classes not supported.
Methods on java.lang.Class which obtain Constructors or Methods or Fields.
No finalization. CLDC does not include the Object.finalize() method.
Limited error handling. Non-runtime errors are handled by terminating the application or resetting the device.
No user-defined class loaders
No thread groups or daemon threads.
Profiles
A profile is a set of APIs that support devices with different capabilities and resources within the CLDC framework to provide a complete Java application environment. There are specific profiles for devices ranging from vending machines to set-top boxes, with the mobile phone profile MIDP being the most prevalent.
Mobile Information Device Profile
The Mobile Information Device Profile is a profile designed for cell phones. There are two versions of MIDP available, specified in JSR 37 (MIDP 1.0) and JSR 118 (MIDP 2.0). Both versions provide an LCD oriented GUI API, with MIDP 2.0 including a basic 2D gaming API. Applications written to use this profile are called MIDlets. Many cell phones come with a MIDP implementation, and it is a popular platform for downloadable cell phone games.
Information Module Profile
The Information Module Profile is specified in JSR 195 and is designed for vending machines, network cards, routers, telephone boxes and other systems with either simple or no display and some form of limited two way network access. Only APIs for application creation, storage, and network access are defined. These are a subset of the javax.microedition.io, rms and midlet packages in MIDP. Siemens mobile and Nokia put forward this specification to the JCP.
DoJa Profile
The DoJa profile was designed for DoCoMo's i-mode mobile phone by NTT DoCoMo.
Digital Set-Top Box Profile
The Digital Set-Top Box profile, specified in JSR 242, is designed for the cable market. Also referred to as OnRamp, this profile is based on a subset of the OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP), which defines a set of APIs for the development of applications for set-top boxes and similar devices. The profile consists of subsets from the CDC Personal Basis Profile including support for AWT, Xlet, file access, and network APIs, as well as several media-related interfaces from OCAP. The whole profile encompassed 31 Java packages and approximately 1500 APIs.
Optional Packages
The PDA Optional Packages are specified in JSR-75 and are designed for PDAs such as Palm or Windows CE devices.
The specification defines two independent packages that represent important features found on many PDAs and other mobile devices. These packages are:
Personal Information Management (PIM) which gives devices access to personal information management data contained in address books, calendars, and to-do lists.
FileConnection (FC) which allows access to file systems and removable storage devices, such as external memory cards.
General APIs
java.io A streamlined version of the java.io package found in the standard edition for doing Input/Output operations.
java.lang Contains classes that are essential to the Java language. This package contains standard java types like Integers and Strings as well as basic exceptions, math functions, system functions, threading and security functions.
java.util A streamlined version of the java.util collection library. This package contains the collection classes like Vector and Hashtable. It also contains calendar and date class.

Nicolas de Malézieu (or Malézieux) (or Malesieu) (7 September 1650, in Paris – 4 March 1727, in Paris) was a French intellectual, Greek scholar and mathematician.
Life and career
Nicolas de Malézieu was a squire and lord of Chatenay. He later became chancellor of Dombes and secretary-general to the Swiss and Grisons of France. He was the tutor of Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine (to whom he introduced Bossuet) and he declaimed the plays of Euripides and Sophocles to the duchess who had made her chateau of Sceaux into a literary salon. Here he became a member of the light-hearted fraternity she founded, the (fr) Knights of the Bee, and organised the festivals she loved, the :fr:Grandes Nuits de Sceaux. Later tutor to duc de Bourgogne, he was appointed to the Académie royale des sciences in 1699 and to the Académie française in 1701.
Malézieu collected and published the lessons in mathematics that he gave to the duc de Bourgogne over four years in 1705 as Élémens de géométrie de Mgr le duc de Bourgogne. Le Journal des savants reported in detail the observations he made in this work on geometry and infinitely small numbers. In 1713, this work was translated into Latin as Serenissimi Burgundiae Ducis Elementa Geometrica, ex Gallico Semone in Latinum translata ad Usum Seminarii Patavini. A third (posthumous) edition, with corrections and a supplemental treatise on logarithms, appeared 1729.
Nicolas de Malézieu also translated Euripides' Iphigenia in Tauris as well as poems, songs and sketches, which were published in 1712 in Les Divertissements de Sceaux and in 1725 in the Suite des Divertissements. Among these pieces are Philémon et Baucis, Le Prince de Cathay, Les Importuns de Chatenay, La Grande Nuit de l'éclipse, L'Hôte de Lemnos, La Tarentole and L'Heautontimorumenos. Often written in a single day, these pieces were set to music and staged for the amusement of the duchess, to whom Malézieu also gave courses in astronomy.
A four-volume work, a Histoire des fermes du roi (History of Royal Farms) survives only a manuscript version dating from 1746.
Pierre-Édouard Lémontey said of Malézieu "Knowing a bit about everything, he gathered in his servile person all the advantages of universal mediocrity."
Family
Malézieu was the son of Nicolas de Malézieu (1612-1652) and Marie des Forges (d.1680). His brother Michel Louis de Malézieu married Marie Jérônime Mac Carthy (d.1714)
In 1672 Malézieu married Françoise Faudel de Fauveresse (1650-1741) by whom he had the following children:
Nicolas de Malézieu (1674-1748), bishop of Lavaur en 1713.
Pierre de Malézieu (1680-1756), married Louise Marthe Stoppa in 1717 (d.1720), under-secretary to the duc de Maine, secretary-general of the Swiss and Grisons in 1727, brigadier of the infantry, ifnanterie, maréchal de camp in 1734, lieutenant general of the artillery and commander of the Order of Saint-Louis in 1756.
Charles-François de Malézieu (d.1763), lieutenant-colonel of a brigade of carabiniers, cavalry brigadier in 1745, governor of the harbour and defences of La Rochelle.
Élisabeth de Malézieu (b.1676), married (1699) Antoine des Rioux de Missimy, first president of the parlement and intendant of Dombes
Marie de Malézieu (b.1682), married (1705) Louis de Guiry, seigneur de Noncourt and la Roncière, mestre de camp of the cavalry, lieutenant general of Aunis and la Rochelle

John Thomas Blades (8 December 1959 – 25 November 2011) was an Australian experimental music artist and member of The Loop Orchestra; he also worked as a radio broadcaster and documentary maker, and as a civil engineer. In 1982 he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and used a wheelchair from 1993. In 2010, his radio documentary, The Too Hard Basket, won the Walkley Award for 'Social Equity Journalism – All Media', and the 'Radio Documentary of the Year Award' from the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. Blades died on 25 November 2011 after complications from cancer therapy.
Biography
Experimental music bands
John Thomas Blades was born in December 1959 as the son of Douglas and Pam Blades with a brother Bruce. He grew up in Sydney and from the mid-1970s he listened to local radio, Double Jay, "[It] was like the breath of fresh air that people like me needed who had been swamped by disco, American soft rock ... rock opuses ... and the English Glam rock". In 1977 Blades and a group of school friends provided their favourite music for a radio presentation on Double Jay. His early preferences were for punk music by Ramones and The Saints, innovative music of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention and reggae. By 1978 he preferred Peter Doyle programme which featured post-punk and experimental music, "[which] incorporated the punk ideal with new elements such as electronic noise and rhythms, spoken word, dub, electronically processed voice and experimental acoustic and electronic sound".
In 1980 while studying civil engineering at University of Sydney, Blades was a founding member of electronic music group The East End Butchers with Doyle. In 1982 he was a founding member of The Loop Quartet, with Richard Fielding (ex-Severed Heads), Ron Brown and Jaimie Leonarder. During that year, the quartet performed a radio studio live to air experimental performance using loops on reel-to-reel tape machines. Blades also formed and performed in other groups: War Meat and the Dictator, and Men Like Licorice, both in 1982. That year, Blades also started working as a structural engineer for Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA): he specialised in bridge engineering. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) – his mother Pam also had the disorder – and he was hopeful of retaining mobility.
In 1982 The Loop Orchestra was formed by Blades, Fielding and Anthony Maher; and in 1983, Doyle joined. In 1990, the band's first release, Suspense, was launched at the AFI Cinema, Sydney. Annette Shun Wah from SBS TV's The Noise programme interviewed the band and Blades described their work,
for the piece, Suspense, the sound sources were all concrete, that is, all pre-existing sounds, and it was a study of the way sounds and music is constructed for suspense in horror movies. So it's all taken from scores for those films – generally untreated sections of the scores from those films, from the 1940s, through to films like Creature from the Black Lagoon of the 1950s, right through to Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the 1970s and Evil Dead in the 1980s, and so they're fragments of sound. It's like deconstructing an existing sound source and reconstructing – or structuring – something else out of that deconstruction.
By 1993 Blades' MS had progressed and he was wheelchair-bound but he continued with his work at RTA, with The Loop Orchestra and on radio. In 2007, Australian violinist, Jon Rose, spoke at the 9th Annual Peggy Glanville-Hicks Address (see Peggy Glanville-Hicks), Rose discussed Blades' enthusiasm and commitment to the Sydney music community:
Multiple sclerosis sentenced John Blades to a wheelchair, where no doubt it was expected that he would spiral slowly out of view. The contrary happened and with committed zeal, he has become a major figure in the Sydney alternative music scene, organising & conducting his Loop Orchestra, promoting & supporting new music and outsider art. Not only have his activities kept his mental state together, he tells me that his condition has actually been reversed through his involvement with music. Physical healing with music is not just the province of new agers – music can be as practical as taking aspirin.
Radio
During 1981 John Blades was invited by Ian Hartley to appear on the 2MBS' radio programme, Disc Noir, to present samples of his music collection. Hartley asked Blades to host his own show, Hot Dog You Bet, which was broadcast by 2MBS (102.5 MHz) from 1982 to 1985. Fielding had suggested the name of the show, inspired by "a flexi disc released with a New York art magazine called Smegma, an audio collage".
In March 1998, due to the severity of his MS which reduced his mobility, Blades finished working at the RTA. His most pleasing work as an engineer was on the Glebe Island Bridge: "I designed water drainage system from the bridge deck to the underground stormwater system". From 1998 Blades presented a fortnightly radio programme, Background Noise, with initial co-host Fielding, and from 2003, another ex-Severed Heads musician, Garry Bradbury on 2MBS. The programme featured "mainly experimental music with innovative film soundtracks, radio plays and spoken word". During his time at 2MBS FM, Blades also founded the Contemporary Music Collective (CMC), a group of radio broadcasters and producers who supported noise and experimental music programmes after midnight, which differs from the station's usual programming of classical music during daytime. Other programmes include Eclectic Chair, The Dust Museum and Our World Through Seratonin. In 2004 CMC organised a fund-raiser in 2004 called Dis-Co-LLaboration to celebrate 22 years on-air – Severed Heads played live, along with radio presenters and CMC members.
In 2010, Blades' documentary, "The Too Hard Basket", was broadcast on ABC Radio National, 360 Documentaries programme. It won the Walkley Award for 'Social Equity Journalism – All Media', and the 'Radio Documentary of the Year Award' from the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union. Blades died on 25 November 2011 after complications from cancer therapy.

Count Grigory Alexandrovich Kushelev-Bezborodko (, 1 February 1832, Saint Petersburg, Imperial Russia, – 13 May 1870, Saint Petersburg, Imperial Russia) was a Russian writer, publisher and philanthropist.
Kushelev-Bezborodko started out in the early 1850s as a writer who contributed short stories and sketches to Otechestvennye Zapiski, Pantheon, Molva and Russkoye Slovo. In 1856 he started to edit the latter, then four years later passed all the publishing rights to Grigory Blagosvetlov, along with all the printing facilities as a free gift, to concentrate on entrepreneurial work and literary philanthropy.
In 1858 Kushelev-Bezborodko invited Alexander Dumas to make a trip over Russia and received him as a guest at his dacha in Polyustrovo. In 1861 he visited Alexander Hertsen in London and two years later donated a large sum of money to the Common Fund (Общий фонд) which had been set to help the Russians abroad. Ignatz Kolisch was considered his secretary. He built the Château de la Roche (Annesse-et-Beaulieu) for his wife.
Among the several major publications that he financed back in Russia were the 1858 poetry collection by Apollon Maykov, the first edition of The Works by Alexander Ostrovsky (1859), as well as The Complete Lev Mey (1862—1863) in three volumes. His own literary work was collected first in the Sketches and Stories by Gritsko Grigorenko (1857) and later in the Sketches, Stories, Traveler Notes collection.
Famous Polish pianist and composer Anton de Kontski dedicated to Kushelev-Bezborodko a piece, La dolce rimembranza, Op. 158 (ca.1856).

Arde Lucus (also written as Arde Lvcvs)(Burn Lugo) is a festival celebrated in Lugo in the last weeks of June which revives the Roman and castro past of the city, and which emerged to commemorate the declaration of the city's Roman wall as a World Heritage Site in 2000. In its latest editions it has reached nearly half a million visitors.
History
This festivity, which tries to evoke the ancient Lucus Augusti in the 3rd century, began to be celebrated in the year 2000, growing in popularity year after year, with more and more people dressing up in Roman and castro attires. In the year 2009 the festival reached 460.000 participants, leaving a profit of around 10 million euros in the city.
It is necessary to mention that also, the council counts with the help of diverse associations for the celebration and ambient atmosphere of the festival, performing in many of the activities. A few of these associations are Cohors III Lucensium, Terra Copora, Ludlum, Tir Nan'og, and Trebas Galaicas.
Activities
All of the activities mix the city's Roman past with the "permission" for the celts to perform some of their rites inside the city walls.
Some of the highlighted events include:
Military Camps
They are a series of camps which have to be set up by the participants, who can be groups of people or associations, and in which they must "live" dressed up with the clothes and objects of the era. In its last edition, the camps were situated in the "Carril das Estantigas", inside Lugo's Roman walls. Also, each camp can organize its own activities and shows, always open to everyone. These camps can wither be Roman or Castro.
Celtic weddings
In this activity, the couples who wish to, can be wed by the ancient Celts rite, love union which lasts until the next year. Then, the couple can decide whether they want to renew their marriage or not (it is the woman who decides the renewal). If the marriage is renovated during seven consecutive years, the union will remain forever. At the end of the wedding, each couple is given a wedding certificate.
Macellum
An artisan market where all sorts of Roman goods are sold. Magic, juggling and music shows also take place in this place.
Roman circus
It takes place in the "Parque de Rosalía", near the historic centre. Ancient Roman activities like gladiator fights, or quadriga races, imitating the ancient Roman circuses.
The burning of the city walls
In this show, the siege of the Roman city is recreated, with fights between different groups and associations, as well as many volunteers, as well as a fireworks display.
Comilonum
It is an enormous open air banquet in which tables are placed around the Roman wall. In the 2009 edition it was substituted by the "Tabernae", a diner located in the Praza da Soidade.
Other events
Apart from the others, there are many other activities like Bacchanalia, statue building, magic shows, fancy dress parades, Roman clothes contests, Roman games, battle recreations between Romans and Celts, gladiator fights, slave sales, Roman weddings, military instruction in the city's streets and different activities to remind the citizens of the Roman and Castro past of the city. There are also some music and dance shows and parades.

Kalman Felberbaum (30 July 1923
21 December 2018) was an operatic bass singer who enjoyed an international career using the professional/stage name Carlos Feller. Of Polish descent, he grew up in Argentina, and made a career in Germany, based for decades at the Cologne Opera. He specialized in comedic supporting roles, especially bad-guys and strange, quirky characters. His signature role was Don Alfonso in Mozart's Così fan tutte.
Early life
He was born near Lviv in the western part of Ukraine, but which was part of the Second Polish Republic at the time to a Jewish family. The family emigrated to Buenos Aires, Argentina a few years later, and thereby avoided becoming casualties of the Holocaust. His parents originally wanted him to become a dentist; however, he soon began his vocal training at the opera school of the Teatro Colón. His stage career launched with the comprimario role of the doctor in Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande there in 1946.
Career
Feller stayed in Buenos Aires for more than ten years. He returned to Europe in 1958, when the Chamber Opera of Buenos Aires appeared at the World Exhibition in Brussels. He became a member of the Staatstheater Mainz, followed by engagements from 1960 at the Frankfurt Opera, and from 1962 at the Opernhaus Kiel. He appeared at the London Sadler's Wells Opera in 1958, in Cimarosa's Il maestro di cappella, and at the Edinburgh Festival as Dr. Bombasto in Busoni's Arlecchino.
Feller returned to Buenos Aires in 1966 for three years. From 1969 he was a member of the Cologne Opera for decades, where he performed a variety of roles, as an excellent actor as well as singer. He sang several Mozart roles in the cycle staged by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle: Leporello in Don Giovanni, Bartolo in Le nozze di Figaro, and Don Alfonso in his Così fan tutte. He also appeared in contemporary opera, as Doctor in Alban Berg's Wozzeck, and as Schigolch in his Lulu. He was a frequent guest at international opera houses and festivals, including the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, La Monnaie in Brussels, and the Glyndebourne Festival Opera. At the Salzburg Festival, he appeared in 1969 as Uberto in Pergolesi's La serva padrona, in 1979 as Dr. Bartolo in Le nozze di Figaro, in 1982 as Don Alfonso, and in 1984 as the notary in Der Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss. In 1988, Feller made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Don Alfonso, regarded as his signature role, and returned in 1990 as Dr. Bartolo in Rossini's Il Barbiere di Siviglia.
He retired after a final concert at the end of 2009. He died in December 2018 in the Bavarian town of Kempten.
Recordings
Feller's audio recordings include complete operas, as Dr. Bartolo in both Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro and Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia, Alfonso in Mozart's Così fan tutte, the notary in Der Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss, and roles in Rossini's La cambiale di matrimonio and Il signor Bruschino.
Performances are available on video as Dr. Bartolo (again both Rossini's, and Mozart's), Geronimo in Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto and Bardolfo in Salieri's Falstaff from the 1995 Schwetzingen Festival.

"Exchange" is a song by American singer Bryson Tiller. It was released on March 8, 2016, as the second single from his debut studio album Trapsoul (2015). The song contains a sample of K.P. & Envyi's 1998 song "Swing My Way". The song received commercial success, peaking in the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 and earning Tiller his first Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Song at the 59th annual ceremony.
Music video
On January 13, 2016, it was rumored that actor Michael B. Jordan would be the director of the music video for "Exchange", but later Jordan denied the rumor. The video premiered on Pitchfork magazine's website on June 1, 2016, and was later uploaded to Tiller's Vevo channel. It was directed by Rohan Blair-Mangat. YouTube personality Symphani Soto plays Tiller's love interest in the video.
Live performances
Tiller appeared on the Late Night with Seth Meyers on May 23, 2016, performing "Exchange". On June 26, 2016, he performed the song at the BET Awards. The song was also part of Tiller's Trapsoul Tour (2016).
Remixes
In March 2016, American rapper Ace Hood released his remix of the song titled "X-Change".
Controversy
Upon the release of J. Cole's album 4 Your Eyez Only, producers Vinylz and Boi-1da accused producer Foreign Teck (of The Mekanics) of stealing the beat, to Cole's track "Deja Vu" and giving it to Bryson Tiller, explaining why the tracks share similarities. Vinylz said Cole's track was recorded before Tiller's, and that he sent Foreign Teck a video of him making the beat to "Deja Vu", and a week later Teck posted a beat on Instagram with the same drums. Vinylz also alleged that Foreign Teck offered him publishing, a tacit admission that he had reverse engineered the beat. Another producer by the name of GMoney also made claims that he made the beat back in 2013.
Commercial performance
"Exchange" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 98 for the chart dated November 14, 2015, and has since peaked at number 26, becoming Tiller's second top 40 hit.

Queen Elizabeth High School (QEHS) is a Canadian public combined junior and senior high school in Calgary, Alberta, which teaches grades 7 through 12. The junior (7–9) and senior high (10–12) programs share a common principal, many teachers, and other resources of the school. It is operated by the Calgary Board of Education. QEHS operates separately from Queen Elizabeth Elementary School, even though the two schools are physically adjacent to each other.
History
The school was founded in 1910 as "Bowview School" which was originally a boarding school. Evidence for this can be found above the south west entrance by the cafeteria, where the previous school name is displayed. It was renamed in 1953 to mark the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.
The original three-storey building (which includes the Drama room that was the original auditorium and cafeteria) opened in 1930. A large addition (including the band room, wood shop, north gym, current offices, classrooms) was opened in 1953. The third addition was completed in 1967 and includes the library and science labs.
Academics
QEHS offers special programs for the CBE which are for students throughout the city, not just local students. Those outside the local area are given subsidized bus passes to attend the school.
Advanced Placement Program
QEHS is one of the many high schools in Calgary to offer the Advanced Placement Program, which gives student a chance to enroll in university-level courses of their choice, equivalent to most universities' introductory courses. Depending on their score on the AP Exam, students can receive university credit for the AP course.
As of May 2008, QEHS offers AP courses in the following subjects: Biology, Chemistry, English, Calculus AB, Physics and European History.
Gifted students
QEHS is one of the CBE's schools to operate the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program, which assists qualified students with more advanced instruction. GATE compacts and accelerates the typical curriculum. It combines Language Arts and Social Studies into one class (humanities) and it also provides extra experts and mentors. Currently, nine CBE schools offer the GATE program. The school is part of the Action for Bright Children Society.
Deaf and Hard of Hearing students
The Deaf and Hard of Hearing Program at Queen Elizabeth High school is a bilingual and bicultural program that supports Deaf students from grade 7 through 12 to participate in a mainstream environment. Interpreters are also provided, enabling equality and language accessibility. The Deaf students are placed in classrooms among hearing students with an interpreter who facilitates information using American Sign Language.
Alberta Ballet students
Students from across the city who attend The School of Alberta Ballet attend QEHS. Queen Elizabeth makes special accommodations for the students. Even though the Alberta Ballet, not QEHS, actually provides the dance instruction, that instruction can be used to earn credits towards a high school diploma. QEHS is one of just two schools in the city with this special relationship, the other being Bishop Carroll High.
Student body
Mascot
The school's mascot is a knight. A student is usually at pep rally events in the school wearing a suit of armor.
Knight's Fest
Every year the student leadership class hosts an event known as "Knights Fest" where students have a half day, and are able to enjoy activities such as bouncy castles and other various carnival themed activities, and there are stands where students can buy candy and knights themed merchandise. Live bands perform, notable past performers include Michael Bernard Fitzgerald and The Static Shift.
