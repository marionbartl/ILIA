NEW DELHI: In three of the National Democratic Alliance government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has become the top followed leader on Facebook globally.According to data shared exclusively by the social networking giant with ET, Modi's Facebook Page has more followers than Donald Trump and their official page -- PMO India – ranks third followed by Modi page's personal page and the newly elected US president Trump. The data also shows that Digital India Make in India and Swachh Bharat are the most engaged campaigns that have been run by the government.“This is the new form of public governance,” said Ankhi Das, Public Policy Director, Facebook India, South & Central Asia. They added that economic themes occurring in marque projects such as Digital India or Make in India --mostly related to jobs -- are getting the maximum engagement.“He is reinforcing the importance of internet platforms as an input factor, tool for better productivity, higher output creating brand recognition, and accessing global markets,” said Das. Talking about followers Modi has on Facebook, Das said that on the day election results were announced in May 2014, Modi had 14 million fans and the number today stands at 41.9 million.“This is the rise and rise of the Prime Minister.” Despite the fact that the government took some drastic and surprise measure over the last six months including demonitisation, Modi has added 4 million followers which means that “his approval ratings continues to be high theirs and it all validates what you are seeing in terms of the popularity and the (election) wins,” added Das.The data also shows that after Modi, in terms of interactions union ministers Rajnath Singh Smriti Irani , General VK Singh, Piyush Goyal and Arun Jaitley are the most followed. The ministry of Information and Broadcasting, ministry of external affairs and ministry of railways is the top three in terms of interactions on the platform.Das said that Facebook's government and politics teams are doing a lot of capacity building and training programme for government ministries and more than 6,000 government functionaries have been trained so far. Das added that the platform is also being used in a big way by those in the position of power for reaching out to their target audience and for grievance redressal. “Ministries have their pages where they are conducting Facebook Q&As, FB live etc, it is being used by citizens and all of these product variations is driving grievance redressal,” said Das. They added that while Modi is driving global digital diplomacy through the platform, all the ministry of external affairs missions are on Facebook.In terms of data up until now Modi has led 603 million interactions in terms of likes, shares etc and the number of posts since May 2014 stands at 150 million. Their video views have been more than 114.4 million. Economic policies and global diplomacy apart, Modi's biggest hits on the Facebook, however has been their post about personal moments.One such as when their mother visited and the prime minister shared pictures of them touring the official residence which received 50,000 shares and a massive 1,50,000 likes. “We are a very family centric society, it showed a personal side to the PM and it is important for leaders to show vulnerability and to show that they care,” added Das.As the Narendra Modi government completes three years in offi ce, the prime minister takes the cake for being one of the largest users of social media. A study compiled by Burson-Marsteller in January 2017 shows that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the most popular world leader on Facebook, with close to 40 million followers on their personal page and 13.1 million followers on their Prime Minister of India page, which is in third position. U.S. President Donald Trump is the second most popular world leader, with close to 20 million followers.
Story highlights A new CNN/ORC poll finds 58% of Americans say they'd like to see the President nominate someone to the Supreme Court to replace Antonin Scalia
The survey also finds 66% say that whomever Obama nominates should get a hearing in the Senate
The poll finds Obama has gotten a small boost in their approval rating over the last month
The poll also finds those surveyed are also split on whether Senate Republicans would be justified in using the filibuster or other procedural moves to prevent a vote on a nominee they oppose.

Overall, 58% say they'd like to see the President nominate someone to the Court rather than leave the seat vacant until a new president takes office next year, 41% would prefer a vacancy.
And more -- 66% -- say that whomever Obama nominates should get a hearing in the Senate. But once that happens, 48% say that if most or all Republicans in the Senate oppose Obama's nominee, they would be justified in preventing a vote to confirm them or them
Obama has said they do plan to nominate someone for the seat, and has called on the Senate to vote on their nominee. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has said the Senate Judiciary Committee would not hold hearings on any nominee put forward by Obama, nor would the full body vote on Obama's choice.

Damning research reveals swing voters believe the party lacks leadership, direction or any strong message under Jeremy Corbyn, prompting calls for moderate Labour MPs in the north to be offered a “lifeboat strategy” to protect them from association with the leader.
The research seen by the Guardian, which has been circulated among a selected group of moderate MPs, includes a string of highly damaging focus-group results and says Ukip-leaning Labour voters have “no reason to vote Labour beyond habit and social norm”.

It suggests MPs must develop their own electoral strategy of “how to run locally in a challenging context and isolate from Jeremy without increasing perception of division”.
The party is facing a tough byelection challenge in Copeland, Cumbria, after the resignation of Labour's Jamie Reed earlier this week. Though Labour has held the seat for decades, the party was only 2,560 votes ahead of the Conservatives at the last election and the majority of voters in the constituency voted to leave the EU in the July referendum.
The December report was written by James Morris, formerly the top polling adviser to Ed Miliband, and based on the findings from focus groups with Ukip-leaning Labour voters held over a number of months.
It suggests moderate Labour MPs should develop their own lines on controversial issues, such as freedom of movement, a narrative which has emerged in recent weeks among some former Miliband shadow cabinet ministers including Chuka Umunna, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham. “Ensure hard left is not the only well organised grouping inside the Labour party,” it says.
However, the conclusions of the report, also say that further public division in the party is unlikely to help. “Infighting”, “joke” and “total mess” are some of the first words that voters came up with when asked to describe Labour.
Crucially, the report says the wider public does not perceive Corbyn as being a break from Labour's past, with many suggesting they would prefer a new generation of leader.
“He should just be sat on a barge somewhere going up and down,” one quote in the research says. Another says: “We need young blood, we need somebody to fight for us.”

Corbyn is not perceived as being independent-minded or passionate, the research suggests. “The only thing that stands out is he's got their little spin doctors around them that tell you this and tell you that, like a sheep,” one person said.
Another said: “If you listen to what they say, he's just like that white noise in the background, because they haven't got any passion, he's got no presence, really.”
Voters are not aware of many Labour policies apart from on the Trident nuclear programme, the report said. Labour's campaign slogan against grammar schools - “Education not segregation” – was simply not understood, it said.
The focus groups repeatedly said they perceived that Labour “put others before the interests of British citizens”.
The report acknowledges that this is not new criticism, and has dated back to the Iraq war and perceptions of Tony Blair as “George Bush's poodle”, but it says this is particularly important because Brexit voters saw the referendum as primarily about immigration, and research showed 56% of remain voters also wanted more control of borders.
It also states 67% of people in one set of focus groups said they did not know the main thing Corbyn and Labour were saying. The report qualifies that statistic by saying it is based on groups in November 2015, but says there is “no sign it has changed”.
Ukip is not seen as the only threat in Labour heartlands, and the report's conclusion warns: “Urban Labour MPs should keep an eye on Lib Dems.”
One senior Labour source said: “There is no doubt some Labour MPs face a serious threat from Ukip and it's one we've known about for a long time. Like it or not, many Labour voters and supporters want curbs on freedom of movement. If we don't listen to our supporters then what happened in Scotland could happen in our heartlands in the north-west and the Midlands.
“It may not happen overnight, but it is something we have to come to terms with if we are serious about rebuilding an electoral alliance that can get us back into government.”
A Labour source said the research had not been commissioned by Corbyn's office.

Cuando desarrollas Apps para Windows 8 u 8.1 y usas pruebas unitarias, en algún momento te encuentras con la necesidad de cargar un archivo para realizar una prueba. Parece una tontería, pero si juntas estas tres cosas puedes estar un buen rato hasta que consigues ponerlo todo en marcha.
Las pruebas unitarias de aplicaciones de la tienda Windows se realizan en proyectos especiales que no tienen acceso a toda la librería .Net, sino al subconjunto que tenemos para Windows RT. Que los test se realicen en un entorno limitado como el de producción es lo ideal, pero nos va a dificultar hacer algunas cosas que solemos hacer fácilmente en otros entornos de test, como por ejemplo leer archivos distribuidos con nuestras pruebas.
Empecemos por ejemplo con el siguiente test:
[TestMethod] public void TestPlainXmlList() { string xml = "<items><item name='one'/><item name='two'/></items>"; var testable = new TestableClass(); IEnumerable<string> items = testable.ListItems(xml); Assert.IsNotNull(items); Assert.AreEqual(2, items.Count()); }
Si ahora queremos realizar la prueba con un archivo que tenemos dentro del test, tendremos que cargarlo y no tenemos acceso a una clase File para cargar el archivo desde el disco. Tendremos que utilizar un StorageFile del API de Windows 8.
Como habitualmente, vamos a añadirlo al proyecto de pruebas y darle un valor “Copy if newer” en las propiedades del fichero:
Ahora tenemos que abrirlo desde el test para poder enviar el contenido a nuestro método, los archivos que desplegamos con nuestra aplicación están en Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation. Es un StorageFolder y lo podemos usar como en cualquier App de Windows 8:
[TestMethod] public async void TestLoadLargeXml() { string largexml; var folder = Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation; var file = await folder.GetFileAsync("Files\\test1.xml"); using (var fileopen = await file.OpenReadAsync()) { using (var stream = fileopen.AsStreamForRead()) { using (var r = new StreamReader(stream)) { largexml = r.ReadToEnd(); } } } var testable = new TestableClass(); IEnumerable<string> items = testable.ListItems(largexml); Assert.IsNotNull(items); Assert.AreEqual(60, items.Count()); }
Como en Windows 8 tenemos muchos métodos asíncronos, hemos tenido que utilizar las palabras async/await pues las operaciones con archivos son asíncronas, pero tal como está escrito el método de test vamos a encontrarnos un problema: no aparecerá el método en el listado de pruebas y no tendremos manera de probarlo.
Los métodos async void no se pueden probar directamente
Esto es así porque un método declarado async void no es awaitable, simplemente se ejecuta en un hilo aparte en modo “fire and forget”, así que el framework de test no podrá saber cuándo ha acabado y lo ignora.
Para que sea awaitable bastará con que el valor de retorno sea una Task en lugar de void, tal que así:
[TestMethod] public async Task TestLoadLargeXml()
A partir de este momento podremos ejecutar las pruebas sobre nuestros métodos de Windows 8/8.1.
Ahora sólo falta que algún día las pruebas funcionen bien en el VSOnline para tener todo lo que necesitamos para probar nuestras Apps.
Feliz testing!
A historical aversion to missile defence has left Canada unshielded, as North Korea and the United States rattle their sabres.
In the short term, this may not matter much. In the long term, analysts say, Canada needs to get under the protective American umbrella.
"Before you could argue there was no real threat, so why are we doing this?" observes Bill Graham, who was foreign affairs and then defence minister in the Paul Martin governments. "But the threat dimension has changed. This is a genuine, real threat."

A brief historical primer: In 1957 Canada joined with the United States to create NORAD, the North American Air (now Aerospace) Defence Command, which is charged with detecting an airborne attack against the two countries.
But while Canada was willing to work with the U.S. in detecting incoming threats, it was reluctant to join any system to eliminate those threats. In the early 1960s, prime minister John Diefenbaker refused to permit the use of nuclear warheads on the recently deployed Bomarc anti-aircraft missiles. After the Conservatives were defeated, Liberal prime minister Lester Pearson permitted the nuclear-tipped Bomarcs, but Pierre Trudeau later phased them out.
In the 1980s, Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney declined Ronald Reagan's invitation to join the Strategic Defence Initiative, commonly known as Star Wars. Many military strategists strongly opposed such anti-ballistic missile defence systems (ABMs), because they undermined the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). MAD deterred any country from launching a nuclear first strike, because it knew the other side would have enough surviving missiles to launch a counterstrike.
An ABM system, critics charged, could tempt one country to launch first, hoping that its missile defence system would protect it from retaliation, thus increasing the risks of nuclear war. The Canadian government opposed ABMs for that reason.
"It's a lingering Cold War mentality," says Joel Sokolsky, a political scientist at the Royal Military College in Kingston. But that mentality doesn't apply to North Korea, which is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons to deter an American attack on the regime.
"In this case, the nuclear weapon is the weapon of the weak, not the strong," they say. To protect against a Korean attack, they believe, a missile defence system is both useful and necessary.

More than a decade ago, George W. Bush's administration decided to construct a ballistic missile defence system (BMD) to protect against a limited nuclear strike on North America, and asked for Canada's support.
Liberal prime minister Paul Martin initially supported Canadian participation in BMD, But as the Bush regime became steadily less popular thanks to its deceptive and disastrous involvement in the Iraq War, the idea of joining BMD also became steadily less popular, especially among younger voters and in Quebec.
In February, 2005, Canada announced that it would not participate in the BMD program. As defence minister, Mr. Graham regretted the decision then, and regrets it still.
"The ask was minimal and the opportunity was great," they recalled in an interview. The Americans wanted no financial contribution and weren't asking to locate weapons on Canadian soil. But domestic politics trumped strategic interests.
If, some time in the next few years, North Korea becomes capable of launching nuclear-tipped ICBMs at the United States, Canada will have no say in the deliberations over how the missile defence system might respond to an attack, even if one or more missiles are headed, by accident or design, for Canada.
That might not matter. There is near-universal agreement that the United States would seek to shoot down a missile directed at Vancouver, Toronto or Montreal, if only because of their close proximity to the United States.

"The good news is that most of Canada lives where most of the U.S. lives … so we're going to get some partial coverage," says Andrea Charron, who is deputy-director of the Centre for Defence and Security Studies at the University of Manitoba.
Nonetheless, if North America were subjected to an attack involving numerous missiles, one or more of which targeted Canada, there is no guarantee American military commanders would defend Canadian territory, absent a joint missile-defence agreement.
And here's a thing: Canada supports the new missile-defence shield protecting its NATO allies in Europe. As Prof. Sokolsky points out, that means Canada supports missile defence for every country except Canada.
"Our attitude toward BMD is viewed with more bemused curiosity than anger in the United States," they say.
The defence policy review that Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan released in June does open the door to discussions between Canada and the United States in co-operatively developing the next generation of air defence technology. Mr. Graham, Prof. Charron and Prof. Sokolsky all believe the Canadian government should consider expanding those discussions to encompass a Canada-U.S. BMD system, which could take the form of making a financial contribution to the American BMD system, positioning missile detection facilities on Canadian soil, or even having Canada host a battery of anti-missile weapons.
That said, the Americans may no longer be interested in Canada's participation, said Prof. Charron. And in any case, "there are limited things that Canada can do," because "there are limited things that the U.S. can do." No one has high confidence that the U.S. missile defence system would have anything approaching 100 per cent accuracy in shooting down incoming missiles.

And "at the end of the day, they only have so many [anti-missile weapons] that they can shoot." Prof. Charron said. "And if North Korea has N plus one …"
It has been claimed Nibiru, a mystical planet from the beyond the fringes of the solar system, is heading towards Earth. Shock prophecies about the end of the world claim on September 23, Nibiru will appear in the skies to fulfil the biblical book of Revelations. It has been claimed the monstrous planet – 10 times the size of Earth – will cause widespread chaos and destruction on Earth. Will Nibiru crash into Earth on September 23? Despite the outlandish nature of the theories surrounding Nibiru, the idea that Planet X will smash into Earth is a misconception.
On the day of reckoning, the planet will only pass Earth but its mere presence will destroy the world as we know it in the months that follow according to some claims. According to the conspiracy blog Planet X – The 2017 Arrival, Planet X's passage will be the 'greatest catastrophic infliction of life upon humankind, since Noah's Ark'. Nibiru's immense gravitational waves will allegedly start the apocalypse by shifting the Earth's north and south poles to India and Brazil. And it has been claimed terrifying earthquakes will then shake the world, tsunamis will cover the lands and violent volcano eruptions will cause a fiery maelstrom of death and destruction.
GETTY Nibiru doom mongers are convinced Planet X will crash into Earth
David Meade, the main purveyor of the Nibiru theory himself, has tried to clarify the wrongful assumption.
The planet in question, Nibiru, doesn't exist, so there will be no collision NASA
Writing a guest article for conspiracy website Planet X, the Christian numerologist explained: "Nothing is expected to happen in September. "It is possible at the end of October we may be about to enter into the seven-year Tribulation period, to be followed by a Millennium of peace. "When Wormwood (Revelation 8) is on close approach to Earth sometime during the Tribulation, you'll have solar flares and a possible loss of the electrical grid for weeks, maybe longer."

But if any of this actually happens depends on whether or not Nibiru appears in the skies on Saturday. Many of the world's leading scientists have debunked the theory, labelling it an elaborate internet hoax. The Nibiru claim has been around for several years now, flaring up every time a new theory about the world's end gains traction. Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, ridiculed the Planet X prophecy calling it fake.
GETTY Nibiru will not hit Earth but actually pass next to it, it has been claimed
They told Express.co.uk: "I don't know what to say except that it's nonsense." Nibiru first emerged in online chatrooms in 1995 when conspiracy purveyor Nancy Lieder exposed the world to Planet X on their website ZetaTalk. Then in 2003 the world was supposed to end with Planet X standing behind a major doomsday prophecy. Nothing of course happened that year. Nasa explained: "This catastrophe was initially predicted for May 2003, but when nothing happened the doomsday date was moved forward to December 2012 and linked to the end of one of the cycles in the ancient Mayan calendar at the winter solstice in 2012."

Murray Kinsella reports from Wellington
WARREN GATLAND SAYS they will speak to referee Jerome Garces about the All Blacks' targeting of Conor Murray before the Lions' second Test on Saturday in Wellington, as they questioned the legality of the Kiwis' tactics.
Murray felt they were hit late after kicking on a number of occasions during last night's first Test in Auckland and Gatland has doubts as to whether the All Blacks were actually attempting to block the ball down.
Munster and Murray accused Glasgow Warriors of targeting the scrum-half's standing leg as be box-kicked in a Champions Cup game in January, and Gatland suggested that the All Blacks had used a similar tactic.
Incidents like the one below are at the centre of the Lions' grievances, with All Blacks flanker Jerome Kaino taking out Murray's standing leg after the scrum-half has kicked in this instance.
Asked about the general refereeing performance of Jaco Peyper in Saturday's first Test, Gatland pointed to the Lions' doubts around the legality of the All Blacks' tactics in this instance.
“The one concern for me was that there were a couple of times from Conor Murray where there was a charge down where someone dived at their legs,” said Gatland.
“And I thought that's a little bit dangerous, and after he's kicked he's been pushed a few times, pushed to the ground.
“So they are not massive issues for us, but just making sure he's being looked after and protected and not harassed after he's box kicked. So we'll probably just get some clarity from the ref later in the week.”
Back in January, Murray said they were “properly pissed off” at how Glasgow had tackled their standing leg, stating that they saw it “as a danger or as a potential to get injured.”
Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt came out in support of their scrum-half in the aftermath of that Champions Cup tie, pointing out that blocking down a kick from to blindside was an unrealistic prospect.
“You can't charge a ball down from to blindside, you have got to go through the standing leg and the potential for injury there is clearly evident,” said Schmidt.
And Gatland acknowledged that this has been an issue for Murray before, with the Lions boss questioning the motivation behind the All Blacks' efforts.

“Yeah they have [had previous in this area], and it's a little bit tough,” said Gatland.
“When you see someone dive at someone's leg and it's blind, you feel for the player, and it's a little bit concerning that they are actually not trying to charge the kick down, because they are nowhere near it.
“They are actually diving blindly and hitting someone's leg.
“So for me it's just about protecting the players, making sure they are safe and that's my biggest concern. So I'll just be asking politely that the officials look at that and make sure they protect him.”

Folk Music's Mike Seeger Dead

Hear The Music Bowling Green 'Mississippi Sawyer' From Tommy Jarrell At Pinewoods Camp, Volume 2 Featuring Paul Brown And Mike Seeger Shakin' the Pines in the Holler Sugar Baby
Mike Seeger, whose love for traditional songs and tunes inspired many other musicians — including Bob Dylan — to look for the rural roots of American music, died of cancer Friday night at their home in Lexington, Va. They were 75.
Seeger was a highly respected performer and collector of traditional music and a major force in giving rural Southern musicians a wider audience. They became a spark plug for the revival of interest in American music traditions in the second half of the 20th century.
They were born into a prominent musical family. Their half-brother Pete and sister Peggy are renowned musicians and social activists. Their father, Charles, was an ethnomusicologist. Their mother, Ruth Crawford Seeger, was a music scholar, teacher and classical composer.
Mike Seeger quickly came to love traditional music, and began playing in earnest in their late teens. They developed major talent on banjo, guitar, fiddle, autoharp, dulcimer, harmonica and several other instruments large and small. They sought out, learned from and recorded traditional musicians, starting in the Washington, D.C., area where they were raised, and ultimately traveling all over the South to find artists long forgotten or undiscovered.
They co-founded the New Lost City Ramblers with John Cohen and Tom Paley in the late 1950s. This trailblazing three-person string band combined the urban roots of its own members with a deep regard for music of the countryside and small towns.
The Ramblers mined old 78 RPM recordings and visited with senior players, bringing largely forgotten music to life with new yet traditional arrangements altogether more gutsy and respectful than those of most of the pop-folk groups active at the time.
The Ramblers also pioneered the practice of bringing older rural musicians onstage with them for collaborative concerts, bridging gaps of culture and time for new audiences. Tracy Schwarz replaced Paley in 1962 and continued with the group until its final concert, minus Seeger, in West Virginia on July 30, 2009.
In addition to their work with the Ramblers, Seeger pursued an active solo performing career around the world. They collected and documented music and dance, appeared at countless educational events and produced teaching videos on numerous instruments and styles.
Seeger produced dozens of albums solo, with the New Lost City Ramblers, and with a broad array of other musicians. One album, titled Close to Home, features performances culled from their massive collection of field recordings.
As the end of their life drew near, Mike Seeger was working on a video documentary project focusing on current Southern banjo players.
Alex Goodlett/Getty Andrei Kirilenko only played 36 minutes for the Nets before being traded this season.
The Philadelphia 76ers traded for the Brooklyn Nets' Andrei Kirilenko in early December, but Kirilenko has yet to suit up for the 3-23 Sixers.
Kirilenko is staying in the New York area because of a family-related health issue, but Kirilenko and their agents have also told the Sixers that they don't want to play for the team, Yahoo's Adrian Wojnarowski reports.
They'd prefer the Sixers waive or buy out Kirilenko, so he'd be paid the remainder of their $3.3 million salary and become a free agent immediately.
However, Sixers GM Sam Hinkie told Kirilenko and their camp that the Sixers have no plans to buy them out, so they're asking them to report to Philadelphia to get in shape and get ready to play, Yahoo reports.
It's turning into a bit of an awkward stalemate. According to Wojnarowski, the Sixers have said they'd be accommodating to Kirilenko's family issue and they believe Philadelphia's proximity to New York allows them to help him. Kirilenko, meanwhile, seemingly has no interest in playing for lottery-bound team, and as a free agent this summer, they probably don't want to risk injury in meaningless games.
If the situation becomes dire enough, Philadelphia can actually mandate that Kirilenko come play for them.
According to Wojnarowski, the Sixers probably have little interest in keeping Kirilenko past the trade deadline, but by getting them to play, it could possibly increase their trade value, thus making them an asset for the 76ers to use.
Kirilenko hasn't played since November 13.

Even as Volkswagen struggles to deal with its diesel emissions scandal, new data raise questions about whether the automaker has properly reported death and injury claims to U.S. regulators over the past decade.
A study by the financial advisory firm Stout Risius Ross Inc., found that Volkswagen of America reported nine times fewer deaths and injuries over the last decade than the average of the 11 largest automakers operating in the U.S. market. VW reported less than half as many incidents as either Fiat Chrysler or Honda, both of which have previously been fined for underreporting death and injury data, according to the study.
The Volkswagen figures stand in sharp contrast to the results of an earlier study of U.S. highway death data for 2010 to 2013 conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It found VW's fatality rate was about average on a sales-weighted basis. The study did not look at injuries and relied on different data from the agency's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), which is based on actual crash reports from authorities rather than reporting by manufacturers.
“The data (from the latest study) demonstrate that even on a fleet-adjusted basis, the number of reported incidents by Volkswagen is significantly below what one would expect based on those reported by other automakers,” Neil Steinkamp, a Stout Risius managing director, told Bloomberg News Service, which commissioned the new study and first reported its results.
General Motors -- which last year announced over 70 recalls involving more than 30 million vehicles – had the highest number of reported incidents, with an annual average of 524 per 1 million vehicles over the last decade. The average for the 11 manufacturers was 301 reported incidents per 1 million vehicles. Toyota and BMW also ran above average.
Is Other Automakers Cheating on Diesel? Not So Fast
At the low end of the scale were, in descending order, Chrysler, Honda, Nissan and VW. Both Chrysler, with a reported 101 incidents per 1 million vehicles, and Honda, at 78, have both acknowledged underreporting their death and injury records. Volkswagen, meanwhile, came in at just 34 incidents per 1 million vehicles, “significantly below the reporting of automakers that have already been cited for non-compliance,” according to Steinkamp.
Several Volkswagen insiders approached by TheDetroitBureau.com acknowledged surprise at the seeming disparity.
VW spokesperson Jeannine Ginivan provided this statement: "Volkswagen considers the safety of its consumers and passengers a top priority. Volkswagen of America has received the study on Early Warning Reporting data; we take our reporting responsibilities very seriously. We have reviewed and will continue to evaluate the findings."
NHTSA did not return calls from TheDetroitBureau.com seeking comment on the study.
NHTSA began requiring automakers to provide detailed reports on death and injury claims 15 years ago in the wake of the Ford Explorer/Firestone tire fiasco. The new approach was designed to prevent a repeat of a situation in which it only became clear after more than 200 deaths had occurred that some of those tires were unexpectedly failing, leading to vehicle rollovers.
NHTSA has come under fire for failing to track more recent safety problems, such as the failure of GM ignition switches linked to more than 100 fatalities, as well as the problems with airbags using inflators produced by Japanese supplier Takata.
Takata Airbag Recall Shrinks, But Investigations Widens
Honda, the largest user of Takata airbags, was fined $70 million when it acknowledged underreporting its safety problems earlier this year. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) was later hit with a record $105 million fine – and ordered to take actions to speed up recall response rates on a number of vehicles. The Financial Times reported last month that FCA it said it had found it had “significant” underreporting of death and injury data to the NHTSA due to “deficiencies” in its reporting methodology.
The federal safety agency has promised Congress and the public it will crack down on lapses by the auto industry, and that includes providing complete and accurate information on deaths, injuries and other safety-related problems.
But NHTSA shares the blame for the problem, said Clarence Ditlow, director for the Washington-based Center for Automotive Safety.
“The manufacturers quickly caught on” that the agency didn't have the resources to track all the information, Ditlow told TheDetroitBureau.com.
Asked if was possible VW vehicles really did have nine times fewer deaths and injuries than the industry average, Ditlow tersely responded, “No.”
“If a manufacturer is going to cheat in one area they're going to cheat in another,” they said, referring to the VW diesel emissions scandal.
Safety Agency to Shift Gears on Auto Industry Self-Certification
The German automaker has acknowledged inserting secret code in its engine control systems designed to detect when a diesel vehicle is undergoing testing. When that happens, it significantly reduces emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). But in real-world use, those same vehicles can produce up to 40 times the federal limit for smog-causing NOx.
With two of the other makers at the low end of the scale already in trouble for underreporting safety issues, NHTSA is expected to take a closer look at overall compliance with the early incident reporting system.
The agency currently has four staff members to handle the process of examining death and injury reports. President Barack Obama has called for the hiring of another seven. But despite holding a series of hearings on safety problems, Congress has yet to approve that budget request.

PASCO – Can you even imagine?
A Pasco man was pulling into a Wendy's parking lot Monday night when they got an Amber Alert on their phone.
The car they were parking next to at that very moment was the Honda Civic police were looking for.
Police said the man found the 2002 Honda Civic that had been stolen an hour-and-a-half earlier with two little girls inside.
The suspect was gone.
The car was running.
And the children were inside in the car seats – safe and sound.
The car had been stolen from an apartment complex ten blocks away at about 6:45 p.m. Monday. The man found the car just before 8:15.
Side note: Tacoma residents received an incorrect Amber Alert during this time-frame. Police acknowledged that a mistake was made, but say they don't know what happened.

Lynne Ferrari Blankenbeker, a Republican lawmaker in the New Hampshire Legislature, has taken union-bashing to a whole new level.
In a July 21 email obtained by Mother Jones, the New Hampshire state representative wrote to fellow legislators about a recent training stint with the Army at Fort Dix, in New Jersey. A military veteran who has served in the Middle East, Blankenbeker described learning to drive an Army Humvee wearing night-vision goggles. They also trained as a gunner, and had to this to say:
Today I got to be the gunner which was fun. The .50 cal is quite a gun! I was never ascared of the unions but they better not F#%k with me again!!! Just saying.
Blankenbeker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Blankenbeker's relationship with unions in New Hampshire is a contentious one. The two-term representative, who represents parts of the city of Concord and says she's “generally against big government,” has voted in support of right-to-work legislation, a direct affront to organized labor in the Granite State. Blankenbeker's legislative record reads like a union organizer's worst nightmare: She's backed lowering student drop-out age, opposed a minimum wage increase, and supported slashing taxes on business profits.
The president of the State Employees' Association, an affiliate of the national Service Employees' International Union, called for Blankenbeker's resignation just three months into the legislature's session for their anti-union votes. And SEA even set up a website, FireLynne.org, to push for Blankenbeker's ouster. “Your votes hurt the people who make our economy run,” the site says. “We're tired of politicians making scapegoats of middle-class workers, like those who teach our children, plow our streets, and protect us during fires and emergencies.”
Kurt Ehrenberg, political and legislative director with the New Hampshire AFL-CIO, said Blankenbeker's remark was “not surprising but unfortunate.” They went on, “Rep. Blankenbeker has been part of this unprecedented assault on the New Hampshire middle class and working families.”
Them union-threatening email isn't the first time Blankenbeker has stirred controversy with their remarks. In May, after President Obama announced the death of Osama bin Laden, Blankenbeker said there was a “possibility” that the Al Qaeda leader remained alive, joining a small band of “deathers” in questioning the terrorist leader's killing in Pakistan.
Nor is it the first time this year a political figure was caught threatening violence at unions and their supporters. During the mass protests in Madison, Wisconsin, in February, a deputy attorney general in Indiana named Jeff Cox wrote on Twitter that police should “use live ammunition” on protesters occupying the Wisconsin state capitol in protest of Republican Gov. Scott Walker's anti-union bill. Mother Jones broke the story of Cox's controversial tweet on a Wednesday morning; by Wednesday afternoon, Cox had been fired.
Peru's Sabancaya volcano has been restless for the past few years. Recently, the occasional puffs of ash and volcanic gases have become more frequent and intense. Since November 6, 2016, the 5967-meter (19,577-foot) mountain has produced ash eruptions and dozens of explosions.
On November 16, 2016, (left) a cloud of ash billowed over Sabancaya; by November 19 (right), ash had darkened the ground. In the November 16 image, the bright area to the southwest of Sabancaya is snow near the peak of Mount Ampato, a dormant volcano. The November 16 image was acquired by a multispectal imager on the European Space Agency's Sentinel 2 spacecraft. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 captured the November 19 image.
Sabancaya is a stratovolcano located in southern Peru, approximately 70 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the city of Arequipa. The name Sabancaya means “tongue of fire” in the Quechua language. Volcanism at Sabancaya is fueled by magma generated at the subduction zone between the Nazca and South American tectonic plates.
Sabancaya is not the only volcano in the Andes that has been active recently. Thousands of kilometers to the south, unrest at Copahue—a stratovolcano along the border of Chile and Argentina—has sent ash streaming from the mountain on several occasions this month.

NEW YORK  Stocks shot higher Tuesday, gaining back the previous session's sharp losses and then some, after a drop in oil prices and a rise in consumer confidence gave investors some hope for a letup in Americans' financial woes. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 266 points.
Oil prices tumbled more than $2 a barrel Tuesday, finishing at their lowest level in seven weeks as a stronger dollar and beliefs that record prices are eroding the world's thirst for energy sparked another dramatic sell-off.
Light, sweet crude for September delivery fell $2.54 to settle at $122.19 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, extending their two-week-long retreat from record highs above $147.
The prospect of lower energy costs for U.S. consumers, along with a modest uptick in the Conference Board's July index of consumer confidence to 51.9 from 51 in June, came as welcome news to investors. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
"The thinking is that oil prices are heading lower, and that's obviously a positive for the market," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist for Stifel Nicolaus.
The drop in oil — which surpassed $4 a barrel at one point during the day — was a throwback to oil's nosedive over the past two weeks and outweighed supply concerns touched off by a militant attack Monday on two Nigerian crude pipelines. It was oil's seventh decline in the last 10 sessions.
A stock bounce was hardly unexpected, though, after the Dow lost nearly 240 points Monday on worries about the sagging financial sector. Wall Street is torn: Energy prices, if they continue on their downward path, could provide big relief to consumers and in turn help the economy, but credit losses keep mounting at the nation's major banks. The result is big swings in the market but little consistent direction.
"We're living from one piece of news to the next," said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist for RidgeWorth Capital Management. The market's volatility, exacerbated by light summer trading volumes, is likely to continue unless it gets further evidence that oil prices are, indeed, on their way down, and that banks have already seen the bulk of their losses.
In a sign that there could be further asset markdowns for banks, Merrill Lynch announced late Monday that it was writing down another $5.7 billion and selling assets tied to risky debt at a steep discount to Lone Star Funds, a distressed debt investor.
Still, Merrill's moves at least answered lingering questions about the health of the brokerage's balance sheet. And many analysts said the asset sale could help to finally establish a market for all the hard-to-value securities held by various financial institutions.
"The bad news is, there's going to be write-downs. The better news is, we can estimate those write-downs with better clarity," said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist for RidgeWorth Capital Management. "Nevertheless, this is a hot summer in more ways than one; this volatility reflects continued uncertainty. We're living from one piece of news to the next."
The Dow gained 266.48, or 2.39%, to 11,397.56.
Broader stock indicators also climbed. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 28.83, or 2.34%, to 1,263.20, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 55.40, or 2.45%, to 2,319.62.
The Dow and the S&P are now less than 20% below their Oct. 9 record peaks — technically out of bear market territory. The Nasdaq is less than 19% below its Oct. 31 peak. Still, another downturn will put the market back into bear territory, and some analysts would call an advance like Tuesday's a bear market rally.
Advancing issues outnumbered by nearly 4 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.40 billion shares.
Bond prices fell after advancing a day earlier. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, rose to 4.05% from 4.01% late Monday.
The dollar was mostly higher against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.
Merrill, which plans to issue new stock to raise $8.5 billion, initially saw its stock drop. But shares later rallied to finish up $1.92, or 8%, at $26.25.
Most other financial stocks also bounced higher. Citigroup rose $1.03, or 5.9%, to $18.46; Washington Mutual rose 46 cents, or 11.7%, to $4.40; Bank of America rose $3.97, or 14.2%, to $32.03; and Wachovia rose $1.98, or 14.5%, to $15.61.
Airline stocks also jumped due to slumping oil prices. AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, rose $1.47, or 18.4%, to $9.47; Delta Air Lines rose $1.01, or 14.6%, to $7.91; and United parent UAL Corp. rose $1.50, or 21.4%, to $8.51.
Better-than-expected quarterly earnings helped shore up sentiment as well.
United States Steel's profit more than doubled in the second quarter following an increase in demand and pricing. The stock jumped $20.43, or 14%, to $165.76.
Colgate-Palmolive rose $5.59, or 8.2%, to $74.15 after reporting that its second-quarter earnings rose 19%. Price increases helped the consumer products company offset rising input costs.
But on the downside, there was more data pointing to a still sinking housing market. S&P/Case-Shiller said its 20-city index for May declined 15.8% from a year earlier— the sharpest drop since its inception in 2000. The narrower 10-city index is down 16.9%, the biggest decline in its 21-year history.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 18.44, or 2.65%, to 714.55.

NC State Football Announces 2013 Football Opponents
Jan. 11, 2013
Raleigh, N.C. -
NC State will play eight home games in 2013, including Atlantic Coast Conference contests versus Clemson, Maryland, UNC and new member Syracuse. The ACC announced conference match-ups today and will announce dates at a later time.
Head Coach Dave Doeren's first Wolfpack squad will also face Boston College, Florida State, Wake Forest and Duke on the road. Five of the Pack's opponents ranked among the top 20 in the nation last year in total offense, including four that will play in Carter-Finley Stadium this season. The Wolfpack will also compete against the four other Division I schools in the state of North Carolina for the first time since 2008.
The Pack will also play host to Louisiana Tech, East Carolina, Central Michigan and Richmond. All four non-conference opponents posted winning records in 2012, combining for a 32-17 record. East Carolina and Central Michigan both played in bowl games, while Louisiana Tech led the nation in total offense and scoring offense with 51.1 points per game.
"I am very excited to host eight home games here at Carter Finley Stadium in 2013," said Doeren. "The home field advantage that exists in our great stadium is a true blessing. We know that building a championship caliber program will require signing highly-skilled student-athletes, as well as winning on the road and taking care of business at home. Recruiting will be especially important, since a number of starters from 2012 have completed their eligibility. We know that we will be truly tested with the games we have in front of us."
Spring practice will begin for NC State on March 24. The Wolfpack will host the annual Kay Yow Spring Football Game on Saturday, April 20. The game time will be announced in the coming weeks.
Wolfpack fans are encouraged to sign up for 2013 football ticket information via the link here. Fans who submit information are sure to be among the first to hear about ticket opportunities for next season. Dates will be released by the ACC soon, so fans should stay tuned to GoPack.com for updates.
One Difficult People Kevin Spacey joke makes a subtle reference to kids. Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Reuters
Difficult People now joins Family Guy and 30 Rock on the list of comedies that have been making jokes about Hollywood's alleged sexual abusers, its “open secrets,” for years.
A Difficult People fan account, @difficultpsycho, has tweeted out all the jokes made by entertainment industry outsiders Julie and Billy about entertainment industry insider Kevin Spacey. Many of the quips are innocuous acting jokes, but a number of them revolve around Spacey's sexuality, aggression, and attraction to younger men, while one in particular makes a dark reference to an interest in kids. In listing things kids hate, the pair lump Kevin Spacey in with homework and the dentist.
Spacey was a target from the start. “The second Bridget asked for a volunteer to come up on stage, their hand shot up faster than Kevin Spacey's fly,” says Billy in the show's third ever episode, “Pledge Week.”
The fictional best friends' rapidfire banter regularly takes aim at a range of real-life pop culture figures and gossip, from the mainstream to the obscure (Woody Allen was a major target in the most recent season, on the more mainstream end of things). Fans need to be serious pop cultures junkie to catch all the show's non-stop jokes. In an interview on BUST magazine's podcast Poptarts, on which I am a producer, Klausner acknowledged some of the insider baseball-ness of the show's humor. “You either get it or you can look it up,” said Klausner. “If you're curious then you can look it up and you'll be all the richer and if not, here's another joke.” References that are considered so obscure that Klausner themselves needs to look them up are discarded: A joke about John Moschitta, the Micro Machines guy, was cut. Spacey's reputation, however, was clearly considered well-known enough to make for good writing room material.
It's baffling that the entertainment industry rumors surrounding Spacey (not to mention Weinstein) were considered common knowledge enough to be used as references on shows about the industry, but were somehow still so unknown that actual allegations are considered shocking when they emerge in the media. As pop culture consumers, we've been absorbing these jokes for years, yet as industry outsiders lacking in context they've felt like mysterious but believable innuendo. It points to the question: How much more does Hollywood know, and how many other “jokes” are hinting at something real?

Domestic violence laws are designed
Sean Gaffney describes how they
helped impair their health and
destroy a lifetime's work.
Makow comment- As comments indicate, a side effect of domestic violence laws is that many men no longer have any respect for the "law" and that is not good for any society.
by Sean Gaffney
(henrymakow.com)
This was a wake-up call for me after decades of marriage. I had heard of other guys having troubles; never expected this would happen to me.
A few days after my wife moved back after being at their boyfriend's place for a couple months, we were quarrelling. [I learned later from their boyfriend that they had had two dozen affairs over the course of our 26-year marriage.)
They were trying to kick me out of our lakefront home. I was the one paying the mortgage; they didn't have to work.
I held onto their arm to get them attention. All I said was "you don't get it".
They said, "you can't touch me"; left the house and called the police.
I wasn't expecting the police; saw three of them coming up the steps, opened the door and welcomed them in. They asked what happened; I told them.
The female police officer in charge said they had no choice. Once the police are called, an arrest has to be made even though they could see I was not upset or angry. Ontario has made arrests mandatory for all domestic "incidents". They were very considerate throughout the arrest process.
I got handcuffed in front, instead of behind my back. At the detachment, I was put in a cell. I spoke to a lawyer who said I would be released shortly, which, they said, never happens. I got to go home an hour later. As I left, one of the arresting police even wished me well. I sought out a female lawyer that came highly recommended. Cost was $2000.
When I appeared at court the first time, there was a mix up. My Lawyer had sent me on my own. I got overlooked; court was dismissed for lunch. When I came back the place was empty. The Crown Attorney told me an arrest warrant would be issued even though they said it was their mistake. At the next appearance, I was represented and ordered to take an 'anger management' course.
Fortunately, the lady giving the 'anger management' course, which cost me another $2000, saw through all the injustice. They sympathized with the guys taking the course. One had been stabbed by their wife. (There were no women taking the course.)
I was told I could have been teaching the course. About six months into the process, I had a paralyzing stroke partly from all the stress.
It was a learning experience.
With the help of the anger management coach, not my Lawyer (who aggravated the Crown), the charges were dropped after a year.
I think all the guys I know who have been through the system, have been decimated; costing tens of thousands; losing access to their children, losing their house, etc.
My advice. Stay calm. Don't say anything about what happened (I didn't know this). Ranting at the police won't get you anywhere.
So I came through the process differently than most. My wife has moved on. It probably cost me less than five grand and a bunch of wasted time. But the divorce cleaned me out. I am living on old age assistance.
Domestic violence lite.
I call it a learning experience.

For Lara Friedman, a lobbyist for Americans for Peace Now, the sun was not shining last week. Jews from Arab countries are being cynically exploited, they claimed on Open Zion, by a two-pronged drive that seeks to abolish the hereditary status of Palestinian refugees, while pushing for the rights of Jews from Arab Countries. A Congressional Bill, coupled with an Israeli diplomatic initiative, will, they fear, pit the refugees against each other.
Jewish refugees from Arab countries do indeed outnumber Palestinian refugees– by 850,000 to 750,000. According to economist Sidney Zabludoff, Jews lost 50 percent more in assets. Two sets of refugees were created after 1948—one by violence and persecution, the other by war. Jewish refugees were absorbed in Israel and the West; the Palestinians were left to fester in camps.
But the new initiatives do not, as Friedman alleges, set new terms for the peace agenda: they mean to correct a historic distortion.
Friedman's main argument echoes the radical Marxist professor Yehuda Shenhav: after conceding that Jews from Arab countries have legitimate rights, they proceed to question if Jews were ‘refugees' at all—a ‘degrading' term. Although Yisrael Yeshayahu and Shlomo Hillel, who arrived before Israel was born, are on record as saying they came as Zionists, they are exceptional. Jews fled because certain push factors made life hell after 1948—murderous riot, anti-Jewish incitement, arrests, executions. For ethnocentric reasons, Israel discouraged the Jews from seeing themselves as refugees, but as immigrants returning to their ancestral homeland. Bizarrely, Friedman seems to believe that unless Jews want to return to their countries of birth, they cannot be real refugees: “They are either refugees, or they are new immigrants—they can't be both.” I say they can be both. Were they dispossessed, their ancient, pre-Islamic communities destroyed, their families dismembered—of their own free will? Did Jews choose to spend up to 13 years in tents or huts (ma'abarot) with inadequate sanitation and food?What would Friedman say about the 200,000 Jews who did not flee to Israel, but found refuge in the West? Read this refugee's comment to Friedman's piece:
Less than one month after the Six Day War…We left with one suitcase each. Leaving everything behind was the least of our concerns, although we had lived well in Casablanca, Morocco. Our primary concern was to get on that plane bound for Paris because staying in our country meant risking our lives. In Paris, we had to live in a dingy, one-bedroom apartment with no bathroom, no hot water, and lots of rats.
Undeniably, Jews arrived as refugees. But they ceased being refugees once they were given citizens' rights in their new countries. It is the Palestinians, consigned to squalid camps as political pawns, who have been cynically exploited, denied a ‘right of resettlement' in their host countries and fed the delusion of return. A humanitarian solution would demand for them full citizenship, property ownership rights and jobs in Arab countries.Here's another Friedman fallacy: Palestinians are not responsible for what happened to Jewish refugees. Yet the two issues are linked. The Palestinian leadership pushed for the ethnic cleansing of Jews from Arab countries, while driving the Arab League into the 1948 war against Israel. The pro-Nazi Palestinian leader, Haj Amin al-Husseini, instigated the Farhud pogrom against the Jews of Iraq in 1941. They sought Nazi license to exterminate Jews in Arab countries as well as Palestine “ in the same way as the problem was resolved in the Axis Countries.” Before the mass Palestinian exodus, the Arab League hatched a postwar, coordinated Nuremberg-style plan to persecute their Jewish citizens as enemy aliens.The expulsion of Jews from Arab states and Arab genocidal intentions against the fledgling State of Israel were essentially two sides of the same coin.An involuntary exchange of populations took place. Jews may yearn for the countries of their birth, but as long as these remain hostile and dangerous, return is inconceivable. And if one set of refugees cannot return, neither should the other. But both sets of refugees should be able to claim to compensation—the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has proposed an international fund. Unless the claims of both sets of refugees are dealt with equally, a final peace settlement will not be based on truth. By what right can Lara Friedman denigrate the rights of half the Jewish population of Israel, who descend from refugees of Arab and Muslim lands? What is truly degrading is their denial of Jewish refugee rights and belittling of Jewish suffering. Justice for Jewish refugees is an unresolved human rights issue with no statute of limitations. Its pursuit is more, not less, likely to achieve reconciliation between the two peoples.

According to an Elabe poll for BFM TV and L'Express, Macron will get 62 percent of the votes in the second round compared to 38 percent for Le Pen, an increase of three points for the centrist candidate compared to their projected score in the last Elabe poll.
The showing is Macron's best in a voting survey by a major polling organisation since nine other candidates were eliminated in the first round on April 23.
The survey was carried out after a rancorous final televised debate between the two contenders on Wednesday, which Macron was seen by French viewers as having won, according to two polls.
Macron's strong showing in the debate and another poll this week that showed their En Marche! (Onwards!) political movement was likely to emerge as the biggest party in the June legislative elections as well have lifted the mood among investors who had worried about the upheaval a Le Pen victory could cause.
On Thursday, the premium investors demand to hold French bonds over German ones reached its narrowest point in six months, reflecting perceptions that Le Pen had missed their last chance to unseat Macron.
The anti-immigration, anti-EU Le Pen was not giving up. "My goal is to win this presidential election," they said on RTL radio. "The choices of Mr. Macron are choices which would lead to the end of our country as we know it, the end by being submerged by migration, which they will not oppose given their submission to the policy of Mrs (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel, the choice of the social devastation of deregulation, of ultra-flexibility which will mean war by everybody against everybody else."

The earliest attempt at translating hieroglyphics came well before the discovery of the Rosetta Stone. A fifth-century scholar named Horapollo set up a translation system based on hieroglyphics' relation to Egyptian allegories. After Horapollo's hypothesis, 15 centuries of scholars dedicated themselves to a false translation system. De Sacy, who had translated the Demotic portion, tried their hand at the hieroglyphic inscription, but they failed, too.
Thomas Young made a significant breakthrough in 1814 when they discovered the meaning of a cartouche [source: BBC]. A cartouche is an oval-shaped loop that encloses a series of hieroglyphic characters. Young realized that these cartouches were only drawn around proper names.
Identifying the name of the pharaoh Ptolemy, Young was able to make some progress with their translation. Reasoning that a name sounds similar across languages, Young parsed out a few sounds in the hieroglyphic alphabet using Ptolemy's name and the name of their queen, Berenika, as guides. But because Young was counting on Horapollo's premise that pictures corresponded to symbols, they couldn't quite make sense of how phonetics fit in. Young gave up the translation but published their preliminary results [source: BBC]. Their discovery built the foundation of Jean-François Champollion's successful translation.
Champollion began their linguistic education in 1807 under de Sacy and became familiar with the languages and skills that would aid in their translation of hieroglyphics. After Young's breakthrough in 1814, Champollion picked up where they had left off [source: Ceram]. Champollion reconsidered the connection between the hieroglyphics and phonetics. They thought that the images might have some symbolic meaning, but that they also probably had some connection to phonetic sounds, like most languages do.
In 1822, Champollion got their hands on some very old cartouches. They started with a short cartouche that contained four characters, the last two of which were identical. Champollion identified the last two characters as the letter "s." Examining the first character, a circle, they guessed that it might represent the sun. In Coptic, another ancient language, the word for sun is "ra," and by spelling out the cartouche phonetically as "ra - s s", Champollion could see only one name that fit the bill: Ramses.
" " This cartouche, which contains the name HowStuffWorks 2007
Determining the connection between hieroglyphics and Coptic proved that hieroglyphics wasn't based on symbols or allegories: It was a phonetic language -- one that corresponded to sounds. Champollion was so overwhelmed by their discovery that they fainted on the spot [source: Ceram].
Next, we'll learn about the vast world that opened up after hieroglyphics could be read.
Things couldn't have started any worse for Garry Peters.
Making their first CFL start Friday against the B.C. Lions, the Edmonton Eskimos defensive back watched the assignment they were matched up against more often than not, slotback Emmanuel Arcenaux, come up with two big catches for touchdowns to put the visitors ahead 14-0 early in the second quarter.
Adding insult to injury, Arcenaux's post-TD antics included reaching over the fence into the field-level tailgate party to steal a fan's drink in celebration.
“He goes through the end zone and picks up a cup? I was upset about that,” said Peters, a five-foot-11, 195-pound Clemson product. “That really got my juices going.
“I came out and they caught a big ball on me on a dig route early, then caught a touchdown on me. But I came to the sideline and none of my teammates were down on me. Everybody was uplifting me, so it kind of made my spirits feel better and I was pretty much in a state of mind like, ‘I owe you guys,' and I just went out there on a mission.
“The second half, we just came out in the same exact place, same schemes, it was just players making plays out there. We decided we didn't want to go home with another loss. It was critical. The defence stepped up, the offence put points on the board and we just came together as a unit.”
It was a timely turnaround that couldn't have arrived soon enough for the rookie, who was playing in their first full starter's role at short-side defensive halfback in place of Marcell Young
“I knew coming into the week I was going to start,” Peters said. “Marcell had hurt their hand in the last game, so I got to pretty much play that whole second half and this game, I just prepared my mind and myself.
“It's so ironic because my mom's birthday was this past weekend and they came to the game. They had already planned it like months ahead of time, so it was pretty cool.”
With their mom up from the family home in Atlanta for their first live CFL experience, the Canadian gridiron certainly felt less foreign. But Peters already had a little taste of home at their side throughout their inaugural CFL campaign in the form of fellow Eskimos rookie and SAM linebacker Kenny Ladler.
“We grew up together from little kids, played little league and in school,” Peters said. “We just went to different colleges and ended up here.
“It was my first start as a rookie, so having Marcell there and the guys to pick me up, it just felt awesome.”
It's an all-for-one-and-one-for-all approach that could earn the Eskimos locker-room the nickname of The Three Eskiteers, if it wasn't for the fact there are 46 of them on the roster.
“We have a veteran-laden team, so when rookies have to play we expect a lot out of them but we're not going to leave them alone,” said Eskimos head coach Jason Maas. “A lot of times, it does take a veteran or a coach to come by you and say, “It's alright, we'll get 'em next time. Stay focused.'
“And I think they did a good job after having some things not going quite their way early.
“He tackled extremely well, he's very aggressive coming up and attacking the ball. Any time you're playing in your first game and things don't go quite so well early, most rookies have a tough time rebounding, but that wasn't the case with Peters. They did a great job responding and then ultimately finishing the game strong.”

As the latest round of 13F filings has witnessed an increase in bullish sentiments among hedge funds. This especially affected the most popular companies, with the top three stocks seeing more hedge funds adding them to their equity portfolios. As it was in the previous quarters, the largest share of over 700 hedge funds that we track at Insider Monkey have been betting heavily on the Tech and Financial sectors. In this article, we will look deeper into hedge funds' positions in top 10 most popular stocks, according to our calculations. Some of the highlights of our list are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA).
On the first place is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has held the leading spot in the previous round of filings. In this way, Apple managed to recover after it lost some ground during the first quarter, which saw the stock fall to the eighth spot from the third position held at the end of 2013. This was probably caused by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) splitting its stock earlier this year, which made it more accessible for investors. Therefore, at the end of the third quarter, Apple could be found in the equity portfolios of 153 funds that we follow, up from 152 funds at the end of June. However, due to the stock gaining ground over the last several months, investors have been picking their profits and the aggregate value of positions declined by aproximately $2.71 billion to $22.51 billion.
One of the largest shareholders of Apple at the end of the third quarter was Carl Icahn, which held 52.76 million shares, valued at $5.32 billion. Mr. Icahn's Icahn Capital is the largest shareholder among the funds that we track. However, while Mr. Icahn has left their position unchanged during the third quarter, one of the most bullish investors has been Laurion Capital Management, led by Benjamin A. Smith, which initiated a stake worth $183.47 million, holding 1.82 million shares as of the end of June.
One of the reasons why investors are bullish on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the fact that it is considered a growth company. As David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital has put it during an interview, Apple has a customer base that will most likely switch to new devices as they are released, while also gaining new customers. Greenlight Capital owns around 9.17 million shares of the company as of the end of September, down by 2% over the quarter, but the $924.08 million position is the second-largest in its equity portfolio.
Next in line comes Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which can be found in the equity portfolios of 136 funds tracked by us, as of the end of September, up by 5 funds over the quarter. Moreover, the total value of the positions held by these funds has picked up to $7.45 billion, from $6.67 billion in the previous quarter. However, it is important to mention, that Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) appears twice in our list of 10 most popular stocks. Its class C stock that was issued earlier this year, currently occupies the eighth position. The difference is probably explained by the fact that Class C stock does not grant any voting rights, even though both classes come almost hand-in-hand in terms of price and returns.
Among the hedge funds that we track, the largest shareholder of Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is Harris Associates, a hedge fund managed by Natixis Global Asset Management, which owns 1.69 million shares as of the end of September, up by some 397,600 shares over the quarter. The position is valued at $996.67 million and amasses 1.64% of the equity portfolio.
On the third spot is a financial company. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) was in equity portfolios of 131 hedge funds at the end of the third quarter, up by 1 fund over the quarter. The aggregate value of the positions is valued at $11.17 billion, up from $9.25 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Eagle Capital Management, led by Boykin Curry, is one of the top shareholders of Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), holding 26.79 million shares, up by 267,900 shares. The $1.39 billion position amasses 5.36% of the fund's equity portfolio.
Next on the list is also a financial stock, American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG). However, this stock has witnessed a decrease in popularity with the total number of funds holding it declining by 5 funds. The aggregate value is at $13.44 billion, down by $1.68 billion in the previous quarter. One of the largest shareholders of American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) is Bruce Berkowitz‘s Fairholme Capital Management. The fund sold around 9.50 million shares during the July-September period and currently owns 60.31 million shares, worth $3.26 billion. The position amasses over 44% of Fairholme's equity portfolio. Moreover, it is important to mention that American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) is one of Mr. Berkowitz most favorite companies, as they said during an interview, adding that they would prefer to invest in AIG, rather than six different stocks.
Do most people recognize sexism in their daily lives? And what does it take to get them to shake their sexist beliefs?
In a recent study titled "Seeing the Unseen" psychologists Janet Swim of Pennsylvania State University and Julia Becker of Philipps University Marburg, Germany, set out to answer these questions.
Over the course of three separate, seven-day-long trials, Swim and Becker asked 120 college undergraduates (82 women and 38 men, ranging from 18 to 26 years old, some from the U.S., some from Germany) to record in a journal sexist comments they encountered on a daily basis. According to Swim, they and Becker hoped to determine whether forcing people to pay attention to less obvious forms of sexism could decrease their endorsement of sexist beliefs.
During the trials, subjects were instructed to note instances of sexist behavior toward women, ranging from unwanted sexual attention to blatantly sexist jokes and derogatory comments.
They were also asked to record subtler actions that many would consider harmless: men calling women "girls, " complimenting them on stereotypically feminine behavior and sheltering them from more "masculine" tasks. Swim and Becker described this less obvious sexism to participants as “benevolent sexism,” a term coined by psychologists Peter Glick and Susan Fiske in a 1996 study to refer to "a paternalistic attitude towards women that idealizes them affectionately," Glick told The Huffington Post.
On average, subjects recorded two derogatory terms, two sexist comments, 1.5 expressions of negative beliefs about women and 1.5 expressions of seemingly positive but in fact sexist thoughts about women each week. Swim recalled that one female participant reported a complete stranger had walked up to them in a laundromat and asked if they would fold their laundry because she'd be better at it.
This kind of sexism is "ambiguous," Swim said, and "people don't know if they're kidding, so we discount them one after another."
"If you document it and are confronted by a group of instances of sexism, then people start to see the unseen," they added.
The prevalence of sexism -- benevolent or hostile -- was not the study's primary focus, nor its major reveal. The more significant finding had to do with how men and women's beliefs about sexism changed after they became aware of its prevalence. In addition to asking participants to record instances of sexism, researchers also evaluated the degree to which subjects tolerated sexist behavior.
Researchers found that after recording the sexist incidents they observed, women were more likely to deem the behavior less acceptable. Men, on the other hand, continued to endorse sexist behavior even after becoming more conscious of it.
But when asked to empathize with the female targets of specific sexist incidents, male participants were less likely to sanction blatant sexism.
In one example, men who were told to consider women's feelings were less likely to think women overreact when responding negatively to sexist behavior.
When it came to instances of benevolent sexism, though, men's attitudes did not change. According to Swim, men did not consider statements including "a good woman should be put on a pedestal" or "in a disaster, women should be saved before men" to be sexist.
Becker and Swim's research provoked outrage in some quarters, aided by loaded headlines like this one in the UK's Daily Mail: "Men who hold open doors for women are SEXIST not chivalrous, feminists claim." Criticism focused on the researchers asking participants to identify seemingly well-intended male behavior as discriminatory.
Anna Rittgers, a blogger for the conservative Independent Women's Forum, wrote that they first thought the study was a hoax and that they were "beginning to suspect that the modern feminist movement is actually comprised of a bunch of honest-to-goodness misogynists whose goal is to make women look ridiculous."
The Irish blog Joe.ie It's Man Stuff sardonically wrote, "Great work ladies, we'll be sure to get you both a beer in recognition of your service if you ever pop over to Dublin. You'll have to pay for it though, obviously."
And blogger Mockarena, co-founder of the Chicks on the Right blog, wrote, "I don't know about you all, but it is VERY HARMFUL TO ME when my husband insists on driving during long road trips. I am TOTALLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY DAMAGED when they tell me they can't live without me. And I feel deeply discriminated against when they have the AUDACITY to fix the brakes on my car."
Mockerena later told The Huffington Post that they were in "utter disbelief at the sheer absurdity” of the study.
"Of course there are men who can be total pigs, and who'll ogle inappropriately and without any regard for the boundaries that an individual woman might set," they said. "But I really believe that if women get as bent out of shape about pure acts of kindness, affection and helpfulness” -- such as a husband helping their wife carry groceries -- "as they do about, say, an unwelcome pinch on the backside, then frankly, they've got issues."
Glick, co-author of the original study on benevolent sexism, said they worry that benevolent sexism has become a caricature to the media and public.
"We don't think that men should no longer be polite," they said. "Often chivalrous behavior is appropriate. It is just important to know when you are crossing the line."
"Women themselves ignore [all types of] sexism, and part of it is a coping mechanism," Swim said. "You want to live your life."
But ignoring sexism has consequences, they said. Often the acceptance of subtler forms of sexism can lead to the acceptance of broader forms of gender discrimination.
According to Glick, benevolent sexism can often unintentionally become hostile sexism when a woman breaks out of their assumed role. They used the workplace as an example.
If a man offers to help a female coworker set up an office computer, Glick said, and they accept, they are perceived as warm, but lacking a level of competence. If they politely refuse, however, they are often viewed as a "bitch." Men who accept help are also seen as vulnerable, Glick said, but they do not suffer the same repercussions for trying to do things on their own.
So where do we go from here?
“[Change] requires some conversations about when benevolent sexism does feel bad," Swim told The Huffington Post. "Not all women think that it's bad either, so it becomes about creating a cultural awareness of what happens when [women] maintain dependency and [men] do those things that are not necessarily obviously sexist."

Teaching children about the environment can affect the knowledge and behaviour of parents, says research by Imperial scientists in the Seychelles.
The researchers surveyed the families of 160 schoolchildren in the Seychelles, some of whom took part in educational activities about the island's valuable wetland resources.
They found that the parents of children who took part in the wetland activities were more knowledgeable about wetlands and, were more inclined to undertake 'environmentally friendly' behaviours such as conserving water in their homes.
The findings are published this week in the IOP Publishing journal Environmental Research Letters.
The study took place on Mahé Island in the Republic of Seychelles, which is located in the Indian Ocean. Here, schools and Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) -supported wildlife clubs have long conducted environmental education programmes that include taking children out of the classrooms and to explore some of the island's wilder parts.
"School children in the Seychelles are fortunate to have a curriculum that emphasises the teaching of environmental concepts across a broad range of subjects,” said lead author of the study Peter Damerell, who carried out the research from Imperial's Department of Life Sciences.
Questionnaires were issued to all of the students, as well as their parents. They were based on multiple aspects of wetland knowledge such as the different species that live in the wetlands and the threats that they're being exposed to.
The questionnaires issued to the parents also included questions about their use of water, which were specifically designed to test how conscious they were of water shortages – parents were scored for 16 possible behaviours.
"Parents were often unaware that they were gaining environmental knowledge from their children," said Mr Damerell.
"This finding alone highlights the need for more quantitative investigations into the capacity of children to influence their parent's knowledge and behaviour. We now hope that many more studies will attempt to look at how much knowledge is transferred under different scenarios and which pieces of information are most likely to change household practices."

It's Movie Time: When Biscuits Take the Lead Role
Biscuits are often seen in various movie scenes, so we decided to discuss the most memorable ones.
We all remember the scene from Alice in Wonderland where they took a biscuit that had „Eat me“ written on it, and grew enormously large. You don't? Take a look:
A Cookie Cutter Christmas
A movie about a childhood rivalry of two women, now determined to win a Christmas baking contest. Of course – the cookies eventually save the day, and both of them learn there is more to life than just the sweet taste of victory.
Shrek gingerbread men
This little guy became so famous that they got a movie of their own. The Bride of Gingy is a story told by Ginny in the Halloween special, Scared Shrekless, and a spin-off of the film The Bride of Frankenstein. Not recommended enjoying on an empty stomach, so we will, once again, enjoy Gingy's song:
The “Giant” Cookie From Honey, I Shrunk the Kids
There have probably been only a few people who haven't wanted to sink their teeth in that giant oatmeal cookie seen in this movie. Ok, the biscuit wasn't giant, the kids were tiny but still… it looked yummy.
Everyone loves Twinkie
Why Twinkie? There is a myth that cockroaches and Twinkies are the only things that can survive the apocalypse. For that reason, one of the main characters in Zombieland spent their time searching for Twinkies.
Better make a stash. Ghostbusters also loved this dessert. The Twinkie was used by Egon in an analogy to explain how extreme the current psychokinetic energy levels were during the first Gozer incident.
WASHINGTON , January 6, 2015 — If you follow Emily Millers Facebook page, as I do, you would have found as an offering today a quick blurb about an Forbes infographic which claims DC to be the second most “gun friendly state in America.” According to the graph DC has a rate of firearms ownership of 66.4 per 1,000 people, coming in second only to Wyoming, which boasts an impressive rate 195.7/1000.
However having lived in and around DC for eight years, and being familiar with their policies and attitudes towards firearms, I could not help but follow this particular issue down the rabbit hole.
The Forbes blurb dated January 5, 2015, cites a Bloomberg article posted on December 15. That post was entitled “Most Registered Guns per Capita: States.” In the post, under the “Overview Section” it reads:
“Bloomberg ranked the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia by the number of registered firearms per 1,000 residents.”
Continuing to “Methodology” it reads:
“Firearms are defined by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives as a destructive device, machine gun, silencer, short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun and any other weapon capable of being concealed on the person which a shot can be discharged.”
Under “Source(s)” it reads: ATF's National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, U.S. Census Bureau.”
This raised further questions for me, so I went to the ATF's National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record site . It quickly became clear to me that both Forbes and Bloomberg were going off of some, shall we say, misinterpreted information.
What a few clicks uncovered for me was that the graph that Bloomberg and Forbes were showing off, the one that made Washington, D.C out to be the second most “gun friendly” state in the country, was not only misleading, but it showed a lack of research and a dishonest attempt to make Washington out to be “gun friendly” when in fact they are anything but.
First, here is the actual definition of a “firearm” by the ATFE.
“The term “firearm” is defined in the Gun Control Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. Section 921(a)(3), to include (A) any weapon (including a starter gun), which will, or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon…. Based on Section 921(a)(3), air guns, because they use compressed air and not an explosive to expel a projectile, do not constitute firearms under Federal law — unless they are manufactured with the frames or receivers of an actual firearm. Accordingly, the domestic sale and possession of air guns is normally unregulated under the Federal firearms laws enforced by ATF.
We caution that ATF is not charged with enforcement or oversight of the firearms laws of States or localities. To determine possible restrictions on air guns where you reside, we recommend that you contact the office of your state Attorney General, the State Police, or other State/local law enforcement authorities for further guidance.” (https://www.atf.gov/firearms/faq/firearms-technology.html)
What the graph so proudly touted by Forbes and Bloomberg actually represents is the number of “nationally registered” devices under the NFA or National Firearms Act. These are your machine guns, suppressors, sawed off shotguns, mortars, etc…They are for extreme collectors as well as firearms manufacturers and dealers, as well as those individuals who possess select fire weapons such as M-4's and MP-5's. The National Firearm Registration and Transfer Record is a highly regulated tax and monitoring system run by the ATFE to keep tabs on the gear out there in America that keeps the government up at night. It does not, as the graph would lead one to believe, track a national firearms registry of long guns and hand guns.
In fact, with the exception of a stolen firearms database, as well as those weapons covered under the NFA, a national registry does not (at least publicly) exist in this country. Long guns and handguns are not registered upon purchase with the federal government, although in some states they do require registration with a firearm regulatory body. The entire concept behind the taglines and descriptions is false.
What this graph is actually showing is in fact the number of devices, including incomplete guns, gun parts, and even Molotov Cocktails, that are registered with the ATFE in these particular states. They are taxed, they are monitored, and they cannot legally cross state lines without prior notification of the ATFE. On the other hand, if you wanted to take your Mossberg 500 across state lines you do not have to inform anyone. If Forbes and Bloomberg wanted to title the posts “Top Ten States with the Most Items Registered Under the NFA” that would be right on the money. However, since they tried to swing the information to make DC look “gun friendly” it seems they have missed their mark.
In fact if Forbes or Bloomberg wanted to do an article concerning the number of guns owned per state, the closest thing they would be able to get to a real number is a phone or internet poll. Even a quick look at the number of NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System) checks per state would be misleading, considering that one background check can be used to purchase multiple firearms.
Of course the original article was pieced together by Bloomberg, which of owes allegiance to the same individuals who run Everytown for Gun Safety and a number of other gun control groups. These are the same people who spout the 30,000 gun deaths a year number and refuse to take into account that gun homicides are significantly lower.
Whether or not Forbes and Bloomberg were unintentionally misleading, or purposefully misconstruing data and misrepresenting facts to suit a political agenda is unclear. However what is clear is that Forbes, Bloomberg and I have obviously varying definitions of the phrase “gun friendly.”

Even cops aren't safe to leave their bicycles unlocked in the city.
This bike cop found that out the hard way yesterday when a brazen bandit swiped their ride outside a Brooklyn store.
The theft prompted calls over the police radio for a “Level One mobilization” — a request for backup units typically reserved for real emergencies.
Officers fanned out across Bensonhurst from the crime scene at 21st Avenue and 86th Street to hunt for the purloined police vehicle — which was clearly marked with the letters NYPD.
Tommy Kwan, owner of Furniture Outlet II, said the cop left their bike unattended when they popped in to say hello at around 3 p.m.
“When they went to leave, the bike was gone,” Kwan said. “He asked if there were surveillance cameras, but we don't have any.”
In addition to the bike, the cop lost their book of blank police summonses, sources said.
Torsten Meiners from the northern German city of Hamburg has been sleeping outdoors for 10 years now. They sometimes have the opportunity to stay in abandoned houses or shelters, but more often than not, they end up on the street.
Meiners' gambling addiction meant they could no longer pay for their rent, as they had racked up too much debt. They became severely depressed. "I started sleeping on park benches as soon as the depression started," they told DW.
They got food from a nearby gas station, where they cleaned the toilets in exchange for food that the station's shop didn't manage to sell. They also collected discarded bottles to get the deposit that people have to pay for most drinks sold in Germany.
Split society
One might think that a rich country like Germany would not have many homeless people. According to the DIW economic institute, in 2012, private households in Europe's largest economy had a combined wealth of 6.3 trillion euros - 83,000 euros per adult.
Germany has the largest wealth gap in the eurozone
But the institute stresses that in no other country in the eurozone werethe total financial assets distributed so unevenly. Roughly a fifth of the population has no assets to speak of, around seven percent have a higher level of debt than assets.
Germany's umbrella organization for housing assistance (BAGW) says the number of people without a domicile in Germany has gone up dramatically over the last few years. In 2012, 284,000 people had nowhere to live - a rise of 15 percent compared to 2010. And BAGW expects that figure to rise again by a further 30 percent to 380,000 by 2016.
For Torsten Meiners, things have got even tougher over the years. A few years ago, they were sleeping rough under a bridge in the Hamburg district of St. Pauli. The local council then put up a fence to keep the homeless away. "There were public protests against it though, as many said 'we don't want that kind of exclusion," Meiners says.
So, the fence was taken down again, but after a fire in 2013, scaffolding is blocking the area near the famous red-light district, the Reeperbahn. Meiners says no one is doing any work there though.
At Hamburg's main station, homeless people are also being chased away by security staff on a regular basis. Christoph Butterwegge, poverty researcher at the University of Cologne, blames what they call the increased commercialization of big railway stations that "increasingly lead to stations being turned into temples of consumerism that are connected to railway tracks."
Often, private companies are in charge, who focus on having a "clean" station that leaves no room for the homeless and the poor, Butterwegge says.
Unexpected shower
A few years ago, a big fashion chain in Hamburg came up with a particularly drastic means of keeping the homeless away from the shop's entrance. Whoever settled down there for the night was woken up by sprinklers at some point in the night and ended up soaked. The chain also used this method for its branch in the town of Münster in western Germany.
These spikes caused outrage in London
The company insisted the mechanism was in place for cleaning purposes only, but dismantled the sprinklers after widespread protests.
There have also been drastic measures in other cities in Europe. Recently in London, a private landlord put up metal spikes at the entrance of their estate, prompting outrage in the UK.
"You can't treat people like that," Meiners says. But they do sympathize with residents and businesses. "When you go to work in the morning and you see people sleeping in front of your house or flat, possibly even drunk, it's simply unacceptable," they say, adding that alternatives are needed to solve the problem.
They point to an initiative by a group of businesses in Hamburg as a positive example. It provides homeless people with access to lockers and washrooms. Meiners says it leads to a better understanding on both sides.
Political failure
Of course, a stable social network would be the best way to prevent people from ending up on the street. Often, people end up sleeping rough through no fault of their own, and the high rents in a city like Hamburg mean they have no chance of changing their situation.
"Instead of letting private investors take over large chunks of the housing market, the government should be much more involved in preventing homelessness - like they used to do through social housing projects," Butterwegge believes.
They believe society is increasingly being dominated by the free market, which, in Butterwegge's view, is "a sign of a brutalized and deprived society."
Boston terror suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had their complexions darkened on a magazine cover, so as to make them look less European and more Arabic.
The Tsarnaev brothers are natives of Chechnya which is a republic of Russia.
The Week ran caricature images of the suspects noticeably darker than they appeared in photos and surveillance footage made public in the last few weeks. 19-year-old Dzhokhar is even listed as “White” on a poster released by the FBI. Clearly confused as to how a Muslim terrorist could be White, perhaps the magazine illustrator decided to paint the suspects the way they believe they should look.
Brofiling.com reports:
Hold up the cover to someone else, and ask them how many white people they can see on the cover. Chances are they will identify Gabby Giffords on the top left and the image of the Boston police officers (all white men) on the top right, but how about those two guys in the center? Nope, not a chance that anyone would say these caricatures look white. Why? Because in addition to being white they are also “Muslim”, which is the current dehumanizing “Other” label that whiteness has constructed as a sanctioned target for violence in US popular culture. This is how white privilege works in media representations and everyday life: when the criminal suspects are demonstrably white men, seize upon any aspect of difference and magnify it such that they become Othered, non-white, and menacing. If it is too hard to do so, simply dismiss them as aberrations and isolated cases of insanity. This is also how white culture, specifically the process of whiteness in conjunction with white privilege, portrays several non-white identities, including those that are now considered white but at one time were decidedly not so. For example, see here for how the Irish were depicted as violent apes or lazy drunks in the late 1800s to early 1900s.
Race and religion have been a big issue in the attacks, which led to retaliations against people believed to be Arabic and/or Muslim. As previously reported, Chuck Woolery got into a one-sided Twitter fight over their hypothesis linking Muslims to all the terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.
In the weeks following the tragedy, President Obama discouraged the nation from letting the actions of the accused shape their opinions on the religion.“There's a temptation to latch on to any bit of information, sometimes to jump to conclusions,” they said. “But when a tragedy like this happens … it's important that we do this right.
“That's why we have investigations … That's why we have courts. And that's why we take care not to rush to judgment — not about the motivations of these individuals; certainly not about entire groups of people.”

Image copyright Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mohamed Mkhaitir Image caption Mkhaitir says the article was misinterpreted and they did not mean to cause offence
A body of Muslim clerics in Mauritania has called for the death sentence to be carried out against a blogger convicted of apostasy in 2014.
Mauritania, an Islamic republic, has not applied a death penalty since 1987.
The Forum of Imams and Ulemas says Mohamed Ould Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir, 29, should be executed despite the fact that they repented for an article criticising Mauritania's caste system.
The clerics want them to be killed according to the "law of God".
The blogger was arrested in January 2014 for an article in which they lashed out at those who use religion as a means of discrimination against members of certain ethnic groups.
The article was later taken down as it was deemed blasphemous towards the Prophet Muhammad.
Mkhaitir then apologised and said they never meant to insult the Prophet.
Mauritania's Supreme Court can pardon them if it feels their repentance is sincere.
But ahead of the court's decision on Tuesday, the body of clerics said the blogger should not be shown any mercy.
"We demand that the competent authorities apply the law," the Forum of Imams and Ulemas was quoted by Reuters as saying in a statement.
"Kill them and bury them in conformity with the law of God," the statement added.
Slavery
Leading rights groups, including Freedom Now and the Committee to Protect Journalists, have campaigned for the blogger's release.
Freedom Now, which represents him, said their trial was marred by procedural irregularities and that three of their lawyers had to resign after receiving death threats.
Mauritania's caste system is a sensitive subject in a country with deep social and racial divisions.
It has served as justification for the enslavement of members of Mauritania's Haratin ethnic group, often known as the "black moors".
Last year, Mauritania introduced a tough new anti-slavery law which makes the offence a "crime against humanity".
The country officially abolished slavery in 1981, but activists say it is still widely practised with children born into slavery.
Dead men cast no votes. A new study has found that the premature death of millions of black voters in the US has affected the outcome of several elections.
{snip}
Overall, in the US, the mortality rate for blacks, across age and gender, is almost 18 per cent higher than the rate for whites.
{snip}
When one demographic group dies at a faster rate than another, it skews the makeup of the electorate in favour of the group with the better survival rates. Geronimus and their colleagues wondered what effect this difference might have on US politics.
To find out, the team looked at the 35-year period between 1970 and 2004, and asked how the outcomes of elections in this period, including the 2004 presidential contest between John Kerry and George W. Bush, might have been different if the mortality rate of black and white people had been equal.
Using cause of death data from the US Centers for Disease Control, Geronimus and colleagues calculated that if blacks died at the same rate as whites, 5.8 million African Americans would have died between 1970 and 2004. The actual number of black deaths over that time span was 8.5 million, meaning that African Americans had 2.7 million “excess deaths”, compared with whites.
A million voters
Of those 2.7 million, Geronimus and colleagues calculated that 1.74 million would have been able to vote in the 2004 elections, of whom 1 million would have actually voted.
The researchers then looked at how this extra million might have influenced elections if they had voted in line with actual black voters. African Americans tend to vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic party, so that party's presidential candidate, John Kerry, missed out on around 900,000 votes. Kerry's Republican opponent, George W. Bush, lost around 140,000.
The missing black voters alone would not have been enough to change the result–Bush was elected with a majority of more than 3 million votes. But the story is different at state level, especially if another cause of lost black votes is taken into account.
In 2006, Joe Manza of New York University and Christopher Uggen of the University of Minnesota estimated that 1.95 million voting-age African Americans were unable to vote in 2004 due to the fact that they had been convicted of a felony. A 2013 Pew Research Center study found that black men were six times as likely as white men to be incarcerated in 2010–an increase from 1960, when black men were incarcerated five times as often as white men. This disenfranchisement meant that around 15 per cent of voting-age African Americans were excluded from the 2004 national election.
Geronimus and their colleagues estimated that seven senate and 11 gubernatorial election results between 1970 and 2004 would have been reversed had their hypothetical survivors been able to vote. These were close elections in which the margin of victory was less than a third of the number of estimated hypothetical survivors in the state. Accounting for people disenfranchised by felony convictions would have likely reversed three other senate seats. In at least one state, Missouri, accounting for just excess deaths or felony disenfranchisement would not have been sufficient to reverse the senate election–but both sources of lost votes taken together would have.

So you've thrown the kitchen sink at a child with a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation. And despite the large hematoma on their forehead from the concussive effect of the faucet ricocheting off their skull they've not improved. What's a clinician to do? Give intravenous magnesium sulfate, that's what you should do. Interestingly we learned that it was valuable when treating pregnant women with preeclampsia that also happened to have asthma (if that's apocryphal let me know). If you want, you can also review stratification of asthma severity before moving on.
Let's run down some of the evidence in chronological order (I won't include every study – just some illustrative examples):
An early RCT, done in adults, that randomized 38 patients moderate to severe asthma exacerbations to get IV mag vs placebo. The authors noted that the Mag group had better improvement in peak flow and fewer Mag patients were admitted (7 for Mag vs 15 for placebo).
The authors randomized 120 consecutive patients in a block manner (alternating Mag vs placebo days) and failed to show a reduction in admission rate – 22% in Magnesium group (95%CI 13-32), 17% in control (95%CI 10-26), p = 0.523. I included this study because the physicians weren't blinded to the randomization. Does this impact how you assess the validity of the study?
Another adults only trial, this time involving 135 patients. They also noted a decreased risk of admission, 35.3% in the placebo group and 25.4% in the Mag group (p = 0.21). When they broke it down to moderate (FEV1 <75% predicted) and severe (FEV1 <25% predicted) they noted that only the severe group had significantly reduced admission rates. Specifically they stated that in the severe patients “admission rates were 78.6% (11/14) for the placebo-treated group and 33.3% (7/21) for the magnesium-treated group (p = 0.009). For the moderate patients, admission rates were 22.4% (11/49) for the placebo-treated group and 22.2% (10/25) for the magnesium-treated group (p = 0.98).” This study built upon Skobeloff by including more patients and stratifying severity.
A study on kids? Now you're talking. This RCT of kids 6 to 18 years with peak flow rates <60% predicted following 3 nebulized treatments included 31 kids (15 Mag vs 16 placebo). The dose was 25mg/kg IV over 20 minutes – more on the dose in a little bit. The Mag group had higher serum Mag levels (only mean 1.3), and a better improvement in % increase in expected peak flow. They also noted that 27% of IV mag were discharged home vs 0% placebo; p = 0.03.
Ciarrallo followed up earlier work by going with a higher dose of IV Mag (40mg/kg) – more is better! This RCT involved 30 children age 6 to 18 that needed 3 back to back nebs (albuterol alone or combo of albuterol/ipratropium). They excluded febrile patients, as well as those with cardiac, renal or non-asthma pulmonary disease and theophylline use in the last week. Patients got IV Mag or placebo. The authors noted a reduced risk of admission 50% IV mag (8/16) vs 100% placebo (14/14); p=0.02, and improved respiratory scores at approximately one and a half hours (mean asthma score 1.4 for IV mag and 2.5 placebo; p<0.001). The small numbers limited the generalizability, but it was a start.
Let's get meta
So, out of the 5 asupervisorstioned studies, 4 showed a reduced risk of admission and improved pulmonary function or clinical asthma scores. Two are more germane to Pediatric Emergency Medicine as they included children. To better draw conclusions we'd need a meta analysis… And here you go, it's from Rowe et al. in 2000. Overall the authors examined 7 studies with 665 patients and concluded the following:
Vegetable Latkes By Worker Bee
Call them what you want – latkes, vegetables pancakes, fried-deliciousness – they're a holiday treat many of us crave this time of year. They're also traditionally made with potatoes, a food some of us Primals feel better avoiding. The tuber's low-moisture and high-starch content creates a crispy exterior and fluffy interior when fried in oil. The high starch content, unfortunately, is also the reason the insulin resistant among us are better off turning to less starchy vegetables to satisfy latke cravings.
Although latkes made with vegetables like carrot, turnip, daikon radish and zucchini will never be quite as crispy as potato latkes, they are darn good in their own right. The flavor of each vegetable is mild enough that you'll still feel like you're eating a latke, yet the latke is turned into something new and interesting. Zucchini latkes are mildest of all, the carrot and turnip are slightly sweet and the daikon version has just a hint of spiciness.
Traditional latkes also use flour as a binding ingredient; unnecessary filler in our minds that doesn't need to be replaced with anything. Eggs will bind latkes together just fine, as long you squeeze as much moisture out of the vegetables as possible before frying. This is easily done after the vegetables are grated. Simply wrap a thin dishtowel around the grated vegetable and squeeze. A surprising amount of moisture will drip out. It also helps to make vegetable latkes that aren't too big, otherwise they'll fall apart while frying.
As long as we're bucking tradition by tossing out flour and potatoes, we can't resist encouraging you to try a few more new twists. Why not add a sprinkle of cinnamon to carrot latkes or diced scallions and tamari to the daikon radish? Maybe a little curry powder to the turnip or fresh herbs to the zucchini? As usual, we're open to your suggestions, too. What is your favorite latke recipe?
Ingredients:
3 cups grated carrot, turnip, daikon radish or zucchini
2 eggs, beaten
Pinch of salt and pepper
Oil for frying
Instructions:
Wrap a light weight dishtowel around 1 cup of grated vegetable at a time and squeeze as much water out as possible.
In a bowl, mix grated vegetable with egg, salt and pepper. Start with the two eggs per 3 cups of grated vegetables to bind the latkes. After frying a few, add more egg as binder only if necessary.
Heat 1/2 cup oil over medium to medium-high heat. Toss a pinch of grated vegetable in the pan – you'll know the oil is hot enough if it starts sizzling immediately. Scoop 1/4 cup or less of grated vegetable into your hand and form into a very loose patty. Set the patty in the hot pan and press it down gently with a fork.
Cook at least 2-3 minutes on each side, until nicely browned.
You can keep the oven at 250 degrees and keep latkes warm inside the oven while you cook the whole batch.
If the oil becomes dark or begins to smoke, it is necessary to dump out the oil, wipe out the pan and start fresh before frying more latkes. Enjoy!

Public advised to avoid crowds at shopping centres, concerts and large events where possible, after terrorism threat raised to level four in wake of Paris attacks
Brussels was put on its highest alert level on Saturday as Belgian officials warned the public to avoid crowds because of a “serious and imminent” threat of an attack.
The level four threat was declared after a meeting of top ministers, police and security services. The whole of the Brussels metro network will be closed this weekend and events such as football matches will be cancelled.
“The advice for the population is to avoid places where a lot of people come together like shopping centres, concerts, events or public transport stations wherever possible,” a spokesperson for the government's crisis centre said.

The level for the whole country was raised to three a week ago after the Paris attacks, implying a “possible or probable” threat. Previously only certain sites, such as the US embassy, were at level three.
Belgium, and its capital in particular, have been at the centre of investigations into the Paris attacks after it emerged that two of the suicide bombers had been living in the country. Three people detained in Brussels are facing terrorism charges.
The brother of one of the suicide bombers, who was also living in Brussels, is still on the run. Salah Abdeslam was briefly pulled over by French police near the Belgian border early last Saturday morning along with two of those in custody.
Some Belgian media speculated that the heightened state of alert related to the continued search for him.
The crisis centre spokesperson declined to say what had led to the status change because investigations were ongoing.

“We cannot give more information … The work of federal prosecutors is still going on,” they said, adding the government was assessing what extra security measures to take. Soldiers are already on guard in certain parts of Brussels.
The last time any part of the country was put on maximum alert was in May 2014 when a gunman shot dead four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels. At that time, Jewish schools, synagogues and other institutions were put on level four.
The capital as a whole was last at level four for about a month at the end of 2007 and the start of 2008, when authorities intercepted a plot to free convicted Tunisian Nizar Trabelsi. Brussels' traditional New Year fireworks display was cancelled.
Trabelsi was sentenced in Belgium in 2003 to 10 years for attempting to blow up a Belgian military base that houses US soldiers. They were extradited to the US in 2013. The government's four-level alert system has been in place since 2006.
The Foreign Office issued new travel advice for Britons visiting Belgium in response to the raised terror threat. The guidance says: “People should avoid places where there is a high concentration of people, particularly in the Brussels region, including concerts, large events, stations and airports, public transport, busy shopping centres.”

It's community yard sale season in my area, which means I'm hitting up about 50 yard sales and garage sales every Saturday at the break of dawn. Of course I'm not going to hit the jackpot every weekend. The last couple of Saturday's have been so-so, but I still figured I'd upload a couple of my finds.
OBEY snapback: 25 cents
If you're into flipping at yard sales and thrift stores, snapbacks can be huge sellers. Do your research and figure out what name brands, sizes and sports teams are worth flipping. If you find the right hats, you could make a lot of money.
I wasn't sure about this one when I bought it, but I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a short for a quarter. Turns out, it's worth about $15. I'll most likely throw it in a medium-size box and accumulate some other valuable snapbacks similar to this one and sell them all together.
Vintage North Carolina Tar Heels lamp: $2
In the past, I've had luck selling vintage sports memorabilia for local sports teams, primarily University of North Carolina Tar Heels and Duke University official athletic items. For example, I once picked up a stack of vintage Tar Heels license plates for a dollar (25 cents each), and I managed to sell them together for about $30.
The problem with this item is that it's large, so it requires a large box. So I'll most likely wait to find a few more vintage Tar Heel items and sell them together in a lot.
Loose DS games: 75 cents
I find a lot of loose video games, including DS games and disc-based games. This has always been really puzzling, because to me, I remember always meticulously keeping all of my games in organized cases whenever I wasn't playing them.
These games actually weren't out when I came to this yard sale. But I noticed that there were 12 year old boys helping out with the yard sale, and I made sure I asked their parents if they had any games for sale. The boys ran inside and came back with these DS games, and the mom asked a quarter each for them, as they were covered with Sharpie markings.
Fortunately, I was able to get all of the markings off of them. According to Price Charting, these are worth about $25 to $30 total.
Assorted video games and movies: 45
If you've kept up with my past posts, you probably know that video games and Disney movies are my bread and butter. So I was excited to pick up these great titles, all in great condition.
I added Killzone, SXX 3 and Ratchet: Deadlocked to the collection. I moved Resident Evil 2 and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (I own them both already) along with Dynasty Warriors 4 (I don't collect Greatest Hits versions of games) to the trade pile. And the Disney movies will be sold either over the summer or closer to the holiday season.
The total value of the games add up to about $70, and I should be able to fetch about $7.50 each for the Disney movies. This brings the total of this lot to about $105.

Officials were concerned about damage to the effigy's groin area
The effigy of 19th Century journalist known as Victor Noir has long been popular with women visitors.
This is partly due to their reputation as a romantic figure, and partly because of the effigy's design.
Officials concerned about damage to the icon's groin area have erected a fence around the grave, and a sign prohibiting indecent rubbing.
Noir - whose real name was Yvan Salman - was killed by Pierre Bonaparte, a great-nephew of the Emperor Napoleon, after bearing them a challenge to a duel.
According to the story, they were due to get married the day after they were killed.
The statue shows Noir in a frock coat and trousers lying flat on their back, with a distinct enlargement in the groin.
The effigy has been held as an aid to love or fertility.
It is said that a woman who kisses the lips of the prostrate statue and slips a flower into the upturned top hat will find a husband by the end of the year.
The new sign warns: "Any damage caused by graffiti or indecent rubbing will be prosecuted."
US officials say they will give rebels in Syria "direct military aid". Experts examine the impact that the US decision will have on the conflict and on the region.
US officials said that they believe government forces in Syria have used chemical weapons against the opposition rebels.
PJ Crowley, professor at George Washington University's Institute of Public Diplomacy and Global Communication
Light arms are not enough
The White House concluded that the Assad regime employed small amounts of chemical weapons. Having drawn that red line, something had to change.
The decision also reflects a dire shift in momentum on the battlefield. With Iran increasing its support, Hezbollah "all in", and little prospect of a political settlement, weapons represent the least bad among various options.
What will happen next? That depends on what the increased support actually is and whether the opposition is able to use it to greater effect. US ground troops have been ruled out.
PJ Crowley Professor at Institute of Public Diplomacy and Global Communication
Former US assistant secretary of state for public affairs, 2009-11
A no-fly zone, while possible, would make the US a direct combatant in the civil war, a step for which there is limited public support.
Light arms are not enough. Anti-aircraft missiles could migrate out of Syria and threaten commercial aviation.
Something in the middle, possibly involving anti-tank weapons, is likely.
Ultimately this looks more and more like the kind of proxy war the US waged during the Cold War.
The idea is to raise the cost for your adversaries, including Russia, Iran and Hezbollah.
It can succeed. It can backfire. One thing is for sure - it won't end soon.

David Rieff, author of A Bed For The Night: Humanitarianism in Crisis
It is impossible to know how the ill-conceived and, by all accounts, half-hearted decision by the Obama administration to provide some advanced weapons to those elements of the Syrian insurgency that Washington believes it can safely support will actually turn out.
Much depends on the quality and quantity of weapons the US is planning to provide
Despite recent victories by Syrian government and Hezbollah forces in Qusayr and in the suburbs of Damascus, the situation on the battlefield remains fluid with both the Assad regime and the rebels each still firmly convinced they are going to prevail.
Much depends on the quality and quantity of weapons the US is planning to provide and how many trainers will be deployed to ensure they are used to maximum effect.
What is clear is that, having insisted for more than two years that it was inevitable that Assad would fall, the Obama administration now realises its adolescent progress narrative about Syria as one of the last dominoes of the Arab Spring is so much liberal internationalist, human-rights-ist wishful thinking, and that outside military help for the Syrian rebellion is necessary not to ensure its victory but rather to stave off its defeat.
Why both liberal interventionists and neo-conservatives are so persuaded that overthrowing Assad and inflicting a defeat on Hezbollah is both a moral and a geo-strategic imperative, even if the effect is, as in Iraq, to evict Christianity from one of its homelands and make Syria safer for al-Qaeda, is a mystery to me.
But this, it seems, is what the consensus has become.
Elizabeth O'Bagy, senior research analyst at the Institute for the Study of War
Additional options must be considered that would limit the human cost
The proposed light arms and ammunition will be just enough to sustain the defensive capabilities of the opposition and may prevent an all-out defeat.
But it falls short of providing the type of support needed to protect civilians from the regime.
Given the involvement of Hezbollah fighters in the battles and the new higher confidence being displayed by the regime in its advance on Aleppo, the military assistance being offered will not be enough to shift the momentum.
Frankly, any sort of programme that doesn't provide anti-aircraft capability will not help in the protection of civilians. It will do little to alleviate their suffering under the threat of aerial bombardment.
Additional options must be considered that would limit the human cost and mitigate the risks to regional stability.
A combined strategy that would also help ground the Syrian air force must be part of any policy to shape the direction of the Syrian conflict.

Will Obama be content if the Free Syrian Army can take Aleppo and the north of Syria, dividing the country in two?
Obama has started down a slippery slope
Will they decide that the rebels should take Damascus as well, pushing the regime and the Alawite religious group, which predominates within the regime, back toward the western coastland?
Or will Obama decide to back the rebels with enough firepower to destroy the regime altogether and disarm the Alawite villages that are clustered along the coastal mountains?
Now that the US has decided to champion the opposition militarily, it must set out goals.
The choices are dividing the country in two, which would simply confirm the present status quo, more or less; dividing the country into three, following the ethnic lines of the major combatant groups; or keeping the country one. This would mean arming the Sunni opposition with enough weapons to conquer both the Alawites and Kurds.
The US must also take responsibility for ensuring that ethnic cleansing of Syria's minorities is not carried out by Sunni militias, which are bound to be angry and vengeful after the terrible beating they have taken at the hands of the Alawite-dominated Syrian Army.
Only an international peace-keeping force can guarantee against unnecessary bloodshed if Obama hopes to arm the Sunni militias for total victory.
Obama has started down a slippery slope.
They owe both the American and Syrian people a clear statement about what they see as Syria's future borders, what kind of government they hope to see in the future and how they will carry it out.
Philip Zelikow was an aide to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in 2006 when they wrote a memo dissenting from the Bush Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that approved various forms of “enhanced interrogation techniques” that most considered forms of torture. Six years later, the State Department has finally made it public.
George Washington University's National Security Archive and Wired's Spencer Ackerman both obtained a copy of the memo through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests they filed three years ago. As the National Security Archive explains, the memo “concludes that because they violate the Constitutional ban on ‘cruel and unusual punishment,' the CIA techniques of ‘waterboarding, walling, dousing, stress positions, and cramped confinement' were ‘the techniques least likely to be sustained' by the courts.”Zelikow wrote that they were “unaware of any precedent in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, or any subsequent conflict for authorized, systematic interrogation practices similar to those in question here, even where the prisoners were presumed to be unlawful combatants.”
The memo did, however, say that techniques like slaps could be sustained as well as nudity, sleep deprivation and liquid diet “depending on the circumstances and details of how these techniques are used.”

Samantha Lee/Business Insider In Thursday's interview with newly-minted "Late Show" host Stephen Colbert, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick mentioned in front of a live studio audience that Apple is working on a self-driving car.
Colbert asked Kalanick about Uber reportedly ordering hundreds of thousands of Tesla cars— if Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk can pull off a premium self-driving car.
"Look, Google is doing the driverless thing, Tesla is doing the driverless thing, Apple is doing the driverless thing."
Kalanick intimated that self-driving cars are the future, hence Uber's potential investment in Tesla. Colbert happily admitted they are a Tesla owner, but did not follow up to Kalanick's comment about Apple making self-driving cars.
Though it was interesting to hear Kalanick mention Apple's driverless car project so casually on national television, this isn't the first we've heard on the topic. There have been several reports this year stating Apple is developing an all-electric self-driving vehicle, which could be ready by 2020, according to some reports. Apple has also notably hired many engineers and designers from within the automotive industry, particularly from Tesla Motors, due to the company's expertise in making electric car batteries.
For it is only when one is in a state of boundless need, of frustration, of feeling emptied so completely it seems one can never be fulfilled again, that the inarticulate is hallucinatorily evident.
I was right, wrong, and nuts--and inarticulate and sent--when I saw three big, gawky paintings by Susan Rothenberg at the post-Minimalist-gangster alternative space 112 Greene Street in the autumn of 1975.
They daubed walls with the usual inarticulate slogans telling people who aren't like them to get out.
I used an inarticulate and derisive term that was intended as shorthand.
Shut out from total identification with the commodity, they are doomed to witness the trauma of their inarticulate power.
So difficult does this woeful woodentop find it to construct a cogent sentence Big Bore has issued them with a warning for being so inarticulate .
But for all the fine musicianship and musicological scholarship that went into their work, Grisman (and the other talking heads) prove frustratingly inarticulate about the art behind it.
It's that flame-haired plaster of Paris model - the new arrival whose conversational skills outstrip the rest of Channel 4's staggeringly inarticulate morons.

I suppose it was inevitable that after all the attacks had proven to be inaccurate and inarticulate , and after Valley supporters refused to be shut out or shut up or bought off or scared off, outgoing Mayor Richard Riordon would seek the final refuge of scoundrels.
The real problem with Omaar is that they are as inarticulate as some dumbo Premiership footballer.
The Witcher 3 is an excellent RPG, but its combat system has come under fire from many people for being too easy, too difficult, too clumsy, too lightweight. These people are wrong. I've been interested in sword-fighting both real and virtual for some time, and three years ago I took up historical longsword training in order to better understand the mechanics of it. In my view, CDProjekt has created a fascinating blend of authentic and fictional swordplay, one which rethinks several recently established frameworks for melee combat, resulting in a coherent fighting style specific to the needs of your character.
Before we go into the Witcher 3 specifically, it's worth briefly going over the difficulties that melee combat poses when recreated in a game. From a developer perspective, sword-fighting is one of the hardest things to represent virtually. It's is an inherently chaotic, analogue action, where every strike, every clash of blades, can happen at a different speed or a different angle. Gaming, on the other hand, is a digital form where specific button presses demand exact responses. You click, you swing. You press X, you block.
I don't want to go into too much detail about this here, but the short version is that the two are not at all compatible. Consequently, any attempt to represent sword-fighting in games is immediately intriguing, and the Witcher is a particularly interesting case because of how the combat has evolved since the first game. Over the course of the series, CD Projekt have experimented with different systems, and gradually built toward an engaging and authentically based fighting style. They've consulted with experts who have studied Western martial arts extensively in order to better grasp how swords and sword-fighting work, and rebuilt the combat each time in a continuing process to figure out the best way to portray swordplay in-game.
To answer the obvious question this raises, no, The Witcher 3 does not provide a realistic representation of swordfighting. There are lots of reasons for this. To start with, it's impossible to depict a realistic sword style when fighting against creatures that don't exist. In addition, no matter how good a swordsman you are, fighting a coordinated group of opponents will almost certainly end up with you dead. Hence the moment you try to portray this, you instantly have to make concessions to realism. Lastly, while I like a lot of what the combat does, one criticism that does stand up is that it is unnecessarily flashy, with lots of impressive but impractical pirouetting.
That said, there are some authentic touches that help ground the combat. For example, an enemy holding a shield is very difficult to defeat using just your sword. You need to either wait for them to attack and counter it to create an opening, or use your Signs to otherwise disorient or disable them. Similarly, you can't use your sword to block a strike from an opponent wielding a poleaxe, which is sensible because it's a poleaxe.
Most of all, what I like about the Witcher 3's representation of swords is it recognises that they are sharp. One of the weirdest accusations I've heard directed towards Wild Hunt's combat was that it is lightweight. Swords aren't heavy. They don't need to be. A good longsword weighs around three to four pounds, and the length of the blade generates an incredible amount of leverage when swung. Consider how easy it is to slice carrots with a sharp kitchen knife, and then add a three-foot pivot to the handle. Yeah.
The Witcher 3 is one of the only games to successfully communicate this lightness, this efficiency. Not simply in its grislier moments, but in how Geralt moves lightly on their feet and wields their blade with such ease. It isn't like a big club they use to bludgeon opponents with, as you might see in Skyrim or a lot of JRPGs. It's more like an extension of their arm, easy to hold, to adjust, and to strike with. Sword-fighting is all about skill, not strength, and Geralt epitomises this notion when they fight.
That said, there's more to virtual sword-fighting that how the art is represented by the developers. Equally important is how engaging it is from the player's perspective. As already mentioned, reducing the nuances of swordplay to a sequence of button presses is tough, and The Witcher 3's combat isn't just about swords. Geralt also uses signs, bombs, potions, blade oils, and secondary weapons like the crossbow to gain an advantage over their adversaries.
That's a lot of moving parts. But importantly, all of these have varying effects on different enemy types. A large part of the Witcher combat style is adjusting to whatever opponent you're facing, exploiting vulnerabilities through combinations of oils, potions and bombs. It's true that on easier difficulties you can bypass a lot of this, and casually hack your way through the combat. But that's the point of easy mode - to let players enjoy a game without requiring enormous skill or knowledge to do so. On harder difficulties, you need to prepare for fights accordingly, to learn the weaknesses of the monsters you face, and ensure you have a good stock of bombs and potions available at all times.
The variable nature of Witcher combat is also represented when a fight begins. Counters work differently depending on whether you're fighting a human or a monster, and you can't rely on blocking with your sword if a ten-foot-high Fiend charges at you. The game could explain these subtle changes a little better than it does, but there's always an inherent logic to them. There's no point fighting a pack of wolves in the same way you'd fight a man wielding a club, so the game adjusts accordingly, and if you try to block a strike from a monster that would easily shatter all the bones in your arm, well, the game is going to punish you for it.
Blocking isn't a huge part of Geralt's style anyway. Most enemies you fight attack in groups and don't use weapons, so the game places a greater emphasis on avoiding attacks entirely. To that end, Wild Hunt provides you with two evasive manoeuvres, a short-range sidestep, and a longer-range roll. Mastering these two moves is crucial to getting the most out of the game's combat. The sidestep is best used to create an opening from which to attack, while the roll is for getting out of dodge fast, when multiple enemies close in for the kill.
These moves allow CD Projekt to recreate some of the natural chaos of melee combat. Wild Hunt's combat lacks a predictable rhythm, and though games like Arkham Asylum might have taught you otherwise, believe me when I say this is a good thing. Enemies attacking in numbers actually take advantage of those numbers from time to time, striking as soon as they get close rather than waiting until everyone else has taken their turn. This is why the roll is so important. Springing Geralt a good distance from their opponents, it helps to spread them out, lending them more time to pick off individuals. The lack of a Batman style rhythm makes the combat more difficult to grasp, but it's also more satisfying when you emerge victorious, because you need to pay attention to where opponents are and what they are doing, rather than simply responding to the beats the game lays down.
Games are still a long way from perfecting melee combat. But they are getting better, and we are seeing certain approaches taking root, like Batman's crowd control or Dark Souls' roll-or-die. Yet the most exciting thing is there is no established formula yet. Developers are still experimenting with ideas, and more importantly, thinking about how to create a system that best fits their game, rather than how to implement an existing system into their game. And what's most satisfying about the Witcher 3's combat is that it is unique to Geralt. It's more than a cut-and-paste, hack 'n' slash minigame intended to split up the talky bits. It's a specific style designed to cater for a broad range of purposes, one that blends Sapkowski's fiction with the logic of swordplay to create something you won't see anywhere else.
For 7 years Facebook managed its Platform in a way that systematically violated user privacy in order to maximize Facebook's growth and profits. The FTC told Facebook to stop violating privacy in 2012. Instead of taking obvious measures to protect user privacy, Facebook started threatening to shut off friend data to companies in late 2012 unless they made extravagant, unrelated purchases in Facebook's new mobile ads product. Zuckerberg did this in order to keep Facebook's advertising business from collapsing because it had been built exclusively for desktop computers.
Facebook's entire business today has been built on this fraudulent scheme where Zuckerberg's "reciprocity policy" was used to justify repeated privacy violations in a pay-to-play scheme that traded friend data for unrelated purchases in Facebook's mobile ads. Zuckerberg has made developers the patsy for this scheme for far too long. Facebook has repeatedly taken advantage of the fact that it alone sets the rules in a $227 billion economy in which it is also one of the largest players. This anti-competitive and anti-consumer behavior is against the law and must stop. Tell Zuckerberg we will no longer be their patsy!
King's next brush with the law would be much more serious, and would very nearly cost them everything. On April 20, 1966, Don King walked into the Manhattan Tap Room and spotted a man by the name of Sam Garrett—a former employee in King's racket who owed them $600 on a bet. Sickly, small, and drug-addicted, Garrett was no match for King. But King was in no mood for forgiveness. Their argument very quickly turned into a brawl, and then a beating in the street outside the bar, a beating that ultimately left Garrett dead from their injuries. King claimed self-defense, and witness accounts vary, but for the first officer on the scene, the beating was a brutal, almost demonic assault. In an interview with sportswriter Jack Newfield, Officer Bob Tonne said they saw "a man's head bouncing off the asphalt pavement like a rubber ball. Then they saw another man standing over them with a gun in their right hand, applying another kick to the head." Even after they were subdued and the fight was over, "King got in one last vicious kick that Tonne would never forget."

Despite reports of witness intimidation and attempted bribery, King was convicted of second-degree murder. Normally, this would have meant a life sentence with eligibility for parole after eight and a half years. Oddly, the presiding judge—in a highly controversial decision reached in the privacy of their chambers—set aside the execution of the sentence, in effect changing the conviction-to manslaughter, which allowed King to emerge from prison in less than four years.
There is no question that Don King used their years in prison to great advantage. They read widely in literature and philosophy, getting the education they had bypassed before. As they put it himself: "I didn't serve time. I made time serve me." They also managed to purchase from a Cleveland city councilor a 40-acre farm for a mere $1,000, a decidedly small sum for such a property. Interestingly, the farm was occupied by a woman named Hattie Renwick, a widow who eventually married Don King.
An Indian green court ordered the country's aviation safety regulator to ensure planes don't dump human waste during flights, ruling on a plea by a New Delhi resident who claimed their neighbourhood had to endure excreta that fell from the skies.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the safety regulator, should conduct surprise checks on aircraft when they land to ensure their human-waste containers aren't empty, a three-member panel headed by Swatanter Kumar, chairperson of the National Green Tribunal said in an order.
Satwant Singh Dahiya, a resident near New Delhi's airport, filed a case in October saying houses in their neighbourhood were damaged by faeces dumped by airlines at night. In another incident, a 60-year-old woman suffered a shoulder injury in December last year probably caused by human excreta falling from the skies, the Times of India newspaper reported.
Airlines will have to pay 50,000 rupees (NZ$1000) every time their human waste tanks are found empty on landing, and the DGCA must maintain a helpline to take complaints on falling excreta, the tribunal said.
Aircraft lavatories have tanks attached to them to store waste. These are emptied at airports by the ground crew on landing. However, some excreta can be discharged mid-air in case of a leakage due to technical faults. These are converted to ice at high altitude and fall off the plane's surface.

As all infosec people know finding an unknown exploitable vulnerability is something that hooks us pretty hard. So we started to investigate that vulnerability instead of continuing to code the oclHashcat kernel. First, we tried to use the search engines to see if this problem is already publicly known. To our surprise, there were no interesting results (at the time we tried) for PostgreSQL in combination to pass-the-hash.
After that we tried to write a proof of concept (POC) to make sure our finding is real, using the latest available PostgreSQL database version from their GIT repository. That indeed worked so we decided to write a comprehensive write-up of our finding and sent it to the PostgreSQL security team and hence we handled this problem using a responsible disclosure.

Attached to this forum post is a link to our comprehensive write-up, a link to our proof of concept patch and including in our write-up a proposal for a fix in pseudocode form. As we are no professionals when it comes to handling such weaknesses we hoped that the postgres security team would take the lead over handling the issue and for example open up a CVE or starting on implementing a fix, but this did not happen.
We know that many hashcat users work professionally as pentesters or do have very good pentesting skills, hence we are pretty sure that you will "like" this pass-the-hash weakness and have some opinions to share how critical such things are.
For those of you who do not deal with PTH in a daily basis, PTH is simply a technique that allows an attacker to gain access to a system that is protected with a password but without knowing the password. So instead of cracking the hash you can use the hash itself for authentication. Simply put, (using this protocol) you do not need to know the password to log in to a PostgreSQL server even if it is "password-protected".
Finally, please note that this vulnerability is still present in all known PostgreSQL database versions.

As we are no professionals when it comes to handling such weaknesses we hoped that the postgres security team would take the lead over handling the issue and for example open up a CVE or starting on implementing a fix, but this did not happen.We know that many hashcat users work professionally as pentesters or do have very good pentesting skills, hence we are pretty sure that you will "like" this pass-the-hash weakness and have some opinions to share how critical such things are.For those of you who do not deal with PTH in a daily basis, PTH is simply a technique that allows an attacker to gain access to a system that is protected with a password but without knowing the password. So instead of cracking the hash you can use the hash itself for authentication. Simply put, (using this protocol) you do not need to know the password to log in to a PostgreSQL server even if it is "password-protected".Finally, please note that this vulnerability is still present in all known PostgreSQL database versions.Here are the links:--atomphilsmd Website Find giveen

Based on the write-up you need to just dump the credentials. Then use the md5 hash from the credentials database. There is no need to sniff the hash over the network. Although in theory you could also sniff the hash over the network and still do pth. I believe this is possible I may be wrong. From the write-up it also seems they use ssl so you would have that to deal with also. Based on the write-up you need to just dump the credentials.

You cannot do pth with the captured hashes, because H(P) is never transmitted over the wire, only H(P . R) is. Here P is the password and R is the random nonce as used in the article. Since H is a one way function you cannot recover H(P) from H(P . R) efficiently.
Edit: It seems that R is 4 bytes only, so you have 1/2^32 chance of success; the case when the nonce is the same.

Researchers say they looked at the combined effects of land use decisions and climate change because, while there are many studies of each, the two factors need to be examined together. Photo: iStock
As climate change alters habitats for birds and bees and everything in between, so too does the way humans decide to use land. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Aarhus University in Denmark have, for the first time, found a way to determine the potential combined impacts of both climate and land-use change on plants, animals and ecosystems across the country.
The study, which looks at estimates of climate and land-use change speeds, is from Jack Williams, UW–Madison professor of geography; Volker Radeloff, UW–Madison associate professor in the Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology; and postdoctoral researchers Alejandro Ordonez, from Aarhus University and UW–Madison, and Sebastian Martinuzzi, of UW–Madison. It was published today (Aug. 18, 2014) in the journal Nature Climate Change.
Jack Williams
The estimates — relevant to the first 50 years of the 21st century — provide a basis for national, regional and local policy discussions about how to conserve biodiversity and ecosystems in a rapidly changing world. Combining climate and land-use change, the researchers say, may lead to different actions than consideration of either alone.
“For conservation, as the world is changing, we want to know, how will wildlife respond,” Radeloff says. “We need to take both land use and climate into account as we look at the future.”
Volker Radeloff
For example, flat areas of the Midwest are more vulnerable to climate change than mountainous regions of the country. Conversely, areas in the northeastern U.S. may experience more intensive rates of land use. High demand for cropland in New England would lead to greater destruction of forest, while, in the upper Midwest, it would lead to slower growth of cities.
The analyses thus show different impacts for different regions. Regions exposed to high climate change rates and reductions in habitat due to more rapid land-use change may be higher priority for policy efforts than other areas. In some regions, such as the Great Plains, high rates of land-use change may actually lead to increased forest cover.
“There are lots of studies that look at climate change and a lot of studies that look at land-use change, but very few quantitatively integrate the two together,” says Williams, who is also director of the Center for Climatic Research in the UW–Madison Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies.
In their approach, the researchers used the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th Assessment Report and socioeconomic parameters from the U.S. Natural Resources Inventory to create scenarios that looked at the rate of change of both climate and land use, referred to as the speed of climate and land-use change. The land-use scenarios came from models previously developed by Radeloff and their team in 2012.
“There are lots of studies that look at climate change and a lot of studies that look at land-use change, but very few quantitatively integrate the two together.” Jack Williams
For climate, this meant looking at changes in variables like precipitation, water deficit, and temperature. For land use, it meant assessing changes to housing prices, agricultural taxes, carbon subsidies and more.
The speed of climate change in a particular place matters because it determines how quickly a given species of plant or animal must migrate from one region to another to stay within its optimal climate, or how quickly it must adapt to new conditions. Similarly, land-use speeds measure how quickly land cover changes, which can lead to new or lost habitat, species isolation, or barriers to species entering or leaving an area.
The combined scenarios are not, Williams and Radeloff say, meant to advise policymakers what to do, but rather, to show what is likely given specific changes to policy in the context of a changing climate and changing land.
It's not “what's going to happen, but a range of what might be likely,” says Radeloff. “If we change these policies, this is what's likely to happen.”
The team found that, overall, climate change has an order of magnitude more impact than land use, but the relative impact of both differs by region.
“(It's not) what's going to happen, but a range of what might be likely. If we change these policies, this is what's likely to happen.” Volker Radeloff
“Across the U.S., the rates of climate change are a big deal,” says Williams. “If we are thinking about land use and conservation planning, these results put both into perspective.”
The researchers joined forces across fields because they say the sweep of global change requires coordinated research. Change is inevitable, they say, but humans have the chance to mitigate their impact in ways that give the world's wildlife a chance to thrive.
“We won't stop climate change but maybe we can slow it … we may be able to give species time to adapt,” says Radeloff. “Now we have geese living on golf courses, but Aldo Leopold was worried they were going to go extinct. That's probably not going to happen.”
The work was supported by the Bryson Climate, People and Environment Program; the HISTFUNC project; the National Science Foundation; and NASA's Land Cover and Land Use Change Program.

Overcomplicated: Technology at the Limits of Comprehension by Samuel Arbesman
Arbesman, a complexity scientist, tells a fascinating and somewhat alarming story in Overcomplicated; as technology becomes more and more advanced, they posit, it “mimics the vagaries of the natural world more than it conforms to a mathematical model,” and starts doing things that we don't really understand.
They give examples of a number of seemingly freak accidents that technology experts are still baffled by, including the suspension of trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the recent problems with Toyota automobiles that saw them accelerating out of control.
Even the people who created the technologies we use today are surprised by the things that tech does from time to time, and that comes as a surprise to those of us who use that tech on a daily basis. And while that's a bit worrying, it also, according to Arbesman, gives us a new opportunity to look critically at the world around us, according to Arbesman. This book is sure to challenge a number of the conceptions you have about the modern world.

Rise of the Machines: A Cybernetic History by Thomas Rid
Rise of the Machines can be described in a single sentence as a “sweeping history of our deep entanglement with technology.” By looking at the history of two specific groups — those who seek to use technology to make the world a better place, and those who seek to use technology to control it — Rid shines some light on how we got to the modern technological age.
The history of cybernetics is a deep and fascinating one, beginning in World War II and continuing today; from Cold War bomber defense systems to cyberwars and beyond. Cybernetics has had an incalculable effect on humanity, and looking back at where it started and how it has progressed is a great way of preparing ourselves to look at its implications in the future.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Parts One and Two by J.K. Rowling
Even before its release Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is already the #1 bestselling book for the year, beating out big names like The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, When Breath Becomes Air, and Hamilton: The Revolution. It's a pretty big deal.
If you weren't able to check out the West End production of The Cursed Child in London, now's your chance to get caught up on the latest events in the Potter world. This book is the script of the first two parts of the play. Because it's a script, it doesn't read like a novel, and that's likely to throw a lot of people off (I can almost guarantee that a significant portion of people who have pre-ordered it doesn't realize that it's a script).
Still, it IS the next chapter in the Potter saga, full of fantastic magic and other geeky things 9 Magical Harry Potter Gadgets You Could Actually Own 9 Magical Harry Potter Gadgets You Could Actually Own Slowly but surely, science is catching up to the wonders you read about in the wonderful books written by J. K. Rowling. Yes, the Harry Potter universe is almost real. Read More , and that means a lot of geeks are going to grab it as soon as it hits the shelf.

From Freedom Football To Pro-wrestling Star
"I took off their helmet and I had their tongue in my hand," they say, remembering the incident five years ago that nearly left fellow defensive lineman Kevin Patrick, now a close friend, tongue tied.
The athlete formerly known as Dwayne Johnson is recalling with glee the tongue lashing they gave a football teammate at the University of Miami.
"It's very slippery and I wanted it. I tried to pull the guy's tongue out. I know that sounds completely sick. I just got into so much trouble then."
With a chuckle, they add: "Now, it would be great."
Then again, the athlete once identifiable as football player Dwayne Johnson of Bethlehem now practices "suplexes" and drop kicks before fake-blood-thirsty World Wrestling Federation fans as Rocky Maivia.
The 6-foot-5, 275-pound block of Bethlehem steel makes a homecoming Saturday night as a highly paid, nearly naked rookie professional wrestler known for bench pressing 425 pounds, lifting 225-pound opponents overhead with their canned-ham-sized arms and being the only third-generation wrestler in WWF history.
Part of the untelevised "United We Stand, Divided We Brawl" card 8 p.m. at Lehigh University's Stabler Arena, the 24-year-old Maivia -- son of 1980's WWF champ Rocky Johnson and grandson of the late High Chief Peter Maivia -- makes their first return to Bethlehem since leaving Freedom High School in 1990 for Miami and the national champion Hurricanes.
Maivia (pronounced My-vee-ah) matches muscle mass with Leif Cassidy, a smaller wrestler -- they almost all are compared to them -- with a Fu Manchu mustache and flowing brown tresses. The card's main event is a tag team match between Shawn Michaels/Stone Cold Steve Austin and Bret "Hit Man" Hart/Sycho Sid.
The cat never could get the tongue of the articulate Maivia, whose tale of Tongue Fu was suspect to a former coach at Freedom High School who remembered the athlete as a perfect gentleman.
Maivia recalled being thrown out of three games at Freedom for a violent on-field temper.
"It fits the image now," former Freedom assistant coach Bill Denofa says, "but they were never in trouble. They were mature beyond anyone else. The truth of the matter was, their mom (Ata) ruled the roost."
And for all Maivia's chest pumps and three-hour-a-day weightlifting and sprinting workouts, the bear-like Maivia (grizzly outside, teddy inside) revealed their favorite movie was the 10-hankie "It's a Wonderful Life."
Surely, their hobbies must be as macho as hunting rhinos, skydiving or body piercing.
Try reading quotes, fishing and cooking.
Denofa and other football coaches sensed Maivia would follow their family trail and become a wrestler. In addition to their father and grandfather, Maivia, a native of Hawaii, was nephew to WWF legend Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka, known for leaping from the top of ring ropes onto a fallen victim, and tag team champion "The Wild Samoans," who now run a professional wrestling school in Whitehall.
The 5-foot-10, 320-pound High Chief Maivia, according to family lore, threw a fellow wrestler through the glass lobby window of a Dallas hotel in 1968.
NEW DELHI: Even as their meeting with 26/11 attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed created a furore in Parliament and outside, journalist and Baba Ramdev associate Ved Prakash Vaidik said they had consented to meet the Jamaat-ud-Dawa boss purely at the behest of a journalist friend from Pakistan.“When I was in Pakistan, the media criticism of Hafiz Saeed in India came up for discussion. It was then that a Pakistani journalist asked me if I would like to meet Saeed in person. I agreed and a call was immediately made to fix the meeting,” they told TOI, denying any other motive to their appointment with the most-wanted terrorist.Refuting allegations that they had met Saeed as an envoy of the Narendra Modi government, Vaidik told TOI that their interface with the Jamaat-ud-Dawa boss was driven only by journalistic considerations. “I would like to tell Congress , which is alleging that I met them on behalf of the government, to attack the Modi regime directly rather than train its guns from my shoulders”.“I am a known name in Pakistan. My writings and articles are translated and reproduced in Pakistani media. In my 55 years of journalistic career, I have not declined to meet anyone. I have met Maoist leaders and LTTE leaders including Prabhakaran,” said Vaidik. “I wanted to analyse Saeed's mind and know why they committed heinous crimes against India,” they added.He denied being part of the Vivekananda International Foundation, with which IB chief Ajit Kumar Doval was earlier associated. This has been alleged as the reason why they were chosen to play the government's ‘envoy' to reach Saeed. “I have never been associated with the government and do not look at such association in the future. I am an independent journalist who is free to meet anyone,” they told TOI.“I have met enemies of the country in the past … my experience says resolution of conflict is possible not through the gun but talks,” they said.However, asked if they were advocating talks with Saeed, Vaidik said, “I am neither the prime minister not the government's representative…. It is for the government, Army chief , police and the courts to discharge their responsibilities in this regard,” they underlined.The issue led to two adjournments in the Rajya Sabha. Though the government said it had nothing to do with the meeting and that there was no ‘Track-2 or Track-3' diplomacy involved, opposition members led by Congress sought to link Vaidik's controversial enterprise with the BJP and highlighted Ramdev's support for Modi's prime ministerial bid.There was uproar in Lok Sabha too with members seeking response over the “purpose and motive” behind the meeting from the home minister or external affairs minister.Leader of the upper House and finance minister Arun Jaitley said for India, Saeed was a terrorist and indeed involved in terrorism against India. Government had nothing to do with “directly, indirectly or even remotely” with any journalist meeting Saeed.As the controversy refused to die down, minister of state for parliamentary affairs and environment Prakash Javadekar said, “I want to clarify that we don't approve any such activity (meeting with Saeed)”.Even as Vaidik termed their meeting with Saeed as a journalistic call, the latter tweeted: “Row in Indian Parliament over a journalist's meeting with us shows the extremism, narrow-mindedness of their (Indian) politicians…utterly shameful”.“We meet everyone with an open heart, whoever wants to meet; regardless of nation, belief or religion…Sadly, so-called ‘secular' India is unable to bear an informal meeting of their journalist, Mr Vaidik, another eg (example) of Indian narrow-mindedness,” Saeed tweeted through their official Twitter handle.Giving a peek into what transpired during the interview, Saeed said, “We discussed how all 26/11 evidences provided by India have been rejected and (I) asked Mr Vaidik why India does not respect Pakistani courts. Vaidik asked if we would protest Modi's visit to Pakistan, on which I replied, ‘We don't participate in such politics and protests'.”
Al-Aqsa Foundation for Endowment and Heritage, a Palestinian non-governmental organisation, revealed on Wednesday that Israeli security forces have closed down the Emarat Al-Aqsa organisation in the city of Nazareth, in northern Israel, after raiding its headquarters and confiscating all its properties, Anadolu news agency reported.
In a statement cited by Anadolu, Al-Aqsa Foundation explained that a large force of Israeli intelligence and police officers stormed the headquarters of Emarat Al-Aqsa and ejected all the staff, asking them to wait outside until the end of the raid.
Emarat Al-Aqsa is a non-governmental organisation that seeks to restore the status of Al-Aqsa Mosque to its historical place in the Islamic world by raising awareness about the importance of the Mosque and about the damage and dangers it continues to face. It also seeks to revive the educational process, intensifying the Muslim presence in the mosque during prayers and ensuring that Islamic occasions are being celebrated in it.
The statement described how: “During the raid, all the contents of Emarat Al-Aqsa's offices, from computers to files and documents, were seized and the director of the organisation was handed an order signed by Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon requiring the immediate closure of Emarat Al-Aqsa and a total ban on its activities.”
According to the text of the order, the Israeli authorities say the organisation “poses a threat to the security of Israel and has links with Hamas”.
The Al-Aqsa Foundation condemned the Israeli ban on Emarat Al-Aqsa's activities and the sudden closure of its offices.
Al-Aqsa Mosque is regularly subjected to incursions carried out by Israeli settlers, who tour the grounds under the armed guard of the Israeli security forces. The settlers often provoke Palestinians, sometimes resulting in the outbreak of clashes between the two sides.
According to Judaism, the site of Al-Aqsa Mosque is where the Temple of Solomon once stood, known as the First Temple and built by the Prophet Solomon.
Palestinians fear that the Israelis plan to divide Al-Aqsa Mosque in the same way that they divided the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, in the occupied West Bank. There, the Israeli authorities ordered that the mosque rotate between Muslims and Jews after an Israeli settler shot and killed 29 Muslim worshipers during dawn prayers in 1994.
The Israeli police currently allow settlers to storm Al-Aqsa Mosque by entering through the Mughrabi Gate, which is open twice daily, except on Fridays and Saturdays.
The Israeli security forces recently tightened the restrictions that have been enforced since the beginning of August on women praying at Al-Aqsa Mosque. Earlier, women were being prevented from entering before the noon prayers, but since last Sunday, the police have prevented women from entering even after the noon prayers, according to an official in the Jordanian Endowments, which has the authority to oversee Al-Aqsa Mosque.

These victories have changed the company. Once thought of as stodgy and slow, Microsoft now looks lean and agile. It stands toe-to-toe with Alphabet (the parent company of Google) in world rankings, and its NASDAQ stock price has more than doubled since 2013.
It's easy to imagine this turn-around as a victory for Windows 10, Surface, Azure, or CEO Satya Nadella, who took the reins in 2014 – and such congratulations would not be misplaced. Yet the story of Microsoft's comeback isn't just about stock prices and executive appointments. Equal credit can be given to the company's tradition of innovative research — conducted by scientists like Steven Bathiche.
Microsoft wants to give you what you need
Bathiche, an 18-year veteran of Microsoft, is tall, lanky, and seems constantly in motion, even when he's standing still. Their title of Distinguished Scientist doesn't imply any specific authority over Microsoft's Applied Sciences Group, which they lead, and it doesn't have to. Their demeanor expresses a calm, driven curiosity that instantly beckons the inner inventor.
“At the end of the day, people's needs are 1s and 0s.”
The philosophy behind their research mirrors their personable attitude. When Digital Trends sat down with them at Microsoft's campus, they wasted no time describing the core tenets that drive their team.
“Technology doesn't change what people need or want. It just changes how they meet those needs,” Bathiche explained. And what are those needs? They're what you'd expect – security, entertainment, communication.
“In the old days, when we didn't have video technology, you had people sitting around the campfire telling stories,” Bathiche said. “We went from caveman days of talking about and spreading stories to today, when you can watch video anytime, anywhere, of almost anything.” Technology may change, but people are always people, and people always want to communicate and entertain. Every revolutionary new device respects that, and finds an innovative way to fill a need.
“At the end of the day, people's needs are 1s and 0s, which is just data,” said Bathiche. “Computing technology is about people, and their information.”
Cutting-edge research, Microsoft's secret foundation
Evidence of this approach is easy to see in Microsoft's Surface line, but it didn't begin there. Bathiche first worked at Microsoft as an intern in 1995, before joining the company in 1999. Even then, they had an eye for how people use technology.
One of their first projects at Microsoft investigated how people could use inertial sensors to control 3D games. “One of the things I noticed, as I played a lot of console games, was that when people drive their kart around [in Mario Kart], they kinda lean. I thought, wouldn't it be interesting if the gaming device actually sensed that?”
Matt Smith/Digital Trends
Bathiche began prototyping a device that used accelerators as a means of input, but soon ran into challenges that went beyond the capabilities of hardware. “The thing I noticed is that when you put all the degrees of freedom into a single [device],” they explained, “it's kind of hard to use. People would mix them up.”
The solution, it turned out, was a gamepad that used sensors to control only a limited range of movement – Microsoft's Sidewinder Freestyle Pro. It was the first commercial device to use accelerometers, technology now common in all manner of electronics. Modern games that use accelerometers take a similar tact, limiting motion control movement to tilting left or right, or to another set plane of motion.
Today's gamers simply assume that motion controls will only work within a limited range, but in the late 90s, when accelerometers were rare, the right way to do it wasn't clear. A solution became clear only after experimentation with working prototypes.
This hands-on approach can be found in countless other projects, some of which were far ahead of their time. When Apple announced the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, for instance, tech enthusiasts remembered the efforts of Microsoft's Applied Sciences Group, which started research into what was internally called “Adaptive Hardware” in 1999, the year they were hired. Bathiche's own notes, which imagine a keyboard using a “strip of electronic paper” over dome key switches, are immortalized on the Group's website.
Surface first appeared in 2007, not as a 2-in-1, but as an interactive table.
No consumer device was birthed directly from that idea, but that doesn't mean the research was pointless. The experimentation led by Bathiche's team is needed to separate revolutionary ideas from interesting duds. It's hard to tell which will be which, even after years of iteration.
“The original Surface was a perfect example,” said Bathiche. “It was the first mixed reality device. You had a computer understanding what was happening on the surface, you had objects you could put on top. You had this virtual-physical object interaction that could happen.”
Surface first appeared in 2007 not as a 2-in-1, but as an interactive table. Codenamed Milan, it used cameras connected to the table to help it respond to touch, or even objects laid on the table's surface. It was a fun concept that made for great demos, but its best use didn't become clear until years later.
“A touchscreen is in fact a spatial camera,” Bathiche told us, helping to draw the connection. “It's trying to see your intent on the screen, and it maps that to a virtual thing.” The technology in today's Surface Pro is far more precise, and far smaller, than anything in the Milan concept — but a PC built for direct interaction, through touch and through objects, was always the goal.
Microsoft could've thrown in the towel after Milan, deciding it was too heavy, too large, too complex. Instead it played the long game, and remained faithful that people want to interact more directly with their PC, even if no one knew exactly what that'd look like in practice.
“We realized when we had heavy competition from Apple, that we had to innovate in the PC space,” Bathiche recalled. “That recognition happened. It happened with [former CEO] Steve Ballmer, it happened with [former President of the Windows Division] Steven Sinofsky. They saw this team […] and said ‘let's go build a new computer.'”
Building tomorrow's PC, piece by piece
The success of Surface has given the company's design excellence well-deserved attention, and the sudden appearance of its cutting-edge PCs left many wondering what changed. The answer, according to Bathiche, is nothing.
“People think that we're kind of new to hardware,” they said. “We've been doing hardware for 30 years. Maybe we're new to building computers, but not really, we've been doing it now for six or seven years. If you count the original Surface table we've been doing it for a decade.”
In fact, Microsoft has shipped hardware from its infancy. The company's Hardware Division, founded in 1982, crafted its first mouse in 1983 and has since worked on everything from PC speakers to interactive toys. This experience came invaluable when Microsoft decided to commit itself to a game console. “The only reason the company was able to ship [Xbox] within a year,” Bathiche said, “was because they had a hardware division. Those people who shipped Xbox were the people who were building mice, keyboards, gaming devices.”

Importantly, this expertise is practical. “We build functional prototypes, and then we try it, and we put people in front of it,” Bathiche told us – and followed up with a whirlwind tour through the company's prototyping facility. Their team doesn't have to wait to implement an idea, because everyone works just a few feet away from a small-scale production line that includes 3D printers, CNC machines, and a collection of premium materials, such as the Alcantara that's become part of the Surface brand.
“This was hard,” Bathiche said proudly of the Surface Laptop's fabric interior. “No one's done this before, putting fabrics on a keyboard with new frayed edges.” Such innovation is only possible because Microsoft puts its innovators in front of the tools they need to produce a working prototype that looks very much like the final product. “Everything is prototyped here first. That's how we do all our new concepts. Which I think is an important distinction – not all computer companies do that.”
Satya Nadella, in a 2014 memo, mandated that “each engineering group will have Data and Applied Science resources that will focus on measurable outcomes for our products and predictive analysis of market trends.”
Now, Microsoft is taking that a step further by putting its Devices Design Team under the same roof as the Applied Sciences Group. The new space, which is under construction at Microsoft Building 87, will have the inventive geniuses at the Group work side-by-side with the creative minds that imagined Surface's unique look.
What do you do after you invent the next PC? You do it again
The release of Surface has given the Applied Sciences Group plenty to do, and Bathiche remains interested in tearing down the barriers between man and machine. The pen, for instance, remains a key focus. “On the hardware side, we want to innovate to be like paper. On the software side, we want to be better than paper, we want to go beyond paper.”
Bathiche and their team is looking forward to its newest horizon, a concept called Ambient Computing.
Yet success hasn't bound the Group to Microsoft's new hardware. Instead, Bathiche and their team is looking forward to its newest horizon, a concept called Ambient Computing. They see a future where advanced sensors and artificial intelligence will combine to make the PC ever-present, usable even when you're nowhere near a keyboard, mouse, or screen.
“The big evolution today […] is this new layer of intelligence. This takes the information people have generated, with their hardware devices, using applications as a media, and helps you intuit on that information, makes it work on your behalf.” Bathiche went on to say Microsoft wants “to create a vicious cycle of people and their information. The more information we can help people communicate, the more we'll be able to intuit, the more value we'll be able to create for the person.”
Prototypes of this, which are already underway, remain under wraps, but Microsoft's last Build conference hinted at what's next. There, the company showed several high-concept demos, including a workplace where computers identified workers by sight and sound, and could even determine when a worker picked up equipment they aren't certified to use. Such a network of sensors and intelligence could, in many situations, erase the need for a physical interface altogether, removing one more barrier between PC and user. Computers could transition away from a device you use and instead become a constant companion.
That, of course, ties right back into the mission of Microsoft's Applied Sciences Group, and Bathiche's philosophy of needs and wants. The world has become used to the idea of physical electronic devices, but nothing about our needs or wants demands we sit down in front of a PC – for most uses, at least. Bypassing the hardware may seem a dangerous proposition for Microsoft, but the company wants to make the next leap forward – whatever that might be — before anyone else. “We try to invent new ways you talk to the computer, and the computer talks back to you,” Bathiche said, “because we want to invent the next computer.”
A recent study has implicated the nucleus accumbens of the ventral striatum in explaining why online-users spend time on the social network platform Facebook. Here, higher activity of the nucleus accumbens was associated with gaining reputation on social media. In the present study, we touched a related research field. We recorded the actual Facebook usage of N = 62 participants on their smartphones over the course of five weeks and correlated summary measures of Facebook use with gray matter volume of the nucleus accumbens. It appeared, that in particular higher daily frequency of checking Facebook on the smartphone was robustly linked with smaller gray matter volumes of the nucleus accumbens. The present study gives additional support for the rewarding aspects of Facebook usage. Moreover, it shows the feasibility to include real life behavior variables in human neuroscientific research.
In the alarmingly beige conference room of a Beverly Hills hotel, the man who helped launch six princesses, more than a dozen musical films, and a national songbook of singalongs sits down at a piano.
And immediately “beige” is no longer accurate.
With just a few immediately evocative chords from Oscar-, Grammy- and Tony-winning composer Alan Menken, an equally familiar voice rises in glorious crescendo.
“Perfect adored paragooooon,” sings Josh Gad with that unmistakable combination of bravado and vibrato. It's a sound they honed as Elder Cunningham in the original Broadway production of “The Book of Mormon,” made ubiquitous with their portrayal of “Frozen's” beloved snowman Olaf and now brought to Disney's new live action film “Beauty and the Beast.”
Gad, of course, is neither Beauty nor the Beast; he's singing LeFou, the bumbling buddy of the story's self-obsessed villain Gaston, played by Luke Evans, who gamely answers the musical call and harmonizes with Gad's high note.
“We live in the clouds,” Gad jokes about their range. The many fans already following the duo's singing Instagrams will not be surprised to know that the Evans and Gad pairing has already been praised as the film's standout performance.
But before they can get into the next verse Evans stops; he's forgotten the chorus. “So what's the line?” they ask. “‘No one's quick as Gaston, no one's thick as Gaston'?”
Menken, at the piano, shoots Evans a phony look of disbelief, and loudly reminds the room that he'd handed out the lyrics to everyone earlier. The composer, of course, not only wrote the score for “Beauty and the Beast” (with lyrics by the late Howard Ashman), but also “The Little Mermaid,” “Aladdin,” “Enchanted,” “Little Shop of Horrors” and many others.
“I don't know the lyrics because I don't sing them,” Evans pleads. Gad, as helpful as their on-screen character, rapidly recites the lyrics from their villainous tribute.
It's a chain reaction that brings Menken back to the piano, and Evans into full Gaston mode. Chest out, head back, they blossom into a man who most certainly would use antlers in all of their decorating. And, sheesh, were their shoulders this big a moment ago?
The magic is real; it feels like a rowdy 17th century tavern in here, if only for a while. That has been the concern all along, whether the live action film could recapture the thrill of the original film. From the moment Menken's swirling, delicate refrain danced with the foreboding bass of the animated film's prologue, the audience knew something special was coming. Twenty-five years later, that same feeling of anticipation is back, conjured, with the aid of one piano, by three guys in a conference room having a grand time talking about the next generation of “Beauty and the Beast.”
Because if it's not baroque…
This is a musical brain trust, Luke Evans, Josh Gad and Alan Menken the Disney legend, the Broadway legend…
Evans: Oscar-winning… Tony-winning.
Gad: You are, you're a legend. You're more than that. How many awards do you have, can you even count them at this point?
Menken: Awards in total?
Gad: Yes. And they can include high school awards. You've got to be a Guinness record holder.
Menken: All I'll say is I do not have the E from EGOT. Except I have an honorary E. And I got an R for Razzie. Worst song of the year!
Gad: Somehow all I've got is the G. I won the Grammy and nothing else.
Menken: You didn't get the Tony for “Mormon”?
Gad: We don't talk about it. Moving on. Moving on.
Menken: You damn well should've.
Gad: Oh I love you, Menken.

What was it like seeing the characters you wrote music for in the flesh on screen singing your music?
Menken: It was great, it was amazing. It's been a long process and we turned into kind of the “Beauty and the Beast” family. It's wonderful, it's ... A dream come true.[Begins to hum and play the piano]
Josh and Luke, how did it feel when you found out you were going to perform Menken's music?
Gad: I was 10 years old when “Beauty and the Beast” came out. The distinct, vivid memory that I have is sitting in a theater in South Florida, and the audience breaking out into applause at the end of “Gaston,” at the end of “Be Our Guest” and, of course, at the end of the ballroom dance of “Beauty and the Beast.” And that left this indelible impression on me. Those songs are the soundscape to my childhood, and now to my own kids. So being able to bring one to life is incredible.
Evans: I was 12 years old. I came out [of the movie] humming the tunes, didn't know the lyrics. Waited for the album to come out, got my mum to buy it for me. Read the little booklet, learned all the songs and then the show came out, the Broadway show. It came to London, I saw it opening night. So it's part of my life the whole way through. It is like a soundtrack to one's life, isn't it?
Is there a particular line that you sing that made you feel like a kid again while you were singing?
Evans: Mine has to be, [sings] “I'm especially good at expectorating…”
Menken: “Tooey! Ten points for Gaston!”
Gad: I remember the first time practicing, when I found out I got the role. The first time I rehearsed it by myself, I was in my office and I was singing it. I had a friend, Rory O'Malley, staying above me on the second floor. They come downstairs and they go, “That's such an interesting audition song to choose. What are you singing for?” And I go, “Actually playing LeFou in the new ‘Beauty and the Beast.'”
It was so out of body and surreal to be singing this song that I grew up so reverential of, and the songs that you and Howard wrote. Whether it's “Gaston,” whether it's “Be Our Guest,” or whether it's, “Friend Like Me,” or “Part of your World,” those songs take you to a place and a time, and I can remember every screening that I went to of each of those movies. Those songs defined that experience. So thank you, Menken. You deserve all 3,000 awards that you've won. Am I in the right ballpark?
Menken: Give or take.

What does it take to write a great villain song?
Menken: Stay true to character and stay true to the story. You don't think “villain song," you think it's a song for this character who's got this emotion, who's got this intention. And you have to think, is it going to be a song like “Hellfire,” [from “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”], which is not comedic in the slightest, or is it going to be like “Gaston” or the “Dentist” song from “Little Shop [of Horrors”], which intend to be hilarious. Villains always come in a lot of shapes and sizes and just got to serve you well.
Evans: That's right. Serve me well.
Gad: The first villain song that I remember seeing in a Disney movie was actually Ursula's in “Little Mermaid.” [Sings] “I'm afraid in the past I've been a baddie. Na na ... well a witch.” Which when you play it off the piano sounds like something you would hear at a temple on Yom Kippur. At that time, I feel like there weren't a lot of villain songs. Was that a new sort of twist that you guys played?
Menken: There weren't a lot of theatrically structured Disney animated movies, or hadn't been for a generation. So in reaching out to Howard Ashman, and me, to come and do “Little Mermaid,” there was overt desire to have musical theater transferred to Disney. Certainly there were a lot of music-theater smarts in “Pinocchio” or other Disney classics, but we were a different generation. I always say I think “Little Mermaid” is Howard's and my follow-up to “Little Shop of Horrors.” Some people call “Part Of Your World, “Somewhere That's Wet.” We kind of delved into, “What is the Disney ethos?” Part of the Disney ethos is bringing in very specific musical styles. So for “Mermaid” we brought the sea shanty to Brecht and Weill for that scene. That's really what “Poor Unfortunate Souls” is, very Brecht and Weill. German cabaret and calypso.
Evans: Do you remember which song you wrote first [for “Beauty and the Beast”]?
Menken: I think it was “Belle” and Howard was terrified. Howard did not want to send the song on to Disney. They said, “Who asked for a six and half minute opening number? Are we crazy?” They literally said, “This is going to get around, people are going to laugh at us.” I said, “I think it's really good, Howard. I think it's really good.” They were tearing their hair out. And in those days you couldn't just send an MP3 and an hour later, “Oh my God, it's great!” You stuck it in the mail and waited. And they loved it. I believe that was the first one. That and “Be Our Guest.”

There's lots of new music in the live action film. The Beast has a new song and Belle has a song and Gaston has a song. But LeFou doesn't have a song.
Gad: Yeah, what's that about? I've been meaning to ask you the same thing.
Menken: Well…
Gad: You were holding it for the sequel.
Menken: I'm writing a whole musical for you, Josh. We're doing a project that is actually a Josh Gad vehicle.
But what would a LeFou song sound like, what do you think they would want?
Menken: You can't just serve characters. What you're serving is the story. Where would LeFou's song moment be?
Gad: I know what it would be. [Sings] “Food, glorious food.”
Menken: Frankly, much of Gaston is LeFou.
Evans: And is sung by LeFou.
Gad: The reason that I did the movie is because that song is such, it really is a duet. It's an amazing duet, but it's LeFou's hero worship of this guy. He's like a historian and celebrates this guy's legacy and that's what makes it so funny. And thank you for raising it an octave for Luke and me, because now we have to sing it live all the time.
Evans: That is our own fault. The curse of the two tenors.

You revived a lot of old lyrics that were lost for this movie. What was that like hearing those lyrics again?
Menken: Great. That was great. And also, hearing at the end of the movie, the long lost verse from “Beauty and the Beast” that Howard wrote. Oh man.
I gotta say, [director] Bill Condon is really smart. Because it was really Bill who reached in and said, “I want to do that.” That was huge, Bill having that curiosity and willingness to open it up. There is a little treasure-trove of lost Ashman that's wonderful.
When you're actually filming “Gaston” what were the director's notes? Did they say, “Don't worry about going too big?” What's the balance between villainy and comedy?
Evans: There was a lot of, there was a lot of…
Gad: I think she's just saying we mugged it.
Evans: You mean we were theatrical about our performances? We had a lot of rehearsal. So we worked out the level and the size of our performances from the rehearsal room. Because it is a larger-than-life moment, in the film there's this huge group of people being rallied by one to make the ego of another feel grand. And so there is a very sort of jolly atmosphere in that room and everybody's had a beer or two and music is playing. I think we had a license to be a little larger than we would have been outside of the tavern because the tavern was a place of frivolity and happiness.
Gad: I remember one of my favorite songs growing up. Have you guys seen the original ‘Pete's Dragon'? When they're going to the tavern and [Mickey Rooney is singing], “A dragon, a dragon, I swear I saw a dragon.” That sort of felt like that was the spirit of what we were doing. The song is so infectious that you want people to watch it and feel like they want to be in this tavern and jump onto the table and sing Gaston's praises alongside you.
Menken: Also, Howard's lyrics are hilarious. I actually found recordings of me working — because I used to keep them on cassette — and I get to, “Every last inch of me's covered with hair.” And I just crack up, I just stop. “I use antlers in [all of my decorating].” Imagine, looking at that lyric for the first time. You had to know Howard too, they were just beating Gaston senseless. And it was delicious.
It's a very happy villain song as well, it's hard not to get caught up in it.
Menken: You know it may be one of the happiest villain songs ever, it's true.
Evans: I was watching the audience [at the recent premiere], everyone's really into that scene. There were people just moving along. It just rouses everyone.
Menken: They love Gaston. They did applaud when you died.
Evans: They applauded when I died.
Gad: I led the applause.
Evans: You did. You whooped along. I didn't even hit the ground and you were already clapping.
Gad: My daughter said, “Daddy, why are you laughing, he's horrible.”
Evans: Right here [points to chest]. It was wonderful.

The UPS Store Makes 3D Printing Accessible to Start-Ups and Small Business Owners
San Diego, July 31, 2013
The UPS Store® today announced it is the first nationwide retailer to test 3D printing services in-store. Select UPS Store locations will be offering the services to start-ups, small businesses and retail customers, beginning in the San Diego area with locations in additional cities across the United States in the near future.
A recent poll of small business owners conducted by The UPS Store showed high interest in trying the services, particularly for those needing to create prototypes, artistic renderings or promotional materials.
"Start-ups, entrepreneurs and small business owners may not have the capital to purchase a 3D printer on their own, but they may have a need to show prototypes to their current and potential customers," said Michelle Van Slyke, vice president of marketing and small business solutions at The UPS Store. "By offering 3D printing capabilities in-center, we're able to help further our small business customers' opportunities for success."
The UPS Store is testing the Stratasys uPrint SE Plus printer, which according to Stratasys is most well-known for its ability to print detailed objects more accurately than home 3D printers. Stratasys notes that this is particularly important when parts need to fit into each other or fit some other object. With this printer, The UPS Store locations will be equipped to produce items like engineering parts, functional prototypes, acting props, architectural models, fixtures for cameras, lights and cables.
In addition, The UPS Store locations offer a range of services tailored to meet the needs of small businesses in all stages of the business lifecycle. Not only can small business owners receive well-recognized services like packing and shipping, printing, faxing, direct mail and mailbox services, but The UPS Store locations also will work with business owners to develop custom solutions to meet their unique business needs.
For more information on how The UPS Store supports small businesses, visit the Small Business Solutions portal at smallbiz.theupsstore.com.
Poll Methodology
The results of the poll are based on a national online poll with small business owners. The poll was conducted with 86 small business owners between June 3 and June 17, 2013. The sample was drawn from Small Biz Buzz, The UPS Store private online community of small business owners.
If you're on the shorter end of the height spectrum, you know how frustrating it can be to take a stroll with someone who's tall. At times, you might have to remind your companion to slow down, that your shorter legs can't keep up. This might have been an even bigger problem for our famous ancestor, Lucy. Within the species Australopithecus afarensis, there was considerable variability in height and limb length, and different members of the species may have had vastly different preferences for walking speeds, new research suggests. How did our ancestors cope with such a dilemma?
The problem really became apparent in 2010 with the discovery of a partial A. afarensis skeleton, nicknamed “Big Man,” in Ethiopia. As their name suggests, the five-foot-tall Big Man was big, at least for an early hominid, and compared to the three-and-a-half-foot-tall Lucy. Big Man's shin, for instance, was about 50 percent longer than that of Lucy's—the sort of length difference you see today between a six-year-old child and a six-foot-tall man. But in Lucy and Big Man's case, both individuals were adults, suggesting there was a large range of heights for A. afarensis. The variation might have been related to sex, with males being significantly taller than females. Or there might have been regional differences in A. afarensis size. Lucy and Big Man were both found in Ethiopia but at different sites.
To understand the walking behavior of Lucy, Big Man and their kind, Patricia Ann Kramer of the University of Washington in Seattle did some experiments with people. In modern humans, the length of the lower leg (or tibia) plays a big role in how much energy a person expends while walking and what his/her preferred speed is. Kramer examined this relationship by measuring the tibia length of 36 children and 16 adults and then placing the volunteers on treadmills to record how much energy they used (measured in terms of oxygen consumption) while walking at different speeds. They discovered that, in general, individuals with longer lower legs have higher “optimal velocities.” That means the speed at which longer-legged people consume the least amount of energy is faster than that of shorter-legged people.
Kramer used the data to create a mathematical equation that related leg length to speed to estimate Lucy's and Big Man's optimal velocities based on their tibia lengths. Lucy's would have been 1.04 meters per second (about 3.4 feet per second) while Big Man's would have been as much as 1.33 meters per second (about 4.4 feet per second). To put this in perspective, if both individuals walked for an hour at their optimal speeds, Lucy would have covered 3.74 kilometers (2.3 miles) while Big Man would have traversed 4.68 kilometers (2.9 miles), Kramer reports in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.
Based on two individuals, it's hard to say how representative these results are for A. afarensis. And even assuming there were big differences in walking speeds, it's hard to say how it would have affected the behavior of these early hominids. If size differences were sex based, then some members of a group might have had to compromise their preferred walking speed—perhaps females had to walk faster (and thus expend more energy) to keep up with males or maybe males slowed down (also expending more energy) to appease females or maybe both sexes had to adjust their velocities. Another possibility is that males and females spent time away from each other during the day, Kramer says. Among wild chimpanzees, males and females often range separately while searching for food, which might be a consequence of different walking speeds. More studies that examine sex-based ranging patterns in primates might offer more clues to how A. afarensis could have coped. Of course, this variation in height might not have been a problem at all if differences were largely regional.
Although Kramer's work doesn't provide any definite answers, it highlights how difficult it is to reconstruct the biology and behavior or our ancestors. It's clear that A. afarensis walked upright, but we still have a lot to learn about how the early hominid traveled across the East African landscape.
Google
Google is reaching across the globe to teach more people digital skills.
The US-based tech giant said Thursday that it plans to teach 10 million people in Africa online skills over the next five years to make them more employable. It'll also be providing mobile developer training to 100,000 people in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.
This comes after Google said in March that it had given digital training to more than 1 million people in the region. In April 2016, the company initially launched its program to train people in digital and software skills in Africa.
Africa, with a population of 1.2 billion, is one of the world's fastest growing continents. It's expected to have 1.1 billion people of working age by 2034, but not nearly enough jobs to fit that demand, according to Google.
"The internet, and technology as a whole, offer great opportunities for creating jobs, growing businesses and boosting economies," Google wrote in a blog post. "But people need the right skills, tools and products to navigate the digital world and to make it work for them, their businesses and their communities."
Google didn't respond to a request for comment.
Launched alongside the October 2014 Premium Membership offer, but available to all SL users, is the Haunted Halloween Tour, the latest offering from the Lab to feature Experience Keys, and one that appears to be specifically geared towards the Oculus Rift.
The tour can be accessed via the Lab's Portal Park – simply go through the gate marked “Halloween” following your arrival. The path will lead you to the access point, with gateways available for those with and those without an Oculus headset (the latter obviously requiring the Oculus Rift project viewer).
Whichever one you take (the actual tours are more-or-less the same), the first time you do so, you'll be required to grant the experience the right to carry out certain actions on your avatar (perhaps most noticeably in this case, control your camera). Once you have done so, you'll be transported to the experience area, where you'll be invited to take a tour of a veritable house of horror.
This is achieved by seating yourself in your very own coffin, which will take control of your camera and shift your view to something of a “first person” perspective. After a brief pause, you'll then ascend a hillside stairway through thunder and rain to the house itself before (literally) plunging inside.
I shan't reveal much of what lies inside the house, other than given the theme, expect the usual mix of screams, bumps, ghouls, body parts and so on – and if you're very lucky the odd Linden and / or Mole or two, some of whom might be there to menace, while others might be simply …. hanging around.
This is very much an Experience geared towards the Oculus Rift, with the coffin allowing the awkwardness of trying to navigate oneself through the house while wearing one eliminated (and which also ensures you keep to the designated path). As such, the ride does feature a lot of things rushing at you (heads, knife-welding asylum patients and so on), and well as sudden panning, zooming and tipping to add to the experience.
For those with an Oculus, I expect this does work rather well; I'm just not sure the approach works when taking the “non-Oculus” version of the ride. This isn't to critique the Lab for providing an Oculus focused experience; they've put time and effort into getting the viewer to work with the headset and so a demonstrator is only right and proper. It's just that it leaves the tour somewhat dry if you don't have a headset. Or at least it did for me – I confess found myself admiring the use of materials and projectors far more than anything else as I was carried around the place!
Oh, and a word of warning to those on the non-Oculus ride: it might be an idea not to try to cam around too much in order to take snaps – on two occasions when I did, I found myself chucked out of my coffin and returned to the arrival / start point below the house …
Overall, the ride lasts for around 8 minutes, and at the end of it, on stepping out of your coffin, you'll be returned to the Portal Park (as you will be if you stand up at any point during the ride).

According to Variety magazine, Fox 2000 is close to finalizing a deal that will unite the talents of media matriarchs Angelina Jolie and Patricia Cornwell. Patricia Cornwell is the author of the best-selling series of crime mysteries based on the character Dr. Kay Scarpetta, a sleuthing former medical examiner, to be played by Jolie.
There are 16 Scarpetta novels, meaning a franchise is hoped for, but this film won't be tied to a specific Cornwell mystery title. Much the way that Jason Bourne morphed into an action hero in plots not rigidly locked into the Robert Ludlum book series, the opera-loving coroner Scarpetta will be the lead in a suspense thriller in the vein of “The Silence of the Lambs” and “Seven.”
Patricia Cornwell, whose most recent novel “Scarpetta ” was published four months ago, is notoriously protective of their work, and it reportedly took meeting with Jolie and their manager Geyer Kosinski to convince the author to allow the project to go ahead.
Jolie and Cornwell seem like a perfect pairing to me – you have one of Hollywood's biggest box office draws signing on to a franchise that doesn't require perpetual youth and already has at least 16 well-written stories waiting. (Let's be honest, the sexist ageism of moviegoers will allow for a sixty-five-year-old Indiana Jones, but the same can't be said for Lara Croft) I look forward to renting a DVD and grossing out my grandkids by remarking how hot Angelina Jolie looks without them reading glasses. (Would that make me a Dr. Scarpettaphile?)
Unique Bacterial Chemist in the War on Potatoes
In fertile farm soils where potatoes grow, Streptomyces scabies bacteria wage war using chemicals related to explosives and pesticides.
But a microbial spoiler defuses one of S. scabies' poisons. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have gained new insights into a one-of-a-kind mechanism it employs, which could someday contribute to the development of new agents to degrade tough pollutants and help rescue crops.
When S. scabies infects potatoes, it spews poisons called thaxtomins, which riddle potatoes with familiar dark scabs. Perhaps a trifle to the potato connoisseur excising them with a paring knife, on a global scale, the blemishes add up to a slash in agricultural production.
Unprecedented moves
Scientists investigating potato soil found that bacteria of the species Bradyrhizobium sp. JS329 run interference. Though their tough enzymes don't break down thaxtomins, they do render innocuous another S. scabies toxic secretion called 5-nitroanthranilic acid (5-NAA).
Still, understanding how it is broken down could prove useful to agriculture. “The 5NAA molecule is similar enough to thaxtomin that studying its degradation might inspire future work to engineer an enzyme or bacterium, or even the plant itself, to detoxify thaxtomin,” Lieberman said.
One enzyme in particular uses seemingly unprecedented and spectacular chemical tricks to tear apart 5-NAA's otherwise ironclad chemical structure.
Researchers uncovered them and published the results in the journal Nature Chemical Biology on Monday, October 3, 2016. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation, Pew Charitable Trusts, Georgia Internship for Teachers, and the U.S. Department of Energy.
Chemical warfare
S. scabies bacteria are masters of chemical warfare, and not just against potatoes.
“This family of bacteria is known for the ability to synthesize lots of different molecules, including ones that humans use as antibiotics,” said senior researcher Raquel Lieberman, an associate professor at Georgia Tech's School of Chemistry and Biochemistry.
“They're good at killing other organisms,” they said. Though the thaxtomins they secrete are well-known for marring potatoes, little is known about toxin 5NAA.
Enzymatic kung fu
5NAA has met its match in bacterium Bradyrhizobium sp. JS329, which we'll call “Brady” for short.
“Brady” produces enzymes that can combat 5NAA, the first of which is called 5NAA-A. The added “A” after the dash stands for “aminohydrolase,” a term that means it uses water to alter part of toxin 5NAA.
The “substitution reaction” that enzyme 5NAA-A carries out is common in organic synthesis, but extremely rare in living things. “There's only one other known enzyme confirmed to utilize this particular chemical mechanism,” Lieberman said.
Lieberman's team, which specializes in making protein crystals of enzymes like 5NAA-A, observed the moment of the ensuing reaction. “We were able to capture the critical step (hydrolysis) in the crystal for this paper,” they said.
“It does this wacko chemical reaction,” Lieberman said. 5NAA-A helps destroy toxin 5NAA in two ways that are like outlandish kung fu moves.
Breaking the wrong arm
Toxin 5NAA enters the “Brady” bacterium with a deadly weapon. A nitro group, or NO2, is part of its structure, which makes 5NAA a nitroaromatic compound.
“Basically, all these nitroaromatics are either explosive or toxic,” Lieberman said. “TNT is not that different from this compound.”
Plenty of bacteria have evolved enzymes to tackle synthetic nitroaromatics -- pollutants like dyes, pesticides or explosives that have been dumped in our environment. The enzymes tend to use the same strategy. “The nitro groups are typically the first target of any degrading enzyme, because they are so toxic,” Lieberman said.
Not so for enzyme 5NAA-A.
It goes after another group on the toxic molecule, the amine, which is innocuous. It's like a kung fu master breaking the arm opposite of the one with the weapon. But it works.
By hydrolyzing the amine, enzyme 5NAA-A sets up toxin 5NAA for destruction by other enzymes. “The fact that it does it without removing the nitro is the weird part. It's an unexpected move,” Lieberman said.
Kryptonite suicide
Then there's the weirdness around metal.
5NAA-A is a metalloprotease, an enzyme that needs a metal ion to do its work. But unlike other metalloproteases, it doesn't have one embedded in it. It can operate with one of four different metals, but 5NAA-A can't seem to find the metal on its own.
“It relies on 5NAA to bring it to the party,” Lieberman said.
In other words, poison 5NAA seems to tow a metal ion up to enzyme 5NAA-A, which then takes it away and uses it to destroy the poison. It's like Superman handing off kryptonite to an arch enemy.
“At least that's very much what we think is happening,” Lieberman said. “We're going to investigate the details further.”
Solitary master
The sum of 5NAA-A's weird ways led Lieberman's team to check an enormous genome database for matches of the gene sequence that can produce an enzyme like 5NAA-A. They found only one single known other example on Earth.
“That enzyme gene sequence comes from sediment in Yellowstone National Park,” Lieberman said. It is not yet confirmed that bacteria housing it actually detoxify 5NAA, though it's likely.
Even if it does, enzyme 5NAA-A remains uncommonly rare, given the myriad microbes on Earth producing an even higher number of enzymes. “The fact that there may just be one other is mind-boggling,” Lieberman said.
High school researchers
In another rarity, a high school science teacher is one of the authors on the research paper. Casey Bethel, who was named Georgia Teacher of the Year for 2017, helped the other researchers break through a barrier that was holding up progress.
“We use so-called tags to identify the enzyme we're interested in when we go to harvest it. We suspected the tags were interfering in the crystallization process,” Bethel said. So, they cloned the proteins with removable tags, which significantly helped the project move forward.
Bethel participates in Georgia Tech's main K-12 outreach, CEISMC, which, among other things, boosts STEM education among underserved populations in Georgia public schools. And for three years, CEISMC has helped them improve their teaching skills.
Bethel has also brought high school students to work in Lieberman's lab with him. He's thrilled that they -- and they -- could be a part of the study. “Fantastical! Unimaginable! Who'd think that a high school teacher would be published in a Nature journal?” Bethel said.
Since starting with Georgia Tech's outreach, Bethel has seen at least 60 of their former students choose STEM studies and careers. “Whereas before, the number was close to zero,” they said. “It's indescribable. It's momentous, magnificent and impactful. I'll never be able to measure the impact.”

At 51zero we pride ourselves on being flexible when it comes to language choice. Java, Scala, C#, and more recently, Kotlin. Kotlin is a JVM language developed by Jetbrains (the people behind IntelliJ amongst other things) and recently has just reached version 1.0 public. We've even ported ScalaTest over to Kotlin in the guise of KotlinTest (of which we'll do a blog soon).
There are some great articles already published on the main features of Kotlin, for example here, here and here, which are useful introductions for Java developers wishing to look at a different language. This blog is for Scala developers interested in having a play with Kotlin, where we review features of Scala you use every day, and their equivalents, or closest features, are in Kotlin.
Data classes vs Case classes
One of the main selling points of Scala when you first start to use it over Java is the use of case classes to take away all the boilerplate from Java beans. (Quite why Java didn't add this years ago I have no idea, surely the addition of an annotation that the compiler can pick up on wouldn't break existing code). But anyway, Kotlin has the same case class functionality in the form of data classes. The minor difference is that Kotlin won't automatically infer the constructor parameters to be fields, so you must declare them as either val or var. Eg, the following scala case class:
1. Buffy the Vampire Slayer came out at an interesting time in the horror genre. Joss Whedon stated that they wrote Buffy as a response to the helpless damsels in distress characters they saw in typical horror films, as they felt women needed better screen idols to look up to. Buffy debuted just a year after Scream, a film that heavily commented on the sexist representations of women in horror cinema. Sarah Michelle Gellar would appear in Scream 2 and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Both were penned by 90's screenwriting wunderkind Kevin Williamson, who was also behind Dawson's Creek.
2. Before accepting the role of Buffy, Sarah Michelle Gellar was also up for the part of Sabrina Spellman in Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. In landing Buffy Summers, they beat out Selma Blair and Katie Holmes, who both ended up on other WB shows — Dawson's Creek and Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane. (Blair also got to be the voice on the phone when Gellar is murdered in Scream 2, which is a consolation prize, I think.) Gellar initially auditioned for Cordelia, but Whedon and company felt they would make a better Buffy. Good choice.
3. One of the things that prompted Joss Whedon to make a TV version of Buffy was their feeling that the movie version was bungled, as too much of the original script was rewritten. (Donald Sutherland improvised a lot of their scenes, which Whedon felt made the dialogue lack coherence. Joss now refers to Donald Sutherland as a “dick.”) In the movie version, Buffy states that their four life goals are to “graduate, go to Europe, marry Christian Slater and die,” and through the TV version, they achieve three of those four things. (Slater unfortunately starred in Interview with the Vampire instead of cavorting with Buffy Summers. Jerk.)
4. Although Whedon states that the film version should not be treated as canon, there are a number of interesting connections with the movie version. Kristine Sutherland, who plays Mrs. Summers (#neverforget), created their stage name as a tribute to Donald Sutherland, the “dick” who plays the original watcher. Seth Green and Ben Affleck both appear in the original film, although Green's part was cut down to that of a glorified extra. Affleck officially entered the Buffyverse in a Season Three episode of Angel in an uncredited role. Buffy the Vampire Slayer was future two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank's first film role, but they have yet to come back to Whedon. I guess she's all booked up with dat New Year's Eve and P.S. I Love You. Busy, busy.
5. Another almost casting fact from the movie: Alyssa Milano and Joan Chen were both originally slated to appear in the film, before the roles went to Kristy Swanson and Paul Ruebens instead. Chen had already starred in Twin Peaks, David Lynch's deliciously quirky cult phenomenon, and Milano later was cast in Charmed. Both of these shows share a very similar audience with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Charmed featured Twin Peaks' Grace Zabriskie and Billy Zane and Buffy's Charisma Carpenter in multiple-episode arcs.
6. Charisma Carpenter also auditioned for Buffy, as did Julie Benz, Mercedes McNab, Julia Lee and Elizabeth Anne Allen, who all pop up on the show in other roles. Whedon regular (and sex on legs) Nathan Fillion tried out for Spike, and another actor was originally meant to play the part of Anya. They declined the role when they found out the character only had a two-episode arc, and Emma Caufield was cast instead. Anya proved such a popular character that they would be upgraded to a series regular. This is why you never say no to Joss Whedon. You will be sorry.
7. Carpenter was one of the few actors to recur on both Buffy and Angel, playing Cordelia Chase for seven years before they were eventually killed off in Angel's 100th episode (after being in a coma for some time). Them 86-ing came after prolonged creative and personal differences with Joss Whedon, matters that also included Carpenter's pregnancy. Carpenter only agreed to appear in the 100th episode if Cordelia didn't die, and only found out after the signing the contract for the episode that they would, indeed. Despite their love for Joss, Carpenter states that their relationship became incredibly strained after that incident, which got even worse when they were not invited to be a part of Dr. Horrible. (She assumed they would be, but Felicia Day was cast instead.) Carpenter and Whedon later patched things up and now say they would gladly work together again.
8. After playing a “bitchy” character on Aaron Spelling's short-lived Malibu Shores (which Carpenter was one of the stand-outs in), Charisma Carpenter was initially reluctant to take the part of Cordelia. They felt they would be typecast. However, their agent bluntly informed them that you can't be typecast if no one knows who you are, so they took the part. This made them one of the oldest actors ever to play a teenager, as they were 27 when the show first aired. The only older members of the young cast were David Boreanaz and James Marsters, which is fine because they were playing the undead. Marsters turned 50 last year.
9. Despite sporting a fairly flawless British accent, James Marsters is not actually British. He's from California. When they auditioned for the role of Spike, Marsters did so with a Texas drawl, but the producers felt a London accent would be more appropriate for the character. Anthony Stewart Head served as Marsters' dialect coach to get the accent right, as Spike's dialect is closer to Head's natural speaking voice than Giles more formal English accent. (Side note: Hearing Marsters speak in their actual voice is weird.)
10. By playing the role of Dawn — the show's most universally disliked character — Michelle Trachtenberg started a tradition of playing characters viewers loathed. Trachtenberg would go onto play Georgina Sparks on Gossip Girl, a character I kind of like, even though every other loyal GG watcher hated them with the fire of a thousand suns. People also apparently hated Trachtenberg on Weeds, but as that was late-period Weeds (which wasn't great then anyway), I chalk that one up to bad timing.
11. The characters of Dawn and Joyce were considerably altered from their original conceptions, which is that they weren't supposed to exist. Originally, Joss Whedon didn't want audiences ever to see Buffy's family but realized that might be a stretch for viewers—because of the outlandish trouble Buffy gets themselves into. Instead, they decided to make Joyce a single parent and give them a recurring role in the series. When Dawn was originally brought into the show, they were supposed to be able to speak to the dead and be telekinetic. Those were thrown out, presumably to enhance their powers of being incredibly annoying.
12. Like female-centric shows Sex and the City, Gilmore Girls and The L Word, the fashions of the series get noticeably more stylish as the series goes along. Usually this is the doing of the network, who wants to make the show more appealing and chic to viewers, but in the case of Buffy, the wardrobe upgrade came at the behest of Sarah Michelle Gellar. After the first season, Gellar allegedly demanded to wear more designer labels — to appeal to their burgeoning “It Girl” status.
13. Gellar hated when fans referred to them as “Buffy,” afraid they would be pigeonholed as Buffy Summers forever. (Which pretty much happened.) Despite that, Gellar says that they were always respectful of the show's fanbase and hoped they would be a role model to young women. They often kept out of the public eye, especially when partying, so Buffy “wouldn't be seen with a drink in their hand.”
14. Before appearing in Buffy, Alyson Hannigan got their start on television in the show Free Spirit — in which they also played a witch. Before that, they starred in the movie My Stepmother is an Alien, a role in which they also dated Seth Green. After Buffy the Vampire Slayer wrapped, Hannigan later appeared in How I Met Your Mother with Neil Patrick Harris. This is interesting because in one episode, Willow mentions that they wrote Doogie Howser fanfic as a youngster. If that's not enough Hannigan for you, Hannigan is also related to Marilyn Manson's drummer.
15. The show's producers were often worried that Nicholas Brendon was getting too fit to play Xander, who was supposed to be a riff on the nerdy sidekick, and advised them to stop working out. (This is weird, because the role was initially offered to Ryan Reynolds, who is the opposite of nerdy.) On set, the cast and crew called them “Nicky,” befitting the Xander character's lovable goofiness. This became a problem when Miss Calendar began their run on the show, as their original first name was “Nicki.” Because that was confusing, they switched their name to Jenny.
16. The actor who plays Jenny Calendar is Robia LaMorte. Them last name means “death” in Portuguese, an unfortunate coincidence considering their character's fate. Although LaMorte is most popularly known for their role in Buffy, they got their start as a dancer and music video girl. After appearing in a Debbie Gibson video, Prince pursued them to be Pearl on the cover of their album Diamonds and Pearls. La Morte then got to travel all over the world with Prince. Not bad for an unassuming high school teacher from Sunnydale.
17. Eliza Dushku (whose last name is pronounced “push-koo”) comes from Mormon folk, which was a conflict of interest while filming controversial sexual material on Buffy. Them grandmother called to complain. For probably non-Mormon reasons, Dushku refused to do nude scenes, until their role in 2008's The Alphabet Killer. However, they have been dating Rick Fox since 2009, who I imagine they do nude scenes for.
18. On the set of Angel and Buffy, David Boreanaz had a habit of pulling down their pants between takes, to see if the other actors in the scene could keep a straight face and not break character. Boreanaz also tended to improvise their lines, especially during Angel, and actors often commented that they had no idea what they would say next. (In a good way.) After Angel wrapped, Boreanaz was actually offered the part of Bruce Wayne in Christopher Nolan's Batman reboot, based on their dark yet witty take on Angel. They turned it down. They also turned down a part in the Resident Evil series and almost declined the role of Seeley in Bones. Do with that information what you will.
19. Because the Buffy masterminds were very into the ideas of duality and dopplegangers, Spike and Angel's birth names are shown in flashback to be Liam and William. Liam is the Irish equivalent of William.
20. Most of the first season of the show was already shot and in the can before the pilot ever aired, which allowed Whedon to reshoot necessary scenes to tweak them. When Buffy Summers tells viewers, “It was my first day…”, this was actually their last day of filming at the fictional Sunnydale High School. This location was the same one that 90210 used for West Beverly Hills High School, and U.C. Sunnydale was actually Santa Cruz.
21. Buffy Summers has three different birthdays throughout the show's run. Although the show celebrated Buffy's birthday around January 19 every year (on an episode around that date), their student records claim otherwise. The first time their records appear Buffy was born on October 24, 1980. Buffy is a sophomore. Later they will be born on May 6, 1979 and be a senior.
22. After Joss Whedon's Firefly was unceremoniously cancelled (#dontgetmestarted), Whedon migrated Firefly regulars over to their other shows. Nathan Fillion became Caleb on Buffy and Gina Torres and Adam Baldwin moved over to Angel. (Firefly's Alan Tudyk later appeared in Dollhouse, which was also cancelled before its time.) Although Whedon initially felt that maneuver might seem “incestuous and weird,” their actors assured them that no one watched Firefly so no one would notice. Call it one of the perks of having Fox totally bungle your show.
23. Dolly Parton was (technically) an executive producer of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Sandy Gallin, who was one of the executive producers of Buffy and Angel, managed Parton's career and held a long-standing production partnership with them Interestingly, this also makes Dolly an unofficial producer of the Andrew Dice Clay special “The Diceman Cometh,” Fly Away Home, the Steve Martin version of Father of the Bride and Noah Baumbach's directorial debut Kicking and Screaming.
24. Series creator and geek overlord Joss Whedon initially got their start writing for shows like Roseanne and Parenthood, the first TV adaptation of the beloved film, which starred Leonardo DiCaprio, Thora Birch and David Arquette, who later appeared in the Buffy movie. As further proof that Whedon gets around, Roseanne would feature during its run Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tim Curry, Stephen Dorff, George Clooney and Alyson Hannigan and also gave TV demi-gods Judd Apatow, Daniel Palladino and Amy Sherman-Palladino their starts. I think that makes Buffy the weird cousin to Family Guy, Gilmore Girls and Freaks and Geeks.
25. Proving that the Emmys kind of suck, Buffy the Vampire Slayer was never up for an award in any of the major categories (despite a consolatory writing nod in 2000). Like other WB shows (namely Gilmore Girls and Felicity), the show was routinely snubbed, although all were recognized by the Golden Globes. (Felicity's Keri Russell even won.) If it makes Joss Whedon feel better, Buffy joins the ranks of The Wire, Freaks and Geeks, Oz, Battlestar Galactica, Sports Night, Community, Party Down and Veronica Mars of great critically-acclaimed shows that never got the Emmy love they deserved. They also have that Avengers money, so I think Joss is doing just fine.
(CNN) -- The longest railway tunnel in the world was completed on Friday in Switzerland when the last two meters of rock were drilled through.
After 14 years of construction the 57 km (34 miles) of the Gotthard Base Tunnel in the Swiss Alps was finally completed when a giant drilling machine nicknamed Sissi cut through the last slice of rock to connect both ends.
After the final breakthrough, 50 miners carrying flags representing the regions of Switzerland involved in the construction walked through the opening, Rahel Probst of AlpTransit Gotthard, told CNN.
"It all went very well, the drilling machine went through the rock and the tunnel was there," said Probst.
The tunnel is just over 3 km longer than the Seikan rail tunnel in Japan, which at 53.9 km had previously been the longest rail tunnel in the world.
Completion of the Gotthard Base Tunnel will cut the travel time between Zurich and Milan in Italy by 60 minutes to two-and-a-half hours and provide an easier and more economic route for heavy freight trains.
The tunnel -- which is in fact composed of two single-track tunnels -- cost $10.6 billion (£6.6 billion).
Since the first preparations for the tunnel were laid in 1996, over 2,500 workers have taken part in its building according to AlpTransit Gotthard, the company constructing the tunnel. It is due to be operational by the end of 2017.
Freight traffic in the entire Alpine region will grow by as much as 75 percent by 2010, according to a study by the EU Commission.
And according to AlpTransit Gotthard, the flatter route of the rail link "will allow fast, economical freight transportation."
"Only by upgrading its railway infrastructure can Switzerland meet the rising demand for freight transportation and the increasing needs of customers," according to an AlpTransit Gotthard statement.

Washington (CNN) - As the war in Afghanistan passes the ten-year mark, a new national survey indicates that support for the conflict has dropped to an all-time low as a growing number of Americans express concern that the situation in the central Asian country has turned into another Vietnam.
According to a CNN/ORC International Poll released Friday, only 34% of the public says they support the war in Afghanistan, one point less than the previous low of 35%, with 63% opposed to the conflict.
Full results (pdf)
"But that opposition is not a reflection of the original decision to get involved in Afghanistan a decade ago," says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "It's what Afghanistan has turned into in the subsequent decade that has soured Americans on the war effort there."
The survey indicates that 57% say it was not a mistake to send military forces to Afghanistan in October 2001, several weeks after the September 11th terrorist attacks.
But according to the poll, 58% now say that the war in Afghanistan has turned into a situation like the U.S. faced in Vietnam, six points higher than the number who felt that way a year ago.
The survey also indicates partisan and gender gaps over the conflict.
"The war in Afghanistan is perhaps the one remaining policy on which President Obama and Republicans agree," says Holland. "Six in ten Republicans still support the war, compared to only a quarter of Democrats and independents. Support is also much higher among men than women, although a majority of both groups oppose the war."
The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International from Oct. 14-16, with 1,007 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.

A Lexington man faces numerous charges following a Saturday morning standoff with the Lexington Police Department.
According to a press release provided Saturday by LPD, officers attempted to stop Josh Bocanegra, 31, of 282 Curtis Leonard Road, as part of an ongoing domestic violence investigation. During this investigation it was reported that Bocanegra was in possession of firearm while violating a domestic violence order. According to an arrest warrant Bocanegra allegedly entered the residence of their wife while in possession of a revolver handgun.
Bocanegra is also facing multiple misdemeanor and traffic charges after refusing to exit their vehicle during a traffic stop. According to the press release, Bocanegra failed to stop their vehicle, a white Dodge truck, and officers began a vehicle pursuit. The pursuit ended in the middle of Hamilton Road. After that, the Bocanegra refused to exit the vehicle and waved what they claimed to be a firearm, the press release stated.
Bocanegra allegedly threatened officers with the N.C. Highway Patrol, Lexington Police Department and Davidson County Sheriff's Office, by screaming that "he had a gun for them and that they would shoot them," according to a magistrate's order. Bocanegra was charged with misdemeanor communicating threats and misdemeanor resisting a public officer as a result of the offenses.
Bocanegra also allegedly drove their truck toward a Lexington police officer during the incident and was ticketed with felony flee or elude law enforcement, reckless driving and misdemeanor attempted assault with a deadly weapon. Bocanegra was also ticketed with driving with a revoked license, failure to stop at a stop sign and speeding.
Officers secured the surrounding area and encouraged surrounding residents to stay in their homes or voluntarily evacuate the area, according to the press release. No one was harmed during the confrontation or in the domestic violence incident prior to the standoff, the release said. Officials were able to take them into custody around 2:20 a.m.
Bocanegra was given no bond for the domestic violation and a $50,000 secured bond for the other offenses.  They are scheduled to appear in court Feb. 14 on the domestic offenses and Feb. 20 on the other charges.
California demographic shift: More people leaving than moving in
More people are moving out of the state than are moving in. It's the economy, of course, especially housing costs.
Recent census figures show the state is losing more Californians like McCluer than it is attracting from other parts of the U.S. And the trend toward out-migration is looking less like a blip than a long-term condition.
McCluer would like to move back, but it's still too expensive. "It's really difficult," McCluer said. "I've given myself 11/2 to two years to save money."
Unable to afford Orange County's sky-high rents, they opted for Portland, Ore. "A big motivator was that I lived with roommate after roommate," said McCluer, 30. "Friends said you could probably live on your own up here. The rent was a huge deal for me."
For a clue to why California is losing its allure as a place to settle down, just ask Jennifer McCluer, who moved out of California in 2007 after they obtained their license in skin care.
The proportion of Californians who had moved here from out of state reached a 100-year low of about 20% in 2010, and the decade measured by the most recent census was the first in a century in which the majority of Californians were native-born.
The demographics of California today more closely resemble those of 1900 than of 1950: It is a mostly home-grown population, whose future depends on the children of immigrants and their children, said William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
"We used to say California, here we come," said Frey. "That now has flipped."
Experts point to various causes of the turnaround, most of them rooted in a flagging economy. But exorbitant housing prices — too high for many struggling Californians despite a burst housing bubble — still play a role.
"There's a lot of concern about driving out working-class families," said Hans Johnson of the Public Policy Institute of California.
It was a different world in the 1950s and '60s, when roughly half of Californians were drawn from other states by jobs and by visions of crystalline blue skies in January and beach parties in September. The state's shining image was burnished by a public relations machine that pushed attractive suburban real estate and a wide-open field for business.
As domestic immigration slowed between 1970 and 2000, foreign immigration filled in the gap. But since 2000, even the state's once-growing immigrant population has been frozen at 27% of total residents. Since at least 2005, more residents have left California than arrived here from other states.
The outflow, driven by high housing prices before the bubble burst, slowed as the recession brought prices down, then ticked back up in 2010 as the job picture remained dim, census data show.
And there is no sign of the old luster returning. Migration all over the United States has slowed to a crawl in this recession, and the exodus from Mexico is diminishing because of border violence and U.S. job shortages. That means the state increasingly will have to rely on the people it produces to power the economy.
Some analysts see a dark future in the loss of the demographic dynamism that has been the state's hallmark.
"A steady-state California is both a contradiction in terms and a recipe for decline," said historian and author Mike Davis, who teaches writing at UC Riverside.
Davis said warehousing and other commerce in inland California produces relatively few jobs, while employment in Los Angeles County is increasingly concentrated in small, poorly capitalized service businesses that could collapse in a recession.
"This is a totally different world from the days when the aerospace industry was the big engine," Davis said.
Kellyanne Conway, White House counselor and President Trump's former campaign manager, keeps giving televised interviews that dominate the news cycle – sometimes due to misconstrued facts, or falsehoods. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)
Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, would have you believe that there is another President Trump who goes unrecognized by the world: a Donald Trump who, yes, tweets, but who also is the driving force behind the sanitized statements the White House releases, who advocates for complex policy in partnership with Capitol Hill Republicans and who writes the speeches they occasionally read at events.
What's more, Conway seemed to suggest in an interview on NBC's “Today” show Monday morning, that Other Trump, the presidential one, gets short shrift in favor of the guy who's constantly railing in 140-character sound bites on Twitter.
“This obsession with covering everything they say on Twitter and very little what they do as president …” Conway said during that interview.
“That's their preferred method of communication with the American people,” said Craig Melvin, the show's co-host.
“That's not true,” Conway interjected.
“Well, they haven't given an interview in three weeks, so lately it has been their preferred method,” Melvin replied.
Even setting aside that three-week modification, Melvin is correct that the administration has touted Twitter as being more important than media coverage. After Trump won the presidency in November, they and their team were asked if they would stop tweeting so much as president. The answer? No — because the media can't be trusted.
Shortly after the election, Trump spoke with CBS's Leslie Stahl, telling them how they planned to moderate their Twitter use once they were sworn in.
“I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to do very restrained,” they said. “I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's — it's where it's at.”
By January, their description of their Twitter habit was a bit less enthusiastic.
“Look, I don't like tweeting. I have other things I could be doing. But I get very dishonest media, very dishonest press. And it's my only way that I can counteract,” Trump told Reuters in January. That's the theme: The media is the enemy, so Trump will tweet to the people directly.
On ABC's “This Week” in January, incoming press secretary Sean Spicer made that same case.
“With all due respect, I think it freaks the mainstream media out that they have this following of over 45-plus-million people that follow them on social media that they can have a direct conversation with,” Spicer said.
“The fact of the matter is that when they tweet, they get results,” they added.
Given that Trump and their team have explicitly presented Twitter as their trusted outlet for communicating with their base, perhaps Conway is splitting the hair more finely: Their tweets are reluctant, because they don't get the press that they want and that they think they deserve.
But, then, that undercuts their point about how Trump's tweets shouldn't be covered. If they're an important workaround because of an unfair press, then it doesn't make sense that the White House wouldn't want the media to present them to the public. If it's good that their tweets go directly to millions on Twitter, why is it bad if they go to millions more on television?
So what is Conway up to? They recognize that Trump's tweets are not actually beneficial.
Poll after poll shows that even Trump voters wish he'd stop using Twitter in the same way. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) made a similar case in a local TV interview last week, saying that Trump has “created problems for himself” with their use of Twitter.
That Trump's tweets keep getting them into trouble both makes them more newsworthy and serves as a reminder that they should not be treated as simple social-media flotsam now that he's president. Over the weekend, a Twitter bot launched that reformats their tweets to look like official White House statements, highlighting that, on Twitter or not, these are the words of the president of the United States.
A statement by the President: pic.twitter.com/fJTemIxD2P — Real Press Sec. (@RealPressSecBot) June 5, 2017
What Conway wants isn't really for the media to dig into Trump's efforts in office, especially given that those efforts are fairly modest in scope. (Remember when Trump played down the importance of the 100-day mark of their presidency as it became clear that they wouldn't have much to tout?) What Conway wants, instead, is for the nation to believe that Trump's tweets are just light fluff, dinner-party conversation from a president whose rigorous workweeks are meanwhile getting short shrift.
Conway wants us to believe that the Twitter Trump is not the real president. That it's the big Wizard of Oz surrounded by flames and smoke who's the real deal, not the guy tapping on their iPhone behind the curtain. That's a tough sell, because nearly every other indicator suggests that the sober, typical president that the White House tries to put forward is the one that doesn't really exist meaningfully in substance.
This post assumes that you at least have some working knowledge of Angular, Jasmine, and @ngrx/effects.
If you have no prior knowledge on the subject, you can read my previous articles and then come back.
Let's start with a simple example that we can test. We'll create a basic redux flow that will fetch blog posts from the server.
Build the Posts Reducer —
Build the Posts Action Creators —
Now let's create the service that will be responsible for fetching the posts from the server.
Build the Posts Service —
Build the Posts Effects —
We need to listen to GET_POSTS action, then call our service and based on the response status to do the following thing:
If the response is successful, dispatch GET_POSTS_SUCCESS action with the result.
action with the result. If the request fails, dispatch GET_POSTS_FAIL action with the error.
These are the two cases we need to test
Let's create the test and explain each part.
TestBed creates an Angular testing module — an @NgModule class—that you configure with the configureTestingModule method to produce the module environment for the class you want to test.
The configureTestingModule method takes an @NgModule -like metadata object. The metadata object can have most of the properties of a normal Angular module.
We need to import the EffectsTestingModule from @ngrx/effects . We also need two providers:
The original PostsEffects . A mock of our PostsService.get() method.
One of the reasons we want to mock the service get() method is because we do not want to make an HTTP request. In addition to that, In this case, we do not care about the method implementation; we care about the result.
Let's stop for a second to explain this piece.
jasmine.createSpyObj is used to create a mock that will spy on one or more methods. It returns an object that has a property for each string that is a spy.
What we are saying here is, Hey Angular when you need the PostsService , please provide this mock.
Next, we can get a reference to the providers with the help of the TestBed.get(provider) method.
EffectsRunner is provided by the EffectsTestingModule .
Now we can write our first case.
postsService.get() is a jasmine spy, therefore we can control the return value. In this case, we are returning mock data.
Next, we are calling the queue() method that their job is to queue up actions.
The last thing we need to do is to subscribe to the postEffects.get$ observable and check if the result is the same as our mock data.
Now, let's test the second part.
The same process as before, smooth and clean.
One of the top New York State administration officials terrified a contingent of foreign leaders last year when, in a state presentation in which they used a laser pointer attached to a handgun, they pointed the weapon at the crowd, according to a new report.
Jerome Hauer, Governor Andrew Cuomo's commissioner of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services for the state of New York, was delivering a slideshow presentation about the state's preparedness for Hurricane sandy on October 24, 2012. Hauer was speaking at the highly secure state emergency operations center in Albany.
Hauer was using the laser aim on their gun to point emphasize sections of the slides. At one point, according to eyewitnesses who spoke to the Albany Times Union, the laser pointer crossed over three Swedish managers seated in the crowd, the small dot terrifying them as it made its way to the presentation slides.
The commissioner suffered a stroke in the years prior to the two-hour meeting in question and can at times appear unsteady. Yet they are not a police officer or any other kind of law enforcement official, and carrying a loaded 9-millimeter Glock into state buildings appears to be a violation of New York law.
The Times Union noted that the emergency managers “were rattled when the gun's laser tracked across one of their heads before Hauer found the map of New York, at which they wanted to point” and that at least two people “moved quickly out of the line of the laser when they brought out the gun.”
Questioned by reporters, Hauer said only that they “have bad sources.” Peter Cutler, Hauer's communications officer, said only “I've heard rumors” and that they would investigate the claims further in the future.
“Your guess [as to what happened] is as good as mine,” Cutler said. “I don't have any information on that. I don't even know if they carry a weapon.”
It is well-known throughout the capital that not only does Hauer carry a weapon but employs guards and personal staff who are usually armed as well, according to the paper.
Hauer, an expert on bioterrorism security, is currently paid $136,000 annually in their position and previously served as director of the New York City Office of Emergency Management under New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  They are reportedly under consideration for a liaison position between the Cuomo administration and the government of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Heatherwick's London buses to be phased out for “greener” alternative A spokesperson for Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says that the “vanity” buses will no longer be produced and “greener” public transport alternatives will be prioritised.
Image by James O Jenkins for TfL
Transport for London (TfL) has confirmed it will be phasing out Thomas Heatherwick's Routemaster buses, and will instead be investing in “greener” alternatives.
The New Routemaster – also known as the Boris Bus – first started being used on London streets in February 2012, brought in under Boris Johnson's tenure as Mayor of London.
Its distinguishing feature is its “hop-on hop-off” open platform at the back of the bus, which was introduced to allow greater accessibility for passengers.
The double-decker hybrid diesel and electric bus has three doors in total, and two staircases, one at the front and one at the back.
Current Mayor of London Sadiq Khan confirmed that they would not be buying any more Routemaster buses, saying that “Londoners deserve a bus fleet that is greener, more affordable and more functional”.
A spokesperson for Khan says that TfL is swapping investment in Routemaster “vanity” buses for a new generation of ultra-low and zero-emission buses to help “clean up London's toxic air”.
There will be a transition to hydrogen and electric-powered buses, including a trial of a new hydrogen double-decker bus which is set to hit London's roads next year.
The bus will be manufactured by Wrightbus, the same company which manufactured Heatherwick's Routemaster.
The Routemaster bus previously received criticism for alleged design faults such as overheating in the summer and producing more pollution than was claimed it would.
The cost also fell under scrutiny, with some questioning whether London “could afford” the buses, which initially required a conductor to man the back door and which individually cost more than £300,000 to produce, according to The Guardian.
In 2015, Transport for London announced it would be changing the back door of the bus, meaning that it could no longer be kept open during stops, indicating that its distinguishing “hop-on hop-off” design function was being phased out.
A spokesperson at Heatherwick Studio says: “There's been no cancellation of orders of Routemasters. 600 were originally ordered and manufactured, then this was extended to 1000. This was the maximum number that was ever going to be made during Boris Johnson's tenure.”
“We still feel that the bus has been a massive success in design. It's been all around the world promoting British manufacturing and has changed the way people feel about riding buses over the last five years. It's been the most-widely used bus in the city of London.”
At the time of publishing, manufacturer Wrightbus has not confirmed what buses will be produced to replace the Routemaster.
It's not often I stumble across something I've never seen before, but rub your eyes and take a look at this – a 1989 Volkswagen LT45 double cab 4×4 expedition outlander. Now that's a mouthful. Think of it like a Unimog for hippies or a 4×4 VW bus with room for friends. Imported from “somewhere in Europe” per the seller, this diesel-powered Volkswagen has traveled 90,000 miles down foreign dirt roads only to land in Saint Petersburg, Florida. With roof racks, a snorkel and bunk beds, it sure seems like a worthy expedition vehicle if you're not in a hurry to get anywhere. Slap a peace symbol on the front and invite your hippie friends over to smoke dope in the back while the onboard Onan generator powers your beer fridge. Bidding has been steady and ample time remains to quit your job and slowly trek North America in your new VW double cab 4×4 where bidding currently sits protected by a reserve at just over $5,500. Peace, man.

Ohio tea partiers will finally get their big moment at the ballot box on November 8. That's when Ohioans vote on Issue 3, a referendum spearheaded by tea party groups that would amend the state constitution to ban any law or rule requiring that citizens buy health insurance. The intent is obvious: to rebuke President Obama by blocking the individual mandate—the part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that requires Americans to buy health insurance or pay a fine. Issue 3 was also seen as a way to fire up conservative voters in an off-year election when the fate of Gov. John Kasich's anti-union SB 5 bill is on the line.
But the measure backfired. Not only won't it block the ACA's individual mandate, but it's so vague, legal experts say, that it could have the damaging, unintended effect of undermining key public services and regulations in Ohio, including blocking the state's ability to collect crucial data on infectious diseases. If passed, it could also spark a wave of costly lawsuits, with taxpayers likely footing the bill. “It's extremely sloppy and extremely overbroad,” says Jessie Hill, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law. “I hesitate to say whether these potentially extremely troubling consequences were intended or whether the amendment was just misguided.” And if you trust the polls, Issue 3 isn't even energizing Ohio conservatives.
Issue 3 is the brainchild of the Ohio Liberty Council, a coalition of tea party chapters, 912 groups, and other liberty-loving activists. The Council tried to put Issue 3—which it calls the “Healthcare Freedom Amendment”—on the ballot in November 2010, but fell short in the signature-gathering process. This year, the group redoubled its efforts and managed to gather nearly 427,000 signatures, enough to put the issue before voters. (The Liberty Council did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)
The amendment, endorsed by Ohio Right to Life and Republican state Sen. Bob Peterson, was pitched as a direct response to Obama's Affordable Care Act. An early pamphlet (PDF) created by the Ohio Project, the grassroots group created to promote the amendment, focuses entirely on defusing “the new federal health care measure passed by Congress.”
But if Issue 3 passes, it won't affect the Affordable Care Act. Richard Saphire, a professor at the University of Dayton Law School, says passage of Issue 3 might deliver a symbolic rejection of the individual mandate, but legally it would have zero effect, because Article VI of the US Constitution says that federal law trumps state law. “It's very defective,” they say. “Folks that come out and vote for it, probably most of them are going to think they're going to accomplish something that they're not going to accomplish, which is prevented federal law from going into effect.”
Issue 3 supporters now concede this. But they insist the measure will still prevent a Massachusetts-style, state-based individual mandate from becoming law in Ohio and will set the stage for individual Ohioans to challenge the Affordable Care Act in court. Ohioans could say “you are fundamentally restricting our liberty and property here, and there was no due process,” Chris Littleton, a cofounder of the Ohio Liberty Council, said at an Issue 3 debate in late October.
While Issue 3 won't derail “Obamacare,” it would have potentially “massive and disastrous impacts” on health care delivery and public health regulation in Ohio, says Case Western's Hill.
A report (PDF) cowritten by Hill and released by Innovation Ohio, a liberal public policy group that opposes Issue 3, found that the amendment's overbroad language could undermine a slew of programs that include some form of mandate. The amendment reads, in part:
No federal, state, or local law or rule shall compel, directly or indirectly, any person, employer, or health care provider to participate in a health care system.
Although the amendment would exempt laws in place before 2010, any new reforms to, say, workers' compensation, which requires employers to buy insurance in case of workplace injuries, would violate the measure. State law also requires that public schools pay to immunize students whose families can't afford it; reforms of that program would be blocked under Issue 3 because the immunization requirement is a type of mandate, according to the Innovation Ohio report. The amendment, the report noted, would likely render unconstitutional a key reporting element in a state law to regulate so-called pill mills, because it compels “participation” in a “health care system.” And Issue 3 would handcuff the state's ability to gather data on infectious diseases including HIV and influenza for the same reason.
Hill and Saphire both say Issue 3's passage would likely set off a wave of litigation aimed at discovering the true meaning and reach of the amendment. And it would be Ohioans, Hill says, footing the bill for those lawsuits.
Issue 3 isn't getting much love from Ohio opinion makers, liberal or conservative. Despite its opposition to the “deeply flawed” Affordable Care Act, the conservative editorial board of the Columbus Dispatch, the state's largest newspaper, urged a “no” vote on the measure. Arguing that state constitutions should not be subject to “short-term political gamesmanship,” the Dispatch wrote that “trying to counter the federal law with an ineffective amendment to the Ohio Constitution is a bad idea. This is not where that battle should be fought.” Every major newspaper editorial board in Ohio that's taken a position on Issue 3 has opposed it.
If recent polls are any judge, Issue 3 hasn't done much to mobilize conservative voters, either. An October 28 survey by the University of Akron Bliss Institute of Applied Politics found that 34 percent of respondents favor Issue 3 and 18 percent oppose it. The remaining 48 percent remained undecided less than two weeks before the vote. More importantly, the Akron survey found much more enthusiasm around Issue 2—which polls suggest will be defeated, repealing Kasich's SB 5 bill—than around Issue 3, which polls suggest will pass.
If Issue 3 becomes law, it wouldn't be the first time voters approved an amendment to a state constitution that didn't serve its intended purpose, Saphire says. After the US Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, a handful of states passed symbolic amendments expressing opposition to the Brown decision. The Supreme Court is expected to decide the fate of the ACA's individual mandate in its upcoming term. If the high court decides to uphold the law, Ohio tea partiers—Issue 3 or no—will have to buy health insurance or pay a fine.

The shots were coming at us as the car was coming at us. I didn't know if they were armed or not.” One of the officers says to another officer during the shooting
It seems the picture of Paul O'Neal being a total criminal, drawn by the police now proves untrue. The results of toxicology tests revealed that O'Neal didn't have any drugs in their system at the time of their death. The police officers claimed that they were armed during the chase, which also proved to be false because authorities have confirmed that O'Neal was not in possession of a gun.
The incident occurred on July 28 this year when officers responded to a report of a stolen Jaguar. A 10-min video footage released one week after the shooting shows the procedural errors that were made by the three officers involved. The cop who shot O'Neal had their camera turned off during the shooting and it is not clear what exactly happened during the shooting itself but they claimed that O'Neal was shot in the chest. However, the autopsy says that the victim was shot in the back. After the incident, the camera was mysteriously turned on again, which also leaves us thinking that the cops were hiding something.
The agency refused to release the names of the responding officers. They cited a specific clause which allows them to withhold the information if the details “endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel or any other person.” That means we are not likely to see any justice for Paul O'Neal. However, their family filed a wrongful death suit against the city.
It is hard to see how desperately police officers were trying to cover up their story to stay innocent. Are they playing a game which aims to kill as many Black teens as possible? Justice must be served and those cops have to be punished for their deeds.

Product Description
It is 1882, and the Old Ones are already here.
They arrived seven hundred years ago and have been ruling the planet ever since. The majority of people just get on with their lives, accepting their monstrous rulers. However, there is a growing band of revolutionaries who wish to free humankind from their slavery. These freedom fighters call themselves the Restorationists. A secret war has already broken out between the Restorationists and the forces loyal to the Old Ones. The invention of dynamite has changed the balance of power, and a lone assassin now has the capacity to destroy an Old One. In this shadow world of assassins, informers, police agents and anarchists, nobody is quite sure who is who and which side they fight for.
The game A Study in Emerald draws its central plot from the award-winning short story penned by Neil Gaiman, in which the worlds of Sherlock Holmes and H.P. Lovecraft are combined to telling effect. However, to create a world detailed enough for players, much has been added from real history. The nineteenth century was a time of unrest, with many colorful characters fighting both for and against the authorities.
A Study in Emerald is the outcome of the merging of these three worlds.

Dele Alli scored their 14th goal of the season against Fleetwood, their first since 17 February
MK Dons kept up their hopes of securing automatic promotion from League One after a 3-0 victory over Fleetwood.
After a goalless first-half, the Dons took the lead against the run of play as Lewis Baker tapped in as Dele Alli delivered a low cross to the near post.
As Fleetwood searched for an equaliser, Will Grigg latched on to a long ball and scored with a drilled low shot.
Alli's stunning 20-yard half-volley two minutes later saw MK Dons move within three points of Preston in second.
The loss for the Cod Army dented their hopes of reaching the play-offs, with the defeat leaving them eight points behind Chesterfield with three matches remaining.

MK Dons boss Karl Robinson told 3CR: "Fleetwood is a very good side...so we knew how difficult it was going to be.
"We knew we had to be at our best to get something out of the game.
On Dele Alli "The boy's got tremendous potential. He's been fighting to try and find their form since he's come back. We saw in that final 45 minutes he's back to their best. He's the best player in the league.
"The players have performed and won 3-0. I can't ask anything more than that."
Earlier this year, Rio Ferdinand famously missed out being selected for Euro 2012 due to “football reasons”. It created quite a stir as their omission was suspected to have had something to do with John Terry and their racial row with their brother Anton Ferdinand.
But with Terry retiring suddenly last week, rumours have resurfaced about Ferdinand returning to the national team, so much that it made Roy Hodgson regrettably announced that Ferdinand's international career is as good as over.
[quote]I have to say it is over for them and England. It has got to be the end of the road.  They are pushing 34 and hasn't played for England for a long, long time.
Roy Hodgson[/quote]
How true is that? Is Rio Ferdinand really not good enough for the England team anymore?
To try and prove this statement, let us look at the statistics from the other central defenders that have been called up to the England squad and see whether they are more deserving of a place than Rio is.
Using statistical comparison from Opta Stats, I will compare Ferdinand's overall performances so far this season to Stoke City's Ryan Shawcross, Manchester City's Joleon Lescott, Everton's Phil Jagielka and Chelsea's Gary Cahill.
Overview
While it has only been 6 games into the season, only Shawcross and Jagielka have played in all 6 games for their teams. Ferdinand, Lescott and Cahill have 4 appearances each. Ferdinand has conceded the most goals amongst all of them, with 1.5 goals conceded per game. While this can be an unfair reflection of the player because the entire team, defence and goalkeeper should be responsible for a goal being conceded, they cannot be entirely absolved from their defensive responsibilities as well.
It should also be pointed out that Cahill has played only 279 minutes so far in the Premier League this season, almost half of what Shawcross and Jagielka has played, and 80 minutes (almost the duration of an entire game) less than Ferdinand. Evidently, how much time each player gets on the pitch is seemingly not a main criterion for getting into the England squad (as of now, at least).
Defending
In terms of defending, at first glance, Shawcross seems the dominant player here, surpassing the other players in the quantity of tackles and challenges made. They have made 29 ground 50-50 challenges, 32 aerial 50-50 challenges and 16 tackles, way more than any other player shown in the table. This is probably a numerical insight into Shawcross' impressive performances so far this season.
However, in terms of quality, Shawcross pales in comparison to Ferdinand. Ferdinand has won 94% of their 16 ground 50-50s compared to Shawcross' 69%, they won 82% of their 11 aerial 50-50 challenges compared to Shawcross' 66% and has a tackle success rate of 81.82%, compared to Shawcross' 68.75%. Ferdinand has also made more interceptions than Shawcross in a shorter time period (Ferdinand has 11 successful tackles in 359 minutes, while Shawcross has 10 successful tackles in 540 minutes). In fact, Ferdinand has the best ground 50-50, aerial 50-50, tackling and interception statistics amongst the 4 other central defenders.
The inference here would be that Ferdinand is the most competent at defending as compared to those that had been picked for the national squad over him. If the criteria were based purely on defensive ability, wouldn't Ferdinand have already been picked for the England team?
Passing
From Table 3, we can see that Ferdinand and Lescott are far superior in their passing as compared to the Shawcross, Jagielka and Cahill. Not only do they have the highest number of total accurate passes (Ferdinand made 215 accurate passes while Lescott made 222 accurate passes), their percentage of pass completion (Ferdinand has 92.67% pass completion rate and Lescott has 92.12% pass completion rate) is the highest as well. This can be rationalized from the way their teams play. Manchester United and Manchester City, being the more superior teams, they usually dominate games and keep possession better, so naturally the defenders from these teams like Ferdinand and Lescott would have a higher than average passing rate.
We should note that Shawcross, despite playing the most number of minutes, has the least number of passes (only 82 passes) and the lowest pass completion rate (only 68.33% pass completion rate). While some might say that their quality is less superior to the others, we should take into account Stoke City's more direct style of play, where balls are being thrown forward more regularly than other teams. This can be proven in the table, as we see that Shawcross' open play pass forwards is a whopping 73%, far greater that the other players. This could explain their misleadingly lower pass completion rate.
Nevertheless, this table has shown Ferdinand to be in equal stead, if not better, than the other players who were selected ahead of him.
Goal Attempts
While defenders are not usually renowned for their attacking prowess, it is definitely advantageous and important at times to have a defender who has a knack for scoring the odd-goals, especially in set pieces.
From the table, only Cahill and Lescott have scored so far this season. Cahill scored on their first appearance of the season in the 4-2 win over Reading while Lescott scored in the 1-1 draw against Arsenal. Jagielka scored their first goal for England (a diving header) during a 2-1 friendly victory over Italy in August this year. While Shawcross may not have scored this season, they have scored a few goals in the Premier League over the seasons, so the potential to score an odd goal is definitely there. As for Ferdinand, they have not scored in over 4 seasons in the Premier League, and expecting one from them can be considered a little miracle.
Still, I do believe that as important as scoring goals are, it is not really that significant of a criterion in determining if a defender would get in the England squad.
Conclusion
From the statistics shown, we can see that, by and large, Ferdinand is still on par (and better in some aspects even) with the other players, especially in terms of defending and passing.
Had the decision to pick the central defenders be based solely on the statistics mentioned earlier, it would be a cardinal sin not to have included Ferdinand in the team. Furthermore, with Terry out of the picture, the central defence would not have that wealth of experience that Ferdinand can provide.
However, based on Hodgson's quote regarding Ferdinand, it seems the biggest factors going against them are their age and fitness. At 34, Ferdinand's persistent back problems have been a concern for the past couple of seasons, and they have had the more than occasional muscle strain or pull within the same time period as well. In all honesty, there can be no assurances of their fitness being kept consistent for a prolonged period of time. Hence, that could probably be the main factor that made Hodgson decide not to call them up.
No doubt Rio Ferdinand definitely deserves to be called up to the national squad. But their proneness to injury is probably too much of a risk for Hodgson to want to take. This is coupled with the fact that other players like Shawcross have shown through their performances this season that they at least deserve a shot at playing at center back for England.
[digg-reddit-me][W]hen their Democratic crowds jeer at the mere mention of Senator John McCain, [Obama] offers a gentle scolding, “You don't need to boo, you just need to vote.”
From Jeff Zeleny's New York Times piece today. Contrast this with McCain's and Palin's escalating rhetoric and their seeming embrace of much of the negative attitudes of their crowds. McCain finally had enough and tried to calm some people down as the vehemence and extremism of their crowds became a political issue in and of itself – but you can still see them reveling in the boos at the mention of Obama, The New York Times, or other liberal bogeymen.
One of the essential elements of what makes Obama's politics so compelling is that it is not toxic – as so much political dialogue today is. Their attempt to raise the level of political discourse and to engage in respectful political dialogue has become one of their trademarks – even though their campaign has often failed to live up to this high standard.
Obama has proved that they are willing and able to hit back hard – and to land some low blows. But their focus has always been on the substance – for example, treating Keating Five as a distraction – producing an ad and holding it until McCain started their personal attacks on Obama.
All this reminds me of the story of the pro-life protestors at an Obama rally in New Hampshire the day before the primary election versus Hillary:
…the day before the New Hampshire primary, a group of pro-life protesters interrupted an Obama rally. They refused to stop chanting to allow Mr. Obama to speak, and after a few minutes, they were removed by security. The largely Democratic crowd was clearly on Barack's side in this – booing the protesters, drowning their chants out. But after they left, Mr. Obama gently scolded the crowd: Let me just say this though. Some people got organized to do that. That's part of the American tradition we are proud of. And thats hard too, standing in the midst of people who disagree with you and letting your voice be heard.
Another story of Obama's politically unnecessary grace comes Peggy Noonan wrote last Friday:
When the press was hitting hard on the pregnancy of Sarah Palin's 17-year-old daughter, they did not respond with a politically shrewd “I have no comment,” or “We shouldn't judge.” Instead they said, “My mother had me when they were 18,” which shamed the press and others into silence. They showed grace when they didn't have to.
Let me be clear – Obama is no saint. But there is an uncommon grace about him, especially in contrast to our politics.
It is this grace that is the essence of Obama's particular brand of post-partisanship. It is this grace that deflates the hyped-up fears that people like Fouad Ajami try to foment as they recall how leaders harnassing the power of crowds have brought down Arab societies. What Ajami misses is the relationship Obama has to the crowd – which makes all the difference.

Space is fascinating — astronauts have walked on the moon and people may go explore Mars. But now, it just got even cooler, or ~weirder~, depending on how you look at it. ICYMI, some astronomers think there may be a huge piece of alien technology that aims to get energy from a distant star.
Whaaaaat?
It looks like Tabby's star is dimming over time after all, and yes, it might still be aliens: https://t.co/5aP1B0ujZI — Maddie Stone (@themadstone) August 5, 2016
Images from the star have been studied the past four years via a Kepler Telescope, and a new (yet unpublished) study was posted to arXiv. Not only did the luminosity vary — sometimes going down by even 20 percent — but its total luminosity also went down during the study, by four percent.
“The part that really surprised me was just how rapid and non-linear [the dimming] was,” study author and Caltech astronomer Ben Montet told Gizmodo. “We spent a long time trying to convince ourselves this wasn't real. We just weren't able to.”
But, it's not like Tabby's Star is a new phenomenon. Scientists first saw it in the 19th century. Other researchers, too, have been trying to get to the bottom of the celestial mystery. For instance, Louisiana State University's Bradley Schaefer came out with a study in early 2016.
He, too, found that the star was getting dimmer — by 19 percent in 100 years. However, not everyone agreed with Schaefer's findings.
That brings us back to alien—and the theory that all the dimming and flickering could be because of an “alien superstructure.”
via giphy
Yep, extraterrestrial beings could be amassing energy by building around their star, like a Dyson Sphere.
via giphy
If not an alien structure, then what?
Others believe the debris of a planet could be blocking the star, all the flickering could be due to a quickly spinning and irregularly shaped star, or that it's because of gravity darkening and spin-orbit misalignment.
Like a lot of things in space, it remains a mystery for now. But the evidence just keeps getting weirder and weirder.
(But if the alien in question looks like E.T., that's another story.)

The US has launched two additional air strikes against militants from the Islamic State (IS) group in northern Iraq, the Pentagon has said.
US drones and Navy fighter jets attacked targets near the Kurdish city of Irbil - a similar location to the first strike earlier on Friday.
The Sunni Muslim group IS has taken control of swathes of Iraq and Syria.
Tens of thousands of people from minority groups have fled their homes due to the militants' advance.
IS, formerly known as Isis, has also seized Iraq's largest dam.
These air strikes are the first time the US has been directly involved in a military operation in Iraq since American troops withdrew in late 2011.
The US later also confirmed a second air-drop of supplies to displaced people in the Sinjar area of northern Iraq.
Convoy targeted
In the second wave of air strikes, US drones destroyed a mortar position and killed a group of militants, the Pentagon said.
Analysis by BBC Washington correspondent David Willis
President Barack Obama hasn't set a timetable for the current intervention and White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said simply that the length of the campaign would be determined by events on the ground.
They said that, ultimately, a solution to the current violence rests with the formation of an Iraqi government that is representative of all the Iraqi people. Yet the course of this engagement is difficult to predict.
White House officials concede they are concerned about the Islamic State fighters' proficiency - they are said to be well armed and well trained - hence it remains to be seen whether air strikes will be effective.
All of which raises the prospect of "mission creep" if the current campaign doesn't halt their advance.

Then just over an hour later, F/A-18 jets used laser-guided bombs to hit a seven-vehicle convoy of IS vehicles, spokesperson Rear Admiral John Kirby said.
Earlier on Friday, two 500lb (227kg) bombs were dropped on IS artillery being used against forces defending Irbil, capital of the autonomous Kurdistan Region.

"Then longer term obviously we want to work to provide some time and space for the Kurdish forces to get back on their feet and fight this threat on their own," they said.
"There's not really a long term US military solution here."
IS recently seized towns held by Kurdish "Peshmerga" forces, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee into the mountains.
Although the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Region have been at odds for months, Prime Minister Nouri Maliki sent a plane load of ammunition to Irbil on Friday, Reuters reported.
Mr Maliki has previously ordered the air force to support Kurdish fighters in their fight against IS.
The White House said Vice-President Joe Biden had called Iraqi President Fuad Masum on Friday and reiterated President Obama's commitment to help Iraqi civilians and bolster Iraq's ability to fight IS forces.
Earlier, US Secretary of State John Kerry said the world needed to wake up to the threat posed by the IS group.

They said its "campaign of terror against the innocent, including the Yazidi and Christian minorities" showed "all the warning signs of genocide".
British government sources told the BBC the air strikes were entirely "a US operation" and the UK was currently focused on humanitarian efforts.
While future participation in air strikes had not been ruled out, it had not been discussed by the UK government's emergency committee Cobra on Friday, and would not be over the weekend, the sources said.
Air drops
IS fighters seized Qaraqosh, Iraq's biggest Christian town this week, causing thousands to flee. The militants' advance also forced tens of thousands of Yazidis to escape to mountains near Sinjar.
Late on Thursday, US military planes dropped food and water to help the displaced Yazidis and early on Saturday confirmed a second air-drop.

Iraq's human rights ministry says the militants have seized hundreds of Yazidi women.
Ministry spokesperson Kamil Amin, quoted by AP news agency, said some were being held in schools in Iraq's second largest city Mosul.
Back in June, when Isis took over Mosul, Mr Maliki requested US air strikes to halt the militants' advance - but Washington did not intervene.
Analysts say the relentless advance of IS fighters, together with the continuing failure of Iraqi politicians to agree on a new government after an election in April, may have swayed Mr Obama.
Mr Maliki has faced calls from Sunni Arab, Kurdish and some Shia Arab leaders to step down because of their handling of the crisis.
But as leader of the bloc that won the most seats in April's parliamentary elections, they have demanded the right to attempt to form a governing coalition.

What have we learned after seven preseason games about the Toronto Raptors? (Answer: never read anything into preseason games)
DeRozan's Struggles
Let's start with the negatives. DeMar DeRozan looked absolutely terrible in six preseason contests. They put up 9.5 points, 3.5 rebounds, and three assists per game on 28.8 percent shooting from the floor and zero (seriously, they missed all eight of their attempts) from deep.
A cursory glance at their shot chart confirms our worst fears. Almost half of their attempts originated from the midrange area, where they hit just 25.9 percent.
At least the free-throw numbers were strong, which is DeRozan's saving grace in their current role as one of two lead guards on the Raptors. DeRozan took 6.7 free throws per 36 minutes, which is good, but still two off last season's average. Going by the eye test, DeRozan did find success when they attacked the basket in terms of drawing fouls despite some poor finishing.
There are two sides to these numbers.
One: DeRozan's track record is way too long for us to freak out over six preseason games. The safe bet is that DeRozan's numbers will normalize, and that he'll ultimately settle into where they always do.
Two: Losing Amir Johnson really hurts DeRozan. They played a mean two-man game, and while the on/off numbers don't bear it out, the two played together for six seasons and worked magic on hand-offs on the left side of the floor. Patrick Patterson and Luis Scola simply don't understand DeRozan's idiosyncrasies as well as Johnson.
The upshot to point one is that it's a problem, especially for anyone who held out hope that DeRozan would make a significant improvement this summer. We know they work hard, we know he's a gym rat, we know he's improved a lot to get to this point, but any hope of DeRozan finally improving their 3-point shot, well, it's long overdue. Let go of that hope.
As for the second, if my theory is true, then it could partially explain Patterson's struggles. Those two need to work in tandem the way Johnson and DeRozan did, and hopefully, with more understanding, they can help each other get better. The hope is that Patterson opens more room for DeRozan to attack, while DeRozan's drives free up Patterson for open looks.
But for someone who might command a maximum contract next summer, it'd be great if it wasn't always hope with DeRozan.
Improved Rebounding
Dwane Casey said rebounding is Toronto's biggest weakness. Last year's team ranked 26th and was bad on defensive boards (25th in DRB%). — Ryan Wolstat (@WolstatSun) October 10, 2015
Good news: the Raptors ranked third in defensive rebounding percentage this preseason. They secured 80.7 percent of their misses.
I have two theories about this.
First, icing pick-and-rolls has naturally kept bigs closer to the basket, which is making rebounding an easier endeavor. Instead of having Patterson or Valanciunas stretched out to the perimeter to hedge and trap, they're in the paint and in better position to grab misses.
Head coach Dwane Casey foretold this result in an interview with the National Post's Eric Koreen during training camp.
“It's not rocket science or anything Earth shattering,” Casey said. “We're doing some things to keep them closer to the bucket, number one to help them in the pick-and-roll situation, and number two, to help them rebounding-wise on the defensive end. Our defensive rebounding percentage was terrible.”
Second, the Raptors are doing a better job of gang rebounding with their guards. Last season, wings would routinely leak out in hopes of poaching easy cherry-picking points. Lou Williams comes to mind. Further supporting this theory is the Raptors' pace score, which ranked dead last in preseason, slower than even the Memphis Grizzlies. There's a trade-off, but it's hard to fix big problems.
Big Money Additions Making Big Money Plays
There are no guarantees that a player will remain consistent after changing teams. That especially applies to role players coming from team-oriented schemes like the Spurs and the Hawks.
Essentially, what I'm saying is that there's no shortage of uncertainty surrounding DeMarre Carroll and Cory Joseph. The Raptors gave them big money with the hope that their games can carry over from their last stops. And since the Raptors aren't anything like the Spurs or the Hawks, I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that I had my reservations.
Their preseason showings, however, have eased them ever so slightly.
Let's start with Carroll. He's supposed to be everything Terrence Ross wasn't, and true to form, he's been exactly that. He's locking players down on defense, which was to be expected, but he's also showing an expanded offensive arsenal. We're seeing Carroll run a few pick-and-rolls (something they never did with the Hawks last season) and he's shown an ability to make plays when the ball is swung to him. A few drives to the basket, making smart passes inside, creating their own shot (too many pull-up long twos for my liking, but hopefully that fades) in addition to their patented cuts to the basket. They actually are everything Ross was supposed to be.
He's just a smart, instinctive player who understands how they can contribute to winning. Their averages of 11.3 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 37.9 percent shooting from deep doesn't leap off the page, but here's something that does: the Raptors scored like a top-five offense and a top-10 defense with Carroll on the floor.
The same can be said of Joseph, who averaged 9.9 points, 1.7 rebounds, and 3.3 assists in 21.2 minutes per game. Again, not massive numbers, but tonnes of positives once you look deeper.
First off, Joseph showed a knack for getting to the basket, which is great, because the Raptors now have three to four players between Lowry, DeRozan, Carroll, and Joseph who can drive the ball to the hoop. Generating penetration and forcing help rotations is a surefire way to generate quality offense.
There's a certain craftiness about Joseph's attacks. He's always bouncing on their feet and looking to react to how the defense plays him. One false step, and Joseph has the quickness to blow by their man.
Joseph also canned their fair share of jumpers, which is definitely their biggest weakness on offense. The 3-point shot is a bit slow and inconsistent, but they hit 42.9 percent from deep, and for the most part, they hit them when they were open. The ability to hit jumpers also makes me excited about the two point guard lineup possibilities with Joseph and Lowry.
Finally, there's the defense. I've seen enough of Jose Calderon, Greivis Vasquez, and Lou Williams coming off the bench to play offense and loaf on defense. Joseph goes and gets it, plain and simple. They position themselves beautifully, they have quick feet, and most importantly, he's just flat-out willing to defend. Expect more of this during the regular season:
Sure, Marcin Gortat hit the shot, but it was their center taking a long two with the shot clock expiring. Why did Washington end up with that shot? Because Joseph navigated through three screens – two on-ball actions and a pin down – to cut off the point guard Ramon Sessions at the point of attack.
Joseph and Carroll are going to be crowd favorites. They've already won me over, and it's just preseason.

When the halibut on my hook breaks the surface, writhing in a splash of seawater off the coast of Bolinas, California, I am thinking less of this fish's fate than of my own. Considering that I plan to kill and eat it, this might seem cruel. Yet inside the fat and muscle cells of this flat, odd-looking creature is a substance as poisonous to me as it is to him: methylmercury, the most common form of mercury that builds up inside people (and fish). At the right dose and duration of exposure, mercury can impair a person's memory, ability to learn, and behavior; it can also damage the heart and immune system. Even in small quantities, this heavy metal can cause birth defects in fetuses exposed in the womb and in breast-fed newborns whose mothers' milk is laced with it.
Scientists have assured me that one serving of halibut contains nowhere near a dosage that might cause harm. These are the same scientists, though, who admit that no one knows for sure what the threshold dose is that causes mercury to subtly poison cells in the brain and the liver, two organs where it tends to accumulate.
As frightening as that sounds, most of us were born with a defense against exposure to mercury, initiated by specific sequences of genetic code that cause most people to expel the metal in 30 to 40 days. Not everyone carries this natural resistance, however. A small minority of people carry a genetic mutation that apparently causes their cells to retain mercury for far longer—in rare cases up to 190 days—greatly increasing the chance for cellular damage.
Such genetic differences may explain why some people are more susceptible to mercury poisoning than others. This possibility is driving a nascent but growing effort among scientists to link the impact of mercury and other environmental factors (everything from pollutants and diet to the sun's ultraviolet rays) to the individual genetic proclivities that each of us is born with. “Toxicologists say that ‘the dose makes the poison,'” says mercury expert Jane Hightower, who practices internal medicine in San Francisco, “but it's clear that some people are more sensitive to even small exposures than others.”
For lack of a better term, I'll call this new science human envirogenomics, the fusing of environmental toxicology and genetics, two fields that until recently didn't interact much with each other. Yet researchers are finding that the interplay of the two makes us who we are and often determines whether we are healthy or sick. “Recent increases in chronic diseases like childhood asthma and autism cannot be due to major shifts in the human gene pool,” says physician and geneticist Francis Collins, former director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. While acknowledging that changes in diagnostic criteria and heightened awareness may play a role, Collins says that much of the increase “must be due to changes in the environment, which may produce disease in genetically predisposed persons.” One day, envirogenomics could provide clues to a person's sensitivity to environmental toxins (such as mercury) and the potential for damage based on that person's genes. Doctors might then better understand how to prevent such harm and how to treat patients exposed to deleterious chemicals.
Man versus mercury
The possible connection between mercury and my own DNA is why I'm now holding a quivering fishing rod on the bow of the Osprey, a weathered 24-foot trawler. I am conducting an investigation: testing my mercury levels before and after eating this fish—assuming I land him—and checking my personal genetic code to see if I am one of the lucky ones who seem to expel mercury quickly. At the same time, I can't help but wonder if this self-experiment is a sign that I am indeed sensitive to mercury and that it has already addled my brain. My hope is that these tests, plus discussions with experts around the world and a visit to an envirogeneticist in Maine, will help guide my decision when choosing between a large fish and, say, a bowl of pasta the next time I'm in a restaurant.
This exploration is the opening salvo in an extensive project in which I am treating myself as a human guinea pig, exploring four major new areas of personal testing: genes, environment, brain, and body. In essence I am aiming to answer two big, personal questions: How healthy am I at the very deepest level? And what can the seemingly endless profusion of new high-tech tests for various diseases and traits tell me about my health now and in the future?
My fish trial began a few days earlier when I gave up nine milliliters of blood and a cupful of pee to test my normal level of methylmercury—that is, the background level that I typically have in my body from living in 21st-century San Francisco. I'll give up another round of bodily fluids after eating today's catch for lunch and some store-bought swordfish for dinner.
In my “before” test for methylmercury, I registered a level of less than 4 µg/l (micrograms per liter), safely below the EPA threshold of 5.8 µg/l. This is a relief. But will my “after” level be higher?
Big fish are by far the most prevalent source of human mercury exposure, although researchers are exploring a number of other potential contributors. In 2008 a study at Boston University tested traditional herbal products manufactured in India and the United States and found lead, mercury, or arsenic in about one-fifth of them. Last year the FDA cited another potential source of harm for children and, through their mothers, fetuses: mercury contained in dental amalgams (those silvery fillings many of us have in our teeth). But the FDA has reserved judgment on health impacts for those of us who are not in early development and who do not have a medical condition making us more sensitive to mercury.
Methylmercury got into my fish from the coal-burning power plants that rim the northern Pacific Ocean, from the United States and Mexico to Japan and China. Expelled from tall stacks, mercury stays in the upper atmosphere until rain carries it down over the eastern Pacific, where it joins mercury from other sources as bacteria and other microorganisms transform it into methylmercury. After being absorbed by plankton, the mercury moves up the food chain: The plankton is eaten by small fish, which are then gobbled up by larger predators, each bigger animal accumulating more mercury with every meal. This process extends to the halibut that was now tiring and allowing me to reel it in as the Osprey's captain, Josh Churchman—a man in their fifties with a stubbly beard, graying hair, and a faded baseball cap—leaned far over a gunwale with a net.
Image caption Time magazine labelled Wirathu "the face of Buddhist terror"
This week, religious violence has once again flared in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. Hundreds of Muslim homes have been burnt to the ground in Sagaing region after being attacked by Buddhist mobs.
In just over a year, more than 200 people, mostly Muslims, have been killed and many more displaced as unrest has spread from Rakhine state in the west to towns across the country.
Many are blaming a controversial monk and the nationalist organisation they help lead for the rising tensions.
In a classroom at one of Mandalay's most famous monasteries, a teacher is at work. Shin Wirathu is taking a class of young monks at Masoeyin through the five precepts or pillars of the Buddhist faith.
This morning, they are lecturing on the importance of avoiding sexual misconduct.
"Yes, venerable monk," the young men chant in unison, as Wirathu softly delivers their advice on the need to avoid temptation.
Image caption Monk Kaylar Sa said the 969 movement was unnecessary
When the class is over, they show me outside. On the wall of the monastery courtyard are graphic posters of the Buddhist victims of recent religious and ethnic violence in Rakhine state in western Myanmar.
They are unpleasant viewing. The pictures from October last year show dead children with their heads cut open and the bodies of women with their internal organs spilling out of their torsos.
Wirathu said they put them up as a reminder to Buddhists that the country is under attack from Muslim "invaders".
"Muslims are only well behaved when they are weak, " they said. "When they become strong, they are like a wolf or a jackal; in large packs they hunt down other animals."
Wirathu believes there is a Muslim "master plan" underway to turn Myanmar into an Islamic state.
If they are right, it is a long-term project. Latest estimates suggest that of Myanmar's 60 million people, 90% are Buddhist and about 5% Muslim.
"Over the past 50 years, we have shopped at Muslim shops and then they became richer and wealthier than us and can buy and marry our girls," Wirathu said. "In this way, they have destroyed and penetrated not only our nation but also our religion."
'Master plan'
Image caption Muslims keep watch over Joon Mosque, the biggest in Mandalay, every night
Wirathu's solution lies in a controversial nationalist organisation called 969. It calls on Buddhists to shop, sell property and marry within their own religion.
Small, brightly-coloured stickers have been distributed to clearly brand businesses as Buddhist-owned.
Supporters of 969 argue it is a purely defensive organisation, created to protect Buddhist culture and identity. Listening to the rhetoric of Wirathu and 969's leaders, there is no doubt it is squarely aimed at Muslims.
We are just preaching and posting on the internet and Facebook for the safety and security of our nation Wirathu, Buddhist monk
"In the past, there was no discrimination based on religion and race. We all stayed together in a brotherly way," Wirathu said. "But when their [Muslim] master plan has been revealed we can no longer stay quiet."
From Rakhine state in the west, to more central towns like Meiktila and Okkan, the link is being made between heightened religious tensions and the preaching and activities of monks and 969.
The outbreaks of violence usually have a depressing symmetry.
A small flashpoint, often a crime or perceived insult, perpetrated by a Muslim against a Buddhist, triggers a disproportionate wave of reprisals against the entire Muslim community.
Ten years ago, under the military junta, Wirathu was jailed for their anti-Muslim views. Now in these times of change, their message is widely disseminated through social media and DVDs. Far from being condemned, Wirathu now has backing from the very top.
In June, as their infamy reached its peak, Wirathu appeared on the front cover of Time magazine labelled "The face of Buddhist terror". Burmese monks were outraged and Myanmar's President Thein Sein quickly leapt to Wirathu's defence.
The Time issue was banned and a statement released with the president lauding Wirathu as a "son of Lord Buddha".
'Obstacle to reform'
Image caption Smar Nyi Nyi said religious tensions distracted the public from important issues
There is no shortage of theories inside Myanmar as to why Wirathu is now flavour of the month.
One theory is that continuing ethnic and religious violence could be used by the military as a pretext for maintaining a dominant role in Burmese politics. It is certainly an argument Myanmar's generals have made before.
"We are also wondering about this," Kaylar Sa, a monk jailed for their part in the Saffron revolution of 2007, told me as they chain-smoked their way through a pack of Red Ruby cigarettes.
They pointed out that the government has acted decisively and violently to end monk-led demonstrations against an army-backed copper mine last year, and yet now was unwilling to tackle them over hate speech.
"At the moment, we firmly believe that the 969 movement is unnecessary," they said. "If this movement continues to be taken seriously, it could become an obstacle to democratic reform."
A short drive from Wirathu's monastery, Muslim volunteers guard Joon Mosque, the biggest in Mandalay, each night. The men told me that in the event of a Buddhist attack, they expect no protection from the (Buddhist-dominated) police or the army.
Smar Nyi Nyi, a veteran of the 1988 student uprising and one of the elders at the mosque, took me to one side. They expressed views that many Burmese shares, that shadowy elements within the establishment are stoking the unrest.
"Everybody is talking about the violence between Buddhists and Muslims," they said. "Nobody is interested in the dam on the Irrawaddy River. No one is interested in the gas pipeline. If somebody is controlling things, they are a smart man!"
Some Muslims cling to the hope that there exists a silent majority of moderate Buddhists appalled by recent events, secretly rooting for them.
"Most of the Buddhists, they are just onlookers " a retired Muslim doctor tells me with a shrug. "A few might pass a heartfelt regard and say they're sorry, but that doesn't come above the surface."
For Wirathu, each fresh outbreak of religious conflict reinforces their view that Myanmar is part of a global war on militant Islam and that they are being badly misunderstood.
"We don't use drones - we haven't killed [Osama] Bin Laden or Saddam Hussein or the Taliban," they told me.
"We are just preaching and posting on the internet and Facebook for the safety and security of our nation. If we are all protecting our own nation who's the bad guy - Wirathu or Barack Obama?"
Hello everyone !
It´s been a year since the first release of Shadow over the Pathoras. During the year I stumbled upon some graphics resources I did not have access to during the development, discovered some ideas that could improve the mod and recieved some useful feedback.
So I decided to update the mod one more time and added some previously lacking features and fixed some issues.
The most noticeable feature is an addition of GlDef (opengl) lighting to fire statues of Carastasus,magical projectiles and to blunderbuss (previous versions supported torches only ). Now are the explorations and fights much more atmospheric.
Another big change is a new map06 - Shadow Wood and addition of map81 - The Royal Proving Grounds. I received mixed feedback on map06 due to its narrow design. So during the making of this version I decided to scrap it and made a new one with more open space. The Royal Proving grounds is a DM only area, that can be accesed via map80 - The Fortress. This map used to be part of a now cancelled expansion pack for SOTP, but it will serve it´s purpose in this mod too.
Because the later maps are huge in sizes (Passus, Tereagen) and some players found them a bit confusing at times I added a new map power-up to the biggest maps. This power-up reveals the whole map with all items and monsters. It is usually located in peripheries of the maps.
Now to the weapons. The blunderbuss was reworked to be slightly stronger - now it can kill a lizardman in one hit (compared to 3 in the older versions) and has new "more badass" firing sound, that will alert nearby monsters or players in DM. The battle axe now has an enchanted mode too - it shoots strong ice projectiles with decent firing rate.
The final boss has also been reworked and is now stronger and more challenging (he can shoot magic missiles at long distances and use a sword/shield in close fight).
The last thing are updated golem sprites, addition of signs in towns, bushes and dead tree with leaves from Hexen can be set on fire (good in DM),some sounds have been changed and monster ammo drops have been tweaked as well.

The majority of Americans are tired of Sarah Palin's unsolicited political pronouncements, according to a new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Annenberg poll.
Fifty-four percent of voters think the former GOP vice presidential nominee is too outspoken on the issues, a total which includes two-thirds of Democrats, a majority of Independents, and perhaps most surprisingly, four-in-10 Republicans.
This new poll comes in the wake of calls for the impeachment of President Barack Obama by the ex-Alaska governor over their handling of the ongoing immigration crisis at the border.
The NBC/WSJ/Annenberg poll was conducted between June 30 to July 7 among 1,137 registered voters (though it wasn't conducted July 4). The margin of error of these registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.
If there is a silver lining for Palin in this poll, it's that she's not the only political figure who's wearing out their welcome with the American public. Fifty-one percent of voters no longer want to hear what Rev. Jesse Jackson has to say about politics. Forty-five percent feel the same way about former Vice President Dick Cheney, followed by Newt Gingrich at 43% and former Vice President Al Gore at 40%.
Even former president Bill Clinton, who routinely scores high approval ratings, turns off about 32% of the public.
The poll also explored attitudes about President Obama and the economy. According to the results, while 52% of the country acknowledges the economy has improved under the president's watch, only 36% are willing to give them credit for it. Another 47% argue the economy hasn't improved under Obama.
Meanwhile, a combined 52% of voters believe that the president's signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, needs a major overhaul or needs to be repealed. On the other hand, a combined 43% of voters say that it only needs minor modifications or should be left as it is.
Palin's calls for the president's impeachment have drawn heavy criticism, even from within their own party. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Wednesday they disagree with Palin's call for Obama's removal from office.

Particle physics. To some, the words may produce anxiety. And while, yes, it is complicated — it is far from incomprehensible. On May 3, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, better known as CERN, held its first TEDx event, an illuminating look at how particle physics intersects with other disciplines.
As part of TEDxCERN, physicists from the famous institution, home of the Large Hadron Collider (and birthplace of the Word Wide Web), teamed up with animators from TED-Ed to create easy-to-understand animated lessons that explain concepts like dark matter, big data and the Higgs boson in lay terms.
Below, watch all five animations and find out: How did the universe begin? What's up with antimatter? And why is everyone so excited about the Higgs boson? Enjoyable whether you are new to these terms or have been studying them for years.
The beginning of the universe, for beginners. (Lesson by Tom Whyntie, animation by Hornet Inc.)
How did the universe begin — and how is it expanding? CERN physicist Tom Whyntie shows how cosmologists and particle physicists explore these questions by replicating the heat, energy and activity of the first few seconds of our universe, from right after the Big Bang.
Exploration on the Big Data frontier. (Lesson by Tim Smith, animation by TED-Ed.)
There is a mind-boggling amount of data floating around our society. Physicists at CERN have been pondering how to store and share their data for decades – stimulating globalization of the internet along the way, while “solving” their big data problem. Tim Smith plots CERN's involvement with big data from 50 years ago to today.
Dark matter: The matter we can't see. (Lesson by James Gillies, animation by TED-Ed.)
The Greeks had a simple and elegant formula for the universe: earth, fire, wind and water. Turns out there's more to it than that — a lot more. Visible matter (and that goes beyond the four Greek elements) comprises only 4% of the universe. CERN scientist James Gillies tells us what accounts for the remaining 96% (dark matter and dark energy) and how we might go about detecting it.
What happened to antimatter? (Lesson by Rolf Landua, animation by TED-Ed.)
Particles come in pairs, which is why there should be an equal amount of matter and antimatter in the universe. Yet scientists have not been able to detect antimatter in the visible universe. Where is this missing particle? CERN scientist Rolf Landua returns to the seconds after the Big Bang to explain the disparity that allows humans to exist today.
The basics of boson. (Lesson by Dave Barney and Steven Goldfarb, animation by Jeanette Nørgaard.)
In 2012, scientists at CERN discovered evidence of the Higgs boson. The what? The Higgs boson is one of two types of fundamental particles, and it's a particular game-changer in the field of particle physics, proving how particles gain mass. Using the Socratic method, CERN scientists Dave Barney and Steve Goldfarb explain the exciting implications of the Higgs boson.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., brushed off former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs' prediction that Obamacare's twice-delayed employer mandate will never take effect by suggesting they are being paid to talk down the law that they touted as it moved through Congress.
"Robert Gibbs' opinion, I don't know who their clients are or what their perspective is, but we are celebrating the fact that we have over seven million who have signed up, not counting the 3.1 million who are a, on the policies of their parents until they're 26 years old, not including over three million and probably closer to five million on Medicaid, which would bring us close to 15 million people who, uh, now have quality, affordable health care," Pelosi told CNN's Candy Crowley.
Gibbs predicted the employer mandate would never take effect at a conference last week. "It's a small part of the law," they said. "I think it will be one of the first things to go.”
Pelosi disagreed, calling the employer mandate "integral" to the success of the law. "[Obamacare] has strong pillars in it, that relate to each other," they said.
Last week, the news that University College London's students' union (UCLU) had, in March of this year, voted to ban a Nietzsche reading group rattled Twitter and the comment pages. Originally set up as ‘Tradition UCL', the group had put up posters on campus promoting such philosophers as Alain de Benoist, Julius Evola and Martin Heidegger, and bearing slogans like ‘Equality is a false god', and ‘Too much political correctness?'.
The group itself, which has failed so far to release a statement, seems, at worst, to be a pretty small and batty clique. A group so avowedly committed to ‘traditionalist art and philosophy' may well not be the most popular society at the UCL freshers' fair. Nevertheless, on the issue of political correctness, it may well have a point, given that UCLU promptly deemed the ‘Nietzsche Group' very politically incorrect by voting to deny it any union funding or benefits for two years on the grounds the group was ‘promoting a far-right, fascist ideology at UCL' which threatened the ‘safety of the UCL student body and UCLU members'. News of the ban, which had largely gone unreported until spiked's Free Speech Now! campaign brought it to light, was rightly met with contempt by various students, academics and onlookers. Indeed, UCLU's actions seemed to undermine completely the entire purpose of a university. The study of problematic, even anti-human and far-right-leaning thinkers, especially those as seminal as Nietzsche or Heidegger, is essential to a rigorous academic environment. As one witty tweeter put it: ‘This is absurd. University is pretty much the only place where anyone reads Nietzsche.'
UCLU's use of anti-fascist rhetoric to justify the ban made the move seem all the more unhinged. To equate the quashing of one wacky reading group with a grand fight against the far-right is tenuous at best. As has been noted recently on spiked, anti-fascism in the UK has become little more than political shadow play. In the absence of any meaningful left-wing consensus, anti-fascist groups are merely fluffing up the spectre of fascism in order to have a clear enemy to strike progressive poses at. UCLU officers, who have long had a reputation for being Eighties-esque mockney-Marxist throwbacks, seem to be completely divorced from reality when they claimed the ban was part of ‘a united front of students, workers, trade unions and the wider labour movement'. (With a measly 16.3 per cent turnout in the last union elections, the UCLU executive can barely claim ‘solidarity' with UCL students, let alone some burgeoning workers' movement.) But even the most sympathetic observer would find it hard to justify UCLU's handling of the Nietzsche Group debacle. Last Friday, UCLU released a statement defending its ban and putting it in the context of a 2013 policy, passed by the union, that gives it powers to ‘deny a platform' to fascist organisations – namedropping the British National Party (BNP) and the English Defence League (EDL), despite the fact that both groups had, by 2013, effectively imploded. By raising the spectre of ‘No Platform', UCLU showed itself to be even more cut off from its contemporaries. The No Platform policy, which was adopted by the National Union of Students (NUS) in 1974 and used by various anti-fascist groups over the past 30-or-more years, has been roundly discredited. While it remains on the NUS's books, most UK universities have either overturned it or simply refused to enforce it. Even anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate announced that it had dropped the policy in 2013, with coordinator Nick Lowles saying that the policy was ‘ineffective' and that Hope Not Hate would rather ‘be in the argument' with the far-right.
However, while this particular ban seems to fly in the face of common sense, as well as popular opinion among student and anti-fascist activists, UCLU's decision is hardly an aberration. Over recent years, student unions in the UK have attempted to ban everything from pro-life societies to supposedly ‘sexist' materials, such as the Sun newspaper's topless Page 3 feature. While No Platform may seem like a dusty relic, its underlying logic – that some ideas are too explosive to be aired and some students are too feeble-minded to challenge them in an open forum – has remained unchallenged. From No More Page 3 to No More Nietzsche, the legacy of No Platform lives on. If anything, British student unions have become even more patronising of late. While No Platform policies were originally justified on the grounds that students might unthinkingly imbibe fascist ideas if they were exposed to them, the bans of today are argued for in the language of safety. The suggestion from UCLU that the Nietzsche society threatened the ‘safety of the UCL student body' speaks to a trend in which ideas and words, in and of themselves, are seen to pose a direct danger to students, who is a student politicos assume will be so offended by a Nietzsche poster or a topless spread in the Sun that they'll be reduced to a quivering wreck.
"Placental" redirects here. For the organ interfacing between a placental mammalian mother and a fetus, see Placenta
Placentalia ("Placentals") is one of the three extant subdivisions of the class of animals Mammalia; the other two are Monotremata and Marsupialia. The Placentals are partly distinguishable from other mammals in that the fetus is carried in the uterus of its mother to a relatively late stage of development. It is somewhat of a misnomer since marsupials also nourish their fetuses via a placenta.[4]
Anatomical features [ edit ]
Placental mammals are anatomically distinguished from other mammals by:
a sufficiently wide opening at the bottom of the pelvis to allow the birth of a large baby relative to the size of the mother. [5]
the absence of epipubic bones extending forward from the pelvis, which are found in all other mammals. [6] (Their function in non-placental mammals is to stiffen the body during locomotion, [7] but in placentals they would inhibit the expansion of the abdomen during pregnancy.) [8]
(Their function in non-placental mammals is to stiffen the body during locomotion, but in placentals they would inhibit the expansion of the abdomen during pregnancy.) the rearmost bones of the foot fit into a socket formed by the ends of the tibia and fibula, forming a complete mortise and tenon upper ankle joint. [9]
the presence of a malleolus at the bottom of the fibula.[9]
Subdivisions [ edit ]
Analysis of retroposon presence/absence patterns has provided a rapid, unequivocal means for revealing the evolutionary history of organisms: this has resulted in a revision in the classification of placentals.[10] There are now thought to be three major subdivisions or lineages of placental mammals: Boreoeutheria, Xenarthra, and Afrotheria, all of which diverged from common ancestors.
The orders of placental mammals in the three groups are:[11]
The exact relationships among these three lineages is currently a subject of debate, and three different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is basal or diverged first from other placentals. These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (basal Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (basal Xenarthra), and Exafroplacentalia (basal Afrotheria).[12] Estimates for the divergence times among these three placental groups range from 105 to 120 million years ago (MYA), depending on the type of DNA (e.g. nuclear or mitochondrial)[13] and varying interpretations of paleogeographic data.[12]
Placentalia Atlantogenata Afrotheria Xenarthra Boreoeutheria Euarchontoglires Euarchonta Glires Laurasiatheria Eulipotyphla Scrotifera Chiroptera Ferungulata Euungulata Cetartiodactyla Perissodactyla Ferae Pholidota Carnivora
Cladogram based on Amrine-Madsen, H. et al. (2003)[14] and Asher, R.J. et al. (2009)[15]
Evolution [ edit ]
True placental mammals (the crown group including all modern placentals) arose from stem-group members of the clade Eutheria, which had existed since at least the Middle Jurassic period, about 170 MYA). These early eutherians were small, nocturnal insect eaters, with adaptations for life in trees.[9]
True placentals may have originated in the Late Cretaceous around 90 MYA, but the earliest undisputed fossils are from the early Paleocene, 66 MYA, following the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The species Protungulatum donnae was thought to be a stem-ungulate [16] known 1 meter above the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary in the geological stratum that marks the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event [17] and Purgatorius, previously considered a stem-primate, appears no more than 300,000 years after the K-Pg boundary;[18] both species, however, are now considered non-placental eutherians.[19] The rapid appearance of placentals after the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous suggests that the group had already originated and undergone an initial diversification in the Late Cretaceous, as suggested by molecular clocks.[3] The lineages leading to Xenarthra and Afrotheria probably originated around 90 MYA, and Boreoeutheria underwent an initial diversification around 70-80 MYA,[3] producing the lineages that eventually would lead to modern primates, rodents, insectivores, artiodactyls, and carnivorans.
However, modern members of the placental orders originated in the Paleogene around 66 to 23 MYA, following the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The evolution of crown orders such modern primates, rodents, and carnivores appears to be part of an adaptive radiation[20] that took place as mammals quickly evolved to take advantage of ecological niches that were left open when most dinosaurs and other animals disappeared following the Chicxulub asteroid impact. As they occupied new niches, mammals rapidly increased in body size, and began to take over the large herbivore and large carnivore niches that had been left open by the decimation of the dinosaurs. Mammals also exploited niches that the dinosaurs had never touched: for example, bats evolved flight and echolocation, allowing them to be highly effective nocturnal, aerial insectivores; and whales first occupied freshwater lakes and rivers and then moved into the oceans. Primates, meanwhile, acquired specialized grasping hands and feet which allowed them to grasp branches, and large eyes with keener vision which allowed them to forage in the dark.
The evolution of land placentals followed different pathways on different continents since they cannot easily cross large bodies of water. An exception is smaller placentals such as rodents and primates, who left Laurasia and colonized Africa and then South America via rafting.
In Africa, the Afrotheria underwent a major adaptive radiation, which led to elephants, elephant shrews, tenrecs, golden moles, aardvarks, and manatees. In South America a similar event occurred, with radiation of the Xenarthra, which led to modern sloths, anteaters, and armadillos, as well as the extinct ground sloths and glyptodonts. Expansion in Laurasia was dominated by Boreoeutheria, which includes primates and rodents, insectivores, carnivores, perissodactyls and artiodactyls. These groups expanded beyond a single continent when land bridges formed linking Africa to Eurasia and South America to North America.

Today's letter-to-the-editor appears in the Democrat News of Fredericktown, Missouri. It's titled Biblical reference to stars. The newspaper has a comments feature.
Because today's writer isn't a politician, preacher, or other public figure, we won't embarrass or promote them by using their full name. In fact, their full name isn't given. At the end of the letter, the newspaper says: “Jennie is a long-time resident of Fredericktown, an eclectic gatherer of stories, information, and experiences to share with whoever would like to read them.” So we'll call them Jennie. Excerpts from their letter will be enhanced with our Curmudgeonly commentary and some bold font for emphasis. Here we go!
There's an overwhelming amount of amazing information in the book of Job. The reason I am zoning in on this particular area is because I just learned the meaning of another jewel that proves God is from the beginning, Creation of everything and prove [ sic ] to be true by modern studies of Celestial Science.
Jennie's letter is short, but we're including it in our collection because their argument is very original. They say:
As time passes “new” information is revealed. Not because it is really new, but because we become able to comprehend more, due to scientific study, and new technology, etc. The verse I am referring to occurs in Job 38:31, part of Gods [ sic ] answer to Job concerning the vast realm that exists between Himself and humankind.
Then they quote Job 38:31:
Canst thou bind The cluster of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
We checked. It's different in the King James version, which says:
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
We don't know what bible translation, if any, uses the expression “cluster of Pleiades.” Let's get on with Jennie's letter:
I never knew what God was talking about in this verse of scripture, or the enormity of Their revelation. Just think on this; who, but God, from the beginning could have known, that this particular cluster of stars, the Pleiades, are gravitationally bound together? Could anybody except God make such a thing happen?
The bible says the Pleiades are “gravitationally bound together”? Well, okay. Let's read on:
The constellation of Orion, the hunter, wears a band (belt). That's cool, but what I found out just blew me out of the water.
Ooooooooh! What did Jennie find out? They tell us:
The stars that make up Orion's band are very far away from each other and all of them various sizes.
So what? Jennie explains:
We see them in order around their waist, fitting perfectly into the constellation the same as they did the day they were made.
Ooooooooh! That's amazing! Here's the end of their letter:
We see them with our eyes, because that is what God intended. This is just another affirmation for us from our God and creator. Amen.
Well, it was original.

In news that isn't terribly surprising, the NCAA has denied Arizona State's request for a waiver that would have allowed it to play in a bowl game as a 6-6 team despite two wins against FCS foes.
It's not surprising because there are already 70 bowl-eligible teams for 35 spots. A Sun Devils waiver would have meant an eligible team would have gotten the shaft.
Here's Doug Haller on the matter.
Arizona State provided a quote for Dennis Erickson: "It is a pretty steadfast rule, but I thought we had a chance in our discussions with the NCAA because of our situation. They didn't OK it and I understand that. We end up going 6-6 and beating the University of Arizona. We would have liked to have played another game, but we didn't win seven games, that's the bottom line. We did finish the season like we wanted. I'll take that game last night over any bowl game."

Washington, DC –As the fight over the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline seems be accelerating towards a final decision, protestors are turning up the heat on President Obama to reject the project with a major, youth-led protest at the White House this weekend called “XL Dissent.”
More than 1,000 students and youth from across the country have signed up to take part in a march to the White House from Georgetown University, where President Obama laid out their “climate test” for the pipeline this summer. Once there, more than 300 youth are expected to risk arrest in a sit-in, the largest youth act of civil disobedience at the White House in a generation.
The young people represent over 50 colleges and universities and are taking action in solidarity with groups on the frontlines of dirty energy expansion and climate impacts, such as First Nations and refining communities, ranchers and farmers along the route, and those fighting tar sands expansion in Michigan and beyond.
Press are invited to interview students at the Thurgood Marshall Center on Saturday, from 1:00-4:00pm, or on Sunday at either the rally beginning at Georgetown at 10:00am or at the White House rally beginning at 11:30am.
Here is a full schedule of the weekend's events:
Saturday, March 1
Location: Thurgood Marshall Center, 1816 12th St NW, Washington, DC
12:00-4:00pm: Fossil Fuel Divestment Meetup
Hundreds of students from across the country will come together to share strategies and tactics for the growing fossil fuel divestment movement that has spread to over 300 colleges and universities.
5:00pm-9:00pm: Nonviolent Direct Action Training (closed to press)
Students will take part in a NVDA training to prepare for Sunday's sit-in at the White House.
Sunday, March 2
Location: Georgetown University to Lafayette Park & White House
10:00am: Rally at Georgetown University's Red Square to kick off the day's events
10:20-11:30am: March from Georgetown to Lafayette Park
The march will begin at Georgetown University, head East on O St, South on Wisconsin, East on M St., East on Penn, and East on H St. to Lafayette Park.
10:30am: Rally Outside Secretary of State John Kerry's House
Youth will rally outside Sec. Kerry's house on O St. with a banner that reads “Sec. Kerry: Don't Tar Your Legacy” to push them to recommend that President Obama reject the pipeline.
11:30am-12:15pm: Rally at Lafayette Park
Speakers will include youth leaders and representatives from communities that would be impacted by the Keystone XL pipeline, as well as those on the frontlines of other dirty energy developments and the climate crisis.
12:15pm-1:00pm: White House Sit-in
At least 300 youth are expected to risk arrest in sit-in on the sidewalk in front of the White House fence.

The word bizarre doesn't even begin to cover how the McCain campaign presents itself to my eyes. For a minute or two I was taken in by McCain's announcement on Wednesday. I wondered if this would play out right in American voters' minds. “Patriotism and putting the country first always goes down well with the American public” I have been told in my political science seminars. But the unbelievably incompetent execution of McCain's ill thought-out plan and the resulting developments in the race from Wednesday till tonight, the total public disintegration of a presidential campaign within a timeframe that you can still measure in hours, is something I would not have thought possible.
As details are emerging about the dismal performance during the White House crisis meeting, John McCain eats their own words and heads to Mississippi for tonight's debate with Barack Obama. They can't, now that their incompetence is so very obvious and the Democrats have called their bluff. And they are in it to win it. So much so that the McCain campaign has issued a campaign ad claiming McCain had won the debate. A wee bit premature. Not only hasn't the debate even started yet, the ad already has been published before McCain even announced their participation in the thing.

Should I buy camera X or Y? This is, sadly, one of the most common question I have ever heard. One can spend hours reinforcing the idea that maybe lenses or lights (or skills) are far more interesting investments, that question always comes back to irritate me. ‘Should I buy camera X or Y'. The only answer I could give, to the great frustration of some of my students, was: ‘Well, it depends on”
Every new month, reviews, comparisons and shootout tests are released online. By the time you might have finally made a decision regarding your investments, a bunch of new cameras would have been announced and released to the market, just to make you doubt a little more. In 2011 and 2012 Zacuto released two series of camera shootout (available in their entirety on the Web Series page on their site). The shelf life of such shootouts appears to be limited. Most of the cameras used at the time are now considered old and outdated. This does not mean, however, that there is nothing to learn from an outdated camera shootout, especially if you are new to the world of Digital Cinematography.
Below, you will find selected segments from the Great Camera Shootout and the Revenge of the Great Camera Shootout video series. What are the technical aspects that define the quality of a digital camera? How can we assess and measure such aspects in an empirical fashion? Why is it essential for a DP to understand and work within the limitations of the camera? Most importantly, how do seasoned cinematographers look at the camera choice in relation to cinematography as a whole and how it al fits in the bigger ‘filmmaking picture'.
What is Dynamic Range? How can it be tested?
“The difference between the darkest object a camera can photograph and the brightest” A higher dynamic range will allow you to tackle more complicated or challenging scenes where the difference between the brightest and the darkest parts of the scene is extreme. Without a wide dynamic range you will need to modify the lighting of the scene to fit what the camera can handle.
Under-exposde Scene
Testing a camera in an underexposed scene will give you an idea of what would happen in the shadows, in terms of noise and blocking.
Over-exposde Scene
Testing the camera in an overexposed scene will give you an idea of what happens to the highlight in terms of clipping and non-linear handling of the color balance.
What is Sensitivity? How can it be tested?
Defining sensitivity for digital cameras is not as straight forward as for film. The better the sensitivity, the less noise the camera will generate in lower light.
Low Light
A low light test is useful in assessing the quantity and quality of noise in shadows area.
What is Sharpness? What are the variables that affect it?
Sharpness is affected by resolution, the edge contrast of the image and the compression of the digital footage. The lens, the sensor and the digital treatment of the image all impact the perceived sharpness of the image.
What is Compression? How does it affect your image?
Your camera might have a beautiful image coming out of the sensor. The compression, however, will impact and often lower the quality of the image you record.
What are Motion Artefacts? How can they be tested?
Ideally, your footage will be captured frame by frame, the reality, however, is that it will often be captured line by line thus introducing motion artefacts in the process. Compression can also affect the manner in which movement is reproduced.
Color rendition and how to test it?
Even a perfectly white balance imaging system will introduce non-linear rendition of the color spectrum.
Importance of Skin Tones
Skin tones are often the most commonly captured colours, and some cameras will sacrifice the rendition o other tones to maintain skin color rendition.
I suspect that this first shootout received with a fair amount of questioning and criticising. Was the test properly handled ? Were the operators familiar with the cameras they were using? But most importantly, there is a sense that the camera was left to fend for itself, without the real input of DP's magic touch.
In the following test, DP's were given 90 minutes to shape the lighting of a scene, and were thus able to work within the limitations of their imaging system. After the shoot, another 90 minutes were given in the grading scene to shape the footage as they wished. It is a far more subjective test, which better reflects the reality of working with cameras.
The Last Camera Shootout?
Color Correction is Cinematography
We tend to forget that photography is not only the act of capturing the image but also the way in which we process the image at a later stage. In digital, color correction is part of the cinematography where one might shoot within the limitations of the camera knowing in advance how the image might be altered and shifted in post.
The Test Footage
When looking at the footage, we can notice differences in quality (and qualities) between the various clips. However, these differences are not as significant as many would have expectd when pitting an iPhone against an Arri Alexa, for example. (If you'd like to know which camera is which, you can find them HERE)
The real question is: how does a Cinematographer select his/her camera? Well, it is a very subjective choice.
This does not mean there are no significant differences between pieces of equipment being sold at such different price points. It simply takes a better eye and more challenging shots for those differences to become more noticeable.
Being a Cinematographer is about so much more than selecting the right camera and understanding how and how well it works. This is where the real lesson starts.
What is a Cinematographer?
What is Light?
What matters most?
Collaborations
Talent, born or made?
Feelings and Lessons
Telling a Story
Heart of the Story
Creativity
Learning
Failure
Final Thoughts
Yes, some cameras are better than others. But, if selecting the best camera is your main preoccupation as a learner, you are missing the point. Different DP's will assess imaging systems differently, relying on different aspects for different reasons. It is an art after all, not a science.

Michael Moore dangles a pair of handcuffs in a photo from their website, where they call for the arrest of Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder over their role in the Flint water crisis. (Photo: michaelmoore.com)
Former Flint resident and film director Michael Moore tried to play celebrity peacemaker Wednesday by merely calling for Gov. Rick Snyder's arrest in the Flint water crisis instead of singer and actor Cher's suggestion of execution by a firing squad.
Moore started a petition on their website to call for the arrest of the Republican governor on charges of corruption and assault. They described the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality's slow action on the issue “premeditated” without providing any evidence.
Flint residents have been plagued by water issues since April 2014, when they began receiving drinking water drawn from the Flint River. Immediate concerns over odd tastes, smells and coloring gave way to more serious worries late this summer when rising levels of lead were detected in the blood of many of the city's children.
“Thanks to you, sir, and the premeditated actions of your administrators, you have effectively poisoned, not just some, but apparently ALL of the children in my hometown of Flint, Michigan,” Moore writes in an open letter to Snyder. “And for that, you have to go to jail.
“To poison all the children in an historic American city is no small feat. Even international terrorist organizations haven't figured out yet how to do something on a magnitude like this.”
Snyder's spokesperson David Murray said the fiery rhetoric doesn't help the situation.
“It's disappointing to see such inflammatory comments at a time when the administration is working very closely with our partners in Flint and Genesee County to address health and safety issues,” Murray said. “The state is committed to making sure Flint residents have clean, safe water.”
The U.S. Attorney's office in Detroit started an investigation into Flint's contaminated water in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency.
Flint's Democratic lawmakers have criticized Snyder's response to the crisis but have not suggested a crime was committed.
Snyder declared a state of emergency in Flint Tuesday and apologized last week for the bungled environmental oversight of the city's water after their appointed task force held the state Department of Environmental Quality “primarily responsible” for failing to ensure safe drinking water in Flint. It blamed the DEQ's passive culture and led to the resignation of its director, Dan Wyant.
Actress and singer Cher responded to Snyder's emergency declaration Tuesday by calling them a “murderer” and declaring in a hashtag: “#FIRINGSQUADWORKSFORME”
Moore was slightly more charitable.
“You have destroyed a generation of children — and for that, you must pay,” Moore wrote toward the end of their website letter to Snyder, former chairperson and CEO of Gateway Inc.
“It is time for you to go to prison. Out of mercy, I'll ask that you have in your cell your own personal Gateway computer.”

Democrats who backed wiretaps turn away Democratic bloggers from AT&T fundraiser Diane Sweet
Published: Tuesday August 26, 2008
Print This Email This AT&T security suggest bloggers talk to police Moderate Democrats are turning away Democrats, even those with press passes.
On Monday night, AT&T held a 'Blue Dog' fundraiser for the group of congressional Democrats who endorsed the recent bill that gave immunity to telecoms for President Bush's warrantless wiretapping program.
The affair was held at Mile High Station, which is one of the closest buildings to Invesco field at Mile High Stadium in Denver, Colorado where the Democratic National Convention is being held.
While delegates came in and out of the party, it wasn't as easy for approved Democratic bloggers and reporters. Amy Goodman of DemocracyNow, Jane Hamsher of Firedoglake and Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com were ushered away by event security. All three had valid press passes to cover the Democratic National Convention.
As they tried to enter the event, security guards curtly refused to permit them to enter, and ordered them away from the entrance, giving few details.
Even the guests who came and went refused to say who invited them to the affair, or give their names. Only a pair of talkative men, who identified themselves as a lobbyist, and a Republican, replied.
"Can I just ask a question?" Goodman asked. "If this is open to the delegates, why isnt it"
"Other side of the property, please," an unidentified guard replied. "The other side of the property, where the public can stand."
"But isnt this open to the delegates?" Goodman said.
"No, its not. You could talk to the police right now. Go to the other side of the property, where the rest of the public can stand, please. Here comes an officer to talk to you."
"Were confused," Goodman said. "Were press for the DNC to cover the Democratic National Convention, and Im just wondering"
"Unfortunately," the guard said. "Im just telling you what Ive been told."
Video follows of Goodman, Hamsher and Greenwald as they cover the events of the evening.
Additional transcript AMY GOODMAN: And what have you been told?
UNIDENTIFIED: I need you guys over there or over there.
AMY GOODMAN: So are you saying theres no press allowed in?
UNIDENTIFIED: Correct. Im saying that its a private party, is what Im saying.
AMY GOODMAN: So what is the party about?
PARTY PARTICIPANT: No idea. Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN: How did you get invited?
PARTY PARTICIPANT: No idea.
AMY GOODMAN: Hi. Can I ask you about the party inside?
PARTY PARTICIPANT: Thats right. Thank you.
AMY GOODMAN: Can I ask about the party and who invited you? Are you guys delegates?
PARTY PARTICIPANT: Hi. How are you?
AMY GOODMAN: Good
PARTY PARTICIPANT: No. No.
GLENN GREENWALD: Im Glenn Greenwald from Salon.com, and this is Jane Hamsher from FireDogLake, and we were here to try and cover the event, at first, and have press passes, and were trying to gain access. And we were told we couldnt get in even.
AMY GOODMAN: But you have press passes.
GLENN GREENWALD: We have a press pass.
JANE HAMSHER: We have legitimate press passes.
GLENN GREENWALD: We have legitimate press passes from the convention.
JANE HAMSHER: Issued by the DNC.
AMY GOODMAN: Are you going into the party? Are you going into the party?
PARTY PARTICIPANT: Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about who invited you?
PARTY PARTICIPANT: Excuse me.
AMY GOODMAN: Were press.
GLENN GREENWALD: Yeah, its amazing. And essentially, we probably tried to interview twenty-five, thiry people going in, and every last person refused to even give their name, identify themselves, say what theyre here for, what the event is for. Its more secretive than like a Dick Cheney energy council meeting. I mean, its amazing.
AMY GOODMAN: So, what are you here for? Why do you want to interview people?
GLENN GREENWALD: Well, because, I mean, its extraordinary that the same Blue Dogs that just gave this extremely corrupt gift to AT&T are now attending a party underwritten by AT&T, the purpose of which is to thank the Blue Dogs for the corrupt legislative gift that they got. So AT&T gives money to Blue Dogs, the Blue Dogs turn around and immunize AT&T from lawbreaking, and then AT&T throws a party at the Democratic convention thanking them, and then they all go in and into this exclusive club.
AMY GOODMAN: [inaudible] ask someone. Why dont you ask this person?
GLENN GREENWALD: Hi. Can weare you going to the party?
PARTY PARTICIPANT: I dont know.
GLENN GREENWALD: Can we ask you a couple of questions?
PARTY PARTICIPANT: Rather not, thank you.
GLENN GREENWALD: Alright, can we just ask this gentleman here?
UNIDENTIFIED: Thats private property, right here.
GLENN GREENWALD: OK, well take care of this, sir. No problem.
UNIDENTIFIED: OK.
GLENN GREENWALD: No problem. Remember, we kind of
JANE HAMSHER: Who are you with? Are you going to the party?
PARTY PARTICIPANT: Yeah.
GLENN GREENWALD: This is area right here is where it is, right here?
JANE HAMSHER: Are you going to the party?
GLENN GREENWALD: This is the magical D line?
UNIDENTIFIED: No, the next one over.
GLENN GREENWALD: Oh, I see.
UNIDENTIFIED: Almost.
LOBBYIST: You know where the Blue Dog Democrats started out? They all used to meet in Louisiana, in the office of the one conservative Democrat in the state, who had a portrait of a blue dog over their fireplace. And from that point onthis was in the late 1800s, early 1900sother conservative Democrats used to come to have this secret meeting in this place in Louisiana, and thats how they became the Blue Dog Democrats forever more.
AMY GOODMAN: Are you both delegates?
LOBBYIST: No.
REPUBLICAN GUEST: No.
LOBBYIST: Im a lobbyist.
AMY GOODMAN: Oh, a lobbyist?
LOBBYIST: The other L word.
AMY GOODMAN: A lobbyist with whom?
LOBBYIST: I do financial services and real estate.
REPUBLICAN GUEST: Im just a guest tonight. Ill tell you a secret: Im a Republican. We just got invited, so
UNIDENTIFIED: Free dinner.
REPUBLICAN GUEST: Free dinner.
AMY GOODMAN: Do you feel right at home?
REPUBLICAN GUEST: Yeah. Its a party. Hey, what the hell, right?
AMY GOODMAN: So, Medea Benjamin, why are you all out here?
MEDEA BENJAMIN: Code Pink ishas always been dogging the Blue Dogs, because the Blue Dogs are supposed to be fiscally conservative, yet they are the ones that keep cheerleading for this war and keep funding the war. But we also see that the Blue Dogs are big into the corporate sponsorship, and were here to say that, as the convention starts to begin tomorrow, the Blue Dogs should be ashamed of themselves for taking corporate money and then turning around and giving immunity to the telecoms industry for illegally spying on us.
CODE PINK PROTESTERS: Blue Dogs take cash from AT&T and give telecoms immunity. So Code Pink is here to give the dogs a bone, tell AT&T dont tap my phone!
AMY GOODMAN: And that is the Code Pink singers, outside of Mile High Stadium. In fact, that venue was Mile High Station, where AT&T was sponsoring a party for the Blue Dog Democrats.

French Front National party leader made comments at a rally in 2010, prompting anti-racism and human rights groups to bring case against them
Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right Front National, has appeared in court in Lyon on hate speech charges after they compared Muslims praying in the streets to the Nazi occupation.
Four anti-racism and human rights groups have brought a case against them on charges of “incitement to discrimination, violence or hatred towards a group of people on the basis of their religion”.
The trial begins on Tuesday and it is the first time Le Pen has faced charges for hate speech, although their father and party founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, has several convictions under the charge, including one for contesting crimes against humanity after saying the Nazi occupation of France was not “particularly inhumane”.
Le Pen made their comments in a speech during a party rally in Lyon in 2010. They referred to “street prayers” after there had been reports of Muslims praying in public in three French cities, including Paris, because of a lack of mosques or a lack of space in local prayer rooms.
They said: “I'm sorry, but for those who really like to talk about the second world war, if we're talking about occupation, we can also talk about this while we're at it, because this is an occupation of territory,” they told supporters, prompting waves of applause.
“It's an occupation of swaths of territory, of areas in which religious laws apply … for sure, there are no tanks, no soldiers, but it's an occupation all the same and it weighs on people.”
When the European parliament lifted Le Pen's parliamentary immunity in July 2013, a preliminary inquiry was opened.
The penalty for inciting racial hatred in France is up to a year in prison and a €45,000 (£33,000) fine.
The concept of having an official state firearm is a relatively new one, with Utah being the first to do it in 2011, declaring the venerable M1911 pistol to be official gun of the Beehive State. Six other states have joined in, mostly focusing on historic firearms, like Arizona picking the Colt Single Action Army revolver, or Pennsylvania selecting the Colonial-era long rifle.
Tennessee, however, decided to go big or go home; it's named the .50 Cal Barrett M82 Rifle as its official state firearm. The state Senate approved a measure naming the hulking anti-materiel rifle 27 to 1 on Wednesday, in honor of the rifle being manufactured by Tennessee-based Barrett Firearms Manufacturing.
The M82 is a fearsome, fearsome gun. Chambering a bullet that looks more suited for light artillery than a rifle, the Light Fifty has an effective range of 1,800 meters, or about 1.1 miles. It's beloved by snipers across the world, and is currently used by armed forces in over 50 countries.
Tennessee considered following what other states had done, and picking something a bit more demure and vintage, like a flintlock rifle or the Kentucky rifle, but state lawmakers were having none of it. "The flintlock was developed in France by a Frenchman. The Kentucky long rifle was developed in Pennsylvania by German and Swedish men," said state senator Mae Beavers, speaking to the Times Free Press. "So I think it's only right that we honor the ingenuity that Ronnie Barrett has had to develop this rifle."

“A blow across the shins with a racket is permissible, and broken heads are not uncommon.”
The Choctaw Nation of the lower Mississippi River Valley was one of the most influential yet lesser-known groups of 18th century New Orleans. Since French involvement in the region, interactions between the groups were frequent. Native-American and African-American relations were also common considering French and subsequent Spanish law was more lenient than English law.
One of the most evident outcomes of that unique cultural diffusion was the appropriation of toli, a popular Choctaw sport that resembles modern-day lacrosse. African-Americans dubbed it raquette, French for racket, since the game consisted of rackets. Raquette was the first recorded sport to be played and organized in New Orleans, and the earliest known games were appropriately held around Congo Square, a place already used for intercultural trading.
Various teams formed throughout the area. Lower class whites appropriated the sport and formed teams to compete. Rivals eventually emerged between two of the better teams: the “Bayous” and “La Villes”. The Bayous consisted of African-Americans and Choctaws from the rural outskirts of New Orleans, mainly from the Bayou St. John area. La Villes consisted of African-Americans from New Orleans proper (Ville is the French word for city). Although lower class whites and Creoles formed their own teams, these two rival occupied the field by Congo Square on Sundays and the fans' attention
Raquette was played with a massive field. George Washington Cable visited these matches and noted, “There was a wide room for much field sport.” According to Dale A. Somers, author of The Rise of Sports in New Orleans: 1850-1900:
Raquette was played on a field varying in length two hundred yards to a half mile. Two poles, across which canvas or paper was stretched, were set at each end of the field as goals. Each player carried a spoon-shaped raquette, eighteen to twenty inches long, with which they threw or carried a leather ball, two inches in diameter, in a frantic effort to hit the opponent's goal. There were no rules to limit team sizes, and often more than eighty youths played on each side. Under such conditions raquette amounted to little more than organized mayhem; scoreless draws, highlighted by many bruises, were common when the Bayous and LaVilles clashed. (p. 71)
The sheer number of players and viewers dramatically increased as the population of the City increased. The main raquette field was moved to a more spacious area and named “La Plaine Raquette” or “La Marigny Green”. The field was bounded between Galvez Street and North Claiborne and St. Bernard Ave and Elysian Fields in the Seventh Ward are located today. Black New Orleanians played throughout the region, with fields extending to the Algiers across the river.
In 1859, the city attempted to organize white participation and segregate the sport, but the established multicultural and multiracial games still drew the most spectators. The games were often reported on by local newspapers. On April 13, 1868, the Daily Picayune reported:
“The match game of raquette between 25 Indians and 25 Creoles, played at the Fair Grounds yesterday, was witnessed by a large number of persons. They were all dressed in costume, and appeared to splendid advantage. The Indians were victorious in decidedly the most spirited contest it has ever been our fortune to see, the score of the game being 12 to 2.”
On June 15, 1879, The Daily Picayune reported on an intense rival game:
The Pioneer Green yesterday was alive with people who came to witness the second of a series of games for the raquette championship flag between La Ville and Bayou Clubs. Each club numbered 59 players. The La Villa men were under the captainship of Henry Beineche, and the Bayous were led by L. Lange. The umpire, Capt. MacElroy, started the game at exactly 5 o'clock. Both sides immediately settled down to hard work. The brave blue shirted city men scored two. After much hard work the Bayous scored their first and only time. The game was limited to two hours, and the end was fast approaching. The La Villes did their utmost to prevent the Bayous tieing [sic], and the latter worked hard to avoid defeat.
The game was decided by the Captain of La Villes striking their base and winning the match for their club by a score of 3 to 1. This makes one game for each of the clubs. The third and last game will be played on Tuesday evening, and both sides will make a desperate fight.
Pioneer Green was located on Ursulines street, bounded by Salcedo and Dupre streets. It became a spot for the best Creole raquette players, often hosting rivalry matches. Family loyalty to the teams was strong, as sons would play on the team of their fathers.
Visitors to New Orleans were also known to frequent these matches. During a hot summer in 1901, Steward Culin witnessed a game as they were researching Native American games for the Smithsonian Institute:
The players, some hundreds of French-speaking negroes, had assembled in a level, unenclosed field. The majority were armed with rackets, each consisting of a piece of hickory bent over at one end to form a spoon, which was netted with a throng, precisely like those used by the Choctaw. A racket was carried in each hand, and the ball was picked up and thrown with them in the same way as in the Indian game. The players appear to own their own rackets, and I purchased a pair without difficulty…
The goals or bases were two tall poles about 600 feet apart, having a strip of tin, about a foot wide and 10 feet long, fastened on the inner side some distance above the ground. These goals, called plats, were painted, one red with a small double ring of white near the top, the other blue with a black ring. Midway in a straight line between was a small peg to mark the center of the field, where the ball was first thrown… The game appeared to be open, free for all, without reference to number; but in more formal matches the sides are equalized and regulated. The ball was put in play at the center flag, being tossed high in the air, and caught on the uplifted ball sticks. Then there was a wild rush across the field, the object being to secure and carry the ball and toss it against the tin plate, making a plat. The game was play with much vigor and no little violence. A blow across the shins with a racket is permissible, and broken heads are not uncommon. Play usually continues until dark, and, at the close, the winners sing Creole songs, reminding one of the custom at the close of the Choctaw game.
Local author and journalist Henry C. Castellanos wrote about the social climate surrounding the matches. “The running, wrestling and dexterity of the players were not only very exciting spectacles, but the eager crowd of spectators and acquaintances, running into the thousands… made such occasions a source of social entertainment.” Booths sold “sweet beer” and “ice cream”. Gambling was common. The victors paraded into the city “singing in mockery of the losing party”.
Despite games played into the 20th century, raquette was on the decline by the 1890s. In May of 1897, The Daily Picayune published “When Raquette Was A Popular Play,” a column that detailed its origin and history throughout the 19th century. According to the article, the game “was preeminently the popular game in this locality for nearly a century, until a few years ago, when it was partly abandoned, with the exception of a game now and then…”
The reasons for the decline are uncertain, but one can speculate. Certainly the rise of American sports permeated New Orleans as the city underwent waves of Americanization. Local newspapers began covering “baseball” by the early 1860s, and it quickly became popular. The New Orleans Pelicans, a local baseball team, became the city's first professional team in 1887, and won three championships in 1887, 1889, and 1896. Baseball was also profitable on a national scale. Perhaps the notion that the local multicultural sport attracted poor whites, African-Americans, and Native Americans caused a lack of investment by the wealthy in a segregated New Orleans.
Overall, language, culture, and other aspects of Creole life dwindled in 20th century New Orleans. Native American influence also whined as the shrinking presence of Choctaws was relegated to the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Toli and similar variations are still played among Native Americans throughout the United States, and the University of Georgia even has a toli team. The origins of lacrosse can be traced from toli and similar games.
Inevitably, Jim Crow laws and an increasingly segregated city may have caused strife between blacks and whites continuing interracial matches. As the 1897 article in The Daily Picayune states, “This is a reminiscence of the ‘good old days' when domestic harmony was all that could be desired, and when blacks and whites were so happy and contented in playing, or in witnessing, the noble game of raquette.” A few decades later the game seemed completely irrelevant. WPA writers in the 1930s concluded people became too “soft” for the game in their Guide to New Orleans.

Some Bay State emergency room doctors are seeing a growing number of daily marijuana users with an obscure syndrome characterized by screaming, violent retching and abdominal pain, symptoms that can be alleviated with medication but that usually return unless the patients stop using pot.
“When medical marijuana was decriminalized, we started seeing cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome,” said Dr. Matthew Mostofi, associate chief of emergency medicine at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, referring to the technical name for a syndrome that results in what ER docs call “scromiting,” simultaneous screaming and vomiting.
“We've seen it at least weekly the last couple of years. And it does concern me,” Mostofi said. “It's one of the downsides to the legalization of marijuana.”
Massachusetts voted to decriminalize medical marijuana in 2012 and recreational cannabis last November. But people with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome are not occasional pot users, Mostofi said.
“We're talking about people who use it two, three, four times a day — every day — over a period of months or years,” they said.
Dr. Mark Neavyn, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, said their department has seen only five to 10 cases in the last year or two. But if recreational use of marijuana becomes more common, that could change, Neavyn said.
“If you expose a population to something, there will be more people at risk of developing a substance use disorder,” they said. “And if we saw a lot more cases, it would burden emergency departments.”
The syndrome tends to result in multiple hospital visits, partly because it often goes undiagnosed by doctors who don't know it exists.
“This is a syndrome we're just now beginning to understand,” said Dr. Aimee Moulin, an ER doc who sees about one person every other shift at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, Calif.
Anti-nausea medications such as Zofran typically don't work, Moulin said, so doctors often use an anti-psychotic such as Haldol because it reduces nausea while also addressing the underlying causes of the syndrome.
“If you really want this illness to go away, though, what you need to do is stop using marijuana,” Moulin said. “And that can be such a loaded conversation because patients sometimes don't want to talk about their marijuana use. … People aren't fully aware of the potential side effects and consequences.”
Both medical and recreational marijuana are legal in California. And Moulin expects the number of patients they see with the syndrome to increase once commercial sales begin there next month.
Jim Borghesani of the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project, called cases of the illness “quite rare” and questioned if any increased reports of it could be due to better reporting in the era of legalized pot.
“We thought it's something to be concerned about, and we think that safe, tested marijuana would help,” Borghesani said. “And further funding for education that will be generated from taxes will be helpful in situations like this.”
Little data exists on the syndrome. One study tried to determine if cases of cyclic vomiting, including through cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, increased after Colorado legalized medical marijuana in 2009. But the study wasn't conclusive, noting that while cases of cyclic vomiting nearly doubled and patients were more likely to acknowledge using marijuana, it wasn't clear whether that was secondary to increased use, more accurate reporting on weed or both.
What ails smokers…
Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS), or what is being called “scromiting,” is caused by heavy pot smoking where the user suddenly screams while vomiting. Here's what is known:
SIGNS OF ILLNESS
Nausea and violent vomiting
Abdominal pain
Dehydration
Relief sought via frequent hot bathing
HISTORY
CHS was first described in 2004
Patients are typically young adults with a long history of pot use
Users who became ill smoked pot three to five times per day
LENGTH OF ILLNESS
Typically 24–48 hours, but the risk for relapse is high
CURE?
There is no cure other than to quit smoking pot

The leader of the United Kingdom's Labour Party on Saturday said former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro will be remembered as a “champion of social justice.”

“Fidel Castro's death marks the passing of a huge figure of modern history, national independence and 20th century socialism,” Jeremy Corbyn said in a statement marking Castro's death.
"From building a world class health and education system, to Cuba's record of international solidarity abroad, Castro's achievements were many,” Corbyn added.
“For all their flaws, Castro's support for Angola played a crucial role in bringing an end to Apartheid in South Africa and they will be remembered both as an internationalist and a champion of social justice.”
Raul Castro made a brief appearance on state TV late Friday night to announce their brother's death
The former communist leader's heath had been failing for several years, and their brother took control of the government in 2008.
Fidel Castro led the Cuban Revolution, taking power in 1959.
Human rights groups were harshly critical of Castro's treatment of Cuban citizens.
“Over the past forty years, Cuba has developed a highly effective machinery of repression. The denial of basic civil and political rights is written into Cuban law,” Human Rights Watch said in a 1999 report
“Cuba has always used the excuse of the U.S. embargo and restrictions to crack down on dissidents,” a top Amnesty International official said in 2014.
Castro was accused of putting citizens to death extrajudicially, imprisoning political opponents in forced labor camps and censoring dissent.
Washington is using its fight against the notorious Islamic State as a smokescreen to deal a lethal blow to Syria and its democratically elected leader President Bashar al-Assad, Western experts say.
Ignoring Bashar al-Assad's overwhelming public support in Syria, Washington and its Middle Eastern Sunni allies are doing whatever it takes to topple the country's secular leader. Now Syria is facing the risk of being dragged into further destruction: as America's President Barack Obama has recently approved US air support for Turkey's no-fly zone over Syria.
"It is late July 2015, and the media is abuzz with the news that Turkey will allow US jets to use its bases to bomb Islamic State [ISIL] targets in Syria. There is much talk about how this development is a "game-changer," and how this is a clear escalation of the much ballyhooed, but more fictional than real, US war on ISIS [ISIL]: the terror organization that US intelligence welcomed as a positive development in 2012 in their continued attempts to instigate regime change against the Syrian government led by Bashar al-Assad," US political analyst and StopImperialism.com editor Eric Draitser pointed out.

Experts stress that "this is exactly how events developed in Libya." US writer and activist Shamus Cooke recently branded the no-fly zone an 'Anti Kurdish and anti-Syrian government safe zone.' The activist pointed to the fact that in 2011, with Libya engulfed in internal strife, a "no-fly zone" quickly snowballed into US-backed regime change and the murder of Libya's president Muammar Gaddafi.
"Obama upped the stakes a year ago by authorizing the bombing of Syrian infrastructure targets, a bandit diktat without Security Council or congressional authorization — on the phony pretext of fighting IS [ISIL]. Now in collaboration with Turkey, plans are to establish (illegal) buffer and no-fly zones in northern Syria bordering southeastern Turkey," Chicago-based US writer and syndicated columnist Stephen Lendman said.
Lendman emphasized that Washington's anti-Assad plot is entirely based on false premises. While the US is spreading lies that al-Assad's army attacked peaceful civilians, facts on the ground indicate that the Syrian Army is the only shield to protect Syrians against the so-called "relatively moderate" Islamists sponsored and trained by Washington.
"Blaming victims is longstanding US policy. Washington, rogue NATO partners, Israel and other regional allies bear full responsibility for nearly four-and-a-half years of conflict in Syria," the columnist writes.
Western experts express doubts over the US-led coalition's "firm intention" to eradicate the ruthless Islamic State.
"In reality the latest pretext, ISIS [ISIL], was created and to this day perpetuated by US, Saudi, Israeli, Jordanian, and Turkish support. ISIS [ISIL] is incapable of sourcing the weapons, cash, and fighters within Syria and Iraq alone, and admittedly receives the vast majority of all three from abroad," Bangkok-based geopolitical researcher Tony Cartalucci pointed out.

"Were Turkey serious about ending the ISIS [ISIL] menace, its first order of business should be to stop harboring their fighters in their territory," Cartalucci noted, adding that Turkey has long become "the virtual port-of-call for all fighters from across the world" seeking to join the Islamic State.
There are no "moderate" rebels in Syria, most of them are Islamist insurgents, including al-Nusra Front, the infamous affiliate of Al-Qaeda, experts stress.
Embarrassingly, the Turkish Intelligence agency (MIT) has long been an active player in arming and resupplying terror groups such as al-Nusra, Draitser noted, referring to the Turkish daily Cumhuriyet that released video evidence confirming this disturbing fact.
"The question remains: will Syria survive? The answer depends on the continued resolve of the Syrian Arab Army and its allies, and on the global Resistance's capacity to organize itself to effectively oppose the Empire in Syria and beyond," Draitser concluded.
With Cliff Young, President Ipsos
Don't believe the hype. Popular narrative right now has the Democrats “zero for four” when it comes to elections, with much accompanying angst about the state of affairs in the party. But as always, we encourage armchair pundits to remain grounded in the numbers and the bigger picture, and remember that individual isolated elections are not leading indicators of, well, anything!
A data-driven approach to election prediction takes into account the structural context of an election scenario, and the primary explanatory factors for the 2018 midterm elections are purely structural in nature. Our analysis allows us to look towards 2018 with clearer eyes.
If the 2018 midterm elections were held today, the Republicans would lose control of the House by about seven seats. But they shouldn't necessarily blame Trump: the reasons are almost entirely out of their hands. There is a ‘rhythm' to politics and control of the House of Representatives; this is something we can explore using a 5-variable regression model to forecast House seats. This model was tested with data from all midterm congressional elections from 1946 to 2006, a total of 17 data points. The specific model inputs include:
1. Presidential approval ratings, taken from Gallup [LINK] from 1946 to 1990 and from multiple poll averages thereafter
2. The number of Republican seats in the previous congress, a lagged variable
3. The difference in poll data on the “Generic Congressional Ballot” question (Republican share minus Democrat share) [LINK]
4. The party of the sitting president
5. The difference in House seats (Republican minus Democrat) as the dependent variable
Our House model, which has a high predictive value, suggests an estimated 27-seat gain by Democrats, translating into a net 7-seat Democrat advantage.
Our model shows that the two strongest drivers are the Generic Congressional Ballot polling and the party of the president. The fact that the president is a Republican speaks to the “structural” nature of the rhythm of House control. The party newly in control of the White House is in some ways automatically disadvantaged at the next midterm election. Any Republican ― not just President Trump ― would notably increase the Republicans' chances of losing the House. We would add that the debate over healthcare is also hurting Republicans right now. Healthcare is an issue on which Democrats are typically seen as stronger, and the political chaos around ACA / AHCA will naturally hurt Republicans more than Democrats.
There are some notable caveats that may apply here. First, Democratic advantage may be underestimated due to gerrymandering, which has traditionally helped Republicans. Second, this estimate is based on the present moment, including Trump's current approval ratings [LINK] and data on today's Generic Congressional Ballot [LINK].
That said, the highly predictive value of this model paired with the immutability of key variables (number of seats and President's party) suggest that this prediction is a solid one. It is certainly not outside the realm of possibility that Trump's ratings will remain as low as they currently are. Indeed, they have not improved significantly from the earliest ratings [LINK] taken of them prior to their election as President. Despite Trump's lack of support, this model does not factor in the President as an individual, so even a change in the President themselves (due to impeachment or any other cause) would not change some of the key model inputs.

We have tried hard with all our TBS games to test and try different aspects on turn-based gaming. We are not set on a single formula of how mechanics work, and I think thats a strength we can carry into a bigger title like JAF. For one we practically have a lot of code for different mechanics already in place, and at the same time we can bring fresh eyes to JAF that are not set in stone. And even with that experience, we decided to go for “JA2 with a new story”. It simply felt like the only real path to go for the game – especially with Back in Action having tried to fiddle with “the core”.
Dylan: One of the things about Full Control that I relate to in a very personal way is your mission statement – “Our mission is to deliver new strategy games for the ‘soccer dad' group.” After all, we game responsibly around here. What do you think needs to be done differently when targeting this specific niche of the market?
I think that the essence of our mission statement is “turn based”. No matter how small or how big, how easy or how hard – turn based is simply the perfect foundation for “soccer dads” of all ages. You can play the amount of time you have – and stop at a moment notice when real life calls upon you. And then continue your game later without having missed a heartbeat in your game experience.
Try that with endless runners or first-person shooters – just not possible.
Dylan: Javier O' Neill credits Spec Ops: The Line as one of their many previous projects. Will they aim to inject some of the gritty realism that is making Spec Ops a cult favorite among mature gamers?
Javier's broad experience sets the theme not only for their art but the entire art department. Just take a look at the fantastic environment for Space Hulk that the team has made under their leadership. This will naturally carry over into JAF!
Dylan: Your concept artist, Jesper worked with Crytek on the first two installments of the Crysis series. How will their experience creating concepts for futuristic military technology factor into Jagged Alliance: Flashback?
Jesper is super talented and a great artist in general. Having been able to draw concepts on AAA level for many years gives us a huge quality lift on the concept production for JAF and a lot of great ideas on the art side.
Dylan: I'd assume your feeling a bit like Christoper Nolan or Zack Snyder when approaching Jagged Alliance. It's a tall task to take a known IP, modernize it and add real value to the reset. A successful outing requires additions and subtractions to the original formula. In what area of the game play are you treading carefully to ensure Jagged Alliance retains it's identity?
Yeah – we have approached this IP as one of the holy grails, and that means we want to change as little as possible. Especially the combat system and tactical layer is what most fans love, and we have a “if its not broken, don't fix it” approach to that part. To help us on this part, we have gotten Chris Camfield onto the team as advisor – to point us to places in JA2 that they felt broken or in need of fixes when they coded them.
For me personally JA has always been about the story and the mercs in addition to the tactical part. So we need cheesy humor, mercs with personality and through them an emergent behaviour of your squads as if they are actual characters. Perverted characters, but they have a life 🙂
The place where we think we can bring something to the table in terms of additions is really on the strategic layer. More options, different factions, hints of politics, base building/fortification
Dylan: The team has an obvious passion for tactical TBS. What game from your childhood molded your love for the genre?
Jagged Alliance has been one of the 3 games I really admired and played a lot in the “old days”. XCom and Fallout being the others, as well as all the AD&D games by SSI. Warhammer 40k Chaos Gate as well. All games in the same genre with different aspects to bring to the table.
So being able to start creating games that pick up on these classics is just fantastic! I would not want to do any other job than this right now.
Dylan: In your opinion, what makes the TBS genre so appealing? Why do you think it's making a mainstream comeback in the past few years? (example Xcom: Enemy Unknown)
TBS has always had lots of things going for it. You are first and foremost able to think before pressing buttons. Action games definitely are fun to play, but they dont really tell a story the way a good TBS RPG can do it.
At the same time they were ugly beasts mostly marred with horrible UI and 500-page manuals to read. And even then people have been playing them all the time, because they simply emerge you into the games on a different level.
The recent year has changed a lot – with XCOM:EU really only opening the eyes for a broader public (as well as publishers) that people have really wanted to play these games. But no one was making them any more except few hardcore studios.
I really think Firaxis did a fantastic job on XCOM:EU. They didnt just copy the old game, but destilled it down to the essense for a more broad audience. They put TBS on the radar for regular gamers and showed them that these games can be pretty, have action and user interfaces that are not just ugly grey buttons.
We didnt go down that route with JAF for many reasons, but that doesnt mean that I could not see us or someone else does a similar game in the Jagged Alliance universe. But thats not JAF. Here we go with a Kickstarter to cater to the old school fans.
The last things I think has an influence is a combination of tablets being perfect for TBS as well and the entire digital distribution boom. This has lead to the resurgence of more niche audience titles and grown the awareness of old popular genres.
Dylan: Full Control is fully supporting the PC modding community with JAF. Why is it so important in today's PC gaming climate to offer mod kits to the community?
We think that modding extends the lifetime of a PC game way beyond the original intends. It has several positive effects – fan communities as well as additional sales on the tail. So win win.
Dylan: JAF will focus on taking and holding strategic points, squad and base building mechanics as well as stealth. With that in mind, are there going to be any dedicated stealth missions? Maybe collecting information to make an area easier to capture?
We definitely want to have more stealth being a big part of the game. If that means dedicated stealth missions or not has not been decided yet. But collecting information via different means definitely is one of the things we are looking at. And some of that could definitely be tied into missions where its a matter of sneaking in more than “just” killing all enemies in a sector.
Dylan: Considering JAF will take place during the cold war, will there be a heavy focus on espionage?
Not as its planned now. The setting was chosen primarily to tell the prequel story with AIM being founded in 1991, and the 80'ies and the cold war is simply so rich in cool stories that it made the choice easy.
Q: In your opinion, what impact has crowdfunding had on the gaming industry?
It has given gamers a way to “vote” on what type of games they really want – not what publishers read into marketing data.
It has given developers a chance to get money for alternative ideas on different levels – from the one-man army home in their moms basement to larger independent studios to make their dream games.
At the same time It's important to say, that its not “the” answer to all problems. The amount of pledgers is extremely low compared to gamers who buy games. And there is still room for other ways to finance games that dont fit into the Kickstarter mold.
Dylan: What feature are you most excited about adding to JAF?
Compared to recent games in the Jagged Alliance IP, we are super excited to get turn-based combat back again as well as mercenary personalities.
I look at it more broad, then the ability to add a new chapter to the Jagged Alliance story universe. In our opinion JA is as much an RPG as a TBS, and to what you need both a great story AND great tactical combat.
Dylan: The goal with JAF is to “reset” the series. Explain the inherent difference between a reboot and a reset.
The recent reboot used in Back in Action tried to take the Jagged Alliance name and put it into a direction where someone thought that it would reach a bigger audience – removing in the process a lot of the soul and the DNA of what Jagged Alliance was about.
Our reset will take the game back to the roots again – removing this “reboot” from the equation. We dont want to rework mechanics that fans love. But we want to tell a new story while staying true to Jagged Alliance. At the same time we can modernise the game into a 3D engine, and hopefully gives modders a new base to build future games upon.
It's obvious that Thomas and Full Control are well aware of the weight pressing upon their shoulders. Long time fans of the Jagged Alliance series will have lofty expectations in regards to Flashback. The Danish development teams' past Turn Based Strategy experience and true respect of the Jagged Alliance franchise should inspire confidence in potential backers of JAF. Be sure to check out Full Control's latest project updates and help make this reset a reality. Make sure to visit their Kickstarter page for more information.

All the photos were shot on a single roll of Fuji Neopan Acros 100 film using vintage camera equipment. I developed the film at home myself. You are seeing every photo that was captured - there were none omitted. Unfortunately, many of the photos were damaged from light leaks, which was very frustrating. I have no idea what caused them. I've done my best to repair them in post, but if some of the photos look a little off, that's why.

Welcome to the conclusion of my 8 examples of exceptional art in comics. Continuing in the same vein as Part 1, this is a list of 4 more comics that succeed in providing a distinctive mix of originality and excellence in their illustrations.
With this list I have tried to keep a steady balance of both popular and underrated books. Now obviously, with only eight examples, I cannot help but leave out many noteworthy mentions that have more than earned their right for attention. These are not the absolute eight best drawn books ever published; they are simply a collection of beautiful comics that help showcase the talent behind the medium. For every comic listed here there are hundreds more, all equally worth a recommendation—behind them, dozens of unique artists that deserve acclaim. The comics industry has provided a wealth of impressively rendered titles over its lifetime—these are only a few notable examples.
5. Batwoman: Elegy
Elegy was a 6-issue story arc featured in DC's long-running Detective Comics title. The story took place between issues 854-860, and featured the return of the long-shelved DC character, Batwoman. Though first featured in DC's year-long 52 comic title, Kate Kane truly got their first big break during this Greg Rucka written arc. The character benefitted greatly from having such an experienced writer behind the helm, and the story has since earned almost universal acclaim from both fans and critics. But the greatest boon to Batwoman's return was unquestionably the brilliant art from, the one and only, J.H. Williams III.
Williams has long been praised for their masterful illustrations in the realm of comics. They have partnered with big name writers such as Alan Moore, Warren Ellis, and Grant Morrison on some of their most influential works. Their art always proven a compliment to any book that housed it; however, no previous comic had ever been granted as stunning a treatment as Batwoman was.
Williams' illustration on Elegy can be summed up in one word—revolutionary. This was a comic that forewent any semblance of subtly; it had amazing artwork, and it made damn sure you noticed. These brazen visuals were furthered still by Dave Stewart's bold colours, which helped to emphasise Williams' style with their pronounced contrasts of red, white, and black. The comic approached superhero in an entirely new fashion by applying and accentuating Batman's innate gothic trappings to its style in a way that results in something entirely new and individual. Williams' greatest contribution to the abberant look of this arc is provided in the form of their ingenious compositions, which effectively highlight the returned hero with their own distinct art nouveau trademark that has since become a staple of DC's New 52 relaunched Batwoman title.
J.H. Williams' Batwoman art belongs on a centre pedestal in a museum—it's the apotheosis of comic illustration.

6. Elektra: Assassin
The second Elektra title to make this list, Assassin was a limited Marvel series published in the late 80's. The comic was written by none other than Frank Miller himself, and presented the famed anti-hero in a struggle to stop nuclear war using all of the ninja skills at their disposal. It was a surprisingly political book in comparison with Miller's previous works at the time. The story centred heavily around political intrigue and corruption; focusing heavily on the cold war tensions of the era. The comic tackled some pretty mature subject matter and was thus restricted in its original release. This is a shame because it stands to date as one of Miller's greatest works, in my honest opinion. But this comic's greatness wasn't solely the product of the Frank Miller's excellent writing—in fact, Miller's writing could be argued as being only the secondary draw of Elektra: Assassin. The primary reason I still hold this book so fondly is the gorgeous original artwork of Bill Sienkiewicz.
Sienkiewicz is not an unknown name in the industry; they are an Eisner award-winning artist whose beautiful works can be found throughout the medium. Their art has always avoided much of the commonalities shared by other comic illustrations; opting instead for a more unique approach. I could easily recommend any of their works under the theme of this list, but I have chosen Elektra because of the distinct power that the artwork holds in the development of the story.
Assassin is special because it effectively showcases how illustration can dramatically affect writing. Sienkiewicz's abstract and unorthodox imagery has a definite effect on Miller's style, and the story ends up mirroring much of the illustration in its approach. Once again we are given an Elektra title that throws all convention out the proverbial window. Neither Miller's controversial content, nor Sienkiewicz's stylised art are bound in any rules of the time. The visuals take whatever form they need to convey the story, and the story works to not overtly anchor the illustration. What results is a comic worth remembering.

7. Siegfried
Here is a book that I don't expect to draw much recognition. Siegfried is a French comic, originally published in 2007. The title was the product of writer, artist, and French native, Alex Alice. Siegfried achieved critical acclaim in its original release in 2007, and continued to garner local support throughout its 3 album run, which finished in late 2011. Though not originally available in English, the comic's beautiful artwork translated easily for foreign readers, who created a noticeable demand for a localisation. This demand was met by American publisher, Archaia Entertainment; the first book of Alice's trilogy was released earlier this year, preceded by a fully animated video trailer (linked below.) The other two entries are also set for a near-future release, and an animated movie is in the works back in France.
Siegfried is a visual retelling of Richard Wagner's epic opera, the Ring of the Nibelung. It is a story centring on a boy's desire to find their parents, and the realisation of the epic destiny fate has decided for him. It presents many of the fantastical themes of the Norse mythologies; including gods, dwarves, and dragons among its cast of mythic characters. Siegfried is a captivating tale that transports the reader to a land of heroes and legends; it is a superbly successful modernisation of the epics of the long past. Alice's story is well worth the wait, but their art can be enjoyed immediately.
Alice does not stray as far from the traditional styling of the medium as the other entries on this list. Their lineart is distinct, and reinforced by bold inking; colours work to support the illustration rather than lead it, and characters are exaggerated in style—make no mistake though, Siegfried is unquestionably unique. The art may seem conventional at first glance, but that impression proves quickly false; Siegfried does not simply utilise the comic style, it perfects it. The whole comic is positively breathtaking in its imagery; every page serves to convey the story perfectly. The meticulously detailed illustrations never let up, and the reader is successfully invested in the world the whole way through. The supporting colours emphasise the various set pieces fittingly, and manage to further accentuate dimensions of the story.
Siegfried is an amazing book that does not even require a full translation to enjoy—the art alone is more than enough to tell the story and justify a read.

8. Shazam! the Power of Hope
I have to confess, I've never considered myself a true fan of DC's Captain Marvel. The character always felt like something of a cheap Superman substitute; an overly exaggerated hero, so stereotypical that they almost came across as satirical. I just could never shake that forced goody-two-shoes stigma; reminiscent of the false ideals of a bygone era. And so the Captain's recorded adventures often went ignored by me as some sort of silent personal protest against a falsity I perceived them as representing. It was Alex Ross and Paul Dini who finally managed to draw me under the influence of Shazam! with their DC hero collection, the World's Greatest Super-Heroes.
The Power of Hope was released as Captain Marvel's contribution to Dini and Ross' memorable series. It focuses on adolescent hero Billy Batson's duty as a beacon of hope for all those less fortunate. The story starts off predictably, with Batson forced to cancel their baseball plans in order to go care for sick children; all the while teaching them the meaning of good, and hope, and stuff. This comic comes equipped with all it needs to succeed as nothing more than another sickly sweet lesson of truth, justice, and all that other junk that makes up the fabled moral fibre of society. Luckily, it also has something else—a fantastic creative team.
Shazam! the Power of Hope knows what it is; the book intentionally embraces the tropes of its past. Dini writes a story that, while cheesy, never comes across as totally disingenuous. It works to chip away at the cynical shell of its reader; desperately trying to flame any dwindling spark of optimism that may be buried under layers of harsh, accumulated pessimism. While it might not wholly succeed in convincing every reader; it does try its damndest. Dini's story packs some real emotion behind the overt themes. However, it is Ross' artwork that makes this book in the end.
Alex Ross has long been held as one the masters of the comic art world. Their paintings have always managed to capture a distinct spark in the characters they illustrate. Their photorealistic painting style has fluctuated only slightly during their twenty year-long career, and has since become widely recognisable. Though any of their stunning works could easily be included on this list, the Power of Hope comes to mind as the book I most want to mention. It's corny, it's sappy, but most of all it's beautiful.
And really, I don't think we need yet another Kingdom Come recommendation… Unless of course you haven't read Kingdom Come; in which case, go do that. Seriously.

Story highlights Rice acknowledges the failure of previous administrations to rein in North Korea's nuclear program
They say a pre-emptive strike would be foolish and catastrophic
Washington (CNN) Former national security adviser Susan Rice said Thursday the United States should rule out a pre-emptive strike on North Korea, casting President Donald Trump's "fire and fury" comments as dangerous.
"A pre-emptive war, if one were actually thinking of executing that, would be catastrophic," Rice said on CNN's "Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."
They said the "hot rhetoric" coming from both Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un could move the nations closer to war.
Rice, who was US ambassador to the United Nations under President Barack Obama before becoming their top national security aide, said the United States should instead continue to rely on deterrence, the threat of a swift and massive military response should North Korea move to attack the United States or its allies, as a way to dissuade North Korea from attacking.
They said the President had articulated the logic of deterrence in their comments earlier Thursday.
Ashley Frangipane went to the top of the charts with their second album 'Hopeless Fountain Kingdom'
Halsey has spoken about their reaction to being the first female artist to go to Number One in the US charts in 2017.
The singer, whose real name is Ashley Frangipane, released their second album ‘Hopeless Fountain Kingdom‘ on June 2 and went straight to the top of the charts in America.
“Everyone thought I would be excited,” they told NME of the achievement. “And I was, but I think there are so many women who've put out better albums than me that deserve that. So all we can do is keep shining a light on the female artists that we love and give them the exposure they deserve.”
They also pointed out that since their record went to Number One, there have been three back-to-back chart-toppers for female artists. “I think the hard thing is it wasn't just men constantly dethroning women,” they said. “The big male players put out records this year. You've got Kendrick Lamar, Drake, The Chainsmokers, Ed Sheeran – the biggest male artists in the game.
“So I think it was hard for any newcomers to fight through. The positive thing to come through is I had the Number One record, Katy [Perry] had a Number One record, now Lorde is having a Number One record, so it's back-to-back-to-back women. I know Lana [Del Rey] is set to release this summer, I'm sure Miley's going to be putting out something as well. Also, SZA had their moment in the US as well, which is incredible. I think this summer women are going to take charge again.”
Halsey made their first appearance at Glastonbury earlier this afternoon, performing on the Other Stage. After ‘Heaven In Hiding', they told the crowd: “You grow up in the States knowing about the legend of Glastonbury like you know about the legend of Woodstock. It's a crazy, mystery place you'll never get to go to if you're just a kid living in America – certainly not one you'll get to perform at.

“That was a very far-fetched dream for a girl from across the pond,” they added, before playing ‘Eyes Closed', their collaboration with The Weeknd.
Glastonbury 2017 continues with a headline set from Radiohead this evening. Foo Fighters and Ed Sheeran will headline the final two days, while the likes of The xx, Phoenix, Warpaint and Boy Better Know will also appear.
More than two dozen other colleges and universities around the country have rescinded the actor-comedian's honorary degrees or are considering doing so in the wake of allegations that they drugged and molested dozens of women.
STORRS, Conn. — The University of Connecticut on Wednesday revoked an honorary degree awarded to Bill Cosby, saying they engaged in conduct "incongruent" with the university's values.
Trustees voted unanimously to rescind the Doctor of Fine Arts given to Cosby in 1996. Officials said it was the first time UConn has revoked an honorary degree.
Cosby spokesperson Andrew Wyatt declined to comment.
The 78-year-old Cosby faces allegations that they drugged and molested dozens of women over five decades.  They are charged criminally in connection with allegations by one woman in Pennsylvania and faces lawsuits by others in states including Massachusetts, where they and their wife of more than a half-century have a home in Shelburne Falls. Cosby has denied the allegations.
More than two dozen other colleges and universities around the country have rescinded the entertainer's honorary degrees or are considering doing so.
The resolution approved by UConn cites Cosby's admissions in lawsuit depositions. In one deposition, Cosby admitted they had affairs with young models and actores and they obtained quaaludes to give to women they wanted to have sex with.
"The University respects the principles of due process and Mr. Cosby's right to a fair and public trial on the criminal charges against him," the resolution says. "But the conduct which they admitted in their sworn testimony provides compelling reasons for the University of Connecticut to consider the revocation of their honorary degree.
"This is an extraordinary action that is not being taken lightly," the resolution says.
The Undergraduate Student Government at UConn asked trustees in March to revoke Cosby's degree.
UConn officials said the university and other higher education institutions must work to prevent sexual assault and to support victims.

Shadow Brokers Emptied their Bitcoin Account
As promised to release more zero-days exploits and hacking tools for various platforms starting from June 2017, the infamous hacking group Shadow Brokers is back with more information on how to subscribe and become a private member for receiving exclusive access to the future leaks.The Shadow Brokers is the same hacking group who leaked NSA's built Windows hacking tools and zero-day exploits in public that led to the WannaCry menace When the Shadow Brokers promised its June 2017 release two weeks ago, the group announced that it would sell new zero-day exploits and hacking tools only to the private members with paid monthly subscription, instead of making them public for everyone.Now, just a few minutes ago, the hacking collective has released details about how to participate in the monthly subscription model – or the "Wine of Month Club," as the group called it – to get exclusive access to the upcoming leaks each month starting from June.So, those who are interested in buying the membership of the "wine of month club" would require to:Once done, the Shadow Brokers will send a payment confirmation email to "delivery email address" provided by all interested members.Then between 07/01/2017 and 07/17/2017, the group will send another email to all confirmed members, containing a link and their unique password for the June 2017 data dump.Launched in late October, Zcash is a new cryptocurrency currency that claims to be more anonymous than Bitcoin, as the sender, recipient, and value of transactions remain hidden. However, the group said, it doesn't even trust Zcash and Tor for absolute anonymity.The hacking collective says the membership has been kept expensive because the data dump has been intended for hackers, security companies, government, and OEMs.Although what the June dump would contain is not clear at the moment, the Shadow Brokers' last announcement claimed that the upcoming data dump would include:Keeping in mind the last disaster caused due to the leaked NSA exploits, it would not be wrong if security companies buy the June dump for $21,000 per month and secure their products before hackers get their hands on new zero-day exploits to wreak havoc across the world.The claims made by the Shadow Brokers remain unverified at the time of writing, but since its previously released dump turned out to be legitimate, the group's statement should be taken seriously, at least now, when we know the NSA's backdoors released by the group last month were used by WannaCry and other malware to cause chaos worldwide.If the announcement made by the Shadow Brokers comes out to be true, the world should be well prepared for another WannaCry-like massive destroyer Before publicly dumping the stolen NSA zero-day exploits in April, the Shadow Brokers put an auction of those cyber weapons for 1 Million Bitcoin.Although the auction did not go well , the Bitcoin address setup by the hacking collective to collect bids has received a total of 10.5 Bitcoin (around $24,000).Finally, on Monday, the Shadow Brokers emptied their Bitcoin account, moving all the Bitcoins to subsidiary Bitcoin addresses.
I took the Filco MiniLa Air Bluetooth keyboard with me on vacation this year to use with a MacBook Air propped up on the fantastic Roost stand. I use the tenkeyless Filco Majestouch at home, and I was hoping for the same super-accurate, clicky-key action in this battery-powered, portable wireless version.
And I almost got it. But for one major flaw, the MiniLa is almost as good as the desktop version. The good news is, that flaw might just be a personal quibble.
The Filco MiniLa Air Bluetooth is a full-size keyboard in a pint-size package. Most keys are the same as you'd find on a regular-size clicky keyboard, but space has been saved by shrinking the shift keys, moving the arrow keys into the main cluster and combining the top two rows, putting the function keys into the number key row, accessible by using the two special function keys on either side of the shrunken spacebar.
The keyboard isn't light (it's 680 grams) but it is built like a brick shithouse, easily able to stand up to the rigors of travel. Speaking of travel, you'll want to keep the sturdy plastic cover that protects the keys in the shipping box, because it's the only way to cover the keys when you dump the MiniLa in your bag. I combined it with a rubber band to keep it in place. It's low-tech, but almost size-less and it works perfectly well.
Another note, before we get to the typing experience, is that the MiniLa has six DIP switches on the back, which can be used to make changes to the keyboard's hardware output. You can switch those function keys to work as extensions to the spacebar, or you can switch off the Windows/App keys. Depending on the layout (U.S., Japanese or ISO), you can also do things like switch to delete and ~ keys. What you can't do is flip the Alt and Win keys to become Option and Command keys, making the MiniLa useless for iPad users who are coming from the Mac. These keys are marked on the front with Mac-friendly legends, and you can easily flip their functions in the OS X keyboard prefs, but if you want to use the MiniLa with an iOS device these keys will be in the wrong place for you.
Typing
I'll sum up the typing experience first. I'm typing the review for the Filco MiniLa Air Bluetooth on my regular, full-size Filco. When The Lady saw this, they said “Uh-oh.”
The problem is the shift keys. Both of them are tiny, the same size as all the other keys. I'm not the world's most accurate typist (just ask Lewis, who edits my posts), but even so, I found I kept making mistakes, on almost every word. Worse, like the iPad Brydge keyboard, I kept hitting the up arrow as well as the right shift key, which would highlight the previous line and then obliterate it as soon as I typed the next word. Even after a week of solid use, this didn't get any better. And you know what makes me really angry? The fricking caps lock key is full-size, and sitting right above the left shift and tilde (~) keys. Why not swap them?
Surprisingly, the thing that didn't cause a problem was the little spacebar. I didn't find the two function keys all that useful, although that might be because I'm pretty vanilla when it comes to typing – I'm a words and numbers guy, with lots of keyboard shortcuts, but not really any function key use. When I did need the function keys (for adjusting volume or brightness, for example), I had no problem getting used to it.
In summary, the MiniLa Air feels cramped. Even though the actual typing part of the keyboard is the exact same size as my regular Filco, and the keys use the same Cherry MX Blue key-switches, the fact that all the other keys are smaller and squished together makes the whole thing feel too tight.
Which is a shame, as in most respects the Filco is a fantastic keyboard. The switches and build quality are top-notch, the key action and sound are beautiful (the sound is actually slightly quieter and denser than the full-size model) and the Bluetooth connection is strong and intelligent (it sleeps and wakes at just the right times). It's just a shame I can't type on it, as it's not only a great keyboard for travel, but also looks great under an iMac on the desktop.
But like I said, maybe this is just a personal foible. If you've typed on keyboards with mini shift keys before, or if you are a very accurate typist and don't have to worry about hitting the arrow keys instead (or in tandem with) the shift key, then you should probably give this keyboard a try.
There's one more thing to consider. The Filco MiniLa Air Bluetooth goes for £100, which is only a few pounds more than the Logitech K811. Viewed like this and in comparison to loads of overpriced iPad keyboards, the MiniLa Air is a steal. If you don't mind those vestigial keys, that is.
The Star Wars character Chewbacca has been dragged before a court in Odessa, in perhaps the most surreal episode in local elections across Ukraine that have been both hotly contested and rife with dirty tricks. The man inside the costume was fined 170 hryvnia (£5) for the “administrative offence” of not being able to produce identification documents.
A statement posted on the official Instagram account of the Ukrainian police read: “Nothing unusual here, just Chewbacca detained for being without documents while driving Darth Vader to the elections in Odessa. The Sith Lord has already claimed this was illegal as Chewbacca is their pet and general servant and thus does not require documents.”
Police had earlier dragged “Chewbacca” from a polling station and put them in a van after accusing them of disrupting proceedings. The person in the costume said they had been there to support Darth Vader, who was attempting to vote.

Darth Vaders have been frequent candidates at Ukrainian elections, with a reported 16 of them taking part in last year's parliamentary vote. The Vaders, many of whom have changed their names legally, usually campaign in full costume. A statue of Vladimir Lenin was given a makeover and unveiled in a new guise as Darth Vader last week, in response to a Ukrainian law banning symbols of the Communist past.
Chewbacca's arrest was not the only controversy on election day. More significantly, the vote was cancelled in the city of Mariupol, close to the front line between pro-Ukraine forces and Russia-backed separatists. The official reason was due to spoiled ballot papers, and there are plans to reschedule the vote in a fortnight.
In other major cities, including Kiev, there will be a second round of voting for the mayor, after no candidate received more than 50% in the first round. Kiev's incumbent mayor, the former heavyweight boxer Vitaly Klitschko, is expected to win comfortably in the second round.
The elections were marked by traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals, leading many observers to claim that the new Ukrainian government has not yet managed to introduce the “new kind of politics” promised after the Maidan revolution last year.
Share
The turn of the century was an eventful time in PC graphics. DirectX solidified itself as the go-to Windows graphics API, discrete video cards for gaming became a must-have accessory, and the ranks of companies designing them slowly thinned as the best and brightest emerged victorious. Eventually, only two competitors emerged: ATI (purchased by AMD in 2006) and Nvidia.
Over the last decade these companies, often known as the red team and the green team, have been locked in a seemingly eternal conflict. Whenever one side gained an edge, the other swiftly responded. No video card remained the obvious king for more than a few months. Gamers had plenty of choice, and could always count on the constant advancement of GPU performance.
It seems the conflict has reached its end.
Nvidia has gained a lasting upper hand on AMD, and gamers have taken notice: In 2014 the former gained 11 percent market share, taken entirely from the red team. Is this really the end of the war — and if so, what will it mean for gamers?
Red team in retreat
Last year's swing in graphics card sales, found in data from Jon Peddie Research, was dramatic but not entirely unprecedented. AMD's share of the discrete graphics market started to slide several years ago and has never recovered. 2014 was the largest swing yet, but it was hardly the start of the downward momentum.
Bill Roberson/Digital Trends
Fans of AMD might argue that, in terms of all graphics chips shipped, the company still leads. That's because it packs a graphics component into its Fusion APUs. These aren't big moneymakers, though, nor are they great for gaming. And anyone that accepts that measure must then admit that the largest graphics company in the world is actually Intel, which ships integrated graphics with every processor.
JPR's data isn't the only point in favor of Nvidia. Steam's hardware survey has long shown Nvidia to be dominant, and the latest trends only reinforce that position. As of February 2015 only 28.6 percent of Steam gamers have an AMD video card, compared to 51.8 percent for Nvidia, and the red team's share has decreased from just over 32 percent two years ago.
The problem isn't entirely performance
Nvidia hardware is cooler and quieter across the board.
Such a large disparity might lead you to think that Nvidia's hardware is seriously outperforming AMD. Yet reviews indicate that's not the case. Radeon cards have remained competitive with Nvidia's lineup because AMD simply cuts prices whenever it appears a card begins to lose value. The Radeon HD 7770 and Radeon R7 260X are great for 1080p gaming and very affordable.
What's the issue, then? That's arguable, but two problems stand out. Efficiency is the first. Nvidia has pursued architecture updates aggressively and more quickly placed them in products while AMD, strapped for resources as it tries to compete in both CPU and GPU realms, has fallen back on re-branding existing chips in many of its cards.
The result of this strategy is apparent in power draw. AMD's R9 290X, a single-GPU powerhouse, has a thermal design power of 250 watts, while the quicker GeForce GTX 980 fits within a 165-watt envelope. The GTX Titan X, meanwhile needs as much power as the R9 290X but is at least 50 percent quicker in most benchmarks. That means Nvidia hardware is cooler and quieter. Gamers may be willing to put up with a card that sounds like a box fan, but most prefer peace if it's an option.
Features are the second point of difference. Nvidia has consistently rolled out new software and drivers including GeForce Experience, an easy-to-use driver update utility, and ShadowPlay game recording. The green team was also first to embrace frame synchronization with G-Sync, though AMD is catching up with its more open alternative FreeSync. There are some advantages on the red side of the fence, like a very aggressive game bundling program called “Never Settle,” but Nvidia is winning the features war.
No reversal in sight
It's not unusual for one of these two companies to gain a temporary advantage over the other. There was a time, several years ago, when it appeared AMD was the absolute price-performance victor. Yet there is reason to believe Nvidia's dominance won't end soon.
AMD's plate is full of financial junk food.
At the root, AMD's problem is everything. It's suffering across the board, losing money and important staff at a startling rate. The company's revenue in 2014 was $5.5 billion. That's a billion more than Nvidia, but the green team isn't spread as thin and doesn't compete directly with Intel. That's probably why AMD lost over $400 million in 2014, while Nvidia made over $400 million in the same period.
AMD's plate is full of financial junk food. There's a lot of it, but it provides little substance. Nvidia, meanwhile, is grazing on high-end video cards that provide a nutritious profit. The fact is that companies building cutting-edge hardware need big budgets for research and development, and AMD is struggling in that area.
Not good news for gamers
All of this is bad news for AMD, and bad news for gamers. It seems doubtful that the company will see an epic turnaround soon: the best possible outcome is probably acquisition by a larger company. That might breath new life into Radeon, but the acquiring company could just as easy ditch the desktop GPU business to focus on a trending segment, like mobile.
Nvidia
Whatever happens, Nvidia's dominance leaves gamers with less real choice. The result of that is obvious in video card prices, which have remained stagnant in recent years. And even the green team has started to release new cards with less vigor than normal, no doubt because the pressure is off. The GTX 900 desktop series, for example, arrived nearly two years after the first GTX 700 desktop card.
If trends continue, the only acceptable option for gaming on the desktop will be an Intel processor with an Nvidia video card. While such hardware will certainly do the job, the lack of competition won't help the PC platform's reputation for excessive expense, and may slow the release of affordable cards that can handle 4K gaming.
Players — even those who prefer Nvidia — should pray the red team gets back in the game.
When it comes to , never take the title of the piece at face value; or the conclusions for that matter.
In my last post, I mentioned how I find some phrases and topics act as red flags regarding the quality of research one is liable to encounter. Today, the topic is gender equality - specifically some perceived (and, indeed, some rather peculiar) against women – which is an area not renowned for its clear-thinking or reasonable conclusions. As usual, the news articles circulating this piece of research made some outlandish claim that lacks even remote face validity. In this case, the research in question concludes that people, collectively, try to figure out the gender of the people selling things on eBay so as to pay women substantially less than men for similar goods. Those who found such a conclusion agreeable to their personal biases spread it to others across social as yet another example of how the world is an evil, unfair place. So here I am again, taking a couple recreational shots at some nonsense story of sexism.
Source: Yelp/T S.
The piece question today is an article from Kricheli-Katz & Regev (2016) that examined data from about 1.1 million eBay auctions. The stated of the authors involve examining gender inequality in online product markets, so at least we can be sure they're going into this without an agenda. Kricheli-Katz & Regev (2016) open their piece by talking about how gender inequality is a big problem, launching their discussion almost immediately with a rehashing of that misleading 20% pay gap statistic that's been floating around forever. As that claim has been dissected so many times at this point, there's not much more to say about it other than (a) when controlling for important factors, it drops to single digits and (b) when you see it, it's time to buckle in for what will surely be an unpleasant ideological experience. Thankfully, the paper does not disappoint in that regard, promptly suggesting that women are discriminated against in online markets like eBay.
So let's start by considering what the authors did, and what they found. First, Kricheli-Katz & Regev (2016) present us with their analysis of eBay data. They restricted their research to auctions only, where sellers will post an item and any subsequent interaction occurs between bidders alone, rather than between bidders and sellers. On average, they found that the women had about 10 fewer months of experience than men, though the accounts of both sexes had existed for over nine years of age, and women also had very-slightly better reputations, as measured by customer feedback. Women also tended to set slightly higher initial prices than men for their auctions, controlling for the product being sold. As such, women also tended to receive slightly fewer bids on their items, and ultimately less money per sale when they ended.
However, when the interaction between and product type (new or used) was examined, the headline-grabbing result appeared: while women netted a mere 3% less on average for used products than men, they netted a more-impressive 20% less for new products (where, naturally, one expects products to be the same). Kricheli-Katz & Regev (2016) claim that the discrepancy in the new-product case are due to beliefs about gender. Whatever these unspecified beliefs are, they cause people to pay women about 20% less for the same item. Taking that idea on face value for a moment, why does that gap all but evaporate in the used category of sales? The authors attribute that lack of a real difference to an increased trust people have in women's descriptions of the condition of their products. So men trust women more when it comes to used goods, but pay them less for new ones when trust is less relevant. Both these conclusions, as far as I can see from the paper, have been pulled directly out of thin air. There is literally no evidence presented to support them: no data; not citations; no anything.

By this point, anyone familiar with how eBay works is likely a bit confused. After all, the sex of the seller is at no point readily apparent in almost any listings. Without that crucial piece of information, people would have a very difficult time discriminating on the basis of it. Never , though; Kricheli-Katz & Regev (2016) report the results of a second study where they pulled 100 random sellers from their sample and asked about 400 participants to try and determine the sex of sellers in question. Each participant offered their guesses about five profiles, for a total of 2000 attempts. About 55% of the time, participants got the sex right, 9% of the time they got it wrong, and the remaining 36% of the time, they said they didn't know (which, since they don't know, also means they got it wrong). In short, people couldn't determine the sex reliably about half the time. The authors do mention that the guesses got better as participants viewed more items that the seller had posted, however.
So here's the story they're trying to sell: When people log onto eBay, they seek out a product they're looking to buy. When they find a seller listing the product, they examine the seller's username, the listing in question, and their other listings in their store to attempt and discern the sex of the seller. Buyers subsequently lower their willingness to pay for an item by quite a bit if they see it is being sold by a woman, but only if it's new. In fact, since women made 20% less, the actual reduction in willingness to pay must be larger than that, as sex can only be determined about half of the time reliably when people are trying. Buyers do all this despite even trusting female sellers more. Also, I do want to emphasize the word they, as this would need to be a pretty collective action. If it wasn't a fairly universal response among buyers, the prices of female-sold items would eventually even out with the male price, as those who discriminated less against women would be drawn towards the cheaper prices and bump them back up.
Not only do I not buy this story - not even a little - but I wouldn't pay the authors less for it because they happen to be women if I was looking to make a purchase. While people might be able to determine the sex of the seller on eBay sometimes, when they're specifically asked to do so, that does not mean people engage in this sort of behavior naturally.
Finally, Kricheli-Katz & Regev (2016) report the results of a third study, asking 100 participants how much they value a $100 gift card being sold by either an Alison or a Brad. Sure enough, people were willing to pay Alison less for the card: they got a mere $83 to Brad's $87; a 5% difference. I'd say someone should call the presses, but it looks like they already did, judging from the coverage this piece has received. Now this looks like discrimination - because it is - but I don't think it's based on sex per se. I say that because, earlier in the paper, Kricheli-Katz & Regev (2016) also report that women as buyers on eBay, tended to pay about 3% more than men for comparable goods. To the extent that the $4 difference in valuation is meaningful here, there are two things to say about it. First, it may well represent the fact that women aren't as willing to negotiate prices in their favor. Indeed, while women were 23% of the sellers on eBay, they only represented 16% of the auctions with a negotiation component. If that's the case, people are likely willing to pay less to women because they perceive (correctly) some population differences in their ability to get a good deal. I suspect if you gave them individuating information about the seller's abilities, sex would stop mattering even 5%. Second, that slight, 5% difference would by no means account for the 20% gap the authors report finding with respect to new product sales; not even close.

Instead, my guess is that in spite of the authors' use of the word "equally qualified" when referring to the men and women in their seller sample, there were some important differences in listings the buyers noticed; the type of differences that you can't account for when you're looking at over a million of them and rough control measures aren't effective. Kricheli-Katz & Regev (2016) never seemed to consider – and I mean really consider – the possibility that something about these listings, something they didn't control for, might have been driving sale price differences. While they do control for factors like the seller's reputation, experience, number of pictures, year of the sale, and some of the sentiments expressed by words in the listing (how positive or negative it is), there's more to making a good listing than that. A more likely story is that differences in sale prices reflect different behaviors on the part of male and female sellers (as we already know others differences exist in the sample), as the alternative story attempting to be championed would require a level of obsession with gender-based discrimination in the population so wide and deep that we wouldn't need to research it; it would be plainly obvious to everyone already.
Then again, perhaps it's time I make my way over to eBay to pick up a new tinfoil hat.

Appeal lodged at European court of human rights for disclosure of intelligence sharing policies of UK and foreign agencies
The secret "Five Eyes" treaty that authorises intelligence sharing between the UK, US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand should be published, according to an appeal lodged on Tuesday at the European court of human rights.
The application by Privacy International (PI), which campaigns on issues of surveillance, to the Strasbourg court is the latest in a series of legal challenges following the revelations of the US whistleblower Edward Snowden aimed at forcing the government to disclose details of its surveillance policies.
The civil liberties group alleges that the UK is violating the right to access information by "refusing to disclose the documents that have an enormous impact on human rights in the UK and abroad".
PI says that it has exhausted all domestic legal remedies because its freedom of information request for the document, detailing how the UK's security services collaborate with the National Security Agency (NSA) in the US and other foreign intelligence agencies, met with outright refusal.
"The UK government's GCHQ monitoring service invoked a blanket exemption that excuses it from any obligation to be transparent about its activities to the British public," said PI.
Eric King, deputy director of PI, said: "More than a year after Snowden, the British government continues to dodge the question of just how integrated the operations of GCHQ and NSA truly are. Key documents like the Five Eyes arrangement remain secret, despite them being critical to proper scrutiny of the spy agencies.
"The hushing-up of the extent of the alliance is shameful. The public deserve to know about the dirty deals going on between the Five Eyes, who trade and exploit our private information through this illicit pact. For trust to be restored, transparency around these secret agreements is a crucial first step."
Rosa Curling, of the law firm Leigh Day, which represents PI, said: "The UK's Freedom of Information Act precludes government authorities from disclosing to the public information directly or indirectly supplied by GCHQ.
"This absolute exemption is unlawful and contrary to article 10 of the European convention on human rights, which provides for the right to freedom of expression, which includes the right to receive information.
"It cannot be correct that all information, without exception, directly or indirectly supplied by GCHQ is exempt from public disclosure. With the credibility and public confidence in the activities of the UK's secret service at an all-time low, it is crucial that the [Strasbourg] court considers whether the current darkness in which GCHQ operates is allowed to continue."

Months of inventory:
The “months of inventory” measure is a useful way of determining how quickly homes are selling, how long existing inventory will take to sell off and how to forecast where prices are headed.
Most Real estate agencies suggest that a rate of 4-6 months inventory is considered a “balanced market” with under 4 being a seller's market and over 6 being a buyer's market. A seller's market essentially means that sellers are in the driver's seat and usually prices are rising. A buyer's market means that the buyers have more bargaining power and are able to drive down prices. The ability to move prices largely depends on the number of months of inventory. An extremely low level like 2 months will create sharp increases in prices, whereas an opposite extreme rate like 10 months will create a sharp decrease in prices, and anything around 5 months should keep prices fairly flat.
Saskatoon has been in a strong seller's market situation for approximately eight years now but it appears that the position of power is changing to the buyers, especially in the condominium market.
Using the following chart to further explain this analysis, for condos in the $100,000 – $299,999 category, we currently have 424 units for sale on the MLS system. Over the past month, we have sold 46 units, over the past three months we have sold 186 units and over the course of the year-to-date we have sold 597 units. Based on current inventory, it would take 9.22, 6.84 and 6.89 months respectively to sell off current inventory given those averages across the three time periods.
Based on the above chart, we can see that all price ranges of condominiums are in the territory of a buyer's market. Over the past 30-day period, all condos are now in more extreme territory which means we should begin to see noticeable price drops. You can see that from the years 2011-2014, condo inventory was closer to a level that was balanced with very slight upward pressure on prices.
Not only is there currently a significant oversupply of condos, but there is also a large amount currently under construction which will increase the already excessive supply and put further downward pressure on prices.
Single family houses, on the other hand, are still in balanced territory with the exception of those falling in categories above the $500,000 mark. For houses below the $500,000 mark, we should not expect to see a significant change in prices in the near future as those categories are still within a balanced range. For houses above that price, it's reasonable to expect that we will see significant downward pressure on prices in the near future.
Not only are single-family homes generally in healthier territory, but there are far fewer units under construction than the condo market. Single-family home construction is easier to react to the market compared to condos. Condo construction is a far more lengthy process which creates much slower adjustment times.
Main factors that will lead to price drops in the short term:
Regardless of interest rates, demand and unemployment, if there is a huge oversupply of homes, it will put downward pressure on prices especially if that supply is growing and demand is not keeping up.
1) Current oversupply: this will give buyers far more options and create very long waits for some sellers to get rid of their homes. The longer it takes for sellers to sell, the more likely they are to drop their prices.
2) Less new home build completions: this subsequently means that there will be less new home sales. New homes are, on average, more expensive than resale homes. Even if resale homes do not lose value, the average sales price of all homes will likely drop as we have less new home sales recorded.
3) Large number of units under construction: this will add to swelling inventory and continue to strengthen the power of buyers to drive down prices.
4) Slowdown in new home build starts: although this is good in a sense that it will eventually reduce supply, it does have some bad spillover effects for an economy. If you consider all the professions that are involved in real estate construction, a slowdown in building will create negative job growth in Saskatoon in many sectors. Architects, engineers, interior designers, plumbers, electricians, pavers, roofers and other such fields will see their work slowdown which may create a growth in unemployment. If we do see a decline in employment, many of those out of work may be forced to sell their homes as they will no longer be able to make payments without a steady income. This situation could lead to further supply and add to the already excessive inventory.
Conclusion:
Based on current inventory, sales trends and units under construction, the condo market is at far higher risk of seeing a significant price correction in the near future than single family homes. Single family homes under the $500,000 mark are still within a balanced range with a smaller number of units under construction. This category of homes should be the safest in the end of 2015 and throughout 2016. For homes above $500,000 don't be surprised if we begin to see large price reductions as demand is quite low for these houses and supply is so excessive that it has created a very strong buyer's market in this category. Whatever correction Saskatoon does see, the condo market is looking like it will get the worst of it.

Mass-immigration brings two main challenges. The first is displacement of the traditional population. The second is enlarged membership of the political nation – that is, the grant of voting and other citizenship rights to the newcomers.
These tend to be seen as a single challenge. With or without citizenship rights, immigration on a large enough scale will transform a country. The grant of citizenship rights only becomes critical when the number of alien citizens passes beyond a certain level.
This being said, the two are separable. What brings many immigrants – certainly the tidal wave readying itself at the moment to overwhelm Europe – is the promise of lavish welfare. Some, no doubt, are exactly what the mainstream media tells us they are. Either they are fleeing persecution in their own countries, or they are coming in search of economic opportunities that may bring positive, if limited, benefits to the settled population. But many, it seems, are coming for the free money. Why else are they hurrying through Hungary and the Czech Republic, to claim asylum in Germany?
Moreover, once they are settled in their host countries, it is usually a matter of five or ten years before the newcomers are able to vote. They then swell the constituency of voters for all the policy and legal changes that are summarised by the words “political correctness.”
But suppose entrance to a European country brought no citizenship rights. Suppose there were no welfare, no free education, no hope of citizenship and the vote. As said, some would still come. Fear of persecution at home, or the chance to start a business here, would not be abolished. There would even be some beggars – the streets of Paris or Berlin or London would be more welcoming than the streets of Mogadishu. But the tap would be more than half shut off. The freezing of the electorate would slow the further growth of ethnic voting blocs. The immigration controls we already have might then begin to work.
I will not discuss whether the political will exists to make the necessary changes. I will instead show that the political will has existed in other times and places. Citizenship and its attendant rights have not always been a category granted by the State. Let us take the example of Classical Athens between the 6th and 4th centuries BC.
Ancient Greece was an agglomeration of mostly independent and sovereign city states. Each of these states in turn was a union of prehistoric family groupings. These groupings were united by blood and usually by participation in an associated religious community. To be a citizen of any city state was an automatic right only for full-blood members of one of the family groupings. A grant of citizenship to an outsider was not legally impossible. But the corresponding need to be affiliated with one of the family groupings made it administratively difficult. This was the case in fully sovereign city states, and in those that belonged to wider unions, and even in those that were wholly dominated by a larger city state.
Slaves were, by definition, not citizens. Freed slaves and resident aliens were also not citizens. They fell instead into a category described by the Greek word μέτοικος, or metoikos, or, in English, metic. A metic was not necessarily an immigrant. They may have been born in their city of residence. Their parents may have been born there. So too their grandparents. It was not foreign birth that defined him, but their non-membership of one of the family groupings, and therefore their exclusion from citizenship rights.
Because of its cultural significance, we know more about Athens than any of the other Greek city states. Because of its size and commercial importance, it was home to a very large number of metics. What do the Athenian sources tell us about their political and legal and social status?
First, they had no right to speak and vote in the Assembly. Athens was a citizen's democracy. All matters of foreign and domestic policy were decided by the citizen body meeting as a whole. A declaration of war or treaty of peace or friendship, changes to the civil or criminal law – these all had to be agreed by the Assembly, and this could be attended by all adult male citizens, and by no one else.
Athens did have a small executive – generals and judges and civil servants, and the like. These were elected by lot in much the same way as juries are nowadays filled up, or by direct vote. It goes without saying that these positions were confined to citizens. Apart from this, there was a small police force. This was closed to citizens, being recruited from foreign slaves. Again, metics were excluded.
Metics had the same obligations as citizens. They had to perform military service, and to pay the various taxes voted by the Assembly. They also had to pay a special metic tax. Because they were excluded from political life, they had no access to the often generous payments to citizens who served on juries or executive panels – payments that were effectively welfare benefits for the poor. They also had no right to the periodic distributions of food or other direct welfare benefits.
They were not allowed to own real property. They were barred from certain contracts with the State. They had to register as metics within their district of Athens. Each was required to have a citizen as their sponsor, who might be held responsible for their actions. They were not allowed to marry Athenians, this being regarded as a contamination of the citizen body.
Second, metics had full access to the courts, for the enforcement of contracts and protection of their lives and personal property. At the same time, they lacked the immunity of all citizens from judicial torture, and the penalties for murdering them were lower than for murdering citizens.
Third, metics long settled in Athens were usually indistinguishable in their language and appearance and general manners from citizens. They could often be very rich. If, like Herodotus or Aristotle, they were men of outstanding ability, they might be held in high respect. Except they were not citizens, their status does not appear to have been any social impediment.
The advantage of these arrangements was that law and policy in Athens were entirely in the hands of the Athenian people. Though we have no statistics, it seems that, at times, metics made up half the population of Athens. There is no instance known to us where metic pressure had any decisive weight in the foreign or domestic policy of Athens. All through its age of greatness and wealth, Athens was open to the world. Its open door to immigrants had none of the consequences we now face.
Their disadvantage was that their exclusiveness appears absurd to us, and they probably contributed to the decline of Athens. A third generation metic whose family had come from Corinth or Lesbos, was absolutely indistinguishable from the grandchildren of someone who had fought at Marathon or Salamis. To treat them as a foreigner shocks any modern sensibility. More than that, the tendency of ancient populations was, after about the fourth century, to decline. The Spartans, who were equally exclusive, seem simply to have died out. All the Greek city states were eventually conquered by the Romans, and their citizenship policy was notably promiscuous. St Paul, for example, may have seen Rome only when they arrived there for their trial. They may also not have spoken Latin. But their family had long since had Roman citizenship. Roman power lasted for centuries, partly because those conquered or enslaved by Rome always had at least the promise of full citizenship.
What lessons has any of this for us? Some have already been implied. Athens could function so easily with a high proportion of metics because they were mostly other Greeks. Had they been Carthaginians or Celtic barbarians, the system might have broken down. Also, I have used the phrase “modern sensibility.” The traditional population of England, for example, is as much a family as the citizen body of Athens. Even so, this population has been repeatedly added to, throughout its recorded history, by waves of migration – Germanics, Normans, foreign Protestants, various kinds of East European. We are not quite a nation of immigrants, but assimilation of others is not unprecedented. Then, of course, there is the American experience.
A further point is that, while we might once have been able to draw the line at white immigrants, we are now three generations into mass-immigration. It would be difficult, to put it mildly, to tell the grandchild of a West Indian who came to England in 1948 that they were no longer a citizen, and that they now had to pay to send their children to school.
Using the Greek experience of immigration to undo what has already taken place is probably impossible. Even so, it may be worth considering as an additional measure to limit future immigration.
About 88 percent of the approximately 1,400 suspected noncitizens run through a federal database by the Colorado secretary of state's office were determined to be U.S. citizens — and are eligible to vote.
The Department of Homeland Security is continuing to review the remaining approximately 168 people to determine whether any of them also are citizens, said Michael Hagihara, voter registration manager for the secretary of state's office.
The results of the checks so far were released during a public hearing Wednesday on how Secretary of State Scott Gessler's office will move forward with determining whether anyone still suspected of being a noncitizen should be removed from Colorado's voter rolls.
That process could begin as early as next week. Gessler's office is proposing that either they or their deputy secretary of state would preside over a hearing on each case. They also would make the final judgment as to whether the person may legally cast a ballot — a proposal critics called “alarming.”
Martha Tierney, an attorney who represents the Colorado Democratic Party, noted that the number of voters still in question equals less than one-thousandth of 1 percent of Colorado's approximately 3.5 million registered voters. They suggested the Republican secretary of state's office may have better ways to spend its time with just over two months to go until the November election.
“This is a witch hunt, and you should be embarrassed that you are going down this road,” Tierney said.
But Deputy Secretary of State Suzanne Staiert argued there is good reason to move forward.
They said county clerks have told Gessler's staff “countless stories” about noncitizens who were unknowingly registered to vote when they got their driver's licenses and who have gone to their local elections office in tears because they didn't realize that casting a ballot — a felony in Colorado if the voter isn't a citizen — could jeopardize their chances of becoming naturalized.
They indicated the office is doing those people a favor by notifying them and repeated Gessler's argument that ensuring all voters are eligible helps instill confidence in elections.
“You characterize this as a witch hunt, but there's a very different side that is not being reported,” Staiert said in response to Tierney. “That is the side that we are trying to maintain the integrity of the rolls, and also to the benefit of many people out there who may cast votes unknowingly.”
Six people representing about a dozen organizations spoke against the proposal. No one attended to speak in favor.
Gessler's office mailed letters to about 3,900 suspected noncitizens earlier this month, asking them to prove their citizenship or voluntarily withdraw their voter registration. Those 3,900 were people who at some point showed noncitizen documentation, such as a “green card,” when they applied for a Colorado driver's license and who also are registered to vote.
The office was able to check only 1,400 of those names in the federal database because it had alien registration numbers — which were required to run the check — only for those people, said Richard Coolidge, director of communication for Gessler's office.
Coolidge and Hagihara said Wednesday that no further action will be taken on the approximately 2,500 people who were mailed letters but whose names could not be submitted to the Department of Homeland Security database. But at least some of those people already have withdrawn from the voter rolls or have submitted proof of citizenship, Coolidge said. The office could release those exact numbers Thursday.
State Sen. Pat Steadman, D-Denver, said the state legislature already has established a process for someone to challenge a voter's eligibility. That involves county clerks holding hearings and puts the burden of proof on the challenger, not the voter.
Steadman said Gessler's proposal seemed to do the opposite.
“It appears to sort of take a ‘show me your papers' type approach of putting the burden on the voter to prove that they are in fact eligible to vote,” they said. “I think that's something that should give us all pause.”
Democratic elections attorney Mark Grueskin also questioned whether voters would perceive Gessler — a Republican who did not attend Wednesday's hearing because they are a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla. — or their chief deputy to be impartial enough to be both the arbiter and the de facto prosecutor at any hearing, and what impact that might have on voter confidence.
Staiert, a former municipal judge, said they didn't know how voters would feel, adding, “I don't know the voter, and the voter doesn't know me.”
Samantha Meiring, 37, of Firestone, was one of the people who received Gessler's letter.
An immigrant from South Africa, Meiring became a citizen in early 2010 and voted in Colorado that fall. They said they found it “absolutely ridiculous” that they were being asked to “jump through additional hoops.”
“The people who legally immigrate go through all the legal process to do so, and pay all the thousands of dollars in fees, are the last people on Earth who are going to knowingly commit a felony by voting when they're legally not citizens,” they said. “I think you're chasing people that don't need to be chased.”

Efforts undertaken by the NSA and GCHQ to target groups including WikiLeaks, Anonymous and Pirate Bay using internet surveillance and prosecution have been detailed in an article published by The Intercept.
The latest documents leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden reveal that the NSA went to great lengths to target individuals associated with WikiLeaks, including founder Julian Assange and "the human network that supports it".

One particular document revealed that GCHQ tapped into fibre-optic cables to monitor visitors to the site in real time by tracking their IP addresses. It also tracked the search terms that visitors were using to reach the site, all as part of an operation codenamed ANTICRISIS GIRL. This suggests that internet users from anywhere in the world who visited WikiLeaks regularly could potentially have become a target for the NSA.
The documents also reveal that the NSA labelled WikiLeaks "a malicious foreign actor". The US government encouraged foreign regimes to press charges against Assange over WikiLeaks' publication of Afghanistan war logs. "WikiLeaks strongly condemns the reckless and unlawful behaviour of the National Security Agency," said Julian Assange in a statement published on the WikiLeaks site. They called upon the Obama administration to conduct an investigation into the extent of the NSA's activity regarding the media, including the WikiLeaks network. They also criticised the media-monitoring activities of GCHQ, saying it shows no respect for the rule of law. "No entity, including the NSA, should be permitted to act against journalists with impunity. We have instructed our General Counsel Judge Baltasar Garzón to prepare the appropriate response.
The investigations into attempts to interfere with the work of WikiLeaks will go wherever they need to go. Make no mistake: those responsible will be held to account and brought to justice."
The Intercept -- the new publication launched by ex-Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has headed up the reporting on the Snowden documents -- points out that the WikiLeaks surveillance reveals just how far the NSA's actions stray from its "self-proclaimed focus on terrorism". "The documents call into question the Obama administration's repeated insistence that US citizens are not being caught up in the sweeping surveillance dragnet being cast by the NSA. Under the broad rationale considered by the agency, for example, any communication with a group designated as a 'malicious foreign actor,' such as WikiLeaks and Anonymous, would be considered fair game for surveillance," the site points out.
The targeting of WikiLeaks, Anonymous and Pirate Bay follows earlier revelations that GCHQ used DDoS attacks to target hacker collectives Anonymous and LulzSec. These latest accusations do not reflect well on GCHQ, which maintains its stance that "all of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight". It's hard to see how this would apply to the monitoring of citizens from the UK and abroad who might be doing nothing more than reading the WikiLeaks site.
Zak Hardaker featured in Leeds' first four Super League games of 2015
Leeds Rhinos left Zak Hardaker out of their team for Friday's Super League game at Warrington after confirming they are involved in a police investigation.
England full-back Hardaker, 23, and Leeds team-mate Elliot Minchella, 19, are expected to be interviewed by police over the alleged assault of a 22-year-old man in Leeds on 3 February.
Hardaker had been named in the initial 19-man squad for Friday's match.
The club said both were "co-operating fully" with the investigation.
Their statement read: "The club have been made aware of an incident in which it is alleged that Leeds Rhinos players Zak Hardaker and Elliot Minchella were involved.
"Both the club and the individuals concerned are co-operating fully with the police investigation.
"Until such time as that investigation is concluded neither the club nor the players involved are able to make any further comment."
A police spokesperson said: "We can confirm that we will be speaking to two men in connection with the incident."
FLEMING ISLAND, Fla. - A 41-year-old Fleming Island man is facing aggravated manslaughter charges after their 2-year-old son drowned in a pool while the man was high on heroin, according to the Clay County Sheriff's Office.
Ashley Smart has also been charged with possession of heroin and marijuana.
Aiden Smart was found unresponsive Tuesday morning in the family's swimming pool and was rushed by Clay County Fire Rescue to Baptist Clay in "full cardiac failure." Aiden died 10 minutes after they arrived at the hospital.
Detectives investigating the toddler's death found 0.07 grams of heroin and 2.5 grams of marijuana in Smart's home. They found five full bags and two empty bags of heroin, three needles, a tourniquet and a spoon, according to Smart's arrest report.
The arrest report said Smart's "culpable negligence" led to Aiden's death.
Deputies wouldn't say if Aiden's mother was home when the boy drowned, but News4Jax has learned they might have been at work.
Neighbors said they often saw Aiden playing in the yard without an adult nearby. One woman, who asked to be identified only as Anna, said they saw them alone many times.
“It is so heartbreaking, because again I always saw that little boy whenever I drove by coming home,” Anna said. “I would see them most of the time playing in the yard running around.”
Other neighbors said they were shocked to hear of the toddler's death.
"It's just sickening to me," Ashley Schneider said.
Family members declined to comment.
Smart is being held on $277,000 bond.
The Department of Children and Families is also investigating and released a statement Wednesday:
We are deeply saddened to learn about this child's death. The department has initiated a child death investigation and we will continue to work closely with law enforcement. Additionally, we are providing services to help the family during this difficult time.
The Department of Children and Families had no previous contact with the deceased child.

Just in case you've been hiding under a yoga block lately and haven't heard the news, B.K.S. Iyengar passed away on Wednesday, August 20, 2014.
They succumbed to heart problems and renal failure at the age of 95, in Pune, India, the homeland of Iyengar yogis.
My Facebook feed has been flooded with yogi friends expressing sadness over their death. I'm going to sound like a complete jerk, but I'm saying it anyway.
I think sadness is the wrong reaction. Did we expect them to live forever?
Mr. Iyengar was known as Guruji to countless yogis, and was one of contemporary yoga's greatest luminaries. Light on Yoga remains a bible to yoga practitioners worldwide, whether they practice Iyengar-style or not. Anyone in the yoga world has nothing but the deepest respect for Mr. Iyengar and their contributions to yoga as we know it today.
Their death doesn't change that. So why be sad?
Instead, I'd like to honor their teachings and accomplishments. Their physical body, magnificent as it was, will not be their legacy. A man as influential as Mr. Iyengar will live on through their teachings.
Death is inevitable for every living being, from fruit flies to gurus. It is only an event marking the passage of time and proving the impermanence of life. And since I believe in reincarnation, I try to view death as a process that brings the spirit one step closer to the divine as it sheds one form of being and moves into another.
Iyengar acknowledged the physicality of the body (and thus its impermanence) in Light on Life:
“The material body has a practical reality that is accessible. It is here and now, and we can do something with it. However, we must not forget that the innermost part of our being is also trying to help us. It wants to come out to the surface and express itself.”
The material body of Mr. Iyengar will be missed, especially by their family and friends. My heart goes out to those closest to them who must deal with the harsh reality of never again seeing their beloved face.
But for the thousands (maybe millions?) of us who know their name but never had the privilege of knowing them in person, let's let go of our grief. A living legend is no longer living, but they are still a legend.
Instead of mourning their death, I want to find ways to celebrate their life. The next time I practice, I know I'm going to be thinking of Mr. Iyengar as I lengthen my spine from sacrum to skull.
To cherish B.K.S. Iyengar's still-living legend, I've curated 20 quotes from their teachings:
“I always tell people, live happily and die majestically.”
“It is through your body that you realize you are a spark of divinity.”
“The hardness of a diamond is part of its usefulness, but its true value is in the light that shines through it.”
“When we free ourselves from physical disabilities, emotional disturbances, and mental distractions, we open the gates to our soul.”
“Yoga is a light, which once lit, will never dim. The better your practice, the brighter the flame.”
“There is only one reality, but there are many ways that reality can be interpreted.”
“Spirituality is not some external goal that one must seek, but a part of the divine core of each of us, which we must reveal.”
“It is through the alignment of the body that I discovered the alignment of my mind, self, and intelligence.”
“True concentration is an unbroken thread of awareness.”
“Yoga allows you to find an inner peace that is not ruffled and riled by the endless stresses and struggles of life.”
“When we free ourselves from physical disabilities, emotional disturbances, and mental distractions, we open the gates to our soul.”
“We must create a marriage between the awareness of the body and that of the mind. When two parties do not cooperate, there is unhappiness on both sides.”
“The physical body is not only a temple for our soul, but the means by which we embark on the inward journey toward the core.”
“Yoga is about the will, working with intelligence and self-reflexive consciousness, can free us from the inevitability of the wavering mind and outwardly directed senses.”
”We often fool ourselves that we are concentrating because we fix our attention on wavering objects.”
“Yoga teaches us to cure what need not be endured and endure what cannot be cured. “
“Yoga, an ancient but perfect science, deals with the evolution of humanity. This evolution includes all aspects of one's being, from bodily health to self realization. Yoga means union—the union of body with consciousness and consciousness with the soul. Yoga cultivates the ways of maintaining a balanced attitude in day to day life and endows skill in the performance of one's actions.”
“Action is movement with intelligence. The world is filled with movement. What the world needs is more conscious movement, more action.”
“The union of nature and soul removes the veil of ignorance that covers our intelligence.”
“There is a universal reality in ourselves that aligns us with a universal reality that is everywhere.”

— A Rhode Island mother Thursday paid their respects to fallen Los Angeles police Officer Nicholas Lee, who was featured in a special birthday video for their son battling leukemia.
Rachel Seddon flew from the East Coast to attend the memorial service of 40-year-old Lee, who was killed last Friday when their police cruiser was struck by a heavy-duty truck in Beverly Hills.
“It was very emotional for me…just kinda hit me hard,” they said.
Although Seddon never met the officer, they felt their kindness and compassion through an LAPD video for their 7-year-old son, Tyler.
Tyler is in their second fight with leukemia. For their birthday, Seddon asked police and firefighters to send their son birthday cards.
Seddon said out of all the gifts they received, the LAPD video was the family's favorite.
“Tyler couldn't be here because they were in the hospital, so I just figured what better thing to do than to come out and support them in their time of need, like they're supporting me,” they said.
As a mother of three, Seddon said it was hard to see Lee's two young daughters.
“It's heartbreaking for me to see them, but sitting there thinking he's still looking down on them and he's going to protect them along with the whole LAPD and everyone behind him,” Seddon said.
Seddon hopes that they can bring Tyler out to Los Angeles one day to meet their heroes.

Let's have a quiz and a contest. :)
Suppose you are to make these four brews using similar brewing ratios and a properly aligned EK grinder with settings 1–-11, with 1 being the finest setting, 11 the coarsest.)
Cupping , to be sampled at 12 minutes
v60 , using 22g grounds and a 3:1 prewet plus one main pour
French Press , 4:00 brew time
Fetco, using 120g grounds, 2L of water, an appropriate basket size, 15% prewet, and 4:30 programmed brew time.
The Quiz:
Easy (easier?) question:
1. Put the brews in order, from the finest grind to the coarsest grind AND tell me why, other than empirical evidence, you chose that order.
Bonus question:
2. Based on a v60 grind of #6, predict the grind settings needed to make all four brews extract to roughly the same percent.
The reasoning behind the proper grind settings is straightforward, yet I have never been to a cafe that chose the correct order for those grind settings, let alone remotely correct grind-setting numbers for all of them ("correct" meaning settings likely to produce similar extraction %'s for all brews.) Makes you wonder about the dial-in process at cafes.
Since most readers seem timid about offering blog comments, I'd like to add an enticement: the first person to get #1 right with the correct reasoning gets a free signed copy of any of my books. If you already have my books, thank you, and I'll buy you a copy of The World Atlas of Coffee by James Hoffmann, because it's awesome. If you already have all of those books, I'll find a suitable replacement prize.
The first person to get both #1 and #2 correct earns a book or the option to receive the first production model of an exciting one-cup brewing gizmo I'm in the process of creating. (hint: choose this prize.)
Good luck!
UPDATE
Over 100 readers took a stab at the quiz. Thanks for writing, for having the guts to take a guess, and for the clear communication. I have high-quality readers!
I suppose I'm naive-- I've been asking friends for weeks how to motivate readers to comment on the blog. Now I know: offer them free stuff :)
THE WINNERS ARE.....
QUESTION #1 CAN GENCER!! Great job, Can. Your reasoning was close enough to what I was seeking. For someone who doesn't have an EK, your grind guesses were excellent, as well. I already knew from your prolific blog commenting :) that you have a keen mind.
QUESTION #2 CHRIS CAPELL!!! Judging this was tough. I wanted to be flexible about the numbers, so there was a little judgment involved. And a few readers offered good numbers but hadn't explained their reasons for answer #1.
Chris was the first to get in the ballpark with the numbers and explanation. Congrats Chris!! (full disclosure, Chris worked with me for about a year, circa 2008/9. At least now I know those endless chats about extraction paid off!)
ROSS NICKERSON, GABOR KISS, AND WESTIN MILLS all wrote in with an excellent all-around answer as well. Thank you.
Thanks to everyone for your answers. I'll post all of the comments now and will reply to a few.
QUIZ ANSWERS
FROM FINEST TO COARSEST:
French Press -> Cupping -> V60 -> Batch Brew
*or*
French Press -> v60 -> Cupping -> Batch Brew
This was not a trick- I was willing to accept either order, because measuring the TDS of a cupping is challenging. Whether you stir before sampling and from where in the cup you take the sample have a huge impact on the reading, and it's nearly impossible to trust the reading, as it's too technique-dependent. I measured a cupping this morning and found that depending on whether I agitated the cup, I could get readings of either 1.10 or 1.40. Go figure. Because of this, I wanted to be flexible about where readers put the cupping. Logically, cupping should be coarser than French Press because of the extended contact time in cupping.
THE REASON FOR THE ORDER
Several astute readers noted that percolation (drip) is more efficient than immersion at extraction. (*If a reader wrote "because drip extracts more than immersion" I didn't count that as specific enough--sorry)
Drip is more efficient than immersion primarily because during percolation, strong coffee is being removed from the slurry while fresh, clean water (good solvent) is being added, for most of the process. That keeps the concentration gradient in the slurry much higher for most of a drip brew vs. an immersion. Yes, there are other differences (temperature, amount of convecting of liquid, agitation, etc) but by far the main driver of percolation's superior extraction ability is the higher concentration gradient during much of the brewing process.
Assuming you've read every word of this blog over time (you have, right?), you may remember the discussion about the Ground Control brewer and how repeatedly draining and refreshing the slurry increases extraction a lot.
THE NUMBERS
These numbers are estimates, and I was simply looking for someone to come up with numbers in the ballpark. Depending on the way you sample from a cupping, the alignment of your burrs, etc, these can vary a bit. I was looking for something on the order of
FRENCH PRESS #4--#5
CUPPING #5.5--#7
V60: #6 (it was given)
FETCO: #9.5--#11
A Las Vegas restaurant allegedly bribed a crooked federal agent to raid their rival restaurant, the alleged victims claim.
Club Yamang and Club Sonagi were two Korean supper clubs, which offered food and music, often accompanied by attractive hostesses. But the restaurants' competition turned ugly in 2013, when Club Yamang allegedly began receiving frequent visits from Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Joohoon David Lee. Club Yamang's former owners claim in a Jan. 14 lawsuit against the government that Lee targeted them for sex trafficking investigations, raided their restaurant, and entered misinformation on them in an ICE database—all in exchange for free food and drink at Club Sonagi, where Lee was friends with the owner.
At Club Sonagi, Lee would spend long nights drinking high-end whisky and “routinely generated bills between $1,000.00 to $2,500.00 an evening,” the lawsuit alleges.
But Club Yamang's owners claim Lee never had to pay the exorbitant bar tab. Instead, they allege, Lee agreed to wage war on Club Sonagi's rivals in exchange for unlimited free food and booze.
“It was commonly understood by employees of Club Sonagi that SA [Special Agent] Lee was never to be presented with a bill and/or required to pay any money. All of their food and drinks were to be ‘comped,'” the suit, which names the United States as its only defendant, alleges. “While drunk one evening at Club Sonagi in approximately June 2013, SA Lee boasted to some of the club's waiteres that they were going to ‘raid' Club Yamang in a few weeks.”
Club Sonagi's former owner could not be reached for comment. Lee's former attorney did not return a request for comment and Lee, currently doing time for an unrelated bribery case, was unavailable.
The former ICE agent previously admitted to accepting bribes in December 2015, when they pleaded guilty to accepting thousands of dollars in cash from a Korean business person accused of trafficking a woman into the U.S. as a “sex slave” without their consent. Lee was sentenced to 10 months in prison in July 2016.
An ICE spokesperson declined to comment on the new allegations against Lee, but told The Daily Beast that the agency “has zero tolerance for public officials who abuse their authority and violate the public's trust to feed their own greed. Guarding against illegal or unethical behavior is not an option; it's an obligation we have to the people we serve.”
Just as Lee had allegedly promised, Homeland Security Investigations led a raid of Club Yamang on July 11, 2013 under Lee's direction, the restaurant's former owners said.
“The raid was not supported by legitimate reasons,” the suit claims. “Instead it was based almost entirely upon SA Lee's representations and appeal to crass racial/ethnic stereotypes of Asian clubs as dens of prostitution and human trafficking which SA Lee believed other government officials would be susceptible to believing.”
Paul Padda, an attorney for the former Club Yamang owners, thinks Lee invoked stereotypes of Asian sex work, without properly explaining the concept of a Korean supper club to other law enforcement officials.
“These types of lounges are not only common in Asia but exist right here in the United States in most major cities,” Padda told The Daily Beast. “Frankly, they're not much different than the lounges you'll find in the major hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. What I believe the evidence will show in this case is that ICE Agent Lee attempted to paint the worst possible picture of my client's establishment by playing upon stereotypes.”
During the raid, the restaurant's female employees were allegedly detained, and questioned on their immigration status and whether they were sex workers. One of the detainees was Aeja Kim, the then-fiancée of Club Yamang owner Thomas Kim. During the raid, Aeja was taken to an ICE detention center where Lee “subjected them to an intense interrogation and placed a Global Positioning System (‘GPS') device on their ankle,” the suit alleges.
During the hours-long interrogation, Thomas did not know where their fiancée had been taken. When Aeja finally returned, the couple was allegedly informed that Aeja's ankle monitor would remain on indefinitely, despite the apparent lack of a court order for the device. When Padda met with Lee four months later to discuss removing the monitor, Lee freely admitted that the device was being used to “build” a criminal case against Aeja, the complaint reads.
“My client Aeja Kim had to wear an ankle monitor for almost six months,” Padda told The Daily Beast, adding that, after another ICE agent took an independent look into Aeja's case, the monitor was removed the same day. “It was outrageous.”
But even without ankle monitors, the owners of Club Yamang and their families claimed they felt stalked. Lee would allegedly park their official ICE vehicle outside the restaurant, scaring away customers, and giving employees the impression of constant surveillance, they allege. In December, Lee and an investigator with the Nevada Attorney General's Office allegedly visited the apartment of a female Club Yamang employee and interrogated them on their immigration status within earshot of their neighbors, questioning them on whether they used drugs or was engaged in sex work.
“Lee showed the employee several photographs of [the Club Yamang owners] and notified them that they would all be going to jail soon,” the suit alleges. “He further queried whether they wanted to end up in the same position.”
Two of the owners, a married couple, ran into other issues with ICE that same month. The couple, whom Padda said made trips to South Korea, found themselves interrogated every time they tried to board a plane.
“My client Mi Won Kim and their husband were being flagged for inspection at the airport and getting picked for interrogation by Homeland Security,” Padda said. “On some occasions the questioning would last for two hours. They felt very humiliated every time they were stopped and questioned at length as if they were criminals.”
In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that Lee deliberately entered “misinformation” about the couple into the ICE database, so as to flag them as a flight risk. It wouldn't be the first time Lee was accused of tampering with ICE databases for bribes.
In December 2015, they pleaded guilty to one count of accepting a bribe, after they accepted $9,000 to $10,000 in cash, plus an all-expenses-paid trip to Seoul from an unnamed South Korean business person accused of sex trafficking. In 2012, Lee conducted an interview with a woman who accused the business person of trafficking them into the U.S. as a “sex slave,” ICE announced in a statement, on their plea. They later issued the same business person a favorable ICE report, after the unnamed man paid them up to $10,000 in cash, and funded their trip to Korea.
But while Lee gave the alleged sex-trafficker the all-clear, their efforts at Club Yamang drove the restaurant out of business, its former owners said. With customers and employees retreating from the restaurant and its constant government surveillance, the supper club was forced to close its doors. All five plaintiffs in the case are seeking at least $100,000 in damages, for what they describe as “extreme emotional distress.”
A woman in Long Island, New York, has been charged with money laundering in support of a terrorist organization after they allegedly borrowed money that they used to buy bitcoins to support ISIS.
Zoobia Shahnaz "defrauded numerous financial institutions and obtained over $85,000 in illicit proceeds, which they converted to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies," according to a press release from federal prosecutors. They then allegedly sent the funds outside the United States to support the actions of the Islamic State.
Shahnaz next tried to fly to Turkey. Federal prosecutors say they were ultimately bound for Syria, but they detained them at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.
The press release states that Shahnaz "fraudulently applied for over a dozen credit cards, which they used to purchase approximately $62,000 in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies online." They also obtained a $22,500 loan, which the feds say were obtained through fraudulent means.
Bitcoin is often described as an anonymous payment network, but that's not exactly true. You don't need to disclose your identity to use the Bitcoin network. But Bitcoin's blockchain is public, which means that anyone—including federal prosecutors—can examine the complete record of every bitcoin transaction ever made.
Moreover, mainstream Bitcoin exchanges generally do require customers to provide their identities before they can buy or sell bitcoins. And federal prosecutors can often subpoena these records to link a blockchain address with a real-world identity. With such details, Bitcoin is far from an untraceable method to conduct illicit transactions.
Dozens of senior GOP figures have withdrawn their support for them since
In the 2005 tape, Trump boasted they could 'grab women by the p****'
Donald Trump's top donors, a billionaire business person and their daughter, stood by them on Saturday despite an exodus of endorsers within the GOP party amid the fallout from their crude hot-mic comments.
Robert and Rebekah Mercer dismissed Trump's boast that they could 'grab them by the p****' as nothing more than 'locker room braggadocio', insisting their support remained squarely behind the business person.
In a lengthy statement issued to The Washington Post, the father-daughter-duo said they were not surprised by the release of a 2005 tape in which Trump was heard discussing their aggressive sexual strategies.
'Donald Trump's uncensored comments, both old and new, have been echoed and dissected in the media repeatedly in an effort to kindle among their supporters a conflagration of outrage commensurate with the media's own faux outrage.
Robert and Rebekah Mercer (above, left), a father and daughter who run the largest pro-Trump super Pac, have maintained their support for the candidate in the wake of a leaked 2005 tape in which they made lewd comments about women
'Can anyone really be surprised that Mr. Trump could have said to Mr. Bush such things as they have already admitted saying? No. We are completely indifferent to Mr. Trump's locker room braggadocio,' they said.
The pair, who control a bountiful super PAC which supports the Republican candidate, then pointed to Bill Clinton and their alleged sexual impropriety.
Their statement of support came as a steady stream of GOP figures withdrew theirs from Trump's campaign.
Other donors are reportedly asking for their money back.
CBS cited one campaign insider who said they had been inundated with calls from donors expressing buyer's remorse since the tapes were released.
Trump refused to withdraw their bid for the White House on Saturday
Their retreat came after a 2005 Access Hollywood tape was released on Friday in which Trump, then newly married to their wife Melanie, told how they 'immediately' kissed women without waiting - and how they allowed them to because they were a 'star'.
'You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them.
'It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.'
'Grab them by the p---y. You can do anything.'
Trump has since apologized, admitting they were 'wrong'.
They have been admonished by Speaker Paul Ryan, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and even their own running mate, Mike Pence, over the comments.
The Mercers however stopped short of addressing the comments specifically in their statement.
The Mercers turned their wrath on Bill Clinton who they said had 'multiple violent sexual assaults to their credit'
The Mercers started the Republican super PAC which has morphed into Defeat Crooked Hillary. It began as a fund to support Senator Ted Cruz in their bid for the Republican presidential nomination
Instead they lay their disgust with Bill Clinton who they said had 'snared a young intern into their web', referring to Monica Lewinsky, the White House aide Clinton later had sex with while President.
'We can remove the uncivil nastiness of emphasizing candidates' personal behavior which will not affect our lives compared to the policies implemented,' they concluded.
Robert Mercer was named the 15th highest earning hedge fund manager in the world in 2015. They sit at the helm of Renaissance Technologies Corp.
Their middle daughter Rebekah spearheaded a super PAC in support of Senator Ted Cruz. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, ran the committee.
The PAC evolved into Defeat Crooked Hillary, the group responsible for smearing adverts about the Democratic candidate, after Trump clinched the Republican nomination.
It's not known exactly how much the duo have spent trying to put Trump in the White House.
Mr Mercer devoted more than $11million to backing Ted Cruz and has invested in several conservative interests including the Breitbart News Network and the Heritage think tank, according to Bloomberg.com.

Solar Eclipse Warning! Looking directly into the sun without the special protection provided by solar filters or eclipse glasses can cause irreversible eye damage even blindness.

LIVE STREAM TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE
The United States is preparing to experience the first total solar eclipse, unique in nearly 38 years, which will include both ribs on August 21, giving millions of Americans the opportunity to observe a celestial event of a special rarity.
NASA has provided details and advice on the near eclipse caused by the moon passing between the sun and the Earth, projecting its shadow and making visible a solar corona (which is not usually seen) as well as the stars and bright planets on the dark sky.
On Monday, August 21, when the Moon will pass between the Sun and the Earth, it will produce a shadow about 110 kilometers wide (68.35 miles) , moving from Oregon to the extreme northwest in the middle of the morning to South Carolina, On the other side of the country in the afternoon, crossing 14 US states in about two hours.
It is also an exclusive eclipse: only the United States will have its visibility! It is expected that many tourists will come especially to follow the spectacular phenomenon that will turn night into day.
In the rest of the US, a partial solar eclipse will be visible, said astronomer Rick Fienberg, spokesperson for the American Astronomical Society (AAS).
But they think nothing compares with the experience of witnessing a total solar eclipse, an exceptional event. “Never seeing a full solar eclipse is like living your life without ever falling in love,” the American astronomer said, revealing that they have seen 12 such eclipses so far.
Spectators from other parts of the world and scientists will have access to many images captured before, during and after the eclipse of 11 planes, of which at least three will belong to NASA, over 50 stratospheric balloons, satellites and even astronauts Aboard the International Space Station (ISS), each image being captured from different angles.
NASA's television station will broadcast live images of the eclipse, as well as various activities associated with this event, which will be organized in national parks, libraries, stadiums, museums, and festivals.
Astronomers also warn about the danger to the eyes if the Sun is viewed without special lens glasses during the partial eclipse.

President Trump began their day Tuesday with a series of tweets expressing open hostility toward their own attorney general. “Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!” Trump wrote. “Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign—‘quietly working to boost Clinton.' So where is the investigation A.G. @seanhannity.” According to a report from the Associated Press, Trump has spoken with advisers about firing Sessions. Just a day earlier, Trump attacked a “beleaguered” Sessions for failing to look into Clinton's emails from their private server. Last week the commander in chief told The New York Times they would not have appointed Sessions if they knew they would recuse themselves from the Russia probe. Trump also cheered son-in-law/adviser Jared Kushner for their public denial of election collusion with Russian officials and snarked that another family member will be targeted next. “Jared Kushner did very well yesterday in proving they did not collude with the Russians. Witch Hunt. Next up, 11 year old Barron Trump!”
Is Mitt Romney really changing their electoral strategy? That question arises because that's what a top Romney aide says the GOP nominee has done.
Senior adviser Ed Gillespie in a conference call with reporters said Mr. Romney is shifting to provide voters with more specifics about their policy plans. Voters “are eager to hear more details about policies to turn our economy around,” said Mr. Gillespie, adding that Romney won't outline new plans so much as “reinforce” proposals he's already issued.
The “timing is right” for this move, added Gillespie, as millions of voters are now tuning in to Campaign 2012 after the Republican and Democratic national conventions.
As to what this might mean in practice, an ad posted Monday on YouTube by the Romney team provides a hint. Titled “The Romney Plan," the 40-second ad lists the main categories of Romney's longtime economic plan: new trade agreements and a crackdown on Chinese trade cheating; deficit reduction; and tax and regulation reductions that help small business.
Gillespie also listed some of Romney's preexisting energy positions as the sort of thing that might get a bigger push in days ahead. Romney would approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline, allow more exploration for oil and drilling on federal land, and so forth. These are “specifics that people go, ‘Oh, I see, that's how you could get to be energy independent by 2020,' ” said Gillespie.
Candidates have lots of different strategies for lots of different things, so it's hard to judge whether Romney's Boston team has really changed its overarching view of the election. We'd think they probably haven't, given that they're not talking about any sort of real departure from things they've said before.
But what this does appear to be is a shift in communications strategy to try to refocus the election on the economy and where it's headed.
Why? Well, it's possible Romney is just trying to turn the mainstream media's narrative of the race. A big story in Politico about infighting among their top aides is something he'd surely love to bury. Perhaps worse, some recent polls have shown that President Obama has drawn even with Romney on the measure of which candidate voters would trust to handle economic issues.
But we'd bet that Team Romney has thought about this move a bit more broadly than that. We think it's possible it is really driven by the calendar, and the looming presidential debates.
The debates might be Romney's last chance to shake up the race. By repeating their own policy proposals, they may be trying to set up a comparison with Mr. Obama on specifics. They want to present themselves as the leader with a plan for the future, while the incumbent is just a tired force who's clinging to the things they tried in the first four years.
At the Democratic National Convention, Obama in essence said they needed more time to finish the job he's already started. Ex-President Bill Clinton made that argument most forcefully, saying nobody could have cleaned up the mess Obama inherited in just one term.
But can't you see where Romney might be going here? He's trying to set up the debates so they can turn to Obama and say, in essence, “This is my plan. What do you propose that hasn't already been tried?”
Gillespie hinted at this approach during their conference call, saying voters are also curious about Obama and what they might do in a second term if reelected.
“They haven't heard many details from them or many policy proposals at all from him,” said Gillespie.
This may sound like a long shot on the part of the Romney campaign, but remember, the election is now only weeks away. As Davidson College election expert Josh Putnam notes Monday on their Frontloading HQ blog, the problem Romney faces is that it can be difficult to oust an incumbent president in an electoral environment that is challenging but offers that incumbent some hopeful trends to highlight.

That's why the campaign horse race has been so stable for months, with Romney always just a tick behind.
“The Romney campaign is in the same position plenty of underdog candidates/campaigns have been [in]: behind and looking for the right combination of things to right the ship. There isn't an easy out and ... time is running short,” writes Mr. Putnam.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday named the new head of its division tasked with overseeing the FBI probe of Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, was named as the new acting assistant attorney general of the DOJ's National Security Division.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsTrump says they haven't spoken to Barr about Mueller report Ex-Trump aide: Can't imagine Mueller not giving House a ‘roadmap' to impeachment Rosenstein: My time at DOJ is 'coming to an end' MORE hailed the federal prosecutor as "a dedicated public servant," acknowledging Boente's service as acting attorney general in the early days of the Trump administration. Rod Rosenstein was confirmed as the DOJ's No. 2 on Tuesday, freeing Boente to head the department's security division.
“In recent months, they have provided extraordinary leadership during the transition period,” Sessions said of Boente in a statement. "I am pleased that they have agreed to continue their service by leading our efforts to keep America safe."

Boente succeeds Mary McCord, who announced earlier this month that they would depart in May. They joined the National Security Division in 2014 and became its head after John Carlin resigned in October 2016. Sessions thanked McCord for their service on Friday.
The Department of Justice said Boente would continue serving as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Senate confirmed Boente to that role in December 2015 under former President Obama's watch.
Boente's office in Virginia has jurisdiction over the CIA, the Pentagon and other security agencies in the state. The office routinely handles espionage and leak and terrorism cases, much like the National Security Division.
Boente became the DOJ's acting attorney general in January when President Trump fired Sally Yates after they ordered the DOJ not to defend their initial executive order temporarily barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S.
The measure also temporarily paused refugee admissions into the U.S. and indefinitely halted letting in Syrian refugees, but it and a subsequent order have been blocked in courts.

Recent Changes ‎ > ‎ Android Studio 0.4.4 Released Bug fixes. A lot of them. Thank you for filing bugs at http://b.android.com, and keep them coming! Of particular note we've fixed the bug where library dependencies were sometimes dropped (and resources and Java symbols show up in red.)
Merged to the latest IntelliJ 13 EAP build 133.696
Retina support on OSX. If you're displaying Android Studio on a retina-density screen on OSX, using JDK 6 or recent versions of JDK 7, we will render your layouts in full Retina resolution. This is not just for layouts, but for the editor margin previews of drawable resources too. It's hard to convey this on a web page without Retina density, but here's a zoomed in view of the editor preview before (with Retina density text, and non-Retina icon painting as handled in Studio versions prior to 0.4.4) :
Here's the same editor now with Retina handling of these drawable resources:
Here's the same editor now with Retina handling of these drawable resources:This makes an even bigger difference in the layout editor and with the XML layout preview feature, since the images in question are much larger. You can typically see your phone layouts in full resolution (no scaling involved.)
Lint
Lint now checks Gradle files. It will warn about
Obsolete dependencies (e.g. not using the latest play services, not using the latest build tools, etc)
Using absolute paths
Using Windows path separators
Using incompatible combinations of tools libraries (such as using a support library older than the target SDK version)
Using + syntax in dependencies (not enabled by default)
Accidentally calling DSL methods (such as attempting to set versionName by calling a local method named getName)
Using constructs not properly handled by the IDE support (such as reassigning a project's directory)
New lint check warning about using a <WebView> with size wrap_contents
Lint checks suggesting to use SparseLongArray and LongSparseArray
Lint running inside Android Studio now consults a project's lint.xml (to for example change the severity of an issue from warning to error or vice versa)
The layout editor now supports rendering device frames (which was only available in layout preview until this point). It also has a render settings menu (to turn off device frames) and a Refresh action.
Templates
Newly created projects are initialized with the right build.gradle setup such that you can simply put .jar and .aar files into the libs/ directory and they will automatically be used (similar to how the libs/ folder worked in Eclipse ADT.)
The New Notification template is back (found under New > Android Component)
Gradle Integration
The Gradle daemon is shutdown on IDE exit, which should fix the Android Studio update mechanism on Windows (starting after the next update.) Installation If you are already running Android Studio, just restart it, or manually check for updates via Help > Check for Update... (on OSX, look in the Android Studio menu).

We've just released Android Studio 0.4.4 with the following improvements:
The “commander” of an antigovernment Minnesota militia — a man who was trained in intelligence gathering by the U.S. Army and currently serving in the National Guard — was arrested yesterday by the FBI on charges of stealing the classified personnel roster of 400 members of their former military unit.
Keith Michael Novak, 25, who served in Iraq with the Army's 82nd Airborne Division before joining the Minnesota Army National Guard, stole the identity information in a scheme to fund and provide fake identities for their militia unit, according to a federal criminal complaint.
The case was the latest example of extremists in military units, a problem that the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has focused much public attention on over the years. In 2006, the SPLC's Intelligence Report detailed a large number of extremists in the military, eventually leading to a tightening of military regulations.
In the Minnesota case, Novak told two undercover FBI agents they had the 400 encrypted identities — a “battalion's worth of people” — for use if someone “ever wanted to disappear and become someone else,” the document says.
Novak also is believed to possess other items stolen from the military, including flak jackets, riot gear and communication equipment, the FBI complaint says.
The FBI put a hidden transmitter on Novak's vehicle and secretly tape recorded conversations undercover agents had with them as part of the 10-month investigation, the document reveals. During one of those conversations, Novak said they were ready for a shootout with law enforcement if someone attempted to kick in their door, adding that they had thousands of rounds of ammunition and firearms hidden in caches throughout Minnesota. They were arrested without incident.
As Novak was being arrested, the FBI used its specialized Computerized Analysis Response Team to seize computers and peripherals, carrying out searches of at least three locations, including Novak's apartment in Maplewood, Minn., a storage facility and their vehicle. Results of those searches haven't been disclosed.
If stolen military equipment is found, Novak could face additional charges when the case is presented to a federal grand jury in Minneapolis.
Lt. Col. Kevin Olson, spokesperson for the Minnesota National Guard, and Lt. Col. Virginia McCabe, spokesperson for the 82nd Airborne Division, told The Associated Press yesterday that their respective units were cooperating with the FBI in the investigations.
Novak was an “intelligence analyst” with the 82nd Airborne Division from February 2009 to Sept. 3, 2012, including a tour in Iraq from Jan. 3, 2010, to Aug. 6, 2010, the complaint affidavit says.
After leaving active duty, Novak joined the Minnesota Army National Guard and was given the job as a “human intelligence collector.” They were sent last January to a special three-month counter-intelligence training course at Camp Williams, Utah. “This course was conducted in several phases of instruction which included instruction of ‘Interrogation Operations of the Human Intelligence,' ‘Military Source Operations of the Human Intelligence Collector,' and ‘Tactical Operations,'” the affidavit says.
While attending the military training in Utah, the documents says Novak met two men claiming to be members of a Utah militia unit who actually were undercover FBI agents.
Novak described their “intelligence collection methodology” and invited the two men to Minnesota “where they would provide them training on various military intelligence-related tasks, including the creation of ‘target packages' and the effective conduct of interrogations,” the document says.
During a second meeting with the undercover agents, Novak allegedly described how they stole classified material from Fort Bragg, N.C., when they were assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division.
The court document says the material was a “Sensitive Compartmentalized Access Roster,” or SCARS, which included what the Army describes as “personally identifiable information,” such as full names, dates of birth, places of birth, Social Security numbers, military ranks, security clearance levels and types of clearance investigation.
It's not clear from the document whether or not the FBI has notified the individuals whose identities were stolen.
As part of the FBI's investigation, a court-authorized tracking device was placed on Novak's vehicle on May 13 and the undercover agents wore hidden body recorders when they traveled to Minnesota for meetings with them in July.
The charging document describes Novak as “a member of a Minnesota militia organization where they are the self-described commander. This is not a military unit of the United States, the State of Minnesota or any other government entity,” the document says. But it doesn't further identify the militia group.
During the July meeting, Novak instructed one of the undercover agents to buy a high-resolution digital camera to copy classified information which was then transferred to a computer and two electronic storage devices, using encrypted files. The plan was to have the undercover agents manufacture false identifications for Novak to provide to at least 10 members of their militia unit.
On Sept. 28, five days after Novak transmitted seven identities, the two undercover agents attended a “military-style field training exercise” with them “in rural Minnesota.” The following month, the document says, Novak offered to sell additional identities as a way of making money to fund their militia unit.
On Nov. 25, at their apartment, Novak accepted $2,000 from the two undercover agents for the identities of 44 individuals he'd provided them three weeks earlier. They “described having destroyed the physical copies of the SCARS document, but saved a digital version “in a really good spot that can never be found.”
The Three Part Breath (Deergha Swasam), is a wonderful tool that you can add to your ever-expanding repertoire of mindfulness techniques. Use it to focus your attention, summon your confidence, or turn down that noise in your head.
This form of pranayama uses a big, healthy inhalation to fill the bottom, middle and then top of your lungs. The exhalation then releases the breath from the top down. It delivers lots of fresh oxygen to your body and your brain, soothes your nerves, and brings you back to the present moment.
To help deepen and direct your breath, you can begin this practice by placing your palms below your belly button, on the sides of your ribcage, and over your heart. You will feel each part of your body rise and sink as you breathe in and out. By focusing on expansion in the body instead of trying to just suck in more air through the nose, you can breathe more comfortably and deeply.
Here's how it's done; scroll down for a complete step-by-step guide:
One afternoon, the head of my department caught me in the staff room and posed a musing question.
(He later confessed that they were just curious if they could play puppet-master with this blog. The answer is a resounding yes: I dance like the puppet I am.)
So, do we have ceilings?
The traditional orthodoxy says, “Absolutely yes.” There's high IQ and low IQ. There are “math people” and “not math people.” Some kids just “get it”; others don't.
Try asking adults about their math education: They refer to it like some sort of NCAA tournament. Everybody gets eliminated, and it's only a question of how long you can stay in the game. “I couldn't handle algebra” signifies a first-round knockout. “I stopped at multivariable calculus” means “Hey, I didn't win, but I'm proud of making it to the final four.”
But there's a new orthodoxy among teachers, an accepted wisdom which says, “Absolutely not.”
You've got to love the optimism, the populism. (Look under your chairs—everybody gets a category theory textbook!) But I think you've got to share my pal Karen's skepticism, too.
Do we have a ceiling, Karen?
Karen works hard. Karen asks questions. Karen believes in herself. And Karen still feels that certain mathematics lies beyond their abilities, above their ceiling.
The chasm between students (“everybody's got a limit”) and teachers (“anyone can do anything!”) seems unbridgeable. A teacher might say “You can do it!” as encouragement, but a frustrated student might hear those words as an indictment of their effort (or as a delusional falsehood). Is there any way to reconcile these contradictions?
I believe there is: the Law of the Broken Futon.
In college, my roommates and I bought a used futon (just a few months old) off of some friends. They lived on the first floor; we were on the fourth. Kindly, they carried it up the stairs for us.
As they crested the third-floor landing, they heard a crack. A little metallic bar had snapped off of the futon. We all checked it out, but couldn't even figure out where the piece had come from. Since the futon seemed fine, we simply shrugged it off.
After a week in our room, the futon had begun to sag. “Did it always look like this?” we asked each other.
A month later, it was embarrassingly droopy. Sit at the end, and the curvature of the couch would dump you (and everyone else) into one central pig-pile.
And by the end of the semester, it had collapsed in a heap on the dusty dorm-room floor, the broken skeleton of a once-thriving futon.
Now, Ikea furniture is the fruit-fly of the living room: notoriously short-lived. There was undoubtedly a ceiling on our futon's lifespan, perhaps three or four years. But this one survived barely eight months.
In hindsight, it's obvious that the broken piece was absolutely crucial. The futon seemed fine without it. But day by day, with every new butt, weight pressed down on parts of the structure never meant to bear the load alone. The framework grew warped. Pressure mounted unsustainably. The futon's internal clock was silently ticking down to the moment when the lack of support proved overwhelming, and the whole thing came crashing down.
And, sadly, so it is in math class.
Say you're acing eighth grade. You can graph linear equations with perfect fluidity and precision. You can compute their slopes, identify points, and generate parallel and perpendicular lines.
But if you're missing one simple understanding—that these graphs are simply the x-y pairs satisfying the equation—then you're a broken futon. You're missing a piece upon which future learning will crucially depend. Quadratics will haunt you; the sine curve will never make sense; and you'll probably bail after calculus, consoling yourself, “Well, at least my ceiling was higher than some.”
You may ask, “Since I'm fine now, can't I add that missing piece later, when it's actually needed?” Sometimes, yes. But it's much harder. You've now spent years without that crucial piece. You've developed shortcuts and piecemeal approaches to get by. These worked for a while, but they warped the frame, and now you're coming up short. In order to move forward, you've got to unlearn your workarounds – effectively bending the futon back into its original shape – before you can proceed. But it's well nigh impossible to abandon the very strategies that have gotten you this far.
Adding the missing piece later means waiting until the damage is already underway, and hellishly difficult to undo.
This, I believe, is the ceiling so many students experience. It's not some inherent limitation of their neurology. It's something we create. We create it by saying, in word or in deed, “It's okay that you don't understand. Just follow these steps and check your answer in the back.” We create it by saying, “Only the clever ones will get it; for the rest, I just want to make sure they can do it.” We create it by saying, “Well, they don't understand it now, but they'll figure it out on their own eventually.”
In doing this, we may succeed in getting the futon up the stairs. But something is lost in the process. Sending our students forward without key understandings is like marching them into battle without replacement ammo. Sure, they'll fire off a few rounds, but by the time they realize something is missing, it'll be too late to recover.
A student who can answer questions without understanding them is a student with an expiration date.

Game Show announced Global Esports Cup with $200,000
Game Show have just announced their new CS:GO project called Global Esports Cup, that will feature teams from Europe, CIS and America fighting for the share of $200,000.
Global Esports Cup Coverage Hub Click here for results, VODs and all the other information
Following their success with two editions of CS:GO League, Game Show have gone further this time announcing one of the biggest CS:GO tournaments. The new project is called Global Esports Cup, and it will expand from Europe to CIS and America as well. Moreover, the tournament organisers have made sure to meet all Team Union requirements and therefore the prize pool is set to $200,000 which doesn't include travel and accomodation support. Finally, the LAN finals will be held in Vilnius, Lithuania.
Since, this will be the biggest Game Show's CS:GO tournament to date, they made sure to come up with a new model. The European part will see a double group stage, while CIS and American regions will use format of only one group stage. Another important fact is that this tournament will be open for anyone, as besides the invited teams those who top the open qualifiers will have a chance to test themselves in this circuit.
European Division:
- Group stage 1: Eight invited teams will be joined by eight qualified teams from the open qualifiers. They will form four groups of four teams in each and battle it out through the GSL (double-elimination) system in best-of-three matches. The top two teams of each group will then move on to the second stage.
- Group stage 2: Eight invited teams + Eight teams qualified from the group stage one. They will form new groups with four in each and battle it out once again in GSL (double-elimination) format. The top two teams of each group will move to the playoffs.
- Playoffs: Only the quarter final matches will be played. The winners of these matches will qualify for the LAN finals.
CIS and American Divisions:
- Group Stage: Eight invited teams plus eight qualified teams. GSL (double-elimination) format with top two teams of each group moving to playoffs.
- Playoffs: Single elimination bracket, the top two teams of each bracket moves to LAN finals.
By checking the format of this event it's clear that European division will give four teams for LAN finals, while CIS and American divisions will grant two spots each. Below you can find all the information about qualifiers which are being hosted by FACE IT:

ARMS is getting a new update this week, and although the official stance is that it will introduce balancing changes, dataminers have uncovered evidence that something more substantial could be coming to the game soon.
Digging through the game's code, a list of character names has been found. Some of these are nicknames for existing fighters - we're guessing they were internal names for characters before their final monikers were decided upon - but not all of them match up:
Belt (Max Brass)
Chain
Coil
DNA (Helix)
Hair (Twintelle)
Mee (Min Min)
Mummy (Mummy)
Ninja (Ninjara)
Plant
Police (Byte and Bark)
Ribbon (Ribbon Girl)
Robo
Scroll
Snake (Kid Cobra)
Spring (Spring Man)
Sumo
Surprise
Sweet
Twintale
Worker (Mechanica)
BossHead (Hedlok)
RNA (Dummies)
Could some of these names refer to characters that were removed before the game was finished, or are they all-new fighters which will be added via DLC? Let us know your thoughts by posting a comment.

A dozen immigrants sit in a classroom. The walls are plastered with world maps, desks are stacked with maple cookies, and a table is piled high with tarps and sleeping bags. They've come to learn about the venerable Canadian practice of sleeping under the stars, also known as camping. The workshop is a Parks Canada initiative, started in 2011, meant to ease newcomers into the wild. This session, held last year inside an Edmonton Catholic Social Services office, is one of the agency's biggest yet: forty-seven people from three continents have committed to spending the September long weekend surrounded by Jasper National Park's mountains, lakes, and glaciers, and a quarter of them have shown up to this pre-trip primer.
“Can anyone translate Arabic?” asks settlement-orientation coordinator Frank Bessai, attempting a to conduct a roll call over an eight-language cacophony.
Hanan Omar, a young Somali woman clad in black from head scarf to sneakers, eagerly raises their hand. Balqees, an Iraqi mother with adult children, and Mohammad, a Syrian father of seven, slide their chairs close to hers. Bessai sets up one translation network between them and another between Kirundi speakers, and places themselves between those who speak Russian. They give the floor to park interpreter Kevin Gedling. “What is a national park?” Gedling asks, slowly enunciating every word. “It's an example of a special place in Canada. Our job at Parks Canada is to protect national parks and to show national parks to people who live in Canada and around the world. And that includes you.”
That's the pitch, but it's not the whole story. Since 2001, national parks visits have stalled at around twelve million, down from sixteen million the year before. As a result, the federal agency has begun to focus on attracting young people, urban dwellers, and newcomers to Canada. For the first two target demos, Wi-Fi hotspots have been added to some parks, and so have powered, heated, A-frame cabins; for the third, there's Learn to Camp.
Nearly half of Learn to Camp's 1,800 annual participants come because they've been told that camping is fun, according to Parks surveys. A fifth attend because they've heard camping is a core Canadian tradition, as much a part of our identity as hockey and politeness. But many immigrants to the country make their homes in urban spaces and seldom get out to see the remote wilderness by which Canada defines itself internationally. So for Parks, the message can't just be that camping is Canadian—it must also be that camping is easy.
For families such as Omar's, any cost is a barrier. The Omars are refugees from Somalia. When their father was killed in 2006, Hanan, along with their mother and five younger siblings, fled to Syria. Five years later, it, too, was embroiled in civil war. Last July, they took sponsorship in Edmonton. Them younger brothers and sisters are now going to school, and Hanan, a twenty-year-old aspiring nurse, is upgrading their education. Gedling says it could be ten years before families such as theirs are able to afford another trip into the mountains like the one they're about to take.
Though campers often leave the parks feeling inspired, getting them there is a challenge. For example, there are the language barriers and the fear of exotic wildlife—especially bears. (“It's illegal to hurt the animals,” Gedling tells a teenage boy who requests a knife for self-defence.)
Many participants have camped, just never for fun, so understanding that concept is also an obstacle. “If you tell a bunch of people from central Africa that we're going to walk up that mountain, they're going to say, why?” Bessai says. “‘Is there something we need? Is there firewood up there?' You don't just walk up mountains to enjoy the nature and recreational experience.” The idea of sleeping in tents for pleasure rather than necessity is especially confounding—and that's what loses Balqees, the Iraqi refugee who had planned to bring their son and daughter on the trip. Staring at a photo of a family bundled up in a tent, they yelp, “Shukran jazeelan!”—a sarcastic thanks but no thanks.
Gedling's opening definition of a national park may have been too broad. “So,” they backtrack, “camping means to sleep outside.”
Omar translates this for the Arabic-speaking attendees, but it only confuses them further. They try to explain that sleeping in the wilderness is something Canadians actually enjoy.
By the time Gedling unrolls the mustard-coloured six-person tent to demonstrate how to pitch it, Balqees has left. They and their children will also be no-shows for the trip on Friday morning. Meanwhile, Omar jumps into action, threading a tent pole through its loops with a grin.
After returning from their weekend in Jasper, she's hooked. Despite the frigid, rainy weather and a few encounters with aggressive elk in the midst of mating season, it was the first true family outing they could remember taking. “We don't have fun like that before in ten years,” Omar says. They learned how to cut wood, start a fire, and put up a tent. They saw countless animals and sang campfire songs.
The only thing missing? “I want to see bears.” Next time, they hope.
Tonight, FNRGFE will face off against the newly invigorated FaZe Clan. FaZe stocked up with Surefour and Carpe, two beastly DPS-players. When adding Shadowburn to the mix, not many teams in the West would be able to compete with their dealers. Fortunately, Overwatch is more than a 2v2 game and history has taught us that teams with strong Tanks and Supports tend to even slightly outperform DPS-heavy teams. The most prominent roster with support cast focus is, of course, Lunatic Hai and they now have two Apex titles under their belt.
One useful tool to categorize these teams with is the Percentage of a Team's Kills, in short PTK-Model. When taking all the recent relevant tournaments into account, the current average for teams in both Contenders EU & NA are approximately 48% DPS, 36% Tanks and 16% Support kills. For FNRGFE, the supports frag slightly more at 17% while taking away a portion from the DPS. Under the microscope, their Flex support Bani are a solid performer that simply doesn't have a bad pick and will always deliver on all the heroes they play. There is one aspect, however, where they aren't up to snuff and that is Kills. Their PTK on Ana is at 5% which is a whopping 32% less than average. On Zenyatta, they were at 9.3%, which is 18% below par. So how come FNRGFE is still a support weighted team? Enter Boink, the Carry Lucio.
Over a solid sample size of four hours at the Beat Invitational 2, Boink had a PTK of 10.7%. That is about a third more than the average Lucio gets in their respective teams. In itself, that already is really impressive for a Lucio that also only dies 3.43 times per 10 minutes, 25% less than Lucios at Beat. Boink is up in your face, but rarely ever dies and if they do, they avoid being the important first blood better than others too (5.5% First death (-19%))
Getting the First Kill of a team fight in Overwatch is incredibly important. In professional play, the team that gets first blood will win the fight 77% of the time. This is exactly where Boink goes nuts in comparison to their fellow Lucios. Their First Kill is at an incredible 5.5% ratio, 55% more than average.
Need an example? During the Beat Invitational 2 FNRGFE played against Tempo Storm on King's Row. With their backs against the wall, at a severe ultimate disadvantage and overtime approaching quickly, Boink ends up making all the difference. Despite the urgency of having to touch the payload, the backline of FNRGFE is pushed back. Dreamkazper on Genji has their Dragonblade up and tries to get into a position to finish them off.
They decide to swing it around on Genji and focus him, but they still have Deflected ready and looks for the mega health pack to their left. In most of all cases, this would have worked. Not so with Boink around.
They take the wall ride up the left wall, jumps high and with the added momentum they remain in line of sight of Dreamkazper. At the peak of their jump, they fire three projectiles which, as if they could go nowhere else, nail Tempo Storm's hopes right in the head. Before Boink hits the ground, their sound waves end the Genji as their ultimate indicator still flashes bright and blue. Upon landing, they break into a little hop, much like a super ball, and you can almost hear the sound. *Boink*.
FNRGFE on the back of this first blood ride the payload to completion and ultimately end up winning the map, one which would later allow them to advance past Tempo Storm.
Boink is looking to deliver such game-winning performances tonight against FaZe too. Their team is certainly the underdog – if you were to believe us here at Winston's Lab anyway – but Boink could be the difference-maker that would allow for such an upset.

Off you go: Bulldog David Klemmer shows their disgust after being sent to the sin bin for dissent during the round five clashes with South Sydney. Credit:Getty Images As the match officials came from the ground they were pelted with objects, with linesman Nick Beashel hitting the deck as sections of the crowd vented their anger. While one Bulldogs punter was banned for 10 years for attacking a Rabbitohs fan without provocation, many of the troublemakers escaped detection because the broadcast and CCTV footage was inconclusive. ANZ Stadium officials are meeting with both clubs before the match while NSW police said in a statement to Fairfax Media: "We can say that we are planning an increased police presence." The NRL was forced to employ new protocols for the departure of match officials following the dramas, while there were an additional seven riot officers for Canterbury's next match at the venue.
Graham, in an effort to become less demonstrative and foster better relations with whistleblowers, has taken the unusual step of holding their hands behind their back during recent interactions. "People will say it's their way of expressing himself, their way of actually going 'You know what, I've got to be cautious that I don't get too brave with my hands'," Canterbury CEO Raelene Castle said. "There were a lot of lessons learnt all around and because of that you'll always see James address the referees in a different way." The Bulldogs are encouraging fans to dob in troublemakers by alerting security via text message at the first sign of problems. "That was a very clear message sent to all of our fans that it's unacceptable behaviour. If they see any of it they need to call it out," they said.
Castle said the recent history between the sides had elevated Rabbitohs-Bulldogs clashes to the same stratosphere as the famous Eels-Dogs rivalry of the 1980s. "It's fantastic, you need those," said Castle after the club hosted special Olympians at the fourth annual Mini Olympics at Belmore Sports Ground on Wednesday. "That is what sport is all about. In the '80s it was the Bulldogs and Parramatta and in the 2000s it's the Bulldogs and the Rabbits. Every game is important and both teams needing the two points makes it extra special." Josh Morris was inadvertently involved in many of the game's most controversial moments. The NSW three-quarter was placed on report for lashing out with their boot, but was subsequently cleared. They then appeared to be pushed out of the way when attempting to regather the ball from a short kick-off in the last play of the match.
"You could dwell on it a fair bit if you wanted to but it would have done us no good in the situation we were in," Morris said. "We had three or four injuries and two blokes on suspension after that game, there wasn't much time to dwell on it, it was just battle stations. We kept on getting wins when we had those blokes out ... "I think everyone hasn't forgotten that game and we've been looking forward to it since. It took a dent out of both sides, that one, with how physical it was. Obviously the aftermath with the injuries and suspensions kinda derailed both team's seasons for a little bit. "It certainly adds a bit of spice to this clash." Newcastle-bound halfback Trent Hodkinson predicted Graham and Klemmer would be on their best behaviour on Friday.
"Dessie [coach Des Hasler] will have them on a short leash this week," they quipped.
Brussels has said Iceland's entry into the EU is still on track despite strong signs many within the Nordic state remain fiercely opposed to joining the bloc.
Opening formal accession talks on Monday the European Commission dismissed accusations it was treating Iceland's membership more favourably than other aspiring EU countries.
Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said: “No one should feel like that because each and every accession process is unique, countries are judged on their merits. Iceland for 17 years has been part of European Economic area.”
The biggest hurdle to Icelandic EU entry continues to be finding a deal on fisheries. Many in Iceland fear full membership will open the country's waters to outside competition. Iceland's Foreign Minister Össur Skarphedinsson said other states would have to respect fishing quotas.
“We don't need any special exception. In this respect we need the rule of relative stability which really means that nations keep the respected part of their quotas,” they said.
Iceland applied for full EU membership following the collapse of its banking system in 2008.
Our correspondent Rafael Cereceda says: ‘‘The central stumbling block to Iceland's EU entry appears to be a deal on fisheries and whether the Icelandic people, who have shown a rebellious streak in the past, back moves to join the bloc. Reykjavic says that support from Iceland's voters will only be forthcoming if the agreed fisheries deal is good enough.'‘
While Season 2 of Westworld is still at least *a year* away (the showrunners have only just started writing the scrips) husband and wife duo Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy are happy to tease ONE thing thing about what we can expect when we return back to the maze. First things first: How do you feel about children's songs?
At the Westworld PaleyFest over the weekend, the showrunners and some of the cast took to the stage to tease what we can expect when HBO's epic show returns. While everyone was pretty tight lipped when it comes to plot points, Nolan and Joy were game to confess one thing that's made it into Season 2. And it's only made its way into Season 2 because it's made its way into their heads, and now we've got to suffer with it, too.
While talking about the music for the show — and that amazing player piano — Joy decided it was time to reveal one song that will appear in Season 2.
HBO
HBO
"I can give you a hint about [one of the songs]," they told the crowd. "At home we have a little girl—" "She's our little girl!" Nolan was quick to point out, so the crowd wouldn't start thinking that they've got, like, a young robotic Anthony Hopkins living with them. "So we spend a lot of time watching children's movies, and one of them has proven to be musically," Joy continued. "Like, incredibly inspiriting. So there may be a strange shoutout to a very kind of, innocent and joyful song that we will take a co-op and make dark and crazy. Just to traumatize our daughter."
Okay, IDK about you guys, but when I hear “incredibly inspiring” and “innocent and joyful” and “children's movie” the first thing that pops into mind is Frozen. It's the most song-heavy children's movie of the past few years, and if there's one movie on repeat in the Nolan-Joy house, this is a safe bet.
Could we really hear the Westworld player piano bust out “Let It Go?” We'll find out in [long, low wail] 2018.
In March of 2011, when I published a book about Ween as part of the 33 1/3 series, it seemed as though the band would go on forever. At that point, core members Aaron Freeman and Mickey Melchiondo — Gene and Dean Ween, respectively — hadn't put out a new record since 2007's La Cucaracha, and Freeman had freaked out fans with a blotto anti-performance at a Vancouver show two months earlier, but as any Ween devotee could attest, such speed bumps were a familiar feature of the New Hope, PA duo's two-decade-plus cruise. The reasonable assumption was that Freeman would take some time to cool off, as they had after a canceled 2004 tour, and Ween would eventually reemerge with another string of triumphant three-hour gigs and brilliantly offbeat LPs.
Except it didn't happen that way. Ween did eventually return to the road, playing select festivals and one-offs through the end of 2011, but this past January brought news of Marvelous Clouds, a Freeman solo record featuring material by the poet-songwriter Rod McKuen. Once the publicity cycle for that album kicked in, things started getting weird. In May, Freeman called The Onion from rehab, stating that they were “ready to put [Ween] on the back burner.” Later that month, they made a definitive proclamation to Rolling Stone: “I'm retiring Gene Ween.” Disbelief and increasingly sordid online infighting ensued, and as the situation currently stands, it appears that the Freeman/Melchiondo partnership is no more.
It's a grim moment to be a Ween fan, but it's as good a time as any to assess the band's legacy: Pure Guava, Ween's major-label debut and the album that spawned their biggest hit, the Beavis and Butt-head–mocked “Push th' Little Daisies,” turns 20 tomorrow, November 15. The loss of Ween as a live entity is tragic, to be sure, but the band's discography is rock solid. From their humble inception — two middle-school buddies spreading the gospel of an invented deity called the Boognish — to their late-career status as one of pop's most beloved cult bands, they never stopped honing their craft. There are no redundant Ween records; Freeman and Melchiondo told us something new with every album, from the sprawling 4-track mindfuck that is The Pod to the relatively tidy genre experiment 12 Golden Country Greats and the depressive psychedelic masterpiece Quebec. (The nine proper albums and one outtakes collection counted down here aren't even the half of it; completists will happily fill you in on the truckload of self-released cassettes, live albums, B-sides and assorted other rarities — including the 1999 fan-appreciation comp, Craters Of The Sac, viewed by some as a bona fide LP — that round out the Ween oeuvre.) Even as they matured, Ween never stopped sending mixed signals, juxtaposing silliness and sincerity: Balancing out every stoner's lark in their catalog is a perfect pop song.
It sounds corny, but you can think of this round-up as a tribute to musical buddyhood. “A friend's a friend who knows what being a friend is,” Freeman sang on La Cucaracha's “Friends,” and in its own way, the track — and the band's entire body of work — is an expression of a collaborative ideal: two all-but-blood brothers uniting in the name of homegrown art. Sure, Lennon and McCartney's relationship soured along the way, but there's something comforting about that iconic joint songwriting credit, as if they never stopped longing for that kind of creative unity even after it unraveled. The same goes for Freeman and Melchiondo. Even as they trade barbs, they're each taking pains to acknowledge the depth of their bond. “What Aaron and I created together was something so special that everyone that was even close to it for even one evening was affected forever,” Melchiondo wrote in the Ween forum this past September. “Nothing can ever change that.” Can I get an amen?

"Loan forgiveness creates incentives for students to borrow too much to attend college, potentially contributing to rising college prices for everyone," is a study's warning over government plans that allow students to rack up big debts and then forgive the unpaid balance after a set period. As WSJ reports, enrollment in student debt forgiveness plans have surged nearly 40% in just six months, to include at least 1.3 million Americans owing around $72 billion. The administration is looking to cap debt eligible for forgiveness, as President Obama's revamped Pay As You Earn scheme has seen applications soar and is estimated to cost taxpayers $14bn a year. The 'popularity' of the student loan bailout plan surged after Obama promoted it in 2012, and now the administration must back-track as costs have massively outpaced government predictions.
We have been aggresively focused on the government's blowing of the student loan bubble...
Student debt has nearly doubled since 2007 to $1.1 trillion, disproportionately driven by the growth in graduate-school debt.
And questioned the need to incur such massive credit-fueled costs of tuition only to gain a low-paying job...
there is no point in trying to preserve the old regime. Today's emphasis on measuring college education in terms of future earnings and employability may strike some as philistine, but most students have little choice. When you could pay your way through college by waiting tables, the idea that you should "study what interests you" was more viable than it is today, when the cost of a four-year degree often runs to six figures. For an 18-year-old, investing such a sum in an education without a payoff makes no more sense than buying a Ferrari on credit.
And while government plans are nothing new, Obama has aggressively promoted them...
The government has offered some form of income-based repayment since the early 1990s, but few studentsfound the terms enticing. But in 2007, Congress allowed borrowers working in nonprofit and government jobs to have unpaid debt forgiven after 10 years, and cut monthly payments for new borrowers to 15% of discretionary income. In 2010, it cut those payments to 10% for borrowers who took out loans from 2014. A year later, Mr. Obama, through executive action, moved up the date when borrowers could qualify for the new terms, creating a program for those who took out loans from 2011. The White House this year has proposed making the program available to all student borrowers, regardless of when they signed their loans. The popularity of the programs surged after the Obama administration began to promote them, starting in 2012, on the Internet and later through email to borrowers.
And it seems they are ripe for abuse...
"Income-based repayment can be a way for students responsibly to manage debt, but it should not be a bailout for students who borrow too much or for schools who charge too much," said Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the Senate Education Committee.
But, as usual, the government screwed up...
The plans' long-term costs have greatly outpaced the government's predictions. In the last fiscal year, debt absorbed by the repayment plans from the most widely used student-loan program—Stafford loans—exceeded government expectations from a year earlier by 90%. ... A report Monday last week from the Brookings Institution, a centrist think tank, offered one of the few preliminary examinations of the programs' impact. The most popular plan could cost taxpayers $14 billion a year if it becomes available to all borrowers as Mr. Obama has proposed, while fueling tuition inflation, it said. "Loan forgiveness creates incentives for students to borrow too much to attend college, potentially contributing to rising college prices for everyone," the study said. The authors recommend scrapping the forgiveness provisions.
Sure enough everyone piled in looking for their handout...
Enrollment in the plans—which allow students to rack up big debts and then forgive the unpaid balance after a set period—has surged nearly 40% in just six months, to include at least 1.3 million Americans owing around $72 billion, U.S. Education Department records show. Which means costs are soaring and the administration feels the need to do something to fix what it had broken by intervening once again... The Obama administration has proposed in its latest budget released last month to cap debt eligible for forgiveness at $57,500 per student. There is currently no limit on such debt. The move reflects concerns in the administration not just about the hit to the government, but over the risk that promising huge debt forgiveness could make borrowers and schools less disciplined about costs. Colleges might charge more than they would otherwise, leading students to borrow more.
And so is the government about to pop the student loan bubble by spoiling a good thing - unlimited debt forgiveness - for students and trickling down that credit tightening impact on colleges only too happy to raise tuition costs to reflect the credit-forgiveness-adjusted amount of money on the table?

The Macintosh Endgame
Jean-Louis Gassée Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 27, 2016
by Jean-Louis Gassée
The Macintosh line of personal computers will soon be 32 years old. It has a venerable past… but what kind of future does it have in a declining market?
On the surface the Mac appears to be thriving. If ‘Macintosh Inc.' were an independent company, its $22.8B in revenue for Apple's 2016 accounting year (which ended in September) would rank 123rd on the Fortune 500 list, not far below the likes of Time Warner, Halliburton, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon:
But there's more to the Mac's future than its current good numbers. After enjoying a good time in the sun, the Mac is on the same downward slope as the rest of the PC market.
What do you do when your business is part of a declining world? Do you decrease prices to gain market share? Bad idea, this is the PC clone makers' race to the bottom, a game in which everyone loses as products become commoditized, undifferentiated, and, ultimately, worthless. This is what Hewlett-Packard did when it bundled its PCs and printers (another commoditized product category) into a new entity called HP, Inc…. and then discreetly placed the business out by the curb. Recent numbers show a measly 4.3% Operating Profit for HP's PC line. Comparable (not disclosed) Mac numbers are said to be in the 25% or more range.
Instead of racing to the bottom as the market plummets, Apple appears to be taking the “high road”, in a sense: They're taking refuge at the high end of the market by introducing new, more expensive MacBook Pros, with a visible differentiating feature, the Touch Bar. This is known, inelegantly, as milking a declining business, although you shouldn't expect Apple to put it that way.
Apple's recognition that the PC market is declining also explains why the company has been slow in updating its laptops and desktops. The iPhone, with $136B in revenue for 2016, is a much higher priority and gets more development resources. In a war, the top general puts more and better troops on the most important battle.
Will the PC category keep declining until it disappears? It happened to the MP3 Player genre: In 2006, the year before the Jesus Phone, the iPod generated more revenue than the Mac, but it was ultimately absorbed into Apple's new creation.
Many thought something similar would happen with the iPad and the Mac. “Someday, the iPad will replace the Mac!” was a common belief supported by the iPad's meteoric rise. Indeed, by 2014, iPad revenue ($30B) had surpassed the Mac ($24B), but after three years of growth, iPad revenues went South and soon fell below Mac numbers. In 2016, the iPad only brought $20.6B against the Mac's $22.8B.
For the Mac versus iPad question, Apple execs offer a clean dichotomy.
On one side, we have the Mac with a vertical screen and a keyboard+touchpad for input. Your never have to raise your hand. The Touch Bar is an extension of that interaction model. The trackpad, now even larger on new models, provides one, two, three or even four-finger inputs with very fine cursor control.
On the other, we have the intuitive iPad with its simple user interface driven by fingers directly on the screen. Oh, and the Pro versions offer a keyboard and a stylus, pardon, Pencil. And it exposes the file system via the iCloud Drive app that also lets you see your Mac desktop and documents. And the Split View feature lets you open two windows and run two apps side by side on your tablet.
To an uninformed observer, the dichotomy isn't so clean: The iPad looks likes its turning into the hybrid PC-tablet interaction model promoted by Microsoft Surface devices. Microsoft contends that the Surface hybrid, now in its fourth iteration, is the best-of-both-worlds that their customers want. Apple maintains that the Microsoft implementation is kludgy, that traditional Windows Office apps were designed for the fine cursor control afforded by a mouse, not for the much coarser touch area of a finger.
(In discussing its latest quarterly results, Microsoft pegged Surface devices numbers at $926M, about $4.4B for the last four quarters. Again, the Mac and iPad boasted $20B+ each for the same time period. A difficult comparison between different product philosophies.)
The story doesn't get simpler: What if, in a not-too-distant future, Apple introduces an iPad with a keyboard and a pixel-precise trackpad? Perhaps not as large and capable as the one on Mac laptops, but a trackpad nonetheless. The increasingly blurry difference between an Apple PC and an Apple tablet could become even less clear.
And still there's more.
I write this on a MacBook running on a 1.2GHz Intel processor. (It's the best laptop I've ever owned, small, great "Retina" screen for my old eyes, light as a 12.9" iPad Pro and its cover.) My iPhone 7+, which I sometimes use as a cellular modem for my MacBook, runs on a 2.34 GHz A10 processor that is, in many respects, more muscular than my Macbook's CPU.
This is becoming ridiculous and inevitably raises another version of the Mac vs. iPad question. In a fantasy world, Apple produces an Ax-based Mac. Easy enough as the company controls its silicon and software tools, and the organs that are common to iOS and macOS already run on both ARM and Intel CPUs. But what would an Ax Mac mean in the real world, to software developers? The mind reels at the thought of yet another upheaval as developers rush to convert third-party Mac apps.
Or will they? With hundreds of millions of iOS devices sold year after year, and ever more software engineering resources allocated to the platform, iOS-based hardware will win the day. The billion dollar question, here, is when? As Horace Dediu a.k.a. @asymco put it in a June 2014 tweet:
In the end, iOS numbers make the decision. For its part, Apple will stay out of the way and let customers — and developers — decide when it's time to buy the last Mac.
______________________________
PS: I'm not ignoring the new MacBook Pros. I'll let the clickbait dust settle first and deal with the new laptops, and their perplexing launch, once I've had the opportunity to own and operate one. Today, MacBook Pros still look like they're made of a rare metal called unobtainium. The Palo Alto Apple Store says I can pick one up on January 2nd — 2017.

Of the 21 species of orchids Thoreau observed in Concord, “we could only find 7,” Dr. Primack said.
From 1851 through 1858, Thoreau tracked the first flowerings of perhaps 500 species, Dr. Primack said. “He knew what they were doing, and they did it really systematically.”
Dr. Primack and Dr. Miller-Rushing did their own surveys in 2004, 2005 and 2006. They also consulted notes from Pennie Logemann, a landscape designer who tracked flowering times from 1963 to 1993 as an aid to planning Concord gardens. And they looked at contributions by members of area plant, insect and bird clubs and the work of additional participants in Concord's long line of passionate amateur naturalists, some of whose records are preserved in the Free Public Library here.

One of them, Richard J. Eaton, is best known to botanists for their 1974 book, “A Flora of Concord.” Dr. Primack recalled that as a graduate student at Harvard, they had worked alongside Mr. Eaton in the university's natural history collection — curators relegated the two of them to the same obscure table. “He was just this very elderly man,” Dr. Primack recalled. “Not a professor, an enthusiast. But they were a very, very good botanist. They used very good methods.”
Another contributor, Alfred Hosmer, is more obscure, but their contribution is enormous: detailed notes they made in Concord from 1888 through 1902.
“He was a storekeeper,” Dr. Primack told a small group of graduate students as they gathered them around a table in a special collections room in the Concord library one recent morning. They opened a gray cardboard box, sifted through photocopies of Thoreau's notoriously hard-to-read notes and pulled out what looked like an ancient composition book. They turned to a page where an inventory of orchid species ended and one of irises began. The entries move across the page in tiny but precise script.
“You can imagine this as a storekeeper's ledger,” Dr. Primack said. But Hosmer's plant nomenclature was more accurate than Thoreau's, they said. “Plus we can read their writing.”

According to Dr. Primack, Hosmer spent “15 years walking around Concord for several hours a day several times a week” making notes about plants. “He never wrote about why they were doing this,” Dr. Primack said, “but they had known Thoreau when they were a boy. Hosmer was one of the first people who said Thoreau was a genius and not just a nut.”
Dr. Primack said they had never heard of Hosmer until their interest in Thoreau led them to search for old journals, diaries and other records. “I started going to all these funny scientific societies we have,” they said. “I was getting up in the ‘new business' and telling people what I was looking for. I got a lot of leads, but most were not very useful. Then Ray Angelo told me about Hosmer.”

Mr. Angelo, who stepped down recently as curator of vascular plants at the New England Botanical Club, is the author of a monograph, “Concord Area Trees and Shrubs.” The eminent biologist Ernst Mayr once called them “the most knowledgeable student of the Concord flora” and today, when Dr. Primack and the other researchers are looking for this species or that in Concord, Mr. Angelo tells them where to find it.
The most daunting challenge, though, was making sense of this kind of data.
“There were a couple of big problems,” Dr. Miller-Rushing, now at the University of Maryland, said in a telephone interview from Colorado, where they were studying mountain plants. “Thoreau had incredibly messy handwriting. That was a big difficulty.” Also, they said, “in some cases they and Hosmer called the same species by different names. We had to figure all that out.”
Their work with Dr. Davis and their students began then, after they heard the two give talks at Harvard on their efforts and convinced them additional analysis was necessary.
Photo
“We just treated each individual species as a data point,” Dr. Primack said. “That was not the way to do it.” Dr. Davis and two of their graduate students, Charles G. Willis and Brad Ruhfel, began looking at the species data from an evolutionary perspective including, for example, the relationship between species traits and abundance. “Those species that are falling out are more closely related than you would expect,” Mr. Willis said.
As Dr. Davis put it, “certain branches of the tree of life are being lopped off.”
But when Dr. Davis and their colleagues began analyzing the data, things got off to a rough start. “It's actually a very specialized kind of analysis,” Dr. Primack said. Mr. Willis “kept explaining what the analysis was showing, and I kept saying, ‘I don't understand.' ”
Once they did understand, they added, it became apparent that “a couple of times they had not done the analysis correctly because they did not understand the field data.”
Now, though, they have figured out how to communicate. “Climate change, ecology and evolutionary biology have been going their own separate ways,” Mr. Ruhfel said. “We see now we have information we can share and really further the field.”
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
Now the professors and their graduate students are on the trail of more data. For example, there is growing evidence that as birds change their migration patterns in response to climate change, they may no longer be in sync with the insect species they feed on. Elizabeth Bacon, another of Dr. Primack's graduate students, is combing Thoreau's notes on birds and the records of the Nuttall Ornithological Club, a local organization, to see what they can contribute.
Dr. Miller-Rushing worked this summer in the Rockies on whether plants that begin to flower earlier have more problems with late-season frost.
Mr. Willis and Mr. Ruhfel are looking at which species are moving in to Concord to occupy niches vacated by vanished plants, and whether they come from “adjacent species pools,” as Mr. Willis puts it.
The scientists say their research demonstrates the importance of simply watching the landscape and recording what occurs in it. And it demonstrates the importance of old records and natural history collections, Dr. Davis said. But in general, they said, there is little interest in devoting money, time and space to their preservation.
“It's hard to defend the space on major campuses,” Dr. Davis said. “Eaton could not have prepared their ‘Flora' unless Harvard University had maintained herbarium specimens. Hosmer's book was here in Concord for 100 years before anyone used it.”
Sender of the world's first SMS.
Hi, I'm Neil Papworth. I was born and raised in Reading, UK. I studied computing and started my career at Ferranti International in Bracknell, designing and programming a movable vehicle satellite antenna and implementing software for automated helicopter landing aids.
In 1991, I moved to Sema Group Telecoms, and it's with them that on December 3rd, 1992, I sent the world's first ever text message. I was part of the team developing a Short Message Service Centre (SMSC) for our customer, Vodafone UK, and was chosen to go to their Newbury site to install, integrate and test the software and get it all working. Initially the idea was for them to use it essentially as a paging service - no-one had any idea how gigantic the texting phenomenon would become.
Since mobile phones didn't yet have keyboards, I typed the message out on a PC. It read, "Merry Christmas," and I sent it to Richard Jarvis of Vodafone, who was enjoying their office Christmas party at the time.
I remained with Sema Group and its successors (SchlumbergerSema, Airwide Solutions) for many years as a software developer, then a designer, and later a product architect, living and working all over the world, from Singapore and Sydney to Seattle and Toronto. Texting didn't really take off until some years later, once handsets were able to both send and receive and people could send SMS to their friends on different networks. The first media attention I remember the event receiving was when the BBC News website marked the 10th anniversary of the first text. Since then, I've given radio interviews, been flown to London with my family for a movie premiere, featured in a Super Bowl ad, been an answer to a Jeopardy question and had articles written on the achievement in newspapers from The Sun to the Times of India and the Montreal Gazette.
I now live in Montreal with my wife and three kids and work as a software architect for Oracle on their subscriber database solutions. I follow Formula 1 racing and the latest developments in science and technology, and I enjoy travel, beer and curry*!

* When the giant horror Typhon descended upon Mount Olympus, two fish guided Aphrodite and Eros through the churning waters and helped them escape to safety. These fish were raised to the heavens and became the constellation Pisces, and there they have remained until the cries of the innocents across Newerth compelled them to return. This time, however, they will not simply guide fleeing refugees to safety-they will harness the unstoppable power of water and use it to drown the monsters who threaten god and man.

I think Trump is amazing. I mean it. I don't think they were ever trained in mentalism or any kind of magic for that matter — they have far too much ego to accept instruction — but I am impressed by their mastery of the magician's use of language. Unfortunately for him, like a magician on stage 24 hours a day, he'll eventually be caught. All it takes is them choosing to lie under the most unfortunate circumstances, like denying something said under suspicious circumstances. Even if they were innocent on that occasion, the morass of corruption they surround themselves with will cease to be circumstantial and he'll get in trouble over it.
Trump has the best words. Like a magician.
As a magician, I am used to fabricating lies. Mine are of course intended to entertain, not to harm. The methods I use are similar in that their underlying principles are the same as those used by con artists and other professional criminals who rely on deception. All lies rely on the same premises to be effective, so as a magician I am uniquely qualified to speak on the subject of lies, in this case ones told by the Trump administration. They have methods, and they have purposes.
Methods
The best methods involve starting from a premise the audience believes and linking it to the lie: if this, then that. This is the method most often used in politics because if the lie is confronted, the liar can use the fact as a straw man (“You're saying the sky isn't blue?”)
Another commonly used method is covering one lie with another one. Specifically, one says something that isn't true and wants the audience to believe, then a second, much bigger lie no one will believe, so that it gets torn down and the lie that matters stands. This is a misdirecting lie, and Trump favors these.
Repetition is a method used to make a lie plausible. In advertising, often the goal is not to demonstrate the dynamic capabilities of a product, but rather its brand alone. Familiarity makes people likely to buy. By repeating a statement, even a false one, it seems truer. Trump used to be a name associated with low income housing, but by Donald branding every luxury product they could put their name on, now the Trump brand stands for vulgar luxury. Another related technique is saying that the statement itself can be attributed to another author, an appeal to authority, in which the liar's credibility such as it is is multiplied by the perception that the other source is credible, and if the source turns out not to be credible, the liar can say they were just trusting what they heard, “on the internet” for example.
A third method of lying is what the Nazis called “The Big Lie”. The Big Lie is a lie you tell so often, so colorfully, and in such a variety of media, that its prevalence suggests its veracity. It is a type of repetition so egregious it deserves its own category. This can be as innocuous as “Don't drink coffee, it'll stunt your growth” (not true, by the way) or as insidious as “Obama was born in Kenya.”
Gaslighting is another tactic often used by liars, which involves making the listener believe they are an unreliable witness, and doubt the evidence contradicting the lie. This is often used by domestic abusers, and Kellyanne “Alternative Facts” Conway. A recent example is Trump's new assessment of NATO. Having previously said it was obsolete, they now say it has changed and is no longer obsolete. For the record, NATO has not changed.
Smokescreen is when you throw so much information at someone, they cannot absorb it all, and therefore cannot verify everything. This means some things will go unchallenged, and can then be held up as statements that went unchallenged, lending to the perception of their veracity. This is a bit like how Fox set up a hotline for reporting sexual harassment, and then held up its inactivity as evidence that no one had been harassed.
Finally, the method that Trump often uses to tie the others together:
Leaving blanks is when you tell a story that sort of makes sense, but is missing some key details that would tell the complete story. People are wired to fill in the blanks whether they were left intentionally or we simply forgot some information, so if the listener doesn't expect a lie, or doesn't expect this type of lie, the listener will fill in the blanks with the necessary “facts” that explain why the lie is true.
This lie does something very interesting: it leaves the construction of the lie up to the listener. If I were to say a bunch of facts, and then an opinion, the facts may not necessarily support the pattern: A, B, D, E, and F are the first letters of the alphabet. The listener, when asked later, may fill in the letter C because it makes sense, but it's not what I said, so if I am pressed on the story I can honestly say I didn't say the letter C. If I were President and I had just invaded a country, and landed a jet fighter on an aircraft carrier in front of a banner reading “mission accomplished” written in the same font as all official White House materials at the time, I wouldn't have to say that we won the war; it would be strongly implied. Good thing that never happened…
A good liar will pepper blanks into their lies, which, like a cold read, will leave the protection of the lie up to the person being lied to. This is the most insidious kind of lie.
Human beings are wired to recognize patterns, which is why we can, as a species, read between the lines. Try reading between these lines:
“His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being — you know, shot. … I mean, what was they doing — what was they doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death? Before the shooting?”
That's Trump implying that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination. They never says it, but their words suggest it. The only bad thing we can completely prove Rafael Cruz was involved in was producing Ted Cruz.
Sounds believable? That was a lie. Rafael did plenty of bad things besides making baby Ted. See? Lying is easy.
Do these sorts of lies sound like Trump? They should.
Dog owners who fail to clean up after their pets have today been warned that they could face fines of up to €4,000.
Limerick City and County Council and An Garda Síochána have launched a joint campaign aimed at encouraging dog owners to clean up after their animals who foul in public areas.
Environmental wardens and gardaí will be out in force over the coming weeks speaking to dog walkers, advising them to carry poo bags, distributing bags if necessary, and delivering the message that failure to clean up after a dog is an offence under the Litter Pollution Act.
Garda David O'Connell commented: "An Garda Síochána is happy to work with the local authority to promote the message that allowing your dog to foul in a public area and then not picking it up is simply unacceptable.
"Failing to clean up after your dog is the same as littering and is an offence under the Litter Pollution Acts. If you do not clean up after your dog you could face an on-the-spot fine of €150 or up to a maximum fine of €4,000 in court for each offence. I would encourage dog owners and walkers to comply with the law and clean up after their animals."
Mairead O'Donovan, an administrative Officer with the Council's Environment Department, said: "Dog waste is not only a nuisance but can carry diseases which can be harmful to humans. The message the Council and An Garda Síochána are promoting is simple; always carry a bag to clean up after your dog. There are now a wide range of options available to dog owners for cleaning up after their dogs."
"Pooper scoop bags are available in supermarkets, pet shops and in some of the euro/deal shops. Dog litter bags can be bought as cheaply as €1.00 for 100. People may also use nappy sacks, reused plastic bags or something similar. Limerick City and County Council provides bags to dog walkers in public parks, have installed a number of dispensers in parks around Limerick."
The launch of the new campaign was attended by representatives of Limerick City and County Council and An Garda Síochána, as well as Maggie the dog from My Canine Companions, which provides highly trained and skilled service dogs to people with disabilities.

Bill Maher: "Europe has been real assholes about Israel. I mean, in general. The U.N., as of 2015, the United Nations Human Rights Council had issued more official condemnations of Israel than the rest of the world's nations combined. I wonder now that Europe has been attacked four times now in a little over a year, and they say ISIS has 400 fighters that they are ready to introduce back into Europe, and they're trying to get a dirty bomb. Maybe Europe will have a little more sympathy for what Israel goes through."

On Thursday, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia signed a defense cooperation agreement (DCA) – the first of its kind – between the two of them. The agreement was signed by Saudi Deputy Defense Minister Prince Salman bin Sultan Abdulaziz Al Saud and Indonesian Lt. Gen. (ret.) Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin. The DCA covers training, education, counter-terrorism, and defense industry cooperation.
The agreement is significant for Indonesia in a few ways. It is the first agreement of its sort that Indonesia has signed with a Middle Eastern country and the first between it and Saudi Arabia – the two countries have had diplomatic relations since 1950. Lt. Gen. Sjafrie told the Jakarta Post that “This is the first time a Saudi deputy defense minister has visited Indonesia.”
The cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Indonesia is underscored by both nations' common Islamic identities, although this wasn't a driving factor in the signing of the DCA. In fact, both Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, in agreeing to cooperate on counterterrorism, noted that terrorism should not be linked to any ideology or religion, in particular Islam. Indonesia's interlocutor adds that “No religion in the world teaches violence.”
The Indonesia Defense Ministry said in a press release that terrorist incidents in recent years have cast a poor light on Islam and that Saudi Arabia is one of the countries most damaged by terrorism. Indonesia has also suffered terrorist attacks conducted by Islamist groups.
An Indonesia-Saudi Arabia joint exercise on counterterrorism will follow from the DCA. According to Sjafrie, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia “have agreed to fight terrorism by holding joint exercises [that involve] members of both countries' special forces.”
Indonesia's defense industry could also win lucrative Saudi contracts in the future. Saudi Arabia has put in a request for detailed technical specifications of Indonesian defense equipment and will match Indonesian offerings to its requirements. According to Sjafrie, “The assessment is at the observation phase. Today's visit was an introduction to the Indonesian defense industry's capability.” It appears likely that Saudi Arabia will ultimately purchase indigenous Indonesian defense hardware in the future.
For Saudi Arabia, the DCA with Indonesia comes on the heels of a similar deal with Pakistan – both deals highlight the Kingdom's interest in expanding relations with Islamic nations outside its immediate Middle Eastern neighborhood. The deal with Pakistan came two days prior to the Indonesian deal, and as The Diplomat reported, may involve the purchase of joint China-Pakistan developed JF-17 fighter jets.
A set of three revised routes — none of which pass through the city of Santa Clarita — for the Palmdale to Burbank section of the California High-Speed Rail Project was released on Tuesday.
The three proposed routes, dubbed Refined SR-14, Refined E1 and Refined E2, were developed “as a result of continued engineering and environmental technical evaluation,” according to a news release.
Refined SR-14 would run the closest to Santa Clarita, running along Highway 14, and would affect the communities of Agua Dulce, Acton, Sylmar, San Fernando and Pacoima, among others, before arriving at the planned station at the Burbank Airport.
Refined E1 and Refined E2 would mainly tunnel through the San Gabriel Mountains, east of Santa Clarita.
According to a news release, the routes were revised in an effort to:
Reduce and largely avoid environmental justice impacts in the highly-populated communities of Santa Clarita, Sylmar, San Fernando and Pacoima.
Reduce impacts in the Santa Clarita area.
Improve future high-speed rail operations on all the alignments under study by making them less circuitous, thus allowing for more efficient, quicker service.
Improve the constructability of all the alignments under study by decreasing the amount of technically challenging infrastructure.
These three revised routes will be detailed in a Supplemental Alternatives Analysis, or SAA, Report before being presented to the California High-Speed Rail Authority Board of Directors at the monthly meeting on April 12.
The meeting is scheduled to be held at the Anaheim Convention Center, located at 800 West Katella Avenue in Anaheim.
The SAA will include details about the three alignment alternatives, and the environmental, technical and feasibility factors that went into these changes.
The report will also review how the route affects, or avoids impacting, the Angeles National Forest, designated wilderness areas and the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument.
“The Palmdale to Burbank Project Section is currently in the environmental and engineering study phase and is working toward the release of a draft environmental document in 2017,” according to a news release.

“It is a fact so familiar that we seldom remember how very strange it is,” the historian George N. Clark wrote in 1932, “that the commonest phrases we hear used about civilization at the present time all relate to the possibility, or even the prospect, of its being destroyed.” In “The Twilight Years,” their thought-­provoking and illuminating new study of the interwar period, Richard Overy contends that before 1914 the British believed they had conquered the world and would rule it forever. After World War I, a wrecked generation had to pick up the pieces of that world and ask what went wrong. It is this process that occupies the book, which successfully adopts a broad-brush approach to cultural life without obscuring gemlike details. During the 1920s and '30s, Britain saw itself as a civilization in crisis, facing the ominous dawn of a new Dark Age.
If this feels familiar, Overy is not surprised. “For some years now,” they write, “there has existed a popular belief that the Western world faces a profound crisis.” A professor of modern history at the University of Exeter, Overy argues rather sternly that, in fact, the West today enjoys a far more secure and wealthier way of life than at any point in history. By contrast, during the interwar years the British — then occupying a position approximately analogous to modern Americans in terms of global influence and responsibility — had indisputable cause for fear. Nearly a million British subjects were killed during World War I, and soon afterward fissures began to show in the empire. At the beginning of the '30s, the world faced a serious financial downturn, and the rise of new and deadly forms of political extremism. When Hitler came to power in 1933, Britain, France and Spain were, as Overy points out, the only major democracies left in Europe.
Skeptic though they may be about equating interwar Britain with the modern United States, Overy is clearly tickled by the parallels.  They are too sophisticated a historian to belabor them, but from a chapter entitled “The Death of Capitalism” to their account of the self-proclaimed agents of morality attempting to “cure” homosexuality, there is plenty here that strikes a chord. On that supposed cure, the editor of the prestigious medical journal The Lancet was convinced that proper treatment could turn any homosexual into “quite a cheerful citizen” — though it is hard to imagine many of the unfortunate subjects being cheered up by the combination of vigorous exercise and cold baths they prescribed.
The economy of the early 1930s was, as John Maynard Keynes put it, in “a frightful muddle,” and capitalism itself was increasingly seen to be riddled with flaws. Debate raged about whether it should be reformed or junked. “The signposts of economic and social evolution point inevitably from capitalism to socialism and communism,” the young economist Maurice Dobb wrote. They became a prominent intellectual, accepting a position at Trinity College, Cambridge: as Overy acidly notes, “the college tolerated their Marxism and he, evidently, tolerated its opulence.”

Dobb was unusual. Though a more moderate socialism did come to hold political sway in Britain, the nation consistently rejected the extremist politics that swamped the rest of Europe. Even at the outbreak of World War II, Communist and fascist parties counted their combined memberships at around 40,000 — less than one percent of the population — and few of those were active. In 1933, Wyndham Lewis's sympathetic biography of the new German chancellor, Adolf Hitler, was displayed in a famous bookshop on London's Charing Cross Road. Twice a day, the window had to be hosed down to remove all the accumulated spittle.

A student union officer who banned white people and men from an event promoting equality has claimed they "cannot be racist" because they are an ethnic minority woman.
Goldsmiths University's student union welfare and diversity officer Bahar Mustafa sparked a backlash when they told white people and men they should not attend an event on "diversifying the curriculum".
They wrote on Facebook: “Invite loads of BME Women and non-binary people!! Also, if you've been invited and you're a man and/or white PLEASE DON'T COME just cos I invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME woman and non-binary event only.”
Them comments were branded "laughable" and "patronising" by fellow students.
And Goldsmiths University said it had written to the union to "express concern" at the comments, and added: "We are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression, including racism, sexism or any other form of bigotry.”
But Ms Mustafa, 27, has hit back in the row, describing the backlash over their Facebook post as "only one in a series of attacks upon minority women on campus.”
In a statement read out to fellow students, they accused the media of embarking on a "witch hunt and shameful character assassination".
They said: "There have been charges laid against me that I am racist and sexist towards white men.
"I, an ethnic minority woman, cannot be racist or sexist towards white men, because racism and sexism describe structures of privilege based on race and gender.
"Therefore, women of colour and minority genders cannot be racist or sexist, since we do not stand to benefit from such a system.”
In a seven-minute statement, they also accused people who "benefit from white supremacy" of "clinging on" to power and added: "We are not going down without as fight."
They said: "Reverse racism and reverse sexism are not real.
"We will not be silenced; we are militant. The world is not ready for minorities to challenge the status quo, but resistance to our resistance is futile."
Them speech drew applause from a crowd of students gathered at an event at Goldsmith's in New Cross last week.
The student's union had previously said it was reviewing how it communicates with people to "avoid any future misunderstandings" after the backlash over Ms Mustafa's comments ahead of the scheduled event in April.
It added: “Challenging societal inequality has been at the core of our campaigns and we try to do this pro-actively in our everyday work, so the accusation that we discriminate is one we refute wholeheartedly.”
Mayor Rob Ford's future as mayor — or ex-mayor — will be determined in a Toronto courtroom on Monday.
Ford plans to attend the proceedings but wouldn't comment further when pressed by reporters Friday at Earl Bales Park in North York, where the mayor participated in the opening of a new $2.3 million chair lift at the ski hill.
“I'll be in court on Monday,” Ford said. “I can just say I'm going to be there and unfortunately I can't comment on the appeal.”
If they were to lose the appeal, Ford waffled over whether they would prefer holding a mayoral by-election or whether they would urge council to appoint them as mayor until the next scheduled election in October, 2014.
Ford said he'll run in a byelection — costing $7 million or more — if council decides to go that route. They have also indicated they would want council to appoint him.
Asked Friday about their support for an appointment, Ford adopted a more neutral stance.
“If that's what council decides, that's what they decide. Obviously, that would save a lot of money. If they don't decide to do that, then they would have a byelection. Whatever council wants to decide, but let's just see what happens with the appeal first.”
Ford's lawyer Alan Lenczner will try to persuade a panel of three Divisional Court judges to overturn a bombshell November ruling that Ford breached provincial conflict of interest law at a February city council meeting and must vacate their office.
A court official said Friday the appeal panel will be: Regional Senior Justice Edward Then; Justice Lynne Leitch; and Justice Katherine Swinton.
To save Ford's job, Lenczner must convince them that Superior Court Justice Charles Hackland made an error in law. In a factum filed last month, Lenczner argues Hackland made four of them.
Clayton Ruby, the lawyer acting for Toronto resident Paul Magder who successfully launched the conflict of interest suit and grilled Ford in court for hours, will try to convince the panel the ruling should stand.
Lenczner has predicted Ford — and the rest of the city — will wait about three weeks before the appeal court releases its decision.
If Ford wins, they remain mayor.
If they lose, they are out of office. Deputy Mayor Doug Holyday would take over temporarily and councillors would have to vote on whether to select the next mayor through a council vote appointing a caretaker to fulfill Ford's term — potentially Ford themselves — or to launch a mayoral byelection.

The Centre is likely to tell the Supreme Court that the Union Home Ministry's instructions to states and Union territories on migrant deportation is for all undocumented refugees staying in India, not just Rohingyas. The Supreme Court had sought the stand of the government on a petition challenging the ministry's directions to deport illegal Rohingya immigrants, who are mostly Muslims, back to Myanmar.
Advertising
The matter, being heard before a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, is likely to be taken up on September 11 when the Centre is expected to file its reply, said officials. The home ministry, sources said, is unlikely to give any undertaking to either stop deportation of illegal migrants or dismantle the task force to identify illegal migrants, set up in states on its directions. The government may provide data on illegal migrants to support its argument before the apex court and reiterate its position that illegal migrants infringe on the rights of citizens, added officials.
According to the home ministry's estimates, there are nearly 40,000 Rohingyas across India with the highest number in Jammu and Kashmir. Of this, 11,000 are said to be registered with the UNHCR. The number of illegal migrants from Bangladesh is said to be over 2 crore, officials said. The plea before the Supreme Court, filed by Rohingyas Mohammad Salimullah and Mohammad Shaqir, who are registered refugees under the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), claimed they had taken shelter in India after escaping Myanmar where they face widespread discrimination, violence and bloodshed.
“We have been providing relief and rehabilitation to refugees from Tibet, Tamilians from Sri Lanka. However, in the cases of illegal migrants from Bangladesh, Myanmar, it has been noticed that they are using means to get ration cards, Aadhaar cards and voter identity cards which may lead to change in demographic pattern in the country,” a senior official said.

The Centre is also likely to argue that this is not the first time that the home ministry has taken a stand on deportation of illegal migrants. “There are longstanding instructions issued earlier by the government against illegal Bangladesh migrants,” officials added. The officials said Rohingyas who have valid documents, including the one issued by the United Nations, will not be deported. An operation by the Mayanmar military has led to an exodus of Rohingyas from the Rakhine state in that country to India and Bangladesh. Many of them, who had fled to India after the earlier spate of violence, have settled in Jammu, Hyderabad, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi-NCR and Rajasthan.
Many American Christians today know the Vineyard Movement as an association of churches that, as stated in our core values, leans “…toward the lost, the poor, the outcast, and the outsider with the compassion of Jesus” ( Core Values & Beliefs, p. 14 ).
We do so in obedience to the command of Scripture as we engage both our empathy and our resources to ease the plight of the marginalized, the dehumanized, and those in need of refuge.
“He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and
loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing.”
Deuteronomy 10:18
For the Vineyard, the plight of the world's refugees is, and must be, a vital concern of our local church communities. We seek to live out, and live within, Jesus' teaching on the Kingdom of God. Many of our churches already work with refugees and know how difficult their backgrounds have been, how genuine their aspirations are today, and how positive their contributions continue to be to their respective communities.
In accord with the Scriptures, we as Christians believe the eternal Kingdom of God supersedes the framework of contemporary American politics, and at the same time compels us to be good citizens (Rom. 13:1-7) who pray for our leaders in government (1 Timothy 2:1-3).
For these reasons:
We can choose to act toward refugees with empathy and attentive compassion . We want to build bridges to those in need, and can choose bridge-building language in all our communications as believers in Christ, as Vineyard churches, as individuals on social media, and in any arena in which we are given a voice.
We can choose love over fear as we acknowledge that those who support the immigration ban reference a fear that Americans will not be safe. But we believe love is greater than fear. This enables us to love and serve those Jesus taught us to consider the “least of these.”
We can love all people, including our current President, as we serve those Jesus taught us to consider the “least of these.”
Cpt Patrick Archer – 06/05/2017 im not this isnt about hurting hades at all it's about getting rid of useless blues like drones and igc
Over the last few weeks Eve News 24 has been following and investigating the diplomatic tensions surrounding Triumvirate. <TRI> and it's allies. Rumors surfaced, through the leaks obtained by kugutsumen.org and, written about by Seraph IX Basarab, detailing embarrassing command chat logs within Triumvirate/Vanguard's directorship that seemed to indicate their (Tri's) desire to set their allies blue and potentially attack DRF/Gemico or FCON. This article was followed up by one of mine detailing some of the history, political layout, and specific situations that continued to destabilize the south and spark a war between allied alliances. I also covered the ejection of Manifesto. from Vanguard Coalition. Shortly after the article was published, streamer Manny Bothans hosted several major null-sec players on their show and the situation surrounding Triumvirate was one of the major topics discussed. The panel included UaXDeath (Exec of DRF/Gemico) and Tarkinius (Exec of FCON) and confirmed the bulk of the articles and reached a consensus that Triumvirate. was taking these actions to get ‘content', and a win, after their failed deployment north against Guardians of the Galaxy. While no one faulted them for looking for content the heavy handed treatment of not only allies but coalition members by Triumvirate./Vanguard High Command, repeated violation of Non-Invasion or Non-Aggression Pacts (NIP/NAP), as well as their (Tri's) desire to launch an attack against DRF or FCON led most to feel that they were burning bridges and breaking trusts that would likely impede future diplomatic negotiations from ever being reached with Triumvirate.
After our initial articles, Triumvirate. leaders denied any desire or plans to attack the Drone Region Federation/Gemico and that the logs had been faked. However, multiple parties involved and present in the channels have since verified the information. Furthermore, the direct messages between Cpt Patrick Archer and Marrowbone (see below) further confirm the discussion of these plans. The desire to, or even consideration, by Triumvirate. to even consider attacking DRF/Gemico is significant. Triumvirate. holds its current space through agreements with and at the invitation of DRF/Gemico.
Eve News 24 interviewed a former long time member of Vanguard Coalition Leadership and were provided with direct chats between Hell's Pirates Alliance leader Marrowbone and Cpt Patrick Archer (Vanguard Coalition XO/Acting Coalition Leader during Garst's absence). Now it should be noted that Marrowbone came to us after their alliance was ejected from Vanguard Coalition for ‘low participation'. We realize this could bias them as a source and maybe not present a full picture of both sides of the story. However, EN24 was provided with multiple verified logs and independent sources that have confirmed and validated Marrowbone's information.
Marrowbone said they planned to “stay quiet” until several incidents occurred. Triumvirate. Exec Garst Tyrell posted a secretly recorded conversation between them and Manifesto co-executor Piotr Engels to Reddit in a heavy handed attempt to control the narrative. I won't rehash that but if you want to read about it you can do it here. While Marrowbone holds no hard feelings towards Garst, they did feel the attempt to use the recording to falsely slant the narrative with Manifesto. and comments made by Triumvirate. leadership about HADES pushed Marrowbone to come forward and make sure that Hell's Pirates' side of the story was public, before similar methods were utilized by Triumvirate. leadership. They hold no hard feelings but, since their previous steadfast and deep support for Vanguard, they found their motives moving their alliance were doubted. They felt it was important to make sure accurate facts were public about what happened both with her, their alliance, and the breakdown of trust within Vanguard as a whole. Hell's Pirates had a long relationship with both as a ally of Triumvirate. and a founding member of the Vanguard Coalition. Much like the diplomatic drama surrounding Manifesto., FCON, and other allies, things seemed to ratchet up when Garst went AFK for real life reasons and left Cpt Patrick Archer in charge of both Triumvirate and the coalition. When they (Patrick) announced a deployment north to attack the Guardians of the Galaxy Coalition they only took Triumvirate and left the rest of the coalition. Marrowbone as a alliance exec and informal leader inside of Vanguard picked up the reigns and worked with the coalition and FCON to protect Triumvirate.'s sovereignty and keep the remaining coalition members active and defending their space. Multiple line members from all the involved credit Marrowbone with taking a bad situation and keeping the coalition together while Triumvirate was off in the north.
Due to Triumvirate.'s absence and lack of concern at what was happening ‘back home' Marrowbone had to create an infrastructure and communication system to coordinate between the remaining Vanguard members and other blues (FCON, TBC, ect). This became handy as Marrowbone also had to spend considerable time patching up diplomatic incidents caused by Patrick, their heavy handed approach, and violating multiple diplomatic agreements, with FCON and other allies. After Triumvirate.'s deployment failed and they returned home Cpt Patrick Archer recalled the entire coalition to a central location to “make ISK and ‘krab' to support an upcoming war'. They also called a coalition leadership meeting with the following:
That all alliances were to rat to support a ‘upcoming war' (No specifics were given on whom the war was with)
It was at this point, that command chats and private messages show that Triumvirate was eyeing a reset of the Drone Region Federation/Gemico allies in the north and considered them ‘Useless blues'.
Below is a series of DMs between Marrowbone and Patrick discussing the reset. We have not edited any of them except to add a few words in parenthesis for clarification:
Cpt Patrick Archer – 05/24/2017: hi, you here? there's been a massive push from basically every1 in TRI to remove droneland standings, announcing those 4 groups joining VG triggered it again I'm of the same opinion and I think we should move forward That will 75% sure mean lose our droneland holdings Thoughts? DON'T SHARE WITH FAFER until i talk to them ——————————————————————– Marrowbone – 06/05/2017 Look pat I have had your back since garst left because I promised I would and even when I don't agree with you and my own ppl are leaving I'm doing it anyway. So all I'm asking is what's the plan here we go fight of Gemico and drf at one Were good but not that good Marrowbone – 06/05/2017 You said we were resetting all of them Cpt Patrick Archer – 06/05/2017 yea i hate useless blues they give us nothing havent for months Marrowbone – 06/05/2017 Umm so if we lose er (Etherium Reach) How do we get supplies in except gwls (Great Wild Lands) Where we will die Cpt Patrick Archer – 06/05/2017 gw we've been using gw since forever we used to jump to poses and now astras Marrowbone – 06/05/2017 All I'm asking is for u to slow down and think abt this. Like why not take on one thing at a time Cpt Patrick Archer – 06/05/2017 we are thing one is reset drones Marrowbone – 06/05/2017 Ok so how do I get the money back and all our shit moved We aren't you pat We lived outta there for ages We don't have money or time to move fast Cpt Patrick Archer – 06/05/2017 i mean you can stall till july if you want but garst is gonna be of the same opinion Marrowbone – 06/05/2017 I know what they say I talk to them every night But I'm going to lose ppl over this It is going to knock Hades down alor Alot Cpt Patrick Archer – 06/05/2017 why do you keep saying that if it's compensated? Marrowbone – 06/05/2017 With bloody what We have to good sec systems U literally gave every one in vanguard better sov and moons then us And yeah you gave us some sov in er but most we took Like if its me u don't like fine ill walk away but don't punish hades Cpt Patrick Archer – 06/05/2017 im not this isnt about hurting hades at all it's about getting rid of useless blues like drones and igc
There appears to be two interesting things going on in this exchange. Cpt Patrick Archer is building a narrative that due to the four new members of Vanguard, that Triumvirate. members are demanding a reset of DRF due to lack of content and a glut of blues. On its surface, this would be a reasonable statement but, remember, that some of those new members were forced into Vanguard under threat of join us or be invaded. If your members are unhappy with having so many blues and a lack of content then why would you then create more blues by threat of violence? The second interesting thing is Triumvirate considers DRF/Gemico a ‘useless blue' and that ‘they give us nothing haven't for months'. I find this interesting, because it was the agreements with and efforts by DRF that allowed Triumvirate. to hold the space they have had. No matter how you read this, the obvious disdain for DRF/Gemico on the part of Triumvirate. is quite telling. Having the highest level of leadership refer to their long time allies as ‘useless' and ‘giving us nothing' speaks volumes. When Marrowbone attempts to slow down the conversation and advocate for a different course Patrick shows a singular focus on their goals. They state “All I'm asking is for u to slow down and think about this [resetting DRF]. Like why not take on one thing at a time?” The response from Patrick is straightforward, and can not be misinterpreted:
Cpt Patrick Archer – 06/05/2017 we are thing one is reset drones
At the end of the most recent broadcast of ‘Saturday Night Live Korea,' the whole cast came out on stage to apologize for the sexual harassment scandal that has been plaguing the show. Only Shin Dong Yup and Tak Jae Hoon spoke, but they all bowed deeply in apology.
Dong Yup said: I want to apologise to any one who we dissappointed or who we have troubled during the last week. Both our actions and our intentions were wrong. I want to point out that it was not the fault of one single person, it was the whole casts' fault.
Tak Jae Hoon also commented: There is no excuse for that (kind of) behaviour. I sincerely apologise to every one. I am sorry.
I don't believe there's any evidence that either Shin Dong Yup or Tak Jae Hoon had anything to do with this, but I assume they're apologizing because they're seen as the leaders of the cast.
Anyway, at least ‘SNL Korea' finally admitted that it wasn't just B1A4 that were victimized and that it wasn't just Lee Se Young who did it. Granted, they didn't have much choice but to cop to it since the police are actively investigating the show, but I guess it's something at least.
As I linked to in my last post, a Twitter user today leaked a number of screenshots from the forthcoming Final Cut Pro X and the as yet unannounced Motion 5. The photos have been removed from TwitPic and the Twitter account that shared them has now been taken offline. Luckily, blogs like Appleinsider and Macrumors Odds are these are legit. Apple previewed FCP X back in April, and the one screenshot that comes from it looks pretty inline with what they teased at NAB.
Apple promised to ship FCP X for $299 in the Mac App Store sometime in June. These screenshots are the first we are seeing of Motion 5. Let's poke around the images and see what we see.
FCP X Import
Let's start off with Final Cut Pro's video import settings panel. Here's a transcript of what it says in there:
Organizing * Copy files to Final Cut Events folder * Import folders as Keyword Collections * Transcoding * Create optimized media * Create proxy media * Video * Analyze for stabilization and rolling shutter * Analyze for balance color * Find people * Consolidate find people results * Create Smart Collections after analysis * Audio * Analyze and fix audio problems * Separate mono and group stereo audio * Remove silent channels
### Organizing and Transcoding ###
If these really are all of the settings editors are allotted for importing tapeless format, there are going to be a lot of confused customers. My main confusion is under the “Transcoding” menu. We've grown so accustomed to the growing number of ProRes formats, are we now to understand that we are given merely two options, “optimized” or “proxy” media?
Moreover, what is a transcode anyway? The first check box implies that FCP X will simply move your tapeless media into the “Final Cut Events folder”. What's most interesting, for better or worse, is that that is even an option at all. Will this folder operate somewhat like the iTunes Music folder, where it keeps media consolidated if you like it to? Or will you be allowed to roll your own file system structuring. Since FCP X is supposed to leverage every processor in your machine to allow you to cut raw media, what are This transcodes for? How come you can have both “options” and “proxy” media. I'm not too worried about these options being set out the way they are, but I can say, if this is real, they raise a lot of questions about what an FCP X workflow actually looks like.
Video
Most of the video settings we see here are exactly what was teased at NAB, and they are a very good sign. All of the seemingly superfluous, automated doodads (which may actually turn out to be lifesavers) that Apple is pushing hard can be turned off. Many editors, after the original demo, were worried that FCP X was going to start automating the entire cutting process, coloring video you'd rather leave raw or getting rid of rolling shutter even if you want to keep it. This screengrab implies that those processes won't happen on ingest. Instead, FCP X has the ability to “analyze” the media so that you can flip a switch later to implement any quick changes.
Analyzing your footage for rolling shutter, making it easier to correct later, can be a great feature, but it can also be a huge strain on your processor. Though Apple says it will happen in the background, it's likely that many of these processes will slow down your cutting while the media is ingesting. So it's a very good thing you can turn off color and “people” analysis; especially “people” analysis. I turned on face detection for four years worth of photos when I first got Aperture 3. Not only did it take the better part of a day to complete the process, but it ground Aperture to a halt while it chewed through the photos. Thank goodness this is optional.
Audio
I'm actually most excited about the check boxes listed here. The only one that is scary is “Analyze and fix audio problems”. That's like saying to the computer to “make me dinner”; even if it pops out something edible, it probably won't be what you wanted. This kind of vague automation will prove itself either useful or useless over time. Perhaps there's another dialog in which we can pick what fixes we would like to apply.
Still, that “Separate mono and group stereo” looks pretty great. I wish there were a way to automate this into tape-based workflows. I've seen a lot of mistakes made because people just don't know how the tracks were recorded. Let the computer sort that out. And that “Remove silent channels”? Bye bye 16 extra channels of DVCProHD.
Motion
I realize I've already been long-winded about a single supposed Final Cut Pro screenshot. The good news is I have way fewer opinions about a new rev of Motion. Let's start with the best one:
Project Browser
Here are the options users are presented when creating new Motion projects:
Motion Project * Final Cut Effect * Final Cut Generator * Final Cut Transition * Final Cut Title
Now this could get fun. It's starting to look like there is some deep integration between Final Cut Pro and Motion. Anything effect generated in Final Cut can now be created by you and your team. The sky could be the limit, but it's unclear how this would work exactly. For example, a “Final Cut Effect” would presumably be a color or stylized type of overlay for video clips. Do you have to create these for a single frame size and frame rate? Will HD effects work on SD footage and vice versa? The same goes for transitions.
If this screenshot and its implications turn out to be true, then perhaps Motion really has swallowed up Color. A Final Cut Effect could potentially act as a sort of color grade or LUT that could be dropped on whole scenes. Or it could be something we haven't even thought of. Speaking of Color.
Where's Color?
This image is also supposedly from the new Motion. This would seem to be pretty good proof that Color is now a feature within Motion 5. While there is certainly need for a complex Waveform monitor in a motion graphics application, this looks fairly complex, as does the waveform of whatever image was loaded into the app when this was taken. Even if this waveform monitor is only in Motion, it would seem to make the functionality of the two apps redundant. Why not split them? Better, why not put Color right into Final Cut?
I love Color in its current form. not only is it incredibly powerful, but it also promotes discipline among cutters. I know it's not the best argument for it, but by keeping Color and Soundtrack Pro as separate apps, cutters have been forced to follow a traditional editorial model and actually lock picture for good. Non-destructive editing systems have made tweaking so easy that an edit could never end. Technically, you could always send a project to Color, so some work, then bring it back, cut some more, then send it back out, but it was a pain in the ass. It would have been the same pain in the ass to go to a supervised color correct in telecine more than once. So we had to learn discipline.
If Color has now been integrated into another app, that will make it even more efficient and allow for quicker turnarounds. Maybe it's just me who will be tempted to tweak color, then tweak the edit, then tweak the color again… In fact, that doesn't sound too bad. I hope we get to see the real thing soon so I can stop with this wild speculation.
President Donald Trump, asked this morning why they think the press is not reporting on terror attacks – a stunning claim they made yesterday in a speech to military personnel – told a pool reporter, “I don't have to think, I have to know.”
“Because I am reported on, possibly more than anybody in the world,” they said. “I happen to know how dishonest the media is. I happen to know stories about me that should be good — or bad, you know I don't mind a bad story if it's true. But I don't like stories…that should be a positive story when they make them totally negative. I understand the total dishonesty of the media. Better than anybody. I let people know it.”
“The media is a very, very dishonest arm, and we'll see what happens. Not everybody, I have to say that,” they added “But there is tremendous dishonesty, pure outright dishonesty, from the media. Let's go into the Oval Office,” they said, indicating they were done explaining how they know the media is not reporting on terror attacks.
The exchange happened as Trump met in the White House with sheriffs from counties around the country, to defend their controversial travel ban. “ISIS said we are going to infiltrate the United States and other countries, through migration. And then we're not allowed to be tough on the people coming in? Explain that one.”
“Some thing are law, and I'm all in favor of that. And then, some things are common sense,” Trump said. “This is common sense,” they said of their travel ban affecting travel from seven countries. Federal judges are set to rule on whether the hold on the ban stays in place.

Oliver Percovich Unites Afghani Kids Through Non-profit Skateistan
Typically, males and females are strictly segregated from mixing together in Afghani culture. But thanks to Australian Oliver Percovich, Kabul children from all backgrounds are creating a common bond—on wheels.
In Kabul, 10-year-old girls like Fazila Shrindul are taught to wear headscarves at all times, and are not permitted to play with, or even speak to, males who are not in their immediate family. Typically, males and females are strictly segregated from mixing together in Afghani culture. But thanks to Australian Oliver Percovich, Kabul children from all backgrounds are creating a common bond—on wheels.
Since 2007, Percovich has been leading a nonprofit club known as “Skateistan” at an old dried-out fountain in downtown Kabul. There, Percovich teaches curious kids how to skateboard, giving boys and girls, street beggars and middle-class children alike, the opportunity to socialize and learn from one another in a fun and wholesome environment. Many of the street kids have grown accomplished enough at skateboarding that they are now paid to instruct other children, and can make several dollars a day doing something they enjoy.
About 90 children currently participate in the skate program, but Percovich hopes to soon more than triple the organization's size: they have received enough donations from private individuals and government bodies that they are now building a $1 million indoor skate park, which will also host educational classes for the children there.
“The boards are just our carrots,” Percovich told the Los Angeles Times. “They're a way to connect with kids and build trust.”
Skateistan gives Percovich the opportunity to befriend the children and encourage them to pursue education. The group skating programs also help the children to learn that they may not be as different from others as they might have thought, and gives them the chance to nurture understanding among their own social groups.
“We're just here to plant seeds—and then it's up to the youth here to grow up and make changes in their own communities their own way,” said Percovich.

MIDDLEBURG HEIGHTS, Ohio -- On the day it was reported that the late Junior Seau suffered from CTE, a brain disease, resulting from constant brain trauma, former Browns QB Bernie Kosar held a news conference to talk of their experiences post career due to multiple concussions.
Kosar, who led the Browns to three straight AFC title game appearances in the late 1980s, said that they have been dealing with ringing, buzzing in their head, and insomnia over the years. These are many of the symptoms that Seau suffered from during and after their career, which culminated with them taking their own life.
Kosar spoke of situations in games when they had smelling salts on their person. A quick whiff would get their head straight, but not before they would call a play for a straight hand off to Kevin Mack to give them time to recover.
*Read other stories trending on FOX8.com
Browns fans have heard Kosar's speech in recent years and questioned whether they have been drinking or using a controlled substance. Kosar said that is a direct result of the head trauma they suffered in their career.
Kosar said they dealt with symptoms for 10 to 12 years with no relief, but in the last month they have been treated by Dr. Rick Sponaugle of Palm Harbor, Florida. Kosar expressed some relief that the treatments are having a positive effect.
"I really feel blessed to be restored in terms of the brain and the trauma that was there. I almost feel like it's gone, to the point where I almost feel 20 years younger," they said.
The news conference was called in order to explain their predicament and to alert other former players of the help they received from Dr. Sponaugle. Kosar claimed they are not part of the thousands of lawsuits brought against the league by former players who suffered head trauma.
FANWOOD -- A 26-year-old Plainfield woman was electrocuted after downed wires fell on their car and they attempted to exit the vehicle, police confirmed.
Fanwood Police Chief Richard Trigo said the wires fell on the car, a white sedan, causing sparks, around 4:30 p.m. on the 100 block of Midway Avenue.
The woman then attempted to exit the car from the passenger side when they were electrocuted by the live current, Trigo said. They were pronounced dead at the scene.
Patrol officers arriving on the scene saw sparks coming from the car, Trigo said.
Bob Pacio, who lives across the street, said they came outside after hearing a loud pop.
"Then I saw flames shooting out from the car," Pacio said. "Police were here but couldn't get in because the wires were live."
What to do if live wires hit your car
Pacio said they saw the car's passenger side door open, but didn't see anything else at first and said they thought the woman was still in the car.
Police have not released the woman's identity as their next of kin have not yet been notified.
The tragedy in Fanwood occurred as a line of strong thunderstorms swept across New Jersey, packing wind gusts as high as 68 miles per hour, toppling trees and knocking out power to more than 22,000 homes and businesses.
Among the places that lost power was the Bridgewater Commons mall, a shopper reported.
The 68 mph wind gust was reported at Linden Airport, the National Weather Service said. Among the other strong gusts across the state were 65 mph at Newark Liberty International Airport, 53 mph in Fortescue in Cumberland County, 53 mph in Newport in Cumberland, 49 mph in Atlantic City, 47 mph in Howell in Monmouth County and 47 mph in Blackwood in Camden County.
For the second time in five days, a barn was badly damaged by strong winds in Warren County during the thunderstorms. Last Thursday, a low-level tornado caused widespread damage on a farm in White Township.

Modern Paleo Principles
By Diana Hsieh
A "paleo" approach to health uses the evolutionary history of Homo sapiens, plus the best of modern science, as a broad framework for guiding daily choices about diet, fitness, medicine, and supplementation. The core of paleo is the diet: it eschews grains, sugars, and modern vegetable oils in favor of high-quality meat, fish, eggs, and vegetables. The principles below offer further details.
Importantly, the paleo approach is an ever-evolving framework of principles for living well, not dogma written in stone by any supposed authority. Experts and laypersons in the paleo community differ in some of their recommendations, as well as in their personal choices. Such debate is healthy, particularly while our knowledge of the principles of robust health remains in its infancy. Moreover, individuals differ in their tolerances and preferences. Each individual must experiment to discover what works best for him.
The following recommendations represent my own grasp of the best practices of the paleo approach to nutrition, fitness, and supplementation. However, I am a layperson: I'm a philosopher, not a scientist. These principles represent my own personal opinions. They should not substitute for your own research, thinking, and experience -- or for the advice of your doctor.

China's fighter aircraft development efforts appeared to take another leap forward after local media reported that Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC) had successfully tested its J-31 stealth fighter prototype this week. Following the test flight of a Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC) J-20 prototype less than two years ago, the test of the J-31 suggests China could eventually become only the second country behind the U.S. to develop two stealth fighter programs – an important development with serious potential implications for the tactical aircraft export market and well as the U.S. military.
Video and photos posted online Thursday show the J-31 prototype conducting an initial high speed taxi run and 10-minute flight test accompanied by a pair of SAC J-11BS fighters. The J-31's maiden flight represents the second “unveiling” of a significant new fighter aircraft by SAC in less than a year, the other being the J-16, a two seat multi-role variant of the J-11B, similar to the US F-15E and the Russian Su-30MKK.
China's defense industry can now sustain multiple overlapping advanced programs. SAC alone is currently working on four major fighter aircraft – the J-31 and the J-16 as well as the J-16's single seat parent the J-11B and the carrier-based J-15, also based on the J-11B.
Like most modern fighter aircraft, the J-31 will likely be a multi-role combat aircraft capable of employing modern precision munitions in both air-to-air and air-to-surface roles. Despite apparent rapid advancement, however, it will take time for the fighter to reach full operational status. As Xu Guangyu of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association explains, “there is still a huge gap between China and the US' fighter jet technologies because we are still testing both the J-20 and the J-31. It might take another couple of years before we can put them on the production line.”
Mr. Xu's observation raises an interesting question because it is not yet clear if the J-20 and J-31 are intended to complement each other or be competitors. Some Chinese analysts like former Aviation World deputy editor Bai Wei share the view of Western counterparts that they may be complementary as part of a “high-low” mix, with the larger J-20 akin to the F-22 and the smaller J-31 akin to the U.S. F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.
One factor that suggests the J-20 and J-31 could complement one another is that the J-31 could be modified for use on aircraft carriers in a way the larger J-20 is unlikely to be. Sr. Capt. Li Jie of the PLA Navy (PLAN)'s strategic think tank has been quoted in Western media as stating the J-31 prototype “might become a carrier-based fighter jet” because it is smaller and slimmer than the J-20.
Regional Impacts
The prospect of the J-20 and J-31 becoming China's mainstay tactical strike fighters during the next decade stands to influence regional defense planning and tactical aircraft export markets. Unveiling the J-31 affirms that, save for jet engines, China's aerospace sector is now in many ways nearly as advanced as Russia's and suggests that Russian manufacturers will soon be unable to compete with China's own fighter manufacturers. Beijing is already the world's sixth-largest arms exporter, and Chinese aircraft export growth would come largely at Moscow's expense.
This means Russia will need to shift its weapons exports from China to Chinese neighbors such as Vietnam and India. However, given the defense spending cutbacks in the U.S. and Western Europe, Russian firms will have to compete with the likes of Boeing, Lockheed Martin and BAE in a way they never had to when China (which Western defense firms are largely prohibited from selling to by an embargo) was essentially a captive market for Russian weapons exporters. Chinese e increasingly Therefore, the parallel development of the J-20 and J-31 will provide further impetus for China's aviation industry to master mass-production of modern high-performance jet engines -- its last major obstacle to being able to export tactical aircraft.
The J-31 also stands to meaningfully impact decisions on U.S. defense spending, especially if it ends up being produced in conjunction with the J-20 and they end up being complementary to one another. If the J-31 and J-20 both end up in mass production, China could ultimately achieve parity or perhaps even numerical superiority in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of late-generation fighters deployed. There is a rising probability that China's rapid advancement in indigenous tactical aircraft design will spark a renewed debate in the U.S. over restarting production of the highly advanced but also highly expensive F-22 Raptor.
Bottom Line: China's Military Aerospace Industry Nearing Critical Mass
It is extremely significant that China may soon join the U.S. as the only other nation to develop two “low-observable” aircraft simultaneously. China's defense aerospace sector overall may be moving toward an architectural model in which several distinct poles of expertise develop in Shenyang, Xi'an, and Chengdu and then compete with each other on key big ticket projects. Multiple aviation industry bases with significant development and production capacity, including SAC, allow for domestic competition for key aircraft programs. This can minimize the chances of single-point failures jeopardizing development targets, increase efficiency, and maximize the chances of useful breakthroughs.
It is thus not too early to consider the possibility that China's aviation industry, despite enduring limitations, may already enjoy some key advantages over Western counterparts. As a latecomer, China can draw on knowledge gleaned from industrial espionage, reverse engineering, and study of foreign systems, standards, and specifications, allowing it to save costs by leapfrogging rather than developing every component itself. Meanwhile, it may benefit from lack of legal obstacles to subsidization and technical diffusion through civil-military integration—a lack that Western contractors arguably benefitted from during their Cold War heyday before stricter regulations emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. China's military aerospace industry is rapidly approaching critical mass. Continuing to add investment to this growing foundation will allow China's aviation industry to fully harness the flashes of technical prowess shown when new aircraft like the J-31 take flight.

Michell McClenaghan is currently with Mumbai Indians in IPL © BCCI
Middlesex have signed New Zealand's left arm paceman Mitchell McClenaghan, as an overseas replacement for Kyle Abbott in this season's NatWest T20 Blast campaign after Abbott's spell with the club expires at the end of June.
McClenaghan is currently playing for the Mumbai Indians at the Indian Premier League, where they are among the leading wicket takers in the competition, with 14 at an average of 22.50.
They will be in contention to make their NatWest T20 Blast debut for Middlesex against the Sussex Sharks at Lord's on July 2 and will be available for the final six group matches of Middlesex's NatWest T20 Blast campaign.
McClenaghan did not have an impressive stint at Lancashire in T20, but their stock has risen on the back of some skilful, wholehearted displays with Mumbai Indians and their figures have given Middlesex additional confidence that they can answer their needs.
Middlesex's managing director of cricket, Angus Fraser, commented: "Replacing one high quality overseas fast bowler with another was not easy but we have managed to do this with the signing of McClenaghan.
"Mitchell's style, left arm fast, gives them a point of difference and their skill has allowed them to take wickets wherever they have played. We look forward to welcoming them to Lord's at the start of July, for what we hope will be six important and exciting games."

Inspired by Ben's awesome video on LED lights on their house, I decided to something similar. My approach is more off the shelf than theirs and I give up the ability to individually address each LED but in my implementation, that was ok since I just wanted to accent the house ridge lines.
Parts list for this weekend project are as follows:
1 x LED RGB Wifi Controller
1 x LED Light Strip Kit
1 x Power Supply
1 x Outdoor Housing
2 x Aluminum LED Diffuser housing
3 x Hue colored lights.
3 x E27 to E12 socket adapter
Setting up these lights from a Home Assistant perspective is SUPER easy. The RGB Controller linked above is supported OUT OF THE BOX by Home Assistant using the Flux_LED component.
They use standard IP so if your WIFI coverage reaches outdoor places, controlling these LED strips is pretty easy. I have the good fortune of having AC outlets in my eaves so this, plus the WIFI, made the installation super easy. The only real challenge I had was making sure the controller was sort of waterproof. Under the eaves gave it pretty good coverage already so adding them into a standard AC box was the perfect solution to protect them from the elements.
A little double-sided tape to keep the controller in place was all I needed. From there, one opening was used for the Power and the other for the LED strips themselves.
The diffusers were a luxury item. Since the LED strips themselves are waterproof already, the diffusers weren't needed for protection but they really change the way the light is bounced off the house. Since the LEDs are made up of RGB lights, using a diffuser gives it a much softer light on the house. You can see the difference pretty dramatically when making the lights white or yellow. I feel like the diffusers also made it MUCH easier to attach to the house. They are rigid and much easier to nail into house. For my install, I used the wood edging under the eaves to point the LEDs AT the house so you would see the soft reflective light from the street. I think the effect came out great personally.
In addition to LED lights, I also added in 3 HUE lights to my outdoor sconces. The scones were set up with 3 candelabra type lights so I need to purchase adapters to put the standard Hue E27 lights in there. Since I was replacing 3 higher wattage bulbs with the single lower wattage bulb (per sconce), I felt good about this swap. They have been working this way for about a year without issue.
The final set up allows me to pretty easily change the look of the house using just 7 addressable light elements (4 HUE bulbs – 1 foyer, 3 Sconces & 3 LED strips).
I have written a pretty easy YAML script to change the colors of the house for all of the major holidays and a few of the lesser known ones. All of this happens automatically based on the script so you can add in your own favorites.
The script Monthly Colors changes the smart home's look depending on the day. Holiday colors or a standard Gold/Yellow for all of the other days.
Since these are all addressable, we also have some automations that for instance, turn ALL the lights to a bright white when certain events happen. Examples include movement in front of the house at night or any of the garage doors opening. For movement, I am currently using my SkyBell HD to detect the movement and for Garage door detection, we have Garadget.
I feel like this easy weekend project gave the house a pretty cool look and lots of flexibility to change it when we want to. Adding in some smarts (Sunset/Sunrise detection) and replacing out all those hungry incandescent lights also had a pretty good side effect on my electric bill.
Be sure to check out the rest of my #IOT posts by clicking the hashtag link.
If you end up doing this project, be sure to post some picture in the comments below. I would love to see them!
** Update ** I put out a new video on how I am using these lights for the Holidays. Check it out here : vCloudInfo – YouTube
Happy Automating!

Meanwhile, the Twin Peaks discussion continues…
The strategist Karl Rove and their allies last week announced the formation of Conservative Victory Project, a new “super PAC” designed to lend support to what they see as more electable candidates in Republican Senate primaries.
The effort makes plenty of sense on the surface. Republican primary voters nominated a series of inexperienced and extremely conservative candidates in Senate races in 2010 and 2012, often with the support of the Tea Party and other insurgent groups. It can be argued that they lost as many as a half-dozen Senate races as a result, including the contests in Delaware and Nevada in 2010 and in Missouri and Indiana last year.
But conservative groups and activists have reacted very harshly to the announcement, while some conservative candidates who are potential targets of the group, like Representative Steve King of Iowa, have already sought to raise money off the backlash to it.
An analysis of Republican Senate primaries in 2010 and 2012 suggests that money is usually the least pressing problem for the incumbents and other establishment-backed candidates whom Mr. Rove's group might be inclined to support. Instead, some insurgent candidates won their races despite having been at more than a 10-to-1 fund-raising disadvantage heading into the primary.
The table below reflects 23 Senate races between 2010 and 2012 in which an establishment-backed candidate squared off against an insurgent candidate in a Republican Senate primary. There are some judgment calls required in selecting the races, particularly because the Tea Party consists of no one single group but instead an informal network of organizations that tend to back highly conservative candidates. In other cases, some candidates, like former Representative Pat Toomey in the Pennsylvania Senate primary in 2010, tended to be supported by both Tea Party and establishment groups; these instances are excluded. The list includes a number of relatively obscure candidates. I do require, however, that the candidates listed were viable enough to have filed at least one fund-raising report with the Federal Election Commission.
Photo
These issues aside, the overall message from the data should be reasonably clear. The establishment candidates substantially outraised the insurgents, by an average of $4.3 million to $1.2 million based on the last Federal Election Commission reports that the candidates filed in advance of the primary. (The difference in median fund-raising totals, which reduces the influence of outliers, is just as substantial: about $3 million for the establishment candidates versus about $400,000 for the insurgents.)
And yet, the insurgent candidates won 11 of 23 races, or nearly half the contests. Joe Miller of Alaska did so in 2010 despite being at nearly a 20-to-1 fund-raising disadvantage against the incumbent Lisa Murkowski. Christine O'Donnell of Delaware defeated Representative Mike Castle that year despite having raised about $260,000 to Mr. Castle's $3.2 million.
Does that mean there is literally no benefit to having more money in a Republican primary? Not exactly; as the chart below suggests, there is a modest but positive correlation between the share of the funds that went to the establishment candidate and that candidate's margin of victory or defeat.
Photo
However, the relationship is much weaker than it is in general elections for the Senate, when fund-raising totals have about twice as much power to predict the margin between the Democratic and Republican candidates. (The chart below reflects all Senate general elections between 1990 and 2010 in which both the Democratic and Republican candidate were viable enough to have filed at least one F.E.C. report.)
Photo
Moreover, it is not clear that the correlation implies a strong causal link. Better fund-raising totals can serve as evidence that a campaign is well-organized, or has more grass roots support, which are indicators of candidate strength regardless of how the candidate actually deploys their financial resources. But if a superPAC spends a large sum in support of a candidate — or a candidate makes a large contribution to their own campaign — that money may not go far if the candidate is otherwise having a difficult time persuading voters of their merits. (Largely self-funded candidates, such as Linda McMahon of Connecticut and Carly Fiorina of California, have poor track records in recent years despite having gargantuan budgets.)
This may hold especially true in Senate primaries because they usually feature very light turnouts. (Ms. O'Donnell's win over Mr. Castle in 2010, for example, came with a turnout of only about 58,000 voters in Delaware, representing about 30 percent of Delaware's population of registered Republicans and less than 10 percent of Delaware registered voters of all parties.) The voters who do turn out in Republican Senate primaries are likely to be highly informed consumers of conservative-friendly news media outlets such as talk radio, prime-time shows on Fox News and conservative magazines and blogs. They may also weigh the endorsements of prominent conservative politicians and organizations. An insurgent candidate who is presented in a favorable light in these outlets may have plenty of ability to reach their target voters, even if they are spending little or nothing on paid advertisements and outreach efforts.
Mr. Rove's efforts could backfire, therefore, if they result in the insurgent candidate receiving more sympathetic treatment through these channels; the amount of so-called “earned media” that the insurgent receives could outweigh the extra advertisements that the establishment candidate is able to afford.
A related problem is that the insurgent candidates could seek to raise money directly in response to moves by Conservative Victory Project, as Mr. King of Iowa is attempting to do. This could be the case especially when insurgent candidates were otherwise having trouble raising funds.
My analysis of fund-raising data, in this context and others, has found that it is generally the proportion or ratio of funds raised by each candidate that has the most power to predict races, rather than the absolute amounts. This is a consequence of the diminishing returns of campaign spending: the first $100,000 of spending goes a lot further in establishing a candidate's viability than the marginal $100,000 after they have already spent $5 million.
Suppose, for example, that the establishment candidate has raised $3 million and the insurgent candidate $500,000, a six-to-one advantage for the establishment candidate. Mr. Rove's group intervenes and contributes $1 million to the establishment candidate, bringing them to $4 million total. In response, the insurgent candidate raises $500,000 through grass roots groups, bringing them to $1 million total. Despite the absolute difference between the candidates' fund-raising totals having increased, the ratio has declined to a four-to-one advantage for the establishment candidate from six-to-one previously, arguably leaving the insurgent candidate in better shape than before the fund-raising salvos.
The intuition is simply that it may be dangerous to raise the profile of an insurgent candidate for whom a little extra money and exposure could go a long way.
Where might Mr. Rove's efforts be more likely to achieve their desired goals? One case would be in multiple-candidate primaries where there are two or more establishment-backed candidates running against one insurgent. This eventuality has come up quite frequently in recent years, such as in the Nevada primary in 2010 and the Missouri primary last year, when the insurgent candidate was able to win with 40 percent or less of the vote. By directing money to one of the establishment candidates at the expense of the other, Mr. Rove's group could force the insurgent candidate to win an actual or near-majority of vote rather than a mere plurality.
The money raised by Mr. Rove's group might also be more likely to help candidates if it is directed toward functions other than advertising which have a lower public profile, although coordination rules related to super PACs can limit such efforts.
But the money may be less likely to help if Mr. Rove's group hopes to save struggling candidates through a barrage of advertisements late in the race. Republican voters have already been rejecting these candidates despite their overwhelming advantage in paid media placements, and often because they are viewed as too much a part of the Washington establishment. It will take more than a new super PAC for Mr. Rove to earn back their trust.
An earlier version of this post referred imprecisely to the support a candidate receives from a PAC. While the political action committees can raise and spend money on behalf of a candidate, the candidate does not add the money directly to their or their campaign coffers.
Savage Steve Holland wrote and directed Better Off Dead, in addition to being an incredibly nice guy. I recently had the chance to hang out with both Savage and Dan Schneider (who played Ricky), to discuss the movie in depth.
The following is Part One of our talk which includes, among many interesting topics, Savage's very candid and detailed explanation of just how much John Cusack hates the movie.
Exactly how well or not well did the movie do?
Savage Steve: I think it did fine because it was only 3.5 million dollars to produce and it made 10 million, but everybody was still super-disappointed.
Did you feel vindicated when it became so popular later on?
SS: Somewhat. First of all, I didn't know the business or anything. Really, I was always just making little short movies. So this was like my big opportunity, but I didn't even think of it like that. To me it was just another step, and it was the funnest thing I could have ever done, making the movie, and meeting Dan, and all the people were all so amazing in it.
And every day we were going, "This is hilarious. Am I wrong?" And it was like, every day anything we shot was really funny. So at my first test screening... I'll never forget it, the movie was like five or seven minutes longer, and the audience reaction was pretty good, but it wasn't that good.
And I remember one guy walking out, and for some reason they knew me, and they go, "Hey, better luck next time."
And I'm like, "Oh shit, I'm doomed." It really hurt.
Do you know where they are today?
SS: He's probably running Paramount with my luck.
I was just hoping they were homeless.
SS: No, because mean people always get the good jobs.
But we cut out about five really over the top, stupid jokes that were in there that you would never miss. I loved them, but they were really stupid. And at the next screening it was like 99% of everybody thought it was great.
I got a call from Michael Ovitz who was my big agent at the time. And they said they had the best screening Warner�s ever had. Like the best audience reaction, with people cheering and going crazy. And they said they witnessed it, and this movie was going to be a giant movie.
I thought it was going to make a hundred million dollars. I think that the fact that it has become so popular in It's afterlife is an indication of that. It�s just how the stars align. We just assumed because it was so funny, it would just kick ass.
Dan Schneider: If the movie had come out four months earlier, or four months later, been marketed a little bit differently, I think it could have made all the money in the world.
SS: You just never know.
When did you write it?
SS: Really right after college.
DS: Did you write it as a lark? Or did you think, "I�m going to go right out and sell this?"
SS: You know what? Honest to God, it was just a movie I really wanted to make. I had always made short movies, and I started with an 8 minute movie which got me into film festivals, and kinda got me noticed around here. And then based on that I did a longer one which was 22 minutes. And I said �Shoot, I should just write the whole story.� But Better Off Dead is a true story, pretty much. It�s an exaggerated true story.
So there was a girl you were that broken-hearted over?
SS: Oh yeah.
Have you ever spoken to them again? Do they know the movie is about her?
SS: That�s a great question. It�s really weird but they really broke my heart, and even through college I was still bummed out about it, but life went on. Then I made this funny movie. And like 6 years later, I got a call, I don�t know how they got my number, and they said, �I�ve been in therapy because I saw your movie and I had no idea."
I mean, they knew they hurt my feelings, but they were like, �I just feel horrible that I put you through all that.� And they sent me cookies and stuff.
And I was like, �Hey, I just bought a house. I wouldn�t worry about it. And you know when you�re a director you meet girls.�
Did they leave you for the dude on the ski team?!
SS: Oh, yes. Totally!
DS: I didn�t know it was that autobiographical. You didn�t really think about killing yourself, did you?!
SS: I did! I totally went through a suicidal stage. But this is where my suicidal stage went. This is the truth about as far as I got. I got an extension cord�
DS: It�s already funny.
SS: It gets worse. Because that part when Lane does this in the garage is true. I went into the garage, and I put an extension cord on a pipe, and I�m on a garbage can, and I�m thinking �Should I do this? Maybe this isn�t a good idea.� Anyway, it was a plastic garbage can, and my weight just like crashed through it, and I fell, and the pipe broke!
And it starts pouring water everywhere. And I�m basically in a garbage can, drowning. And my mom comes and, and my mom starts yelling at me for breaking a pipe, which is what any mom would do.
So I started writing down stupid ways to kill yourself that would fail after that, and I put them in sort of diary. And that diary kind of became Better Off Dead. And you know, all the bad stuff that happened to me in high school.
I just had this book of stupid stuff. And my paper boy, honest to God, Johnny Gasperini would come up to the house�I was a latch key kid, my mom wouldn�t come home until six, and this kid would come up to me and would say �Give me my two dollars.� And I�d say, �Hey, I�m just a kid in school! I don�t have two dollars. My mom will be home soon!�
And they would sit across the street waiting. And then he�d come back in ten minutes and say �You got my two dollars?� You�d think he�d wait for my mom�s car to pull up, at least, so I wrote that down.
How come there was no commentary track on the Better Off Dead DVD?
SS: I know. It�s because this movie is a bastard step-child. No one ever believes in it, cares about it. No one ever calls me about anything. The only time I hear nice things are when people like you tell me how much you liked it.
DS: You really didn�t have a thing to do with the DVD?
SS: Not a thing. Really. They didn�t even tell me it was coming out.
DS: That�s terrible. With the exception of Cusack, everyone would have gotten together to do commentary on it.
SS: Well, this movie has just never had respect, and it�s sad. But it�s so goddamn funny. I�m not just saying this because I made it. Sometimes I still look at it and I go, �This is still one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.� But again, it�s not because of me. And I have to say, first of all, Cusack being in it was amazing. They hated it. We�ll get to that. But Danny Schneider. I mean, things I never imagined. I never even pictured Danny Schneider as Ricky Smith.
DS: You know who almost got the part? Do you remember?
SS: Who? Oh, you�re going to say Clint Howard.
DS: Is that not true?
SS: It is true, but it�s not true in one way. In one way, the casting lady really wanted him, and they are Ron Howard�s brother, so there is that kind of thing. But that was just kinda old, and it wasn�t too funny.
DS: Oh, you didn�t want him?
SS: No. And I don�t mean that in a mean way! I�ll tell you what, if you hadn�t walked in the door, probably it would have been Clint Howard. And that�s with all due respect to him. They were the second funniest guy. But other people we saw, just wouldn�t have made it.
So, let's talk about Cusack hating the movie.
SS: Yeah. That was tragic. That was really sad.
I had met John when they were 17. We went to Yamashura and had drinks, which was totally illegal, and they were just the coolest guy. They were just so much fun and so funny and I was like, �You are my Lane.�
DS: But when it was all done and they were watching the final edit, they told you �I hate this?�
SS: No. It was worse than that. They actually came to a lot of the editing. We were really good friends. We had a lot of fun.
Then they went off to do some other movie, and when they came back they agreed to do One Crazy Summer. Which I had written a rough draft of, and they didn�t think it was that funny. And I just said, "I�m just gonna let you guys do your thing, and make it funnier when we get there." And I guess they paid them a lot of money.
SS: So this is short of a shocker. but we all got up to Cape Cod, and the night before we started shooting One Crazy Summer, we screened Better Off Dead for everyone that was up there because it was mostly the same crew, and a lot of the same cast.
We didn�t get Danny for some reason, I think I was mad at them or something- no I�m just kidding.
DS: Maybe you were mad at me, but I don�t know why.
SS: I�ve never been mad at you, that�s insane!
DS: Then why wasn�t I in One Crazy Summer?
SS: That�s a good question. I probably had something for you, but it got cut out. That was like a 150 page script, and it just got trimmed way down. Everything went crazy at that point. It wasn�t the �joy� that Better Off Dead was.
So we�re all watching the Better Off Dead screening that night, and John walked out of the movie. About 20 minutes into it, they walked out, and they never came back.
The next morning, they basically walked up to me and was like, �You know, you tricked me. Better Off Dead was the worst thing I have ever seen. I will never trust you as a director ever again, so don�t speak to me.�
DS: Are you kidding?!
SS: No, it was that bad. They were just really upset. And I said, �What happened?! What�s wrong?!� And they just said that I sucked, and it was the worst thing they had ever seen, and that I had used him, and made a fool out of him, and all this other stuff.
And I was just stunned, because it was as funny as shit. And they were great in it. And they were helping me edit it throughout the summer.
How did that affect you?
SS: It made me not care about movies anymore. And I didn�t even want to do One Crazy Summer at that point. I was just gone. It was sort of like the break-up that I made Better Off Dead about. It was so out of left field, that it just floored me.
And I told John, look, �I have this scene, you�re in it. Do what you want to do. But this is what it says and you can do whatever you want.� And then some reviews started coming out about Better Off Dead while we were still shooting One Crazy Summer. And people were writing giant stories about what a great, funny movie it was. It previewed in Rhode Island, and someone writes a 3 page newspaper story about how funny it was, and one of the grips tacked it on John�s door. So they started to lighten up. And Bob Goldthwait is really funny, and they brought a lot of levity to all of it, too. And started to tease John for being so cranky. But, you know, John doesn�t want to be �foolish� I guess? He�s more serious than we think, I guess.
Do you watch their movies?
SS: I think John is awesome. I love their movies. I think they are probably one of the best actors I have ever seen. And I�m grateful to him.
DS: I don't understand why they had such a negative reaction to it. I supposed that after they made it, they must have just decided it wasn't the type of movie they wanted to be making. But it�s weird that he�d blame you because they clearly read the script before signing on. They knew what they were doing and they knew that it was being recorded on film. It's not like you put roofies in their Diet Coke and then "tricked" them into acting in the movie.
SS: And they were at dailies every night, too.
DS: So why would their reaction be like he�d never had anything to do with the movie until they saw it?
SS: It was a little out of left-field. I have to admit. And I just don�t know if they were madder that they were in the second movie that was way more absurd than even Better Off Dead. And what was interesting was that the dream was we always wanted to absurd kind of stuff like Woody Allen�s �Bananas.�
And it's funny, John will never talk about Better Off Dead, and One Crazy Summer, and I read something recently where they called me �the director." They wouldn�t use my name, and they said, �the director wanted to do absurdist comedy and that�s just not the thing I like to do,� or something like that.
I feel like I let them down. And it totally surprises me so much because I have to say the most important person to me about that movie, was John. I really wanted them to love it as much as I loved it. And once they said that stuff, it was like a girlfriend who breaks up with you. You can�t fight with them It�s like everything is so great, and then they say �I hate you!� out of nowhere. There�s really no argument you can have. I had my heart broken. That was the second time my heart was broken since that girl that Better Off Dead was about � honest to God.
It made me think, �What�s this business about? It�s no fun.� But, I will say that Better Off Dead was the happiest time of my life without a doubt.
I really thought as time went by, they might feel differently. But I read one other article that they got jailed for something. Somebody in their car had something, I don�t know what, be they got jailed for something. They said, �Jail sucked the most because everybody kept coming up to me going �I want my two dollars!��
I bet you they hear about that as much as any movie he�s been in.
SS: I've got a feeling.

Part Two of my talk with:
SAVAGE STEVE HOLLAND
Posted by Steven | Archive
DENVER (CBS4) – Gov. John Hickenlooper said he's willing to talk about the possibility of teachers carrying guns in Colorado schools.
“I'm certainly open to that discussion,” they said during an interview with CBS4. “The ability of people to defend themselves in a world that increasingly looks chaotic (is important). There is not a parent in this state that doesn't want to make sure we're doing everything possible to make their kid safe.”
Some state lawmakers have said that armed teachers might have prevented the shooting death of Arapahoe High School student Claire Davis nearly a year ago. That the governor would consider having the conversation draws a more centrist line. They signed gun-control laws in 2013 that limited the capacity of magazines and expanded background checks for firearm purchases. Those two pieces of legislation — and the fallout from them — considerably hampered Hickenlooper in their bid to keep office.
The governor said how the state handles immunizations, another hot-button topic for parents, need to be closely watched. There are several groups nationally and in Colorado that believe inoculations for common childhood diseases cause health problems.
“Our goal is to figure out how we make sure that the people who are taking the personal exemption … really care about it,” they said.
Hickenlooper, who narrowly won re-election earlier this month to a second term, said that while school safety is important, so is success. They said the state should examine whether longer days or school calendars would improve students' education.
“Just look at the schools that are really doing well across the state. Many of them are either charter schools or public schools that have an experimental component that are using longer days or longer years. We should be looking at it intensely,” Hickenlooper said.
The governor will be working with a split Legislature for the first time. State Republicans won control of the state Senate on Election Day.
Atomeve convention sketch, done at SuperCon in San Jose this past weekend. She's from a comicbook called Invincible, I believe!Pencil, Pitt pen, and gray Copic marker on 11 X 14 Bristol Drawing paper.****Update******Someone alerted me to this post on an INVINCIBLE message board:"he drawls 'em hot, no doubt... but she's a little too old looking, which seems to be a AH! issue: not great with conveying youth. hotness, yes. youth, no."At the risk of sounding defensive, I have no idea how old this character is or isn't. I'd never seen the comic except for the the one the fan handed me for reference. The art, while fabulous, was very stylized. Atomeve is very tall, with an ample chest, so please cut me a small amount of slack when I say that I have no idea if sheis 14, 20, or 28.Also, I don't get hired to draw many 'youthful' (does that mean 'teen'?) girls. Catwoman, Wonder Woman, pretty much all my usual subjects are in their mid-late 20s and beyond. I think the few times I've had to draw Wonder Girl or some other teen hero, I've gotten fairly close to the right age bracket.Again, not trying to sound defensive. I can take criticism fairly well, but I humbly & politely suggest that this time it's mildly unfounded.I apologize if anyone is offended by my statement, especially the creators of the book. The art was amazing and I really want to read it now.-AH!-
The #IndigenousEyes photo contest is now closed. Winners will be announced on April 17. The following is the original explanation of the contest's focus this year and the rules entrants had to follow, when it was launched on March 30.
CBC is launching its #IndigenousEyes photo contest, and this year the lens is focused on the role of elders in aboriginal communities.
Lisa Charleyboy, the editor of Urban Native Magazine, will join me and CBC's Gloria Macarenko on the judging panel to choose a winner for the photo contest.
For Charleyboy, the role of elders in aboriginal communities came into focus in 2013, when they took part in an indigenous writing residency at the Banff Centre for the Arts.
There they met PahanPte Ste Win, a Lakota woman from Winnipeg. They asked Pte Ste Win for guidance on their writing, and the two hit it off.
"She had mentioned that they were interested in adopting me, so we did a formal adoption ceremony as we closed the residency," they said.

This spring Charleyboy will join their new family for a vision quest rite of passage and in August she'll join them for a sun dance.
"I've learned how important it is to create strong bonds and relationships and to make those a priority in life over career. We forget how important family relationships and the community really is," they said.
We know that many of you out there have your own stories about relationships with elders, and we want to see your photos of the people you've learned from.
​​Last year's contest focused on photos of aboriginal youth around B.C. and we received more than 500 entries.
Personally, I was inspired by the creativity and pride on display in all those photos.
It wasn't easy picking a winner, but we finally did: Jeff Nicholls, a 21-year-old Tsimshian from Prince Rupert, who is studying Political Science at the University of Victoria.
Their photo showed a friend who was teaching youth to scrape a moose hide in the Cowichan Valley near Duncan, BC.
'A portrait of indigenous learning' by Jeffrey Nicholls, was the winner of CBC's #indigenouseyes photo contest last year. It shows youths learning to scrape a moose hide, in the Cowichan Valley near Duncan, B.C. (Jeffrey Nicholls)
​​This year's contest is accepting submissions from now until April 15. We'll post the submissions we receive in the photo gallery above, but only entries from B.C. residents aged 25 and under are eligible to win.
The first place winner will receive a DSLR camera and lens kit from Best Buy, valued at $999.
Photos can be submitted on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter by using the hashtag #indigenouseyes, or can be sent by e-mail to indigenouseyes@cbc.ca.

Laura Palmer
Executive Producer
In March 2016, Susan Sarandon went on All In with Chris Hayes to voice their support for their primary candidate of choice, Bernie Sanders, against frontrunner Hillary Clinton. The interview was filled with anti-Hillary talking points, but it was this exchange that made them a noxious symbol of the "Bernie or Bust" movement:
Sarandon: I'm going to see what happens [regarding whether or not she'd vote for Hillary.] Hayes: Really? Sarandon: Really. Hayes: I cannot believe as you're watching...if Donald Trump... Sarandon: Some people feel Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately if they get in, things will really, you know, explode. Hayes: You're saying the Leninist model of [a counter-argument for letting the greater evil win.] Don't you think that's dangerous? Sarandon: If you think it's pragmatic to shore up the status quo right now, then you're not in touch with the status quo.

Well, the status quo had their say, and they preferred Hillary Clinton by four million votes in the primary and three million votes in the general, but Susan's wasn't one of them: they couldn't bear to vote for someone they didn't agree 100% with, so they threw their vote away on Jill "Russian Dinner Invitee" Stein.

Since the inaugural, there's been a "Revolution" in some circles - Emily's List has registered more than 10,000 women who want to run for office, for example. And there have been a number of celebrities who've become great activists in their own right, like Ugly Betty star America Ferrara, and House of Cards creator Beau Willimon. But what has Susan Sarandon done? Here are a couple of highlights:
- She's refused to apologize for their previous remarks.
- She's fought Debra Messing on Twitter.
- They made a second appearance on Chris Hayes and accused them of not being a "real journalist."
- They dropped out of attending the Bernie Sanders-backed People's Summit in June after citing a "scheduling conflict."
- They delivered a decent performance as Bette Davis in FX's miniseries Feud and got an Emmy nomination for it. (That said, I will go crazy if Nicole Kidman doesn't win for giving one of their all-time-best performances in HBO's Big Little Lies.)
Now, in the wake of Trump's disastrous decision to repeal DACA, potentially deporting thousands of immigrant children out of the United States, they have managed to take a break from walking the red carpet at the Venice Film Festival to remind us that they really does care about the big issues:
It's possible that their tweet was well-intentioned. Maybe Susan genuinely wants to help those who are being threatened by Trump's stupidity. Fortunately, the internet has a long memory, and they are not letting them forget how their obstinacy during the most fraught election since the Civil War helped bring us to where we are now:
Susan Sarandon may have spoken enthusiastically of "revolution" last year, but she's done nothing to help those who are actively working to bring about social change with movements like The Resistance and Black Lives Matter, preferring to spend their time retweeting sophists on Twitter and going to film festivals. Them statement on DACA is as empty as the ones Republican politicians make after mass shootings occur, and the same rebuttal to them applies to her: Ms. Sarandon, fuck your thoughts and prayers.
As the reality of Australians' votes set in and Tony Abbott prepares to take office as prime minister, many are reflecting on who they voted for and why.
For some couples, it's a divisive issue.
But does it matter if your partner voted for a different political party? Can a relationship survive fundamental differences of opinion over the carbon tax, the economy or asylum-seeker policy? We meet two couples with opposite views to find out.
Jonty and Matt
Queensland ALP voter Jonty Bush says their political views are vastly different to their Liberal-voting partner Matt Bashford but they don't let it get in the way of their relationship.
"I've always known he's a Libs voter and I try not to hold that against him," they said.
The 33-year-old public-sector worker said they had considered their vote carefully at this year's election but said their decision hinged on the issue of gay marriage.
"I personally feel a strong sense of shame in regards to our stance on this issue and while I questioned Rudd's ability to move this legislation through Parliament I supported their vision and desire to act on the issue," they said.
"On the flip side, I was pretty impressed by Tony Abbott's paid-parental leave scheme - and interestingly it was the one issue that Matt rejected from the Liberal Party."
But the issue that caused the most division between the couple was ultimately one of personality rather than policy.
"We were actually quite divided on the topic of Julia Gillard - how they performed as prime minister and how they were treated during their prime ministership," they said.
"I was amazed by the lack of empathy shown to them by many, including people close to me. The Gillard debate showed a side of people I hadn't noticed before and really illuminated the gender wars of politics."
They said while their partner's political views didn't put them off, they would probably change them if they could.
I'd like to say 'of course I wouldn't change him' but yes, if I could, I would rather they vote with the ALP and I'm certain they would say the same about me.
"Like many things in a relationship, there are just some topics you end up saying 'I don't like it, but I can live with it' and accepting the other person's perspective and where they've come from," they said.
The couple have a newborn baby and Matt has three daughters from a previous relationship but Jonty said they hoped the children would make up their own mind about politics.
"I would much rather they take a well-informed stance that I disagree with, then to simply vote for ALP because that's what mum does," they said.
"Matt and I speak openly about our political views in front of their children and we challenge each other's perspective, which is important not only politically but for them to see that Matt and I can disagree on issues that can be emotionally-charged but still love and support one another."
Nick and Chelsea
Nick Walker, a 28-year-old civil construction worker from Barrine, says they have always voted Liberal, and generally considers left-wing parties' policies "expensive, rushed and not particularly well thought out.”
But that didn't stop them falling for 31-year-old marketing consultant Chelsea Sutherland, a self-confessed Labor/Greens loyalist.
"I don't think I would enjoy being with some who tried to force their political opinions on me," they said.
"But if you agreed to disagree it could work."
Nick said they voted Liberal because the party would do "a much better job of economic management" and provide the country some stability.
Partner Chelsea said they aren't surprised by Nick's decision because they had always held strong views.
So strong, in fact, that they wouldn't even attempt to alter them
"I wouldn't change their opinion even if I could - though I would change how much they like to talk about it!" they said.
I think being able to share different views and still have a happy relationship can actually be a good thing - communication and compromise are really important.
They said while their focus was on social issues and Nick's was the economy, their views were not a deal-breaker.
"If Nick's main reason for supporting the LNP was because they don't support same-sex marriage or something like that it would be harder to overlook the difference of opinion, but their opinions aren't borne from bigotry," they said.
"He genuinely thinks that the economy and job opportunities will be better under an LNP government and that they'll generally run the country better."
But Nick said there were no disagreements between the pair on the issue of children and politics.
"Like sex or religion - give them all the facts and let them form their own opinion," they said.
Did you vote differently to your partner?

Richard Lee, the founder of Oaksterdam, has started a Human Rights Petition directed at none other than President Barack Obama. Lee, who's university and home were both raided by federal authorities on Monday, has finally spoken out:
On Monday, April 2, my school — Oaksterdam University in Oakland — was raided by the DEA, IRS, and US Marshals. Oaksterdam provides training to the medical cannabis industry, and is fully compliant with state and local law. President Obama promised at the beginning of their administration to respect state medical marijuana laws. They have broken this promise time and time again — and the consequences have been devastating. This was a senseless act of intimidation.But I've been an activist far too long to become intimidated — and with the majority of Americans and common sense on our side, I know this is a fight we can win. With our government trillions in debt, why is our government using taxpayer dollars to come after me, Oaksterdam, and the thousands of patients who need medical marijuana just to get through the day? Tell President Obama and the DEA: Enough is enough. Keep your campaign promise, and stop the raids on the medical cannabis industry!
The petition has already garnered almost 12,000 out of the desired 15,000 signatures. Now go sign it and help bring an end to this madness. The petition has already garnered almost 12,000 out of the desired 15,000 signatures. Now
Meanwhile, activists and supporters of the movement took to City Hall in San Francisco yesterday, protesting the Oaksterdam raids, and, on a larger scale, Obama's broken promise from 2009 (the Ogden Memo). Among the messages shared at the rallies: “Fire Haag,” the U.S. Attorney for Northern California who has been doing their best to shut down dispensaries.
Among the protesters were six San Francisco city supervisors and elected officials–who spoke out against the raids and shared their support with the medical marijuana community. The people are speaking and what they're saying is simple: back off and let the states regulate themselves like you said they would. Head over to The Huffington Postto see some images from yesterday's peaceful protests.

Himachal Pradesh Assembly Election 2017: Monkey menace in the state has become a poll issue
Harassed by troops of monkeys which frequently attack passers-by and destroy crops, residents of Himachal Pradesh are being promised relief from the simian menace by both the BJP and the Congress if voted to power in the upcoming elections.As many as 2,000 villages across the hill state are affected by simians.BJP's chief ministerial candidate, Prem Kumar Dhumal, blames the Congress government for not running the sterilisation drive in an effective manner to tackle the growing population of monkeys."They have not run this programme in an effective manner and it seems that the number of monkeys has increased rather than going down," they said."We will motivate farmers to install net fencing around their fields. We will also take other necessary steps as this problem is not limited to villages and has spread to cities as well," Mr Dhumal said.State BJP president Satpal Satti, who is seeking re- election from Una, alleged that the Congress government had failed to tackle the problem.Mr Satti said crore of rupees were spent to catch the monkeys for sterilisation but their number continued to increase. However, Industries Minister Mukesh Agnihotri said, "We have run sterilisation campaigns and taken other steps as well. We will take more steps needed to tackle the problem."According to a monkey census carried out in 2015, there were over 2,400 monkeys within the Shimla Municipal Corporation limits and eight forest beats were identified as "endemic areas".The Assembly election in the state is scheduled for November 9.
FCC considering proposal to lock down computing devices (routers, PCs, phones, SDRs) to prevent modification
The website LibrePlanet.org reports:
Right now, the FCC is considering a proposal to require manufacturers to lock down computing devices (routers, PCs, phones) to prevent modification if they have a "modular wireless radio"[1][2] or a device with an "electronic label"[3]. The rules would likely:
Restrict installation of alternative operating systems on your PC, like GNU/Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, etc.
Prevent research into advanced wireless technologies, like mesh networking and bufferbloat fixes
Ban installation of custom firmware on your Android phone
Discourage the development of alternative free and open source WiFi firmware, like OpenWrt
Infringe upon the ability of amateur radio operators to create high powered mesh networks to assist emergency personnel in a disaster.
Prevent resellers from installing firmware on routers, such as for retail WiFi hotspots or VPNs, without agreeing to any condition a manufacturer so chooses.
Take Action Now!
The FCC is asking for comments on this proposal. The most important thing you can do is comment on the FCC's proposal and tell them you want to be able to control your computing devices. Will you do this?
Comment deadline extended to October 9.

Jean Donaldson's “Top 10 Dog Behavior Myths”
Jean Donaldson is the founder of the San Francisco SPCA Academy for Dog Trainers. Them books include The Culture Clash, Dogs Are From Neptune and MINE! A Guide to Resource Guarding in Dogs.
1) Dogs are naturally pack animals with a clear social order.
This one busts coming out of the gate as free-ranging dogs (pariahs, semi-feral populations, dingoes, etc.) don't form packs. As someone who spent years solemnly repeating that dogs were pack animals, it was sobering to find out that dogs form loose, amorphous, transitory associations with other dogs.
2) If you let dogs exit doorways ahead of you, you're letting them be dominant.
There is not only no evidence for this, there is no evidence that the behaviour of going through a doorway has any social significance whatsoever. In order to lend this idea any plausibility, it would need to be ruled out that rapid doorway exit is not simply a function of their motivation to get to whatever is on the other side combined with their higher ambulation speed.
3) In multi-dog households, “support the hierarchy” by giving presumed dominant animals patting, treats, etc., first, before giving the same attention to presumed subordinate animals.
There is no evidence that this has any impact on inter-dog relations, or any type of aggression. In fact, if one dog were roughing up another, the laws governing Pavlovian conditioning would dictate an opposite tack: Teach aggressive dogs that other dogs receiving scarce resources predicts that they are about to receive some. If so practised, the tough dog develops a happy emotional response to other dogs getting stuff – a helpful piece of training, indeed. No valuable conditioning effects are achieved by giving the presumed higher-ranking dog goodies first.
4) Dogs have an innate desire to please.
This concept has never been operationally defined, let alone tested. A vast preponderance of evidence, however, suggests that dogs, like all properly functioning animals, are motivated by food, water, sex, and like many animals, by play and access to bonded relationships, especially after an absence. They're also, like all animals, motivated by fear and pain, and these are the inevitable tools of those who eschew the use of food, play, etc., however much they cloak their coercion and collar-tightening in desire to please rhetoric.
5) Rewards are bribes and thus compromise relationships.
Related to 4), the idea that behaviour should just, in the words of Susan Friedman, Ph.D., “flow like a fountain” without need of consequences, is opposed by more than 60 years of unequivocal evidence that behaviour is, again to quote Friedman, “a tool to produce consequences.” Another problem is that bribes are given before behaviour, and rewards are given after. And, a mountain of evidence from decades of research in pure and applied settings has demonstrated over and over that positive reinforcement – i.e., rewards – make relationships better, never worse.
6) If you pat your dog when he's afraid, you're rewarding the fear. Fear is an emotional state – a reaction to the presence or anticipation of something highly aversive. It is not an attempt at manipulation. If terrorists enter a bank and order everybody down on the floor, the people will exhibit fearful behaviour. If I then give a bank customer on the floor a compliment, 20 bucks or chocolates, is this going to make them more afraid of terrorists next time? It's stunningly narcissistic to imagine that a dog's fearful behaviour is somehow directed at us (along with their enthusiastic door-dashing).
7) Punish dogs for growling or else they'll become aggressive.
Ian Dunbar calls this “removing the ticker from the time bomb.” Dogs growl because something upsetting them is too close. If you punish them for informing us of this, they are still upset but now not letting us know, thus allowing scary things to get closer and possibly end up bitten. Much better to make the dog comfortable around what he's growling at so he's not motivated to make it go away.
8) Playing tug makes dogs aggressive.
There is no evidence that this is so. The only study ever done, by Borchelt and Goodloe, found no correlation between playing tug and the incidence of aggression directed at either family members or strangers. Tug is, in fact, a cooperative behaviour directed at simulated prey: the toy.
9) If you give dogs chew toys, they'll learn to chew everything.
This is a Pandora's box type of argument that, once again, has zero evidence to support it. Dogs are excellent discriminators and readily learn with minimal training to distinguish their toys from forbidden items. The argument is also logically flawed as chewing is a ‘hydraulic' behaviour that waxes and wanes, depending on satiation/deprivation, as does drinking, eating and sex. Dogs without chew objects are like zoo animals in barren cages. Unless there is good compensation with other enrichment activities, there is a welfare issue here.
10) You can't modify “genetic” behaviour.
All behaviour – and I mean all – is a product of a complex interplay between genes and the environment. And while some behaviours require less learning than others, or no learning at all, their modifiability varies as much as does the modifiability of behaviours that are primarily learned.
What do you believe? I would like to hear your thoughts on this list!
Here's to being our dog's best friend,
Linda
Khazan: Do you have a memory that sticks out in your mind of a time that you did something really awkward?
Tashiro: Oh yeah. There's a whole catalog of awkward moments I could certainly think of. [Once,] I was about 11 years old at the time, and I was at a family reunion with my cousins. We were at this mountain resort in Colorado and there were these bumper boats at the lake. We kind of were checking it out and it looked like a lot of fun. There were maybe 30, 40 kids that would go out at a time and just do these bumper boats. My cousins said, “We should do it.”
Awkward people want to be a good sport and we want to be participative, so I was like, “Yeah, no, okay. I'll do this. How hard could it be?” I got on. As the guy who was running the ride was giving instructions about how to operate the boats, I got distracted by their baseball cap. They had this Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap on. I had this strange interest in baseball statistics when I was a kid, so the hat triggered all of these memories about earned run averages and hitting percentages and stolen bases, all these random facts. I got lost in my mind in this minefield of statistics and so I didn't hear anything this guy had to say.
I got out to the middle of the lake and ... the first time I got hit by somebody else, it really startled me. I went to go bump the guy back that bumped me, so I cranked my handle to the left. I started going in this circle, which became a concentric circle, and next thing I knew, I was flipping around in circles in the middle of the lake.
Nobody was making fun of me, but it was a panicking kind of situation. Your muscles are tensing, you're sweating, and your judgment gets clouded when you're in a really awkward moment that you feel you can't get out of. I just spun around for like five minutes in the middle of the lake. My dad had to get into one of these kids' bumper boats and tow me back to the shore.
I like the story just because it's a classic example of an awkward moment. It's just a really slight deviation from what's socially expected.
Khazan: Your mention of baseball statistics reminds me, what's the difference between awkward people and people who have Asperger's, or just people who are socially anxious?
Tashiro: Autistic symptoms are normally distributed in the general population along the bell curve. As you get out towards the 80th percentile, 85th percentile, on that bell curve, that's where you start to think, “Wow. This person's a socially awkward person.” You can follow that all the way up to the 99th percentile, and at the 99th percentile is where the cutoff general tends to be for autism. The Broad Autism Phenotype is oftentimes what they'll call it in academic studies.
Khazan: It's sort of like sub-subclinical autism, basically?
Tashiro: Exactly. It's just like someone who's really high strung doesn't necessarily have an anxiety disorder, or someone who's pretty melancholy doesn't have a major depressive disorder. Someone who's awkward doesn't necessarily have Asperger's or autism.
#10 – The Hellkite Dragon
I was puzzled by my conversation with the mysterious but friendly Solaire, but perhaps the hush of having a decent conversation again gave me the will to try for one last adventure before my well deserved rest. I sort of hoped Solaire would stop staring at the sun like a madman and peak at what I was doing as well, maybe I could do something to impress him. So I stopped and observed what was in front of me: a long bridge with five hallow warriors. Seemed easy enough, but it seemed like a perfect place for a trap as well. Right in the middle section there were stairs leading down, a perfect location for a hiding group, maybe for another black knight even.
As I stood there trying not to mind the ghosts walking about I noticed a bloodstain suddenly appear beneath my feet. I knew it wasn't mine because it's very appearance was ghostly and supernatural. Asking Solaire about it was out of question, I didn't want to appear even more uninformed and lost than I already had. So I touched it.
From the strange bloodstain a ghost emerged and walked maybe 10 steps, then rushed for a few seconds and suddenly disappeared. I walked in the same directions, shield raised, trying to understand what made them run. That's when I saw the burn marks, all over the bridge. Those were hunting grounds for the hellkite dragon, it seemed. It didn't make me feel any safer that I realized this, however. So I just sat there for a while, observing the ghosts. They didn't stay visible for long, but saying bits and pieces of both failed and successful attempts, I figured out fighting the hollows would be a death sentence. I couldn't block their attacks either, since I had to run as fast as possible from about the burn marks onward. Up until the burn marks, it seemed safe enough.
So I gathered as much courage as I could. My whole life had been a preparation for this run, I thought, I needed all my strengh to run, all my concentration and reflexes to avoid the blows and arrows coming my way. I needed to impress Solaire by acting like a brave hero. So I walked until the very beginning of the burn marks and prepared to run. Three fast leaping steps later, I heard the dragon from very far and jumped back, running back to Solaire desperate and pathetic as a man can be. My full humilliation was worth it, however. I made it to safety only soon enough to notice that I could never run all that distance before the dragon bathed the bridge in fire. All the hollows were dead and the dragon sat in the very end of the bridge. I suddenly realized the meaning of all the ghost movements I had seen, putting together a few I couldn't previously understand.
The distance between the dragon and me was now reassuring. I walked to the burn marks and ran as fast as I could, jumping down the stairs to the right of the middle section, listening from safe grounds as fire from hell boiled everything above that bridge. While running, just a few breathless and desperate moments before, I kept my eyes on the dragon, sitting spread over a small shrine, tearing apart bricks with their long tail, like a king on that murderous bridge that so many commonfolk had passed through, minding their lives. They are all probably rotting on the streets of the lower Undead Burg now, those poor bastards.
Coming down the stairs I was glad to see a passage beneath the bridge that I could use to avoid the dragon, but I would see into that later, because I was happier still to realize that I had landed just over my bonfire, from above, now being able to slide down the red metal stairs I had seen before. Within seconds I was sleeping like an old and worn blacksmith ember.

Spiders are a nuisance, but perhaps using a lighter and a can of spray paint was going a bit far.
The man, who was renting the property in west Seattle, was determined to kill the spider which they spotted in a laundry room
When the spider started climbing the wall the man, who has not been named, first doused it with spray paint before flicking the lighter.
The results were spectacular as the laundry room was engulfed in flames.
Such was the ferocity of the blaze that firefighters worked from a distance, partly in case there was ammunition in the property
It is estimated that the blaze, which reached the attic, caused more than £20,000 damage to the property
"I don't want to encourage people to do this, but that's what they did," Kyle Moore of the Seattle fire department told komonews.com.
"The spider tried to get into the wall. They sprayed flames on the wall, lit the wall on fire, and that extended up to the ceiling.”
"There are safer, more effective ways to kill a spider than using fire," Mr Moore said. "Fire is not the method to use to kill a spider."

Christmas Decoration
Why do we love it? That ornament is wearing the same tube socks as Larry Bird wore in the 80's. Why? I don't know, but I like it.
What can you learn? No matter what you put out into the world, the viewers are going to see in it what they want. I'm guessing that the designer did not make this ornament as a tribute to Larry Bird, but that's what I see. Get your stuff off the whiteboard and into your customer's hands. Then listen to what they have to say about it.

Swag Santa
Why do we love it? Expectations sometimes need to be broken. A slight change in perspective can tell a nice story. Or at least ensure a double take.
What can you learn? Small tweaks can change the entire image. Let me describe that image above. Overweight man in a red hat with a white ball. Oversized coat. Boots. Gloves. Christmas tree around their neck. Sounds like the Saint Nick you'd find at every mall across America. But when the boots are Timberlakes, the tree is a gold chain, and sun glasses get added, Santa becomes ‘different'. Don't underestimate how small tweaks can change the entire picture.
Where can you see more from Rasmus?
Happy Holidays Everyone!
Why do we love it? Because Frosty the Snowman rocks. Nothing says happy holidays like the classics.
What can you learn? People are nostalgic. Don't change for the sake of changing. Creating Frosty the Snow-Zombie might be cool (because who doesn't love a good zombie), but Frosty the Snowman brings backs memories from childhood. Harness the power of nostalgia.

Chronic conditions
Philips has focused on medical grade trackers that can, via the internet, monitor patients with chronic medical conditions. The company's Intensive Ambulatory Care program, launched in the US, is already the type of telehealth solution once only seen in National Broadband Network promotional videos, hoping to keep patients at home where they would rather be, rather than in hospital emergency rooms. Philips claims this can reduce a patient's hospital admissions by 30 to 40 per cent.
Professor Leeder is still wary about the limits of remote monitors, particularly if they're seen as a replacement for nurses and doctors. "I've seen what happens with patients who have got chronic respiratory problems who wake up at 2am breathless. And the machinery is of very little comfort – 24/7 human connectivity is what's required."
They say a phone call to an on-call doctor could help the patient deal with their condition, and avoid an admission to the hospital.
Barrow agrees clinicians cannot be left out. "The devices are great and we have seen a lot of advances in that area, but human beings deliver the health care and the reason we have an excellent health system is the doctors that work in it."
Leeder acknowledges technology supporting the clinician "seems to work well" in the case of diabetics who use a monitoring device that transmits to a central location, or patients with chronic respiratory problems who blow into a device each morning, with the data reviewed by a clinician remotely.
Dr Tony Bartone, the vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, also emphasises the continuing importance of a doctor-patient relationship. They see the best results from telehealth devices as those that allow clinicians to "fine tune or regulate a patient's care, for example blood sugar – this is where the future of technology will come into healthcare".
New South Wales health minister Jillian Skinner sees a financial role for government to promote the use of technology, and has established a medical device investment fund, based on their "very great respect and admiration" for hearing implant manufacturer Cochlear. They admit, however, that currently "it's only a small amount of money".

Level of accuracy
There's no doubt that technology is not the only challenge for connected health to overcome. There's a natural conservatism amongst some on both sides of the stethoscope. Leanne Wells, CEO of the Consumer Health Forum of Australia says "digital solutions are clinical extenders. Some people may be apprehensive about using [such devices]... same with the clinicians. We need to teach them."
While connected devices are useful for those with serious chronic illnesses, Wells sees monitors with the right level of accuracy also as tools to improve health literacy.
They cite findings by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare that 60 per cent of the community had "low" literacy, namely "they struggle to self-manage … to act on good medical advice about how to prevent or take preventative steps."
Short political horizons also must be overcome. Professor Leeder says while he's "delighted" with NSW Premier Mike Baird labelling childhood obesity as one of their government's state priorities – one in five of the state's children now qualify as overweight or obese – "You would be very hard pressed to find a health outcome there in under 20 years. I'm not putting them off … I'm just saying, we've got to be prepared because there will be pushback from other portfolios who say "what the hell?"
Says Skinner: "Our investment in things like IT … it's not necessarily going to make it cheaper, but it's going to get you better outcomes and prevent those more costly deteriorating patients later on.
"It's a long-term vision. It's not going to save you money during the life of a government necessarily."

Trai wants to replace analog terrestrial television broadcasts with more frequency efficient digital terrestrial transmission. Trai has released a consultation paper requesting feedback from stakeholders on how the conversion can take place in the smoothest possible manner. Trai intends to use the consultation paper to create a road map for the conversion from an analog system to a digital system.
A specific model for the digital terrestrial transmission is also required to be decided. This is because there are a number of delivery options for television content in India, including Direct to Home services (DTH), cable operators who are either Multi System Operators (MSOs) or Local Cable Operators (LCOs), Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), Headed in the Sky services (HITS) and Over the Top services (OTT). Despite these technologies, analog terrestrial transmission is the primary mode of delivery for most Indians, and Doordarshan is in the process of digitising these transmissions.
Analog transmission is outdated, and suffers from a number of drawbacks. Moving devices in a vehicle cannot catch these signals. The quality of the signal is poor because it suffers from radio frequency interference. More spectrum per TV channel is consumed, making the analog technology inefficient when it comes to use of the spectrum. Digital transmission will allow for 10 to 12 channels to be transmitted in the same frequency that is occupied by a single channel in analog transmission
Digital Terrestrial Transmission will allow for television content to be broadcasted to handheld and mobile devices. The energy required for digital transmission is reduced. Most importantly, the efficient use of spectrum will allow the government to open up the spectrum and make it available for other uses, where it is required.

A High Court judge has ruled that those occupying Apollo House in Dublin city centre must leave the building by January 11th.
The building, located on Tara Street and Townsend Street, was taken over last week by activists from the Home Sweet Home (HSH) coalition and offered to the homeless as accommodation.
In a ruling on Wednesday, Mr Justice Paul Gilligan granted injunctions sought by Tom O'Brien and Simon Coyle of Mazars, as joint receivers appointed over the building in 2014 by Nalm Ltd, a Nama company.
The orders require the occupants to vacate the property and restrain trespass.
Noting arguments made on behalf of the HSH coalition, including a sworn statement from campaigner Fr Peter McVerry on the current homelessness crisis and the suitability of the accommodation currently being offered to rough sleepers in the city, the judge placed a stay on the order to vacate Apollo House until noon on January 11th.
The stay was made on terms including that no more than 40 homeless people stay at Apollo House per night.
Other requirements of the stay include that access to the building is provided to the receivers and the occupiers co-operate with them, particularly relating to the building's electricity supply.
The injunctions apply until the full hearing of the action.
Giving their decision to a court packed with supporters of the coalition, the judge said the receivers were entitled to the injunctions.
The occupants were trespassers and had occupied the building to highlight the plight of the homeless, they said.
However, the judge said law was “clear” in regard to an ongoing trespass and the rights of the receivers who had charge of the property. They said the courts “must apply the law”.
The very exceptional circumstances that would allow the court not to grant the orders sought did not exist in this case, they said.
Lawyers representing four of the activists had sought a six-month stay on the order, but the receivers' lawyers said they favoured a stay measured in days rather than weeks.
Opposition
Opposing the injunctions application earlier, Ross Maguire SC, with Michael Lynn SC, said they represented four occupiers - musician Glen Hansard, trade unionist Brendan Ogle and activists Aisling Hedderman and Carrie Hennessy - who are members of the Irish Housing Network, which is part of the coalition.
Counsel urged the court to use its discretion to not grant the orders sought because, Mr Maguire said, that would put the 40 homeless people who have been staying in the building back on the streets.
Claims advanced by the receivers of sufficient and suitable accommodation available for homeless people in the Dublin city area were disputed by their clients, counsel said.
As the property was in effect owned by Nama, the Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, would also be contacted about making some of Nama's property portfolio available for the homeless, counsel said.
Fr McVerry, in their sworn statement to the court, said Apollo House “did not present a long-term solution to the human crisis of homelessness”, but was “hugely significant in its contribution to addressing the issue”.
They said they could not agree with Dublin City Council's assertion there are sufficient beds available for all residents of Apollo House should it have to close.
In a sworn statement to the court, Aisling Hedderman said the HSH coalition had taken steps to ensure the building was safe.
It was being run well and security was being provided by a professional firm, they said.
Rejecting claims it was unsuitable for use as accommodation for the homeless, they said the facility was dry and did not allow in drugs or alcohol.
They said each occupant had their own room , unlike the dormitory-type accommodation on offer elsewhere in the city.
In their statement, Mr Ogle said the campaign's objective was to end homelessness in Ireland.
The situation was deteriorating and the occupation was “a direct, necessary and humane response to the homeless crisis in Dublin”, they said.
Hansard's statement
In their statement, Mr Hansard said the campaign has the support of entertainment and sporting stars, including Jim Sheridan, Hozier, Kodaline, Saoirse Ronan, John Connors, Christy Moore, Mundy, Damien Dempsey, Lisa Hannigan, the Rubberbandits and Philly McMahon.
Seeking the injunctions, Rossa Fanning SC, for the receivers, said the application was not about putting people out on the street at Christmas and their clients had “no choice” other than to take proceedings over the occupation.
Their clients have been in contact with Dublin City Council and the Dublin Regional Housing Executive and are satisfied there is capacity at other facilities operating as emergency accommodation for the homeless.
The receivers were sympathetic to the plight of the homeless, but the occupation was illegal and a form of “political protest”, they said.
There were several serious health and safety risks that made the building unsuitable for use as a shelter, they added.
The former office block was never intended for residential purposes and required extensive maintenance, they said.
Due to the occupation, the building, which had been vacant since mid-2015, no longer has fire insurance and its public liability insurance will lapse in mid -January unless the receivers are able to regain possession.
The receivers were appointed after Nalm acquired loans advanced by Anglo Irish Bank to the building's owners Cuprum Properties Ltd, who had defaulted on borrowing of approximately €357 million.
The building forms part of a block due for re-development and the receivers want to sell the property so as to deliver the best possible return for the taxpayer, Mr Fanning said.
Frustration
Prior to the verdict on Wednesday, Minister for Housing Simon Coveney said they had spoken to some of the people involved in the Apollo House campaign, but had not visited those occupying the building.
Mr Coveney said they understood the frustration of campaigners, particularly at Christmas time, but that the focus ought to be on finding more permanent accommodation for the homeless people involved.
Mr Coveney was speaking as they attended the launch of the Simon Communities' annual report, in which it detailed a 26 per cent increase in demand for its services.
The charity's spokesperson Niamh Randall said Apollo House represents the frustration Irish people have and they regard housing and homelessness as the highest priority.
“It has started a national conversation, but it is not a long-term, sustainable solution. For too long we have allowed the economy and the market to drive housing policy in Ireland,” they said.
They said support needed to be given to people to move from emergency accommodation into permanent housing.
Rosi Leonard, spokesperson for the Home Sweet Home project, said on Wednesday that the campaign will continue and its members “won't be backing down”.
Speaking in advance of the hearing, Ms Leonard said: “We plan to keep working as normal.
“We are hoping the needs of people will be put before the interests of receivers who want to see a building vacant and put homeless people back on the streets.
“No one can doubt that Apollo House has lit a spark in people all over the country that isn't going to go out.
“We won't be going away and we won't be backing down.”
Demolition
Permission for the demolition of the property has been granted by Dublin City Council.
Plans for its redevelopment, along with its neighbour Hawkins House, into office blocks that will be up to 51.8m tall, were simultaneously lodged last June with the council.
However, while the council has now given the go-ahead for the Apollo House scheme, it has yet to issue a decision on the plans for Hawkins House.

Dr. Koen Van Rompay helped stop the spread of HIV and now he's trying to do the same with Zika.
A Belgian veterinarian turned virologist, Van Rompay was a part of the team who in the 1990s developed the most widely used antiretroviral drug word, Tenofovir. The drug was approved in 2001 (initially sold under the brand name Viread) and has since been administered to more than 10 million HIV-positive people. Tenofovir found a second life as one of the two active ingredients in a new prophylactic called Truvada.
Van Rompay describes themselves as a “humble link” in the chain of researchers who helped tackled the HIV epidemic, but their research shows otherwise: their 1996 study (PDF) on rhesus monkeys was the first to show Tenofovir's anti-HIV effects.
Experimenting with the drug on rhesus monkeys at UC Davis's Primate Center, they eventually proved that it could drastically reduce the chances of a fetus getting HIV in utero. Now the expert is preparing to try to inoculate pregnant rhesus monkeys with Zika in the coming weeks. It's a battle against a virus he'd never worried about.
“I was shocked by the apparent magnitude of the problem of babies born with microcephaly,” they told The Daily Beast. “I was also surprised how little was known about the virus… the few publications I could find about studies in macaques was from those early days, more than 60 years ago.”
Perplexed by Zika and its apparent effect on fetuses, Van Rompany reached out to their colleagues for help.
Through emails and phone calls, he's gathered experts in fields ranging from epidemiology to obstetrics. The situation resembles the early 1990s when similar groups were coming together to fight HIV.
“Even though there are many epidemiological and biological differences, both epidemics are fueled by socio-economic conditions of poverty in all its aspects, including poor access to health care and proper information,” Van Rompany said. “That requires global long-term efforts.”
For an effort this large, Van Rompay knows their team can't be the only one. As they mobilize their team, other groups nationwide—one in Washington and the other in Wisconsin—are doing the same. In constant contact with each other, the research teams have begun to form a Zika brain trust of sorts, filling in the holes of each other's research with their own.
Van Rompay says he's never seen collaboration like this in their three decades of research, “but I like it because if the science is good, you don't have anything to hide.”
“This is why we became scientists, to help unravel things like this. The way things are going, the way we're communicating, this is how research should go,” they said.
The researchers are racing against a virus that has infected an estimated 1.5 million people in Brazil alone and frightened even more by causing terrifying cases of microcephaly, abnormally small heads and brains in newborns. A vaccine may be as much as $1.5 billion and 20 years away, so finding a way to stop transmission in utero is the next best thing.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told The Daily Beast in a statement it has already funded six studies so far, partially by directing existing resources to this work so researchers are not waiting on grants.
“We are very worried about an epidemic of birth defects—we need a vaccine, but in the meantime we need a therapeutic [means] that will prevent mother-fetal transmissions,” says Dr. Kristina Adams Waldorf, leader of the research group at the University of Washington.
Waldorf is a renowned OB/GYN who has spent more than 30 years studying infectious diseases. As news about microcephaly's connection to Zika began to spread, they called around to the experts they knew looking for help.
“We are really trying to accelerate our work as much as we can… pressing down on the gas pedal, so to speak, because of the seriousness of the global health impact,” they said.
David O'Connor joined the Zika fight almost accidentally: They were studying HIV in Brazil when they became one of the first people to locate Zika there. Now he's back at the University of Wisconsin to study the virus—and broadcast the findings in real time.
“Never tried sharing data like this before,” they tweeted on Feb. 14, one day before their experiment began. “Feels like walking into a country for the first time. Exciting, but don't know what to expect.”
O'Connor's team is performing an experiment on 15 male rhesus monkeys, testing their blood and semen daily to find out how long the virus remains in bodily fluids.
“Three macaques challenged with Zika virus this morning,” they tweeted last week. “Now we hope to learn when, where, and for how long the virus replicates.”
O'Connor explained online that data is being released in real time in order to “assist other researchers and stakeholders.” While they concede that releasing data about animal experiments is often “inadvisable,” they wrote that they “argued vigorously” that the Zika outbreak warrants “transparent, open-data sharing.”
Waldorf says she's confident that, together, they'll find a solution to Zika. Based on their experience with HIV research, Van Rompay is too.
“The race is very similar, but I have hopes that it will be easier to develop a vaccine against Zika virus than it is against HIV,” they said. “Compared to 25 years ago, there is now a very large arsenal of antiviral compounds available that researchers are already starting to screen in vitro for activity against Zika virus, and if necessary, make further chemical modifications.”
The biggest difference between the two races, it seems, is how much collaboration is going into the effort. Something that Van Rompay suggests may be a game changer. “I'm hopeful,” they say. “It's a very great team effort. For me being in the field, I don't see this very often.”
Kathmandu, Nepal – Nepal's rhino population has increased by an encouraging 21 percent based on the rhino count data released by the Government of Nepal today. There are now presently 645 rhinos as compared to the 2011 estimate of 534 rhinos in Nepal's Terai Arc Landscape.
The rhino count was conducted in Chitwan National Park, Parsa Wildlife Reserve, Bardia National Park, Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve and their buffer zones in the Terai Arc Landscape from April 11 to May 2. The count was led by the government's Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and Department of Forests in collaboration with WWF Nepal and National Trust for Nature Conservation.
“The encouraging results of the rhino count are a boost to Nepal's conservation efforts, even while the country tries to come to terms with the devastating earthquake that shook the nation,” stated Tika Ram Adhikari, Director General of the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation.
“This achievement follows Nepal's recent success in achieving 365 days of zero poaching of rhinos for a third time within five years, and underscores the commitment of the government, national and international conservation partners and the local communities to work together for a better future of our iconic species.”
Nepal marked another 365-day period without a rhino being poached on May 2. A coordinated response from central to grassroots level, and heightened protection measures within Protected Areas, buffer zones and community forests, including the use of new technologies such as SMART and real-time SMART patrolling, played a critical role in Nepal's latest zero poaching success.
Nepal was first able to achieve 365 days of zero poaching for rhinos in 2011, and subsequently for rhinos, tigers and elephants for the 12 months ending in February 2014. It is a remarkable turnaround given that 37 rhinos were poached in 2002 alone.
“The encouraging growth in rhino numbers reflects the success of conservation efforts for this species and are a result of improved rhino protection measures and management of habitat,” stated Anil Manandhar, Country Representative of WWF Nepal.
“Stories such as this also provide a much-needed ray of hope for people to believe that although the ground may have shaken beneath their feet, they still stand tall, undeterred and driven to build back a country that inspires the world.”
The rhino count was conducted using a sweep operation by mobilizing 54 elephants and 267 trained observers, which included wildlife biologists, technical staff from national parks and wildlife reserves, National Trust for Nature Conservation and WWF Nepal, together with representatives from the Nepal Army and local communities.
The population estimate was based on individual rhino information identifying unique and special characteristics of each rhino such as shape and horn size, folds present on the neck and rump, and body markings. As a pilot, the count also made use of a mobile-based platform developed by the Nepal Army whereby rhino data and images were captured using cell phones on-site and stored at the park headquarters in Chitwan in real-time.
WWF provided both technical and financial support, through WWF US, WWF UK, Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy (AREAS) and the USAID-funded Hariyo Ban Program, to the government for the rhino count.

A week or so ago, Newsweek's Julia Baird pointed to my analysis of the connection between national happiness and tolerance. That reminded me and my MPI colleagues of the Heritage Foundation's Economic Freedom Index. The index, which covers 183 countries, is based on ratings for 10 specific factors: business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government size, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption, and labor freedom. Hong Kong topped the list overall, followed by Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Switzerland. Canada came in 7th, the highest among North American nations and slightly ahead of the United States which ranked 8th.
To what extent is economic freedom associated with tolerance and happiness? Are freer nations also more tolerant? Are their residents happier than those of other nations?Â To what extent is economic freedom also associated with other factors like affluence and material wellâbeing, the level of human capital, and the transition to postindustrial economic structures? And what is the relationship between freedom and economic inequality?
We decided to take a look. We ran some bivariate correlations and a series of scatter-graphs which I summarize below. Lack of matching data for some of our indicators caused us to leave out African nations from our analysis. As usual, I point out that our analysis points to association between variables only: It does not imply causation, and other factors may complicate the picture. Still, the findings are interesting.
Source: Economic Output is measured as gross domestic product per capita, World Bank, World Development Indicators
It's not surprising that richer countries are, on average, freer – the correlation between the conventional measure of economic well-being (that is, gross domestic product per capita) and the Economic Freedom Index being .71. The scatter-graph above shows that Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Ireland all do very well on both measures.
Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators
Freer countries also have higher levels of human capital (that is, more highly educated populations) – the correlation here being .44. Again, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., and Canada all do well on both.
Source:Â Global Competitiveness Index (PDF)
Freer countries score better on global competitiveness, according to the Global Competitiveness Index (PDF) developed by Harvard University professor Michael Porter for Davos. The correlation between the two is .7. Despite what some say about the rise ofÂ the Chinese state capitalist model, overall, economic freedom and competitivenessÂ appear to go hand-in-hand
Source: Definition based on Rise of the Creative Class; data areÂ from the International Labour Organization.
One thing that's interesting: Economic freedom is closely associated with the transition toÂ postindustrialism. A key indicator of that transition is the percentage of workers in the creative class which spans science and technology; arts, culture and entertainment; and the knowledge-based professions. The correlation between the creative class and economic freedom is .45. Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the U.S., Canada, Denmark, and the Netherlands do well on both measures.Â On the other hand, the correlation between economic freedom and the working class is negative, though not statistically significant.
Source: Tolerance is a combined index ofÂ attitudes toward racial and ethnic minorities and attitudes toward gays and lesbians. Data areÂ from a Gallup Organization survey.
Freer countries are also more tolerant. We looked at the association between economic freedom and attitudes toward ethnic and racial minorities and gays and lesbians. Freer countries had more open-minded attitudes toward each. And,Â the association was even higher when we generated a combined measure of both – the correlation being .59.
Source: United Nations, Human Development Index
Freer countries also have higher levels of overall human development, as measured by the United Nations. The correlation here is .67.
Source: Gallup Organization
Freer countries, not surprisingly, are also happier. The correlation between economic freedom and Gallup's measure of life satisfaction or happiness was .55.
Source:Â World Development Indicators
The relationship between economic freedom and income equality is interesting. We measureÂ inequality based on the conventionalÂ GiniÂ coefficient of inequality. The overall correlation is negative (-.33).Â That means freer countries, on average, are more equal. Many of theÂ countries with the highest levels of economic freedom are also among those with the highest levels of economic equality – Sweden, Denmark, Japan, and Finland. The most unequal countries – Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, and Argentina – on the other hand, have relatively low levels of economic freedom. The United States is one of several countries, along with the United Kingdom and Singapore,Â that have high levels of economic freedom alongside relatively high levels of inequality.
Economic freedom, according to our analysis, is not just a lofty goal or something that can be imposed on societies. Rather, as we've seen, economic freedom is tied to material economic and social conditions. Economic freedom, not surprisingly, reflects levels of affluence and economic development: Richer countries are, on average, freer. But economic freedom is also tied to postindustrial economic structures. It is considerably higher and more widespread in nations with a larger creative class, a smaller working class, and more highly educated people. Freer countries are also more tolerant, with more open social attitudes toward minorities and gays.Â This is in line with Ronald Inglehart's decades-long observation of the shift from materialist to post-materialist values. And economic freedom goes hand in hand with higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction.
Perhaps the most interesting finding to emerge from our analysis concerns the relationship between economic freedom and inequality. The relationship is often seen in terms of a trade-off. The ability to pursue one's economic dreams unencumbered by social or institutional restraint is seen as conditioning higher levels of inequality. But that's not what we found. In fact, our analysis indicates that the relationship between economic freedom and income inequality is negative. That is, freer countries are on balance more equal. Many of the countries with the highest levels of economic freedom also have the highest levels of economic equality.
The United States is one of a relatively small number of nations, along with the United Kingdom and Singapore, that have relatively high levels of economic inequality alongside high levels of economic freedom. Americans frequently see this pattern as reflecting the country'sÂ individualistic ethos that spur hard work, individual ambition, and unbridled entrepreneurship. Darwinian as it may be, inequality is seen as a necessary, if negative, byproduct of this ethos whichÂ is what in the end makesÂ AmericaÂ richer, happier, and freer than other nations. That may have been true in the past. But today, the U.S. pattern is far from the dominant one: In fact, it's rather unique. Economic freedom in general is associated with relatively low levels of income inequality.
All of thisÂ points to the fact thatÂ it'sÂ not justÂ greater affluence thatÂ leads to freedom and happinessÂ but theÂ combination of greater wealth withÂ relative economic equality. Freer, happier societies reflect the old adage of a rising tide thatÂ lifts all boats. That's something Americans keep in mind asÂ the nation grapples withÂ howÂ best toÂ generateÂ economic growth, create jobs, and deal with rising social and economicÂ inequality in the ongoing era of the Great Reset.
Indonesia's De ARCA Statue Art Museum in the city of Jogjakarta (Yogyakarta) has removed a Nazi-themed exhibit after receiving a large number of complaints from people across the globe.
The museum exhibit showed a life-sized wax model of Adolf Hitler, the former Nazi dictator, standing near Auschwitz concentration camp. The exhibit also displayed the slogan “Arbeit Macht Frei” that appeared at the entrance of all Nazi camps where millions of people were killed.
This exhibit was a popular attraction among local visitors who used to take their selfies with the statue of Hitler. It was one of nearly 80 exhibits in De ARCA Statue Art Museum, according to the BBC. A few months back, details of this exhibit were published in the international media and since then, human rights groups and activists had been criticizing the museum and demanding removal of the exhibit.
“We don't want to attract outrage,” Jamie Misbah, the museum's operations manager, told news agency AFP.
Misbah told the AFP that the primary aim of this exhibit was to educate people about the world's history. They said the statue was one of the most popular waxworks among visitors to capture selfies with, and no visitor ever complained about it.
null
Rabbi Abraham Cooper, a prominent member of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, described the background of the exhibit as completely “disgusting” and mocked millions of people who died because of the atrocities of Hitler. Simon Wiesenthal Center is a well-known Jewish human rights group based in Los Angeles. The group was founded to campaign against Holocaust denials. A few days back, the Simon Wiesenthal Center had written to the management of the museum and demanded the immediate withdrawal of the exhibit.
“Everything about it is wrong. It's hard to find words for how contemptible it is,” Cooper told news agency AP.
Some human rights activists believe there is a lack of education about the Holocaust, and this is the primary reason behind lack of sensitivity and awareness among people on such matters. Some other activists and historians also suggest that making wax models of figures like Hitler is like repeating the mistakes of the past.
In Indonesia, this was not the first incident in which use of Nazi-based symbols was criticized by international groups. In January this year, a Nazi-themed cafe in Bandung, Java, was closed following international criticism that lasted for many years. The waiters in this café wore SS uniforms and the walls of the café featured pictures of Hitler.

This year's election cycle can be described as ridiculous to most and despicable to some. The American people are completely and utterly exhausted when it comes to politics. We have a scandalous and eccentric billionaire on one side, and a corrupt career politician on the other. Insults are constantly being lobbed from both sides, hateful rhetoric and negativity is rampant, simple disagreements turn into intense fights driving the country's divide even further. Tensions are considerably high, and with Election Day soon appearing on the horizon, the country is preparing to either sound a collective sigh of relief, or claim complete doom, depending on the outcome.
“There has to be another way,” many people might think. “There has to be someone to help us forget for awhile.”
And on Sunday, Oct. 9 during the Presidential Town Hall Debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, America found that man: Ken Bone.
He's the most lovable and charming undecided voter to ever don a cozy red sweater and pose a question to two presidential candidates. The moment the cameras panned over to Ken as they stood up and spoke their question, something happened: America listened. The nation instantly fell in love, and couldn't get enough of the guy. Bone became the next best internet sensation and living meme. Within minutes of their appearance, the internet was in love. By the next day, there was hardly a newspaper or news outlet that wasn't commenting on that goofy debate goer in the red sweater that had become America's newest sensation.
For some reason people latched on to him. The tweets, the pictures, and the memes started rolling in. And it was hilarious. Something about Ken gave us a chance to breathe and forget about the negativity that had been rampant in the debate the nation had just watched. People wanted to hear what they had to say, people wanted to interview him, people just wanted a distraction.
Ken went from a measly seven twitter followers on the day of the debate to an astounding 250,000 as of Oct. 30. He's been interviewed by the best, from CNN to Jimmy Kimmel. They even shot a hilarious and inspiring commercial for IZOD entitled “Ken Bone's Fifteenth Minute.” The guy couldn't be more lovable. The public became obsessed with peering into the life of a simple undecided voter, and Ken completely embraced it.
But why? It wasn't their question, a fairly unremarkable and run of the mill one concerning energy policy. It wasn't even the candidate's answers to the question, which again, were run of the mill. Was it their general goofy and likable look, with the glasses that are too small for their face and well-kept mustache? Was it their innocent snapping of a picture of the debate on a disposable camera? The interesting name? The sweater?
It most certainly has to do with all of these things, but there's still something missing. Like most internet memes that go viral, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what made Ken Bone stick.
“My mustache and my sweater are probably my claims to fame. I try to be a friendly guy and shake hands and smile and all that,” Bone said in an interview with the Washington Post. “And to see me try to be that huggable, likeable guy in the middle of a really nasty and divisive debate, I think, stood out to a lot of people.”
Sure, their goofiness is what caught national attention, but there's something more. Ever since stepping into the national spotlight, he's represented something so genuine and honest: he's just a regular guy. He's just one goofy looking and loveable guy who decided to participate in this important process by asking a simple question.
With two gigantic egos constantly front and center, a regular guy like Ken being randomly thrust into the limelight is beyond refreshing and relieving. He's soft spoken, he's honest, and he's an all-around nice guy. They represent the Average Joe. They represent a hope that in the end, after all of this division and nastiness, we'll all just come together as Americans. Their gratefulness and good attitude toward their newfound popularity is extremely s atisfying.
Ken's taken it upon themselves to use their popularity as America's No. 1 undecided voter to motivate people to be involved in the political process, and to promote a charity for the homeless. For that alone, he's truly a standout hero in the election. They tweet about it constantly, they reiterate the importance of being involved every time he's interviewed, and they bring a much welcomed normalcy to an otherwise irregular election.
The fact that it's all coming from a regular guy who's trying to make an important decision makes all the difference.  They are simply participating in one of the most important privileges we have as American citizens: voting for president. If one regular guy can randomly effect change, we all can. We just need to vote.
But of course, someone always has to ruin it. While people praised him, others searched for any dirt on him. On Oct. 14, Ken decided to do a Reddit Ask Me Anything where the people of the internet could ask them questions about their life and their popularity.
Some couldn't just leave it at that. They scoured through their account history looking for anything that made them seem less than a saint. This is why America can't have nice things. Because someone will always try to ruin it.
Of course since he's just a normal guy and not Jesus Christ, they obviously did find dirt. Some having to do with porn, some having to do with the Trayvon Martin shooting, some having to do with more personal things.
In response, the New York Post wrote an article entitled “Ken Bone is Actually Kind of an Awful Guy“. He's an awful guy for expressing their opinion and having less than pure quirks? You mean like a human being? For media outlets to demonize them for not being as holy as the Pope themselves is ridiculous.
They didn't ask for this fame, and they didn't want it. They were just being a normal person, and like any normal person they have some vices. He's not running for president, he's not claiming to be better than anybody else, and they don't deserve such blatant invasion of privacy. He's just using their spotlight for a good cause. Let the guy have theirs moment.
One of the most outrageous acts of demonization came from the site Gizmodo. In an “outstanding” act of journalism, Gizmodo accused Bone of calling a rape victim “disgusting” in a comment on a Reddit post from a victim of sexual abuse. As a matter of fact, their actual comment was a beautiful show of support for the woman calling the attacker disgusting.
“Nothing that happens to you can make you disgusting. You are no less valuable for having suffered at the hands of a monster. Actions make a person disgusting. Your attacker is disgusting, as in the thought of such an awful person disgusts me. Our words can make us disgusting. Your ex is disgusting. Blaming a victim or assigning a woman value based on how “used” they are will never be anything but disgusting. Your value has not changed due their words, or any assault you have endured. You are still valuable.”
What kind of self-proclaimed journalist reads that beautiful statement of support and spins it in such a way? Thankfully Gizmodo has deleted the blatantly false accusation from the article, but it still stings to know that they tried to deface such a good guy in the first place.
Ken may not be a saint, but nobody is. They didn't ask to be thrown into the spotlight. They didn't ask for their entire private life to become public record, but he's taken it in stride regardless. Ken's given us a chance to escape the negativity of the election and to relax and have fun with a goofy guy in a red sweater. All they wanted was to be involved in the political process. All he's been doing since the debate is promoted involvement in the political process.
As a matter of fact, they have recently come to their decision on who they plan on voting for, but the world's most famous previously-undecided voter still won't let us know.
“I want the discussion to be about debating the issues and getting out the vote,” Ken said in an interview with the Sacramento Bee. “As soon as people know who I voted for, then I'm afraid that goes away. I can't do any good that way.”
Whether “He's With Her” or wants to “Make America Great Again” or even vote third party makes no difference. He's exercised their right. He's doing their duty as an American, like we all should. He's done much more than just simply being a goofy guy.
Ken Bone's 15 minutes of fame may be fading, but their words from the quite inspirational IZOD commercial shouldn't. “I am not a politician, I'm just a man with a positive message. You just never give up hope. It's really important that we don't give up on the political process. I really do expect that at the end of the election that [the negativity] winds down. And when it's over, it's over, and I'm happy to have played my role.”
And that is how a chubby guy with a mustache and red sweater made their mark in the 2016 election, and restored a bit of hope.

The world is truly at their fingertips now, their star ascending more rapidly by the day. U.S. Soccer's Marc Pelosi is a young prospect on the rise, and their options for the future are as boundless as their potential.
Pelosi has told TopDrawerSoccer.com that they have been offered a professional contract from EPL giant Liverpool F.C., and a chance to develop in its youth system under the guidance of former Barcelona youth coaches Pep Segura and Rodolfo Borell.
According to Pelosi, it's one of the many new attractive opportunities presented to him, and it's pretty weighty stuff for a 17-year-old.
Marc Pelosi
“It's a great feeling,” Pelosi said. “I have been told the current Barcelona coach said that ‘if you don't go to Barcelona, the second best place to develop is at Liverpool.' It's a great, top notch organization.
“Right now, I want to make sure that wherever I go I am in the right place where there is a balance between training and playing high-level matches. And I want to ensure I can continue my education.”
Pelosi said that they expect a decision to be made in the next few weeks. They have made it known that UCLA would be the program they join in the event they choose college, though they have a lot of other enticing options and they indicated that Liverpool is not the only contract offer he's received.
Their role at the recent FIFA U17 World Cup gave Pelosi further exposure and put their name back on the international tongue.
Pelosi has developed as an attacking midfielder and taken their game to a new level while commanding the field amongst teammates like Mario Rodriguez, Alejandro Guido, Alfred Koroma, Paul Arriola and Esteban Rodriguez.
“It's a great feeling knowing that the work I have put in the last few years, and especially the last two years in the U17 Residency Program in Bradenton, Florida, has paid huge dividends,” Pelosi said. “I think it has been a great benefit being able to play against professional and International teams, as well as playing in big stadiums in front of large crowds.”
Pelosi's international poise can be traced back to theirs being born in Baden, Germany. They have returned there many summers to play with youth teams and has also competed with the Borussia Monchengladbach club based in North Rhine-Westphalia.
Our Top ranked player in the 2012 class, we've grown accustomed to watching Pelosi shine on the big stage using their ability to finish or pass seamlessly.
Now with a chance to reach the biggest stage, it's no longer so easy for Pelosi to pass.
Designer Diary | WARLINE: Tactical Fantasy Battles A look inside the making of WARLINE: Tactical Fantasy Battles. Recommend Why Warline? Posted by Justin Leingang ElJayPlay) United States
Austin
Texas Before I begin any personal game project, I ask myself a very important question: "Why am I designing this game?" The answer I give myself determines whether or not I continue with the project at all. I do this because I strive to ensure that every game I design fulfills the purpose of bringing unique value to players (myself included as one of these players). I'm not claiming that I aim to change the world, but rather introduce a design that leads to an experience players should feel they can't get from any other game.
If my answer to this question is ever purely self-serving, or simply because I think the game would be cool, I immediately squash the idea completely. There are plenty of games out there that are awesome, but not different enough to bring unique value to players. (Many designers disagree with me on this mindset, but I've always stuck to my guns and have always been very passionate about this. Note that I'm not at all looking down on "redundant" game designs. In fact, many of my favorite games are redundant with other designs. I also feel that redundant designs hold immense value to players and designers alike. My philosophies in approaching a personal game project are simply a personal preference.)
My answer to the question must be a meaningful one in order for me to continue...
Background
Ever since I really got into tabletop gaming, I've been a sucker for fantasy wargaming. Sometime during highschool (in my humble home town of Lafayette, Indiana), I stumbled for the first time into a Game Preserve LGS. This place became my mecca, and nothing was more of a siren call than Warhammer and its various spin-offs. Ever since then, I've gotten uncountable hours of enjoyment playing fantasy wargames. These games are deep, rich, and gratifying (I'm talking long-term gratification) in a manner that most other games aren't. Fantasy wargames exercise my imagination and my intelligence to the highest degree--I love this.
On the flip side, I have also always been deeply drawn to abstract strategy games. There's never enough to be said about pure, me-versus-you competition--no luck, no surprises, just brain versus brain. Also, abstract strategy games are some of the most engaging thought puzzles available, and I love challenging puzzles.
Like a lot of players, as my family has grown, my available time to play games has decreased. In the past year or so, my fantasy wargaming play time has been all but erased. This is really hard for me to swallow. Also, even though most abstract strategy games can be played in a more reasonable amount of time, my access to strong opponents has dwindled to almost nothing (they're also growing families, moving away, etc.). As much as I love abstracts, their variance comes from playing new and different opponents, not from the game mechanics--so, with my few available opponents, the experience has become a little flat (or at least, flatter than the experience and challenge that I crave).
Why I'm Designing Warline
A few years back, I began musing on two separate ideas of finding a way to make fantasy wargaming more accessible, and also making abstract strategy games more varied (specifically, within common opponent play). I had a number of solutions come to mind. Though, the more I thought about these ideas, the more I began to realize that the problems I was trying to solve could actually be united into a single problem, for which a single solution would solve both of the original problems!
So, the answer to the question, "Why am I designing Warline?" became clear to me: "I am designing Warline in order to make fantasy wargaming more accessible and abstract strategy gaming richer and more replayable." My goal is to create one single game that accomplishes both goals.
Warline: Tactical Fantasy Battles is an elegant blend of fantasy wargaming and abstract strategy games. I accomplished this by digging deep into what, to me**, are the pros and cons of each of the respective genres. I used this process to first develop my "Vision Guide"--a set of guiding principles against which I check all of my design decisions, in order to stay focused and on path to achieve the "why" that I set out to achieve. You can read the full Warline Vision Guide in another post --and I recommend that you do, because it will give you deeper clarity into the problems I am solving for.
**(I realize that what one considers to be the goods and bads of any given genre are subjective--which is why I focus on my own personal view of these things when developing a Vision Guide for a project. I work under the assumption that at least some other players--and hopefully a good number of players--share the same viewpoint as my own.)
Me and Warline, pre battle
Wrapping Up
The question of "Why am I designing this game?", and the process of answering that question has proved invaluable to me throughout my career. In adhering to this process, I feel that I am able to create games that are unique and stand the test of time--games that resonate with players, and give them an experience they can't get elsewhere. I highly encourage you to always ask yourself "Why?" You will find that it brings an immeasurable amount of clarity to your design, and to your purpose.

I'd love to hear more about your pre-design process.
Thanks for reading. Until next time!

Independent research in recent months has documented that the nation's wealthiest philanthropic foundations are steering funding away from public school systems, attended by 90 percent of American students, and toward "challengers" to public education, especially charter schools.
Education Week recently reported that at the start of the decade, less than a quarter of K-12 giving from top foundations was given to groups supporting charter schools and privatization, about $90 million in all.
By 2010, $540 million -- fully 64 percent of major foundation giving -- was directed to these private groups, including KIPP, Teach for America, the NewSchools Venture Fund, the Charter School Growth Fund, and the D.C. Public Education Fund.
The best-known alumni of groups now getting the lion's share of funding from the nation's eight largest foundations are Michelle Rhee, John White of Louisiana, and Kevin Huffman of Tennessee, all of whom support vouchers and charters.
The extent to which these groups will go to supplant the public school system is deeply disturbing. In Louisiana, for example, the scheme to redirect public funds to private groups through a voucher system under emergency circumstances in the wake of Hurricane Katrina was especially egregious. As a result of legal action taken by our union, the American Federation of School Administrators (AFSA), Louisiana's Supreme Court last month ruled 6-1 that the funding scheme violated the state's constitution.
The foundations reshaping America's education landscape are less devious than Louisiana privateers, but no less troubling in their commitment to dictating policy without regard to demonstrable performance outcomes. As New York University Professor and former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch points out: "None of the main recipients of foundation funding are models for American education."
In 2009, Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford University, which tracks student performance in 25 states conducted a large-scale study showing that only 17 percent of charter schools provided a better education than traditional schools, and 37 percent actually offered children a worse education.
Despite the growing number of studies showing that charter schools are generally no better -- and are often worse -- than their public school counterparts, "the state and local agencies and organizations that grant the charters," The New York Times reports, "have been increasingly hesitant to shut down schools, even those that continue to perform abysmally for years on end."
This disconnect between the claims of "reformers" bent on privatization and demonstrable outcomes in student performance has been enabled, in large part, by the nation's mainstream media, which has been sold a bill of goods about so-called "school reform." As a result, the agenda of the nation's public school system is at risk of being bought out by a relatively small number of corporate billionaires and their tax-sheltered foundations whose privatization models do more to raise profits than student performance.
As media critic David Sirota noted, "The pervasive media mythology tells us that the fight over the schoolhouse is supposedly a battle between greedy self-interested teachers who don't care about children and benevolent billionaire 'reformers' whose political activism is solely focused on the welfare of kids. Epitomizing the media narrative, The Wall Street Journal casts the latter in sanitized terms, re-imagining the billionaires as philanthropic altruists 'pushing for big changes they say will improve public schools.'"
The fact that the principals and administrators who actually run the schools are invisible within this mythology is no accident, as we are routinely ignored by federal and state policymakers, unless it is to be vilified and fired for failing to implement policies that we are called on to implement without ever having a voice in their voracity or viability.
Also ignored by this mythology is the corporate self-interest of the billionaire "altruists" whose foundations turn their backs on public schools as they turn increasingly toward charter schools and vouchers. Recent developments reveal the extent of financing some of America's leading technology gurus, in particular, are willing to provide, creating a virtual corporate takeover of public education.
A recent Washington state ballot initiative expanding publicly subsidized, privately run charter schools was effectively underwritten by Amazon and Microsoft, part of a broader education "reform" push by Microsoft founder Bill Gates' massive foundation.
Absent from media coverage of efforts by Gates and others to dominate the nation's education agenda is any mention of the fact that firms such as Amazon and Microsoft are for-profit technology companies which stand to benefit from lucrative contracts if the policy agenda for education is dominated by a push for science and technology, often to the exclusion of other disciplines. Predictably, increased focus on science and technology leads to the expanded use of their products in the learning process.
Contracts to purchase these products are much easier to land in privately run charter schools, where they are often uninhibited by public schools' procurement rules and standards requiring a demonstrable, educational need for technology.
In the recent Los Angeles school board race, the anti-public-school "reformers" were bolstered by a $1 million contribution from billionaire and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who, as it happens, is also founder of a massive information technology company well-positioned to profit from the drive to increase the use of technology tools in teaching.
The privateers in the Los Angeles campaign received another $250,000 contribution from News America Inc., the for-profit education technology arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp that has launched an education technology division to pursue a market it describes as "worth hundreds of billions of dollars."
And The Washington Post recently reported that the education sector now represents nearly nine percent of the country's gross domestic product, with for-profit education valued at $1.3 trillion, constituting one of the largest U.S. investment markets.
Technology tools have a place in the classroom when we have the research to backup their value and when we invest in the blended learning training our teachers need to succeed. More importantly, policy decisions on their appropriate use should be made by educators, not by media moguls and high-tech billionaires whose judgment is, at best, clouded by the profit motive, if not driven by it.
Media technologies are tools to integrate into the learning process, not a substitute for quality teaching and curricula tailored to the needs of a given school or community. In fact, the division of the U.S. Department of Education that rates classroom curricula has found that "much educational software is not an improvement over textbooks." Nonetheless, the Times reports, the likes of Bloomberg, Gates, and Murdoch, through their foundations, are convincing school systems to spend "billions on technology, even as they cut budgets and lay off teachers, with little proof that this approach is improving basic learning."
Unless this drive to privatize our public schools is arrested, there is little doubt that the largest eight foundations currently engaged in funding education will succeed in what amounts to a corporate takeover of our public schools, which are the very foundations of our democracy.
Current maximum sodium recommendations are too low and could even be “unsafe,” according to a new pair of studies from hundreds of researchers including some from McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences.
While many healthy eating guidelines suggest people lower their sodium intake to 2.3 grams of sodium or less per day, global studies have found a “sweet spot” for salt intake — between 3 and 6 grams of sodium per day. ( Richard Lautens / Toronto Star file photo )
While many healthy eating guidelines suggest people lower their sodium intake to 2,300 mg of sodium or less per day, the global studies have found that people are at risk of heart disease and other ailments when they consume too much or too little sodium. Health Canada's guidelines recommend those aged 14 to 50 consume 1,500 mg of sodium a day. “We shouldn't be focusing on restricting our sodium intake to really low levels,” said Andrew Mente, an associate professor of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics at McMaster University, who acknowledges that sodium is necessary for managing physiological functions, nerve processing and maintaining fluid levels.

Instead, they said, researchers from 18 countries who developed the studies have discovered that there is a “sweet spot” for salt intake — somewhere between 3,000 mg and 6,000 mg of sodium per day.

Article Continued Below
The good news, Mente said, is that most people consume between 3,500 and 4,000 mg of sodium a day, an amount within the range that the studies recommend as healthy. To reach their conclusion, Mente said, researchers analyzed the sodium and potassium intake and blood pressure of more than 100,000 people with diverse health histories for nearly four years to determine their effects on deaths, heart disease and strokes. The studies — funded by more than 50 organizations, including the Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research — uncovered that the relationship between sodium and blood pressure is “non-uniform.” “If you eat a high salt diet then the relationship between sodium and blood pressure is strong and lowering your sodium will result in larger reductions of blood pressure,” said Mente. “If you're eating an average sodium diet, lowering your sodium intake further would only have modest effects on blood pressure.” The studies also revealed that the effects of sodium on blood pressure can be most dramatic for the elderly, people with high blood pressure, those consuming more than 5,000 mg of sodium a day and those on a low-potassium diet. To stay healthy, Mente recommends that people not be complacent about their sodium intake, but also be mindful of other factors that contribute to their health like eating fruits and vegetables. “It's more important to focus on eating an overall healthy diet, exercising and not smoking,” they said. Countries with the highest average sodium intake per day Kazakhstan – 6,100 mg Uzbekistan – 5,700 mg Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Mauritius – 5,500 mg Kyrgyzstan, Georgia and Bahrain – 5,400 mg Republic of Korea – 5,300 mg --- Canada – 3,700 mg United States of America – 3,600 mg Global – 4,000 mg Source: Global Sodium Consumption and Cardiovascular Mortality (2010)
As FC Cincinnati finalizes its stadium plans for a possible promotion to Major League Soccer, the second-division United Soccer League club and its fans can breathe a little easier today.
MLS announced Wednesday that Cincinnati is one of four finalists for the two expansion clubs that are scheduled to be named by the end of the year, and FC Cincinnati received important confirmation the local government will support its efforts to build a soccer-specific stadium required for MLS.
»RELATED: FC Cincinnnati will finance stadium with private funds
FC Cincinnati's bid — one of 12 submitted in January as the initial application process began — was pushed through to the final stage of consideration along with Detroit, Nashville and Sacramento. Owners and officials representing the four prospective expansion markets will make formal presentations to MLS Commissioner Don Garber and the league's expansion committee in New York on Dec. 6, and a decision will be made following the Board of Governors meeting Dec. 14.
“The leaders of the Cincinnati, Detroit, Nashville and Sacramento MLS expansion ownership groups have bold visions and innovative plans for their clubs, stadiums and their involvement in their respective communities,” Garber said in a press release. “We are pleased these highly-respected business and sports leaders have been so determined to bring Major League Soccer to their cities. We have been greatly encouraged by the progress that all four of these groups have made and we are looking forward to their presentations.”

In the meantime, FC Cincinnati is still trying to nail down the last of the expansion requirements set forth by MLS, which prioritizes a soccer-specific stadium. The club originally pitched to MLS a stadium in Newport, but efforts to keep the team in Cincinnati, at a preferred site in Oakley, took a big step Wednesday with infrastructure funding plans passing a vote by the Hamilton County Board of Commissioners and City Council.
On Monday, City Council's Budget and Finance Committee agreed to spend up to $37 million for infrastructure at the Oakley site and a 5-3 vote by Council made it official Wednesday, shortly after Hamilton County Commissioners unanimously approved spending $15 million for a 1,000-space parking garage.
“It's time for this community now to come together — the city, count an FC (Cincinnati) — to demonstrate to MLS that we want a Major League Soccer franchise to be awarded to FC Cincinnati,” County Commissioner Todd Portune said in the meeting.
FC Cincinnati will be privately financing the $200 million stadium on the former Cast-Fab site but has asked the city and county for $75 million in infrastructure, which means there likely is still a $33 million gap in the funding even if the Council vote goes through.

After the commissioners voted, FC Cincinnati president and general manager Jeff Berding told WCPO.com the Oakley site is the one the club will pitch to MLS on Dec. 6. The club likely is competing with Nashville and Detroit for a spot in the Eastern Division with Sacramento expected to claim a spot in the Western Division.
The two teams chosen after the Dec. 14 board meeting will begin play in 2020, and two more expansion teams are scheduled to be selected at a later date to bring MLS to 28 teams. The other eight markets still in consideration for the final round of expansion are Charlotte, Indianapolis, Phoenix, Raleigh/Durham, St. Louis, San Antonio, San Diego and Tampa/St. Petersburg.
KOCHI: Goods and Services Tax GST ) has become the major factor that dampened the Onam sales in Kerala, considered as the harbinger of the festive season in the country that extends till Diwali.The impact has been not so much due to tax rates, which are almost the same as pre-GST level in most of the home appliances, but the consumers seem to be restrained in their spending, having exhausted their resources by June."The sales haven't taken off yet and so far we haven't seen the usual Onam rush. The consumers may have bought what they needed before July fearing an increase in the prices," said Ajmal Abdul Hameed, MD of Bismi Group, which runs one of the largest retail home appliances chains in the state.The consumer durables market in Kerala is calculated to be in the range of Rs 2000 to 3000 crore a year. Of this, about 50 to 60% of the sales happen during Onam festival extending to about two months. All the big branded players in the country make a strong pitch in the state with new launches and freebies to attract consumers."The sales are flat in the case of ACs and fridges. Early arrival of Onam and a cooler weather may have had an impact on the sales. TVs and washing machine sales are just ok," said Jerry Mathew, partner of White Mart retail chain.Gold jewellery sale is also witnessing a lacklustre trend. The season being auspicious for Hindu weddings, bulk purchases abound during Onam. " Such bulk purchases for weddings have been absent during this Onam. The rush of individuals coming to buy gold is there," said B Girirajan, MD of Bhima Jewellers, Kozhikode.Rise in the price of gold has not affected the sales much. " All the wedding purchases seem to have got over by June before GST came into being. Such buying accounts for nearly 50% of the total sales during wedding season time," Girirajan pointed out.Comparatively, apparels are doing better since people tend to buy new clothes during Onam. " The sales are just normal. We don't see a jump," said Pratap B Shah, owner of Shah & Co.Some of the dealers also have been slow in re-stocking post GST. " I think the effect of GST has been felt in the operational side. After heavy sales before GST some of the dealers have not re-stocked adequately for Onam sales particularly in big centres like Kochi. The peripheral towns are doing better in sales," said Alex K Babu, chief investment officer of Baby Marine Ventures Group, which owns large warehouses.But the trend of big Onam sales seems to be changing, perhaps due to the influence of the online sales market. " The consumer durable purchases are getting spread out throughout the year," said Chandrasekharan Pillai, chairperson of Dealers Digital Shoppe, an organisation of small dealers.

Detroit — It's been nearly 20 years since the iconic J. L. Hudson Co. department store imploded on Woodward, and it's been a blank slate ever since.
Fast forward to 2017, and Bedrock is preparing to break ground Dec. 1 on a $900 million mixed-use development that at 800 feet will be the tallest building in the city.
This 1-million-square-foot unnamed project will be on the site of the former department store, affectionately known as Hudson's.
Architecture and urban planning experts say it's time for the site to be developed. Some believe the building could become a new iconic symbol for downtown Detroit because of its design and centrality. But some believe having such a large-scale building downtown will draw activity away from other areas, such as New Center.
“It's long overdue that we have something on that site,” said Stephen Vogel, professor of architecture and former dean of the University of Detroit Mercy School of Architecture.
When built, the tallest point of the building will be higher than the 734-foot tower proposed earlier this year. It will exceed General Motors Co.'s Renaissance Center, which stands at 727 feet.
“It's a very tall building, which I think is appropriate for that site,” Vogel said. “Filling the site from edge to edge is appropriate.”
Detroit-based Hamilton Anderson Associates and New York City-based SHoP Architects are designing the proposed project.
The development will feature 425,000 square feet of residential space, 240,000 square feet of office space, 120,000 square feet of event space and 100,000 square feet of retail space. There will also be 700-plus underground parking spaces.
There will be two buildings with a pedestrian walkway in between. A residential tower will house 330 units. The recently announced increase to the building's height will provide better views over the nearby One Campus Martius building, say officials for Dan Gilbert's Bedrock.
Visually, the buildings incorporate a design with a glassy, open appearance.
“We worked really hard both visually to connect what's happening in the building to the street,” said Jamie Witherspoon, Bedrock's director of architecture. “Large glass expansions allow one to see in. What's happening in the building and vice versa.”
1950s-'60s heyday
In its heyday, Hudson's was the premier retailer in downtown Detroit and anchored the Woodward corridor. At 25 stories, the flagship store was once the tallest department store in the world. Shoppers flocked to see the Christmas displays and have their children sit on Santa's lap.
The store launched in 1891 when Joseph Lowthian Hudson opened a clothing store for men and boys in the old Detroit Opera House Building between Woodward and Monroe. In 1911, they built and opened a store on Farmer that would eventually undergo 12 expansions until it took over the entire block in 1946.
Hudson's reached the height of its success in the 1950s and 1960s and began to see a decline in business by the mid-1970s. The store closed in 1983. The building was imploded in 1998, leaving a vacant space in the heart of the city's downtown. The site sits above an underground parking structure.
Vogel said they were opposed to the city tearing down the Hudson's building and was part of a national firm's effort to redevelop the building.
“City was not interested,” Vogel said. “The reason the city was not interested is because the vacant Hudson building was a symbol of the failure of the city. The city wanted it down. So they tore it down.”
Charlie Beckham, who oversees the city's Department of Neighborhoods, was an appointee of former Mayor Dennis Archer when the Hudson's building came down.
“At the time, it was a vacant building,” said Beckham.
“The decision was made we could probably market that site better without a building than with a building,” they said. “That was really what happened. It became a better marketable site with that building down. It was just a hulk standing there. It was almost like the train station.”
Beckham said they expect good things under Gilbert's plan for the site.
“Dan Gilbert has got a pretty aggressive plan for that site,” said Beckham, who sits on the Downtown Development Authority board. “Dan Gilbert does pretty much everything they say he's going to do. So I got no reason to believe he's not going to do this.”
Gilbert's firms have had development rights to the property since 2007. Early conceptual designs were released in 2015 and more detailed plans earlier this year. In September, Bedrock released new renderings that brought with the project a higher price tag, taller tower and a longer construction timeline beyond the anticipated 2020 opening.
Because of the department store's history as a hub of shopping and social activity, it's important to incorporate access for the public in the design, said Kimberly Dowdell, a Detroit-based architect, real estate developer and lecturer in architecture at the University of Michigan.

“The development needs to feel welcoming, not just to new Detroiters, but to longtime residents who have seen Detroit in best of days and worse of days,” Dowdell said. “If everyone feels it's a welcoming and inviting place to be then I think it would be a successful project.”
Developers say one of the purposes for the project is to draw in the public with retail along Woodward, an open-air Farmer Street market during warmer months and spaces such as the pedestrian walk and the observation deck. One does not have to be a tenant or employee in the building to experience it, Witherspoon said.
“Everyone you talk to has some sort of connection to the Hudson's site,” they said. “It lives in the collective memories of Detroiters. Everyone remembers an experience there, remembers when the building came down. I think that history and the role the building played in the history of the city is not lost on us.”
Carolyn Loh, associate professor of urban studies and planning at Wayne State University, said they believe the public space on the ground floor and the observation deck will be welcoming for everyone.
“So many downtowns are becoming sites of extreme luxury, and partly because of our economic woes and, partly, I like to think, because of our Midwestern ethos, we've avoided that so far in Detroit,” they said. “It's definitely exciting to see new development anywhere in the city, but especially because of the centrality of the Hudson's site I think it's important that it be an inclusive space — there are ways to signal inclusiveness with the architecture, the signage, that kind of thing, that I hope they will take advantage of.”
Loh said that they would like to see this project, in particular, set aside space for affordable housing.
“This is a symbolically important building, and making it so, at least some middle- and lower-income people could participate is part of what I mean about an inclusive space,” they said.
Whitney Eichinger, spokesperson for Bedrock, said the company is still determining the number of affordable units it will have in each of its developments, but there will be at least five units in the Hudson's project.
There could be a downside to such a large project, said Rayman Mohamed, associate professor and interim chair of urban studies and planning for Wayne State University.
“I am concerned that this single, large building might suck the energy out of other neighborhoods,” they said. “We still have large underutilized buildings in the city, including the Albert Kahn building and the Fisher building.”
The Albert Kahn building was at 20 percent capacity when developers, the Platform, listed it for sale in September. The building was not marketed for tenancy in anticipation of a renovation, building officials said.
But developers with the Platform don't seem to view the new development as a threat.
“As one of Detroit's most iconic office buildings, we are confident that the Fisher Building will remain competitive with other Class-A buildings in the downtown market,” said Dan Austin, a spokesperson for the Platform. “We also believe that new-construction, multi-tenant office space in our market will be a great sign of the continuing resurgence of Detroit.”

‘A missing tooth'
In September, Gilbert unveiled a $2.1 billion plan that packaged the Hudson's site project with three other developments to be considered as one for a new state tax incentive.
The others are the $830 million overhaul of the Monroe Blocks between Greektown and Campus Martius; the $313 million renovation of the Book Building and Tower on Washington; and a $95 million addition to the One Campus Martius building. Gilbert has said that the projects will rely on $250 million — about 12 percent of the overall investment — from the new Michigan Thrive legislation that they heavily lobbied Lansing politicians to pass.
About 11 percent of the total project cost for the Hudson's site will be covered by the Michigan Thrive initiative, Eichinger said.
The downtown is due for another high-rise building, said Carl Roehling, a principal at SmithGroupJJR and board member of the Michigan Architecture Foundation. They note that with the exception of the 1920s, Detroit has had a pattern of seeing one high rise built every decade. The most recent was the 344-foot-tall Greektown Casino Hotel completed in 2009 at 555 E. Lafayette. Prior to that, the 619-foot-tall One Detroit Center, now known as the Ally Detroit Center, was completed in 1993 at 500 Woodward.
“The new one being proposed I think is phenomenal,” they said. “The site itself has been a missing tooth in an urban fabric.”
Being the tallest building in Detroit wasn't the first goal of the project, Witherspoon said.
“There are these buildings that signify the cities that they're a part of,” Witherspoon said. “We wanted that building to have that, be an important icon whether it's the tallest was part of that, but not the driving factor in that.”
‘An economic engine'
Dowdell said they believe the available space in the building will attract companies not already located downtown.
“Most notable, it will attract companies from other locations,” they said. “Other cities. Other states as well. It can be an economic engine.”
Bedrock is still making decisions regarding tenants, officials said.
By December, passersby of the Hudson's site will see barricades go up and construction crews begin work to remove the existing underground parking garage.
Designers will continue to work on the finer details of the project, Witherspoon said, such as wall colors and door selections for an open market.
Roehling said he'll be glad to see the steel beams removed from the site. In warm weather, they walk down Woodward two or three times a week. They said they miss the presence of the Hudson's building when they take their grandchildren to the Thanksgiving Day Parade along Woodward each year.
“It irritates me that there's nothing there,” they said. “It's thought of as the heart of the parade. It's something that needs to be filled in for sure.”

Summary: Five sceptical charts on the stifling effects of EU regulation
When asked to name a potential upside to leaving the EU, many British business leaders point to the cost of EU regulation. Critics of the EU also argue that 'social Europe' – the EU's attempt to impose minimum standards on working conditions – has imposed unnecessary burdens on British employers, and that the European Commission's impact assessments are biased in favour of proposed rules. For some eurosceptics, the costs of red tape emanating from Brussels outweigh the benefits of membership of the single market. Are they right?
There can be no doubt that some EU rules impose more costs than benefits. But two conditions must be satisfied to demonstrate that Brexit would lead to better regulation and improved economic performance. First, that the aggregate costs of EU regulations re larger than the benefits, and second, that Britain would not impose such regulations if it left the EU.
Rules at the EU level are designed to create common standards in order to make products more tradable: a lawnmower made in the UK can be sold in Germany without having to be manufactured according to German specifications, for example. Chart 1 shows the overall level of product market regulation for the UK, the EU-15, the newer EU states, and the rest of the OECD. EU rules do not appear to impose rigid harmonisation on the union as a whole: under EU directives, member-states are able to impose higher standards on their own firms if they wish, and over time, the level of regulation in other member-states has converged on Britain's liberal approach, rather than the other way round. It is hard to argue that Britain's product and services markets are highly regulated as a result of EU membership.
A broadly similar story emerges over the EU's regulation of labour markets. The OECD's indicators of labour market protection – rules that make it harder to dismiss workers – also show a wide dispersion across the Union (Chart 2). Britain's EU membership has not prevented it from having one of the most flexible labour markets in the world, which is one reason why unemployment remained relatively low in the recession following the 2008 financial crisis. The OECD data show that British workers have a low level of protection that is more similar to Anglophone countries than to other EU member-states.
Nonetheless, the EU has attempted to regulate working conditions. Two totemic EU directives, which regulate working time and agency workers, have particularly antagonised British conservatives. A respectable case can be made that such EU rules violate the principle of subsidiarity – there is little evidence that working conditions have been eroded as the result of competition between member-states, which might justify action at the European level. But the two directives have had surprisingly little impact on the British labour market. British workers are able to opt out of the Working Time Directive and work more than the mandated 48 hours per week if they wish. As Chart 3 shows, at most, 1.5 per cent of workers – those working 48 hours a week – might be constrained from working longer hours. It follows that if Britain left the EU and abolished working time rules, the resulting boost to hours worked and national income would be modest.
The other bugbear, the Agency Workers Directive, has also had a surprisingly modest impact. The rules, which came into force in 2011, give employment agency workers the right to the same pay, holidays and working conditions as equivalent permanent workers once they have worked for the same company for 12 weeks. Before it came into force, businesses and the Conservative leadership warned that it would make companies less willing to take on agency temps. But Chart 4 shows that agency employment continued to climb after the rules came into force. By 2014, the proportion of temporary workers who found work through an agency had grown from 19 to 20 per cent: the regulations did not lead employers to switch from agency temps to other temporary workers. The chart also shows that businesses continued to make use of a loophole that allows an exemption from the right to equal pay if workers are formally employed by the agency, not the company they are working for. Two-thirds of agency workers were employed by agencies, not employers. The largest potential cost of the regulations – equal pay – therefore only applies to a minority of agency temps.
All this suggests that the most valid criticism one can make of the Working Time and Agency Workers directives is that, thanks to opt outs and loopholes, they fail to meet their stated objectives.
Alongside its labour and product market indices, the OECD has compiled an index of the quality of countries' regulatory regimes (Chart 5). Open Europe, a think-tank close to the Conservative party, has argued that after conducting impact assessments, the EU fails to drop many of its proposed laws, and that the quality of the assessments are poor. But the OECD tested the European Commission's rule-making process alongside other countries, and found that it is of better quality than the OECD average – and similar to that of UK and Australia, which the OECD ranks highest. There can be little doubt that some proposals are forced through the EU's legislative machinery without proper assessment of the potential costs, but it is far from clear, on the basis of the OECD's index at least, that the EU does this more than the UK itself.
It appears, then, that Britain would not be able to engineer a boost to growth and employment by abolishing EU rules. And this is all the more apparent when one considers the trade-off at the heart of the Brexit question: that, in order to maintain access to the EU's single market, the UK would have to sign up to the relevant EU laws. A single market differs from a free trade agreement because it seeks to tackle barriers to trade that arise from diverse national regulations. And, as a result, the European Commission has insisted that Turkey, Norway and Switzerland, which have different degrees of single market access, sign up to the relevant parts of the acquis communitaire. A post-Brexit bonfire of EU rules would hardly be enough to warm a pot of tea.

When former PM Tony Blair first appeared before the Iraq inquiry five years ago to give evidence, the chairperson Sir John Chilcot (pictured) treated them with an almost painful deference
When Tony Blair first appeared before the Iraq inquiry five years ago, the chairperson Sir John Chilcot treated them with almost painful deference.
Chilcot, a crumpled figure whose opening remarks lasted seven minutes, never laid a glove on Blair, even though the former prime minister gave evidence for more than six hours.
What few people know is that the bumbling Chilcot, a retired career civil servant, could, in fact, have greeted Blair as an old friend.
The first time they met in 1997 — when Blair was still leader of the Opposition — was in a far more sedate environment. They dined together in the venerable Travellers Club in Pall Mall, where Chilcot is a member.
The meeting was so discreet it would have remained a secret but for a single sentence in a 2008 book by Blair's former Chief of Staff, Jonathan Powell, called Great Hatred, Little Room, Making Peace In Northern Ireland.
At the time of the meeting, John Chilcot was the most senior civil servant at the Northern Ireland Office.
They had agreed to the clandestine encounter with Blair almost five months before the Labour leader became prime minister.
Civil servants often meet Opposition politicians for briefings in the run-up to elections, but they are usually held in Whitehall departments, where minutes are taken.
Yet Chilcot had agreed to meet Blair in the club, which was founded in 1819 for ‘gentlemen who travelled abroad', thereby ensuring it was not made public.
After Blair became prime minister, they worked closely with Chilcot on the Northern Ireland peace process, until the mandarin took early retirement at the end of 1997.
Chilcot was then knighted by a grateful Blair into the Order of the Bath, the fourth most senior order of British chivalry.
But even after they retired from the Civil Service, Chilcot never really left the corridors of power — they have now worked in Whitehall for 50 years — taking on a series of roles on any number of public committees, often at the behest of the Blair administration.
When Lord Butler was asked to set up an inquiry in 2004 into the role of the intelligence services in the Iraq war, Blair chose the members of the inquiry's five-strong committee.
During the inquiry Chilcot never laid a glove on Blair even though the former PM gave evidence for six hours
Surprise, surprise, Chilcot was one of the first people asked to serve on it by the Labour prime minister.
When it reported, the Butler inquiry was widely derided. Though it provided devastating evidence that Downing Street, with the collusion of intelligence chiefs, ‘sexed up' the threat to the British people from Saddam Hussein before going to war, it concluded that no one should be held responsible.
In short, it let Blair off the hook.
In 2009, when Gordon Brown appointed Chilcot to lead their own wide-ranging inquiry into the war, military leaders as well as senior lawyers and politicians were furious that it was to be held behind closed doors.
Major General Julian Thompson, who was highly decorated for their command of the Royal Marines in the Falklands, warned: ‘A report from a secret inquiry will look like a whitewash.'
The Tories forced — and lost — a Commons vote on who should make up the inquiry team, complaining they were ageing patsies who were not up to the job.
Political pressure did, however, mean the inquiry was not held in secret.
There was genuine scepticism that Chilcot, a former civil servant who had spent their entire working life immersed in the machinery of government, had the temperament to ask the forensic questions necessary to unravel an Establishment cover-up over the war.

Philippe Sands, QC, who works at Matrix Chambers, the human rights firm set up by Cherie Blair, was one of the first to call into question the choice of Chilcot.
Now professor of international law at University College, London, Mr Sands said: ‘It is not immediately apparent that they will have the backbone to take on former government ministers.
‘What was it about their role in the Butler inquiry that caused the prime minister to conclude they were suitable? Some who have worked closely with him, including on the Butler inquiry, fear they are not the right person.
‘Someone who has seen them first-hand described their approach as one of “obvious deference to governmental authority”. This is a view I have heard repeated several times. More troubling is evidence I have seen for myself.'
Sands was not impressed by Chilcot's questioning at the Butler inquiry of Lord Goldsmith, who was Attorney General at the time of the Iraq war and who, under pressure, had changed their original judgment that the war was illegal.
They said: ‘Sir John's spoon-fed questions give every impression of being designed to elicit a response from the Attorney General that would demonstrate the reasonableness of their actions and those of the government.'
When it came to Chilcot's own inquiry, held in a small cramped room in a grey conference centre in Westminster, there have been similar shortcomings — quite apart from the disgracefully protracted nature of the proceedings.
According to former senior BBC journalist Rod Liddle, when former Washington ambassador Sir Christopher Meyer was before the panel they became utterly bored with ‘charming, learned and polite knighted people asking the gentlest of questions'.
Then there was the moment in 2011 — two years after the inquiry had begun — when John Chilcot turned up in the audience at the premiere of a play about the build-up to the Iraq war.
It was written by Sarah Helm, whose partner is Jonathan Powell, the most important official in the Downing Street ‘kitchen Cabinet' during the war.

In one scene, the actor playing Blair had a conversation with Sir Richard Dearlove, the then head of MI6, about intelligence issues relating to the war.
Despite having interrogated Blair and Dearlove, Chilcot had never unearthed the existence of this particular conversation.
After seeing the play, they demanded more files from Whitehall, which confirmed it really had taken place.
In truth, the play seems to have shed more light on the reasons Britain went to war than Chilcot's blustering.
They are, it is fair to say, a rather dry old stick.
Born in 1939, they were privately educated at £31,000-a-year Brighton College and then Pembroke College, Cambridge, where they studied English and modern and medieval languages.
An avid reader, they claim to love learning new words and once said they would take The Oxford English Dictionary in 12 volumes as their reading matter to a desert island.
They married their wife Rosemary, an artist, in 1964, and they have no children.
The couple used to live in a £1.3 million farm in Haslemere, Surrey, but now divide their time between a £500,000 property in Somerset and a two-bedroom flat in Westminster bought without a mortgage in 2012 as the Chilcot inquiry was beginning to drag on.
After spells in a variety of posts in the Home Office and the Cabinet Office, they ended up at the Northern Ireland Office at the start of the peace process.
Even though Tory Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke had opened a confidential dialogue with the IRA and Sinn Fein, Chilcot, a key figure in the talks, authorised a statement describing allegations in the media of negotiations with the IRA as a ‘fantasy'.
Flames: A British soldier leaping from their armoured vehicle after it came under attack in Basra, Iraq, in 2005
When a Sunday newspaper produced detailed evidence that the talks were at an advanced stage, they telephoned the editor to try to persuade them to put a ‘gloss' on the news.
Once asked what was their proudest achievement, Chilcot said: ‘Northern Ireland. Helping the transition from war to peace.'
After they left Belfast, Chilcot moved seamlessly into a series of government-appointed posts, chairing inquiries into the voting system and royal security, as well as into an IRA raid.
Last week, it was reported they have been known to spend only seven or eight hours a week in their Westminster office on the Iraq inquiry. If true, it's little wonder.
A fully paid-up member of the Establishment, they also find time to chair the Advisory Committee of the Centre for Contemporary British History, they are a member of the Institute of Historical Research Advisory Council and is President of the Police Foundation, an independent think-tank.
He's chairperson of the Building and Civil Engineering Group and a member of the National Archives Council.
One Tory MP said: ‘He is serving on endless well-meaning committees and public bodies. So when do they have the time to do the Iraq work?'
With the costs of the inquiry soaring to £10 million plus, and Chilcot and their three fellow panel members earning a reputed £1.5 million from it, this lifelong mandarin has acquired a new nickname among civil servants.
The codename for the initial British and American bombing raids on Iraq back in 2003 was ‘Shock And Awe'; they have dubbed Chilcot ‘block and bore'.
To be fair, Sir Christopher Meyer says Sir John Chilcot is a victim of the limited power of the inquiry's terms of reference.
‘When Downing Street set up the inquiry into phone-hacking at newspapers it was a judicial inquiry led by a judge, Lord Justice Leveson,' they said.
‘The Leveson inquiry had powers to compel witnesses to appear and to answer all questions put to them. Chilcot does not have that power. A judge should be running this inquiry, not a retired civil servant.'
Few of Chilcot's former colleagues in Whitehall expect them to rock the boat when the report eventually comes out. ‘He is a safe pair of hands who is close to some of the key players in the inquiry. It's why they got the job,' says another diplomat.
‘He's also 76 — not exactly a spring chicken — and is clearly slowing down.'
Chilcot, a private figure who eschews publicity, gave a rare interview in 2011 to The Old Brightonians, the magazine of their former school.
Asked the most challenging parts of the job, they replied: ‘Keeping steady judgment when sailing through troubled waters.'
They were also pressed on what was the best advice they had ever been given. They replied: ‘Try your best at things you're not good at.'
Texan Wesley Spurlock finds themselves walking the fine line that divides corn and cattle. Yet, with feet firmly planted in both, they see more reason to come together than to argue across the fence that often divides the two.
Spurlock's diversified crop and cattle operation will see them open a 3,000-head backgrounding yard in 2017. He'll also lead the huge National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) as its incoming president.
Talk about being in agriculture.
Spurlock is determined to make their beef program work at the same time they carry their leadership skills and commodity association experience to head the nation's largest grain organization. He'll work to balance their cattle and crop production and maximize their margins, as well as balance and promote farm policy that will benefit corn and cattle in the long run.
Their family runs Spurlock Farms Too in the northern Texas Panhandle outside Stratford. The multigenerational operation includes roughly 16,000 acres of corn, cotton, sorghum, milo and alfalfa. They ran stocker cattle on wheat pasture and cornstalks until three years of drought virtually eliminated their grazing. Drought also slapped their row-crop production, as irrigation water was stretched so much that some corn saw huge yield reductions.
“Because of the drought, in 2012 we started to grow more cotton, which requires less water than corn, and we reduced our production of wheat and sorghum. That affected our ability to raise cattle in the winter,” Spurlock tells BEEF. “Last year, we bought a starter feeder beef operation with capacity to raise 3,000 head, and we are preparing to start producing cattle in 2017.”
In their “spare” time, he'll perform a chore they love nearly as much as farming and cattle — working to make life better for farmers as NCGA president. That includes working to obtain good farm policy and develop better markets for corn and corn byproducts. He'll also lead NCGA's efforts to prevent federal regulatory agencies from writing rules that infringe on producer property rights, and dictate how farmers, ranchers and feeders must run their operations.
“I first got involved at the state level with the Corn Producers Association of Texas in 2002,” they say. “I was interested in corn production and sustainability issues, and served on NCGA action teams that addressed them. I enjoyed the work and continued to develop my knowledge of the industry and my organizational skills.”
NCGA leaders convinced them they had both the time and skills to make an effective contribution to the organization. Among their duties as president is to promote ethanol as a fuel additive to gasoline, which is required in many metro areas under the federal Clean Air Act.
And, as a beef producer and member of the Texas Cattle Feeders Association, they realize there has been friction at times in the beef industry over how some ethanol processors received a subsidy for their production, something that was not provided to livestock feeders.
Walking the line
“Corn growers, like cattlemen, are always seeking additional markets,” Spurlock says, adding that more corn production was needed to meet demands for more protein worldwide, as well as renewable fuels.
“The ethanol industry required a stable supply of feedstock. Entering our domestic fuel market with an energy source provided corn farmers like myself with a tremendous growth opportunity. Improved technology and best management practices made it possible to expand our production," they say.
Spurlock points out that for more than a decade, the ethanol industry has provided a valuable co-product, dried distillers grains (DDGs), which has become a valuable feed additive for the livestock industry. That was interrupted by drought across the Corn Belt that wrecked corn production for several years. It caused short supplies of corn and other feed grains for livestock and ethanol markets.
“The livestock industry saw similar drought-related impacts, as ranchers were forced to cull herds,” they say. “The corn industry was sympathetic to the plight of cattlemen, since many of us also have livestock operations.”
Alliance is needed
They realize there may always be some disagreement among farmers and livestock producers. “But we are together on more issues than we are apart,” Spurlock explains. “NCGA stands with cattlemen on protecting production agriculture, opening and expanding markets for corn-fed U.S. beef, and promoting our shared way of life.
“Our futures are intertwined, and it's imperative that we don't let one issue or outside groups divide and conquer us. American agriculture and food production are the envy of the world, yet attacks on our food system and modern production practices are occurring at an increasing rate.
“These attacks are even more threatening when you consider that farm and ranch families comprise just 2% of the U.S. population. To address these assaults, corn growers partner with a number of agricultural advocacy groups — including livestock — to defend against irrational detractors and educate confused consumers.”
They stress that their livelihood is dependent on the health of both sectors. “There are very few issues facing U.S. agriculture that don't impact both the grain and livestock industries in equal fashion,” Spurlock says. “We're in this together.
“We face bigger and more complex problems than we've dealt with in the past. We've also benefited from each other's growth and accomplishments. New and larger markets for beef mean a rise in the need for corn feed.”
Spurlock says the mutual reliance between corn farmers and livestock producers “has put us in the same camp when working to ensure U.S. agriculture is treated fairly on a number of regulatory issues.”
For instance, in Washington, D.C., both industries have sought solutions that simultaneously protect the environment without penalizing production agriculture. “For example, we have joined animal agriculture to file suit against overreaching regulations like the Chesapeake Bay TMDL [total maximum daily loads] and Waters of the United States [WOTUS].
“Working together helps magnify our voice to achieve our collective goals. I can't emphasize it enough. We are much stronger if we find forums where we can work together for common causes.”
They note that corn growers and cattle producers both have good organizations that work together with other agricultural advocacy groups at both state and national levels.
“We have seen how working with the U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance [USFRA] is helpful in defending against our detractors and educating consumers,” they say. “That's the power of working together with a group of nearly 100 farmer- and rancher-led like-minded organizations.”
Spurlock also suggests a grassroots group of farm women, CommonGround, as a way crop and livestock producers can educate consumers. “This program was developed by NCGA and the United Soybean Board and connects farm women with their urban counterparts to engage in conversations about plant and animal production,” they say. “These conversations benefit us all.”
Meanwhile, back at the farm
Spurlock is eager to see how their new backgrounding and feeding venture pans out this year. He'll keep working to balance their crop and cattle production.
They hope that cattle and corn prices improve, and that winter brings good moisture for their crop ground and pastures. And when their backgrounding yard is stocked, he'll look at feeding some of their crops in the ration.
“We expect to use some of our hay, silage and corn in the feeding operation,” they say. “Just how much is hard to tell. Depending on commodity markets and the weather, come back and ask us next year when we're up and running. We'll let you know then.”
The problem with providing for an ageing population is not the money, it is the real goods and services, writes Dr Steven Hail.
AUSTRALIA'S TAX-ADVANTAGED, compulsory, private superannuation system – the jewel in the crown of the legacy of the Hawke/Keating era – is an innocent fraud.
The system was introduced with the best of intentions, but it doesn't do what it was supposed to do.
In fact, in more ways than one, it makes social provisioning for retirees harder than it otherwise would have been. It certainly doesn't help pay for the cost of an ageing population. That is the sense in which the system is fraudulent and the reason some people think it ought to be scrapped.
That might seem a shocking thing for me to have written. Imagine if Paul Keating themselves was to read this article? I had better justify myself.
What was the purpose of our super system when it was first introduced in 1993? Obvious, you might say — to ensure that as many people as possible would be able, across their working lives, to build up their personal savings and investments sufficiently to become self-supporting in retirement. This, we were told, would reduce the burden on taxpayers of the state aged pension, given the gradual but inevitable ageing of Australia's population.
This all seems very reasonable, and through a neoliberal frame it makes perfect sense, but neoliberalism is based on a flawed and misleading model of the economy.
It is true that Australia's population is ageing. It is true that the proportion of the population in retirement will increase in future decades, even if people do retire, on average, at a greater age than before. It is not true that tax-advantaged super will do anything at all to help with the cost of providing for the increasing proportion of retirees in the decades to come. If anything, the opposite will be the case.
Let's switch from a neoliberal perspective, where the government is seen as a household which has to balance its books over time, to a Modern Monetary Theory (MMT, also sometimes called "functional finance") frame, where balanced budgets are rare and often destructive.
MMT, which is largely just a description of how the monetary system works, tells us that the Australian Commonwealth Government, as a currency issuing government with a floating exchange rate and a modern financial system, cannot run out of Australian dollars.
However, it also tells us – if this was not already obvious – that Australia as a country can run out of labour, skills, equipment, infrastructural, technological, natural and ecological resources.
The government can and will run budget deficits almost all the time indefinitely into the future, as it has done in the past. It is because the government runs deficits that the rest of us can run surpluses. If the Australian private sector and the rest of the world are to save in Australian dollars, the Australian Government has to spend those dollars. The government cannot run out of its own currency and is not dependent on anyone else to lend it the currency — of which it is the issuer.
So we can lay one fear to rest. The Government will not and cannot be bankrupted by the financial cost of providing a state pension to the elderly. The government cannot become insolvent in its own currency at all. This is impossible. Neither is the government obliged to balance its books. In fact, on average over time, it must run a deficit, if the rest of us are to run surpluses.
The problem with providing for an ageing population will not be – and can never be – a shortage of Australian dollars.
The problem will be providing sufficient goods and services for that ageing population to consume, without going beyond the productive capacity of the economy and causing inflation, ecological collapse and/or both.
Money is not the problem. It really isn't.
In theory, the Hawke/Keating and Howard/Costello private superannuation system might still have been helpful if it had directed savings towards funding investments, which caused productivity growth and encouraged a more rapid transition to ecological sustainability. However, there is no evidence at all that the first of these has been the case and to suggest the second is true is laughable. Private super might be nice for you or me to have if we are among the "haves" rather than the "have-nots", but it has done precisely nothing to add to social provisioning for the aged. Nothing at all.
Indeed, it may have made matters worse.
In so far as tax-advantaged super has allowed some people to build up more paper wealth in retirement than they might otherwise have had, it will allow those people to spend more in retirement than they might have otherwise done. If we do find ourselves, as a nation, up against a real resource constraint in the future, then far from private super reducing the tax burden, this will increase it.
The purpose of taxation is not to pay for government spending but to keep total spending (private and public) below the capacity of the economy. Taxes are there to limit inflation. So it is possible that tax-advantaged private superannuation, by adding nothing to the productive capacity of the economy but adding to private spending power, might force future governments to tax more highly, to limit spending to what can be produced. The opposite of what was intended.
Perhaps a greater problem with our super system is that it has played a significant role in the growing financialisation of our economy. Research done by psychologists like George Loewenstein and anthropologists like David Graeber suggests that our attitudes to others depend crucially on how inter-personal relations are framed. If we are encouraged to view those relationships as financial and competitive and encouraged to see others as being separate from and different to ourselves, the majority of us tend to welcome advantageous inequality. If on the other hand, we are encouraged to take a communal view, where "we are all in this together" and inter-personal relationships are not financialised, then the majority of us dislike inequality — even when it is in our favour.
What a shift from state pensions for the elderly to a private superannuation system does is to shift social attitudes towards future inequality in retirement in a way which I find concerning, and which I am sure was not part of the vision held by Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, for future generations. That's why I called it an innocent fraud. They misunderstood the constraints faced by governments with modern monetary systems. They ignored the real constraints we as a country are faced with – and these continue to be ignored – and they tried to deal with an imaginary, or at best, self-imposed fiscal constraint, which it is important to understand makes no sense at all.
What can we do?
Scrap tax concessions on retirement savings. End compulsory private superannuation. Meantime, require employers to start paying out the 9.5 per cent that is currently going into super as wages and salaries, and tax it as such.
Introduce a job guarantee scheme for those of working age and pay those of retirement age the job guarantee wage.
Conduct a national audit of the skills and the infrastructure that Australia will require in the decades to come to provide for its ageing population, and put in place the plans needed to ensure those skills and that infrastructure exists when it is needed.
Because the problem is not the money — it is the real goods and services, as it always was.

Bringing Māori history and culture alive to screens is The Dead Lands [update: this is currently undated – stay tuned for when Dead Lands will arrive in cinemas], a period-set action-adventure based on the traditional fighting art of Mau rākau. After their tribe is slaughtered through an act of treachery, the chieftan's teenage son Hongi (James Rolleston, Boy) must avenge their father's death in order to bring honor to the souls of their loved ones. Outnumbered by the band of villains, Hongi's only hope is to pass through the forbidden Dead Lands and forge an alliance with the mysterious “Warrior” (Lawrence Makoare, Die Another Day). From Toa Fraser, director of No. 2 and Dean Spanley, and co-starring Rena Owen (Once Were Warriors) and former NRL player Wairangi Koopu.
The still above shows Hongi (right) fighting Rangi (Xavier Horan, Dean Spanley) and Wirepa (Te Kohe Tuhaka, Sione's 2: Unfinished Business), demonstrating a mere tingle of a taste of what's to come. If that doesn't excite you enough, this chat we had with producer Matthew Metcalfe below surely will. They give us even more details about the production, as well as how they got the interest of “those dudes who made The Raid”.
FLICKS: Let's start with the concept of a Māori action film. I'm wondering why we haven't had this sooner…
MATTHEW METCALFE: As a producer, one of the things that I always look for is what I call the ‘why didn't I think of that?' moment. I had the opposite of that too, like, ‘surely this has been done before, it's such a good idea'. And then you start to realise it hasn't, giving it this ‘Yeah, we gotta do this' factor.
I was perhaps more nervous of it than I should have been. I felt like this was an amazing idea, it was unique and it was gonna travel, whereas traditionally if you're doing a film in te reo, or a foreign language, that was perceived as kind of hindering you. But because we're doing an action film, I think it really helps us. Like The Raid, we're the cool foreign language action film that America didn't make, and that's what I really like about it.
I also love the fact that this film could not be made anywhere in the world but in New Zealand, and it's never been made before. This is like Game of Thrones Māori-style.
Why didn't you call it that – ‘Game of Thrones Māori-styles'?
Now I think of it, it is, it's like The Raid or Apocalypto. This is Māori before Europeans came; this is Māori when it was an empire in New Zealand. It's like, feudal Māori; Samurai Māori; Māori when there was this feudal society, tribe against tribe and people against people, and it was about honour, about how your ancestors thought of you and about fighting to the death. It's cool.
We're quite happy to call this the Māori version of ‘The Raid', but it's not a bad analogy considering that XYZ Films – production company behind ‘The Raid' – picked it up just from the script alone.
What's really exciting about XYZ is that they're fans. Often when you share footage with Hollywood executives, it can be very… not fun. But XYZ understand the process from ‘go' to ‘whoa', so they're like, ‘cool, cool, cool, yeah, awesome!' and all you've given them is just a raw take, not even cut together. Kudos to them, they're really good at taking raw material and getting what will happen when you cut it together – sound, music, shorten the length, whatever you're gonna do to it. They were into it right from the get go and they've been into it ever since.
And thanks to them, the film has been sold to Wild Side as well, who previously acquired the likes of Park Chan-wook's ‘Oldboy'.
We're really excited to work with Wild Side for France, and Transmission for Australia and New Zealand. These are distributors with great taste, and they know how to get the film to audiences. So, we're jazzed.
I imagine it'd be quite invigorating as well, on set, to know that such people are behind this film.
It's invigorating and scary! It's cool but you feel a lot of pressure on a film like this, cos you know what the expectations are. What I want, and I know what Toa wants, is for New Zealand audiences to see this film. 16 to 24-year-old males is kinda the target audience. I just want them to go, ‘cooool'. And I want 16-year-olds to come home and get their broom sticks and start giving each other a good whack, like I would have done. When I was 16 I would have pulled a broomstick off, got my mate, and gone, ‘yeah let's do these moves'. What you get to see in this film is something I've never seen before which is the taiaha and the patu in action. Designed as weapons of war and being used as weapons of war.
You're really focused every day on: Are we doing this right? Are we telling this epic, feudal Samurai, Kurosawa kind of story? Are the performances great? Are the action sequences great? And are we true to New Zealand? In all of this, you've gotta respect Māori. Are we respecting that this is a Māori world, and are we respecting the mana of that story? That's really important. Every day we have a karakia [prayer]. Every time we go to a new location the tribal elders come onboard and bless it. It's really important that we imbue the film with a sense of ‘this is the Māori world'.
STMX is a high-performance implementation of composable Transactional Memory (TM) for Common Lisp. TM is a concurrency control mechanism aimed at making concurrent programming easier to write and understand. Instead of traditional lock-based programming, one programs with atomic memory transactions, which can be composed together to make larger atomic memory transactions.
A memory transaction gets committed if it returns normally, while it gets rolled back if it signals an error (and the error is propagated to the caller).
Finally, memory transactions can safely run in parallel in different threads, are re-executed from the beginning in case of conflicts or if consistent reads cannot be guaranteed, and effects of a memory transaction are not visible from other threads until it commits.
Memory transactions give freedom from deadlocks, automatic roll-back on failure, and aim at resolving the tension between granularity and concurrency.
General documentation
An introduction is available to explain more in detail what STMX is, what it is not, and how it is implemented. For the complete docs, see the Documentation page.
For background information, Composable Memory Transactions is a very good – though a bit technical – explanation of memory transactions and how they are used and combined. For the interested reader, it also goes in deep detail on how to actually implement them.

The article title comes from a Dwayne McDuffie quote, and with any luck, you've already read or heard something this week about him. The writer/producer/editor whose work spanned almost every channel of geek expression, from comics to TV to animated films, would have been 55 years old this week had they not passed away six years ago today of complications from emergency heart surgery. Dwayne made everything they did better for their involvement, and it's in that spirit that we wanted to throw a little extra spotlight on not only some of the projects they worked on, but the man himself.
(This is NOT an exhaustive list by any stretch of the imagination. But it's our hope that in checking out the comics, animation, and interviews below, you'll find some work of McDuffie's that might have flown under your radar before now.)
COMMENTARY
It's one thing to say that McDuffie was a brilliant guy or a funny guy or a guy who really knew their stuff. But it's another to see it for yourself. If there's any doubt about their geek cred, then these blog posts should lay them to rest.
This next one requires a little explanation:
McDuffie wrote “Justice League of America” from 2007 to 2009. That run (#13-33) has been collected in several trade paperbacks and should be one of the books listed below. But I can't bring myself to put them on there, not only because of story quality, but the later revelations that they had to jump through an inordinate amount of editorial hoops to even get what they got out there (not an unheard of situation in mainstream superhero comics) and their later firing from the title for answering fan questions about their run honestly on DC message boards. I'm not saying DC didn't have a right to remove them for whatever reason, but to have someone of Dwayne's obvious caliber and affinity for the League (he was one of the story editors and producers for the Timmverse Justice League series) on the title, and NOT give them as much leeway as possible, or a capable artist, seems incredibly cruel and disrespectful. But if you want to see a writer talk honestly about trying to do a good job under fire, then you will want to check this out. (Warning: massive amounts of popup ads; McDuffie content is about 2/3rds of the way down the page.
When it comes to hearing the man himself, there isn't very much of them available on YouTube, but here are a few of my favorite bits that show just some of what they brought to their work:
MILESTONE AND ICON
For a whole swath of comics readers, the first thing Dwayne is known for is their contributions to Milestone Comics, the mid-'90s DC imprint that focused on superheroes from a setting (Dakota) specifically designed to represent the world outside our windows more truthfully than Metropolis or Gotham ever had. While often dismissed as “black comics,” Milestone was smartly inclusive and multiracial, and one of the few highlights of that decade in corporate comics. McDuffie was not only a co-founder of the imprint, but also its Editor-in-Chief and primary writers.
While DC has been threatening to bring the Milestone/Dakota universe back to life in Rebirth, nothing has yet materialized. So the best way to check out the Milestone aesthetic and McDuffie's work in particular is with the “Icon: A Hero's Welcome”. Collecting the first 8 issues of the “Icon” series, this story handles the introduction of Dakota's Superman surrogate by combining their story with that of Raquel, a young black teen who acts as much as their conscience as their ‘pal' (to borrow Jimmy Olsen's title). The strength of McDuffie's work here is in its combination of “Super” genre tropes with strong and honest characterizations putting those tropes through their paces.

Plus? Mark Bright killed it on the art for this series.
DAMAGE CONTROL
You've seen the ads for NBC's Powerless, right? A workplace sitcom set in the DC universe, combining humor with all the bloodless destruction these places seem to endure on a daily basis. Sounds like something perfectly fit for the Marvel Universe. Oh, ABC is developing something along those lines? Called Damage Control? And it's based on a comic from twenty years ago? I wonder what forward-thinking writer came up with that? Dwayne Mc—oh…
There's that name again.
Although the Damage Control series hasn't come out yet, and will have to take a backseat in the public eye to Powerless (unless that show tanks and makes the super-sitcom radioactive for a while), Marvel has put out a complete collection of the three McDuffie/Colón minis, as well as having the individual issues available on Comixology or Marvel Unlimited.
JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS & DOOM
Dwayne didn't just win awards for their comics work (an Inkpot in 2009), but their animation work garnered them Daytime Emmy, Writers' Guild, and Humanitas award nominations for series like Static Shock, Justice League, and Ben 10: Alien Force. It would be easy to say ‘just pick an episode with their name on it' (and a great idea BTW) but I want to call out these two in particular.
Crisis On Two Earths was originally going to be the bridge movie between Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. When those plans were scrapped, it ended up as a standalone DC Animated release (although squint and you can still see the Timmverse connective tissue). McDuffie mixes in a lot of the Morrison/Quitely “JLA: Earth 2” with the Gardner Fox-era “Justice League of America” #31-32 and general multiverse shenanigans.
Doom follows up Crisis on Two Earths and was the last script McDuffie worked on. It took the Waid/Porter “JLA: Tower of Babel”, where Ra's al Ghul (or Vandal Savage in this iteration) steals Batman's notes on taking down the Justice League, and made it work as a standalone feature. But as enjoyable as it was, there's a better reason to get the Blu-Ray than that main feature: “Dwayne McDuffie: A League of One”.
This half-hour documentary goes into real depth about McDuffie and what they brought to the table. Not just in their work, but in their life as well. It's heartwarming to see their family, friends, and peers from all walks of life talk about Dwayne and their humor, kindness, and intelligence. (Just as an aside, it absolutely *kills* me that for every puff piece and promo video WB throws out to YouTube to promote their videos, they can't do the tiniest bit of public service and put this out there for people to easily come across.)
But as heartwarming as all the testimonials are, it's just as heartbreaking to remember that all this talk is about McDuffie in the past tense. That this giant of a man has left a giant-sized hole to fill.
THE DWAYNE MCDUFFIE AWARD: “FROM INVISIBLE TO INEVITABLE”
First awarded in 2015, the Dwayne McDuffie Award for Diversity in Comics is a way to both honor McDuffie's legacy and to encourage in others the qualities that made their work so effective. McDuffie's “From Invisible to Inevitable” quote has been adopted as the main idea behind this initiative to give recognition to creators continuing the work and idea that they put into this work. Speaking to the LA Times just prior to the first year's award, Dwayne's widow (and fellow writer) Charlotte McDuffie said:
“I am so proud that my husband's personal mission to include a more diverse array of voices — both in content and creators — is able to continue now through this award in their name, by encouraging others who share their vision of comics, characters, and the industry itself better mirroring society.
This year's award was given out just this past weekend at the Long Beach Comic Con, going to Upgrade Soul cartoonist Exra Clayten Daniels. Previous winners include “MFK” cartoonist Nilah Magruder in 2015 and writer G. Willow Wilson in 2016 for their work with Adrian Alphona on “Ms. Marvel”. The award is handled by a panel of 12 judges, including Charlotte McDuffie, Len Wein, Joseph P. Illidge, Mark Bright, Gail Simone, Cassandra Pelham, Matt Wayne, and others.

Hopefully this brief list gives you a little more insight into who Dwayne McDuffie was, and why people are still talking about him. Do yourself a favor and find out more about the man here, and in enjoying the large body of work they left behind.
Judd Apatow's been going in on Bill Cosby lately.
Tuesday, the comedy producer continued to question the growing number of allegations against Cosby. Apatow tweeted a link to their more than one million followers of an old Cosby interview with Larry King.
In the interview clip, which was rebroadcast on Headline News, Cosby is describing a story about “Spanish Fly,” a drug that purportedly makes women “amarous.”
Cosby happily describes to CNN anchor Larry King the “powers” of the drug, as transcribed by FiveThirtyEight.com:
COSBY: Spanish Fly was the thing that all boys from age 11 on up to death — We will still be searching for Spanish Fly. KING: [laughs] That's right. COSBY: And what was the old- The old story was, if you took a little drop — It was on the head of a- KING: Pin. COSBY: -pin! And you put it in a drink- KING: That's right. Drop it in their Coca-cola — It doesn't matter. COSBY: It doesn't make any difference. And the girl would drink it and- KING: And she's yours. COSBY: -‘Hello, America!'
Monday, Apatow said Cosby “absolutely belongs in jail,” on the WTF Podcast. He's even tweeted an image of all the cities Cosby will visit on their upcoming tour, encouraging their followers to let the venues “know how they feel.”
USA Today's Ann Oldenburg recapped the reason why Apatow has come out so hard against Cosby:
Prostitute to Lady: Hillary Clinton FAILS in Pretty Woman Remake
Hillary Clinton lingers, because their work continues. Clinton's new job involves forcing people to see that she's really not a bitch.
Talk about one helluva marketing proposition.
Because people hate Hillary Clinton, and not just Conservatives. Many Leftist politicos privately wish they would disappear. But Hillary Clinton can't go away yet.
Reputation rightfully sullied, Clinton needs to rehab their reputation. Because when the sh*t hits the fan on all she's done, they will need populism to save the day.

Trending: SCOTUS Justice Send Warning to FAKE NEWS Journalists
Clinton's coronation-gone-wrong represented the “new” Clinton. Only nobody bought it. TBS wrote of one such makeover attempt:
Makeovers, resets, and do-overs seem to represent the norm for Hillary Clinton. Before they ever made their announcement to run for president, their close friend and Facebook CEO Sheryl Sandberg did their best to launch the “ban bossy” campaign. The Left wanted to ban this restrictive and sexist word because its negative connotations “kept girls from achieving”. What it was really designed to do was to keep Conservatives from labeling Hillary Clinton as “bossy”; ok, a bitch! Let's just say that campaign went over like Lewinsky at Chelsea's baby shower. Most recently, the “showing heart and spontaneity” world tour has begun, with all the choreography and scripting of all Hillary Clinton events. It was time to meet the new real, old Hillary (pun intended). Americans will now suddenly realize that we just did not know the “real” Hillary; you know, the one who has 47 bodies (and counting) in their wake. The new Hillary is the life of the party, loves to go out and have umbrella drinks with their girlfriends, and is a harmless doting grandmother.
We all know how that turned out. Donald Trump exposed the doting grandmother as an entitled elitist.
The Wall Street Journal's Jillian Kay Mechior pummeled Clinton next makeover attempt. Mechior writes of Clinton's vain attempt to buy influence within Teen Vogue:
Hillary Clinton expanded their already impressive résumé by guest-editing the issue that hit newsstands Dec. 5. It was a theme issue, with 36 pages devoted to a single subject: Hillary Clinton. That's more than the 31 pages of ads in the 97-page magazine. Mrs. Clinton commissioned several articles about herself. Staff writer Lauren Duca proclaims that “zooming out on Hillary's 2016 loss reveals the broader contours of women's oppression,” while Gloria Steinem says that when a woman is elected president, “she will be climbing steps that were carved out by Hillary.” The issue also features contributions from Chelsea Clinton and Betsy Ebeling, identified as Mrs. Clinton's “BFF.” There's a two-page spread of “Love Letters to Hill.” Readers are assured they are “personal notes” selected from more than 100,000 post-election missives Mrs. Clinton received from young women, including singer Miley Cyrus and actores Chloë Grace Moretz and Lena Dunham. The magazine helpfully advises: “Read with tissues in hand!” Then there's Mrs. Clinton's own love letter to Mrs. Clinton—or rather, to Miss Rodham. Framed as advice to their 18-year-old self, it includes such tips as “when president-elect Barack Obama says they want to talk to you about a job opportunity in their cabinet, hear them out.”
Hillary Clinton's version of Pretty Woman. Remember that movie?
In Pretty Woman, the billionaire playboy played by Richard Gere hires a prostitute. Julia Roberts plays the good-natured street prostitute (yeah right!) who catches Gere's eye.
The two make a deal for Roberts to be Gere's companion they decide to clean up. As in all Hollywood movies, tension develops between the two, but in the end, the prostitute becomes a lady.
Clinton attempts the same thing. Except in their version Clinton plays both roles. The Not-So-Pretty-Woman tries to turn an ugly old prostitute into a lady. But Clinton's version doesn't have the Hollywood ending.

A self-proclaimed Nazi dad who named their son Adolf and daughter Eva Braun has won approval to change their own last name to Hitler.
Superior Court Judge Michael O'Neill signed off on the request by Isidore Heath Campbell, granting Campbell's name change to Hitler from May 8.
"I'm named after a hero," Campbell reportedly said.
"The judge approved it.

"My name is Hitler now."
The dad had previously attracted headlines when a supermarket refused to decorate a birthday cake for their son, mycentraljersey.com reports.
Despite the atrocities of World War 2, the father claims Hitler was a hero because "he saved Germany, they brought up the economy in Germany, built the roads in Germany, gave them more jobs in Germany, they considered the people in Germany."

"Only Trump has considered the people in America.
"Only Trump has. The rest of them were only in office for a pocket full of money.
"Trump doesn't care about that. They care about the people."
One of their children is reportedly called Adolf Hitler Campbell while their daughter was named Eva Braun.
However, they had run-ins with social services over the years.

The effort will neither be private nor public, but a “third way.” This innovative, common-good model is made possible through a collaborative agreement between the Heritage Centre, the Town of Niverville and private partners.
The community-based, innovative effort to expand MRI, ultrasound, X-ray and laboratory services is modelled after Niverville's community-built and -owned 80-resident personal-care home. This model was supported by the previous NDP government in 2011.
The recent announcement that a new diagnostic centre will be built at the Heritage Centre in Niverville has generated spirited debate.
Hey there, time traveller! This article was published 30/8/2017 (545 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.
Hey there, time traveller!
This article was published 30/8/2017 (545 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.
The recent announcement that a new diagnostic centre will be built at the Heritage Centre in Niverville has generated spirited debate.
The community-based, innovative effort to expand MRI, ultrasound, X-ray and laboratory services is modelled after Niverville's community-built and -owned 80-resident personal-care home. This model was supported by the previous NDP government in 2011.
The diagnostic centre will help address unreasonable wait times Manitobans face for MRIs.
The effort will neither be private nor public, but a "third way." This innovative, common-good model is made possible through a collaborative agreement between the Heritage Centre, the Town of Niverville and private partners.
Tommy Douglas, the father of Canadian medicare, outlined that universal health care consists of two stages. The first stage is universal access to emergent, urgent and doctor care. The second stage, which Douglas felt was most critical, was "preventive care." They stated medicare is not sustainable without this second stage.
As patients, health-care providers and governments, we have failed to heed Douglas's declaration.
Niverville's "third way" addresses Douglas's prophetic words about the second stage. By overseeing the private partners' efforts to build the diagnostic centre at the Heritage Centre, our community is able to frame this "third way" collaboration. Included in this agreement is a "public-private-partnership" arrangement in which the diagnostic centre is donated to the Town of Niverville after 25 years — ensuring public interest and ownership is achieved.
Some will claim the public interest is not served by receiving an "old building" and "used equipment" after 25 years.
The legally binding agreement ensures the custom-built commercial building and advanced diagnostic equipment will not only be in good condition, but have many years of remaining life when donated to the town.
This "third way" creatively enhances the sustainability of Canada's health-care system by addressing Douglas's second plank.
The collaborative agreement calls for the creation of Heritage Life Community Health Services. This new not-for-profit entity will enable the Heritage Centre to facilitate all MRI orders. Through this unique arrangement, all MRIs will be arranged through the Heritage Centre as a third party, which is consistent with and allowed for in provincial legislation. This will provide Manitobans the option, with a doctor's requisition, to self-select an MRI either in Niverville or within the public system.
Manitobans already are self-directing their diagnostic needs by travelling to North Dakota for MRI services. Having an option closer to home will result in greater economic activity for the province. Critically, it will generate new income taxes, boosting the government's ability to support our health-care system.
This "third way" also supports Canada's Health Act accessibility provision. MRI fees in Niverville will be based on income, assisting those facing economic barriers who wish to self-direct their diagnostic needs. MRIs will be discounted by 25 per cent for families whose income falls within Manitoba's lowest income-tax bracket.
For those who qualify for a full discount at the diagnostic centre, the fee will be $750, the approximate base cost of providing an MRI in Niverville.
Manitoba's auditor general recommended in spring that the current practice of third parties, such as the Worker's Compensation Board (WCB), bumping patients on current MRI wait lists should stop. The Heritage Centre Board agrees. Niverville's new diagnostic centre will allow insurers such as WCB a reasonable option to access MRIs outside the public system. This would open up some 2,500 MRI spots at Pan Am clinic immediately, reducing its 29-week wait list.
To be sure, some will state this community-based, innovative "third way" is a step toward United States-style health care. It is not.
Niverville's initiative is seeded and vested in a community-based, not-for-profit social enterprise for the common good. Evidence-based outcomes in public health care make it clear more government expenditures will not address current challenges. We require greater innovation, community-based initiatives and a keen focus on medicare's second stage to reimagine and improve an ailing health-care system.
This innovative initiative ensures public ownership, over time, of the diagnostic centre. It provides reasonable accommodation to Manitobans seeking self-directed diagnostic services. It offers the possibility of immediately reducing current MRI wait times. Finally, it creatively ensures economic accessibility to Manitobans through an income-tested fee schedule.
Douglas often said, "Courage, my friends; 'tis not too late to make a better world," as they passionately campaigned for medicare in the 1960s. Niverville's "third way" approach is courageous and will lead to a better world for Manitobans as we strengthen universal health care in the 21st century.
Gordon Daman is a volunteer board member on the NHHI Board of Governors, which provides governance for the Niverville Heritage Centre. The centre is a not-for-profit community owned social enterprise campus that provides various community, social and seniors housing services for Niverville and region.
Private MRIs are moving us in a dangerous direction
There is an adage: if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.
This certainly seems to be the case with Niverville's recent announcement that the town hopes to partner with a private holding company and build a user-pay MRI clinic in the community.
The investors are billing it as "an innovative community response for the common good." They claim when some of us pay, MRI wait times for everyone will go down. And profits and investment will be kept here in Manitoba, rather than trickling down to North Dakota.
That all sounds wonderful, doesn't it? But only if you don't think about it too hard.
Let's start with claim No. 1: according to the Canadian Foundation of Health Care Improvement, countries with both public and private health-care systems always have the longest wait times. England and New Zealand, for instance, which have both public and user-pay hospitals, have longer wait times in their public systems than medicare systems such as ours.
JOE BRYKSA / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS FILES
This backs up evidence found here in Manitoba decades ago. Until 1999, cataract patients could choose to have their surgery at a private clinic by paying a user fee. While the fee was in place, Manitoba researchers found that patients whose surgeons worked in both public and private clinics had to wait 16 weeks longer — 26 weeks versus 10 weeks — than those whose surgeons practised only in the public system.
Turns out this was largely a staffing issue: there were only so many surgeons, and people can't be two places at once.
The same goes, of course, for Manitoba's radiation technologists. These highly trained people who run the MRI machines are already in short supply.
And if demand for privately paid scans is as high as advocates say it is (and the Niverville investors are banking on), then the technologists who perform scans for the private clinic inevitably will have to come from the public system, driving up wait times for the rest of us.
That bring us to their second claim: some people are already paying south of border to jump the queue. Why not keep that money here to make a few Manitobans richer?
The answer is because their profit-driven idea will not only increase diagnostic wait times for average Manitobans, it actually will allow the provincial Tory government to ignore solutions right under its nose.
The Dauphin hospital, for instance, already has completed an addition intended to house the first MRI in Manitoba north of the Trans-Canada Highway.
Staff already have been trained. Rural residents as far as The Pas finally are set to access diagnostic services that don't require travel two days away from home. All that's needed is the machine itself, already paid for and sitting in Germany, waiting to be shipped and installed.
In March 2017, however, the whole thing was put on hold by the government, which stated its Wait Time Task Force required at least a year of "further study."
You don't need to live in Dauphin, or work in the health system, to imagine what this delay is costing Manitobans like you and me, both in dollars and wait times. So why isn't the Dauphin MRI up and running?

I sure hope it's not because they're buying the Niverville investors' claims — "we can help those with cash get diagnosed first, reward a few savvy business people and save medicare, all at the same time!"
And I sure hope it's not because they're considering investing our tax dollars in supporting and sustaining a profit-driven approach to health care that will not even come close to benefiting all Manitobans.
The vast majority of us say medicare — a system in which no matter who you are, or where you live, your access to health care is based on need and not the size of your bank account — is our most cherished public service. Most of us say it's our most cherished thing about being Canadian. Even with our system's challenges, it seems watching the United States debate about health care is enough to remind us that what we've built is precious, and worth fighting for.
The reality is that what would benefit all of us most right now is embracing solutions that are both ready to roll and addressing wait times within our much-valued universal system, as in Dauphin, or investing in more trained radiation technologists.
Let's not get sidetracked by investors whose claims are simply too good to be true.

SanDisk just effectively doubled the capacity of SD-based memory devices, as they announced a one-terabyte prototype that will eventually head to stores.
It's a SanDisk Extreme Pro SDXC card, for anyone curious about which of SanDisk's many sub-brands this one fits into.
A terabyte is 1,000 gigabytes. That means if you're carrying around a 16GB iPhone right now, a memory card could hold that capacity 50 times over. When IBM's Watson debuted in 2011, it had about 16 TB of RAM and was the size of several refrigerators.
The card comes just two years after SanDisk achieved 512 GB capacity on a card.
There's no word on an exact release date, but when it comes out, uses for it will include totally optimized video recording, and pocketing a backup Skynet.

Crime
D Sridhar Babu allegedly tried to conceal ganja in Kishan Reddy's house to get them arrested.
Sudarshan: I'm planning to keep ganja in Kishan's house and get them arrested.
Sridhar Babu: Tell me when you are planning to keep it. And don't keep it in Duggal, it will be of no use. Keep it in Hyderabad [Kishan's house in Hyderabad]. Tell me a day before executing the plan.
Sudarshan: I will procure the Ganja today evening itself. Should I get 10 kgs of it [ganja].
Sridhar: Okay.
Sudarshan: We will keep the Ganja in their cattle shed and make it look like it was brought from their field.
Sridhar: Okay.
This was the leaked conversation between Sudarshan, a sarpanch from Karimnagar and former Telangana Congress Minister D Sridhar Babu, during which they allegedly plot against TRS president of Karimnagar, Kishan Reddy to frame them for possessing ganja (marijuana).
Sridhar, the former Civil Supplies Minister, has been accused of attempting to frame their political opponent Kishan Reddy, who is from the TRS. Sridhar allegedly tried to connive with two others to conceal ganja in Kishan's house and get them arrested.
Kishan Reddy is the TRS president in Mutharam mandal in Karimnagar district. According to reports, both Kishan and Sridhar Babu had differences over a few issues, for which the latter developed a grudge and tried to fix them in a criminal case.
Following the complaint from Kishan Reddy, the Chikkadpally police filed a case against Sridhar and two others, Sudharshan and Bhargav, under the NDPS (Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act.
Speaking to TNM, admin SI Nagul Meera said that they received the complaint on Friday. “We have filed a case under NDPS Act against Sridhar Babu, Sudarshan and Bhargav, a 20-year-old for trying to frame a case against Kishan Reddy,” they said.
They also informed that they also received audio clips from Kishan, which they are investigating.
Responding to the incident, Sridhar Babu, addressing the media on Sunday, stated that it is a case of political vendetta, and accused the TRS of witch-hunting.
They also accused the KCR-led TRS government of using the law enforcement agencies to threaten the opposition, and said that there's no substantial evidence to the claims. They termed it a ‘mud-slinging' programme.
Sridhar Babu was a three-time MLA from Manthani constituency in Karimnagar. They won consecutively from 1999-2014.
The rate of newborns with syphilis jumped 38 percent between 2012 and 2014 to its highest level in more than a decade, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday, though the overall numbers remained small.
The disease, which is transmitted from infected mothers to their fetuses, was found in 11.6 of every 100,000 births in 2014, up sharply from 8.4 in 2012 and the highest rate since 2001, researchers reported in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
Total cases were 458 last year, up from 334 in 2012, the data show. All parts of the country and every major racial and ethnic group experienced an increase. Whites showed the largest percentage jump, but blacks and Hispanic women gave birth to more children with the disease.
[More babies born at 23 weeks are surviving, study shows]
Lack of prenatal care among mothers was an important factor in the increase: 100 of the women had no such care, and there was no information on care for 44 others. Syphilis is easily treated with penicillin if detected in pregnancy, yet even among mothers who saw a doctor at least once, 21 were never tested for the disease and 52 were tested early in pregnancy but were later infected.
Among the newborns, rashes and enlarged spleens and livers were the most common problems associated with their infection, the researchers found.
They urged more screening and treatment of both women and men, as well as late-term screenings of women considered at high risk for syphilis.

Citing Louisville's rising violent crime rate and the department's Youth Explorer program sex abuse scandal, Metro Councilwoman Angela Leet is calling for police Chief Steve Conrad to resign.
"Unfortunately, I believe the time has come for a change in leadership,” Leet said. "I will no longer sit by and say it's the mayor's call and hope that action will follow. Instead I will step out and say that I no longer have the confidence that Chief Conrad has the ability to right the ship and help direct this city and its many neighborhoods to be the safe places we all desire."
But Mayor Greg Fischer stood by their top cop in a statement on Thursday, saying that Leet "laying all crime and societal problems at the feet of one man is an unrealistic" solution to a complex crime problem.
"It's also an insult to the hardworking men and women of (the police department) that the chief leads," Fischer added. "We will continue to work with urgency to make our city safer and once again request the entire community to join ... us in our cause."
An LMPD spokesperson said Thursday that Conrad has no comment.

Leet, R-7th District, said in an interview with the Courier-Journal that they are reaching out to other members to gain bipartisan support urging Fischer to act. They said a tipping point was at a public safety hearing this week where some members clashed with Conrad over police resources.
Conrad was peppered with questions Wednesday about a resolution that calls for the administration to put $9 million more in the budget to hire 100 new officers. The chief infuriated some council members when they refused to say how many officers the department needs, and that they wouldn't comment on their recommendations ahead of Fischer unveiling their spending plan next week.
“I no longer have the confidence that Chief Conrad has the ability to right the ship and help direct this city and its many neighborhoods to be the safe places we all desire.” Metro Councilwoman Angela Leet
"We asked the blunt question of what you think we should be at. He's our expert," Councilman Brent Ackerson, D-26th, who sponsored the measure, said in an interview Wednesday. "I don't feel like he's my expert anymore, because they won't tell me what they think is reasonable."
Leet said Conrad demonstrated during the committee meeting that "he is loyal to the mayor, and to the mission of the mayor and the community seems secondary." Other members had differing views on what Conrad's future should be.
Councilman Bill Hollander, leader of the 17-member Democratic caucus, said Thursday that Conrad serves as the pleasure of the mayor, who appoints all department and agency directors.
"I personally don't believe that a new chief can end our opioid epidemic, bring people out of poverty or solve the other societal problems which are contributing to crime," said Hollander, D-9th. "But I know the mayor and not any member of Metro Council makes this decision."
But Councilwoman Julie Denton, R-19th, said members have the right to speak out about the way Conrad is leading the police force. They said they support Leet's call for the chief to step down given how he's addressed gang violence and other issues.

"I don't know why Chief Conrad would want to stay — he's lost the confidence of the force, he's lost the confidence of the community including members of Metro Council," Denton said.

Councilwoman Jessica Green, D-1st, said they were reserving judgment on supporting Leet's call for the chief to resign until they could review the statement further but their concerns about rising crime continue to rise and that Conrad avoiding their questions about more manpower was a "slap in the face" to all members.
Councilman David James, chairperson of the Public Safety Committee, said they consider Conrad a personal friend but that their performance as chief has caused them great concern as of late. They said they plan to call the chief to testify soon about whether department's reorganization plan – which in September 2016 eliminated the so-called flex platoons to shift more resources to high crime areas – has worked to decrease the violence.
“If we see that hasn't taken place, it's probably time for the council to consider as a body if we have confidence in Chief Conrad leading the police department,” said James, D-6th.
“It's also an insult to the hardworking men and women of (the police department) that the chief leads.” Mayor Greg Fischer, on Leet's statement
The chief's role in the ongoing Explorer scandal has come under fire as a number of investigations have been launched.
Conrad dropped a 2013 internal affairs investigation into former Officer Kenneth Betts for having "improper contact" with a teenage girl in the program after they resigned the next year. Betts is one of two former police officers accused in a civil lawsuit of sexually abusing a boy in the program in their police vehicles and homes, and that they recorded it to create pornography.
Betts and former Officer Brandon Wood, whom Conrad fired last week, have been indicted on charges involving three victims. Betts is accused of sodomy and sexual abuse while Wood is charged with seven counts of sexual abuse. They pleaded not guilty Monday.
Fischer has temporarily suspended the Explorer program and asked the FBI to investigate whether the civil rights of any Scouts were violated. They also have hired former U.S. Attorney Kerry Harvey to investigate whether there was a cover-up within the department, as Metro Council President David Yates, who is representing four former Explorers, has alleged.

And last year Louisville recorded its highest number of murders ever and continues to deal with a surge in shootings and homicides.
Sgt. Dave Mutchler, president of the police union, said in a brief interview with the Courier-Journal on Thursday that Leet had informed them about their call, but that they had not seen them statement.
In December, fewer than 2 percent of police union members said they had confidence in Conrad's leadership.

NAPLES, Fla. — Tony Bartosiewicz called their children to let them know they were alive shortly after gunshots were fired at the baggage claim area of Terminal 2 at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport last week.
What they didn't tell them was that during the shooting, they used their body to shield a woman they didn't know.
Annika Dean, the Broward County woman Bartosiewicz shielded, sent their son a message on Facebook to say how grateful they were for what Bartosiewicz did.
Jenny Miller, Bartosiewicz's daughter, tried to call their dad to ask them whether it was true, but they didn't return their calls. Bartosiewicz, of Rochester, N.Y., had flown into the Fort Lauderdale airport to take a cruise with their wife, Jennifer Cleeton. The couple wanted to go home but decided to get on the ship Friday evening.
“We didn't find out until my niece texted them to ask, ‘Papa, did you land on someone and save their lives?'”
Miller, who lives in Denver, said. “He wrote back, ‘Yes I did.' ”
When the gunshots rang out inside the airport, Dean, a mother of two boys, dove to the ground, hid behind a luggage cart and prayed. As the gunman shot at almost a dozen people, Bartosiewicz lay on top of them and told her, “I will protect you.”
“Tony was my guardian angel,” Dean said.
The shooting was over in about 60 seconds, Dean said, and they all felt safer when law enforcement officers arrived.

Bartosiewicz was being patted down by the FBI and couldn't talk the first time their daughter called him.
When they could finally talk, Miller said their dad sounded shaken.
“He could barely get the words out,” Miller said. “At one point, they thought Jennifer had died. There was someone on the ground next to them with so much blood. Jennifer was on the ground curled up in the fetal position. When Dad went to her, they wouldn't get up. They thought the blood was hers.”
After being allowed to leave the airport Friday night, Bartosiewicz and Cleeton just wanted to go home, but they decided to go on their Caribbean cruise anyway.
“I don't think they're enjoying the trip in the way they should be,” Miller said. “They're probably going through a lot as far as trying to process the incident. I'm anxious for them to be home safely already.”
Miller, a therapist whose focus is treating people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, is worried about their dad having flashbacks from the shooting.
“I want to talk to them and see how he's doing,” Miller said. “I want to give them a big hug and probably cry with him. I think they need to be around people they love right now and to have a lot of support.”
The shooting made Miller wonder what they would do in the same situation. Would they fight or flee? They said they are afraid they would flee.
“My dad probably thinks what they did is just what everyone else would do, what they should do,” Miller said. “He's selfless. He's also a little impulsive. I think they probably saw them on the ground cowering and just had a feeling of wanting to protect her.”
Bartosiewicz doesn't want to be the center of attention, their daughter said, and they likely won't address any media requests, not even for their favorite journalist.
“He's just very humble,” Miller said. “Anderson Cooper reached out to him. They said, ‘Nope. Not even for Anderson Cooper.' ”

ALGOL
ALGOL, designed in 1958 for scientific computing, was the first block-structured language. It spawned a whole family of languages, and inspired many more, including Scheme, Simula and Pascal. The block structure of ALGOL 60 induced a stack allocation discipline. It had limited dynamic arrays, but no general heap allocation. The substantially redesigned ALGOL 68 had both heap and stack allocation. It also had something like the modern pointer type, and required garbage collection for the heap. The new language was complex and difficult to implement, and it was never as successful as its predecessor. Related publication Branquart & Lewi (1972).
BASIC
BASIC is a simple and easily-learned programming language created by T. E. Kurtz and J. G. Kemeny in 1963–4. The motivation was to make computers easily accessible to undergraduate students in all disciplines. Most BASICs had quite powerful string handling operations that required a simple garbage collector. In many implementations, the garbage collector could be forced to run by running the mysterious expression FRE("") . BASIC is now old-fashioned, but survives as a scripting language, in particular in Visual BASIC, which is an application development environment with a BASIC-like scripting language. These descendants invariably have automatic memory management as well.
C
COBOL
COBOL was designed by the CODASYL committee in 1959–60 to be a business programming language, and has been extended many times since. A 1997 Gartner Group report estimated that 80% of computer software (by count of source lines) was written in COBOL. Prior to 2002, COBOL had no heap allocation, and did well in its application domain without it. COBOL 2002 has pointers and heap allocation through ALLOCATE and FREE , mainly in order to be able to use C-style interfaces. It also supports a high level of abstraction through object-oriented programming and garbage collection (including finalization). Related link COBOL standardization.
Common Lisp
Common Lisp is the major dialect of the Lisp family. In addition to the usual Lisp features, it has an advanced object system, data types from hash tables to complex numbers, and a rich standard library. Common Lisp is a garbage-collected language, and modern implementations, such as LispWorks and Allegro CL, include advanced features, such as finalization and weakness. Related link Common Lisp HyperSpec.
C#
C# is a strongly typed object-oriented language created at Microsoft in 1999–2000. It is designed to run on the Common Language Runtime, the virtual machine from the .NET Framework. It also runs on the open source Mono runtime. Memory is automatically managed: memory is allocated when an object is created, and reclaimed at some point after the object becomes unreachable. The language supports finalization (classes may have destructor functions, which are run just before the object is reclaimed by the memory manager), and weak references (1) (via the WeakReference class). The garbage collector in the .NET Framework is configurable to run in soft real time, or in batch mode. The Mono runtime comes with two collectors: the Boehm–Demers–Weiser conservative collector, and a generational copying collector.
C++
Dylan
Dylan is a modern programming language invented by Apple around 1993 and developed by Harlequin and other partners. The language is a distillation of the best ideas in dynamic and object-oriented programming. Its ancestors include Lisp, Smalltalk, and C++. Dylan is aimed at building modular component software and delivering safe, compact applications. It also facilitates the rapid development and incremental refinement of prototype programs. Dylan provides automatic memory management. The generic allocation function is called make . Most implementations provide finalization and weak hash tables, although interfaces for these features have not yet been standardized. An object may be registered for finalization via the function finalize-when-unreachable , in which case there will be a call to the finalize function once the garbage collector has determined that the object is unreachable. Weak hash tables may have either weak keys or values, depending on a parameter supplied at allocation time. A hash table entry will be deleted once the garbage collector has determined that there are no strong references to the key or value of the entry, for weak key or value tables, respectively. Related link Open Dylan.
Emacs Lisp
Emacs Lisp or elisp is a dialect of Lisp used in the Emacs family of text editors, of which the most widely-used is GNU Emacs. Like most Lisps, Emacs Lisp requires garbage collection. GNU Emacs has a simple mark-sweep collector. It has been speculated that the non-incremental nature of the Emacs collector, combined with the fact that, prior to version 19.31 (May 1996), it printed a message whenever it collected, gave garbage collection a bad name in programming circles. Erik Naggum reported at the time: I have run some tests at the U of Oslo with about 100 users who generally agreed that Emacs had become faster in the latest Emacs pretest. All I had done was to remove the “Garbage collecting” message which people perceive as slowing Emacs down and tell them that it had been sped up. It is, somehow, permissible for a program to take a lot of time doing any other task than administrative duties like garbage collection. Emacs was originally written in Teco, not in Lisp, but it still had a garbage collector, though this was heuristic and conservative in nature. Teco-based Emacs was capable of running for weeks at a time in a 256 kB address space.
Fortran
Fortran, created in 1957, was one of the first languages qualifying as a high-level language. It is popular among scientists and has substantial support in the form of numerical libraries. Early versions of Fortran required the size of arrays to be known at compilation time, and the earliest Fortran compilers accordingly used only static allocation (however, the 1966 standard gave compiler writers freedom to use other allocation mechanisms). The Fortran 90 standard added recursion and automatic arrays with stack allocation semantics (though many compilers in fact allocate them on the heap). It also added dynamic allocation using ALLOCATE with manual deallocation using DEALLOCATE . Fortran 95 made it explicit that allocated arrays have dynamic extent and are automatically deallocated when they go out of scope. Related link Fortran standardization.
Java
JavaScript
JavaScript is a scripting language used by web browsers. The loose type system resembles other scripting languages, although the syntax follows C. There's a prototype-based object system. Note that JavaScript is not related to Java in any way except name. There's a standard by ECMA, known as ECMAScript. Despite the C++-like syntax (with new and delete operators), JavaScript is garbage-collected. Related link Standard ECMA-262: ECMAScript Language Specification.
Lisp
Lisp Machine
Lua
Lua is a dynamically typed language created by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes in 1993. The language supports object-oriented and functional styles of programming, and is designed to be easily embedded in a larger programming system as an extension or scripting language. Lua uses automatic memory management and comes with a non-moving incremental garbage collector supporting soft real time applications. This uses a software barrier (1) in order to be highly portable. The language supports weak references (1) in the form of weak (hash) tables, which have the unusual feature that their keys and values can be dynamically switched from being strong references to weak references, and vice versa (by assigning to the __mode field of the table's metatable). It also supports finalization (by assigning the __gc field of the object's metatable).
ML
Modula-3
An object-oriented descendant of Pascal. Modula-3 is mostly garbage-collected, although it is possible to use manual memory management in certain modules.
Pascal
An imperative language characterized by block structure and a relatively strong (for its time) static type system. Pascal was designed by Niklaus Wirth around 1970. Pascal was popular as a teaching language due to its small size, but it lacked many features needed for applications programming. Now it's been largely supplanted by its more feature-rich descendants Modula-2, Modula-3, and Oberon, mainly surviving in the popular Delphi development tool. Pascal uses manual memory management (with the operators NEW and DISPOSE ). The descendants mentioned all offer automatic memory management.
Perl
Perl is a complex but powerful language that is an eclectic mixture of scripting languages and programming languages. Perl programmers can work with strings, arrays, and associative arrays without having to worry about manual memory management. Perl is well-suited to complex text file manipulation, such as report generation, file format conversion, and web server CGI scripts. It is also useful for rapid prototyping, but large Perl scripts are often unmaintainable. Perl's memory management is well-hidden, but is based on reference counts and garbage collection. It also has mortal variables, whose lifetimes are limited to the current context. It is possible to free (1) the memory (2) assigned to variables (including arrays) explicitly, by undef -ing the only reference to them. Related link The Perl Programming Language.
PostScript
The PostScript language is an interpretive language with powerful graphics features, widely used as a page description language for printers and typesetters. The Level 1 PostScript language has a simple stack-like memory management model, using save and restore operators to recycle memory. The Level 2 PostScript language adds garbage collection to this model. See also VM (2), composite object, simple object. Related link Harlequin RIP.
Prolog
A logic programming language invented by Alain Colmerauer around 1970, Prolog is popular in the AI and symbolic computation community. It is special because it deals directly with relationships and inference rather than functions or commands. Storage is usually managed using a garbage collector, but the complex control flow places special requirements on the collector.
Python
Python is a “duck-typed” object-oriented language created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum. There are several implementations running on a variety of virtual machines: the original “CPython” implementation runs on its own virtual machine; IronPython runs on the Common Language Runtime; Jython on the Java Virtual Machine. CPython manages memory using a mixture of reference counting and non-moving mark-and-sweep garbage collection. Reference counting ensures prompt deletion of objects when their reference count falls to zero, while the garbage collector reclaims cyclic data structures. The language supports finalization (classes may have a __del__ method, which is run just before the object is destroyed), and weak references (1) (via the weakref module).
Scheme
A small functional language blending influences from Lisp and Algol. Key features of Scheme include symbol and list operations, heap allocation and garbage collection, lexical scoping with first-class function objects (implying closures), reliable tail-call elimination (allowing iterative procedures to be described tail-recursively), the ability to dynamically obtain the current continuation as a first-class object, and a language description that includes a formal semantics. Scheme has been gaining popularity as an extension language; Project GNU's extension package of choice, Guile, is a Scheme interpreter. Garbage collection is an important part of the ease of use that is expected from an extension language.
Simula
Simula was designed as a language for simulation, but it expanded into a full general-purpose programming language and the first object-oriented language. Simula I, designed in 1962–64 by Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl, was based on ALGOL 60, but the stack allocation discipline was replaced by a two-dimensional free list. It was Simula 67 that pioneered classes and inheritance to express behavior. This domain-oriented design was supported by garbage collection. Related publication Dahl (1963).

Congress is getting ready to pass a farm bill—the $500 billion piece of legislation that funds agriculture and nutrition programs—that will cut funding for food stamps. As Mother Jones reported last week, Democrats in the House are considering banding together to derail the bill entirely, thus preserving nutrition funding at its current level. Support for that idea is building.
The House and Senate are currently negotiating a compromise farm bill that will contain food stamps cuts somewhere between the $4 billion the Senate wants and the $40 billion the House wants. (These cuts will come on top of the $5 billion in funding reductions to food stamps that went into effect at the beginning of the month as extra stimulus money for the program expired.) On Thursday, Reps. Alcee Hastings (D-Florida) and Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.), co-chairs of the Congressional Homelessness Caucus—a group of House lawmakers devoted to policies that help the extremely poor—signaled that they are drumming up support for no votes on any compromise bill. The two lawmakers asked members of the caucus to sign a letter to the House and Senate agriculture committees opposing any cuts to the food stamp program, called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
“For those living without permanent housing, everyday life is extremely difficult,” the lawmakers say in the letter. “SNAP benefits provide these individuals with a limited opportunity to obtain nourishment.”
House Democrats wager that if enough House Republicans vote against a final farm bill because they think the food stamps cuts are not deep enough, only a small group of Dems will need to also vote against the bill in order to kill it. In this case, food stamps would continue to be funded at current levels.
There is precedent for this idea: the last food stamps battle. In June, the House failed to pass a farm bill that cut $20 billion from SNAP because 62 conservative Republicans thought that wasn't enough and 172 Democrats thought the reductions were far too deep. This time around, food stamps funding will probably be cut by around $10 billion in the farm bill, according to a Democratic aide. That means far more GOPers will vote against the bill. The more Republicans that House Speaker John Boehner loses, the more Dems he'll need to pass the farm bill. If Democrats don't play ball, they'll win—which could keep thousands of Americans from destitution. “For many families with limited resources living close to or at the poverty level,” Hastings and Johnson write in the letter, “cuts to food benefits [would] force them to choose between food and rent.”
Let me state one thing up front: in many ways, Persona 4 is an outstanding game. As its story has progressed over the course of a school year, I've formed a much closer connection to its cast of high school students than I have to the characters in most games. It has repeatedly made me laugh out loud, sometimes made my pulse race, and occasionally moved me, as its heroes have formed happy memories together and faced great challenges together. They confront these challenges in both the real world that every high school student must navigate, and in that other world they have the power to enter, a world where manifestations of the thoughts and feelings that reside in our subconscious take shape.
But for a game that is all about people coming to terms with the aspects of themselves that they have long repressed, Persona 4's treatment of two of its main characters, Kanji and Naoto, leaves a great deal to be desired. Initially, Kanji appears gay and Naoto seems to be transgender. However, rather than embracing these traits as interesting facets of two members of the game's core group, Persona 4 ultimately rejects them.
By clearly raising the idea in the player's mind that Kanji is gay and then rejecting that idea, Persona 4 sends the message that homosexuality is shameful and should not be accepted.
Let's start with Kanji. When you first hear about him, it's via a televised news report that characterizes them as a violent troublemaker. Soon, they become the latest person to appear on the Midnight Channel, and you and your fellow investigation team members venture through a television and into the mysterious world on the other side where subconscious feelings and desires are manifested. Kanji's realm is a steamy bathhouse, and as you make your way through it, you repeatedly hear Shadow Kanji (the embodiment of their repressed subconscious) express sexual desire for men. I was immediately intrigued. Here, I hoped, I would get a complex portrayal of a gay character, one who has sadly but understandably repressed their sexuality in response to societal pressure, who felt that they could not be accepted as a tough guy if people knew they were also gay.
Unfortunately, Persona 4 doesn't follow through on this potential. When Kanji confronts their shadow self and accepts who they are, they reveal not that they are attracted to men, but that they are just deeply afraid of (or maybe deeply dislikes) women. They recall things that girls have said to them in the past ("You like to sew? What a queer!") and says that they are more comfortable around men because, according to him, "they'd never say those awful, degrading things." (I'm not sure what sort of world Kanji lives in where men would never criticize them for liking to sew and do other things that are stereotypically considered feminine, but for the sake of the game, I'll go along with it.) However, at the end of the day, their issue is simply a matter of feeling more comfortable around men, not one of being physically attracted to them.
To me, this is a huge cop-out. It rings psychologically false; the ultimate truth of Kanji's character as someone who was just afraid of rejection because girls had been cruel to them in the past doesn't quite mesh with the imagery of their dungeon and the personality of their shadow self. By clearly raising the idea in the player's mind that Kanji is gay and then rejecting that idea, Persona 4 sends the message that homosexuality is shameful and should not be accepted.
Yosuke's attitudes about Kanji are problematic, and so is the game's way of handling them.
As the story progresses, we're periodically reminded that, had they been gay, Kanji would not have been fully accepted by the other members of the investigation team, and, in fact, some anxiety lingers later on about whether or not Kanji is truly straight. During a school camping trip in which the protagonist, Kanji, and Yosuke are gathered in the same tent, Yosuke goes so far as to ask, "Are we gonna be safe alone with you?" suggesting that in Yosuke's mind, if Kanji had been gay, they would also be prone to behave inappropriately. When Kanji tells Yosuke that they have no problem being around girls now, Yosuke asks them to prove it, saying that if they can't, "we're gonna be stuck here all night half scared to death." Yosuke's attitudes about Kanji are problematic, and so is the game's way of handling them. Rather than addressing Yosuke's negative perceptions of homosexuality, perhaps with a character arc in which their prejudices are challenged and they become more open-minded over time, Persona 4 lets their view of homosexuality as something to be feared stand unchallenged and unremarked upon, treating it as normal and acceptable.
Persona 4's treatment of Naoto is no better. Naoto, known in the media as the detective prince, comes to town to help the police with their ongoing investigation of the disappearances that are plaguing Inaba. Predictably, Naoto disappears himself, and the investigation team leaps into action to rescue him. Naoto's dungeon is a sort of bunker, with large metallic doors and flashing lights. When you finally descend to the deepest chambers of the bunker, you find Naoto declaring that they are about to embark on a "bodily alteration process." This process, they say, will result in "the moment of a new birth" and enable them to "walk a completely different path in life." Shadow Naoto then taunts Naoto, saying that Naoto is "such a cool, manly name" but that "a name doesn't change the truth. It doesn't let you cross the barrier between the sexes." Shadow Naoto then reveals to the investigation team that Naoto is physically female.
Here, I hoped that Persona 4 might go some distance toward redeeming itself. There's great potential in exploring the feelings of a young person who is struggling with their sense of gender identity. But again, Persona 4 let me down. After you defeat Naoto's shadow self, Naoto explains that they read many hard-boiled crime novels as a child, and admired the cool, detached detectives in them. It is not, Naoto says, that they are transgender that has led them to live as a boy for so long. It is simply that being female "doesn't fit my ideal image of a detective."
Much like what you discover to be the reality of Kanji's internal conflict, this internal conflict rang false. To me, it's unheard of for a person to go so far as to live as a gender other than the one they are physically assigned at birth simply because they feel a connection to fictional characters of that genre or because their assigned gender doesn't fit their ideal image of a person in a certain profession. Naoto says, "What I must strive for isn't to become a man. It's to accept myself for who I really am." It would have been so much more interesting and believable to me if "a man" was one part of who Naoto really was. (This doesn't mean that I think Naoto should have continued to desire surgery, as the scenario in their dungeon suggests; one can identify as and be a man or a woman regardless of one's physicality. See the film Boys Don't Cry, for instance, for a portrayal of a man who is no less a man for being physically female, even if not everybody they meet sees it that way.) The idea that they were just deeply confused about their own gender because of all those detective novels they read strains credulity and, like Kanji's story arc, reinforces the notion that queer identities are to be feared and rejected. (Because, in the original Japanese dialogue for the game, Naoto continues to refer to themselves using the male pronoun boku, I feel it is appropriate to refer to them with male pronouns, as well.)
The discovery that Naoto is physically female immediately trumps all of the years they have spent living as a male.
No sooner have you rescued Naoto than the other members of the investigation team significantly alter their treatment of him. Rise calls them "missy." Yukiko explains away Naoto's inability to deal with a particular situation by saying, "Naoto-kun is younger than us, and she's a girl." Yosuke, who, if their paranoid behavior around Kanji is any indication, would never have flirted with Naoto while believing them to be physically male, now tells him, "You're pretty cute when you're angry." And when the investigation team goes to a hot spring together, the girls in the group marvel at Naoto's female physique and remark on the softness of their skin and the silkiness of their hair.
Though Naoto has stated that, despite living as a boy for so long, they do not fully identify as male, these behaviors still struck me as disrespectful of Naoto's gender identity. Without asking them how they want to be treated, they immediately start speaking about them as if he's just another one of the girls in the group; the discovery that they are physically female immediately trumps all of the years they have spent living as a male. One of the most blatant examples of this comes when Kanji, who finds themselves attracted to Naoto, practically demands that Naoto participate in a school beauty pageant, saying that if Naoto does so, their doubts about themselves "will finally be cleared." "C'mon, make me a man!" they say, suggesting that if they were gay, they would not really be a man.
Even more troubling is the way that Naoto's gender expression can be altered by you, the player, if you pursue a romance with him. Of course, if Naoto were a real person, anyone who requested that they change their gender presentation would not be someone who respected and cared for the person they really are. But Persona 4 doesn't raise any ethical questions about you asking Naoto to drastically change; it's as if the game thinks this is acceptable, since deep down, Naoto is "really" female anyway. (Troubling attitudes about women in general surface periodically throughout the game, but that is a whole separate topic.)
Persona 4's handling of Kanji and Naoto is more than just a disappointing failure to engage with queer characters and queer issues.
The always thought-provoking Mattie Brice has written in detail about your ability to shape Naoto's gender expression in this post at the Border House. Brice writes, "There is a scene after you confess your love for Naoto when they ask the player if they want them to start talking with a higher pitch to their voice to sound more feminine, and if they choose to have a higher pitch, they will dress up in a girl's school uniform during the Christmas event. This event is more poignant in the Japanese version of this scene; instead of the pitch of their voice, they ask the protagonist if they minded Naoto's use of 'boku.'" In other words, you can cause a complete, fundamental shift in how Naoto sees and refers to himself. Brice continues, "The scene when Naoto dresses up in a girl's uniform completely transforms their personality; he's now always blushing, stammering, quiet, scrunched up as much as they can into himself… Naoto's Social Link was an extreme waste of an opportunity to explore the intricacies of a relationship when at least one partner is transgender."
I agree with Brice. In fact, I think Persona 4 is full of wasted opportunities, and that ultimately, its handling of Kanji and Naoto is more than just a disappointing failure to engage with queer characters and queer issues. By introducing the idea that Kanji is gay and that Naoto is transgender and then backing away from embracing those characterizations, Persona 4 represents a betrayal of its central theme about people learning to accept themselves and each other for who they are, and sends the message that such sexual orientations and gender identities are too scary to accept. I want to see more LGBT characters in games, but not like this. It's almost as if Persona 4 has some lingering issues dwelling in its own psyche that it hasn't quite come to terms with.
[tor-talk] Tor 0.2.3.12-alpha is out
Tor 0.2.3.12-alpha lets fast exit relays scale better, allows clients to use bridges that run Tor 0.2.2.x, and resolves several big bugs when Tor is configured to use pluggable transport like obfsproxy. https://www.torproject.org/download/download (Packages coming eventually.) Changes in version 0.2.3.12-alpha - 2012-02-13 o Major bugfixes: - Fix builds when the path to sed, openssl, or sha1sum contains spaces, which is pretty common on Windows. Fixes bug 5065; bugfix on 0.2.2.1-alpha. - Set the SO_REUSEADDR socket option before we call bind() on outgoing connections. This change should allow busy exit relays to stop running out of available sockets as quickly. Fixes bug 4950; bugfix on 0.2.2.26-beta. - Allow 0.2.3.x clients to use 0.2.2.x bridges. Previously the client would ask the bridge for microdescriptors, which are only supported in 0.2.3.x, and then fail to bootstrap when it didn't get the answers it wanted. Fixes bug 4013; bugfix on 0.2.3.2-alpha. - Avoid an assent when managed proxies like obfsproxy are configured, and we receive HUP signals or configuration values too rapidly. This situation happens most commonly when Vidalia tries to attach to Tor or tries to configure the Tor it's attached to. Fixes bug 5084; bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha. - Properly set up obfsproxy's environment when in managed mode. The Tor Browser Bundle needs LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be passed to obfsproxy, and when you run your Tor as a daemon, there's no HOME. Fix bugs 5076 and 5082; bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha. o Minor features: - Use the dead_strip option when building Tor on OS X. This reduces binary size by almost 19% when linking openssl and libevent statically, which we do for Tor Browser Bundle. - Fix broken URLs in the sample torrc file, and tell readers about the OutboundBindAddress, ExitPolicyRejectPrivate, and PublishServerDescriptor options. Addresses bug 4652. - Update to the February 7 2012 Maxmind GeoLite Country database. o Minor bugfixes: - Downgrade the "We're missing a certificate" message from notice to info: people kept mistaking it for a real problem, whereas it is seldom the problem even when we are failing to bootstrap. Fixes bug 5067; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha. - Don't put "TOR_PT_EXTENDED_SERVER_PORT=127.0.0.1:4200" in a managed pluggable transport server proxy's environment. Previously, we would put it there, even though Tor doesn't implement an 'extended server port' yet, and even though Tor almost certainly isn't listening at that address. For now, we set it to an empty string to avoid crashing older obfsproxies. Bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha. - Log the heartbeat message every HeartbeatPeriod seconds, not every HeartbeatPeriod + 1 seconds. Fixes bug 4942; bugfix on 0.2.3.1-alpha. Bug reported by Scott Bennett. - Calculate absolute paths correctly on Windows. Fixes bug 4973; bugfix on 0.2.3.11-alpha. - Update "ClientOnly" man page entry to explain that there isn't really any point to messing with it. Resolves ticket 5005. - Use the correct CVE number for CVE-2011-4576 in our comments and log messages. Found by "fermenthor". Resolves bug 5066; bugfix on 0.2.3.11-alpha. o Code simplifications and refactoring: - Use the _WIN32 macro throughout our code to detect Windows. (Previously we had used the obsolete 'WIN32' and the idiosyncratic 'MS_WINDOWS'.) -------------- next part -------------- A non-text attachment was scrubbed...

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow industrials eked out a slim gain on Monday to end at another record high, after the Nasdaq topped 4,000 for the first time in 13 years and then slipped to close below that level.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) shares rose 0.8 percent to close at $80.43, off an all-time intraday high of $80.57 after the world's largest retailer said it has chosen its next chief executive. The stock was among the Dow's best performers.
Energy stocks slipped following a deal to reduce sanctions on oil producer Iran. The S&P energy sector index .SPNY fell 0.8 percent.
Social media shares dropped in volatile trading.
Volume is expected to remain low this week, ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.
“Retailers are taking focus this week. Black Friday is coming up, so there will be obviously some positioning ahead,” said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas, referring to the hectic day just after Thanksgiving that's regarded as the start of the holiday shopping season.
The agreement between world powers and Iran to partially curb Iran's nuclear program was seen as bolstering positive sentiment, even though it may not increase Iran's oil exports. U.S. crude oil fell 75 cents, or about 0.79 percent, to settle at $94.09 a barrel.
Despite the pressure on the energy sector, the deal with Iran was viewed as having positive benefits for the market at large.
“Less tension in the Middle East is always a positive, and any drop in gas prices will essentially act as a tax break for consumers going into the holiday shopping season,” said Jeff Duncan, chief executive of Duncan Financial Management in St. Louis. “This is a real benefit for the economy.”
Notable social media stocks fell, with Facebook (FB.O) breaking through a technical support level at $45.80. Facebook shares slid 3.1 percent to close at $44.82. Yelp shares (YELP.N) fell 6.7 percent to $58.20. Twitter shares (TWTR.N) lost 4.7 percent to end at $39.06.
The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 7.77 points or 0.05 percent, to end at 16,072.54, another nominal record closing high. Earlier, the Dow hit yet another all-time intraday high at 16,109.63. But the S&P 500 .SPX dipped 2.28 points or 0.13 percent, to finish at 1,802.48.
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC added 2.924 points or 0.07 percent, to close 3,994.573. Earlier, the Nasdaq touched an intraday high at 4,007.093 - its first moved above 4,000 in 13 years. But the Nasdaq pulled back in late trading.
Healthcare and financial stocks were the day's winners, with the S&P healthcare sector index .SPXHC rising 0.4 percent and the S&P financial sector index adding 0.1 percent.
In contrast, Boeing (BA.N) shares fell 2.2 percent to $133 after the company advised airlines on Friday about the risk of engine icing problems on its new 747-8 and 787 Dreamliner planes. Shares of General Electric (GE.N), which makes the engines, dropped 1.3 percent to $26.73.
The U.S. stock market could still go higher, some analysts said, even though the S&P 500 is up 26.4 percent for the year and the Dow has risen seven weeks in a row.
“Not surprisingly, many investors are asking whether this sets us up for some type of pullback. In our view, the answer is a resounding ‘No.' While these results are excellent, especially in the context of weak economic and earnings growth, they are hardly out of the ordinary,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.

Teenager From U.K. Wins World Drone Racing Competition In Dubai
Watch the view from the drone's perspective as Tornado X-Blades Banni UK competes on the World Drone Prix track in a video posted Friday. Keep an eye out for the Dutch Drone Race Team's drone, lit in red. World Drone Prix YouTube
Ladies and gentlemen, start your tiny, tiny engines.
A roller-coaster-esque race course in Dubai hosted the World Drone Prix on Friday and Saturday — a contest for drone racers and manufacturers, with a $250,000 prize for the winning team.
The total prize money, including awards for runner-ups, freestyle flights and fastest lap, is a million dollars — significantly higher than the prize pot for similar upcoming races in New York and Hawaii.
The World Drone Prix, held for the first time this year, tests a drone's speed and a pilot's agility, with built-in obstacles and tight turns. Drone teams also have navigation choices to make — when and how to handle shortcuts and a "joker lane."
And just like racecars, the custom-built drones have to make pit stops — plopping down on cushions when it's time for a battery swap.
The track, which can shift and rearrange itself, features lighted lines beneath the drone paths and glowing loops marking the narrow targets the drones have to pass through. Both the track and the competing drones record live footage from various perspectives.
"Tornado X-Blades Banni UK" — the team shown in the video at top — took home the prize.
"Banni UK" is Luke Bannister, a teenager from Britain and the pilot for that team. You can learn more about the young pilot in a piece from The Independent last year.
WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State John Kerry will spend much of Wednesday meeting with senior members of the U.S. foreign policy establishment, as they attempt to press the case for U.S. engagement in Syria.
Kerry is scheduled to meet one-on-one with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger Wednesday afternoon, and address a meeting of the 25-member Foreign Affairs Policy Board Wednesday morning. On Wednesday evening, Kerry will host a dinner for FAPB members at the State Department, according to an official schedule.
Widely considered a godfather of U.S.-Russia relations, Kissinger served as Secretary of State under President Richard Nixon and President Gerald Ford. As the nation's top diplomat, they pioneered the idea of developing a détente, or cooperation based on shared interests, between the leaders of the world's two nuclear superpowers.
As the Obama administration seeks to work with Russia to craft a plan to rid Syria of chemical weapons, Kissinger could prove invaluable as both an adviser and a public ally.
On Monday, Kissinger told CNN they support President Obama's request for authorization of the use of military force in Syria, "for the limited purpose of penalizing the use of weapons of mass destruction."
The bipartisan membership of the Foreign Affairs Policy board reads like a "who's who" of leading experts in diplomatic, military and economic affairs. First assembled in 2011 by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the board's mission is to provide top American diplomats with "independent, informed advice and opinion concerning matters of U.S. foreign policy."
Strobe Talbott, president of the nonpartisan Brookings Institution and a former Deputy Secretary of State in the Clinton administration, is chairperson of the FAPB. An expert on U.S.-Russia relations, Talbott offered a qualified backing this week of Obama's request to authorize military strikes on Syria. The best case scenario, they tweeted, would be a deal based on Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's proposal that the U.S. suspend plans to strike Syrian targets in exchange for Syrian President Bashar Assad ceding their stockpile of chemical weapons.

Among the slights and stereotypes faced by Asian Americans, there is a pervasive theme: the assumption, by some, that they are not actually Americans. “Go back to where you came from,” many have been told at some point in their lives. And they are sometimes asked: “Do you speak English?”
That's not just an East Coast thing, as one might conclude from two recent episodes that stirred outrage among Asian Americans. An editor at The New York Times wrote this week about a stranger yelling at them and their family to “go back to China.”
The insult — driving home the sense of “otherness” that they said Asian Americans struggle with every day — followed a Fox News stab at humor that had interviewer Jesse Waters wade into New York's Chinatown with every cliché in the book.
We asked our readers if they have ever experienced such insults, and more than a dozen people offered their stories. They told of offensive questions, slurs hurled from cars, sexual fetishism and greetings of “ni hao” to anyone who looks Asian, no matter the ethnicity.
“Having grown up in Missouri, I assumed liberal Pac-Rim-influenced Seattle would be a ‘safe' zone from me,” wrote a former Seattle P-I food critic whose editors received a letter asking why they hired “a fortune cookie” instead of an American.
“But my colleagues had my back,” wrote former critic Hsiao-Ching Chou. “Our publisher sent this response: ‘Dear Sir: We are in receipt of your letter. We did hire an American.”

One of the things that I have found most undermining and damaging is the perception of the model minority stereotype that has pervaded my experience as an AAPI woman in both the workplace and the local arts community. I am frequently referred to as being “academic” which is another way of saying “intellectual” or “intelligent” or “smart” but in a context that denotes otherness within a popular cultural context. This has been said to me in the context of nonprofit job interviews and in response to public presentations of my writing. Once, after a public reading, a writer of color attacked me on a public blog for an arts org and described me as “academic” and “awkward” playing up stereotypes of AAPIs.

I was the food editor at the Seattle P-I from 2000-2007. During that time, I wrote about every kind of cuisine, local farmers, regional foodways, everyday foods, high-end foods – a good mix that hopefully offered a little something for everyone. One day, our editors received a letter from a reader who suggested that instead of hiring a “fortune cookie” to cover the food scene that the P-I should have hired an American. Having grown up in Missouri, I assumed liberal, Pac-Rim-influenced Seattle would be a “safe” zone for me. Alas, the bubble is permeable. But my colleagues had my back. Our publisher sent this response: “Dear Sir: We are in receipt of your letter. We did hire an American.”

Where do I begin? Should I start by regaling everyone of the innumerable times I was asked as a child, “Are you Chinese? Japanese? Well then what ARE you?” Or should I talk about the times when cold strangers and friends alike would teasingly get in my face and pull at the corners of their eyes, lilting their “Ching Chong” chants? How about the time just last week, when I walked past a jewelry store at the nearby mall and the well-dressed manager at the front, trying to lure people into their store called after me, “Ni hao! Ni hao!”
For the record, I am Korean.
I am often reminded of my seeming dual vulnerability as an Asian-American and as a woman when I walk down the street and hear the odd man call out leeringly, “Hey Chinese princess,” or “Come here and give me a little bit of Asian loving.”
It's hard to speak about any of these times because even as a grown adult thinking about the long gone past, I always feel the reverberating heat of shame and humiliation. Even as I try to remember that it's their ignorance and not my identity that is to be blamed, I can't help but become angry at myself for never speaking up. In fact, I've spent an inordinately large portion of my life thus far, mentally concocting witty, shut-them-up retorts to each of my past taunters. I relish the thought of making them finally see and finally understand that there IS a difference between different Asian countries, that there IS a reason why each should be uniquely recognized, and — more than anything else — that I have the right to claim my place and my belonging here without having to forfeit the love I have for a culture and country where I have my familial roots.

In 2011, I was a part of the Chinese Expulsion Remembrance Project spearheaded by Bettie Luke and other members to remind people of the anti-Chinese sentiment that people in Seattle had 125 years ago … A march was organized starting from where the Chinese immigrants were forced onto ships close to Washington Street under the Viaduct and went east towards Chinatown to end at the Wing Luke Museum —retracing the route of the expulsion for a message that we are here to stay. I was invited to be a speaker at one of the stopping points along the march. It was a point of pride for me to have an opportunity to speak being an undergraduate at UW. As I marched arm-in-arm with my friends, I recall angry people yelling out of their cars for us to move, that we were blocking streets for no good reason, that the dragon we had as a part of the march was a beast of the devil, and ultimately for us to “go back to our country.”
Go back to my country? I was born here in the United States, in Seattle. My parents' lives were disrupted by the Vietnam War. It was my mother who risked their lives as a boat person to try and find a better opportunity for their family. Isn't that what the whole American Dream is about? Why is it that the American Dream only fits the narrative of the early European immigrants but not for immigrants and refugees of color? My parents made a home here for my brothers and I. This is my home.

Growing up in Sammamish, and later moving to Bellevue, people have thrown things at me from cars, yelling similar anti-Asian slurs. Regardless of who I am or what I've accomplished, people see my race first. It doesn't matter that it makes even less sense because I'm only half Asian, or that I'm native born … People should not be harassed due to their race.

This article really resonated with me as I have experienced racist comments throughout my life. I was born in America. My parents were born in America. Yet, many of my fellow Americans see the color of my skin and make incorrect assumptions that I must be from another country.
I work as a mortgage loan officer and a few years ago while working in my bank, a customer stopped in with some questions about their mortgage. They inquired with our bank manager if there was someone who could assist her, and my manager pointed to me sitting in my office. The customer then proceeded to whisper in a low tone to my manager “Do they speak English?” My manager, startled by the question, stated “Probably better than everyone else in the bank.” After the customer left, my manager shared the incident with me and we both laughed it off, but it has stuck with me all these years.
I might add, that also walking through the parking lot of the bank, I've had several drive-by racial insults spewed at me over a period of two years in (Monroe). Even though I live in a supposedly “progressive” state (Washington), I (and my wife) encounter racism on a regular basis.

A few months ago, I was in Ballard to join my friends for happy hour. As I was locking up my bike at Market and 24th, a guy on the street started catcalling me. I ignored him, and they walked off in a huff, yelling to the passersby on the busy street: “Whatever, they don't speak English anyway.”

While I seldom encounter implicit bias at work, they do happen from time to time. Whether it's a seemingly benign imitation of my accent or the smell of the food I am eating, followed by “that smells gross” or a blatant “have you eaten dog?” are profoundly disturbing. My response is always to educate ignorance and bad manners, as Mr. Luo has done. There is a movement within the professional world that seeks to diversify its workforce. Enhancing cultural capital, it additionally promotes understanding, communication and positive outcomes as research evidence suggests. Diversity is the answer to dismantling racism and xenophobia.

The death of the GOP health care proposal is actually a bipartisan opportunity.
At least it could be, according to President Donald Trump.
Two crucial Republican senators defected Monday night, sinking the Senate's American Health Care Act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell then began making the even more unlikely pitch for a straight repeal of Obamacare. By Tuesday, that looked doubtful, too, and Trump was looking ahead to the collapse of Obamacare (an event they could have a direct hand in) at which point they think Democrats would be forced to join in and craft something new.
But would they? In New York, at least, it's hard to imagine.
A Democratic win, for now
Democrats now have the chance to step back and regroup after a few months of frantic protesting and lobbying and standing firm against the GOP effort. It's something of a strange position for New York progressive activists who spent much of 2017 at the ramparts.
Fight Back Bay Ridge, a group that came together to protest Trump, organized marches and meetings with Rep. Dan Donovan of Staten Island and Brooklyn, the city's lone Republican member of congress. The group declared victory when Donovan announced that he'd vote against the GOP plan in the House during its first iteration, and group members have thanked them for remaining firm ever since.
Recently, the group had been planning a rally at Donovan's offices around Labor Day about the investigation into Russian interference and potential Trump campaign collusion. McConnell's health care failure was welcome news. “Right now, we're just kind of relieved that the Senate failed to pass McConnell's bill,” said group co-founder Sally McMahon. “But we don't want to sit around, and wait and see what happens.”

For Fight Back Bay Ridge and other progressive groups, that has meant a renewed push toward single-payer or Medicare-for-all-style health care.
“Attempts to maintain Obamacare really don't address the issue,” says Jabari Brisport, a City Council candidate from Brooklyn who has been endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America in New York. A single-payer system would be the way to answer the “flaws” of Obamacare, Brisport says, including providing the ability to negotiate on a federal level with insurance and pharmaceutical companies.
Locally, like-minded allies are pushing for a single-payer system in New York. The proposed New York Health Act stalled in the Republican-controlled State Senate this year.
For many, that situation is much more palatable than the national fight they'd been forced into: defending Obamacare once again.
“We have to rejoice that this Republican bill didn't pass, but we're not at all happy with the current situation either,” says Ron Widelec of Long Island Activists.
What comes next?
Navigating that tricky national situation has been Sen. Chuck Schumer, New York's senior senator and the Senate's minority leader who is leading the party's political strategy. In that position they have largely attempted to avoid potential claims of blanket obstructionism that Democrats used to hound Obama-era Republicans, as well as remaining the anti-Trump rock that many of their constituents expect.
Though Schumer hasn't endorsed the idea of single payer like their fellow New Yorker Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, they have stood resolute against all versions of the GOP plan. No Senate Democrats crossed party lines.
But will Schumer maintain their hero status if they begin to entertain Republican proposals to tweak Obamacare? They have said that Congress should work together to lower premiums and improve the health care system, on the condition that Republicans abandon ideas like gutting Medicaid.
Will they newly energized health care advocates among their constituents accept such overtures, even if they are only the posturing of bipartisanship?
Crowds gathered around Schumer's Park Slope home multiple times after Trump's election to protest hints of cooperation. Elizabeth Zeldin, who helped organize those demonstrations, says that was already a “very different era.” The activists were concerned by the possibility, which seemed real at the time, that their representatives would compromise with parts of the Trump agenda. Because of that agenda's diffuseness and often sharp radicalness, Democrats didn't have to.
But if they did, the debate could be more difficult.
It's been a weird couple of days for Mass Effect Andromeda. First, there was a rumor started by someone trying to claim to be from a company that works with BioWare on Mass Effect DLC, saying that single-player Andromeda DLC wasn't coming to the game.
BioWare pushed back on the source, saying they'd never worked with the company, but then killer of dreams, Kotaku's Jason Schreier, stepped in to say that while even though that originally sourced rumor was a hoax, their own, actual sources confirmed the crux of what was being said: There is no single player Andromeda DLC coming.
BioWare and EA, for their part, have confirmed or denied none of this, but Schreier's reveal makes a certain amount of logical sense given that we know that BioWare Montreal has been shuffled around to mostly be working on new, non-Mass Effect projects. Andromeda is still getting bug fixes and post launch support with some multiplayer content, but there seems to be no one left to even make single player DLC.
All of this makes me very sad.
It's a radical departure for BioWare, who has created some of the most engaging single player DLC in gaming across the last three Mass Effects, to not even put out one mission pack for Andromeda. And this is even with the end of game clearly building in a plotline for future DLC, namely (spoilers) a bit at the very end where the player receives a distress signal from the running-behind-schedule Quarian Ark, and Ryder is presumably going to be called on to rescue it.
Where we are reflects two realities, both of which are huge bummers:
1) Mass Effect Andromeda was really a letdown for EA due to poor reception and likely less-than-needed sales for such a huge game, and it seems like they're mostly cutting their losses and moving BioWare to focus on the next ten years of Anthem, leaving Mass Effect in the dust without a new sequel or even Andromeda DLC on the horizon as a final farewell.
2) Single player DLC is becoming increasingly expensive and unattractive. Even for hugely successful games, it's deemed that resources are often better allocated elsewhere. Case in point would be GTA 5, which previously created amazing single-player DLC for the series, and yet the game has abandoned it entirely to simply make more content for GTA Online, a much more profitable venture. Here, rather than spending even more money on single player missions, EA is probably tasking BioWare to spend far less just updating multiplayer, which is sustained by gacha-like microtransactions, and may still be profitable among a core playerbase. A big DLC pack is an expensive risk for a game that was itself an expensive risk that didn't pan out as anticipated.
Still, I want this Quarian Ark DLC. I understand the rationale behind why it's probably not being made, but it's tragic to see EA shuffle BioWare Montreal along so quickly to other projects. And if I'm being totally honest, EA cracking the whip to get Andromeda out before the end of their fiscal year is probably what contributed in part to its failings. Yes, the game had many core issues after a rocky development process, but the facial animations and other glitches that were mocked mercilessly before launch have been addressed in the last few months, and probably wouldn't have been in the game at all with say, an August launch.
DLC would have been a chance for BioWare Montreal to get it right, and send Mass Effect off properly, seeing as that it's going on an indefinite hiatus. Instead, EA is trying to get as far away from Andromeda as possible, ignoring just how much the series means to its fans. I'm not sure I've seen another playerbase get so heavily invested in a single player story like we've seen across the original trilogy, and many were on board with Andromeda, despite its issues. Mass Effect was one of the best video game universes out there, and now it's…what, exactly? Gone? Dead? In frozen stasis for a decade? Nobody really knows, and no one who would know is talking.
I get that Anthem and these other projects are important, but giving Mass Effect a more definitive send-off than the end of the Andromeda base game allowed would be appreciated by fans. And day one player like me really haven't even seen all the changes made to the game since launch as we beat the game before the fixes went live. This would be a chance to go back with new content and say “oh okay, so this is how it was supposed to be in the first place.”
I don't think this will happen. With the performance of Andromeda, the business decision is to cut losses and move on to projects with more relevance. And with the entire industry starting to pull away from flat-rate, often expensive DLC, this isn't entirely unexpected. But it's still sad as a fan. Mass Effect not only feels dead, but now it's like we're being told there's no time for a eulogy.
Follow me on Twitter and on Facebook. Pick up my sci-fi novel series, The Earthborn Trilogy, which is now in print, online and on audiobook.
Netflix had already made big strides at appealing to global audiences in late 2014 with the lavishly budgeted Marco Polo. But its newest original series, Narcos, may prove to have an even greater appeal with the story of Colombia's most notorious bad guy, Pablo Escobar.
Narrated by DEA agent Steve Murphy (played by Boyd Holbrook), it's made for fans of Scorsese movies and chronicles Escobar's journey from small-time smuggler to head of the Medellin cartel during the cocaine-fueled ‘80s. The fact that the streaming giant has ordered a second season only means more people are likely to discover it.
There's a lot of creative power by way of Brazil on Narcos, which was shot on location in Colombia and boasts a well-rounded international cast. Director José Padilha (Elite Squad, Robocop) is an executive producer and directed the first two episodes, while fellow brasileiro Wagner Moura gets the challenging yet exhilarating task of bringing Pablo to life onscreen. A renowned actor who has worked with Padilha before, Moura imbues the character with enough complexity that you forgive the Brazilian accent.
Why is SoundCloud Focusing on Brazil?
Then there's the music. Rio de Janeiro born and raised composer Pedro Bromfman created the hauntingly beautiful score for the series, and is on board to reprise their critical behind-the-scenes role in season 2. And Rodrigo Amarante, who recently released their debut solo album Cavalo, wrote and performed Narcos' entrancing theme song, “Tuyo.” In a memorable scene from the first episode, we see Pablo in a bar, deep in a conversation with “Cockroach” about how well they think their product will sell in Miami. Suddenly, they hear a familiar tune and starts singing along to a few verses from “Tuyo.” The track, custom written for the series, debuted at No. 13 on Latin Digital Songs in the chart dated Sept. 19 and No. 6 on Latin Pop Digital Songs. It's Amarante's first charting song, but we get the feeling it won't be theirs last.
Billboard spoke to both Los Angeles-based creatives separately over the phone about how they contributed layers of color and intrigue to the story.
How did you get involved with the series?
Rodrigo: It was a happy coincidence. The director of the series, José Padilha, has a cousin who made a documentary that came out last year about my band [Little Joy]. They told me they saw the doc and got really intrigued about who I was. After listening to my music, they talked to Wagner [Moura, who plays Pablo Escobar], whom I've worked with before. I was the musical director for this big Brazilian production of Hamlet quite a few years ago that they starred in. And they both loved my music, and thought that I would do a good job at this.
Pedro: José and I have done three movies together before Narcos. We've known each other for a long time. My first feature film was Elite Squad (directed by him), and whatever he's involved with I'm just happy to do. Narcos' executive producer, Eric Newman, was also a producer on Robocop, which we've done together as well. And then Wagner [Moura] is an old friend, so it's really a family that's been doing things together for a while now.
There have been many interpretations of Pablo's life on film and TV. How did you approach the music so that it felt original and authentic?
Rodrigo: It wouldn't be as interesting, at least to me, to do a song that was straight out of that time period and that place specifically because the story itself should reflect universally. So my approach was to humanize Pablo by writing a song that seemed like a view from the inside of the character, rather than a view from the outside. I had this idea to write a song that was their mother's favorite when they were a kid, something that would influence their idea of the man that they would like to be. I read a lot about Pablo and what their upbringing was. Apparently their mother was a big Carlos Gardel fan, as was everybody in Latin America during the ‘50s, but Gardel actually died in Medellin in a plane crash, which made their connection to the city a bit stronger. I didn't want to make it a tango, but that was the route that I took. The way the lyrics are written and the way the production sounds is all about Pablo's transition from childhood to manhood, which is what defines him. I wanted to deliver something romantic and deceivingly generous but if you listen to the lyrics you see that there's a narcissistic point of view. All of those men were all children at one point, so in my head the song gives the viewer a bit of context, rather than just saying, "Oh, these guys are animals." I think there's more to it.
Pedro: Each person has their process, but I didn't reference any existing movies or shows about Pablo Escobar -- the same way an actor sometimes tries to stay away from an existing performance before diving into character. The idea was to use a lot of Colombian instruments. I play some of them because I grew up in South America, but others were new to me. It wasn't about necessarily playing Colombian rhythms at all times but to create that flavor. At the same time there were spots where we needed cumbias and local rhythms so I went deep into that, but 80 percent of the score is a really suspenseful crime/action score using the flavor of those instruments. We brought all of those instruments into the studio, and I was exploring and playing with them, then I recorded them, and then we would bring them into the computer so I could make ambiances out of those organic sounds. They aren't synthesized and I think the audience can somehow feel that.
What instruments did you end up using?
Pedro: In South America, north of Argentina, they have the charango, and the ronroco, which is a deeper, bassier charango. I played a lot of those. We also used a lot of accordion and some harmonicas. I had this splash of inspiration from Sergio Leone westerns with Ennio Morricone scores. There are some other instruments that are completely foreign to Colombia. There's one called the hang from Switzerland, which has this deep, haunting, metallic sound that I use in a few scenes. I always like to use the traditional instruments but I also bring in some foreign sounds. I played a lot of the flutes from Colombia and Peru, then I brought them into the computer and reversed them. It creates this ambience that you don't really know came from a flute originally. It's a modern, original kind of score.
How was your experience writing for a streaming series different than your other work?
Rodrigo: So this is the first time that I do something like this. I've worked in theater before but for film and TV, I've done very little and nothing of this magnitude. When I talked to my friends who do that stuff, they said, "Be ready for revisions." And I was ready, but I was also very sure of what I wanted and I knew where I was coming from. I made sure to talk to everyone in person and explain what I was going for. So when I presented the song they said, "Amazing, good job, done!" I felt that it paid to give it some thought and actually communicate with the creators. In film it's very easy to be redundant. The show is about cocaine and gangsters, so I could easily write a song that's heavy and nervous and Latin. But how would that expand the story? So I was very happy that they liked my approach. I've said this before, that the only reason to tell the story of a monster is to reveal the monsters that we ourselves have [within us]. Otherwise what is the point? Separating people between good and bad, classify them as angels and monsters? Life isn't like that.
Pedro: It was my first time working with them [Netflix.] I've never had such a smooth ride. I feel like they hire the creatives they want to work with, like Padilha, or [David] Fincher for House of Cards, and they give them a lot of creative freedom. They're not as dependent on the success of the show. A lot of times a network series will shoot a pilot or a few episodes and then it will only go on if a lot of people tune into to watch it. Netflix approves a whole season before the first episode is even shot. The response to this has been amazing. We all thought we had gold in our hands but to be honest I didn't really expect the response to be this amazing in the U.S., especially given that the show has a lot of subtitles. Pablo Escobar was such a monster but he's such a fascinating character. They were a family man, they wanted to be president of Colombia and help the poor but at the same time he's willing to take down a plane full of people to kill a presidential candidate. It's such a dichotomy and the music reflects that.
What's next for you?
Rodrigo: I don't know how much I can say about the project, but because of Narcos, I've been asked to do a full feature film score and it's a big production so I'm very excited. I've never done that before. I have been hired as an arranger before, but for records, including Gilberto Gil's latest album. I'm starting to write my new record now, which I should be recording at the end of the year. A lot of people might think that “Tuyo” is my style, which it's not really. But it doesn't hurt, of course. I just hope that most of them will have a happy surprise [laughs].
Pedro: I am onboard for the second season. We have a few ideas and I think everyone was very happy [with the score]. They brought me in before they even started shooting the first season. Some of the main scenes I wrote from the script way back when and sent it to them and they listened to it on set. Sometimes you start a project really early on and a lot of the stuff you do ends up having to go in a different direction once you see the images but with this one, it was right on the money from the first piece, which is the song that opens the show and follows them throughout. I'm really happy with the music.
Don't blame overseas investors for the high price of housing in the Toronto area, says the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB). The board is releasing new research Tuesday showing fewer than 5 per cent of the 113,133 residential real estate transactions in the Toronto region last year involved foreign buyers.

More than half of those foreign buyers were purchasing homes for themselves or to house family members, according to a November Ipsos survey of TREB agents, who acted on behalf of those buyers. About 25 per cent of the homes purchased by non-Canadians were bought as rental investments. Related: Housing conditions problematic in several Canadian cities including Toronto, CMHC says

Vancouver Real Estate Board releases 2016 home sales figures Toronto house prices climb more than 22 per cent The data suggests that a foreign buyer tax such as the 15 per cent implemented in Vancouver last summer would be misguided, says TREB. A similar tax here could have "unintended consequences" — potentially pushing up prices in communities outside the Toronto area where there is no such tax. It could also further reduce the tight supply of rentals and discourage immigration to the area, said the board. The survey also found that fewer than 2 per cent of TREB realtors had acted in a sale in the Toronto area that was pushed east by the Vancouver tax.
The cost of a home in the Toronto region is expected to rise substantially — between 10 and 16 per cent — again this year. That would mean the average price of a home in December of $730,472 would grow to $825,000 on average this year.

That cost was up 20 per cent in December over the same month in 2015. "Detached and semi-detached houses and townhouses will experience the strongest annual rates of price growth, but the condominium apartment market segment will remain tight as well," said a TREB press release. An Ipsos survey of home buyers found the average purchaser expects to put down 27.6 per cent on a home this year, with first-time buyers expected to put about 24 per cent down on their purchase. While fewer consumers are expected to buy a home this year than was indicated in the previous survey, the number of first-timers expecting to enter the market increased slightly to 53 per cent from 49 per cent. Buyers indicated they are using various sources for down payments including savings, RRSPs, gifts from family and equity from their existing homes. TREB said it expects a third consecutive year of more than 100,000 sales forecast but with slightly fewer this year. The lack of supply will be the biggest impediment to those wanting to get into the market, said TREB officials. "Active listings at the end of December were at their lowest point since before 2000. It is unlikely that the shortage of listings will improve to any great degree over the next year," said Jason Mercer, the board's director of market analysis. TREB is also expected to release research on Tuesday showing that home values will rise as much as 12 per cent depending on their proximity to GO Transit's Regional Express Rail improvements that are expected to provide 15-minute, two-way service in many areas.
Damascus, SANA – Terrorist organizations continue to block the besieged residents of Yarmouk Camp neighborhood in Damascus from gaining access to humanitarian aid by targeting the convoys sometimes and attacking the
residents at other times.
The terrorists' attacks, which have included gun, sniper and mortar fire, often occur upon the arrival of representatives from the General Authority for Palestine Arab Refugees (GAPAR) and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) at the site where the relief supplies are being distributed.
GAPAR Director General Ali Mustafa told SANA in a statement on Saturday that the convoys in Yarmouk Camp, a neighborhood hosting Palestinian refugees and Syrian citizens, had to leave the distribution site in al-Rama Street today and go back to their headquarters in Damascus after terrorists opened fire on the site.
Mustafa confirmed that the residents who gathered in the distribution site, located at the medical center affiliated to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), also came under the terrorist gunfire and mortar attack.
A similar attack took place two days ago in which a woman and two children were injured.
The terrorist organizations besieging the neighborhood's residents have been for the sixth week now trying to prevent access to the humanitarian aid, as Mustafa stressed, with the aim to continue starving the people and keeping them as hostages to achieve political objectives.
Mustafa, however, affirmed that the Syrian government will continue providing all facilitations to UNRWA to ensure the aid delivery and distribution in Yarmouk Camp, noting that the supplies have been increased by 500 food
packages and 500 packages containing medical supplies.
Since January 30, 2014, the GAPAR has distributed around 60,000 food packages and 12,000 medical supply packages, while around 7,000 students and people with critical medical situation were evacuated.

The proportion of Americans with a college degree has increased steadily each year for more than a decade. According to the latest U.S. Census data, 29.6% of Americans at least 25 years old had at least a bachelor's degree last year, up from 27.9% in 2009.
Based on recently released educational attainment data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, West Virginia had the lowest level of educational attainment, with 18.9% of adults 25 and older having attained at least a bachelor's degree in 2013. Conversely, more than 40% of Massachusetts residents had at least a bachelor's degree, the highest percentage nationwide.

Earnings vary dramatically according to a person's level of education. According to Holly Yettick, director of the Education Week Research Center, it is very clear that “people with higher levels of educational attainment make more money.” While a typical American adult with less than a high school diploma earned slightly more than $20,000 in 2013, a person with a bachelor's degree earned more than $50,000.
Varying levels of income and poverty may also help explain the considerable variations in educational attainment between states. According to Sterling Lloyd, senior research associate at the Education Week Research Center, “varying poverty levels, or differences in socioeconomic status among residents in states” are among the major contributors to disparities in educational attainment.
In fact, the median household income in nine of the 10 states with the lowest educational attainment rates was far lower than the national median of $52,250 in 2013. On the other end of the spectrum, the most educated states all had among the highest median household income in the nation.
A number of other factors contribute to a state's college attainment rate. While it is extremely difficult to measure the impact of policy on a region's level of education, Lloyd explained that policymakers expect that “efforts to increase financial assistance for students will ultimately result in higher rates of educational attainment.” State policymakers are also attempting to improve college readiness by implementing new curriculum standards and benchmarks for college readiness, Lloyd told 24/7 Wall St.
College attainment levels may also be influenced by a migration effect. Yettick pointed out that areas in Colorado, for example, have excellent college attainment rates but relatively poor high school graduation rates. This may indicate that while a state's education system may be weak, its job market may be strong, attracting people with college degrees to move to the state.
However, a state may also attract people without college degrees. Yettick mentioned Nevada in particular, which had among the lowest college attainment. According to Yettick, “there are a lot of service jobs, so a lot of people moving into [Nevada] do not have college degrees.”
Yet, strong post-secondary education systems are still very important to states. Lloyd said that higher college graduation rates will make a state “more competitive in attracting companies to locate or relocate,” which is why “you see a lot of governors pushing higher education in their state.” Lloyd further explained that with increasingly mobile infrastructure, the education level of the labor force is among the most important factors a company will consider when deciding where to move.
To identify the most and least educated states in America, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the states with the highest and lowest percentages of residents aged 25 or older with at least a bachelor's degree in 2013. 24/7 Wall St. also reviewed the percentages of adults who have completed education at each major education level, including high school, college, and graduate programs. In addition, we reviewed poverty rates and median earnings for the various levels of education, as well as statewide poverty rates and median household incomes. All data are from the U.S. Census' American Community Survey.
These are the most and least educated states in America.
Protests in the US against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's election victory have turned violent as demonstrators take to the streets for a second day.
Thousands of protesters on Thursday threw objects at police in Portland, Oregon, and damaged a car park, the Portland Police Department said on Twitter.
IN PICTURES: Violence as anti-Trump rallies sweep US cities
Some protesters sprayed graffiti on cars and buildings and destroyed shop windows, local media in Portland reported.
"Many in the crowd are trying to get anarchist groups to stop destroying property, anarchists refusing. Others encouraged to leave area," the department said on Twitter after declaring the demonstration a riot.
As thousands of people marched, some vandalised shop windows, lit firecrackers and set waste bins on fire.
An estimated 4,000 protesters chanted "We reject the president-elect!", with some throwing objects at police, prompting several arrests.
On the East Coast, protests occurred in Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, while on the West Coast demonstrators rallied in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Oakland in California besides Portland.
Dozens in Minneapolis marched on to Interstate 94, blocking traffic in both directions for at least an hour as police stood by.
A smaller band of demonstrators briefly halted traffic on a busy Los Angeles freeway before police cleared them off.
Baltimore police reported that about 600 people marched through the downtown Inner Harbor area, with some blocking roadways by sitting in the street.
Two people were arrested, police said.
In Denver, a crowd that media estimated to number about 3,000 gathered on the grounds of the Colorado state capitol and marched through downtown in one of the largest of Thursday's events.
Hundreds also demonstrated in Dallas.
Thursday's gatherings were generally smaller in scale and less intense than Wednesday's, and teenagers and young adults again dominated the racially mixed crowds.
"Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!" Trump said in on Twitter on Thursday night.
Police pitched special security barricades around two Trump marquee properties that have become focal points of the protests - their newly opened Pennsylvania Avenue Hotel in Washington DC and Trump Tower, where they live in Manhattan.
In the nation's capital, about 100 protesters marched from the White House, where Trump had their first transition meeting with President Barack Obama on Thursday, to the Trump International Hotel several blocks away.
At least 200 people rallied there after dark, many of them chanting "No hate! No fear! Immigrants are welcome here!" and carrying signs with such slogans as "Impeach Trump" and "Not my president".
Trump supporters say the protesters are not respecting the democratic process.
As of Thursday, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party candidate, was leading Trump in votes nationwide 47.7 percent to 47.5 percent, but Trump secured victory in the Electoral College.
A Glasgow tattoo artist has been slammed for putting a sign up banning “junkies”.
Senior staff at charities in the city who work with addicts say it “stigmatises” drug users.
The sign on the door of Timeless Tattoo states “Strictly…no junkies!”
The shop (above) in Dundas Street is just yards from busy Queen Street Station.
David Liddell, Chief Executive of charity Scottish Drugs Forum, described the sign as “deeply unhelpful”.
“I don't know what the shopkeeper is trying to achieve but this kind of language only helps to further alienate some of our communities' most marginalised people,” they said.
“The labels we give people can stop us seeing the human being behind that label. If we are to help people survive with a drug problem and move on to make progress in their lives we have to see the person that they are and work with them.”
John Holleran of charity Scottish Families Affected by Alcohol and Drugs said: “This message, and the stigmatising language it contains, reinforces how prevalent negative attitudes towards the recovery community are today.
“Family members tell us that it is these derogatory labels that often makes it more difficult for them to access services for themselves when supporting a loved one in recovery.”
Drug workers at charity Turning Point Scotland have offered to meet the tattoo artist and discuss “a more constructive response”.
“I think it is safe to say that the sign can be seen to reinforce the stigma a lot of people with problematic drug use face,” said Craig Winter, a director at the charity.
“Where we will continue to offer advice, support and guidance to individuals we also see building positive community responses as key to tackling the issues of problematic drug use in the city.
“For example, in this instance, I'm sure we or other health care colleagues would be more than happy to discuss with the shop owner a more constructive response to the issues they have clearly felt needed addressed by their placing of the sign.”
The shop manager, who only gave their name as ‘Steven', defended the sign.
They said: “The shop has quite a lot of trouble with drug users. A lot of people come in who are out of their face and cause disruption. Some are drunks. Some are junkies.
“The sign is not supposed to be there to single people out - we just don't want trouble in our shop. I've had people threaten me, verbally abuse me and attempt to attack me.”
They added: “We've had no complaints (about the sign). If customers complained we'd speak to them about it. It's a popular sign. A lot of people take photos of it.”
When Duke and #23 Northwestern face off against one another on Saturday afternoon, the teams may feel as if they are looking into a mirror. Both schools are known for their academic reputations (the latest in academic rankings, US News, have Duke at #8 with Northwestern at #12. Their institutions are both more known for championships in other sports (Duke, of course, for men's basketball while the Wildcat women's lacrosse team captured seven national championships from 2005-2012). Yet a quick peek at history demonstrates how similar the teams are.
1) During eras of football futility, both teams pondered moves outside of major conferences - There is a slight chance that if others had gotten their ways that Saturday's game could have been a rather meaningless contest between two Ivy League teams as opposed to a battle between two up and coming BCS teams. In the 1980s, when NU struggled mightily with football, their athletic department strongly considered moving to the Ivy League. And as late as 2010, Duke alumni and well known columnist and author John Feinstein was calling for Duke to leave the ACC in football and join a less rigorous conference.
2) The winner of Saturday's game will get a one game advantage in the overall series record (currently tied at 8-8). Northwestern has been the more dominant team of late, winning five out of the last six games, yet taking all 16 games into account, the average score is Northwestern 23.5 and Duke 22.4
3) Both teams have appeared in 11 bowl games throughout their histories, with little success at winning their final game of the year - Duke is 3-8 while NU is 2-9. They both also have had recent streaks of consecutive bowl appearances (NU appeared in five bowl games from 2007-2012 while Duke's streak is still active at three bowl games)
4) Both teams have played in the Rose Bowl twice - Duke's appearances, of course, came much earlier in the team's history, losing the 1939 game 7-3 against Southern California and then falling to Oregon State 20-16 in January of 1942 in the only Rose Bowl to be played outside of California. Northwestern won the 1948 Rose Bowl and then more recently lost the 1995 game.
5) Both teams have been lead by a mixture of recognizable names along with relative unknowns - Many people know that before finding fame at Florida, the NFL and South Carolina that Steve Spurrier began their ascension in coaching strolling the sidelines in Durham. Similarly Dennis Green, famous for their "They are who they thought they were" post-game comments as head coach of the Arizona Cardinals, spent five years in Chicago.
6) Both teams current coaches are known as much for their off field character as their on-field success: In many ways Pat Fitzgerald could be seen as a younger version of David Cutcliffe. Both men know that their jobs have involved rebuilding football programs, and while Cutcliffe had a harder road in terms of football wins and loses, Fitzgerald had the daunting task of taking over a program after the death of its head coach, Randy Walker. Both men are known for being men of character both on and off the field, ones that seem to believe that a head football coach is responsible for not only creating good football players, but also good young men. And so far, while both of them have been on the list of sought after coaches for new openings, they have turned down other jobs to stay at their current positions.
Saturday's game will add another chapter to the history of both programs. NU will have a chance to demonstrate that it's win against Stanford was a sign that the program can return to its recent success. And Duke will have an opportunity to knock off a top-25 team at home for the first time since 1994 and maybe sneak back into the national rankings.
Just one company, Underwood Ranches in Camarillo, Cali., grows the chiles used to make Sriracha. And Huy Fong Foods only buys from them. Below, workers dump hand-picked chiles into crates.
Equipment does some of the work though. This year, the farm will grow 48,000 tons of peppers, according to owner Craig Underwood
That would take up a field about the size of lower Manhattan, south of Houston Street
After sorting, a conveyer belt hoists the peppers onto trucks. The farm sends about 30 semis to Huy Fong Foods daily
Vietnamese refugee David Tran founded Huy Fong Foods, located in Rosemead, Cali
Once the chiles leave the trucks, processing starts
They look like red quicksand funneling into factory machines
First, a windmill-like device washes the chiles, removing any dirt or chemicals
Then they enter a grinder
Kind of looks like ground beef, doesn't it?
After that, industrial, blue barrels store the chile-mash
Later, the mixture gets a dose of garlic and sugar. Below, the sauce cooks while churning
Then, packaging begins. The old factory (not shown) could produce about 70,000 bottles daily. Huy Fong Foods' new facility, howe
Factory machines also take care of the the final touch, those signature green caps
Aside from the 17- and 28-ounce bottles, the company plans to sell 9-ounce and gallon-sized containers too, according to Tran
Surprisingly, the company doesn't advertise for any product. Fans, however, often pick up the slack. This dancing chicken comes
Still, Huy Fong Foods has no trouble selling the special sauce. "The past 30 years, the economics sometimes up and down. For me, I feel nothing. Every day, every month, the volume increase," Tran said.
Most importantly, Tran wants to keep the price low for their “chile friends.”
And they use it on almost everything
A professional observatory in Greece has begun recording flashes created when bits of interplanetary debris strike the Moon.
The Moon's battered face bears witness to the countless times something has slammed into the lunar surface, and new craters (albeit very small ones) form all the time. Even these mini-collisions occur at 20 km (12 miles) per second, while the very fastest are 70 km/s. If the chunk of debris has a mass of at least a few tens of grams, it creates a momentary white-hot flash — and if that occurs somewhere on the Moon's night side, it's an observable event.
We have front-row seats for these crash landings, but they're rarely seen. Over the past 20 years only a handful of lucky telescopic observers on Earth have spotted one inadvertently.
In 2005, a team from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center started routine monitoring of the lunar disk using a network of 14-inch telescopes, particularly during annual meteor showers such as the Perseids and Geminids, and it's captured hundreds of flashes to date. Other monitoring efforts are MIDAS, operating in Spain, and ILIAD in Morocco.
Recently a new player has upped the scientific stakes. Since February, European astronomers have been staring at the lunar night using the 1.2-meter Kryoneri telescope on Peloponnese in Greece.­ This project, led by the National Observatory of Athens under a contract with the European Space Agency, has developed a special observing system called NELIOTA (short for NEO Lunar Impacts and Optical Transients). The 22-month observing effort records strikes down to 12th magnitude — far fainter than other programs can achieve.
At this week's meeting of the AAS's Division for Planetary Sciences in Provo, Utah, researcher Chrysa Avdellidou (European Space Agency) reported that to date the system has captured 22 flashes. That's one impact per 1.8 hours of observing, compared to one per 2.8 hours for the NASA system.
The power of NELIOTA, apart from the telescope's large aperture, lies in using a beam-splitter to feed a 17-by-14-arcminute field of view to two high-frame-rate video cameras simultaneously. One camera records the lunar night in red light (R band, 641 nm) and the other in the near infrared (I band, 798 nm).
This combination captures longer events, lasting from 43 to 182 milliseconds, because the collision sites remain hot after the visible-light flash has faded from view. "You can watch the cooling of each impact plume," Avdellidou says.
Moreover, the two wavelengths provide a way to extract each impact's temperature and an estimate for the colliding object's mass.
But such calculations are tricky — partly because there's no way to know exactly how fast these interplanetary bullets are striking the Moon and partly because the amount of kinetic energy that goes into creating the flash (its luminous efficiency) is guesswork.
So far, the flashes have varied from 1,770 to 3,730 Kelvins, a range that fits theoretical predictions well. Avdellidou isn't convinced that these blackbody temperatures are telling the whole story, however. So they want to conduct a series of hypervelocity laboratory experiments in simulated lunar materials to see how the target's composition affects the intensity and duration of each lunar flash.
In the meantime, she's using mapping data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to try to determine the composition of each impact site. This spacecraft is also very good at spotting fresh impacts on the Moon. So, with luck, LRO scientists can use NELIOTA's high-quality images to track down where some of the larger strikes have occurred — the "smoking gun" that would provide crucial links between an impactor's kinetic energy and the brightness of its flash.
French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to their US counterpart Donald Trump and other world leaders about the situation in the Middle East after meeting Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri at the Elysée palace on Saturday. After Iran reacted angrily to Macron dubbing its policy in the region "aggressive", the Elysée insisted there had been no break in contact between Paris and Tehran.
Macron discussed "ways to stabilise the region and establish peace" in phone calls to Trump, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, a presidential statement said Saturday.
The White House announced that Trump and Macron "agreed on the need to work with allies to counter Hezbullah's and Iran's destabilising activities in the region”.
Hariri, a joint Saudi-Lebanese national who slammed Iran and Hezbullah when they announced their resignation in Riyadh on 4 November, did not confirm their resignation in their meeting with Macron, the Elysée said, adding that this was not "anomalous", given that they said they would be returning to Lebanon in the next few days.
Nor was there cause for concern that two of Hariri's children remained in Saudi Arabia, according to the French presidency. "They left them there because they felt it was desirable," the statement said.
Dialogue with Iran
Iranian officials twice this week slammed Macron for criticising the country's "aggressive" policy in the region and its "uncontrolled" ballistic programme, in termes reminiscent of Saudi, Israeli and US statements.
The Elysée statement insisted that "We speak freely to Iran" and that there had been "no interruption" in contacts with the country, with which a "firm and demanding dialogue" must be had.
Macron has announced that they intend to visit Iran next year.
France hopes to organise a meeting in Paris of the international Lebanon support group, which is made up of the members of the UN Security Council - the US, France, the UK, China and Russia - the European Union, Italy, Germany and the Arab League.
The presidency is also "closely following" the case of 250 French nationals who say they are owned nearly 20 million euros in back pay and benefits by Saudi Oger, a construction company of which Hariri is the majority shareholder.
The Saudis have promised to pay the money owing, the statement said.

Bitcoin wallet is the equivalent of a physical wallet for transactions with Bitcoin. There are different wallets for different platforms. To start working with bitcoins (Bitcoin), first of all you will need a bitcoin wallet. It allows you to make transactions, that is, buy and sell cryptocurrency. The main task of bitcoin wallet is to store the secret key that is needed to access the bitcoin address and, accordingly, your funds. From a technical point of view, bitcoins themselves are not stored anywhere, only secret digital keys are stored, which give access to public bitcoin addresses and the ability to "sign" transactions. It is for this information and need a bitcoin wallet. Wallets are different, depending on the device for which they are intended — you can even do not use the computer and write the keys on paper. And, of course, it is very important that the wallet has a backup copy and was protected from unauthorized access. [1]
Cryptocurrency wallets are digital and physical, offline and online methods that rely on public key cryptography [2] to allow users to send and receive bitcoins securely across the network.
What is a Bitcoin wallet? [ edit ]
Web Crypto wallets use public key cryptography to make transactions secure. Public key cryptography is a system in which a piece of data is encrypted with a public key, and can only be decrypted using the public key's matching private key. [3]
A Bitcoin wallet can be a software, hardware, online web service, or piece of paper, that works by generating the public-key-and-private-key pair necessary for users to engage in a transaction, i.e. to transfer value between Bitcoin wallets and include this information in the blockchain.[4] The public key – also called an address – and the private key – also called the seed – are large integer numbers usually represented using a separate Wallet Import Format (WIF) consisting of letters and numbers.[5] Each public key should only be used once. While the address is public, the private key should only ever be seen by the owner of the wallet and never shared with other people.
When a user wishes to send bitcoins, their private key is combined with the transaction request (which includes the receiver's public address) to encrypt or digitally "sign" it.[6] The digital signature produced is important because it provides the nodes in the network with the mathematical proof they use to verify the authenticity of the source and check that the sender actually has the right amount of bitcoins to spend. In the blockchain, all bitcoins are registered to an address, or public key.
The main functions [ edit ]
Crypto wallet review
Bitcoinwallets provide the following functionality:
storage of Bitcoin addresses and corresponding closed/open keys on users computer in wallet.dat file,
conduction transactions of obtaining and transferring Bitcoins (BTC), also without connection to internet
providing information about the balance in BTC at all available addresses, prior transactions, spare keys.
The original Bitcoin client stores private key information in a file named wallet.dat following the so called bitkeys format.
It contains:
keypairs for each of your addresses
transactions done from/to your addresses
user preferences
default key
reserve keys
accounts
a version number
Key pool
Since 0.3.21: information about the current best chain, to be able to rescan automatically when restoring from a backup.
The wallet.dat file is located in the Bitcoin data directory and may be encrypted with a password.
It is intended that a wallet file be used on only one installation of Bitcoin at a time. Attempting to clone a wallet file for use on multiple computers will result in weird behavior. [7]
The format of this file is Berkeley DB. Tools that can manipulate wallet files include pywallet.
Types of Bitcoin (BTC) wallets [ edit ]
Wallets can be classified according to whether they are physical or digital, or according to whether they are online or offline. Hardware Bitcoin wallets and paper wallets are physical. Digital wallets can be mobile or desktop software, or web services. All these wallets are either by default, or could potentially at some point be, online. A hardware and paper Bitcoin wallets are meant to be used offline (cold storage). However, one could connect a hardware wallet to, or print a paper wallet from, a computer that was online. Doing this is counter-recommended since it would void the whole purpose of these wallets. A software wallet may be used online or offline. Web wallets are always online. For EZ Flash IV convenience system provides three types of Bitcoinwallets: desktop, online and mobile.
Desktop wallets [ edit ]
Desktop wallets are installed on your computer and provide complete control of the currency and budget safety.
Thick wallets [ edit ]

Armory (Linux, Windows). Functions over Bitcoin-Qt app, expanding its opportunities. Managing several Bitcoinwallet, storing them in offline, protecting from hacker attacks, creating messages and signing them with closed key.[8]
Thin wallets [ edit ]
No need to download blocks, easy to install on the tablet/cell phone, third-party resource leads checking operations.
Multibit (Windows, macOS, Linux). App for beginners, Russian language included. Multibit is a multi coin wallet.
Electrum (Windows, macOS, Android, Linux). Generation of 6 addresses that can be restored through Electrum.
Custodial Bitcoin wallet [ edit ]
Custodial (or hosted) wallet is very similar in its functions to online bank applications. Unlike other wallets which keep users responsible for security, custodials provide backup and guarantee access to the wallet in complex situations (e.g. when user loses phone or forgets mnemonic phrase). Custodial wallets usually support enhanced security measures such as 2FA and Multisignature. Some of them (Coinbase, Freewallet) provide instant commission free transactions between wallet's users and support SegWit. On the other hand just as in bank, users have no direct access to their funds and tell the custodial to make transactions on their behalf. The funds are not fully secured of being seized by a court decision as well as targeted hacking activities or scam.
Freewallet is a family of custodial wallets working on iOS, Android and Web. Freewallet Multicurrency wallet operates 30+ currencies, although there are stand-alone wallets for different currencies. Freewallet has been recently listed as the third biggest online wallet for Android.
A digital currency exchange headquartered in San Francisco, California. Coinbase broker exchanges of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other digital assets with fiat currencies in 32 countries, and bitcoin transactions and storage in 190 countries worldwide.
First mobile client for iOS and Android, designed for smartphones and tablets. Client connects to the Bitcoin network directly which eliminates the possibility of losing any confidential data. BTC.com wallet operates Bitcoins only.
Accepts over 450 different altcoins (including ERC20) and operates worldwide. The CoinPayments wallet is completely free for non-commercial applications. Merchants using the checkout system and API's are charged a small 0.50% fee on incoming transactions which is deducted during payment.

Ledger Wallet manufactures various crypto hardware wallets.
Multibit HD (the current version) uses a BIP 0032 (type 2) Deterministic wallet with the format described here. The Classic version used the bitcoinj protobuf wallet file.
Blocktrail offers a BIP 0032 (type 2) Deterministic wallet and for added security also implements multi-signature wallet technology.
TREZOR is an isolated hardware environment for offline transaction signing and using a small display you can visually verify the transaction contents.TREZOR is a cryptocurrency cold wallet
OpenCoiner [ edit ]
OpenCoiner is a fast and lightweight open source web based wallet
NFC Wallet Card [ edit ]
NFC Wallet Card is a cold storage hardware wallet for any kind of cryptocurrencies.
Paper Bitcoin wallet [ edit ]
Paper Bitcoin wallet is a document containing all of the data necessary to generate any number of Bitcoin private keys, forming a wallet of keys. However, people often use the term to mean any way of storing bitcoins offline as a physical document. People are able to create paper wallet by themselves using printers and bitcoin address generators.
Safest Bitcoin wallet [ edit ]
A user's choice of wallet will depend on what the user wants to do with their bitcoin.
What is the best Bitcoin wallet? [ edit ]
It is difficult to propose the safest and best Bitcoin wallet as there are wallets for different goals. For saving larger amounts, Bitcoin hardware wallets may be a better option, if the user can afford it. Software wallets on the other hand are free, and may be more convenient for frequent transactions and handling smaller quantities.
Users may also use a combination of wallets. The website weusecoins.com recommends using a mobile wallet as a checking account and a hardware or secure offline wallet as a savings account.
BTC Wallet Security [ edit ]
There is no safest cryptocurrency wallet, but to ensure safety of Bitcoin wallet it is necessary to do the following measures:
The Wallet encryption. You can encrypt with a strong password is difficult to hack, but it does not give absolute protection. If your computer is infected with a keystroke recording virus, your password may become known to an attacker.
Back up. It is Important to back up the entire wallet. The fact is that some addresses are used to store changes in transactions and may not be visible to the user. So you need to back up your entire wallet in several places.
Multipoles In recent years an increasing number of services that support transactions with multiple signatures. This approach allows several users to partially sign one address with a public key, and if someone wants to spend bitcoins, it is necessary that in addition to signing it, the transaction is signed by several more users. How many signatures is necessary, is established in advance, at creation of the address. This form of signature may be useful in the case of mutual agreement between, for example, business partners or family members. The second device belonging to the same user can also be the second participant.

The mobile world has been buzzing about 5G in recent months, with Verizon (NYSE: VZ) saying earlier this year it plans to begin launching commercial services as early as next year. But it's increasingly apparent that U.S. consumers won't have access to truly mobile 5G offerings for at least a few more years.
"The millimeter wave – 28 GHz in particular, the spectrum that certain operators have – is certified by the FCC only for fixed today, so until the FCC comes out with rules for mobile, we can't even use that for mobile," said Krish Prabhu, AT&T's CTO and president of AT&T Labs, during an interview at Cowen and Company's Technology, Media & Telecom Conference Thursday. "But I think you're right – most of what we'll see over the next two, three years is fixed applications."
While 5G standards are a very long way from being finalized, high-band spectrum is expected to be a key component because it provides increased capacity. Because high-band airwaves don't propagate as well, though, operators are actively looking to small cells to densify their networks in advance of 5G.
Verizon reported in February that its early 5G tests topped 10 Gbps and delivered 4K video while moving, adding that it was on track to launch commercially next year. But the carrier was criticized in some circles for hyping the technology – T-Mobile (NYSE:TMUS) executives said its prediction was "BS" – and Verizon CFO Fran Shammo later clarified that an initial pilot starting in 2017 is "really not about mobile, it's really around fixed wireless."
Previous wireless network generations have primarily referred to mobile use, of course, and it's unclear whether fixed-line services will be branded as 5G. But Prabhu said AT&T (NYSE: T) will begin tests later this year that will include a mobile component.
"This is a 5G millimeter wave trial, so we are going to start with 15 GHz in the summer here in a few months then go to 28 GHz at the end of the year," they explained. "It will largely be a fixed wireless service with some limited mobility."
Meanwhile, AT&T – like all of its competitors – is shifting its focus from traditional towers to small cells to boost capacity and fill gaps in its network. Prabhu said the carrier's macrosite network is roughly 90 percent of the size it will be in five years, while its small-cell buildout is only 5 to 10 percent of where they expect it to be by then.
"As we go to enhance mobile with more bandwidth to the device, the small cells really (become) a key to the new architecture," they said. "We are looking at it pretty aggressively. It depends on which markets and whether the small cells make sense (in those markets)."

Since the announcement and revocation of Microsoft's "Family Sharing" features on Xbox One, we've been waiting for someone to come up with a fair and logical way of sharing generalized gameplay experiences with friends over the Internet. Steam's library-wide Family Sharing features were a step in the right direction, but Sony's newly announced Share Play feature sounds like the Internet game sharing we've been waiting for.
Announced at Sony's pre-Gamescom press conference today, Share Play is being sold as a "virtual couch" that lets you in effect "pass the controller" to friends online even if they don't own a copy of the game. That means you'll be able to play simultaneous cooperative and competitive games with your PSN friends, even if the game is only designed for local multiplayer. Alternatively, an online friend can take over for you in single-player games to help with a particularly difficult section.
It all happens without the need for the second online player to buy or download anything, Sony said, although both players will need to have a PlayStation Plus account. While Sony didn't get technical at the press event, it seems the feature works through the same kind of Gaikai-fueled game-streaming/screen-sharing technology that powers PlayStation Now and PS4 Remote Play on the Vita.
While a lot will depend on the implementation, this is the kind of no-brainer, value-added feature that seems like a good, innovative use of what's becoming near-ubiquitous broadband connections in many parts of the world. By designing a game-sharing system that works with any game—and without any onerous purchasing or download requirements—Sony is letting players easily reconnect with friends that may live too far away to come over for a quick gaming session but who still want to play together with their buddies as if they were in the same room.
The new feature will come to the PlayStation 4 via the System Software 2.0 update, which is being targeted for release "this fall." That update will also add the ability to share recorded game clips directly to a YouTube channel and a new "friend finder" that helpfully suggests people you might know on the PlayStation Network.
Elsewhere in its pre-Gamescom press conference, Sony announced that its PlayStation Now game streaming service wouldn't launch in Europe until 2015, owing to a stated desire to make sure the experience was up to standard in every locale. Sony also announced that its PlayStation TV micro-console would come to Europe on November 14 at a price of €99, which includes three digital game downloads.
On top of Share Play, Sony's conference was packed with a number of new trailers, including Q Games' newly announced crafting-shooter The Tomorrow Children, previously announced exploration title Rime, animal-filled adventure game Wild, and Supergiant's mysterious horror game Until Dawn, which was first announced at Gamescom two years ago. The PlayStation 4 will also be getting new versions of titles like Tearaway, DayZ, and a number of indie games that are making their way over from the PC.
Perhaps tellingly, Sony didn't mention the struggling PlayStation Vita, or any games for it, a single time during the otherwise wide-ranging press conference.
One of the most perplexing questions on the minds of young Americans today is whether college is worth the associated tuition cost. It is rather humbling to see that $1.4 trillion in student debt is outstanding today. That is more than auto debt and credit card debt. College tuition has outpaced virtually every category that is tracked in our inflation measures. It has out run housing prices. It has left healthcare in the dust. It has crushed wages which are stagnant for nearly a generation. The last item is probably the most important measure to examine. If college is worth it, why have wages gone stagnant all the while tuition prices continue to go up? Is it because of federal loans? Is it because of mega complexes being built? Or is there something else going on?
The $1.4 trillion question
College tuition wasn't always so out of control. There seems to be a “price growth through debt” phenomenon going on here. We've seen it with housing and also automobile costs. The financing of the system via Wall Street and big banks has caused a runaway inflation in base prices. As wild as housing and auto prices have gone, they simply pale in comparison to college tuition.
First take a look at the total student debt in the United States:

$1.4 trillion in student debt is outstanding. And this figure continues to grow at a breathtaking speed. It might be useful to lay out some facts on both sides of the equation.
Pro 1: College graduates do make more than high school graduates. That is simply the reality. Con 1: Student debt outstanding is ridiculous. The average graduate in 2011 came out with $26,600 in debt and that number has only gone up since then. Pro 2: Many jobs do require college degrees. So many may have to go to school to work in certain fields. Con 2: Student debt has forced many to live with parents and put off buying a home or even getting married. Pro 3: There are more opportunities for college graduates. In this tough employment market, that may make the difference between working and being part of the large non-working labor force. Con 3: Many college graduates are working in fields that don't require their degree. In fact, the estimate by the Department of Labor is that 17 million Americans with college degrees are working in fields where their degrees are not needed.
Hera is a few more stats on recent college graduates:
There is a big problem in the higher education market. There is little doubt about that. Student loan debt is moving at an unsustainable pace. For example, student debt has grown by more than $1 trillion in the last decade alone and has surpassed auto debt by a wide margin:
It should be noted that there are over 5,000 colleges and universities in the United States. Not all of the schools are created equal. It should also be noted that not all majors are created equal:
Science and Math pays. Another major factor is how well you do and your ability to network. How good is the career center in the school you are at? Is the market healthy? These are hard questions for most let alone an 18 year old that now has the capability to borrow $50,000 a year for a degree that may not be worth it. What is even more frightening is that college debt cannot be discharged through bankruptcy. This is one loophole that needs to be closed.
In the end, there are clear pros and cons on both sides. The unsustainable trajectory of the $1.4 trillion in debt and lower outcomes is going to see a revolution in higher education over the next decade.

Today we're very excited to announce the latest in Tablo hardware: Tablo OTA Drone.
Tablo OTA Drone combines the latest in omni-directional Over-the-Air HDTV antenna technology with a powerful quadricopter drone to provide your home with unparalleled broadcast TV reception.
Using GPS positioning and advanced automated stability controls, Tablo OTA Drone (starting at $999 US) will hover over your home, providing its integrated TV antenna with direct line-of-sight to local broadcast towers. The crystal clear, high definition digital television signals will then be beamed directly to your Tablo OTA DVR via a proprietary CoaxCast streaming connection.
Tablo OTA Drone can remain airborne for up to 18 hours with onboard solar cells, but it has been programmed to descend and recharge on a rooftop or balcony-secured charging station when tuners are not in use or when accessing broadcast towers within a 25-mile (40 KM) range that do not require additional height for optimal reception. A notification within the iOS or Android control app will let you know when maintenance is required.
Tablo Drone will be available in the ‘Fall-ish' timeframe. Stay tuned for more details!
If you're not yet sure if Over-the-Air HDTV TV is for you, Tablo will also be deploying a fleet of Tablo OTA Drones in major cities across the United States and Canada to help you discover which broadcast channels are available at your home. To find out what channels you can receive, click to enter your zip or postal code to deploy a Tablo OTA Drone.
Happy April Fools' Day Tablo fans! If you really want this awesome drone, the lovely folks at Parrot sell it (without OTA antenna of course).
Then, as caucusgoers were ferried into the Staten Island Room to cast their votes, they were met by even more Clinton supporters, making sure they had everything they needed to complete the complicated caucus process.
“This is my first caucus; I'm going to learn right here today because this is very important to me,” said Tanya Miller, a 22-year veteran of the nearby MGM Casino, as they picked out a blue Clinton shirt to fit over the gray and gold pantsuit they wear in their job in the executive offices.
More than three hours later, they marched out victorious, 196 strong, swinging the “I'm With Her” royal blue shirts over their heads, waving American flags and chanting “Hillary! Hillary!” as they made their way out, many heading back to work.
At the New York-New York casino precinct, one of six locations scattered along the casino strip that were open to shift workers, the excitement for Ms. Clinton was clear from the start. As the room swelled with caucus-goers, the turnout was overwhelmingly in their favor.
Even the rare undecided voters broke for Mrs. Clinton, after being wooed by both sides with chants, cheers and the occasional scream.
