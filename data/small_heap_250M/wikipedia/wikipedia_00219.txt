Steven Plaut (1951 – January 17, 2017) was an Israeli economist, academic and writer. He was an associate professor of Business Administration at the University of Haifa as well as a member of the editorial board of the Middle East Quarterly, a publication of the Middle East Forum think tank.
Biography
Steven Plaut was born in Philadelphia. In 1981, Plaut immigrated to Israel with his family. He died on January 17, 2017, in Haifa, Israel at the age of 65 after battling cancer for many years.
Academic career
Plaut received his undergraduate degree from Temple University in Philadelphia and his MA from Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He received a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University, specializing in international and urban economics and later in finance. Plaut worked at the Federal Reserve Bank. Before his professorship at the Haifa University, he taught at Oberlin College, the Technion, UC Berkeley, UC Irvine, Central European University, Tel Aviv University, University of Nantes, and Athens Laboratory for Business Administration.
Literary career
In his 1985 book titled The Joy of Capitalism, Plaut argues for free market economics and compares the profit motive to the libido. In the book he discusses energy, housing, banking and agricultural policy as well as equality and income distribution.
In his 2002 book The Scout Steven Plaut describes his near-death experience as a kidney cancer patient at an intensive care ward. The historical novel is a series of life stories exchanged between him and another patient in the ward, an Israeli Bedouin scout.
Political views
Plaut was an outspoken critic of the Israeli-Arab peace process and Israel's unilateral withdrawal policy. Since the Oslo Accords, he argued that Arab leaders would continue to seek the destruction of Israel through violence and terrorism. Some of his political writings are criticisms of Nakba Day.
Plaut was critical of many Israeli left-wing figures, as well as some Americans such as Michael Lerner and Norman Finkelstein, whom he described as self-hating Jews and apologists for terrorism that are promoting the destruction of Israel. Plaut was opposed to what he saw as left-wing extremism in Israeli universities, and was actively involved in Isracampus, a self-proclaimed watchdog organization that publicizes anti-Israel people and groups. In the Canadian Jewish Tribune, he denounced Anarchists Against the Wall, a group protesting the Israeli West Bank barrier which he said was composed of "violent hooligans and anarcho-fascist thugs."
Libel case
Plaut was sued for libel by Neve Gordon, a faculty member at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Department of Politics and Government, claiming that Plaut slandered him in certain articles and alleged e-mails. In May 2006, the Nazareth Magistrate's Court ruled in favor of Gordon, and ordered Plaut to pay Gordon 80,000 shekels in compensation plus 15,000 shekels in legal fees. Both sides appealed to the Nazareth District Court, and in February 2008, the court reversed three out of four of the libel claims but upheld a libel judgment relating to the fourth, a publication in which Plaut called Gordon a "Judenrat Wannabe". It reduced the damages to 10,000 shekels (about $2,700) on the basis that, in the court's view, Plaut was entitled to criticize Gordon.
Letter to Turkish Prime Minister
In March 2013, a letter from Plaut was received by the office of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime Minister of Turkey. The letter condemned as illegal Turkey's occupation of Northern Cyprus and attacked the Turkish Prime Minister, accusing him of being behind the Gaza Flotilla "terrorist attack" on Israeli soldiers. Plaut apologized for Israel not killing a larger number of "terrorists" on the flotilla ship. He claimed it was time to give back "occupied Constantinople" to its "true owner", namely, Greece.

Early County is a county located on the southwest border of the U.S. state of Georgia. As of the 2010 census, the population was 11,008. The county seat is Blakely, where the Early County Courthouse is located. Created on December 15, 1818, it was named for Peter Early, 28th Governor of Georgia. The county is bordered on the west by the Chattahoochee River, forming the border with Alabama.
History
Prehistoric and nineteenth-century history has been preserved in some of Early County's attractions. It is the site of the Kolomoki Mounds, a park preserving major earthworks built by indigenous peoples of the Woodland culture more than 1700 years ago, from 350 CE to 600 CE. This is one of the largest mound complexes in the United States and the largest in Georgia; it includes burial and ceremonial mounds. The siting of the mounds expresses the ancient people's cosmology, as mounds are aligned with the sun at the spring equinox and summer solstice.
The county area was long territory of the historic Creek Indian peoples of the Southeast, particularly along the Chattahoochee River. Beginning in the early nineteenth century, European-American settlers began to encroach on this territory, pushing the Muscogee out during Indian Removal in the 1830s. The Muscogee were forced to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.
This area was developed by European-American settlers and their African-American enslaved workers for cotton plantations. Agriculture was critical to the economy into the 20th century. The Cohelee Creek Bridge in the county is the southernmost covered bridge still standing. One of the last wooden flagpoles from the American Civil War era is located at the historic courthouse in downtown Blakely.
According to the Equal Justice Initiative, in the period from 1877 to 1950, Early County had 24 documented lynchings of African Americans, the second-highest total in the state after the more densely populated Fulton County. Most were committed around the turn of the 20th century, in the period of Jim Crow conditions and suppression of black voting. This was still a largely agricultural area, and some disputes arose from confrontations between black sharecroppers or tenant farmers and white landowners, particularly at times to settle accounts. Another, Sidney Grist, was lynched on December 31, 1896, for "political activity".
Among these cases were five African-American men lynched by whites in less than a month in the summer of 1899: three on July 23, one on July 25 (all reportedly for rape and robbery), and one on August 3 for attempted rape. Black men were frequently identified as suspects in such cases and lynched before any trial took place; further investigations have sometimes revealed consensual sex or other persons having committed the crime. A mass lynching took place in the county on December 30, 1915, when seven black men were lynched, allegedly as suspects in a murder.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (0.7%) is water.
The northeastern and eastern portions of Early County, east of Blakely, and extending south to a line east of Jakin, are located in the Spring Creek sub-basin of the ACF River Basin (Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin). The western portion of the county is located in the Lower Chattahoochee River sub-basin of the same ACF River Basin.

Francesco Venturini (c. 1675 - April 18, 1745, Hanover) was a Baroque musician and composer of unclear origin, despite his Italian-sounding name. There is some evidence suggesting that he originated from present-day Belgium because his sons are recorded in the baptismal register as "Bruxellensis" (= from Brussels).
In 1698 Francesco Venturini became a violinist in the court chapel of Electorate of Hanover, where he had married the previous year. In 1714, Venturini was named Kapellmeister, head of the court orchestra, in Hanover. He held this post until his death.
Venturini was a renowned composer in his time. He created chamber music, concerts and other works essentially in the suite form. His Concertos Op. 1 were printed 1715 by Estienne Roger in Amsterdam and are his only known published works.

Dolno Količani () is a village in the municipality of Studeničani, North Macedonia.
History
During the great migration movements in Macedonia at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries, Macedonian Muslims left the Debar area for the central regions of Macedonia and established villages such as Dolno Količani located in the Skopje area. Although there are beliefs that they are Ottoman Turks who stayed behind when Ottomans left the Balkans.
DemographicsDolno Količani has traditionally been inhabited by a Turkish population, inhabitants there are considering them self as Ethnical Turks. The mother tongue of Dolno Količani inhabitants and of daily communication is Macedonian and Turkish for the oldest residents and the younger population.
The oldest living people in the village are witnessing and telling that previously under the Bulgarian fascist occupation, the fascist army came to the village and forced them not to talk on their native language which is Turkish language in that time, and they punished everyone who did spoke Turkish language.
According to the 2002 census, the village had a total of 1510 inhabitants. Ethnic groups in the village include:
Turks 1507
Albanians 1
Macedonians 1
Others 1

Two human polls comprised the 1961 NCAA University Division football rankings. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.
Legend
AP Poll
The final AP Poll was released on December 5, at the end of the 1961 regular season, weeks before the bowls. Starting in the 1961 season and until the 1967 season, The AP Poll ranked only 10 teams.
Final Coaches' poll
The final UPI Coaches Poll was released prior to the bowl games, on December 5.
Alabama received 18 of the 35 first-place votes; Ohio State received fifteen, Ole Miss one, and Colorado one.

Oldfieldthomasia is an extinct genus of Notoungulate, probably related to the suborder Typotheria. It lived during the Middle Eocene, in what is today South America.
Description
This animal was approximately the size of a marmot, and probably superficially resembled a rodent. The 10 centimeters long skull was rather low and had an elongated muzzle ; the orbits, of large dimension, were posteriorly opened and located in the posterior area of the skull. The zygomatic apophysis was rather slender.
The posterior part of Oldfieldthomasia debilitata was closely studied by George Gaylord Simpson in 1936, through the realization of 55 very thin sections ; the study highlighted numerous cranial characteristics, such as the relationships between the various cavities. The tympanic and hypotympanic cavities were not separated and were devoid of spongy tissue ; the path of the pneumatic orifice can be followed between the epitympanic recess and the epitympanic sinus, filling free, and close to the size of tympanic cavity. The main sinuses of the veins and arteries were also visible : the carotid entered the tympanic cavity. As in all notoungulates, the cavity for the hyoid apophysis was quite large. The posterior jugular foramen and the median jugular foramen were notably external ; the external portion of the first constituted the posterior carotid foramen.
The mandible was long and thin. The teeth formed a continuous and progressive series, with a complete series of 22 low-crowned (brachydont) teeth, both in the maxilla and the mandible. The canines were incisor-shaped. The protocone and the hypocone were almost identical, with an oblique and elongated central dimple and a posterior dimple stopped by a sort of hook fused to the ectoloph. An anterior and a posterior cingulum were present ; the molars had a mesostyle, while the premolars were triangular, with a fold on the metacone.
Classification
The genus Oldfieldthomasia was first described in 1901 by Florentino Ameghino, based on fossil remains found in terrains from the Middle Eocene of Argentina. Ameghino described several species, such as Oldfieldthomasia anfractuosa, O. debilitata, O. parvidens and O. traversa, but it may be possible that some of these forms represents intraspecific variations within a single species.
Oldfieldthomasia is the eponymous genus of the family Oldfieldthomasiidae, a group of archaic notoungulates representative of the Eocene ; this family, however, is considered paraphyletic by some researchers. Oldfieldthomasia may have been part of an early evolutionary radiation of the suborder Typotheria, a group of notoungulates who occupied during the Cenozoic various ecological niches comparable to those of rodents in other continents. Its closes relatives were Allalmeia, Colbertia and Dolichostylodon.

Anastasio Alberto Ballestrero (3 October 1913 – 21 June 1998) - in religious Anastasio del Santissimo Rosario - was an Italian Roman Catholic cardinal and professed member from the Discalced Carmelites who served as the Archbishop of Turin from 1977 until his resignation in 1989. Ballestrero was elevated to the cardinalate in 1979 and became a leading progressive voice in the Italian episcopate during his time as the head of the Italian Episcopal Conference in the pontificate of the conservative Pope John Paul II. Ballestrero likewise was known for being reserved when it came to the Shroud of Turin as opposed to the enthusiasm of John Paul II for the relic. The cardinal allowed for testing of the shroud and announced that the relic itself was a product of the Middle Ages as opposed to the genuine burial cloth of Jesus Christ.
The beatification process was launched in Turin and he became titled as a Servant of God. The diocesan process for the cause opened in late 2014 and started the collection of testimonies and documents from both Turin and Bari.
Life
Childhood and education
Alberto Alberto Ballestrero was born in Genoa on 3 October 1913 as the first of five children born to Giacomo Ballestrero and Antonietta Daffunchio. He was baptized on 2 November 1913 in the Santa Zita parish with the name "Alberto". His father worked in a Genoese port while his mother oversaw her children's religious formation. Two siblings died in the first few months of their lives. His mother died in 1923 after the birth of her final child in late 1922.
Ballestrero attended a school in Genoa from 1919 to 1922. He was enrolled at the Collegio Belimbau in 1922 before he received his Confirmation in the San Martino di Albaro church on 3 May 1923; he made his First Communion the next month on 21 June. He left the Collegio Belimbau in 1923 in order to pursue ecclesial studies to become a priest.
Profession and priesthood
On 2 October 1924 he commenced his ecclesial studies under the direction of the Discalced Carmelites in Varazze. Ballestrero then joined that religious order in Savona and took both the habit on 12 October 1928 and the name Anastasio del Santissimo Rosario. He made his initial profession on 17 October 1929. He was later transferred to the Genoese convent of Santa Anna in September 1932 for his philosophical and theological studies. But in 1932 he suffered from a life-threatening infection (and recovered in hospital from October to December 1932) before he made his solemn profession on 5 October 1934.
He received the subdiaconate and then the diaconate in 1935 before he received his solemn ordination to the priesthood in the San Lorenzo Cathedral on 6 June 1936 but required a special dispensation for it due to the age requirement. He began teaching philosophical studies at the "studentato" of Genoa-S. Anna from 13 August 1936 and initiated a preaching apostolate in a Genoese hospital (the "Bertani") from 1 January 1937. In the late 1930s he was in Paris for further studies. Ballestrero was prior of the Santa Anna convent from 22 April 1945 to 1948 and was again elected as prior on 7 May 1954 after becoming the provincial for the Ligurian province of the order on 3 April 1948. Before attending the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965 he was twice elected as the general provost for the order on 9 April 1955 and later on 21 April 1961; he remained in that position until 20 May 1967. Ballestrero visited all 350 Carmelite convents and 850 Carmelite monasteries in the world except in Hungary which refused him entrance into the nation. He once served as President of the Union of Superior Generals. During the Second Vatican Council he became friends with Henri de Lubac and was considered a close collaborator to the pope.
Episcopate and cardinalate
On 21 December 1973 he was appointed as the Archbishop of Bari. He received his episcopal consecration on in the Santa Teresa church 2 February 1974 in Rome from Cardinal Sebastiano Baggio with Bishops Michele Mincuzzi and Enrico Romolo Compagnone serving as the co-consecrators. Pope Paul VI later named him as the Archbishop of Turin on 1 August 1977; he was enthroned in his new see on the following 25 September. He was later being elected as the Vice-President for the Italian Episcopal Conference on 25 May 1978 and then served as its President from 18 May 1979 to 3 July 1985. In 1975 he preached the Spiritual Exercises to Paul VI and the Roman Curia at the pope's invitation.
Pope John Paul II elevated him into the cardinalate and named him as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria sopra Minerva on 30 June 1979. Ballestrero resigned as the Archbishop of Turin on 31 January 1989 and retired to the Santa Croce convent in La Spezia (though he would still continue to give spiritual retreats); he lost the right to vote in a papal conclave on 3 October 1993 after he turned 80.
Ballestrero attended the various episcopal gatherings that the pope called and he was also appointed as a special papal representative to the inaugural ceremonies of the Theresian Year that commemorated the fourth centennial of the death of Saint Teresa of Avila which was from 14 October until 15 October 1981 in both Alba de Tormes and Ávila. He was a noted theologian and was the author of a range of books of mediations and on Saint John of the Cross.
He became known for his progressive beliefs and he rejected some of the popular Catholic movements such as Communion and Liberation. John Paul II reproached him for this to which he was said to have replied: "Holiness, when you get to know them better, you won't like them either!"
Death
Ballestrero died at his residence in La Spezia at 3:00pm on 21 June 1998 due to a long illness. His funeral was celebrated on 25 June. He is buried in the San Giuseppe del Deserto church attached to the same Carmelite convent in Varazze that he had entered in 1924.
Beatification process
The Piedmont Bishops announced the intention - in an announcement on 4 February 2014 - that they would seek to initiate the cause for Ballestrero's potential beatification following a unanimous vote on the matter. The first move to launch the cause was to transfer the forum for the diocesan investigation from La Spezia (where the cardinal died) to Turin. The diocesan process was launched on 9 October 2014 in a Mass that Cesare Nosiglia presided over. Thus far there have been over 30 testimonies collected and as of 2015 there were 25 being sought from Bari.
The postulator for this cause is the Discalced Carmelite priest Romano Gambalunga.
Positions
Abortion
In reference to abortion the cardinal once declared that the Church must "never renounce its mission of evangelization and education of the human conscience".
Shroud of Turin
He placed the Shroud of Turin - in 1978 - on exhibit for the first time in four decades. One of those pilgrims who visited the shroud during this exhibit would be the future Pope John Paul II, who visited just six weeks prior to his election. Ballestrero would later host the pope in Turin in 1980 with the pope coming to venerate the relic.
Ballestrero agreed to scientific testing being performed on the Shroud of Turin in October 1978 but refused to permit radiocarbon dating testing as it required removing samples from the shroud itself. Once technical improvements made it possible to use samples the size of postage stamps the cardinal permitted samples to be cut in April 1988 which he himself supervised to ensure it was carried out in an appropriate manner. These would be tested in three labs in Switzerland as well as in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Following the radiocarbon dating tests the cardinal announced on 13 October 1988 that the shroud was dated from the Middle Ages and thus not the actual burial cloth of Christ (he said the findings were 95% accurate); although these tests were later believed to be invalid due to erroneous sampling.
In November 1983 the pope named him as the first pontifical custodian for the shroud which opened rumors that the relic might be transferred to Rome; the pope was enthusiastic about the shroud but Ballestrero was more reserved about the shroud.

When Rune goes to visit him for a routine tape collection and finds him dead, the police suspect a robbery.

This conviction draws her into a dangerous adventure against those who will stop at nothing to hide the truth and don't believe in Hollywood endings.

Student Hidjo (Perfected spelling Student Hijo, both meaning Student Green) is a 1918 novel by Marco Kartodikromo. Originally published as a serial in the newspaper Sinar Hindia, it was republished in book form in 1919 by Masman & Stroink.
Written while Kartodikromo was in prison, Student Hidjo tells the story of Hidjo, a Javanese student sent to the Netherlands to study but eventually falls for a Dutchwoman. An intersecting plotline, which unfolds parallel to the main story, follows Dutch administrator Willem Walter in his romantic life. Written in Malay, the novel was one of several by Javanese authors which helped popularise the word "saya" as a first-person personal pronoun.
Described by Kartodikromo as an extended simile, Student Hidjo has been noted as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets. Traditional Javanese and Dutch cultural values are contrasted; from this contrast, Kartodikromo advocates a view that the two are incompatible. This includes love, which is described in the novel as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find; the traditional view being that marriage is to be used for social mobility.
Background
Student Hidjo was written by Marco Kartodikromo, a journalist from Blora who began his career in Bandung and was strongly opposed to the policies of the Dutch East Indies government. For several years he worked as an editor at the Surakarta-based newspaper Doenia Bergerak; the city later served as the novel's setting. He spent five months in the Netherlands, from late 1916 to early 1917; upon his return, he was arrested by the Dutch governmental authorities for "sowing hatred" and sentenced to a year in prison in Weltevreden, Batavia (now Sawah Besar, Jakarta). It was while in prison that Kartodikromo wrote Student Hidjo.
In the early 20th century, the introduction of Western technology and culture was leading to the fragmentation of the traditional Javanese lifestyle. Meanwhile, the Dutch Ethical Policy, which guaranteed certain rights and freedoms – such as the right to education and some press freedoms – was leading to social unrest. The tighter controls put on the press after 1906 led to Student Hidjo being published with the text "not to be quoted" ("") on the cover.
Plot
Hidjo is a young man from Surakarta, Central Java, who is engaged to Biroe, in accordance with his father's wishes. His father, a merchant named Raden Potronojo, orders Hidjo to go to the Netherlands and attend university; this is hoped to give the family greater status, as generally only priyayi (noble) families send their children abroad for schooling. Meanwhile, Dutch administrator Willem Walter, who views the Javanese positively, is engaged to a Dutch woman named Jet Roos; Roos is pregnant with his child.
In the Netherlands, Hidjo stays with a local family and enjoys the beauty of the Netherlands. The family's daughter, Betje, finds him intriguing because of his ethnicity. Although Hidjo initially receives her coldly, the two later become romantically and sexually involved. In Surakarta, Walter becomes attracted to Biroe and breaks off his engagement with Roos, who in turn aborts their child. This, and Biroe's rejection, leads him to return to the Netherlands, where he and Hidjo meet.
Hidjo, who has become increasingly distracted from his studies by his relationship with Betje, is recalled to the Indies by his family. He ends his relationship with the Dutchwoman, paying her his savings to make amends for doing so. When Hidjo returns to Surakarta, he marries Woengoe – who originates from a higher-class family than Biroe. Two years later, Hidjo has become district attorney of Djarak. Meanwhile, Walter has married Betje and returned to Surakarta to become assistant resident. Biroe marries Woengoe's brother Wardojo, who has become regent of the area. Roos marries the area's administrator, Boeren.
Style
Student Hidjo was written in Malay. When the novel was written, and indeed for numerous years afterwards, the Dutch colonial government was attempting to standardise Malay; the standardised form has been described by Hendrik Maier, a lecturer at Leiden University, as stilted. However, Kartodikromo did not attempt to follow these standards. According to Meier, unlike writers who used standardised Malay such as Armijn Pane and Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah in a "sad" manner, the language in Student Hidjo showed only "the enjoyment, the excitement, the thrill" of the writer, who "bubbled with anger".
Tsuyoshi Kato, a Japanese scholar of Indonesian literature, notes that Kartodikromo, like other Javanese authors, preferred to use the term "saya" when writing in the first-person, as opposed to Minangkabau writers who preferred "hamba". He writes that "saya" was preferred over a Javanese word due to first-person pronouns having highly different levels of politeness in that language. He writes that through works such as Student Hidjo and Rasa Merdika (A Sense of Freedom; 1924; by Soemantri), Javanese writers popularised the term; he describes "saya" as more active than "hamba" but more "contemplative and self-reflective" than the Javanese ngoko (crude) pronoun "aku".
Themes
Maier writes that the names of the main characters imply Student Hidjo should be read allegorically, with the names Hidjo (green), Woengoe (violet), and Biroe (blue) showing an interconnection between the characters. Kartodikromo described it as an extended simile.
The novel depicts a younger generation of Indonesians () as being "those who understand Dutch". Maier writes that this understanding is not limited to the language used, but also actions; this includes holding hands in public and drinking lemonade, activities which traditional Indonesian society does not involve. Student Hidjo also contrasts Dutch and Javanese peoples. Maier finds that, through its alternating events, the novel shows that the Dutch and Javanese are incompatible; Maeir sums it up as "Javanese do not feel at ease in Holland, [and] Dutch do not feel at ease in Java." According to Maier, the novel views the gap between the two cultures as "unbridgeable".
Maier writes that the novel includes themes of love, with Hidjo's love for Woengoe, Betje, and Biroe paralleling that of Walter's love for Roos, Woengoe, and Betje. He also notes that there is a theme of social mobility, where Hidjo's relationships with noble women are fostered by his merchant father to grant the family a greater social position; bride prices also feature prominently, showing that one can become a noble through marriage if one has enough money. He notes that, towards the end of the novel, love is described as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find, as the social-financial meaning of marriage remains predominant among the traditional Javanese. The characters, despite not all marrying for love, are happy with their eventual partners and have a comfortable life.
Release and reception
Student Hidjo was first published in 1918 as a serial in the Semarang-based daily Sinar Hindia, which Kartodikromo edited. The story was then collected in a book format and published by Masman & Stroink, a Semarang-based company, in 1919. When it was published, politically themed works were limited to smaller publishers. Works published by Balai Pustaka, the state-owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies, tended to be apolitical.
Kato writes that the novel is "unremarkable in terms of radical activism", but unrivaled in its imagination when compared to Sitti Nurbaya (1922; Marah Rusli), Salah Asuhan (Wrong Upbringing; 1927; Abdoel Moeis), and Rasa Merdika.

Rabot Point () is a high rocky point on the east side of James Ross Island, Antarctica. It lies in Markham Bay and separates the mouths of Gourdon and Hobbs Glaciers.
Origin of the name
A small glacier close west of The Watchtower on the south side of the island was originally named 'Rabot Gletscher', after the French glaciologist Charles Rabot, by Otto Nordenskjold, leader of the Swedish Antarctic Expedition 1901–04. However, the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey surveyed the south part of the island in 1953 and found the glacier to be very insignificant and does not require a name. In order to preserve the name Rabot in the vicinity, the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee decided to apply it to 'Rabot Point' instead.
Headlands of James Ross Island
Keys Hill () is a hill about high located at the head of Shearwater Glacier, west-southwest of the summit of Mount Bird in northwestern Ross Island, Antarctica. It was named by the New Zealand Geographic Board in 2000 after Gordon Keys, a leader of long term New Zealand Antarctic Programme atmospheric research, 1985–95.

The green-fronted white-eye (Zosterops minor) is a songbird species. It is closely related to the Old World babblers, and its family Zosteropidae might better be included in the Tiimalidae. Some sources include this species within Z. atrifrons, the black-crowned white-eye. The black-fronted white-eye (Z. chrysolaemus) was formerly considered a subspecies, and until it was split as a distinct species, the name "black-fronted white-eye" was also used for Z. minor.
It is found in New Guinea and offshore islands. Quite common, it is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.

Glenda Emilie Adams (née Felton; 30 December 1939 – 11 July 2007) was an Australian novelist and short story writer, probably best known as the winner of the 1987 Miles Franklin Award for Dancing on Coral. She was a teacher of creative writing, and helped develop writing programs.
Adams' work is found in her own books and short story collections, in numerous short story anthologies, and in journals and magazines. Her essays, stories and articles have been published in, among other magazines, Meanjin, The New York Times Book Review, Panorama, Quadrant, Southerly, Westerly, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Observer and The Village Voice.
Life
Glenda Emilie Felton was born in Ryde, New South Wales, a suburb of Sydney, the younger of two children. She attended Fort Street Primary School for two years and Sydney Girls High School before going to the University of Sydney from which she graduated with an honours degree in Indonesian.
She was a cousin of Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, but held opposing political views and wanted to become a political journalist. She moved to New York City when she won a scholarship to study at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and graduated in 1965. During this time, she met Gordon Adams, a political scientist at Columbia. They married in 1967 and had a daughter, Caitlin, before divorcing.
She worked as a lecturer at a number of tertiary institutions, including Columbia University and Sarah Lawrence College, before returning to Australia and the University of Technology, Sydney. Her subject was writing skills and creative writing. She helped design the master of arts writing program at the university, a program which became a model for postgraduate writing programs throughout Australia. For the rest of her life, she traveled regularly between New York to see her daughter and teach at Columbia, and Sydney. Glenda Adams died on 11 July 2007 in Sydney, following a battle with ovarian cancer and secondary brain tumours. Her funeral was held on 18 July. She was posthumously awarded the biennial ASA Medal of the Australian Society of Authors.
Literary career
Adams started writing at the age of 10, with the encouragement of her mother.
While at Columbia University, she joined a fiction workshop and started writing using her real name, after using a male name prior to that to prevent her friends knowing she was writing fiction. Her short stories were published in such magazines as Ms., The Village Voice and Harper's.
After 16 years away, she returned to Australia and became writer-in-residence at the University of Western Australia, the University of Adelaide, and Macquarie University. Her literary friends included Australians Robert Drewe and Kate Grenville (who she supervised as a graduate student at the University of Technology, Sydney,), and the American Grace Paley.
In 1987, her second novel, Dancing on Coral won the Miles Franklin Award and the New South Wales Premier's Literary Award but a residential rule for the latter resulted in her being denied it. Instead, the prize money was used for a fellowship for a young writer and she was compensated with a special award (with no money attached). Her third novel, Longleg, published in 1990, was also an award-winner. Her fourth novel, The Tempest of Clemenza was published in both Australia and the United States in 1996, and in 1998, her play, The Monkey Trap, was performed at the Griffin Theatre, in Sydney.

Morris Giwelb (1853 – March 1937) was a British stamp dealer, originally from the Province of Warsaw in Russian Poland, who, in his prime, became one of the most important dealers in the great rarities of philately.
He emigrated to England in 1882 and became a naturalized British citizen in 1887. Giwelb was noted for his genial and unassuming nature which contrasted with the rarity of the material in which he dealt. He owned a modest shop in Leicester Square and later the Strand, before eventually retiring to Brighton with his wife Natalie.
Giwelb was responsible for the unmasking of the forger Dr. Bernhardt Assmus, after he bought forged Penny Black VR official stamps from Assmus. He accompanied the police on a visit to Assmus' premises at 12 Church Street, Islington, and assisted them at Vine Street Police Station in sorting the seized material.
His wife was Natalie Giwelb.

Mimic 3: Sentinel is a 2003 science fiction horror film, directed by J. T. Petty, with a script inspired by a short story of the same name by Donald A. Wollheim. The movie was a direct-to-DVD sequel to Mimic (1997) and Mimic 2 (2001).
Mimic 3: Sentinel stars horror film veteran Lance Henriksen and takes a departure from the tone of the first two films, as it has a feel similar to Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window rather than the action/horror tone of its predecessors.
Plot
Unable to leave the germ-free confines of his sterilized bedroom for any real stretch of time, environmentally hypersensitive Marvin (Karl Geary) spends his days taking pictures of his neighbors from his window. Occasionally catching glimpses of his young sister Rosy (Alexis Dziena) hanging out with the neighborhood drug dealer, Marvin's lens remains mostly fixed on a mysterious neighbor known as the Garbageman (Lance Henriksen) and pretty neighbor Carmen (Rebecca Mader), while his slightly overbearing mother (Amanda Plummer) rests on the couch. As neighbors begin disappearing and mysterious figures move in and out of Marvin's viewfinder, the secluded voyeur begins to suspect that a sinister force is at work in his neighborhood. Though Rosy and Carmen are anxious to assist in a little detective work, the situation soon begins to spiral out of control upon the discovery that the Judas breed is far from extinct.

Dhamayatra (Thai: ธรรมยาตรา) is a name of an activity in which a group of people created a long distance walking campaign to peacefully represent the importance of some problems in society. Dhamayatra have been used many times, especially in south east Asia, including Thailand. One of the most famous Dhamayatra in Thailand is “Dhamayatra of Lumpatao River Basin” (Thai: ธรรมยาตราลุ่มน้ำลำปะทาว) which is a 7-day event held every year in Chaiyaphum province. “Dhamayatra of Lumpatao River Basin” has been held 16 times with the purpose of creating awareness of environmental problems in Thailand.
History
Lampatao Environment Issue
A long time ago, Lampatao river basin had an abundance of nature. But after the industrial revolution came to Thailand in the 1880s, the government changed the country's direction. They started a forest concession and created the Lumpatao Dam, which involved destroying a lot of forest in the process. They also encouraged farmers to do monoculture farming which uses a lot of chemical compounds. As the time past, the Lampatao River basin lost a lot of forest, many local animals and plant went extinct, and local people also faced many natural disasters.
Starting the Campaign
Luang Pho Kam Khean and Phra Paisal Visalo of Wat Pa Sukato in Lampatao River Basin observe that the environment in this area is a critical issue. They started the Dhamayatra in the year 2000[1] in order to generate an awareness of this environmental issue. The main target was the local villagers.
Daily life and activities
People
A core team consists of monks from Wat Pa Sukato who are led by Luang Pho Kam Khean and Pra Paisan Visalo and the group also includes people from the province.
Moreover, each year other interested people participate in the events, including villagers, student activists, and NGO workers.
Route
The walking path is changed every year, but it always is approximately 100 km in length, which is split into seven days. Participants start by walking only a short distance in the very first day and then increase the distance slightly with each successive day. Each day is split into morning and afternoon trips, with a lunch break in between. And there are some short breaks during each period.
They walk past a variety of atmospheres. The participants walk across the mountain, the forest and the city by the lead of monks. They continue the walk, regardless of the weather.
Living
The waking goal in each day is to arrive at the next milestone in order to rest at night, which is almost always a temple. Because in Thailand, a Buddhist country, many temples are spread all around the country, so it is a very good place for the group to get rest.
The meals, including breakfast and lunch, come from food that villagers have given to the temple. They don't take dinner due to the monks' dietary rules. But some days, the group also need to rest in a forest. On those days, meals need to be pre-prepared.
Meditating
Because Dhamayatra uses the thought of Dhamma, the participants also meditate. Praying and meditating are done both in the morning and in the evening. They also pray for the nature before starting the walk each day.
Activities
This campaign also has activities for people in the group which can be separated according to two purposes. The first are science-based activities which give knowledge. They have water checking activities to show the problems of low-quality water in the area they walk past, blood tests to show how many chemical compounds are in their bodies, and an organic fertilizer making activity to teach villagers an alternative to using chemical fertilizers.
The second are social-based activities which help the people in the group to know each other better, such as games and the exchanging of knowledge and experience.

The Chevrolet 153 cu in engine was an inline-four engine designed in the early 1960s for use in the Chevy II. It is a four-cylinder variant of the Turbo-Thrift six-cylinder engine. After 1970 GM ceased production of the 153 engine in North America because of low demand (and the inline-six was thereafter made the base engine in the Nova), but the engine continued to be used in cars in other markets around the world, notably South Africa and Brazil. The engine was also standard equipment in the Jeep DJ-5A—used by the United States Postal Service—until American Motors bought Kaiser Jeep in 1970 and replaced the engine with the AMC straight-six in the DJ-5B. Currently descendants of the 153 engine are used in industrial (e.g. forklifts and generators) and marine applications. The 153 engine is entirely different from the Iron Duke engine introduced by Pontiac in 1977, most noticeably never having featured the Pontiac engine's crossflow cylinder head, but the two are often confused today.
Earlier when Chevrolet first became a division of General Motors in 1917, the OHV Chevrolet Inline-4 engine was manufactured from 1913 until 1928 when it was replaced by the "Stovebolt Six".
History
The compact Chevrolet Corvair was introduced in 1960 to compete with the Ford Falcon and Plymouth Valiant, but was handily outsold by its competitors. Fearing the Corvair's more radical engineering (featuring a rear-mounted air-cooled flat-six engine) was not appealing to consumers GM hastily approved the design of a new, more conventional compact car to compete with the Falcon and Valiant. Within 18 months the design of the Chevy II was completed, including new four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines to power it.
The 153 cu in engine had a bore and stroke, with two overhead valves per cylinder actuated by pushrods and a 1-3-4-2 firing order. The Chevy II's 194 cu in six-cylinder used a bore, which by 1964 was enlarged to match the 153 four-cylinder's resulting in a displacement of . The 230 cu in six and 153 cu in four are thus essentially the same design, differing only in cylinder count.
In the Chevy II the engine was branded as the Super-Thrift 153, while in the 1964 Chevy Van it was called the High Torque 153. Peak power and torque were at 4,000 rpm and at 2,400 rpm.
After the 1970 model year the engine was discontinued in North America.
Brazil
The 153 engine was used by GM do Brasil in their first locally-made product, the 1968 Chevrolet Opala. In 1973 the Brazilian engineers redesigned the engine in order to quell vibrations, decreasing the stroke to and increasing the connecting rod lengths to . To keep the power output similar to the 153 they correspondingly increased the bore to , resulting in displacement. This 2,471 cc variant of the engine was in production in the Opala until 1992. Coincidentally the bore and stroke are the exact same as the Pontiac Iron Duke engine introduced in North America in 1977, but the two engines are otherwise unrelated and do not share parts. As is customary in Brazil the engine was refit to accept ethanol fuel.
South Africa
This engine was a mainstay for GMSA, who built it in their Aloes Plant (on the northern edge of Port Elizabeth) for installation in a wide range of cars. Two smaller displacement versions of this engine were also built there: a variant using the 153's bore and the Brazilian 151 cu in engine's stroke, and a variant which used the 153's stroke and the 194 cu in six-cylinder's bore. The engine was also used by the SADF in the Eland armoured car from the Mk. 5 upgrade.
Argentina
GM de Argentina designed their own variant of the engine called the Chevrolet 110. The smaller displacement was achieved by using the bore of the 194 cu in straight-six and a unique, short stroke. The engine was designed for use in the locally-built Opel K 180, in production from 1974 to 1978.

Vortec 3000
GM produced a variant of the 153 for use in industrial and marine applications, with the Brazilian version's larger bore and a longer stroke. The resulting engine, branded the Vortec 3000, was never installed in passenger cars.
Later variants of the Vortec 3000 had modified cylinder heads where machined bosses were drilled for use with multipoint fuel injection.

"Calling All Angels" is a song by American rock band Train. It was included on the band's third studio album, My Private Nation, and produced by Brendan O'Brien. It features Greg Leisz on pedal steel guitar.
The song was the first track to be released from My Private Nation, on April 14, 2003, and peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also topped three other Billboard charts: the Adult Alternative Songs, Adult Contemporary, and Adult Top 40 listings. Outside the US, the song entered the top 40 in Australia and New Zealand.
Background
"Calling All Angels" was inspired by a conversation singer Pat Monahan had with his therapist. Monahan said, "She said, "Just remember that we are made up of angels and traitors, and the angel is the one that says, 'You're beautiful and you can do anything you want,' and the traitor is the one that says, 'You're ugly and you can't get anything right.'" And so that song just came from that conversation of, if we all called our angels, what a cool life this would be for all of us."
Critical reception
The song received mixed reviews from rock critics, with Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly giving the song a B+ and calling it "an anthemic hymn to commitment...that builds steadily to a gloriously clanging climax." Matt Lee of the BBC was less impressed, describing the track as "pedestrian, the vocals soulless, even more so than" the band's biggest hit single, "Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)".
Awards and nominations
The recording was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the ceremony held in February 2004. In the category Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group, it lost out to "Disorder in the House" by Bruce Springsteen and Warren Zevon. In the category Best Rock Song, the winner was "Seven Nation Army" by The White Stripes.

Cover versions
In 2016, the song was used in the US version of The Passion. It was sung by Jencarlos and appeared of the official soundtrack album. It was sung in the story when Jesus (Jencarlos) prays in the Garden of Gethsemane. The tempo was slowed, several lyrics were changed, and the third verse was entirely cut to fit the theme of the scene.
In popular culture
"Calling All Angels" is an unofficial anthem of the Los Angeles Angels baseball team, and is played at Angel Stadium before every game while the video screen shows a montage of the team's history. In addition, the band performed it live prior to the Home Run Derby of the 2010 All-Star Game, which was held at Angel Stadium.

The 1669–70 papal conclave (20 December – 29 April) was convened on the death of Pope Clement IX and ended with the election of Cardinal Emilio Altieri as Pope Clement X. The election saw deference within the College of Cardinals to Louis XIV of France, and a freeing of the cardinals loyal to Spain to vote according to their conscience. Eventually the elderly Altieri was elected with support of the major factions within the College.
Background
Clement IX had primarily named Italian cardinals to the college, only appointing one French and one Spanish cardinal when he needed their assistance to fight back an invasion by the Ottoman Empire in Crete. He created his friends cardinals, with seven of the twelve that he created coming from his native Tuscany. Clement did not feel obligated to appoint a German cardinal because the Holy Roman Emperor had requested his assistance in Hungary. Within days of his death Clement IX had created seven additional cardinals, which brought the number of potential electors to its maximum of seventy.
During his pontificate Clement strove diplomatically to bring Western European nations to the defense of Crete. The Ottomans were planning to advance on the Venetian owned capital of the island at Candia. He intervened in the War of Devolution and helped negotiate a peace, which increased the likelihood that Spain and France would both aid Crete. The French initially sent a small force to aid Crete in 1668, before increasing their troop commitment in 1669. This did affect the outcome of the Ottoman advance, and they captured Candia in September 1669.
Within the College of Cardinals a faction of cardinals that was not loyal to any of the Catholic monarchies had developed; they were called the Squadrone Volante had and risen during the conclave of 1655. The name, which translates as Flying Squadron, was given because of their support of candidates who they believed had the best interest of the papacy in mind, rather than candidates supported by the secular monarch. Christina, Queen of Sweden, who had abdicated the Swedish throne and moved to Rome before converting to the Catholic Church, served as the secular supporter of the group, and became particularly close to Decio Azzolino.
Conclave
The cardinals delayed the conclave until the ambassador of Louis XIV of France and the French cardinals arrived, which demonstrated the influence France had in the College at that time. When it opened on 21 December 1669, fifty-four of the seventy members of the College of Cardinals were present, and twelve additional cardinals arrived as the conclave progressed. The factions broke down relatively evenly between the cardinals loyal to Spain and France, with each country controlling eight. Clement IX's nephew Jacopo Rospigliosi's influence in the conclave was relatively weak as Clement IX had only created eight cardinals, whereas Flavio Chigi led twenty-four creations of Alexander VII.
The College of Cardinals at the time did not have any cardinals that stood out as the obvious frontrunner, and the number of papabili was greater than at most conclaves. Accounts from contemporary sources listed up to 21 cardinals who were considered to have a chance of being elected pope.
Pietro Vidoni had the support of members of the Flying Squadron as well as Christina of Sweden and her ally Azzolino. Also, he was opposed by neither France nor Spain. Francesco Barberini, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, opposed Vidoni because he had not been asked about his candidacy previously.
Charles d'Albert d'Ailly, the French ambassador to the conclave, arrived on 16 January 1670. He announced on 10 February that Louis XIV had vetoed Chigi's candidate for the papacy, Scipione Pannocchieschi d'Elci. The exclusion caused d'Elci much embarrassment, and he became sick and quickly died after the French veto was announced. Following d'Elci's exclusion, there was confusion amongst the cardinals about whom they should elect, because none of the existing candidates had the numerical possibility of being elected pope.
The cardinals then attempted to elect Vidoni again, but Chigi was now opposed to him out of anger at the French for excluding d'Elci. The Spanish cardinals also worked against Vidoni, implying at one point that Mariana of Austria, the Queen regent of Spain, had excluded Vidoni's candidacy. The Spanish then attempted to elect Benedetto Odescalchi, but d'Ailly declared that no one would be allowed to be elected unless they owed loyalty to Louis XIV. The Spanish soon sent word that their cardinals were free to vote for anyone. The letter was brought by courier and announced that Mariana of Austria had not actually excluded Vidoni nor any member of the college.
Election of Clement X
In late April all the factions except the Flying Squadron had disappeared, and the cardinals had agreed to elect Emilio Altieri. On 29 April 1670 Altieri received three votes at the scrutiny in the morning, which was the same number he had received consistently since the beginning of the conclave. At the afternoon scrutiny, he received twenty-one votes, and was shortly acclaimed pope by an additional thirty-five cardinals. This brought his final total to fifty-six out of a total possible of fifty-nine electors. Altieri was old and was in poor health, and resisted his own election to the point where he had to be dragged out of his room by two cardinals in order to be acclaimed. His election took place at 3 pm, but he resisted being elected for an hour. He took the name Clement in honour of Clement IX, who had created him a cardinal. At the age of 79, Altieri is the oldest person to have been elected pope.

Davida Coady (April 15, 1938 - May 3, 2018) was a U.S. pediatrician and international health activist. She was "devoted to the care of disadvantaged children, refugees, addicts, and lifers".
Early life and education
Davida Coady was born Davida Taylor in Berkeley, California as an only child to Catholic parents. Her Scottish father had been a coal miner before immigrating to the US and became a shipping clerk for the University of California, Berkeley. Her mother Elizabeth Perry was a legal secretary and had grown up in San Francisco's Mission District. Coady attended Berkeley High School, and later the College of the Pacific in Stockton, California to study music. Working in a summer diabetes camp as a counselor, she was inspired by the two female pediatricians and switched to medicine. She graduated from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1965.
She completed her pediatric residency back on the West Coast at UCLA. To learn more about the role of nutrition in child health, Harold Brown (parasitologist) advised her to get a certificate in international nutrition at the Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama in Guatemala.
Advised by Thomas Weller she also obtained a master's degree in public health at Harvard University in 1969.
Career
After the 1967 Biafra War Coady worked as field director for Aid to Biafran Children, a non-governmental organisation to help amidst the famine, which threatened as many as 1 million people.
During the 1970s Coady worked in India with the WHO Programme on smallpox eradication.
In the 1980s, she spent time in Latin America working with refugees. She worked for the Peace Corps, including a stint as acting medical director.
In 1993, Coady became president of the Hesperian Foundation after founder David Werner was forced to resign due to allegations of sexual relationships with underage boys in Mexico.
In 1998, Catholic Charities named her the "Bay Area Catholic Woman of the Year". Mother Teresa asked her to consider become a nun and medical director in Kolkata.
In the mid-1990s, Coady was working as an emergency room physician at Oakland Children's Hospital, in California. When she realized that physical abuse in children was tightly linked to alcohol or drugs, she founded a rehabilitation program in 1996 for alcoholics and drug users which worked closely with Californian courts. The group has helped more than 10 000 men and women in the Californian prison system.
Coady participated in the annual protest against the School of Americas where US military trains soldiers from Central America; she walked alongside Dan Berrigan, Pete Seeger and Martin Sheen. She helped Cesar Chavez set up a health program for migrant workers. She joined political protests in support of migrant workers and against nuclear weapons. She was arrested about 50 times.
Personal life
Coady married former priest Patrick Coady and divorced.
Coady struggled with alcoholism, drinking heavily until the 1990s.
She founded substance abuse centers.
In 2002, she married Tom Gorham, a recovering alcoholic, former criminal and homeless man, after they had met in prison. Gorham became the executive director of Options Recovery Services. He has said Coady was "driven by an intense desire to help people see past perceived obstacles". Coady died of ovarian cancer in a hospice in Alamo, California near her home in Berkeley.

John McLeod (8 March 1934 – 24 March 2022) was a Scottish composer who wrote music in many media including film and television.
Biography
He was born in Aberdeen, but later settled in Edinburgh. He initially studied clarinet at the Royal Academy of Music with Jack Brymer, Reginald Kell, and Gervase de Peyer, but then switched to composition with Sir Lennox Berkeley.
McLeod was Associate Composer of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra from 1980-1982 and the orchestra commissioned Out of the Silence, premiered in 2015. His works have also been performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Halle Orchestra and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. The BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra has broadcast 12 of his major orchestral works, including the London premiere of The Sun Dances (2000) at the BBC Proms in 2014. The National Youth Orchestra of Scotland has regularly featured his work in over 20 concerts, including the Piano Concerto (1988) in 2015, when it was conducted by the composer with James Willshire as soloist in Glasgow and Dundee.
His Clarinet Concerto (2005) was premiered at the Queen's Hall in Edinburgh on 13 May 2007 by the Meadows Chamber Orchestra with soloist Jean Johnson.
Other notable orchestral works include the Percussion Concerto (1987) (written for, performed and recorded by Evelyn Glennie), Symphonies of Stone and Water (2000), the Guitar Concerto (2009) and the Viola Concerto (2018, written for Scottish Chamber Orchestra principal viola Jane Atkins). McLeod also composed choral music (including a Stabat Mater, 1985 and the cantata Chronicle of Saint Machar, 1998), chamber music (including A Moment in Time for violin, clarinet, cello and piano in 2002), and numerous songs and song cycles.
A double CD of his complete piano music was recorded live from four concerts at Stoller Hall in Manchester, August 2017. It includes the five piano sonatas (1978–2013), the Four Impromptus (1960), Five Hebridean Dances (1981) and the 12 Preludes (1984).
In 2014, McLeod was rewarded with a BASCA Gold Badge Award. This was in recognition of his unique contribution to music. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to music.
John McLeod died in Edinburgh on 24 March 2022 aged 88, six months after the death of his wife Margaret (1936–2021), who was a respected piano adjudicator and examiner.

Rainbow Ridge () is a small ridge which forms a distinct western rim to the large crater-like depression high in the central part of Brown Peninsula, in Victoria Land in Antarctica. Given this geologically descriptive name by the New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC), it arose from investigations by the New Zealand Geological Survey and the Victoria University Expedition in 1964–65. The top of the ridge has been planed off by subsequent glaciation and the resultant surface exposes two basalt "pipes" (Nubian Formation) within the trachyte. These have altered the trachyte at their margins to various shades of brown, hence the name of the ridge.

The Manor of St. Sepulchre (also known as the Archbishop's Liberty) was one of several manors, or liberties, that existed in Dublin, Ireland since the arrival of the Anglo-Normans in the 12th century. They were townlands united to the city, but still preserving their own jurisdiction.
St. Sepulchre's was under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Dublin, although from time to time the Dublin city government claimed ownership of it.
Location
The importance of the Manor of St. Sepulchre was enhanced in that it consisted of a number of manors, many of which lay outside the city or even county of Dublin. The manor of St. Sepulchre in the city was the principal manor. The city manor boundaries stretched from Bishop St. to St. Stephen's Green, along Harcourt Street to Donnybrook, across Rathgar to Harold's Cross and back along Clanbrassil Street. In 1523-4 Archbishop Hugh Inge was engaged in a legal dispute with the Mayor and Corporation of Dublin, who had apparently taken possession of the manor.
An Act of the Parliament of Ireland of 2 June 1774 (13 & 14 Geo.III c.34) formed a barony, the Barony of St. Sepulchre, from that part of the manor lying north of the South Circular Road. This had previously been part of the barony of Uppercross. Within it were the civil parishes of St. Kevin, St. Nicholas Without and part of St. Peter's. The barony was abolished by the Dublin Baronies Act 1842 (5 & 6 Vict. c.96), when the area was transferred from the county to the city.
Outside the city there were manors belonging to St. Sepulchre's in Swords, Lusk, Shankhill, Tallaght, Finglas and other places. Each of these manors was governed by a portreeve, who was sworn in each Easter by the seneschal of St. Sepulchre.
Privileges
In return for the support of the Archbishop, or to alleviate certain hardships suffered by Englishmen or the church in Ireland, privileges were granted to the manor (that is, to the archbishop and his successors) at various times and by various kings of England. These allowed the city manor (and its constituent manors outside the city) to have their own courts of justice (Courts Leet, Courts Baron and a Court of Record, where they were allowed to try all crimes except "forestalling, rape, treasure-trove and arson"), free customs, freedom from certain taxes and services, impose their own fines, have their own coroners, rights of salvage, maintain their own fairs and markets, regulate weights and measures, etc. For those condemned to death, the archbishop had his own gallows at Harold's Cross.
These rights and privileges were ended by the Manor Court of Saint Sepulchre Abolition Act 1856, the last such jurisdiction remaining in Ireland.
Administration
The headquarters of the city manor (and consequently, of all St. Sepulchre manors) was the Palace of St. Sepulchre, located now where Kevin St. Garda barracks stands. This was originally constructed by John Comyn, the first Anglo-Norman Archbishop of Dublin, appointed in 1180. The name was suggested by the campaigns being waged by the Crusaders for the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre from the Muslims. Comyn was shortly after granted land by the monarchy for the See of Dublin, which provided the basis for the manor. This palace remained the seat of the Archbishops of Dublin until 1806.
A courthouse (still standing) and gaol for the use of the manor were built in the early 19th century at the corner of Long Lane and Bride St. Most of the prisoners were insolvent debtors. Much of the business of the court related to trading, fairs, weights and measures matters. Attending court was difficult for those manor residents living outside the city, in Swords, Lusk or elsewhere, most of whom were quite poor. The same difficulty applied to jurors, who were fined for not attending court when summoned. All income from court activity went to the Archbishop.
In 1813 the population of this manor was 3,728 males and 5,273 females.

TSV Steinbach Haiger is a German association football club from Steinbach, near Haiger, Hesse.
The club's greatest success has been to earn promotion to the tier four Regionalliga Südwest in 2015.
History
For most of its history the club was a non-descript amateur side in local football. The club had a brief spell in the Bezirksklasse in the 1980s but quickly returned to the local A- and B- Klasse.
The rise of TSV Steinbach began in the mid-2000s. After relegation from the tier eight Kreisliga A, the club spent four seasons in the Kreisliga B before starting its impressive run of five promotions in six seasons. The club won the Kreisliga B in 2009, followed by a title in the Kreisliga A in 2010. TSV Steinbach finished runners-up in the Kreisoberliga in 2010 but was still promoted, followed by another championship in 2012, now in the Gruppenliga. In the Verbandsliga Hessen-Mitte TSV's rise came to a temporary halt in 2012–13 when the club came only seventh. The following season however, 2013–14, the club won its Verbandsliga division and earned promotion to the Hessenliga for the first time.
In the 2014–15 season, TSV Steinbach played in the Hessenliga where it won another championship and earned promotion to the Regionalliga Südwest.
For the 2018–19 season, the club was renamed from TSV Steinbach to TSV Steinbach Haiger.

The Transgender Gender-Variant & Intersex Justice Project (TGI Justice Project or TGIJP) is a San Francisco-based nonprofit organization working to end human rights abuses against transgender, intersex, and gender-variant people, particularly trans women of color in California prisons and detention centers. Originally led by Black trans activist Miss Major Griffin-Gracy and Asian American trans man and activist Alexander L. Lee (also the organization's founder), the current executive director of TGIJP is Janetta Johnson, a Black trans woman who was formerly incarcerated in a men's prison.
In 2016, TGIJP joined Black Lives Matter in withdrawing from the San Francisco Pride Parade, in protest of increased police presence at the event.

Kurtus indicus, the Indian humphead, is a species of fish in the family Kurtidae native to fresh, brackish, and marine waters of the coastal regions of southern Asia from India to southeast China and Indonesia. It resembles the closely related K. gulliveri, but is far smaller, only reaching a length of . Although it has been suggested that the male carries the egg cluster on a hook protruding from the forehead (as known from K. gulliveri), available evidence strongly suggests this is not the case in K. indicus: Out of several thousand examined, none carried eggs in this manner and the male's hook is likely also too small. The female lacks the hook entirely. It is of minor importance to local commercial fisheries.

The Vittoriale degli italiani (English translation: The shrine of victories of the Italians) is a hillside estate in the town of Gardone Riviera overlooking Lake Garda in province of Brescia, in Lombardy. It is where the Italian poet and novelist Gabriele d'Annunzio lived after his defenestration in 1922 until his death in 1938. The estate consists of the residence of d'Annunzio called the Prioria (priory), an amphitheatre, the protected cruiser set into a hillside, a boathouse containing the MAS vessel used by D'Annunzio in 1918 and a circular mausoleum. Its grounds are now part of the Grandi Giardini Italiani.
References to the Vittoriale range from a “monumental citadel” to a “fascist lunapark”, the site inevitably inheriting the controversy surrounding its creator.
History
The house, Villa Cargnacco, had belonged to the German art historian of the Italian Renaissance Henry Thode, from whom it was confiscated by the Italian state, including artworks, a collection of books, and a piano which had belonged to Liszt. d'Annunzio rented it in February 1921 and within a year reconstruction started under the guidance of architect Giancarlo Maroni. Due to d'Annunzio's popularity and his disagreement with the fascist government on several issues, such as the alliance with Nazi Germany, the fascists did what they could to please d'Annunzio in order to keep him away from political life in Rome. Part of their strategy was to make huge funds available to expand the property, to construct and/or modify buildings, and to create the impressive art and literature collection. In 1924 the airplane that d'Annunzio used for his pamphleteering run over Vienna during World War I was brought to the estate, followed in 1925 by the MAS naval vessel used by him to taunt the Austrians in 1918 in the Beffa di Buccari. In the same year the bow section of the protected cruiser was hauled up the hill and placed in the woods behind the house, and the property was expanded by acquisition of surrounding lands and buildings.
In 1926 the government donated an amount of 10 million lire, which allowed a considerable enlargement of the Villa, with a new wing named the Schifamondo. In 1931 construction was started on the Parlaggio, the name for the amphitheatre. The mausoleum was designed after d'Annunzio's death but not actually built until 1955, and d'Annunzio's remains were finally brought there in 1963.
Buildings
The Prioria
The Prioria itself consists of a number of rooms opulently decorated and filled with memorabilia. Notable are the two waiting rooms, one for welcome guests, one for unwelcome ones. It is the latter where Benito Mussolini was sent to on his visit in 1925. A phrase was inscribed specifically for him above the mirror:
To the visitor:
Are you bringing Narcissus' Mirror?
This is leaded glass, my mask maker.
Adjust your mask to your face,
But mind that you are glass against steel.
The leper's room is where D'Annunzio's wake was held upon his death. Its name comes from the fact that d'Annunzio felt that he was being spurned by the government due to their continued efforts to keep him in Gardone, rather than possibly in the limelight in Rome.
The Relic room holds a large collection of religious statues and images of different beliefs, purposely placed together to make a statement about the universal character of spirituality. The inscription on the inner wall reads:
As there are five fingers on a hand, there are only five mortal sins.
D'Annunzio wished to make clear hereby that he didn't believe that lust and greed should be considered sinful.
A most unlikely relic is the distorted steering wheel of racing speedboat Miss England II, donated after the coppa dell oltranza (unlimited cup) powerboating trophy, organized under d'Annunzio patronage, was held in 1931.
Miss England II had crashed in a world speed record attempt, killing her pilot, Sir Henry Seagrave in 1930 (though winning the record nevertheless) and was rebuilt to race and win at Lake Garda the following year with Kaye Don at the helm.
D'annunzio who was a syncretist deemed the distorted steering wheel "a relic of the religion of courage".
The amphitheatre
The amphitheatre is the first major structure one comes across after entering the estate and was clearly based upon classical models, the architect Maroni even visiting Pompeii for inspiration. Its location, like the other buildings of the Vittoriale, undeniably offers a majestic view of the Garda lake, it is still used for performances today.
The mausoleum
The circular structure is situated on the highest point on the estate. It contains the remains of men who served D'Annunzio and died during the Fiume period, and d'Annunzio himself.
The protected cruiser Puglia
Jutting out of one of the hilltops, the bow section of the cruiser Puglia makes a surreal sight. It was placed there pointing in the direction of the Adriatic, “ready to conquer the Dalmatian shores”.

Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Head or Tail of It is an interactive fiction video game written by Jeff O'Neill and published by Infocom in 1987. It was released simultaneously for MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and other platforms. Nord and Bert was unique among Infocom games in that it used the game engine to present wordplay puzzles rather than an adventure story. It was Infocom's twenty-seventh game.
Plot
Each chapter of Nord and Bert is dedicated to a different style of wordplay. The first seven chapters can be played in any order, since each exists as an independent "short story" unrelated to the other chapters; to begin the eighth, however, the player must provide seven "passwords" provided by completing each of the other sections.
The only effort made to interlink the separate parts of the game is as follows: reality has somehow been altered around the town of Punster. Idioms and clichés are suddenly manifesting themselves quite literally, and it falls to the player, as it always does, to sort things out.
The sections of the game:
"The Shopping Bizarre" - this portion takes place in a grocery store where normal products have been replaced by outlandish homonyms. The player must change all the oddities back to their original form by simply typing the correct names. For instance, when confronted with a large, awkward-looking mammal sporting hooves and antlers that smells of fudge, the player must type "" (a homonym for "moose").
"Playing Jacks" - this section is rather short and unfocused, and involves a gadget called the "Jack of All Traits" (which is, of course, a play on the phrase "Jack of all trades"). When presented with a series of unusual situations, this item proves useful by displaying attributes of other items whose name contains "Jack". For instance, when a mermaid tangled in fishing line washes ashore, the player can turn the Jack of All Traits into a Jackknife and cut the lines.
"Buy the Farm" - this chapter takes place around a farm and requires the player to use a variety of clichéd expressions literally, for instance or .
"Eat Your Words" - another section of idioms presented literally, this time revolving around a diner. The player must alternately insult and apologize to a waitress by using phrases such as or . When the waitress is sufficiently exasperated, she allows the player to enter the kitchen, where the chef is murderously hostile until the player "leaves the cook to his own devices" and "gores his ox".
"Act the Part" - the player must take part in a 50s-style sitcom and perform visual gags and bits of slapstick comedy, including giving someone a "hotfoot" and playing along with knock-knock jokes.
"Manor of Speaking" - this chapter takes place in a house filled with bizarre rooms. Although this section has several puzzles reminiscent of Infocom's "straightforward" interactive fiction games, they are played for surreal humor. As an example: a room called The Kremlin has a talking portrait of Karl Marx. The player must wind a clock and place it inside a box, and then enter the Kremlin. The portrait of Marx assumes that the ticking box is a bomb and falls off the wall, revealing a safe which can be opened using the clock's "winding" key.
"Shake a Tower" - this section ties a number of situations into an absurd story using spoonerisms. The tangled phrase can be entered by itself, such as "pretty girl" for "gritty pearl". Sometimes certain actions must be performed first, such as feeding stones to set up the change from "fed rocks" to a "red fox".
"Meet the Mayor" - the final chapter can only be played after the rest of the game has been successfully completed. Elements of many of the preceding sections are mixed here as the player tries to convince Punster's mayor to sign a law. Some puzzle solutions are phrases that are merely hinted at by the surroundings, such as "Possession is nine-tenths of the law" or "taking something under false pretenses."
Release
The Nord and Bert packaging includes Home on the Range, a physical booklet of wordplay-themed cartoons drawn by Kevin Pope (who also illustrated the front and back of the game package). The cartoons illustrate several of the types of puzzles in the game, with each cartoon corresponding to a section of the game.
Reception
Computer Gaming Worlds reviewer did not enjoy Nord and Bert as much as the "more complete" previous Infocom games, stating that the game often did not accept seemingly valid word play responses. He suggested that the game might be used to teach word play to students. Compute! more favorably reviewed the game, praising its humor, the puzzles' creativity, and the fact that individual games could be finished in a brief period. Compute!'s Gazette also liked the wordplay, stated that the game "should appeal to most everyone", and especially recommended it to those who avoided other text adventures. Antics reviewer was critical, stating "I cannot recommend this game" because puzzles could not be solved by logic alone. He concluded, "I give Infocom an A for originality but will spend my money on something else".

The Vatican City Championship () is the top men's association football league of Vatican City. Founded in 1972 as the Coppa Amicizia, teams are composed of workers representing various state departments. Teams are permitted to field an outside player from Italian amateur teams to play as goalkeeper. The league's best players are combined to form the Vatican City national team for rare friendly matches. The Vatican football association, Federazione Vaticanese Giuoco Calcio, is not a member of FIFA and is overseen by its president Domenico Ruggerio as of May 2014. All matches are played at the Associazione Sportivo La Salle complex in Western Rome, although the larger Campo Cardinale Francis Joseph Spellman served as home until recently. The league has amateur status with matches and training taking place outside of work hours. Matches take place on Mondays and Tuesdays. Equipment and uniforms are occasionally donated by organizations and benefactors with deficits being covered by the Vatican government. The league takes place between October and May each year with a two-month break in December and January.
History
The first organized football took place in the Vatican in 1947 when a four-team league was staged. The final that year was contested between Pontifical Villas and Fabbrica di San Pietro. The league was suspended shortly after creation because of fierce competitiveness. Only friendly matches were allowed for the next two decades until another league was reformed in 1966. Seven teams competed during the first season with employees of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican newspaper, claiming the first championship. The current league was founded as the Coppa Amicizia, later renamed the Campionato della Citta Vaticano, by Sergio Valci who was former president of the FA and a Vatican healthcare employee until his death in 2012.
A secondary cup known as the Coppa ACDV was created in 1985. It was renamed the Coppa Sergio Valci in 1994. The Vatican Supercoppa began in 2005 and sees the winner of the Campionato della Citta Vaticano face the Coppa ACDV winners.

The Clermont Avenue Skating Rink was a sports arena on Clermont Avenue in Brooklyn, New York, United States. It was home to the Brooklyn Skating Club and the Brooklyn Crescents of the American Amateur Hockey League from 1896 to 1906.
The ice hockey team of the Brooklyn Skating Club folded in 1906 and the Brooklyn Crescents went on to play at the St. Nicholas Rink in Manhattan for the 1906–07 season as the Clermont Avenue Skating Rink instead was used for roller hockey.

The Vienna coup is an unblocking technique in contract bridge made in preparation for a squeeze play. It is so named because it was originally published by James Clay (1804-1873) after observing it being executed in the days of whist by "the greatest player in Vienna" — identity unknown.
Examples
On the play of the A by South, East is squeezed but can escape by throwing a small heart. Although the Q is now set up, South must next play either the Q, 2 or 4 to be won in dummy and has no entry back to cash it; he must now lose a spade to East.
However, if instead, South plays the 2 to the A, East is squeezed when declarer next leads the 2 to the ace.
In this layout there is no way to get back to the hand by playing the 2 to the ace. In this case, the A must-have been cashed already at an earlier stage to squeeze East when declarer leads the A and discards the 2 from the table.

The Hernandiaceae are a family of flowering plants (angiosperms) in the order Laurales. Consisting of five genera with about 58 known species, they are distributed over the world's tropical areas, some of them widely distributed in coastal areas, but they occur from sea level to over 2000 m.
The family is closely related to the Lauraceae, and many species inhabit laurel forest habitat; they have laurel-like (lauroid) leaves. Based on morphology, chromosome numbers, geographical distribution, and phylogenetic analyses, the family is clearly divided into two groups that have been given the rank of subfamilies Gyrocarpoideae and Hernandioideae.
Overview
The Hernandiaceae are important components of tropical forests, ranging from low-lying to montane forests.
In general, there is a worldwide lack of knowledge about the family; little is yet known about its diversity. At a national level, in some countries with limited economic means, the majority of specimens are poorly determined or undetermined down to species. Recently-described species come from collections made in such countries. Trees of the family Hernandiaceae occur predominantly in the world's laurel forests and cloud forests, which occur in tropical, subtropical, and mild temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, especially in the African, Indian and Pacific Ocean islands, New Caledonia, Madagascar, and central Chile.
The main economic uses for this family are essential oils, found in many species that are important for spices and perfumes, and the hardwood of many species is a source for timber around the world. A great number of species are in danger of extinction due to overexploitation as medicinal plants, timber extraction and loss of habitat.
Description
The family consists of trees, shrubs or lianas. The plants bear essential oils. The leaves are alternate, aromatic, simple or compound, palmately veined, cross-venulate. They are often peltate in Hernandia. Where the leaves are compound, they are . The leaves are stipulated. There is a cork cambium present in the bark; in young growth, this is only superficial. The nodes are unilacunar.
The primary vascular tissue is arranged in a cylinder, without separate bundles. Cortical bundles are absent. Medullary bundles are absent. Internal phloem is absent. Secondary thickening develops from a conventional cambial ring, but included phloem is absent. The xylem has libriform fibres. Vessel elements are without vestured pits and end-walls are simple. The wood parenchyma is paratracheal. Sieve-tube plastids are type I and of the P-type.
Taxonomy
The family has been recognised by most taxonomists.
The APG IV system (2016) recognizes this family, and assigns it to the order Laurales in the clade Magnoliids. As circumscribed by APG, the family includes those plants that sometimes have been treated as forming the family Gyrocarpaceae.
Genera
Gyrocarpus was considered in the Cronquist system to belong to a separate family, the Gyrocarpaceae.

Ecology
The Hernandiaceae species inhabit ecosystems with monoecious (rarely dioecious), deciduous or evergreen trees, shrubs, and perennial climbing plants. The mode of dispersion is variable among species.
Most species of genus Hernandia have red fruit, suggesting zoochory, while Hernandia guianensis is hydrochorian in fresh water, and H. nymphaeifolia and Gyrocarpus americanus are hydrochorian in seawater.
Some fruits open very violently, expelling the seeds at some distance. Others are small nuts or non-fleshy bodies (achenes) provided with hooks or filaments that attach to the fur of animals, or are shaped to float in water or to facilitate transport by wind.
They are distributed in the lower areas of the tropics, especially in rain forests, cloud forests, and laurel forest, although some species exist even in subtropical or arid areas; they occur from sea level to over 2000 m. The relict character of distributions in Africa and the Americas, for example, from Gyrocarpus hababensis and G. americanus, appear to be due to marine intrusions in the past.
The family originated in the coastal laurel forests of Gondwana, which is the main factor in its pattern of distribution. The Hernandiaceae inhabit montane tropical forests, some species living 4,000 m above sea level, but most species are more frequently found in low-altitude rainforests. Some deciduous species have adapted to demanding conditions in semiarid climates; they tend to depend on favorable, perennial or transient, edaphic conditions. Examples of such conditions include perennial aquifers, periodic groundwater flows, or periodically flooded forests in sand substrates containing very low levels of nutrients.
Flowers and fruit
The plants can have unisexual flowers (dioecious) or be monoecious. The inflorescence forms groups of small flowers in regular cymes. They present as the non-reproductive part of the flower (perianth) with a different corolla and calyx. Androecial members do not belong of the perianth and keeps in liberty of other, single-whorled. The pollen-producing reproductive organ (androecium) is only in fertile stamens. It also includes a variation which form of 1–2 nectariferous glands outside the stamens, the including staminodes. Staminodes in exterior to the stamens viable to reproduction (3–5); de sepals are opposite alternating with the inner perianth whorl (oppositisepalous). The anthers have dehiscing longitudinal valves. The wall of anther in seed of two cotyledons only one type. The pollen grains do not have aperture, constituted by 2 cells. The ovule production is given by gynoecium of one carpel, which are reduced in number related to the perianth. The pistil has only one ovule, the Gynoecium is also monomerous with only one carpel in inferior side. The placentation seems to be in an apex. The ovules form a testa from the outer integument (bitegmic), inverted so that the micropyle faces the placenta (anatropous), with two or more cell layers between the megasporophyte and the epidermal cells (crassinucellate) and pendulous. The endosperm formation is always from cells.
The fruit in some species is not fleshy with carpel indehiscent, seem to be with wings or included in an bloomed envelope derived from connate bracteoles. The seed without endosperm has two cotyledons with the appearance of flesh, oil producing, soft). The embryo is straight.
Uses
In Samoa some species are used in traditional herbal medicine for a variety of uses, and one type is a piscicide.
Among the chemical compounds isolated from the family Hernandiaceae, the alkaloid corytuberine is the oldest known compound. Later, its derivative O,O-dimethylcorytuberine was reported from several Hernandia species, including H. nymphaeifolia. Actinodaphnine and hernandion, were the earliest chemical compounds reported from the family Hernandiaceae respectively.

Sir Bernard Caulfield (24 April 1914 – 17 October 1994) was a British barrister and High Court judge who served in the Queen's Bench Division from 1968 to 1989. Known for his verbal floridness in court, he is perhaps best remembered for presiding over Jeffrey Archer's libel action against the Daily Star in 1987, which later led to Archer's conviction and imprisonment for perjury.
Early life and legal career
Bernard Caulfield was the youngest son of Dr John Caulfield, a GP in St Helens, and Catherine Quinn. He was educated at St Francis Xavier's College, Liverpool and Liverpool University, graduating with a LLB in 1938 and a LLM in 1940, qualifying as a solicitor the same year. He was called up for military service the same year, and served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, reaching the rank of Major. On returning to civilian life in 1946, he transferred to the Bar, and he was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1947. He joined the Midland Circuit in 1949 and was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1961.
Caulfield was Recorder of Coventry from 1963 to 1968 and Leader of the Midland Circuit from 1965 to 1968.
Judicial career
Caulfield was appointed to the High Court of Justice in 1968 on the recommendation of Lord Gardiner, the Labour lord chancellor and a close colleague at the Bar, with whom he is thought to have shared political sympathies. He received the customary knighthood the same year and was assigned to the Queen's Bench Division. He spent almost his entire judicial career on circuit, mostly on the Northern Circuit, of which he was the presiding judge from 1976 to 1980. His infrequent London sittings were thought to be a major factor in foreclosing promotion to the Court of Appeal.
On the bench, Caulfield was famous for his florid language, particularly in summing-ups.
Archer libel trial
In 1987 he tried Jeffrey Archer's libel action against tabloid the Daily Star, which ran a story alleging Archer had paid for sex with the prostitute Monica Coghlan. The description Caulfield gave of Mrs Archer in his summing-up speech to the jury, heavily in favour of Archer, acquired a certain notoriety: Remember Mary Archer in the witness-box. Your vision of her probably will never disappear. Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? Would she have, without the strain of this trial, radiance? How would she appeal? Has she had a happy married life? Has she been able to enjoy, rather than endure, her husband Jeffrey? The judge then went on to say of Jeffrey Archer: Is he in need of cold, unloving, rubber-insulated sex in a seedy hotel round about quarter to one on a Tuesday morning after an evening at the Caprice?Explaining the payment to Coghlan as the action of a philanthropist rather than that of a guilty man, Archer won the case and was awarded £500,000 damages, but in July 2001 was convicted of perjury in relation to the evidence he gave at the trial. He received four years in prison. Caulfield was spared the embarrassment of seeing this, having died in October 1994.
Other notable trials
Among his other notable cases, in 1984 he tried he burglar and rapist Malcolm Fairley at St Albans Crown Court. Describing Fairley as "a decadent advertisement for evil pornographers", Caulfield gave him six life sentences.

Annie Walker Armstrong (July 11, 1850 – December 20, 1938) was a lay Southern Baptist denominational leader instrumental in the founding of the Woman's Missionary Union.
Early life
Annie Armstrong was born in Baltimore, Maryland to tobacconist John Dunn Armstrong and his wife Mary Elizabeth (Walker) Armstrong. She also had a brother named James. She came from a long line of prominent Baptists including her great-great-grandfather Henry Sater who helped establish the first Baptist church in Maryland.
At the age of 20, she accepted Christ as her Savior under the preaching of Dr. Richard Fuller at Seventh Baptist Church (now Seventh Metro Church). It was there that she had a "born again" experience and was equipped to be a missionary. Later, she was among 100 Seventh Baptist Church members who established Eutaw Place Church (now Woodbrook Baptist Church). The church was pastored by Richard Fuller, the third president of the Southern Baptist Convention, who was heavily involved in missionary activities.
She worked with various Baltimore missionary organizations ministering to orphans, African Americans, Native Americans, Chinese Americans immigrants, and indigent women and families.
Woman's Missionary Union
In 1888, Armstrong led the creation of the Woman's Missionary Union, helping draft the constitution and serving as its first correspondent secretary (a position that functioned as executive director).
In her role as the head of the organization, Annie Armstrong facilitated communication between denominational leaders, local congregations and missionaries on the field. She was an extensive letter writer, handwriting 18,000 letters in one year alone.
During her tenure as head of the WMU, Armstrong refused a salary and traveled extensively at her own expense on behalf of the WMU. Annie was a tireless advocate for missionaries rallying the churches to support mission work through prayer and sacrificial giving. She personally visited missionaries serving throughout the U.S. and carried their stories back to the churches and state conventions through her eyewitness accounts and by circulating their letters. It was due to the efforts of Annie and the women of WMU that the annual Easter mission offering was established in the Southern Baptist Churches in 1895.
Controversies and conflicts
Annie retired from WMU in 1906. It was through the steely determination of Annie and many other like-minded Southern Baptist women that WMU had been forged against often fierce opposition from the male SBC leadership. The mid to late 1800s were times when public female leadership was virtually unknown. Throughout Annie's career she had successfully gained a growing SBC support due to her Christ-like passion and record for achieving results. Yet, controversy had remained as her intentions and decisions were at times questioned, misunderstood and publicly aired in various Baptist state newspapers.
In the early 1900s as WMU was continuing to evolve as an organization, there were conflicts over the path forward. To Annie, it seemed her days in leadership were now over precipitating her abrupt decision to step down. She remained very active in her local congregation and in extensive missions work in the city of Baltimore for the remainder of her life.
In 1934, WMU recognized her lifetime of work by naming the annual Easter offering for home missions in her honor. Thus, the Annie Armstrong Easter Offering was born with every dollar going to support missions work throughout the U.S. and Canada.
Death and legacy
Annie Armstrong died on December 20, 1938, in Baltimore, the year the WMU celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. She was buried in historic Green Mount Cemetery, with her parents and elder siblings. She has been inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame, and Southern Baptist churches continue to annually collect the Easter Offering for North American Missions in her name.

Michaux State Forest is a Pennsylvania State Forest in Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry District #1. The main offices are located in Fayetteville in Franklin County, Pennsylvania, USA.
The Michaux State Forest is in several tracts covering more than located in Adams County, southern Cumberland County, eastern Franklin County, and northwestern York County.
History
Michaux State Forest is named for André Michaux, a French botanist. He was dispatched in 1785 by King Louis XVI of France and his Queen Marie Antoinette to gather plants for the Royal Gardens.
Michaux State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to-late 19th century. Conservationists such as Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. They clear-cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since that had depleted the natural resources of the forests. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of "unseated lands for forest reservations." This was the beginning of the State Forest system.
The land that is now Michaux State Forest was once owned by several large iron companies. The iron companies used the old growth forests of South Central Pennsylvania to fire their iron furnaces such as Pine Grove Furnace, Caledonia, and Mont Alto. Colliers gathered the wood and created charcoal by slowly burning the logs in massive charcoal kilns that dotted the landscape of what is now Michaux State Forest.
Michaux State Forest is the location of several "firsts" in Pennsylvania Forestry. The first state nursery was established at Mont Alto in 1902. Rothrock opened the first forestry school in Pennsylvania and the second in the United States at what is now Penn State Mont Alto. Michaux State Forest saw the first wooden fire tower in 1905 as well as the first steel fire tower in 1914.
Michaux State Forest is now a thriving second growth forest. It is open to recreational hunting, fishing, hiking and mountain biking. It is crossed by the Appalachian Trail. Remnants of the charcoal days can still be seen in the state forest as the land where the kilns burned for so many years has yet to fully recover. Visitors to the park will notice these areas as large grassy meadows that are surrounded by the woods of Michaux State Forest.

Donald James Tarr (11 March 1910 – 4 June 1980) was a Welsh international hooker who played club rugby for Swansea and Cardiff, county rugby for Hampshire and invitational rugby for the Barbarians. Tarr was a career naval officer, reaching the rank of Lieutenant Commander in the Royal Navy.
Rugby career
Tarr began his rugby career as a school boy, representing the Welsh Secondary Schools team. In the 1927 secondary school game against France, Tarr was one of seven Welsh players that would later represent their country at senior level. Tarr joined Cardiff in 1931 and soon found himself in the squad to face the touring South African team. In 1933 Tarr joined Swansea alongside one of his school boys teammates, Claude Davey, and both lined up for Swansea against the touring New Zealand team in 1935. Both men were last minute substitutes, as Tarr was a replacement for the injured Tom Day and Davey was brought from Sale to cover for Idwal Rees. When Swansea beat the All Blacks, they became the first club team to beat all three major Southern Hemisphere teams. Tarr would face the same touring All Blacks another two times at club level; the Combined Services team at Aldershot and a joint Hampshire/Sussex county team.
Later in 1935, Tarr was selected to face the same touring New Zealand team, but this time for Wales. This was Tarr's one and only cap for the senior team because of an injury so serious that rugby journalist Huw Richards would say in 2010 that Tarr "probably came closer to dying on the pitch than anyone else ever has in an international match." With ten minutes of the match remaining, a loose scrum broke up to reveal Tarr laying motionless on the ground, and the referee, Cyril Gadney, called for a stretcher. Gadney ensured no-one moved Tarr before medical aid arrived and Tarr was lifted still face down onto the stretcher and was removed from the pitch. This action is thought to have saved his life as Tarr had suffered a broken neck. Although Wales were 12-10 down at the time, and now a man light, they recovered strongly and after Rees-Jones scored a try, Idwal Rees kept a strong defence to allow Wales a 13–12 victory.
Tarr's injury kept him from ever playing again for Wales, although he is recorded to have played one match post-injury for Ammanford. In a coincidence, his opposite number at hooker in his only appearance for Wales, Bill Hadley, was born on the same day as Tarr.

An electric generator or electric motor consists of a rotor spinning in a magnetic field. The magnetic field may be produced by permanent magnets or by field coils. In the case of a machine with field coils, a current must flow in the coils to generate the field, otherwise no power is transferred to or from the rotor. The process of generating a magnetic field by means of an electric current is called excitation. Field coils yield the most flexible form of magnetic flux regulation and de-regulation, but at the expense of a flow of electric current. Hybrid topologies exist, which incorporate both permanent magnets and field coils in the same configuration. The flexible excitation of a rotating electrical machine is employed by either brushless excitation techniques or by the injection of current by carbon brushes (static excitation).
Excitation in generators
For a machine using field coils, as is the case in most large generators, the field must be established by a current in order for the generator to produce electricity. Although some of the generator's own output can be used to maintain the field once it starts up, an external source of current is needed for starting the generator. In any case, it is important to be able to control the field since this will maintain the system voltage.
Amplifier principle
Except for permanent magnet generators, a generator produces output voltage proportional to the magnetic flux, which is the sum of flux from the magnetization of the structure and the flux proportional to the field produced by the excitation current. If there is no excitation current the flux is tiny and the armature voltage is almost nil.
The field current controls the generated voltage allowing a power system's voltage to be regulated to remove the effect of increasing armature current causing increased voltage drop in the armature winding conductors. In a system with multiple generators and a constant system voltage the current and power delivered by an individual generator is regulated by the field current. A generator is a current to voltage, or transimpedance amplifier. To avoid damage from progressively larger over-corrections, the field current must be adjusted more slowly than the effect of the adjustment propagates through the power system.
Separate excitation
For large, or older, generators, it is usual for a separate exciter dynamo to be powered in parallel with the main power generator. This is a small permanent-magnet or battery-excited dynamo that produces the field current for the larger generator.
Self excitation
Modern generators with field coils are usually self-excited; i.e., some of the power output from the rotor is used to power the field coils. The rotor iron retains a degree of residual magnetism when the generator is turned off. The generator is started with no load connected; the initial weak field induces a weak current in the rotor coils, which in turn creates an initial field current, increasing the field strength, thus increasing the induced current in the rotor, and so on in a feedback process until the machine "builds up" to full voltage.
Starting
Self-excited generators must be started without any external load attached. External load will sink the electrical power from the generator before the capacity to generate electrical power can increase.
Variants
Multiple versions of self-exitation exist:
a shunt, the simplest design, uses the main winding for the excitation power;
an excitation boost system (EBS) is a shunt design with a separate small generator added to temporarily provide an energy boost when the main coil voltage drops (for example, due to a fault). The boost generator is not rated for permanent operation;
an auxiliary winding is not connected to the main one and thus is not subject to voltage changes caused by the change of the load.
Field flashing
If the machine does not have enough residual magnetism to build up to full voltage, usually a provision is made to inject current into the field coil from another source. This may be a battery, a house unit providing direct current, or rectified current from a source of alternating current power. Since this initial current is required for a very short time, it is called field flashing. Even small portable generator sets may occasionally need field flashing to restart.
The critical field resistance is the maximum field circuit resistance for a given speed with which the shunt generator would excite. The shunt generator will build up voltage only if field circuit resistance is less than critical field resistance. It is a tangent to the open circuit characteristics of the generator at a given speed.
Brushless excitation
Brushless excitation creates the magnetic flux on the rotor of electrical machines without the need of carbon brushes. It is typically used for reducing the regular maintenance costs and to reduce the risk of brush-fire. It was developed in the 1950s, as a result of the advances in high-power semiconductor devices. The concept was using a rotating diode rectifier on the shaft of the synchronous machine to harvest induced alternating voltages and rectify them to feed the generator field winding.
Brushless excitation has been historically lacking the fast flux de-regulation, which has been a major drawback. However, new solutions have emerged. Modern rotating circuitry incorporates active de-excitation components on the shaft, extending the passive diode bridge. Moreover, their recent developments in high-performance wireless communication have realized fully controlled topologies on the shaft, such as the thyristor rectifiers and chopper interfaces.

Ultimate Rush is a 2011/2012 documentary television series produced by the Red Bull Media House in association with Matchstick Productions, and marketed as a combination of stupendous action sports endeavour, coupled with a cinematic-approach to storytelling. Through its wide distribution in the United States, the UK, Brazil, Denmark, Austria and other territories, the series is evidence of the acceptance of extreme sports into mainstream television, and one of the most complete accounts thereof. The series focuses on the outrageous exploits of some of the best athletes in the world, and how they explore the fine line between extreme sports, philosophy and art. Most of the filming was conducted in the rugged backcountry of British Columbia, Alaska, the Rocky Mountains, the French Alps, the Himalayas and the Andes, but not at official events or secured sites.
Seasons 1-3 of Ultimate Rush was written and co-executive produced by Pulitzer Prize-nominee and Hollywood screenwriter Stephen Schiff, whose other works include the films Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, True Crime, The Deep End of the Ocean and Lolita.
The 20 episodes of Season 1, Ultimate Rush were directed by Murray Wais and Steve Winter.
The narration was provided by the well-known veteran Hollywood actor, and three-time Academy Award-nominee, Nick Nolte. The series documented the exploits of several high-profile extreme sports stars including Chris Davenport, Hervé Cerutti, Steve Fisher - and the late, Antoine Montant and Shane McConkey.
Following the success of Season 1, Seasons 2-5 of Ultimate Rush featured narration by talented voice over actor, Sean Phillips, known also for his TV commercial and movie promo work, as well as several video game characters. With these subsequent seasons, Ultimate Rush went to even greater lengths to show audiences the thrills, dangers and colorful personalities of the extreme sports world.
Broadcast
Ultimate Rush premiered in December 2011 in German-speaking territories on Servus TV. The English-language version premiered in the United States on August 23, 2012 on Halogen TV, and was subsequently released on iTunes.

John Mills Houston (September 15, 1890 – April 29, 1975) was a member of the United States House of Representatives from the 5th congressional district of Kansas from 1935 to 1943. He was also a member of the National Labor Relations Board from 1943 to 1953, originally appointed by Franklin Roosevelt.
Early life and career
John Houston was born to Samuel J. and Sarah H. (Nieves) Houston on a farm near the small town of Formoso in Jewell County, Kansas, in September 1890. His father was a wealthy businessman who owned a lumberyard. He attended public school in Wichita, Kansas, from the first to fifth grade. He then entered St. John's Military School in Salina, Kansas, graduating in 1905 after two years. He graduated from Fairmount College (now known as Wichita State University) in Wichita, Kansas, in 1906, having focused on business administration.
From 1906 to 1912, he worked a series of odd jobs, but then became an actor on the theatrical stage with the Harry Frazee company. He was with the Frazee troupe from 1912 to 1917. At the outbreak of World War I, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, and was one of 19 men selected to act as President Woodrow Wilson's honor guard. He also served as a Marine guard at the State, War and Navy Building in Washington, D.C., and for a few months was the military orderly for United States Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels.
After the war, he returned to Kansas. He was manager of the Houston-Doughty Lumber Co. (the firm his father co-owned) from 1917 to 1935. During his tenure as manager of the firm, he also served a term as president of the Kansas Lumbermen's Association and as a member of the board of directors of the Kansas State Chamber of Commerce. He married Charlotte Stellhorn of St. Louis, Missouri, on May 28, 1919 (some sources say 1920). The couple had two children, Patricia (1922) and Robert (1925). Houston was elected mayor of Newton, Kansas, in 1927, serving two two-year terms. He was elected secretary of the Kansas Democratic State Central Committee in 1934, serving for a year. Houston was also active in the American Legion and in Freemasonry.
Congressional career
Houston was elected to the United States Congress by the voters of Kansas' 5th Congressional District in 1934. The incumbent, William Augustus Ayres, resigned from Congress on August 21, 1934, to accept an appointment to the Federal Trade Commission. Somewhat surprisingly, Houston easily defeated Republican Ira C. Watson 57 percent to 36.2 percent.
He won re-election two years later with 60 percent of the vote over Republican challenger J.B. Patterson. Houston barely defeated Republican Stanley Taylor in 1938, 43,990 to 43,480. In a rematch in 1940, Houston more handily defeated Taylor by a 5,500-vote margin (58,436 to 52,901).
During his tenure in Congress, Houston was a member of the House Committee on Appropriations.
The 1940 census led to redistricting which pitted Houston against Edward Herbert Rees, the incumbent Republican in Kansas' 4th congressional district. Rees easily defeated Houston, 55,612 to 44,333. Republican Clifford R. Hope, who had once held the 7th congressional district (it had been eliminated due to redistricting) won the new 5th district seat once held by Houston.
NLRB career
Houston's strong support for Roosevelt in Congress was rewarded when President Roosevelt appointed him on March 5, 1943, to succeed William M. Leiserson on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). His nomination was not well received. NLRB chairman Dr. Harry A. Millis had supported NLRB general counsel Robert B. Watts, and had urged Roosevelt repeatedly to appoint someone with extensive credentials in labor relations (which Houston lacked). Roosevelt also passed over Lloyd K. Garrison, Dean of the University of Wisconsin Law School and former chair of the National Labor Board (NLB) in the early 1930s; Dr. George W. Taylor, vice chairman of the National War Labor Board and a former NLB regional director; and Edward C. Witte, a noted professor of labor relations at the University of Wisconsin.
Houston had no labor relations experience prior to his service on the NRLB. For the first several years of his first five-year term on the board, Houston relied heavily on his legal staff for advice. United States Department of Labor solicitor general Gerard D. Reilly was appointed to the NRLB in September 1942 to replace the departing Edwin S. Smith. Reilly was deeply conservative, and some staff members at the NLRB considered him reactionary. Reilly also had a great deal of influence on Houston during Houston's first few years in office. But as Houston gained experience, he forged an alliance with the NLRB's moderate chairman, Harry Millis, who was a firm believer in collective bargaining and labor unions. In his second five-year term on the NLRB, Houston became the most consistently pro-labor member of the board. Reilly came to believe that NLRB Chief Trial Examiner Frank Bloom (a left-wing lawyer) heavily influenced Houston in these later years.
Houston's renomination to the Board proved to be something of a watershed. In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act expanded the NLRB's size from three to five members. President Harry S. Truman had appointed one relatively liberal and one relatively conservative member to the Board after the Act's passage. Houston was renominated for the NLRB on April 12, 1948. His renomination was seen as something of a restoration of a "New Deal" (e.g., liberal) coalition on the NLRB, one which would interpret federal labor law more expansively and in favor of labor unions.
Houston was involved in several important votes during his tenure on the NRLB. Almost immediately after joining the board, he allied with Chairman Millis in voting to overturn a previous decision of the NLRB and deny plant foremen the right to join unions (as they were supervisors and not employees). But just two years later, he and Millis allied again to overturn their 1943 decision. Houston and new NLRB Chairman Paul M. Herzog again combined in 1946 to uphold the 1945 decision. In 1945, he again allied with Millis to force the resignation of Charles T. Douds, the board's controversial and liberal Northeast regional director. In 1947, he was embroiled along with the Board in a major dispute over the Taft-Hartley Act. The Act had become law over President Truman's veto in the summer of 1947, and among its many provisions was a requirement that all elected union leaders file an affidavit with the NLRB asserting that they were not now and never had been a member of the Communist Party USA and that they disavowed any future attempt to overthrow the United States government by force. The question before the NLRB was whether this applied to union leaders who were elected not to sit on the executive board of their home union but to serve on the board of directors of some other federation, organization, or body. The NLRB's general counsel ruled that members of the boards of directors of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations must sign these oaths. This was a concern, since many of these individuals had been communists in their youth (although they were no longer). Since they did not hold elected positions on their home unions, they had escaped the Taft-Hartley Act's anti-communist oath provisions, but the general counsel's ruling put their service in jeopardy. Houston, along with three other members of the NLRB overruled the general counsel in a series of votes in September and October 1947.
Retirement and death
Houston retired from the NLRB on August 27, 1953. Having divorced his first wife Charlotte, Houston married Ireta Robinson on November 16, 1945.
Houston moved to Laguna Beach, California. He died there April 29, 1975, after suffering a heart attack. He is interred in Melrose Abbey Cemetery, Anaheim, California.

Charis Ursula Frankenburg (née Barnett; 9 February 1892 – 5 April 1985) was a British author, one of the first women eligible for a degree from the University of Oxford, a founder of one of the first birth control clinics in England outside London, and a member of The Mutual Admiration Society.
Early life and education
Charis Barnett was born on 9 February 1892 in Isleworth, London, the daughter of British educator Percy Barnett and his wife, Annie (née Beeching). After attending Bedales School, near Petersfield, and St Paul's Girls' School, Hammersmith, she began her studies at Somerville College, Oxford in 1912, where she met Dorothy L. Sayers, but was prevented from completing them by the outbreak of World War I. Instead she became a midwife and nurse, and worked in the maternity hospital of Châlons-sur-Marne. She was awarded a "war degree" from Oxford.
Charity activities
On 19 February 1918, she married Sydney Solomon Frankenburg (1881–1935), an army captain who was her cousin. They had four children. After they moved to near Salford, in the north-west of England, where his family business was located, Charis Frankenburg took up various local charitable roles. She became particularly active in the field of maternity care, focusing at first on the importance of midwives who had received adequate training. In 1922 she published Common Sense in the Nursery. She became interested in educating working-class women about birth control methods, and in 1926 co-founded the Manchester, Salford and District Mothers' Clinic with her schoolfriend Mary Stocks, after seeking advice from Marie Stopes. The clinic only served women who were already mothers.
In 1938, a few years after being widowed, Frankenburg became a Salford Justice of the Peace, and worked in the juvenile court. She returned to London in the 1950s, retaining her Salford JP position. There she chaired the Public Health and Child Welfare Committee of the National Council of Women and also served as vice-chair of its Public Service and Magistrates Committee; in the early 1960s, the latter committee worked to reform laws on jury service so that all women could serve.
She retired in 1967, and published her autobiography, Not Old, Madam, Vintage in 1975. She died on 5 April 1985 at Newbury, Berkshire.

Serbia Fashion Week is a fashion show held twice a year in Novi Sad, Serbia. Occurring in April and November, the event attracts local and international fashion designers, such as Thierry Mugler and Anna Fendi. In addition to runway shows, seminars and exhibits, the "Fashion Talent Design Competition" helps promote young Serbian designers by showcasing their collections. The seven day festival also highlights the works of applied artists, musicians, interior decorators, multimedia experts and architects.
The fashion show portion is often held at the Congress Centre Master of the Novi Sad Fair, a multi-functional venue situated near the center of the city. Other locations are used as well, for the opening shows, concerts, and art exhibits. Each year, about 30,000 visitors attend with approximately 60 fashion designers, from 20 different countries, presenting their collections.
About
Partially sponsored by the municipal government, Serbia Fashion Week was founded in 2013 by current head Svetlana Horvat. Having worked as a womenswear designer, she is also the current president of the National Serbian Chamber of Fashion.
On October 31, 2013, Horvat made the fashion week official by signing the "Protocol on Cooperation" with the national Fashion Councils of eight other European countries.
The event's main objective is to present Serbian talent alongside designers from established European fashion capitals. Other goals include encouraging the local textile and manufacturing industries, as well as promoting tourism in the area.
Highlights
SFW 2013
The very first Serbia Fashion Week took place from October 31 to November 2, 2013. It featured designers from Serbia, the Netherlands, Hungary, Bulgaria, among others. French designer Eymeric François opened the show and Marcellous L. Jones, owner of "Fashion Insider TV", acted as adviser for the event. Two main themes defined the festival, High Fashion and Urban Fashion, with runway shows held at locations such as the Assembly of Vojvodina. A conference on fashion branding also took place at the assembly building. About 2,500 visitors attended the first festival in 2013. As part of the "Designer Exchange" program, local talent Biljana Tipsarević was later able to represent Serbia at Malta Fashion Week.
SFW 2014
The special guest of honour, at the October 2014 edition, was Maastricht mayor, Onno Hoes, who participated in the Fashion Educational Conference Series.

Islas Secas (translation: 'Dry Islands'), a luxury resort set on a 14-island archipelago in the Gulf of Chiriquí on the Pacific coast of Panama, launched in December 2018. It is located 33 nautical miles from the town of Punta Tierra, Chorcha.
Islas Secas comprises eight ‘Casitas' sleeping up to 18 guests on one of the islands. Each Casita is surrounded by the island's tropical forest. The archipelago is an eco-destination, with strong eco-reserve credentials powered by 100% solar-generated energy. It is near Coiba National Park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and its waters are visited twice a year by two different populations of migrating humpback whales.
Islas Secas is currently owned by American investor and conservationist philanthropist Louis Bacon, who supports efforts to protect natural resources in the United States and beyond.
Islas Secas was previously privately owned by American entrepreneur Michael Klein, who constructed the original eco-resort on the islands, prior to his death on a flight from the islands to view Volcán Barú.

The Carpenter House is a historic house at 89 Carpenter Street in Rehoboth, Massachusetts. The two-story wood-frame house was probably built in 1789 by Thomas Carpenter III, reusing elements of an older (c. 1750) structure that is known to have stood at the site. The house is one of several locally distinctive houses designed with kitchen fireplaces on both floors. It remained in the Carpenter family until 1900.
The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

AE Aquarii is a cataclysmic variable binary star of the DQ Herculis type. Based upon parallax measurements, the system is located at a distance of about from the Earth. Because of its unique properties, this system has been subject to a number of scientific studies. The white dwarf in the AE Aquarii system is the first star of its type known to give off pulsar-like pulsations that are powered by its rotation and particle acceleration.
The AE Aquarii system consisting of an ordinary star in a close orbit around a magnetic white dwarf; the pair orbit each other with a period of 9.88 hours. The white dwarf primary has 63% of the Sun's mass but a radius of only about 1% of the Sun. As of 2009, it has the shortest known spin period of any white dwarf, completing a full revolution every 33.08 seconds. This spin is decreasing at a rate of 1.78 ns per year, which is unusually high. The secondary star has a stellar classification of K4-5 V, making it a main sequence star that is generating energy at its core through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen. It has about 37% of the Sun's mass but 79% of the Sun's radius.
This system displays flare activity that has been observed across multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, including X-rays. Mass is being lost from the secondary star, most of which is being flung out of the system by the rapidly spinning magnetic primary. The X-ray luminosity is likely being caused by the accretion of mass onto the white dwarf, which is occurring at an estimated rate of about per second.

The Mbombela Stadium is a football and Rugby union all-seater stadium in Mbombela in the Mpumalanga province of South Africa was built for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, It was one of 10 venues for the tournament and one of 5 newly constructed stadiums. It is the home ground for the Pumas. It is an all-seater stadium, with 43,500-seats, almost all under roof.
It is located 6 kilometres west of Mbombela, the capital of the Mpumalanga province and is the largest venue in the province. The R1,050-million facility was ready for use well ahead of the June 2010 World Cup kickoff and was funded entirely through central government taxpayer funding, requiring no financing by the city.
Construction
Construction commenced in February 2007 and was completed in November 2009. The construction contract was awarded to a South African–French consortium of Basil Read Construction and Bouygues.
The structure is founded on 1,500 piles on a 10m structural grid. Each roof support (in the shape of a giraffe) sits on 18 piles on the 30m major structural bay. The 10m span seating beams are prestressed and most of the 3,170 units were pre-cast on site.
The project was subjected to numerous wildcat strikes. With the 5th and final strike, all main contract labourers were dismissed. All subsequent work was performed by subcontractors.
During a freak storm in January 2009, a tower crane blew over and cut through the partially completed roof. The site was unoccupied at the time and there were no injuries. The construction required a total of 5.5 million man-hours to complete.
The site accident history was exceptionally safe with the worst injury being a broken ankle. A record was set of 2.4 million consecutive injury-free hours.
Design
The stadium design reflects its inter-relation with the nearby Kruger National Park. The signature feature of the stadium are the 18 roof supports that resemble giraffes. The seats are patterned with zebra stripes. Visitors to the venue can easily add on a side-trip to the game reserve.
Seating
The bowl design aimed to put every seat as close as practical to the field action and maintain excellent sightlines over the heads of spectators. This venue is the most compact arena of all 2010 venues. Most seats 95% are covered by the cantilever roof.
The seating capacity is 43,500. In FIFA WC configuration it seated 40,929 with regular seats lost to the media tribune. The seating is divided into 3 tiers with 21,000 lower tiers, 3,500 middle tiers and 19,000 on the upper tier. The upper tier is accessed by 8 wide ramps located on the corners. The ramps accommodate small delivery vehicles. The middle tier, which is accessed by elevators, has premium seating with a VIP lounge, restaurant, club lounges and 25 private boxes.
Pitch
The pitch is sized for association football (105x68m) and Rugby Union (100x70m). It is floodlit to 2,200 lux to meet FIFA requirements which is on full backup power from diesel generators. The cool season rye grass pitch grown from seed is reinforced with Desso GrassMaster artificial turf fibres which anchor the field, creating what is essentially a semi-synthetic pitch for a stable and a level grass surface and has no problem standing up to extreme abuse during a rugby scrum.
The pitch was the cause of great concern and some ridicule 5 months before the World Cup, but its perfect performance in its first real test on 16 May 2010 silenced the critics.
The selection of rye grass was a directive from FIFA specifically for the World Cup. It is not an ideal grass type for the very hot and humid summer conditions common in Mbombela. In January 2013 an unfortunate and unusual long spell of unbroken rainy and weather caused a grass fungus which killed off most of the grass in the run-up to the 2013 African Cup of Nations. Concerns were raised over the playing surface with Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor describing it as "sandy" and "a disgrace". He went on to say "At the end of the day we are all African and we have to be honest with ourselves. It's a beautiful stadium but the pitch is not happening".
Subsequent to the pitch failure of AFCON 2013 during summer cynodon is grown which provides a robust and dependable surface during the hot climate. The cynodon is dormant in winter when the rye grass flourishes.
Roof
The 1,450 tonne roof covers an area of 22,500 square metres and 94% of the seats. At 55 kg/sqm its super lightweight efficient design kept roof cost in check and meant almost all seats are under roof. The roof is 35m above the pitch. Half of the roof is translucent to maximise sunlight to the pitch and to lighten the seating bowl. The roof appears to float above the top of the seating bowl with an 8 m gap to provide ventilation in the hot climate and also to provide views to the surrounding hills from the seats.
The structure is a propped cantilever on a 30 m module with the steel towers for the tension rods doubling as symbolic giraffe necks. The floor of the service catwalk is 110mm thick concrete acting as ballast to resist wind uplift.
Controversies and corruption
Allegations of corruption relating to the awarding of construction contracts in the building of the stadium plagued the project. At least three individuals were murdered in connection with the allegations, and another three have died under mysterious circumstances.
Assassination
The Speaker of the Mbombela Council, Jimmy Mohlala had been a longstanding and vocal critic of corruption in the province. In late 2008 Mohlala began legal steps to cancel the Lefika Emerging Equity design contract for the new stadium based on a fraudulent tax clearance certificate submitted as part their design tender document. He called for a criminal case against soccer boss Bobby Motaung for reportedly forging a Mbombela council letter with a fake signature of former Mbombela municipal manager Sgananda Siboza to obtain an overdraft from a bank. Shortly after taking these steps, in January 2009, Mohlala was brutally assassinated outside his residence in front of his son. Allegations have been made repeatedly that Bobby Motaung and David Mabuza organised the murder of Mohlala. David Mabuza was Premier of the Mpumalanga Province at the time and is now Deputy President of South Africa. For more detailed investigative journalistic accounts around his death read the online articles:.
Corruption
Cancellation of the Design Contract
Lefika Emerging Equity won the design contract for the stadium in April 2006. Lefika was composed of three businessmen. Bobby Motaung, manager of Kaiser Chiefs football club, Herbert Theledi, a businessman with powerful provincial connections, and Chris Grib, a minority shareholder in Lefika and CEO tasked with day-to-day running of the company. Chris Grib left the country in late 2008 under a cloud when it came to light that the SA Revenue Services tax clearance document required to win the design contract was fraudulent. After Jimmy Mohlala was assassinated weeks after he attempted to cancel the design contract, the balance of the construction till completion proceeded with Lefika effectively absent, but still earning their professional fees. No officials were brave enough to continue attempts to cancel the design contract.
Arrests
Despite their wrongdoings being widely reported, Lefika enjoyed political protection by the provincial ANC under the leadership of premier David Mabuza and the Jacob Zuma-faction who reportedly suppressed the powerful evidence against Lefika and blocked legal prosecution against them for three years. On 15 August 2012, all three Lefika directors were arrested for tender fraud related to the stadium's design contract by the Special Investigations Unit, known as the Hawks, an independent national investigations unit. All three were released on bail and returned to court on 15 October 2012. Chris Grib was out of the country when Jimmy Mohlala was murdered and when Lefika forged a document on a Municipal letter head used to apply for a R1 million overdraft from Nedbank so he was expected to testify against his co-directors Motaung and Theledi under a plea deal for a lesser sentence. The case was heard but charges later dropped. In January 2016 the case was re-investigated and the reinstatement of charges was being considered by the National Prosecuting Authority however nothing came of this. By July 2016 the case was struck off the roll due to a lack of evidence among talk of Bobby Motaung intimidating witnesses from testifying. In November 2017 the National Prosecuting Authority announced that the fraud case would no longer be pursued for lack of evidence. The dropping of charges were reportedly due to Zuma-faction members within the National Prosecuting Authority suppressing the evidence.
Municipality placed under Administration
Corruption related to general municipal mismanagement and the construction of the stadium resulted in the provincial government taking over the running of the municipality and construction management. The Municipality was placed under administration in June 2007. When the Mbombela Municipality was reinstated 5 months later, the outspoken new mayor Lassie Chiwayo and council officials reportedly received death threats, warning them to remain silent about the evidence of corruption.
Lowest cost new 2010 stadium
Although the stadium is widely known for corruption it is ironic that the stadium became a model in terms of the lowest total cost. Mbombela Stadium stands out as being the lowest-cost new 2010 stadium by quite a large margin and the highest ratio of seats under roof.
Corruption was reported about other World Cup-related contracts, however the stadium construction itself proceeded without any controversy. Attempted manipulation of stadium construction sub-contracts by Lefika was successfully blocked by principled officials within the Municipality and the Project Manager.
The worst erroneous spending that has come to light was a very expensive sod turning ceremony costing more than R2 million, and a R590,000 invoices for a business plan that was inflated to R2.4 million by Lefika, with payment forced through by the municipal manager Jacob Dladla. It was reported that an expensive car was purchased as a gift for Dladla at the time. He was arrested on related charges in October 2012 and released on bail.
Local community
Promises of improvements to Mattafin, the impoverished surrounding township have not been fulfilled. Students from the local primary and high schools had to be relocated to container classrooms and the old schools used by the General Contractor. It took multiple violent protests to get the authorities to finally build the new schools 3 years after they were promised. The land belonging to the Matsafeni trust was secretly sold for R1 by Mattafin community leaders to the Mbombela Local Municipality for the new stadium in exchange for other rights. The sale was set aside three years later when the community launched a legal challenge and reinstated with a market related price.
Wetland
To make way for a replacement school, a wetland was bulldozed, but no environmental impact assessment was done before the wetland was destroyed.
Tournament results
2010 FIFA World Cup
2013 African Cup of Nations
Inaugural game
On 16 May 2010, the stadium was officially opened with an international friendly match between South Africa and Thailand. South Africa won 4–0, leading 3–0 at half time.
After the World Cup
The stadium has been managed since after the World Cup, under contract, by Platinum Sport Consulting. Because it is the only large venue in the province it has had high utililisation in contrast to expectations that it would not serve much purpose after the World Cup.
Rugby at the stadium
The Pumas are the main rugby tenants. They will play all Currie Cup matches at the stadium, while most Vodacom Cup matches will be played at Puma Stadium.
The stadium held its first rugby match on 27 August 2010. The Pumas hosted the Blue Bulls in a 2010 Currie Cup match. Pumas won 22–21, trailing 10–11 at half time.
The Pumas made use of the stadium again, when they hosted Western Province on 17 September 2010. Western Province won the match 62–10.
The country's national team, popularly known as the Springboks, played their first match at the stadium against Scotland on 15 June 2013. This match was the second half of a doubleheader, with the curtain-raiser being a matchup between Samoa and Italy. The two composed the second round of a one-off four-team tournament that served partly as a warm-up for the Boks' 2013 Rugby Championship campaign.
South Africa hosted at the stadium on 21 June 2014 in the second test of Wales' 2014 South African tour. The Springboks won the match 31–30.
The Boks played Argentina at the stadium on 20 August 2016. The Springboks won 30-23.
The first time the All Blacks would play against the Boks at Mbombela Stadium was scheduled for 26 September 2020 but the game was cancelled due the COVID-19 pandemic. The rescheduled match was held on 6 August 2022, with South African winning 26-10.
Football (soccer)
The stadium was again used by South Africa when they beat Niger 2–0 on 4 September 2010, in a 2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.
On 14 November 2010, the stadium hosted its first Premier Soccer League match. Wits moved their match against Mamelodi Sundowns to the stadium.

Sphaerosyllis voluntariorum is a species belonging to the phylum Annelida, a group known as the segmented worms. This species is closely related to Sphaerosyllis bifurcata, Sphaerosyllis bifurcatoides and Sphaerosyllis rotundipapillata, all endemic species to Australia, characterized by having large dorsal papillae, sometimes trilobed, and with shafts of compound chaetae distally bifid. S. voluntariorum is more densely papillated on its anterior segments and has a long subdistal spine on the ventral simple chaetae. This species' name alludes to the volunteers of the Marine Invertebrate section of The Australian Museum, who sorted specimens of syllids that led to the description of this animal.
Description
The species' body is small, with a total length of and width of , including 26 chaetigers. It possesses numerous papillae on its dorsum and a few on its parapodia, and none on its prostomium and palps; the papillae are long, with trilobed tips and dark inclusions. Its prostomium is ovate, showing 4 large eyes in a trapezoidal arrangement. Its antennae are long, with bulbous bases and long tips, similar to the combined length of its prostomium and palps. The palps are similar in length than its prostomium, fused along their length, ventrally folded.
Its peristomium measures the same as its succeeding segments, covering the posterior half of the prostomium. Its tentacular cirri are shorter than its antennae, the dorsal cirri being the same length as the tentacular cirri, with slender tips. Its parapodial lobes are conical, with 2 subdistal papillae. Its ventral cirri are long and slender, while its parapodial glands are very small.
It shows anterior parapodia with 5 compound chaetae each, with unidentate blades. The blades of the dorsal compound chaetae possess marginal spines about 12µm long, while the blades of ventral compound chaetae are smooth, measuring about 9 µm long. Sphaerosyllis voluntariorum shows dorsal simple chaetae from chaetiger 1, unidentate with few spines. The ventral simple chaetae on posterior parapodia are smooth, sigmoid and distally hooked, provided with a long subdistal spine. Its parapodia count with a single acicula each, bent to a right angle.
The pharynx spans approximately 3 segments. Its pharyngeal tooth is probably located on its anterior rim. Its proventricle spans through 1 or 2 segments, with 12 muscle cell rows. Its pygidium is small, with numerous rounded papillae and 2 anal cirri, which are similar to its dorsal cirri but quite longer.
Distribution
S. voluntariorum was found in Cape Range National Park, Western Australia, at a depth of in mixed algae. Its distribution is thought to include the whole of WA.

The British C-class submarines were the last class of petrol engined submarines of the Royal Navy and marked the end of the development of the in the Royal Navy. Thirty-eight were constructed between 1905 and 1910 and they served through World War I.
With limited endurance and only a ten percent reserve of buoyancy over their surface displacement, they were poor surface vessels, but their spindle shaped hull made for good underwater performance compared to their contemporaries.
Service history
Three (C36, C37 and C38) had been sent to Hong Kong in 1911 and during the war the remainder were mainly used for coastal defence, based at the east coast ports of Leith, Harwich, Hartlepool, Grimsby and Dover, some operating with Q-ships which were decoying U-boats. The technique was for a trawler to tow the submarine and communicate with it by telephone. When a U-boat surfaced to attack the trawler with its deck gun, the British submarine would slip its tow and attempt to torpedo the U-boat.
, the first boat commissioned, was employed during the Zeebrugge raid on 23 April 1918. Packed with explosives it was blown up in an attempt to destroy a viaduct, for which her commander Lieutenant Richard Sandford was awarded the Victoria Cross.
Four operated in the Baltic Sea, based at Tallinn as part of the blockade of Germany trying to prevent the import of iron ore from Sweden. They were sent there in September 1915 via a tortuous route — towed around the North Cape to Arkhangelsk and taken by barge to Kronstadt. Three of these boats were destroyed (along with the British E-class submarines , , , ) outside Helsinki in 1918 to prevent capture by German troops of the Baltic Sea Division who had landed nearby.
Ten of the submarines were lost during the war, including which was mistakenly rammed by . The surviving boats were disposed of at the end of the war with the exception of , which was retained for trials until being scrapped in 1922.
The Imperial Japanese Navy also used their own version of the C class, which they had bought from Vickers, this was the , two almost-identical designs came from Ha-1, these were the and es.

38 C-class boats were built in total for the RN:

Northeastern Tasmanian, or Pyemmairre, is an aboriginal language of Tasmania.
It is identified in the reconstruction of Claire Bowern. It was spoken in the northeastern corner of the island.
Northeastern Tasmanian is attested from three word lists of Charles Robinson and George Augustus Robinson: From Cape Portland (366 words), Ben Lomond (195 words), and Pipers River (126 words). Bowern also includes the language of the Port Dalrymple vocabulary (125 words) collected by J.-P. Gaimard in the Tamar River region of the North Midlands; however, it is divergent, and Dixon & Crowley consider it to be a distinct language.
The name Pyemmairre may not include the highland people of Ben Lomond, for which Plangermaireener ("Plangamerina") has been used.

Pati Kremer (1867–1943) was a Russian revolutionary socialist and pioneer of the General Jewish Workers' Union in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (Bund). She was the wife of Arkadi Kremer.
Biography
Pati Kremer was born Matla Srednicki on 2 January 1867 in Vilna. She was the daughter of a wealthy merchant. In the 1880s she moved to St. Petersburg to study dentistry and there became involved with revolutionary political circles. She was also active in educational and literacy projects for workers. In 1889 she was arrested for the first time. Upon her release, she returned to Vilna, where she became a leading member and organizer of the Jewish Social-Democratic circle known as the 'Vilna Group', together with John Mill (1870–1952) and Arkadi Kremer (1865–1935). Pati and Arkadi were subsequently married.
The Vilna Group was one of the precursors of the Bund and of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP). Pati Kremer was arrested again in September 1897 and banished to Mogilev. There she resumed her activities on behalf of the Bund, working with other political exiles and local workers. In 1898 she secretly attended the second congress of the Bund in Kovno. In 1902, she and Arkadi (who had been arrested in 1898) escaped abroad, making their way to Britain, the USA, Switzerland and France. They mostly remained in France until 1921, becoming French citizens and working with the French Socialist Party as well as the Bund.
In 1921, the Kremers returned to Vilna, where Arkadi became chairman of the local branch of the Bund. Pati Kremer worked as editor and translator in the publishing house of Boris Kletskin (1875–1937), a Bundist. In 1935, her husband died, and she began work on a commemorative volume eventually published in New York in 1942. During the German occupation of Vilna in the Second World War she became a leading figure in the city's Jewish ghetto, organizing and maintaining secret Yiddish libraries and clandestine meetings of the Bund. When the Ghetto was razed by the Germans in September 1943, Pati Kremer was among the many victims who were rounded up, transported to the Sobibor extermination camp and murdered.

Aracruz is a municipality at the central coast of Espírito Santo, Brazil.
Location
Aracruz covers , and has a population of 103,101 with a population density of 66 inhabitants per square kilometer.
The municipality contains part of the Comboios Biological Reserve, a fully protected area.
The Santa Cruz Wildlife Refuge created in 2010 extends offshore from the municipality.
The coastline of the municipality is also protected in part by the Costa das Algas Environmental Protection Area, created in 2010.
History
The municipality's history begins in 1556, when two Jesuit priests (Braz Lourenço and Diogo Jácomo) founded Santa Cruz, a town then called Aldeia Nova (New Village). Aldeia Nova later became known as Aldeia Velha (Old Village), since it didn't prosper as much as its neighbour, which then became known as Aldeia Nova, and is today called Nova Almeida. Aldeia Velha became emancipated as a municipality in 1848, and changed its name to Santa Cruz. In 1943, the municipality and its capital were both renamed Aracruz. However, the biggest economic driver at the time was jacarandá wood, and Sauaçu held most of the wood processing plants (serrarias), so in 1948 the capital was moved to Sauaçu (also called Sauassu), and the capital's name went with it. Sauaçu then became known as Aracruz, and Aracruz reverted to its formal and present name, Santa Cruz.
Santa Cruz was founded at the mouth of the Piraquê-mirim and Piraquê-açu Rivers, as were a number of Amerindian tribes. After a visit from the Emperor Peter II who slept in Santa Cruz in 1860, he signed permission for 386 Italian families to settle in Santa Cruz, and those families founded Fazenda Nova Trento (New Trento Farm) around 1874. Other groups moved up the Piraquê-açu river to found Palmas Farm (Fazenda das Palmas) and Santa Teresa. At this time coffee and cassava plantations were common.
Another large wave of Italian immigrants began coming around 1872, when a ship called Sofia arrived bringing 386 Italians from the region of Trento. Those went on to found Nova Trento Colony.
Demographics
According to the IBGE population estimate for 2016, Aracruz is the tenth most populated municipality in Espírito Santo, with 96.746 residents.
Population
Today Aracruz is home to roughly 1500 Native Americans divided into six reservations: Caieiras Velha, Comboios, Irajá, Pau Brasil, Tekoá and Três Palmeiras. Only in the last couple of decades have they been able to secure their land here, as many problems with the local paper industry greatly prolonged their land struggles. Those Amerindians belong to two tribes: the Tupiniquim and the Guarani. The Native Americans in Aracruz Municipality no longer speak their native languages, but they hold on to their traditional subsistence farming and handcraft trade.

Visa requirements for New Zealand citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of New Zealand. New Zealand citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 186 countries and territories, ranking the New Zealand passport 6th in terms of travel freedom according to the Henley Passport Index.

Visa exemptions for Schengen states
A stay in the Schengen Area as a whole of up to 3 months
New Zealand citizens are classified as 'Annex II' foreign nationals, and so are permitted to stay visa-free in the 26 member states of the Schengen Area as a whole — rather than each country individually — for a period not exceeding 3 months every 6 months.
A stay in the Schengen Area as a whole of more than 3 months (but no more than 3 months in any individual member state)
The New Zealand Government has signed bilateral visa waiver agreements with a number of the individual countries who are Schengen signatories, which allow New Zealand citizens to spend up to three months in the relevant country, without reference to time spent in other Schengen signatory states. Since these agreements continue to remain valid despite the implementation of the Schengen agreement, the European Commission has confirmed that in practice if New Zealanders visit Schengen countries which have signed these types of bilateral agreements with New Zealand, then the terms of these agreements override the conditions normally imposed as a result of the Schengen visa exemption agreement.
New Zealand has individual bilateral visa waiver agreements with the following Schengen signatories:
Consequently, New Zealand citizens can visit the above Schengen member states visa-free for periods of up to 3 months in each country. If, however, a New Zealand citizen then visits another Schengen state not included in the list above, the restriction of no more than 3 months out of a 6-month period in the Schengen area as a whole applies. Therefore, if a New Zealand citizen has already spent 3 months in one or more of the above Schengen countries, any visits to another Schengen country without a bilateral visa waiver agreement with New Zealand may lead to difficulties with local law enforcement agencies (e.g. being accused of having overstayed upon leaving a Schengen country which is not in the list above).
In addition, a New Zealand citizen who has already spent up to 3 months in other parts of the Schengen Area can enter Hungary and remain there for up to a further 90 days visa-free. Following the stay in Hungary, if 3 months has already spent elsewhere in the Schengen area, he/she must then leave the Schengen area from Hungary and go directly to a country outside the Schengen Area.
A stay in the Schengen Area as a whole of more than 3 months (and more than 3 months in an individual member state)
In general, any person who is not a European Union, European Economic Area or Swiss citizen and who wishes to stay in a Schengen member state for more than 3 months is required to obtain a national long-stay 'D' visa and/or a residence permit. New Zealand citizens aged 18–30 (or 18–35 in some cases) are able to obtain a national long-stay 'D' visa and/or a residence permit from 19 Schengen member states on the basis of a working holiday (see below). Schengen member states also issue national long-stay 'D' visas and residence permits for other reasons to those fulfilling criteria laid out in their national immigration policies (e.g. skilled workers, students, au pair).
In general, the national long-stay 'D' visa/residence permit needs to be obtained in advance through the member state's embassy/consulate. However, some Schengen member states offer exceptions for New Zealand citizens.
allows New Zealand citizens to enter the country without a visa and to apply for a temporary residence permit or a 'Red-White-Red Card' (issued to permanent immigrants) after arrival, rather than in advance through an Austrian embassy/consulate.
The allows New Zealand citizens to apply for a work visa under a special scheme known as a 'Green Card' (rather than a 'Blue Card' or work permit which is required by most non-EU citizens). The application for a Green Card can be lodged at any Czech embassy/consulate (or, in some circumstances, within the Czech Republic if the applicant is already resident there) and is usually processed within 60 days.
As of 24 June 2014, it is no longer possible to apply for a green card. This type of permit was replaced
permits New Zealand citizens intending to stay in the country for over 3 months to enter Denmark without a visa and to apply for a residence or work permit (excluding a working holiday residence permit) after arrival (whilst for many other non-EEA and Swiss citizens, an application for a residence permit and visa for a stay over 3 months must be lodged in advance at a Danish foreign mission). This is particularly useful as there is no Danish embassy or consulate in New Zealand that accepts residence or work permit applications - the nearest one is in Canberra in Australia.
permits New Zealand citizens to stay and work in Estonia for more than 90 days but less than 6 months as long as they obtain a category 'D' long-stay visa at a cost of €80 in advance at an Estonian foreign mission after the employer has completed a 'registration of short-term employment'. New Zealand citizens intending to stay and work in Estonia for more than 6 months can apply for a temporary residence permit for employment after arrival in the country.
permits New Zealand citizens intending to stay in the country for over 3 months to enter without a visa and to apply for a residence permit after arrival (whilst for many other non-EEA and Swiss citizens, a residence permit and visa for a stay over 3 months must be applied for in advance at a German foreign mission).
allows New Zealand citizens who wish to stay for more than 90 days in the country to apply for a residence card from the regional directorate of the Office of Immigration and Nationality within 90 days of arrival and do not need to obtain a residence permit prior to arrival in Hungary (unlike most other non-EEA and Swiss foreign nationals). Family members (who are not New Zealand citizens) accompanying New Zealand citizens can apply for a residence permit after arriving in Hungary. For example, if a New Zealand citizen wishes to move to Hungary with her husband and her daughter (who are both Samoan citizens and not New Zealand citizens), all three of them can apply for a Hungarian residence permit after arriving in Hungary (although the husband and daughter will have to apply for a Schengen visa prior to travelling to Hungary).
permits new Zealand citizens intending to stay in the country for over 3 months as self-employed persons or as businesspersons to enter Latvia without a visa and to apply for a residence permit after arrival (whilst for many non-EEA and Swiss citizens, an application for a residence permit must be lodged in advance at a Latvian foreign mission).
exempts New Zealand citizens from the requirement to obtain a Schengen category "D" visa (the visa issued for long term stays in The Netherlands of over 90 days, known in Dutch as the "MVV" visa) - an exemption which goes beyond the visa waiver afforded to most other non-EEA and non-Swiss foreign nationals who are usually only given a visa waiver of up to 90 days in a 180-day period.
permits New Zealand citizens who have qualifications as a skilled worker to stay in the country without a visa for up to 6 months to seek employment as a skilled worker or a specialist (except as a religious leader/teacher or an ethnic cook), as long as they register with the police within 3 months of arriving in Norway.
permits New Zealand citizens intending to stay in the country for over 3 months to enter Slovakia without a visa and to apply for a residence permit (excluding a working holiday residence permit) after arrival (whilst for many other non-EEA and Swiss citizens, an application for a residence permit and visa for a stay over 3 months must be lodged in advance at a Slovak foreign mission).
offers New Zealand citizens a more generous visa exemption than that which Schengen rules normally provide for. Not only are New Zealand citizens able to spend 3 months visa-free in Switzerland, they can also stay for over 3 months (i.e. without time limit) without the need to apply for a visa. However, at a cantonal level, individual cantonal migration authorities may impose further requirements, such as the need to register for a residence permit, if a New Zealand citizen wants to take up employment or reside for over 3 months, in which case a residence permit must be applied for before entry to Switzerland.
Visa exemptions and requirements for the United Kingdom
New Zealand citizens are able to visit the United Kingdom for up to 6 months (or 3 months if they enter from the Republic of Ireland) without the need to apply for a visa as long as they fulfil all of the following criteria:
they do not work during their stay in the UK
they must not register a marriage or register a civil partnership during their stay in the UK
they are able to present evidence of sufficient money to fund their stay in the UK (if requested by the border inspection officer)
they intend to leave the UK at the end of their visit and can meet the cost of their return or onward journey
if under the age of 18, they can demonstrate evidence of suitable care arrangements and parental (or guardian's) consent for their stay in the UK
However, even though, strictly speaking, they are not required to apply for a visa if they satisfy all of the above criteria, New Zealand citizens who fall into any of the following categories have been strongly advised by the UK Border Agency (replaced by UK Visas and Immigration) to apply for a visa prior to travelling to the UK if:
they have any unspent criminal convictions in any country
they have previously been refused entry or breached the terms of any entry to the UK, or been deported or otherwise removed from the UK
they have previously applied for a visa and been refused one
they have been warned by a UK official that they should obtain a visa before travelling to the UK
New Zealand citizens who were born before 1983 and qualify for right of abode are able to live and work in the United Kingdom indefinitely.
New Zealand citizens with a grandparent born either in the United Kingdom, Channel Islands or Isle of Man at any time or in the Republic of Ireland on or before 31 March 1922 can apply for UK Ancestry Entry Clearance, which enables them to work in the UK for 5 years, after which they can apply to settle indefinitely.
New Zealand citizens aged 18 to 30 can apply for a Youth Mobility Scheme visa which allows them to pursue a working holiday in the UK for 2 years.
New Zealand citizens can study in the United Kingdom for up to 6 months as a student visitor without the need to apply for a visa as long as they do not work during this period. If attending a course which is longer than 6 months, New Zealand citizens can apply for a Tier 4 student visa in New Zealand or in the UK merely by completing the application form, quoting the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) reference number issued to them by their UK education provider and presenting evidence of care arrangements (if under the age of 18); they do not need to submit proof of sufficient funds, qualifications or English language ability (which most other foreign nationals need to demonstrate) as long as the UK education provider is recognised as a 'Highly Trusted' sponsor by the UK Border Agency. However, the UK Border Agency reserves the right to request such evidence in particular situations and New Zealand citizens must still present such evidence if applying for a Tier 4 student visa outside New Zealand or the UK. New Zealand citizens who have been issued with a Tier 4 student visa (but not those who are in the UK as student visitors) can work in the UK for up to 20 hours per week during term-time and without time restrictions outside term-time.
Visa exemption for Australia
By virtue of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, New Zealand citizens are granted a Special Category Visa on arrival in Australia (which permits residence and work for an indefinite period) as long as:
they present a valid New Zealand passport
they have no criminal convictions
they have no untreated tuberculosis
they have not been deported, excluded or removed from any country
The same privilege is extended to Australian citizens and PR holders.
APEC Business Travel Card
Holders of an APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC) travelling on business do not require a visa to the following countries:
1 – up to 90 days
2 – up to 60 days
3 – up to 59 days

The underparts are whitish except for brown flanks and brown scaling on the breast and belly, central belly and undertail coverts are white. The females are browner than the males but otherwise similar, juveniles are more rufous. The length is 24 cm.
Voice
The song is a typically thrush-like series of melodious, rich notes which varies between islands. ALarm call is a sharp "twit" and there is a soft contact call.
Distribution and subspecies
There are three recognised subspecies, each endemic to a single island. They are:
Turdis bewsheri comorensis Milne-Edwards & Oustalet, 1885: Grand Comoro.
Turdis bewsheri moheliensis Benson, 1960: Mohéli.
Turdis bewsheri bewsheri E. Newton, 1877: Anjouan.
Habitat
Comoro thrush occurs in evergreen primary forest and forest edge from sea level to 700m, except for the subspecies T.B. comorensis which occurs on Mount Karthala above this altitude as no forests exist lower than this.
Habits
The Comoro thrush normally forages low down in the understorey or on the ground, looking fore spiders, grasshoppers, bugs, molluscs and some fruit and seeds. Will go higher into the canopy to feed on fruit. Sometimes joins mixed species flocks. It breeds in mid-August to October when a cup shaped nest is built from plant fibres and roots, covered in moss and lined with fine grasses. It is placed up to 3m from the ground on a tree stump, among epiphytes or along a horizontal branch. the normal clutch is 2 eggs.

A crush fetish is a fetish and a paraphilia in which sexual arousal is associated with observing objects being crushed or being crushed oneself. The crushed objects vary from inanimate items (e.g., food), to injurious and/or fatal crushing of invertebrates (e.g., insects, snails, worms, spiders), or vertebrates (e.g., birds, reptiles, mammals).
In the most severe cases, crushing has involved homicide or extended torture until death of restrained animals including dogs, cats, pigs, and monkeys. Animal welfare organisations, such as the Humane Society of the United States, condemn this practice and consider it extremely disturbing. The motivation for these acts may be the production of a film recording the events, which is sold on the Internet to crush fetishists who find the content sexually gratifying, a tailored genre known as "crush film".
There are currently no laws specifically forbidding the crushing of animals, but the production or trade of crush erotica involving live vertebrates is illegal in many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. In the United States, interstate commerce in (hard) crush videos has been illegal since 2010, and many other countries also have banned them.
Classification
Crush fetishists have used terms to classify crushing, on the basis of the object subjected to the crushing:
'Soft crush' – crushing of inanimate objects and invertebrates. This is the most common form. Most exclusive soft crush fetishists prefer to distinguish themselves from other crush fetishists, believing that other crush fetishists give them an unduly negative reputation.
'Hard crush' – crushing of non-human vertebrates. This is considered more cruel than soft crush as vertebrates are generally believed to have a greater capacity to suffer pain.
Crush films
General
Crush films are videos produced for sexual gratification of crush fetishists.
In crush films, the crushing agent is typically a woman, who will concentrate her body weight upon her feet to compress the object against the floor. The feet are typically dressed in sexually suggestive dominatrix-like footwear, such as high-heels and lace stockings, but other footwear or bare feet may be used. This recalls elements of both foot fetishism and BDSM culture.
Jeff Vilencia is one known director of crush films, such as Smush! Vilencia, along with many other fetishists, has loved to see invertebrates crushed since a young age; he claims that when he was 2–3 years old, he repeatedly attempted to get people to step on him.
Legal status
The legality of crush films and the actual practice of crushing varies by region; however, many have been posted on web sites and are available for download via the Internet, making the control of their distribution difficult.
The production or trade of crush erotica involving vertebrates is condemned by opponents of animal cruelty and is illegal in many countries including the United States.
United States
In 1999, the United States Congress enacted a statute affecting the legality of crush films which criminalized the creation, sale, and possession of depictions of animal cruelty, though with an exception for "any depiction that has serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value." In 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit invalidated the ban on the sale and possession of such films (if not otherwise obscene) as a violation of the Constitution's guarantee for freedom of speech. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the Third Circuit's decision in United States v. Stevens, finding the law unconstitutional because the law was so broad and vague that it included any portrayal of an animal in or being harmed such as by hunting or disease. On November 28, 2010, bill H.R. 5566, which prohibits interstate commerce in animal crush films, was passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate, and on December 9, the bill was signed by President Obama becoming the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010.
On September 8, 2015, a Houston woman pleaded guilty in the nation's first federal animal crush video case.
On November 25, 2019, President Donald Trump signed the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act (PACT Act) into law, making animal “crushing” and sexual abuse of animals a federal felony if the offense is in or affecting foreign or interstate commerce, or if it is committed on federally owned property, such as national parks, federal prisons, and military bases. While the law does not supersede state or local ordinance, a PACT conviction does provide for federal fines and imprisonment of up to seven years. The PACT act defines animal crushing as when "one or more living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles or amphibians is purposely crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated, impaled or otherwise subjected to serious bodily injury."
United Kingdom
Although the majority of films are thought to originate in the United States, the first arrest in the UK was made in 2002. The industry is estimated to generate hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of sales.
China
In 2006 an Internet crush video surfaced in which a woman stomps on a kitten with stiletto high-heels. Eventually the woman drives her heel into the kitten's eye and penetrates the eye socket, leading to loss of blood and the death of the kitten. Internet users discovered and revealed the identity of the woman, and revealed that the cameraman was a provincial television employee. The nurse posted an apology on the Luobei city government website, claiming that she was susceptible to persuasion to crush the kitten, being despondent from her recent divorce. Both the nurse and the cameraman lost their jobs as a result of the incident, although their actions were not illegal under the country's animal cruelty laws.

Dreyer & Reinbold Racing is an automotive racing organization that competes in the IndyCar Series and Nitro Rallycross. The team is owned by Indianapolis BMW, Infiniti, Volkswagen, Mini, and Subaru dealer Dennis Reinbold.
Off the track, Dreyer & Reinbold Racing (DRR) have spent thousands of hours as the national spokesperson & advocate for "Racing for Kids," a national youth charitable foundation. On behalf of "Racing for Kids," DRR has visited more than 20,000 children in over 400 hospitals worldwide and raised nearly $5 million for local children's health initiatives.
IndyCar history
2000–2006
Founded in 2000, DRR was one of the few teams that consistently ran the Infiniti engine until they left the series, then switched to Chevrolet and finally to Honda in 2005. When Buhl retired from the cockpit in 2004, he placed Felipe Giaffone in the cockpit, followed by Roger Yasukawa with financial backing from Honda. With Honda backing gone for 2006, some doubted if the team would continue, as Buhl had consistently stated that if running the team did not make financial sense, he would shut it down. However, sponsorship was found and the team named 2000 series champion Buddy Lazier their primary driver. In 2002 the team ran a second car for Sarah Fisher, who became the first woman in North American motorsports history to win the pole position for a major-league open-wheel race, earning the pole at Kentucky Speedway. In the 2006 Indianapolis 500, the team's second car was driven by Al Unser Jr.
The team's only win came in their debut race, 2000 IRL season opener at Walt Disney World Speedway when Buhl stunned the series with a win from the 22nd starting position. In 2006 the team scored their best finish in years when Ryan Briscoe showed a great turn of speed in the wet at Watkins Glen International to get on the podium. During that time, other good results in the season were few and far between.
2007–2009
For 2007, the team recruited two ex-Fernandez Racing engineers and added a new sponsor. On January 31, 2007, 2004 Indianapolis 500 winner Buddy Rice and Sarah Fisher would drive for the team. Rice brought in respectable performances, finishing 9th in points with three top-five finishes. Fisher struggled to 17th place in points after playing second fiddle to the "A Team" often being given less than par equipment. Fisher announced in late 2007 that she would leave the team due to a lack of commitment from the team to her efforts.
Rice returned to the team in 2008 while the team's second car was shared by Milka Duno and Townsend Bell, with all three drivers competing in the 2008 Indianapolis 500. Both Rice and Bell finished in the top-10 (8th and 10th respectively) while Duno finished 19th in the race. Rice finished 16th in points with the best finish of fourth at Watkins Glen.
2009 saw Dreyer & Reinbold bring on a completely new driver lineup from 2008. Joining the team full-time was British rookie Mike Conway, who most had previously competed in the GP2 Series. A second full-time entry was shared between Darren Manning (two races), Milka Duno, and Tomas Scheckter. In addition, Roger Yasukawa also returned to the team for the race at Twin Ring Motegi. The team also fielded cars for Richard Petty Motorsports driven by John Andretti and for Kingdom Racing and driver Davey Hamilton in the 2009 Indianapolis 500. The cars of Duno, Andretti, and Conway all struggled to qualify but made the field on bump day, the final day of qualifications. Conway, Andretti, and Duno were the last-placed cars running at the finish in the 18th, 19th, and 20th positions respectively. Throughout the rest of the season, Conway struggled for consistency, only finishing nine of the seventeen races, but was fast at times on the road courses, finishing on the podium in third at Infineon Raceway.
2010–2011
On February 2, 2010 it was announced that Justin Wilson would be joining Dreyer & Reinbold Racing for the 2010 IndyCar season in the No. 22 Z-Line Designs car. Wilson was to be partnered throughout the season by returning driver Mike Conway.
For the opening race in Brazil they were joined by Ana Beatriz. For the 94th running of the Indianapolis 500 the team was expanded to run four cars for Tomas Scheckter and Ana Beatriz. After Conway was sidelined for an accident in the closing stages of the Indy 500, Wilson was partnered by Tomas Scheckter, Graham Rahal and Paul Tracy. It was announced that he will be joined by J. R. Hildebrand who will make his Indycar debut at Mid-Ohio.
The Toronto event was Wilson's breakthrough event of the season, after being in the top two in each of the three practice sessions, he dominated qualifying. Wilson made it to the Firestone Fast Six shootout without using a single set of the faster red-walled (alternate compound) tires, and easily took the pole for the race after posting a record lap time of 1:00.2710s. Wilson went on to lead much of the race, however after losing grip coming off of turn 11 on a restart late in the race, his car spun and relinquished the lead to Will Power. Even after Wilson found himself pointing the wrong way in turn 8, he was able to rebound to a seventh-place finish.
After healing, Conway left DRR for Andretti Autosport for the 2011 IndyCar season and was replaced by rookie Ana Beatriz and her sponsor Petroleo Ipiranga. On 11 November 2010 an announcement was made confirming Wilson would remain with Dreyer & Reinbold for a second year.
2012–2013
On November 17, 2011, Dreyer & Reinbold Racing and Group Lotus PLC announced that DRR would serve as a Lotus factory partner team. Additionally, the historic auto manufacturer provided DRR entries with its new Lotus IndyCar V-6 racing engine for the 2012 IndyCar season. On January 17, 2012 the team announced Oriol Servia as the team's full-time entry
On April 23, Dreyer & Reinbold and Lotus mutually agreed to end their existing engine contract. Subsequently, on May 7, the team announced a strategic alliance with Panther Racing to provide technical support as well as the use of the second Chevrolet engine contract held by Panther. The team's performance dramatically improved, with back-to-back top-5 finishes at Indy and Detroit. Servia would finish the season with 3 more top 10s, eventually finishing 13th in points.
Dreyer & Reinbold Racing continued their partnership with Panther Racing for the 2013 season with driver Oriol Servia, however, the team decided to withdraw from the 2013 season after the Indianapolis 500 due to lack of sponsorship. The decision did not affect Panther Racing.
2014–present: Part-time team
After the 2013 Indianapolis 500, the team cut its staff and pulled out of IndyCar competition due to losing its primary sponsorship. The team made its return in the 2014 Indianapolis 500 with the help of Kingdom Racing with driver Sage Karam. Despite starting 31st, Karam would finish 9th. Townsend Bell was the Dreyer & Reinbold Kingdom Racing driver in the 2015 Indianapolis 500, finishing 14th. Sage Karam returned for the 2016 Indianapolis 500, crashing midway through the race.
In 2017, Karam drove for Dreyer & Reinbold Kingdom Racing at the Indianapolis 500, retiring with mechanical problems. In addition, Reinbold became a technical partner of Harding Racing, who entered Gabby Chaves at the three 500 milers.
In 2018 and 2019, Dreyer & Reinbold entered both Karam and J. R. Hildebrand with their best finish being 11th by Hildebrand in 2018.
On January 7, 2020, Dreyer & Reinbold announced that they would be expanding their race schedule to at least four races. These races included the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, GMR Grand Prix, Indianapolis 500, and Honda Indy Toronto. Karam drove all four races while Hildebrand returned for the 500.
Rallycross
Dreyer & Reinbold Racing debuted in rallycross in 2016 by entering the Global RallyCross Championship, where Cabot Bigham was the GRC Lites champion. In 2017, Christian Brooks finished second and Travis PeCoy finished third. The team switched to the new Americas Rallycross Championship in 2018, where Christian Brooks was runner-up in the ARX2 class. In 2021, Cole Keatts was runner-up and Conner Martell was third, meanwhile Sage Karam claimed a win and four runner-up finishes in a part-time ARX2 entry.
In 2021, DRR signed a partnership with KYB EKS JC to compete in Nitro Rallycross. For the 2022–23 season, the team allied with JC Raceteknik and expanded to a four-car program in NRX's Group E class.

The 2021 Super Rugby season was the 26th season of Super Rugby, an annual men's international rugby union tournament organised by SANZAAR, involving teams from Australia and New Zealand. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was wholly regionalised, with the 2021 Super Rugby Aotearoa season and the 2021 Super Rugby AU season replacing the previous 15 side formats used from 2018 till 2020. Super Rugby Trans-Tasman followed these tournaments, a crossover competition that featured the five Australian sides playing the five New Zealand sides.
Competition format
The five New Zealand sides competed in the 2nd Super Rugby Aotearoa season, while the four Australian sides, plus the addition again of the Western Force, competed in the 2nd Super Rugby AU season. The competition did not feature any South African sides who announced their withdrawal from Super Rugby in September 2020, while the Japanese side, the Sunwolves, was confirmed as leaving the league in March 2019. The Argentinian side, the Jaguares, were also not named in any competition and did not compete in 2021. Following the draw for the 2021 Super Rugby AU season, Rugby Australia confirmed they were working with New Zealand Rugby on a trans-Tasman competition to follow the Super Rugby Aotearoa and Super Rugby AU seasons. On 13 November, this tournament was confirmed as Super Rugby Trans-Tasman, which featured the Australian and New Zealand sides playing each other in 25 crossovers matches before a final. All sides played two home matches, and two away matches as well as a 'Super Round' where all matches will be played in one location over the course of one weekend. The final was then held between the top two teams in the combined competition table.
Law variations
Both Super Rugby AU and Super Rugby Aotearoa saw law changes again for 2021. Super Rugby AU saw changes to kick-offs and restarts, with a free kick awarded if a kickoff has not taken place 30 seconds following the opposition scoring, a restart is kicked out on the full or if teammates of the kicker are not behind the ball. The free kick will take place at half way. These rules are similar to those that are currently used in Rugby sevens. Also the 'Golden point' law brought in during the 2020 season is tweaked so that full-time will only occur after a try is scored, rather than any form of points. Penalties and drop goals will still count towards the score during extra time, but will not end the game, with play only ending if a try is scored or the 10-minute extra time period ends.
Super Rugby Aotearoa saw the introduction of Goal-line drop outs, brought in for when an attacking player is held up or knocks the ball on in goal. When a kick is forced in goal by the defending team then a goal-line drop out will also take place. These rules were used successfully in the Australian 2020 Super Rugby AU season. Extra time was also used again in 2021, again consisting of a 10-minute period, however differing from the 2021 Super Rugby AU season, the team scoring the first points of any kind in this period will win the match. A captain's referral was also brought in for 2021, similar to those used successfully in cricket and tennis, with New Zealand Rugby becoming the first to trial it in rugby union. Each team is allowed one referral per match which can be used in one of three scenarios: a decision occurring in the final five minutes of a match, an offence in the build up to a try being scored or an act of foul play. All other law variations from the 2020 season were again used in both Super Rugby competitions in the 2021 season.
Future developments
In the longer term, a new 12-team tournament from 2022 onwards was mooted, with the current four Australian and five New Zealand sides, plus the full time return of the Australian side the Western Force to Super Rugby, following their departure from the competition at the end of the 2017 Super Rugby season. It was suggested they be joined in the competition by teams from the Pacific Islands and Fiji, with South African sides having confirmed their departure from Super Rugby to join an expanded Pro14 competition, and no place for the Argentinian Jaguares either. On 13 November, New Zealand Rugby confirmed Fiji Rugby and Moana Pasifika as its preferred partners for Super Rugby going forward. A Hawaiian side had been mooted to join the competition, with Kanaloa Pasifika having gone through the process to try and join the competition, however they were not selected by New Zealand Rugby. Kanaloa Pasifika launched legal action over this decision, stating that Moana Pasifika had not gone through the correct process to join the competition.
On 24 February 2021, the Fiji Rugby Union announced it had completed its business plan for the entry of Fijian Drua to Super Rugby in 2022 and submitted it to the New Zealand Rugby Union. The plan outlines financial targets, initial playing squad and coaching structure as well as outlining the complete administrative structures for the team. The team will be a separate entity from the Fijian Rugby Union, similar to that of the Drua's entry into the Australian National Rugby Championship in 2017. The team is still required to meet stringent financial conditions set by the New Zealand Rugby Union, and so was seeking NZ$10 million in private investment to allow the team to join in 2022. Further steps were announced on both sides joining the competition in March 2021, with New Zealand Rugby Union agreeing to a sharing of broadcasting revenue with both potential sides. On 24 March 2021, World Rugby announced financial, high performance and administrative support for both potential new franchises, in order to boost the performances of Pacific Islands at international level, while also being able to stay local instead of heading overseas.
On 14 April 2021, both the Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika were granted conditional licenses to join Super Rugby in 2022 by the New Zealand Rugby Union. They will join the existing five New Zealand Super Rugby sides, plus the existing four Australian sides along with the Western Force who will return to the competition full-time having taken part in both editions of Super Rugby AU and Super Rugby Trans-Tasman.
On 12 July 2021, Moana Pasifika were granted an unconditional licence, confirming them for the 2022 Super Rugby season.

Carrie Cornplanter (1887–1918) was a Native American artist of the Seneca tribe.
Little is recorded of Cornplanter's life save that she was the elder sister of Jesse Cornplanter, had a sister named Anna, and had children of her own, and that her native name was "dédon". The three were descendants of Chief Cornplanter and the daughters of Edward Cornplanter. Carrie's paintings are among the earliest known by an American Indian woman to depict traditional aspects of native life. Most were created during the last decade of the 19th century or the first decade of the 20th, and she was thus at a relatively young age when she made the paintings. One such work, Indian Squaws Pounding Corn, is owned by the National Museum of the American Indian. Dating to around 1900, it was donated to the museum in 1922 by Joseph W. Keppler, a friend of the principal benefactor of the museum George Gustav Heye. Keppler likely purchased the piece directly from the artist or from a member of her family.
Carrie died in the 1918 flu pandemic. Her sister Anna and two of Carrie's daughters were the only members of the family other than Jesse to survive; the children were left destitute by the loss of their mother and were placed in Jesse's care when he returned home from World War I in Europe.

The Post Attack Command and Control System (PACCS) was a network of communication sites (both ground and airborne) for use before, during and after a nuclear attack on the United States. PACCS was designed to ensure that National Command Authority would retain exclusive and complete control over US nuclear weapons. Among other components, it included Strategic Air Command assets such as the Looking Glass aircraft and mission, and various hardened command and control facilities.
The belief by the Soviet Union in the reliability of PACCS was a crucial component of the US mutual assured destruction doctrine, ensuring a long-term stalemate.
History
The Strategic Air Command headquarters staff, under the direction of General Thomas S. Power assessed the feasibility of placing a continuous command and control element in an airborne mode. The purpose of such a system would be to use the aircraft as a platform for specially installed communications equipment to ensure delivery of command directives to SAC strike forces in the event ground-based headquarters were destroyed.
The original plan envisioned an aircraft, crew, and command and control team on 15-minute ground alert. This was later changed to a continuous airborne alert posture. The functions of this PACCS Airborne Command Post kept expanding until it became a true alternate command and control system, complete with force status monitoring, initiation or relay of launch/execution directives, a battle staff, communications to support an alternate CINCSAC, and limited capabilities to reconstitute and replan residual resources.
PACCS, in later variants, included an Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) capability, which provided an alternate means for execution message delivery to missile combat crews and a back-up launch control center, forcing the Soviet Union to target each missile silo, rather than just the launch control centers to incapacitate the Minuteman force.

The Custom House was a 19th-century Neo-classical building located in Liverpool, England. It housed a post office, dock office, and offices for Customs and Excise. It was built on the site of the historic Old Dock in 1839 and operated up to World War II when it was partly destroyed during the Liverpool Blitz, then finally demolished in 1948. Today the area which formed the base of the building makes up part of the Liverpool One shopping complex. It is considered amongst Liverpool's most regrettably lost buildings.
History
Following the closure of the Old Dock on 31 August 1826, plans were made for the construction of what was to be Liverpool's fifth Custom house on the site which was filled in with concrete prior to construction. The town's surveyor, John Foster, who would later go on to design The Oratory and St James Cemetery, was charged with designing the H-shaped building located parallel to the shoreline. On 12 August 1828, the first stone was laid by Liverpool's mayor, Thomas Colley Porter, to mark the start of construction; this took 11 years, with the building opening in 1839.
In 1941, during World War II, the Custom House was hit with a bomb, partly destroying the building but ultimately leaving its structure intact. After the war had ended, the government (who owned the building) refused to repair the building despite protests, and it was subsequently demolished in 1948.
Notably the building was a subject of a painting by John Atkinson Grimshaw.

Finland's Independence Day (, ) is a national public holiday, and a flag flying day, held on 6 December to celebrate Finland's declaration of independence from the Russian Empire when the Bolsheviks took power in late 1917.
History
The movement for Finland's independence started after the revolutions in Russia, caused by disturbances inside Russia from hardships connected to the First World War. This gave Finland an opportunity to withdraw from Russian rule. After several disagreements between the non-socialists and the social-democrats over who should have power in Finland, on 4 December 1917, the Senate of Finland, led by Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, finally made a Declaration of Independence which was adopted by the Finnish parliament two days later.
Independence Day was first celebrated in 1917. However, during the first years of independence, 6 December in some parts of Finland was only a minor holiday compared to 16 May, the Whites' day of celebration for prevailing in the Finnish Civil War. The left parties would have wanted to celebrate 15 November, because the people of Finland (represented by parliament) took power 15 November 1917. When a year had passed since declaration of independence, 6 December 1918, the academic people celebrated the day.
Observance
During the early decades of independence, occasion marked by patriotic speeches and special church services. From the 1970s onwards, however, Independence Day celebrations have taken livelier forms, with shops decorating their windows in the blue and white of the Finnish flag, and bakeries producing cakes with blue and white icing.
It is traditional for Finnish families to light two candles in each window of their home in the evening. This custom dates to the 1920s; but even earlier, candles had been placed in Finnish windows on poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg's birthday as a silent protest against Russian oppression. A popular legend has it that two candles were used as a sign to inform young Finnish men on their way to Sweden and Germany to become jägers that the house was ready to offer shelter and keep them hidden from the Russians.
State festivities
Official Independence Day festivities usually commence with the raising of the Finnish flag on Tähtitorninmäki ("Observatory Hill") in Helsinki. A religious service is held at Helsinki Cathedral, and official visits are made to the war memorials of World War II. Another event is the annual military parade by personnel of the Finnish Defense Forces, which is one of the big highlights and is a nationally televised event.
YLE, Finland's national public service broadcaster, broadcasts the movie adaptation of Tuntematon Sotilas ("The Unknown Soldier"), based on Väinö Linna's iconic novel. In most years, the original 1955 film has been shown (dozens of times) and every year since 2000; but the 1985 version has also been shown once—in 1997 & in addition to the 2017 version premiered in 2021.
The traditional torch cavalcade by students has been held annually since 1951. The cavalcade is held in various towns and cities with a university and wreaths are placed on war graves.
In the evening, the Presidential Independence Day reception is held for approximately 2000 invited guests at the Presidential Palace. This event, known informally also as Linnanjuhlat ("the Castle Ball"), is broadcast on national television and has been a perennial favourite of the viewing public. The first presidential ball was organized in 1919, and the event has been held most years since.
The reception invariably attracts the attention of demonstrators in support of various causes, and various demonstrations and shadow parties are held to coincide with the official event. The late philanthropist Veikko Hursti organized the most popular of these demonstrations, providing free food to the poor and underprivileged. Since Hursti's death in 2005, the tradition has been carried on by his son, Heikki Hursti.
The most popular television segment of the Independence Day reception is the entrance of the guests. These include persons who receive invitations every year, including the knights of the Mannerheim Cross (traditionally the first ones to enter), members of the government and the Parliament of Finland, archbishops, judges, high military and police officers, and various diplomats and dignitaries. The second group includes guests of the President's own choosing: typically entertainers; activists; sportspersons; and in general, people who have been in the spotlight over the past year. The last guests to enter are always the surviving former Finnish presidents.
90th anniversary commemorative coin
The 90th anniversary of Finland's Declaration of Independence was selected as the main motif for a high-value commemorative coin, the €5 90th Anniversary of Finland's Declaration of Independence commemorative coin, minted in 2007. The reverse shows petroglyphic aesthetics, while the obverse has a nine-oar boat with rowers, symbolizing collaboration as a true Finnish trait. Signs of music and Finnish kantele strings can be discerned in the coin's design.
100th anniversary
The centenary of Finland's independence was celebrated in 2017. The theme was "Together".

Siaosi (George) Manumataongo ʻAlaivahamamaʻo ʻAhoʻeitu Konstantin Tukuʻaho (born 17 September 1985) is the crown prince of Tonga. Tupoutoʻa ʻUlukalala became heir apparent to the throne in March 2012 upon the accession of his father, Tupou VI, as King of Tonga.
Education
Tukuʻaho was educated at Australian National University, graduating with a Master of Military and Defence Studies in 2018 and a Master of Diplomacy in 2021.
2012 wedding
On 12 July 2012, Crown Prince Tupoutoʻa ʻUlukalala married his double second cousin, Sinaitakala Fakafanua, in a wedding attended by 2,000 people. He was 26 years old at the time, while his wife was 25 years old. Sinaitakala Fakafanua is 26th in line to the Tongan throne.
The wedding marked the first marriage of a Tongan crown prince in sixty-five years. The ceremony was held at the Centennial Church of the Free Church of Tonga in Nuku'alofa, with more than 2,000 guests, including Samoan and Fijian chiefly families. The groom wore morning dress, while the bride wore a long sleeve, lace wedding gown with a veil that reached the floor of the church. A Maʻutohi ceremony, which celebrates the issuance of a marriage license, was held earlier in the week.
Controversy
The marriage between the Crown Prince and Fakafanua caused controversy over the continued practice of marrying closely related cousins. Tongan royal protocol requires that members of royal family only marry members of noble families to maintain a 'strong' bloodline. All royal marriages are arranged.
The wedding between the cousins was openly criticised by a few members of Tongan political and royal circles. Two prominent members of the Tongan royal family, Queen Mother Halaevalu Mataʻaho ʻAhomeʻe and the king's sister, Princess Salote Pilolevu Tuita, disapproved of the marriage and refused to attend the ceremony. Daughter of the Princess Royal of Tonga, Frederica Tuita, who is ninth in line to the throne, openly condemned the union, calling the royal arranged marriage "extremely arrogant and only perpetuated the motive behind social climbers". Pro-democracy leader ʻAkilisi Pohiva also criticised the wedding, telling TVNZ, "They are too close... I do not know about biological effects of two close bloods mixed together, but I think they need new blood from outside." A leader of Tongans living in New Zealand, Will Ilolahia, stated that many Tongans opposed the second cousins' marriage, but were unwilling to speak out publicly.
An uncle of the Crown Prince, Lord Vaea, defended the marriage saying, "It's a new beginning for the royal household. They are both in their twenties, we are looking at that to preserve that constitutional monarchy within Tonga."
Issue
His firstborn child, a son, Prince Taufaʻahau Manumataongo, was born on 10 May 2013 at Auckland City Hospital in Auckland, becoming second in the line of succession to the Tongan throne, after his father. On 12 July 2014, the Crown Princess gave birth to a daughter, Princess Halaevalu Mataʻaho, at Auckland City Hospital in Auckland. His third child and second daughter, Princess Nanasipauʻu Eliana, was born on 20 March 2018 at the Auckland City Hospital in New Zealand.
His fourth child and third daughter, Princess Salote Mafileʻo Pilolevu, was born on 25 February 2021 at Calvary Public Hospital Bruce in Canberra.

San Vito (), originally named San Vito de Java, is a district and head city of the Coto Brus canton, in the Puntarenas province of Costa Rica. It is located about southeast of the capital San José, and close to the Panama border.
Toponymy
Contrary to popular belief, the name San Vito does not refer to Vito Sansonetti, one of the first landowners in the area, but honors the Italian saint Vitus, founder of villages, who coincidentally had the same name.
The name “Jaba”, according to the legend, is due to the fact that at one point the migrants met a Panamanian Indian by the stream as he was passing through San Vito with a “jaba” (a package consisting of a wooden box) on his back. The river is said to have taken the name that it bears to this day.
History
San Vito was founded in 1952, since when it has become an important center in Costa Rica's Brunca region.
San Vito district was created on 10 December 1965 by Ley 3598.
San Vito de Java was the result of a process of foreign agricultural colonization organized by the state of Costa Rica. Its two goals were to populate the country with foreign settlers, and to establish settlements in outlying areas. San Vito was founded by settlers from Europe, in particular Italy.
In 1952, in the midst of the post-war socioeconomic crisis in Europe, the two brothers Vito Giulio Cesar and Ugo Sansonetti organized a group of Italian pioneers from forty different places, from Trieste to Taranto, and including a handful from Istria and Dalmatia.
This Italian immigration is a typical example of directed agricultural colonization, similar in many ways to the process in other places in Latin America. The European immigrants were helped by the (CIME), (Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration).
Vito Sansonetti (1916-1999), a seaman by profession, was the founder of the colonizing company which he named (SICA), (Italian Agricultural Colonisation Society), and was in charge of negotiations with the Costa Rican authorities represented by the (ITCO) (Institute of Land and Colonization). His brother, lawyer Ugo Sansonetti, lived in San Vito and acted as the leader and agent of the company in the region.
Previously, the area had been known simply as Coto Brus, a place name of indigenous origin. At the time, the country was very interested in expanding new agricultural frontiers in order to develop and diversify the economy, as well as to attract foreign investment by means of easy bank loans and land grants.
Geography
San Vito has an area of km2 and an elevation of metres.
The city is located on a high plateau with very irregular topography, at an altitude of above sea level in the foothills of the Talamanca Mountain Range. The narrow and fast-flowing Java River traverses the outskirts of San Vito from northeast to southeast.
In terms of geomorphology, San Vito is situated in the Valle de Coto Brus (Coto Brus Valley), a depression caused by tectonic activity, and which extends from San Isidro to Panama. The valley is convergent, that is to say the Coto Brus Valley and the Coto Brus River that runs through it meet the Valle del General (Valley of the General), forming the Térraba River plain.
The district is characterized by mountain foothills and irregular high plateaus, and consequently its rivers are straight and fast-flowing.
Climatologically, it is under the influence of the south Pacific climate, meaning that it is characterized by an annual precipitation of 3050 mm, with rain falling on 175 days a year on average. The average temperature is 23 °C, and there is a three-month dry season from December to March. San Vito is affected by moisture coming from the Pacific and entering the area through the Térraba and Coto River valleys.
Vegetation is predominantly low-altitude evergreen wet forest, which is found in wet areas with temperatures between 23 and 38 °C at altitudes from sea level to 1000 metres. Tree species include almond, cedro amargo, gavilán, espavel and kativo, among others.
Demographics
For the 2011 census, San Vito had a population of inhabitants.
There is emigration to more developed areas of Costa Rica or abroad, and a reduced birth rate. On the other hand, many of the inhabitants are temporary, living in the area according to the need to harvest certain crops, coffee in particular.
51% of the population of San Vito are men, and 49% are women. 56% are under fifteen years old and only 5% are over 65 years old, making it a very young city. People of working age make up 39% of the total.
The population of San Vito represents 49% of the total population of the Coto Brus canton.
No other place in Costa Rica has been so strongly influenced by Italian culture, even though with the passing years it has been greatly modified by contributions from other ethnic groups: Creole, Guaymi Native Americans, Asian, and so on.
Education
7% of the population of San Vito have not completed any type of education. 24.8% have completed only primary, while 9% have satisfactorily completed secondary. 6.6% of the population have completed a university education. San Vito is the only place in Costa Rica (other than some small communities) in which the teaching of the Italian language is compulsory in the educational system, and promoted by the (Ministry of Public Education) in order to save Italian customs and traditions.
Economy
Coto Brus overall is one of the zones that rank lowest in Costa Rica on the Human Development Index. The economy is primarily based on agriculture and cattle farming. The principal crops are coffee, sugarcane, maize/corn, plantains, and beans. Cattle farming has also developed, although on a smaller scale.
Manufacturing is small, linked to farming and to the production of handicrafts for local consumption.
The town is served by San Vito de Java Airport.
Sociedad Italiana de Colonización Agrícola
The government of Costa Rica offered 10,000 hectares of land, and the contract was signed in 1951. SICA undertook to install 250 families of which 20% would be Costa Rican. The period of 1952 to 1964 was characterised by the settlement and consolidation of the colony. Each family received 20 hectares to use for agriculture.
The colonists had to confront many problems, especially due to the isolation of the region. Nevertheless, from 1964 on, the production of coffee caused the outlook to change for the better. The contract signed in 1951 was a driving force which brought in both the Italian colonists and Costa Ricans from different parts of the country attracted by the economic possibilities that the area offered.
By the 1960s, the colonization effort was bearing fruit. The colonists were making a decent living, the coffee trees had reached a good level of production, and there was other farming, mainly subsistence crops. There was also an urban center where public and social services were available.
In San Vito itself the population went from 45 inhabitants in 1952 to 10,710 in 1982, an annual growth of 710%, while the growth rate for the canton of Coto Brus was 91% over the same period, the number of inhabitants going from 1,000 to 28,000.
SICA began the construction of a series of buildings such as the hospital, the school, the sawmill, industries, and businesses, while the government of Costa Rica undertook to construct a highway between San Vito and Golfito.
Cattle farming was very successful.
Tourism
Tourism is only just beginning in the area due to a lack of interest on the part of both private business and government. The access roads are in poor condition, and the infrastructure is insufficient to serve the needs of tourism. Nevertheless, the following are noteworthy:
Dante Alighieri Cultural Center across from the park offers historical information on the Italian immigration. Behind the center is a Jeep that was hit by a bomb in Italy during World War II.
Wilson Botanical Garden and Las Cruces Biological Station 6 km south of San Vito, protects more than 300 hectares of premontane wet forest at altitudes between 1000 and 1400 metres. It is home to some 2,000 species of plants, more than 400 species of birds, and 113 species of mammals.
La Amistad International Park is 60 km north of San Vito.
The Reserva Forestal Las Tablas (Las Tablas Forest Reserve) covers 19,602 hectares, with rugged terrain and a great variety of climates.

Symphony is the name of two varieties of chocolate bars made by The Hershey Company under the Hershey brand name. The milk chocolate contains the identical ingredients used in the regular chocolate bars made by Hershey's, but have varying amounts of some ingredients (specifically cocoa butter, chocolate and lactose) in order to give a creamier flavor. Introduced in 1989, the Symphony bar has remained in production today (unlike the Mild and Mellow bar introduced in 1934 and dropped from production in 1941). These are two of the Hershey chocolate candy bars that are a departure from Hershey's original milk chocolate recipe which was designed by Milton Hershey in 1894.
The name "Symphony" is given to the bars because it is supposed to be a treat to the mouth in the same way music is to the ears.
History
Symphony was developed after research began in 1984. Prior to its release to the general public, it was first testmarketed in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas. It was targeted to a more mature audience including the middle- and upper-class consumers.
It was found to be the most preferred of nine products test-marketed by Hershey's in China.
Advertising
Symphony was introduced with the first ads featuring classical music and the tagline: “There will never be another unfinished Symphony.” Symphony was launched in two varieties: Milk Chocolate (sometimes called the "plain" version) and Milk Chocolate with Almonds and Toffee (which contains almonds and toffee chips).

Mephisto Walz are an American gothic rock band formed in 1985. The band's discography includes many full-length albums spanning nearly three decades, through Cleopatra Records and other labels.
History
Bari-Bari's signature songwriting style and distinctive wall of chorus/delay-effected guitar sound makes Mephisto Walz instantly identifiable amongst other pioneers of deathrock.
Mephisto Walz was formed in 1986 by Barry Galvin (aka Bari-Bari) and John Schuman (Johann), following their departure from the influential deathrock band Christian Death. Bari-Bari had joined Christian Death as bassist while the iconic Rozz Williams was still vocalist (Williams left the band in 1985, with guitarist Valor Kand becoming its lead singer and principal songwriter).
Christian Death's 1985 album "Atrocities" and the EPs "The Wind Kissed Pictures" and "Believers of the Unpure" featured Bari-Bari, Johann (bass), and David Glass (drums), all of whom would feature in one or more incarnation of Mephisto Walz.
Following conflict with Kand, Bari-Bari and Johann departed Christian Death. The band's 1986 album "Atrocities" includes several tracks composed by Bari-Bari, notably "Tales of Innocence", "Strapping Me Down", and "Silent Thunder". Additionally, 1985's "The Wind Kissed Pictures" EP features Bari-Bari's "The Wind Kissed Pictures" and "Lacrima Christi", while the "Believers of the Unpure" single, released in '86, includes his composition "Between Youth".
The first incarnation of Mephisto Walz started in Düsseldorf in February 1986, with original members Bari-Bari (the band's sole songwriter), Johann, and Arndt (drums), plus a German vocalist called Jörge. The name Mephisto Walz was proposed by Johann. They rehearsed songs mainly written by Bari-Bari, but also added soundscapes such as “Aboriginee Requiem”. The band's eponymous debut album was released on Italian label Supporti Fonografici that same year. In 1987 they moved to Los Angeles, without Johann.
In 1988, Bari-Bari started working on tracks with Steven Grey in Hollywood at a studio where the former worked. They regrouped with David Hermon (bass), Mondo (vox) and Nariki Shimooka (guitar). Playing the first EP and some of Bari-Bari's Christian Death material they added new songs that would later be released on the “Crocosmia”, “Terra-Regina” and “Thalia” albums. During this period, songs that would later become "Mephisto Walz Rarities 1989" were recorded live in studio.
In 1991, Christianna was brought in as vocalist as Bari-Bari felt that male vocals were too similar to Williams and Christian Death. William Faith was added on bass at the same time. An association with Gymnastic Records was started with the compilation "American Gothic", which featured Mephisto Walz's "Tangia". “Crocosmia” was then recorded for European release, consisting of new tracks and some older tracks redone with Christianna on vocals.
In 1992, a co-headlined tour with Shadow Project (featuring Williams and Eva O) brought Mephisto Walz back to Germany, where they stayed and recorded "As Apostles Forget". Bari-Bari also wrote part of what would be “Terra-Regina” and “Thalia”, before returning to the U.S.
In Los Angeles, Johann and Glass were available again and replaced Faith and Grey. Work then began with Bari-Bari and Christianna on the next three complete releases - "Eternal Deep", "Terra-Regina" and "Thalia", through new label Cleopatra Records.
In 1994-1999, Bari-Bari and Christianna completed cover singles for Cleopatra, as well as "Early Recordings" and "Immersion". The recordings were made with Bari-Bari (all music) and Christianna (vocals). The "Nightingale" EP was recorded by Bari-Bari and Christianna in 2002 for the Fossil Dungeon label, followed by the album "Insidious" in 2004.
For the next few years, Bari-Bari played and recorded with Scarlet's Remains and recorded bands in his L.A. studio.
In 2011 "IIIrd Incarnation" was recorded with both Bari-Bari and Sara Reid on vocals. A more aggressive guitar style was reintroduced. Two years later, "New Apostles" was recorded with Bari-Bari and Myriam Galvin now on vocals. It featured Christian Omar Madrigal Izzo on four tracks. 2017's "Scoundrel” was written and recorded by Bari-Bari and Myriam, with Omar Madrigal Izzo again performing on select songs.

It Felt Like Love is a 2013 independent drama film, the first feature film directed by Eliza Hittman. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was later acquired by Variance Films, receiving a limited theatrical release in March 2014. The film follows the coming-of-age of teenager Lila as she riskily courts the attentions of an older boy.
Plot
Lila, a fourteen-year-old girl who lives in Brooklyn with her widowed father, wants to be like her more sexually experienced friend Chiara. Lila and Chiara are in the same dance class and are spending the summer preparing for a big performance. Although Chiara is more experienced, she has only made it to third base with her boyfriend Patrick. Lila likes to portray herself as similarly experienced, when in reality her primary exposure to sex is tagging along on Chiara and Patrick's outings and being an awkward bystander to the couple's PDA. One day at the beach, Lila makes eye contact with the older and tough Sammy. Hearing that Sammy is the type of guy who will "sleep with anyone," Lila aggressively pursues Sammy, going to the arcade where he works and telling friends she is in a relationship with him. Sammy is clearly not interested in Lila and sees her as just a kid, but he does not outright reject her advances, either.
Lila increasingly puts herself in dangerously vulnerable situations in order to get Sammy's attention. She goes alone to Sammy's apartment, where Sammy is hanging out with his male friends as porn plays on the TV. At one point, Sammy's friends start making crude jokes about Lila giving all of the guys simultaneous oral sex. Lila, naive and hungry for male attention, goes along with the jokes. After this scene, Lila is shown taking a bus back to her home. The question of whether Lila actually did anything sexual with the guys is left open to interpretation. The film ends with the performance of Lila and Chiara's dance team, with visuals that underscore the rocky terrain of adolescence.

Production
Hittman utilized the microblogging website Tumblr as part of the casting process for the film. Filming took place in the summer of 2012, lasting 18 days with a crew of 11 people.
Release
It Felt Like Love premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, and subsequently screened at such festivals as International Film Festival Rotterdam, Maryland Film Festival and Giffoni Film Festival. It was acquired by Variance Films in November 2013 for a limited theatrical release on March 21, 2014. The film was released on video by Kino Lorber on July 29, 2014.
Reception
It Felt Like Love received critical acclaim. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 84% based on 25 reviews. Writing for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis said the film is "a mood poem to summer loving and sexual awakening...powerfully [evoking] a time when flesh is paramount, and peer behavior is the standard by which we judge our own". She noted Hittman and cinematographer Sean Porter "remind us of the dangers of teenage desire and...the vast gulf between male and female notions of romantic connection".
Of the film, Inkoo Kang of the Los Angeles Times said, "Rarely has the zone between girlhood and womanhood been captured with such urgent honesty than in Eliza Hittman's superb teen drama...Hittman's debut isn't just a brilliantly tactile study of the mounting sexual curiosity and frustration of 14-year-old Lila (Gina Piersanti); it's also an important landmark in the oft-ignored subgenre of realistic movies about female adolescence".
Writing for RogerEbert.com, Matt Zoller Seitz praised the film as "tremendously accomplished", but also said the film falls short of a fuller character study.

A pituitary disease is a disorder primarily affecting the pituitary gland.
Table
The main disorders involving the pituitary gland are:
Overproduction or underproduction of a pituitary hormone will affect the respective end-organ. For example, insufficient production (hyposecretion) of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in the pituitary gland will cause hypothyroidism, while overproduction (hypersecretion) of TSH will cause hyperthyroidism. Thyroidisms caused by the pituitary gland are less common though, accounting for less than 10% of all hypothyroidism cases and much less than 1% of hyperthyroidism cases.

The Doombots are fictional robots appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
History
The Doombots are robots that are modeled after their creator Doctor Doom. They are exact replicas of the real Doctor Doom and were created to replace Doctor Doom in certain situations and were made with an advanced A.I. program which causes them to believe each is the real Doctor Doom, much in the same way as a Life Model Decoy. Doctor Doom designed two different types of replica: fighting Doombots and diplomat Doombots. They are used when Doctor Doom is not confident that he would win. All Doombots are programmed by Doctor Doom and include remote shut off in the case that one should rise against Doom himself. The Doombots first appear where they help to capture the Fantastic Four so that Doctor Doom can send Mister Fantastic, Human Torch, and Thing back in time to retrieve Blackbeard's treasure while he was using Invisible Woman as a hostage.
The Doombots later help Doctor Doom to capture Spider-Man, but accidentally captured Flash Thompson disguised as him.
The Doombots were present when Doctor Doom empowered three criminals to be the Terrible Trio.
During his plan to drive Doctor Doom out of Latveria, Prince Rudolfo has a woman named Ramona (who resembles Doctor Doom's childhood love Valeria) be picked up by a patrolling Doombot. Following the Doomsman that Doctor Doom had created coming to life, Doctor Doom sends the Doombots to deal with Prince Rudolfo and his men.
A Doombot in the form of Doctor Doom captured Arcade and the families of the X-Men so that the X-Men can come after Arcade. This caused the X-Men's Team 1 (consisting of Angel, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Storm, Wolverine) to go after Doctor Doom while Banshee, Havok, Iceman, and Polaris head to Murderworld to rescue the captive parents. This turned out to be a trap for Team 1 since the Doombot is actually in an alliance with Arcade. Arcade and the Doombot have designed the traps that the captive X-Men members are placed in. The captive family members at Murderworld turn out to be robots that attacks the X-Men members that were sent there. When Storm becomes one with the planet, she attacks the Doombot
Puppet Master later makes a doll of Doctor Doom as he controls Doctor Doom into sending his Doombots to attack the Fantastic Four.
Doctor Doom later sends his Doombots to abduct a heavily damaged "John Doe" from a Manhattan hospital. The "John Doe" turns out to be a depowered Terrax as Doctor Doom offers to help him regain his powers. While Human Torch and Thing are fighting Terrax, Invisible Woman encounters a Doombot in the form of Doctor Doom and easily destroys it.
Doctor Doom leads the Doombots into capturing Franklin Richards so that he can trade him to Mephisto in exchange for the soul of his mother Cynthia Von Doom.
During the Acts of Vengeance storyline, a Doombot was used by Doctor Doom to serve as his proxy at the time when Loki has gathered some criminal masterminds to help in his plot. The Doombot sent The Assembly of Evil to attack the Avengers at a press conference only for them to take on She-Hulk and Cloak and Dagger.
Silver Sable and the Wild Pack fought Doombots that were working for an Imposter Doctor Doom.
A Doombot later goes on a rampage in the city. When the Fantastic Four and the Avengers cannot be reached to deal with the situation, Code: Blue manages to take it down with help from the Yancy Street Gang.
A young boy named Billy hires Heroes for Hire to look for his missing robot Victor. Billy's robot Victor is actually a reprogrammed Doombot that has fallen under the control of the Headmen where they use it to attack Billy and Humbug. Victor the Doombot later attacks Heroes for Hire which results in the death of Orka.
Following the Civil War storyline, Doombot designed to look like Doctor Doom was built to appear at Stilt-Man's funeral.
During the Dark Reign storyline, Black Panther was meeting with Namor about joining the Cabal (which also consisted of Doctor Doom, Emma Frost, Hood, Loki, and Norman Osborn). When Black Panther refused the offer, he is attacked by Doctor Doom and the Doombots.
Doctor Doom later refits the Doombots to attack Donald Blake. Thor later fights a Doombot before he takes on Doctor Doom in a pilotable robot that is modeled after the Destroyer.
During the Siege storyline, Doctor Doom uses a Doombot to attend a meeting of the Cabal and speaks through it to demand that Norman Osborn ceases his campaign against Namor. When the Doombot is taken down by Taskmaster, it releases a robotic swarm that is unleashed upon Avengers Tower. Norman Osborn finds a way to shut down the robotic swarm as Sentry destroys the Doombot.
During the Infinity storyline, some Doombots are shown to work at the Latverian School of Science as teachers. There's even a female version of a Doombot that works there as well.
Avengers A.I.'s Doombot
Following the Age of Ultron storyline, Hank Pym was seen with the head of a Doombot as he starts to work on it. Pym controls it with the constant threat of releasing a micro black hole he implanted in its chest cavity. The Doombot reluctantly ends up joining Henry Pym's Avengers A.I. alongside Monica Chang, Victor Mancha and Vision. This Doombot is shown as ruler of Earth in a possible future, where it summons various Avengers from different time periods together to defeat Ultron's conquest of the world before taking control itself. However, the Avengers are able to defeat Doom's armies by rescuing the forces of Asgard from imprisonment, followed by Vision convincing the Doombot to explore its own identity and acknowledge Doom's more positive traits rather than just blindly following the original Victor von Doom's example and cheapening his legacy by letting another define his path. In another possible future, Dimitrios, born from the Ultron Anti-virus, destroys all humanity, Kree, Skulls, and Inhuman life. Only the Avenger's A.I. survive to resist him. In 12,000 A.D. they have one last battle on the carcass of Galactus. Doombot sacrifices himself when Dimitrios kills Victor Mancha, the only person he ever called "Pal", by releasing the black hole in his chest.
Vincent Doonan
Following Squirrel Girl's time travel paradox, an artificially intelligent Doombot escaped from Doctor Doom and became a well-adjusted member of society. The man who fixed him and gave him a new human face had a problem with superheroes and other “weird” events in the Marvel Universe, which the Doombot inherited. Although he lived for decades in a small suburb under the name Vincent Doonan, he had apparently secretly hired assassins to take out beings he considered strange, such as alien arms dealers. This led him to hire MODOK and then Gwenpool when she took over his organization. Gwen piqued his interest with her talk of her own world where such things never happen in real life, but Vincent decided she was weirder than the aliens and other "threats" and needed to die above all else as soon as he heard more about her world. He attempted to kill her, teaming up with the aliens he sent her to kill in the first place and kidnapping Gwen's co-workers and friends as hostages. He was ultimately beaten when Gwen threatened to blow up his neighbors if he did not turn on the aliens. Due to a misunderstanding, he was outed as a Doombot and given full credit for defeating the evil aliens, ruining his idealistic small town lifestyle.
Vincent has various weaponry, the ability to fly, anti-paranormal defense systems, artificial intelligence, and a red switch which will turn back on his Victor Von Doom personality if used. Gwen and her companions have repeatedly seen him on TV being touted as both a superhero and philanthropist since the loss of his secret identity. He, along with Spider-man Miles Morales and Gwen's friend The Terrible Eye were recently revealed to have possibly time travelled to the her first Christmas as part of a conspiracy to get Gwen's brother Teddy Poole to trap her before can she ruin their lives.
More recently Gwenpool decided to make a name for herself as a hero by taking down Dr. Doom, unaware that he was trying to be a hero himself. She used Vincent to track him down and while she was briefly imprisoned, Doom (whom Gwen thought was "Warmachine in a hoodie") and Vincent met. Although Vincent still does not like his creator, Doom told Vincent that he was very proud of the person the AI Doom-bot had become. Vincent helped Doom, Dr. Strange, and Terrible Eye perform a spell to return Gwen's sidekick Cecil to his human form and make his new monster body friendly. He later allows the current version of Squirrel Girl to examine him for her computer class, though the lesson is interrupted as she and Gwen go to Hell to save her brother from Mephisto.
Doombot Head
After Doom sent an army of Doombots to attack Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur she confiscated one of the heads and re-purposed it to running her lair when she was away. So far it has done so by making flawed robotic copies of her to fill in while she was off planet.
Powers
The Doombots are heavily armored robots that are resistant to mental, emotional, and illusion attacks. All Doombots can shoot lightning from their gauntlets similar to Doctor Doom's attack.
The Doombots sport jetpacks which can enable them to fly.
There are small mechanic limbs and tools in the head of every Doombot that allows them to re-construct the rest of the body. This allows the robot to infiltrate in enemy fortresses. The pieces are sent through a different way, and the head builds the body in minutes.
Doombots can be set to self-destruct whenever they are in risk of being captured or defeated, or at Doom's whim.
Doombot models
There were different models of the Doombots:
Diplomatic Doombots - These Doombots have a higher intelligence and normal armor levels. They lack the strength and reinforcement of the Fighting Doombots. Diplomatic Doombots are used in diplomatic meetings such as the United Nations and when dealing and/or negotiating with potential allies.
Fighting Doombots - These Doombots are enhanced with super strength and reinforced for direct combat, even being able to hold their own temporarily with Thing. Doctor Doom sends a fighting Doombot whenever he considers a fight probable, as they are equipped with heavier weaponry and more weapon systems than the diplomatic models. Most of these combat Doombots are so strong that enemies quickly realize they are not fighting the real Doom, a non-enhanced human.
AI Doombots - These Doombots can think for themselves and many believe that they are Doctor Doom. However their programming can be switched and they can act independently of Doom's will at times either for good or evil.
In other media
Television
The Doombots made unnamed appearances in the Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends episode "The Fantastic Mr. Frump".
The Doombots are merely the name of his robotic soldiers in Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes. They are armed with weapons designed to counter the powers of the Fantastic Four (i.e. ice cannons for the Human Torch, concussion lasers for the Invisible Woman, etc.). Eventually, Doom constructs a bot running on sophisticated Artificial Intelligence to the point it patterns on how organic brains operate. Aimed at adapting and learning how to defeat the FF, The Thing befriends the Doombot naming him "Bruiser".
The Doombots appear in The Super Hero Squad Show voiced by Charlie Adler.
The Doombots were mentioned as a joke in the Iron Man: Armored Adventures episode "The Might of Doom". A real Doombot was used in "Doomsday".
The Doombots appear in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode "The Private War of Doctor Doom".
The Doombots appear in Ultimate Spider-Man, voiced by Maurice LaMarche. They are equipped with fewer weapons than the Mark VI, with the only equipment being rocket launchers and are more agile. They were first seen when Spider-Man and his team invaded Latveria to defeat and capture Doctor Doom in hopes of being recognized by Fury.
The Doombots appear in the Avengers Assemble episode "The Serpent of Doom". The Avengers were attacked by Doombots and Doom Dogs, and they take them out until Doctor Doom bursts through the ground stating 'You dare trespass on Latverian soil!'.
The Doombots appear in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode "Days of Future Smash: The Dino Era". They are seen in the Latverian embassy guarding it while Doctor Doom is away. The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. fight through the Doombots at the time when Leader infiltrates the Latverian embassy to get to Doctor Doom's experimental time belts.

"Miracle of the Moment" is a song recorded by contemporary Christian singer and songwriter Steven Curtis Chapman. Written and produced by Chapman and Matt Bronleewe, it was released as the lead single from Chapman's 2007 studio album This Moment. Lyrically, the song challenges the listener to let go of their past regrets and live in the moment.
"Miracle of the Moment" received positive reviews from critics, several of whom praised the song's lyrical message, and it has been performed by Chapman on his concert tours. The song has been included on several compilation albums; an acoustic version has also been released. It peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot Christian AC chart and at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart, as well as at No. 3 on the Radio & Records Christian AC chart and at No. 4 on the Radio & Records INSPO chart.
Background and composition
According to Steven Curtis Chapman, the idea for "Miracle of the Moment" came out of a song he had written called "Find Me", which did not end up being included on This Moment. He reflected that he thought "God was just saying 'I really just want you to be present in this moment - the good ones, the bad ones - all that'". "Miracle of the Moment" was written and produced by Chapman and Matt Bronlewee. It was mixed by F. Reid Shippen and mastered by Ted Jensen.
"Miracle of the Moment" is a contemporary Christian song with a length of three minutes and twenty-eight seconds. It is set in common time in the key of A major and has a tempo of 84 beats per minute, with a vocal range spanning from the low note of F4 to the high note of E5. Chapman's vocal delivery on the song is "matured" and "slightly sandy", while the lyrics challenge the listener to let go of past regrets and to live in the moment.
Reception
Critical reception
"Miracle of the Moment" met with a positive critical reception upon the release of This Moment. John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout praised the song as "possibly the album's strongest offering" and said that its message is one "most everyone can gravitate towards". Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today commented that "Miracle of the Moment" sets up the message of This Moment, which he defined as "enjoying the God-given time we're blessed with". Deborah Evans Price of CCM Magazine regarded the song as a "meaningful anthem" and stated that it would "take its place alongside [Steven Curtis] Chapman classics such as 'For the Sake of the Call' and 'The Great Adventure'".

Yoel Rodríguez Oterino (born 28 August 1988), known simply as Yoel (), is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for SD Eibar as a goalkeeper.
He played 82 La Liga games for Celta, Valencia, Rayo Vallecano, Eibar and Valladolid, almost exclusively as back-up.
Club career
Celta
Born in Vigo, Pontevedra, Galicia, Yoel was a product of local RC Celta de Vigo's youth academy. He was promoted to the first team for the 2009–10 season, with the team in the Segunda División. On 10 February 2010, following a string of good performances in that year's Copa del Rey, he was called up to the Spain under-21 side training camp by manager Juan Ramón López Caro.
Yoel was first choice in the 2011–12, playing 25 games in a return to La Liga after five years. For the following campaign, however, he was loaned to neighbouring CD Lugo also in the second tier.
Yoel returned to Celta for 2013–14, making his top-flight debut on 19 August in a 2–2 home draw against RCD Espanyol.
Valencia
On 31 July 2014, Yoel was loaned to Valencia CF for one year, with the club having an obligatory option to buy him permanently at the end of this period. He made his competitive debut on 19 October, starting in the 3–0 away loss against Deportivo de La Coruña.
On 19 November 2015, after making no appearances during the season despite the injuries of both Diego Alves and Mathew Ryan, Yoel was loaned to Rayo Vallecano until June to make up for Toño's serious injury, with a buyout clause. On 20 December, he was in goal at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, but his team had to play with nine players for more than 60 minutes and were eventually crushed 10–2 by hosts Real Madrid.
Eibar
Yoel joined top-flight SD Eibar on 11 July 2016, on loan and again with an option to buy. On 23 May 2017, he agreed to a permanent deal for a reported €750,000.
In June 2017, Yoel suffered a knee ligament injury while exercising, ruling him out for six months. On 30 August 2018, having spent the remainder of the campaign as a backup to Marko Dmitrović, he renewed his contract until 2021 and was immediately loaned to Real Valladolid for one year. He spent most of that season on the bench behind Jordi Masip, and when chosen to play against Deportivo Alavés on 19 April 2019, he made errors in a 2–2 away draw.
In December 2020, having not recovered his position from the Serb, Yoel extended his link until June 2024. The following summer, as the former moved to Sevilla FC, Ander Cantero arrived as competition at the relegated Basque club.

The Phelan Medal is an annual award given in the Sydney AFL. It is awarded to best and fairest player of the Premier Division competition each year and is named after former NSW League official James (Jim) E. Phelan (1860–1939). It is seen to be the Sydney AFL equivalent to the Brownlow Medal.
The best and fairest player in the Sydney League was first presented an unnamed award in 1926. In 1932, Mr Aub D.S. Provan, the NSW Australian National Football League president donated a trophy titled the "Provan Trophy" to the winner. The name was changed to the Phelan Medal in 1937.
Due to the cancellation of the 2021 AFL Sydney season due to the COVID-19 outbreak across Greater Sydney, the medal was not awarded in 2021.

STADIUM (Software for Transport and Degradation In Unsaturated Materials) is a or service life prediction method which uses finite element software in conjunction with certified lab testing to determine the service life of exposed reinforced concrete.
Development
SUMMA
STADIUM was originally developed in the late 1990s for in-house use by SIMCO Technologies, then an engineering firm specialised in the aging of concrete structures. STADIUM uses time-step finite element analysis to simulate the progress of harmful ions (including chloride, sulphate, and hydroxide) through concrete, by considering the chemical and physical properties of the concrete being analysed.
As the US Navy needed a tool to accurately predict the degradation of waterfront concrete structures, SIMCO Technologies and its U.S. partner, the RJLee Group, were awarded Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) funds from the US Navy for a Phase I feasibility study in 2002. In 2003, Phase II funds were awarded to the team to fully integrate chloride ingress and corrosion initiation prediction in STADIUM. Several industrial partners also joined this effort: Lafarge, Holcim, Euclid, BASF, Sika, MMFX, and Grace Chemicals. The consortium was called SUMMA.
The main outcomes of this research phase were:
Integration of ionic exchange in the chemical module to model chloride binding.
Determination of the chloride corrosion threshold based on the modified G109 test procedure (some of these tests are still ongoing).
Integration of temperature effects in the model.
Determination of transport properties for more than 20 concrete mixtures.
Development of a Graphical User Interface for STADIUM.
SUMMA2
STADIUM development continued with the second phase of the SUMMA research program (SUMMA2), leading to the commercialisation of STADIUM 2.9 to coincide with the specification of STADIUM service life modelling for new waterfront constructions for the US Navy.
STADIUM 2.99
STADIUM 2.99 is currently the most recent build of the STADIUM client. Being a web-based program, a user's files are accessible from any other computer with the STADIUM 2.99 client installed, and requires a secure username and password to access.
STADIUM Lab
As the STADIUM model relies on laboratory testing, STADIUM Lab is the software component required by concrete laboratories in order to characterize concrete for use in STADIUM, as well as service life quality control. Only labs accredited by SIMCO Technologies are qualified to perform STADIUM Lab testing.
Applications
STADIUM has been used as quality control for US Navy projects such as the Kilo Wharf extension project in Guam, the Modular Hybrid Pier, and evaluations of the Pearl Harbor Dry Docks.
State Departments of Transport have also begun using STADIUM, such as the NJDOT's use of STADIUM for analysis of the Route 21 Southbound Viaduct in Newark, New Jersey.

The Mr. Christie's Book Awards () was a Canadian literary prize awarded by Christie, Brown & Company, a division of Nabisco. The awards were discontinued in 2004. The awards were generally considered to be the "Giller Prize for children's authors".
History
The awards were established to promote excellence in Canadian children's literature. The recipients were required to be Canadian citizens or permanent residents. The prize was first awarded in 1990. Initially, awards were given for text and illustrations in English and French language books, a total of four categories. In 1993, the categories for text were divided based on age: one for ages 8 or less and one for ages 9 to 14. In 1994, it was decided that text and illustrations would no longer be judged separately and the number of age categories was increased to three: age 7 and under, ages 8 to 11 and ages 12 to 16.

Golden Opinion (23 February 1986 – after 2007) was an American-bred French-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. In a racing career which lasted less than six months she won four of her six races. As a three-year-old in 1996 she won a Listed race on her debut and then finished third in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains before winning the Prix de Sandringham at Chantilly and the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. She was narrowly beaten in the July Cup and ended her career with a six length win in the Prix du Rond Point. After being retired from racing she came a broodmare and produced several minor winners.
Background
Golden Opinion was a chestnut filly with white socks on her front feet bred in Kentucky by her owner, Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. She was from the first crop of foals sired by Slew o' Gold an outstanding performer on dirt in the United States who won Eclipse Awards in 1983 and 1984. Golden Opinion was the first foal of her dam Optimistic Lass who showed top-class form in a brief racing career, winning the Musidora Stakes and the Nassau Stakes in 1984. She later produced Joyful, the grand-dam of the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Samitar. Golden Opinion was sent to Europe and entered training with André Fabre in France. She was ridden in all of her races by Cash Asmussen.
Racing career
1989: three-year-old season
Golden Opinion was unraced as a two-year-old and never contested a maiden race, beginning her racing career with a win in the Listed Prix Montenica over 1600 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 21 April. She was then stepped up to Group One class for the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches at Longchamp Racecourse on 14 May. She turned into the straight in fourth place before taking the lead 200 metres from the finish but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third behind Pearl Bracelet and the Cheveley Park Stakes winner Pass the Peace. The unplaced runners included Tersa (Prix Morny), Oczy Czarnie (Prix de la Salamandre) and Mary Linoa (Prix Marcel Boussac). On 4 June, the filly started 3/5 favourite for the Group Three Prix de Sandringham at Chantilly Racecourse and won by three quarters of a length from Bubbling Danseuse.
Seventeen days after her win at Chantilly, Golden Opinion was sent to England to contest the 140th renewal of the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot. She was made the 7/2 favourite in a twelve-runners field which included Tessla (Fillies' Mile), Aldbourne (third in the 1000 Guineas) and Comic Talent, the winner of her last five races. Asmussen tracked the leaders and was third on the final turn before making a challenge in the straight. Golden Opinion overtook the outsider Magic Gleam inside the final furlong and won by half a length, with a gap of four lengths back to Guest Artiste in third place. She was the first French-trained winner of the race since Barbaresque in 1960. In July the filly was dropped in distance as well as being matched against colts and older horses when he returned to England to contest the Group One July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Racing against specialised sprinters she started 11/4 second favourite behind the colt Danehill. She appeared to be outpaced in the early stages but finished strongly and failed by only a head to catch the four-year-old Cadeaux Genereux. Danehill was two and a half lengths away in third.
After a late summer break, Golden Opinion returned in the Group Three Prix du Rond-Point over 1600 metres at Longchamp on 8 October. Starting the 2/5 favourite against eight opponents, she took the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win "easily" by six lengths.
Assessment
In the official International Classification for 1989, Golden Opinion was the top-rated female racehorse of any age in Europe.
Breeding record
After her retirement from racing, Golden Opinion became a broodmare for her owner's Darley Stud. She produced at least ten foals and five minor winners between 1991 and 2007:
Sun Music, a bay colt, foaled in 1991, sired by Sadler's Wells. Failed to win in two races.
Legal Opinion, bay filly, 1993, by Polish Precedent. Failed to win in two races.
Meiosis, bay filly, 1997, by Danzig. Won one race.
Dareen, chestnut filly, 1998, by Rahy. Failed to win in two races.
Goddess of Wisdom, bay filly, 1999, by Sadler's Wells. Won one race.
Excellento, chestnut colt (later gelded), 2000, by Rahy. Won three races.

Two human polls comprised the 1983 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I-A football rankings. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.

The Innere Neustadt (Inner New City) is a neighborhood in Dresden within the administrative district of Neustadt. The name is derived from "Neue Königliche Stadt" (New Royal City), the name given to the former district of Altendresden when it was rebuilt after a fire before 1732. In contrast to the Äußere Neustadt (Outer New City), the Innere Neustadt was within the city fortifications and, for that reason, is also known as the historic Neustadt. Its population is 7,761 (2020).
Location
The Innere Neustadt is located in the administrative district of Neustadt, across the Elbe and to the north of the Innere Altstadt (Inner Old City).
The River Elbe forms an enclosing arc around the Innere Neustadt. Four bridges cross the Elbe, connecting the district with the southern bank of the Elbe. Of these, only Augustusbrucke is historic. The streets leading to these bridges cross the Innere Neustadt and join at Albertplatz (Albert Place), at the northern end of the district (originally called Bautzner Platz).
Cultural and architectural features
Culturally (since the reunification of 1989) Neustadt has been associated with counter-culture and anti-authoritarianism, typified by a very high level of street art and graffiti, which greatly characterises the typical local street scene.
Several of Dresden's cultural institutions and museums lie within the Innere Neustadt. To the north, at Albertplatz is the Erich Kästner Museum, and, to the south, housed in the Japanisches Palais (Japanese Palace), is the State Museum of Ethnology. On the Hauptstraße (High Street) are the Dresden Soccer Museum, the Kügelgenhaus, and the Museum of Dresden Romanticism. In Rähnitzgasse is the Kunsthaus Dresden (Dresden Art House) and close by the Societaetstheater (Society Theatre). The Jägerhof is the home of the Museum for Saxon Folk Art and the Puppet Theater Collection of the State Art Collections.
Major cultural events include: the City Festival, held mainly on Hauptstraße; and the Filmnächte (Movie Nights), which take place on the flood plain of the Elbe (the "Elbe Meadows") in the summer.
Innere Neustadt also contains many important buildings as part of Dresden. The reconstruction of the neighborhood until 1732 was carried out in baroque style. Baroque town houses can still be found mainly on Königstraße. One of the buildings unchanged since 1733 is number 13 in Großen Meißner Straße ('Large Meissen Road'). The historically important complex of buildings survived the wartime destruction of Dresden and now forms the central part of what is currently the Hotel Bellevue.
The Dreikönigskirche, destroyed and rebuilt several times, was the seat of the Saxon parliament from 1990 to 1993. Along the banks of the river Elbe is the government buildings of the so-called 'government quarter' and the Japanisches Palais.
The very famous statue of August the Strong (known locally as the Golden Rider) stands at the south end of the Hauptstrasse. On Albertplatz is the artesian well. The largest fully automatic public parking garage is in the Innere Neustadt.
Second World War
The destruction within Neustadt in February 1945 was extensive but not as comprehensive as within the Altstadt to the south. Rebuilding respected the original street pattern but, whilst respectful in terms of height, is architecturally typical of the 1960s and does not reflect Dresden's original character. The Hauptstrasse in particular shows little evidence of its history. The western district around Königstrasse survived more successfully and retains the majority of its historic character.
Until February 1945, the large Neustädter Rathaus (New City Town Hall) was on Neustädter Markt. After its destruction the Rathaus was not rebuilt, a Plattenbau complex taking its place instead. An initiative has been founded with the goal of reconstructing the Rathaus and restoring the Neustädter Markt.
Traffic and Infrastructure
The most important streets are: the Hauptstraße (a pedestrian street), connecting to the Augustusbrucke (Augustus Bridge); Albertstraße, connecting to the Carolabrucke (Charles Bridge); and Königstraße. Secondary streets include Antonstraße (the extension of the Marien Bridge), Bautzner Straße, and Große Meißner Straße.
A total of eight trams run in the district on two east-west and three north-south routes. The most important tram hub is Albertplatz. Except for bus line 81, which connects to the Innere Neustadt at the Neustadt train station, no city bus lines service the district, only regional buses.
The Innere Neustadt is bordered in the west by the railway arches holding the rail line connecting Dresden to Leipzig. The train station Dresden-Neustadt in the northwest of the district is served by local and long-distance trains.
Business and Government
Key economic sectors of the Innere Neustadt are gastronomy and retail. As in the Innere Altstadt, many hotels and restaurants are located in this part of the inner city. The largest hotel is Hotel Bellevue, of the Westin hotel chain. Both Königstraße and Hauptstraßse are important shopping districts in the center of Dresden.
The State Chancellery and all ministries of the Free State of Saxony are centered on Carolaplatz, forming the government district. Currently, there are eight ministries in historical as well as newly constructed buildings. The State Archives are also located in the government district.
The local office for the entire Neustadt (Innere and Äußere) is located in this part of town.

The Dutch Trio (Das Holländische Trio) was a musical ensemble for chamber music, consisting of Coenraad Valentijn Bos (piano), Joseph Maurits van Veen (violin) and Jacques van Lier (cello), that was very successful in Berlin between 1899 and 1910 because of their tasteful choice of repertoire and careful interpretation. The piano trio gave performances throughout Germany and also in Italy, France, the Netherlands and Denmark.
Career
Van Veen had played with Bos since 1897 in a duo for piano and violin and with Van Lier in a string quartet. The three men united in 1899 to form "Das Holländische Trio". They made their debut on April 28, 1899 in Berlin with a concert dedicated in its entirety to the works of Eduard Behm. In the fall of 1899, they also made their debut in the Netherlands.
In Berlin on December 4, 1899, the Dutch Trio performed during a fundraiser benefiting the cause of the Boer during the Second Boer War. The musical part of the event was very successful, according to critics, especially because of the Dutch Trio's performance of Mozart´s piano trio nr.2 in G major K 496.
On January 10, 1902, the "Trio Hollandais" made their debut in Paris, in the Nouvelle Societé Philharmonique, playing the Piano trio nr. 3 by Brahms and Mozart's piano trio mentioned earlier. The critic praised their uniform sound and faithful reproduction.
In his memoirs, Bos recalls that the famous violinist Joseph Joachim, Van Veen's teacher, wrote a very positive letter about the trio's concert in the hall of the Berlin University of the Arts in March, 1903. Joachim himself and Emanuel Wirth were invited as guests to play with the Dutch Trio Brahms' Piano quintet.
In January 1904, "Il trio olandese" visited Venice resulting in two well-received concerts in La Fenice.
On March 16, 1906, the Dutch Trio performed in the Singakademie in Berlin together with the mezzo-soprano Julia Culp and three other singers. The concert was dedicated to Beethoven´s arrangement of Welsh and Scottish songs (such as The Cottage Maid and Faithful Johnnie). As an intermezzo, Beethoven´s piano trio op. 70/2 was played.
At a concert dedicated to the tenor Ludwig Wūllner, as part of his tour of 18 performances in the Netherlands with Coenraad Bos, the Dutch Trio played on October 31, 1906 for the first time in the Concertgebouw. Together with the Concertgebouworkest conducted by Willem Mengelberg the Triple concerto by Beethoven was performed. De Tijd was full of praise about Bos but expressed doubts about the other two members of the ensemble.
The acclaim endured in Berlin according to a review in 1908 that describes a very highly regarded trio that had been active for ten years. In particular, cellist Jacques Van Lier was commended. However, the solo capabilities of the other two musicians did not completely convince Het Nieuws van den Dag.
In March 1908, the Dutch Trio gave two concerts in the Casino in Copenhagen that caused an uproar. After the first concert, Politiken had written that Van Veen was a dilettante. Before starting the second concert, Van Veen insisted that the correspondent of the newspaper exit the hall before they would play even a single note. Van Veen gained support for this demand from the audience, forcing the reporter to leave.
In the winter of 1908-1909, Marcellus van Gool replaced pianist Bos, who was traveling in the United States. Later in 1909, Van Veen left the trio to settle in the Hague. He was replaced by the German violinist Hugo Heermann.
The last mention of the Dutch Trio of Bos, Van Veen or Van Lier in a Dutch newspaper is on December 13, 1910. It was reported that a tour of the trio in Spain could not take place because Bos had broken his leg. The commitments in Spain were taken on by the newly formed Heermann-Van Lier String Quartet with Maxim Ronis (second violin) and Ernst Breest (altviolin), who traveled to Spain after their concerts in Vienna and Paris.
After 1910
In 1911, the name of the Dutch Trio was used by an entirely different piano trio, consisting of Jeannette Mossel-Belinfante (piano), Aldo Antonietti (violin) and Isaäc Mossel (cello), later known as the Trio Mossel. Another piano trio used the name in 1913: Johan Hoorenman (piano), Willem Gerke (violin) and Bertram Drilsma (cello). The name was subsequently used many times, and not only by piano trios.
The success of the piano trio with Bos, Van Veen and Van Lier between 1899 and 1910 probably helped popularize the name. In fiction the name "Dutch Trio" is used to signify success in music. In the novel Julian by Elisabeth Overduyn-Heyligers published circa 1916, the main character of the same name is a young violinist living in Berlin. He starts to receive notice after he is asked to play as a substitute in The Dutch Trio. Rinke Tolman wrote a devastating critique of the novel.
Dedicated works
Several composers have dedicated works to the Dutch Trio:
Christian Sinding: Piano trio nr. 2
Philipp Scharwenka: his Piano trio opus 112
Eduard Behm: Piano trio op. 14
Hugo Kaun: Piano trio nr. 2 opus 58.

A hazmat suit (hazardous materials suit) is a piece of personal protective equipment that consists of an impermeable whole-body garment worn as protection against hazardous materials. Such suits are often combined with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) to ensure a supply of breathable air. Hazmat suits are used by firefighters, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, researchers, personnel responding to toxic spills, specialists cleaning up contaminated facilities, and workers in toxic environments.
History
The hazmat suit is believed to originate from the Manchurian plague epidemic of 1910–1911, wherein Dr. Wu Lien-teh's promoted the use of various forms of personal protective equipment to prevent the spread of the pneumonic plague.
Capabilities
Overview
The United States Department of Homeland Security defines a hazmat suit as "an overall garment worn to protect people from hazardous materials or substances, including chemicals, biological agents, or radioactive materials." More generally, hazmat suits may provide protection from:
Chemical agents through the use of appropriate barrier materials like teflon, heavy PVC or rubber and Tyvek
Nuclear agents possibly through radiation shielding in the lining, but more importantly by preventing direct contact with or inhalation of radioactive particles or gas
Biological agents through fully sealed systems—often at overpressure to prevent contamination even if the suit is damaged or using powered air purifying respirators with full hoods and protective suits to prevent exposure (level C protection level)
Fire/high temperatures usually by a combination of insulating and reflective materials which reduce the effects (see also Fire proximity suit)
The hazmat suit generally includes breathing air supplies to provide clean, uncontaminated air for the wearer. In laboratory use, clean air may be supplied through attached hoses. This air is usually pumped into the suit at positive pressure with respect to the surroundings as an additional protective measure against the introduction of dangerous agents into a potentially ruptured or leaking suit.
Working in a hazmat suit is very strenuous, as the suits tend to be less flexible than conventional work garments. With the exception of laboratory versions, hazmat suits can be hot and poorly ventilated (if at all). Therefore, use is usually limited to short durations of up to 2 hours, depending on the difficulty of the work. Level A (United States) suits, for example, are limited by their air supply to around 15–20 minutes of very strenuous work (such as a firefighting rescue in a building).
However, OSHA/EPA protective level A suits/ensembles are not typically used in firefighting rescue, especially during a building/structure fire. National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) compliant "turnout gear", and NIOSH-certified SCBA, or CBRN SCBA, are the primary protection technologies for structure firefighting in the US.
Ratings
In the United States
Hazmat protective clothing is classified as any of Level A, B, C, or D, based upon the degree of protection they provide.
Level A The highest level of protection against vapors, gases, mists, and particles is Level A, which consists of a fully encapsulating chemical entry suit with a full-facepiece self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). A person must also wear boots with steel toes and shanks on the outside of the suit and specially selected chemical-resistant gloves for this level of protection. The breathing apparatus is worn inside (encapsulated within) the suit. To qualify as Level A protection, an intrinsically safe two-way radio is also worn inside the suit, often incorporating voice-operated microphones and an earpiece speaker for monitoring the operations channel.
Level B protection requires a garment (including SCBA) that provides protection against splashes from a hazardous chemical. Since the breathing apparatus is sometimes worn on the outside of the garment, Level B protection is not vapor-protective. Level B suits can also be fully encapsulating, which helps prevent the SCBA from becoming contaminated. It is worn when vapor-protective clothing (Level A) is not required. Wrists, ankles, facepiece and hood, and waist are secured to prevent any entry of splashed liquid. Depending on the chemical being handled, specific types of gloves and boots are donned. These may or may not be attached to the garment. The garment itself may be one piece or a two-piece hooded suit. Level B protection also requires the wearing of chemical-resistant boots with steel toes and shanks on the outside of the garment. As with Level A, chemical-resistant gloves and two-way radio communications are also required.
Level C protection differs from Level B in the area of equipment needed for respiratory protection. The same type of garment used for Level B protection is worn for Level C. Level C protection allows for the use of respiratory protection equipment other than SCBA. This protection includes any of the various types of air-purifying respirators. People should not use this level of protection unless the specific hazardous material is known and its concentration can be measured. Level C equipment does not offer the protection needed in an oxygen deficient atmosphere.
Level D protection does not protect the person from chemical exposure. Therefore, this level of protection can only be used in situations where a person has no possibility of contact with chemicals. A pair of coveralls or other work-type garment along with chemical-resistant footwear with steel toes and shanks are all that is required to qualify as Level D protection. Most firefighter turnout gear is considered to be Level D.
In Europe
Most suits used in Europe are covered by a set EU Norms, and divided into a total of six types (levels) of protection:
Type 1: Protects against liquid and gaseous chemicals. Gas tight. (EN 943 part 1). More or less equivalent to US level A.
Type 2: Protects against liquid and gaseous chemicals. Non gas tight. (EN 943 part 1). More or less equivalent to US level B.1
Type 3: Protects against liquid chemicals for a limited period. Liquid jet tight. (EN 14605)
Type 4: Protects against liquid chemicals for a limited period. Liquid saturation tight. (EN 14605). More or less equivalent to US level C.
Type 5: Protects against airborne dry particulates for a limited period. (EN ISO 13982-1).
Type 6: Protects against a light spray of liquid chemicals (EN 13034). More or less equivalent to US level D.
1: Can be used in places where the chemical in gaseous form isn't harmful to the body exterior.
GOST System
In the GOST system of norms, EN 943 is equivalent to GOST 12.4.284.2-2014.
In Brazil
Following the American standards, there are 4 different types of suits, from A to D. The suits are known to the Brazilian military as Roupa Protetora Permeável de Combate (Protective Permeable Combat Clothing). There are within the Brazilian military several specialized hazmat regiments. The regiments were deployed during the FIFA 2014 World Cup, 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Types
Hazmat suits come in two variations: splash protection and gastight suits. The splash protection suits are designed to prevent the wearer from coming into contact with a liquid. These suits do not protect against gases or dust. Gastight suits additionally protect against gases and dust.
Gas/vapor protection
Such suits (level A in the US) are gas or vapor-tight, providing total encapsulation and the highest level of protection against direct and airborne chemical contact. They are typically worn with a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) enclosed within the suit.
These suits are typically constructed of several layers and, being airtight, include a release valve so the suit does not overinflate from air exhaled by the SCBA. The release valve does retain some air to keep some positive pressure ("overpressure") inside the suit. As noted, such suits are usually limited to just 15–20 minutes of use by their mobile air supply.
With each suit described here, there is a manufactured device designed to protect the respiratory system of the wearer (called a respirator) while the suit/ensemble is used to protect skin exposed to potential hazardous dermal agents. A respirator may be something as simple as a headband strap filtering facepiece respirator (FFR); to a head harness negative pressure full face respirator (air-purifying respirator/APR); to a full face, tight fitting, closed breathing air; or open circuit, self-contained breathing apparatus (CC-SCBA or SCBA).
Splash protection
Such suits (level B in the US) are not vapor-tight and thus provide a lesser level of protection. They are, however, worn with an SCBA, which may be located inside or outside of the suit, depending on the type of suit (encapsulating or non-encapsulating). They more closely resemble the one-piece Tyvek coveralls often seen used in construction and demolition work. Yet, Level B splash suits may also be fully encapsulating suits which are simply not airtight.
Lesser protection (level C in the US) suits may be coveralls of treated material, or multi-piece combinations, sealed with tape. This kind of protection is still "proof" against many non-invasive substances, such as anthrax.

Sev Berd or Black Fortress (; , Chornaya Krepost) is an abandoned Russian imperial fortress in Gyumri, Shirak Province, Armenia. The fortress, which lies from the Turkish border, was built in response to the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829. It is a national cultural heritage monument in Armenia.
History
Gyumri, which lies on the border with Turkey, became part of the Russian Empire after the Treaty of Gulistan. Gyumri was renamed Alexandropol in 1837 after the visit of Tsar Nicholas I, in honor of his wife, Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna.
The fortress was built on top of a hill, and the full fortification took a decade after the first stones were laid in 1834. The fortress is a 360-degree round structure made of black stone, from which it gets its name. After Russia's loss in the Crimean War, Sev Berd was upgraded and designated a "first-class" fortress. It never underwent a siege, but was of strategic importance in victories over the Turks in subsequent wars that lasted through 1878. The fortress was downgraded to "second-class" status in 1887, after the final Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 that saw Russia gain strongholds in Kars and Batumi.
The Russian 102nd Military Base was built in the 1940s next to Sev Berd. The base remains active today for the Russian military, which provides national defense support for Armenia.
Current status
The fortress was purchased by the Balasanyan family in 2012. Owner Misak Balasanyan intends to turn Sev Berd into a tourist attraction.
Archeological efforts are ongoing at the site.

Odile Burluraux is a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, Paris (MAM), organizing large group shows at the institution that have included international artists since the 1990s. She started as an intern at MAM, curating her first exhibition in 1995, working with musician Arnold Schoenberg's paintings.
For Burluraux, curating is a way of bringing together artworks and contributing to the public reception of them. In 2019, 300 works by Hans Hartung were shown in Paris the first time since 1969, organized by Burluraux with the help of her assistant, Julie Sissa, resulting in La Fabrique du Geste, a major retrospective.
In 2021, Burluraux curated The Power of My Hands, which showed works by 16 women artists living in the African continent and the African diaspora. The show was organized in collaboration with Angola-based writer and curator, Suzana Sousa, and addressed issues that have long been prominent in women's lives, including the female body, self-representation, sexuality, motherhood, beliefs, and empowerment. The same year, the curator partnered with the ASIA NOW Art Fair, to feature Iranian galleries for the first time, including film projects by ten Iranian women artists, exploring migration, identity, and female subjectivities.

Battle Hill Farm Forest Park is a regional park near Paekakariki, in the Kapiti Coast District and Wellington Region of New Zealand's lower North Island.
The park is a dedicated farm park, administered by Wellington Regional Council. Transmission Gully runs through the park.
Geography
The reserve covers a stream valley, between Paekakariki Hill and Horokiri stream to the west, and hills to the east. It includes steep hill slopes of greywacke with limits vegetation.
The vegetation in the valley includes pukatea (Laurelia novaezelandiae), along with some rewarewa (Knightia excelsa), tawa (Beilschmeidia tawa), and kahikatea (Dacrydium dacrydioides). The understory includes mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus), kaikomako (Pennantia corymbosa), nikau (Rhopalostylis sapida), coprosma, and other small trees and shrubs.
History
Battle Hill Farm Forest Park was the site of Battle Hill in 1846. Relations between the Government and local Māori had been souring for many years, due to the New Zealand Company trying to buy large tracts of land for Pākehā settlers. It culminated with a clash between about 300 Ngāti Toa, under the leadership of Te Rangihaeata, and British troops.
Te Rangihaeata was captured and relinquished the land in return for his release. He spent the rest of his life in exile at Poroutawhao, north of Levin.
In 1860 the bush was covered to the Abbott family, who cleared it and farmed it until 1975. Members of the family, and two of the three militiamen killed in the battle of 1946, are buried in a graveyard on the site.
Wellington Regional Council purchased the land for a park in 1987.
Access routes into the park were changed, during construction of Transmission Gully between 2016 and 2021.
The council consulted on the future of the park in 2020.
Later that year, the council announced plans to reduce stock grazing and increase native bush and wetlands in its regional parks. However, it excluded Battle Hill Farm Forest Park from the plan, opting to keep it as a dedicated farm park.
Recreation
The park contains a working farm near the entrance at Paekakariki Hill Road and extends over the surrounding hills and into a plantation forest that merges with the Akatarawa Forest. It contains several loop walkways, some suitable for mountain biking and horse riding.
Parts of the park are closed during August for lambing season.
The park is open to camping and campervans. However, there is no powered camping sites or dump stations.
Wellington Riding for the Disabled, a community group providing horse therapy for people with disabilities, has been operating in the park since 2016.
The park is a ten minute drive from parts of Porirua.

Art gallery owner Susan Morrow receives the manuscript for a novel penned by her estranged ex-husband Edward Sheffield along with an invitation for dinner during Edward's upcoming visit to Los Angeles. Upset by her deteriorating marriage to unfaithful businessman Hutton Morrow, Susan becomes consumed by the novel, which is both dedicated to her and named Nocturnal Animals after Edward's nickname for her.
In the novel, Tony Hastings is a family man who runs afoul of three local troublemakers – Ray Marcus, Lou, and Turk – during a road trip through West Texas. After being forced off the road, Tony is powerless to stop Ray and Turk from kidnapping his wife, Laura, and their daughter, India, and leaving him with Lou, who forces him to drive Ray's car to the end of a road where he is abandoned. Tony manages to evade Ray and Lou when they return looking for him and makes his way to a nearby farmhouse to call the police.
Detective Roberto "Bobby" Andes is assigned to the case and, with Tony, discovers the bodies of Laura and India near an abandoned shack, where they had been raped and murdered. Tony is wracked with guilt. He is contacted by the Andes a year later and is asked to identify Lou, who is charged as an accomplice in the murders of Laura and India.
Turk has been fatally shot in a botched robbery, leaving Ray as the final culprit to be brought to justice. Andes arrests Ray, but is ultimately forced to release him as they have only circumstantial evidence of his involvement. On the verge of retirement and having been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, Andes decides to take matters into his own hands and, with Tony's help, abducts Ray and Lou. Andes shoots Lou dead when he attempts to flee, but Ray escapes.
On his own, Tony tracks down Ray to the shack where Laura and India were killed. Ray admits to raping and murdering Tony's wife and daughter, calling him weak. Tony fatally shoots him, but is blinded when Ray hits him on the head with a fire poker. Tony stumbles outside and dies after falling on his gun, shooting himself in the abdomen in the process.
Shocked by the dark content and raw emotion of the novel, Susan reminisces about meeting Edward in college and their blossoming relationship, which Susan's domineering mother Anne Sutton objected to, claiming that Edward was not worthy of Susan's affections and that because of his romantic worldviews, he lacked the drive to actually achieve his goals; Susan ignored her mother's objections, eventually marrying Edward.
After finding further evidence of Hutton's extramarital affair, Susan resumes her reading of the manuscript and begins to recall her troubled marriage to Edward, which was strained by her frustration with his fledgling career and her dismissive attitude towards his literary aspirations, and culminated with Susan cheating on him with Hutton and divorcing Edward to marry him. Edward attempted to repair their relationship, but ultimately cut ties with Susan upon learning that she was pregnant with his child but secretly had an abortion to ensure an end to any attachment with him.
In the present day, Susan finishes reading the novel and arranges a meeting with Edward at a restaurant. Edward does not show up, and Susan waits alone as the restaurant empties.

Production
On March 24, 2015, it was announced that Smokehouse Pictures' partners George Clooney and Grant Heslov would produce a thriller, Nocturnal Animals, based on Austin Wright's 1993 novel Tony and Susan. Tom Ford was set to direct the film, based on his own script. Ford said that the storytelling concept of the novel appealed to him, explaining, "The film is very different than the book it's based on. However, the central themes are the same, meaning that when I read the book, what appealed to me as a writer and a filmmaker was the idea of this device of communicating to someone through a work of fiction. Through a written work of fiction. And thereby communicating something that they had not been able to really communicate clearly. I loved that concept."
Jake Gyllenhaal was set to star in the dual lead roles, Amy Adams was in talks for the female lead role, and sources confirmed that Joaquin Phoenix and Aaron Taylor-Johnson might be cast in other roles. Focus Features acquired the US distribution rights to the film on May 17, 2015, while Universal Pictures handles the international distribution. Focus' deal was made with $20 million, making this the biggest deal of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, and one of the biggest of the mid 2010s. On August 6, 2015, Taylor-Johnson was confirmed to play a mysterious character who poses a threat to Gyllenhaal's character Tony's family, while Michael Shannon was also added to the cast, playing a detective investigating the violent incident. On August 28, 2015, Armie Hammer also joined the cast of the film, to play Hutton Morrow, Adams' character's husband. On September 9, 2015, Isla Fisher joined the film to play Laura Hastings, Tony's wife. On September 18, 2015, Ellie Bamber was cast in the film to play Tony's daughter. On September 30, 2015, Robert Aramayo was added to the cast. On October 5, 2015, Karl Glusman signed on to star in the film. On October 8, 2015, Peter Nyong'o was also cast in the film.
Principal photography on the film began on October 5, 2015, in Los Angeles. The final scene in the Japanese restaurant was filmed in the main building of the Yamashiro Historic District. It wrapped on December 5, 2015.
Release
Nocturnal Animals had its world premiere at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival on September 2, 2016. The film also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2016, and at the BFI London Film Festival on October 14, 2016.
The film was released in the United States on November 18, 2016.
Reception
Box office
Nocturnal Animals grossed $10.7 million in the United States and Canada and $20.5 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $31.2 million.
The film had its North American wide release on December 9, 2016, and was projected to open to $3–5 million. It ended up grossing $3.2 million, finishing 7th at the box office.
Critical response
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 302 reviews, with an average rating of 7.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Well-acted and lovely to look at, Nocturnal Animals further underscores writer-director Tom Ford's distinctive visual and narrative skill." On Metacritic, the film has a score of 67 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Owen Gleiberman of Variety praised the film, stating "Tom Ford's first film since A Single Man is another winner", and complimenting the performances of Gyllenhaal, Adams, Shannon and Taylor-Johnson. Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood praised Adams, Gyllenhaal, Shannon, and Taylor-Johnson's performances, as well as Ford's screenplay and direction.
Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent awarded the film five stars, praising the performances and the direction, and stating, "Nocturnal Animals is extraordinarily deft in the way it combines romanticism and bleakness. It's a film that easily could have slipped into extreme pretentiousness but it never puts a foot wrong."
Victoria Coren Mitchell of The Guardian opposed the popular critical opinion, saying "Why all these raves and prizes for a piece of gynophobic death-porn?"

Thomas "Tully" Craig (1897 – 30 January 1963) was a Scottish footballer who is best known for his time with Rangers, and also played for Celtic earlier in his career. He was a versatile player who could play up front, in midfield or defence.
Playing career
Born in Laurieston and with links to the small town of Tullibody from which his nickname derived, Craig was signed by Celtic from Junior side Grange Rovers in June 1919 and made his first team debut for the club in a 3–2 league win at Kilmarnock on 17 January 1920. The left-half impressed on his debut, scoring two goals, but he was deemed to be too lightweight by manager Willie Maley and consequently spent most of his time at Celtic Park in the reserves.
Maley was only too pleased to offload the player to Alloa Athletic in an exchange deal which saw Craig and two other Celts swapped for Willie Crilley. While Crilley would disappoint in the Hoops, Craig was a huge success at Alloa, so much so that after only one season Rangers bought him for a fee of seven hundred and fifty pounds.
In eleven years at Ibrox Craig played a significant role in seven Scottish League title-winning campaigns and was involved in three more to a smaller degree, won two Scottish Cups in 1928 and 1930 (also playing in the 1929 final, in which he became the first player to fail from the penalty spot in the event's history), two Glasgow Cups and four Charity Cups. He retired from playing in 1935.
Craig won eight Scotland caps between 1927 and 1930. He also represented the Scottish Football League XI.
Managerial career
After his retirement he went on to manage both Falkirk from 1935 to 1950 and Linfield for a season.

One human poll made up the 2008 National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) football rankings, sometimes called the NAIA Coaches' Poll or the football ratings. Once the regular season was complete, the NAIA sponsored a 16-team playoff to determine the year's national champion. A final poll was then taken after completion of the 2008 NAIA Football National Championship.

Week by week poll
Leading vote-getters
Since the inception of the Coaches' Poll in 1999, the #1 ranking in the various weekly polls has been held by only a select group of teams. Through the postseason poll of the 2008 season, the teams and the number of times they have held the #1 weekly ranking are shown below. The number of times a team has been ranked #1 in the postseason poll (the national champion) is shown in parentheses.
In 1999, the results of a postseason poll, if one was conducted, are not known. Therefore, an additional poll has been presumed, and the #1 postseason ranking has been credited to the postseason tournament champion, the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers.

"" ("Jesus Christ, son of life") is a Christian hymn of the genre Neues Geistliches Lied by Eugen Eckert, with a melody by Peter Reulein. The song is an extended paraphrase of the Agnus Dei. It is part of hymnals and songbooks.
History
"" was written by the Protestant theologian and minister Eugen Eckert from Frankfurt, who has taken care of students, the football arena, and persons outcast by society.
The song addresses Jesus three times, in three stanzas ending in a refrain "" (You, Lamb of God), which in a paraphrase of the Agnus Dei prays for mercy in two stanzas, and finally for peace. It can be used as song for Agnus Dei in the mass.
The melody was composed by Peter Reulein, the church musician at Liebfrauen, Frankfurt. The melody is in D major, and renders the many calls to Jesus in short phrases of a narrow tonal range. Intentionally simple, it flows mostly in eighth notes, with only few syllables as broader quarters. Thus, the beginning of the refrain stands out by four consecutive quarters.
The song is part of regional sections of the German common Catholic hymnal Gotteslob of 2013, for example in the Diocese of Limburg as GL 739. It is part of other hymnals and songbooks.

[[Image:Kutuzov fili.jpg|thumb|250px|Aleksey Kivshenko. The Fili council of war decides to abandon Moscow to Napoleon.]]
A council of war is a term in military science that describes a meeting held to decide on a course of action, usually in the midst of a battle. Under normal circumstances, decisions are made by a commanding officer, optionally communicated and coordinated by staff officers, and then implemented by subordinate officers. Councils of war are typically held when matters of great importance must be decided, consensus must be reached with subordinates, or when the commanding officer is unsure of his position. The classic council of war includes a discussion and then a vote, often taken without the senior commander present to influence or intimidate the subordinates. The tradition in such meetings is that the officers vote in reverse sequence of their seniority, with the junior officers voting first.
In civilian usage, council of war'' can describe any important meeting, such as in business, that must reach a decision under the pressure of adverse conditions.
A variation on the traditional council of war is one in which the subordinates vote, but the results are considered merely advisory to the overall commander, who then makes a final decision. Such a meeting was held on July 2, 1863, during the Battle of Gettysburg, in which Major General George G. Meade, commanding the Union Army of the Potomac, convened his Corps commanders and staff to discuss whether they should withdraw from the battlefield or, if not, whether they should attack Robert E. Lee's Confederate army or await his attack. Historical evidence indicates that Meade had already determined to stay and await Lee's attack, which occurred on July 3, the disastrous attack known as Pickett's Charge. But Meade formed consensus in his staff and improved their confidence by encouraging a two-hour discussion and vote, which resulted in the outcome he was seeking.

Chagnoald (Cagnoald, Cagnou) (died 633 AD) was a Frankish bishop of Laon during the 7th century. The family to which Chagnoald belonged is known as the Faronids, named after his brother Saint Faro, who was bishop of Meaux, while his sister was Saint Burgundofara, who founded the convent of Faremoûtiers. They were the children of the chancellor to Dagobert I, Chagneric.
History
The Faronids were originally from Burgundy, but had settled near Meaux. Chagnoald became a monk at Luxeuil. Columban's biographer, Jonas, recounts how "Columban once withdrew to the forest in order to fast and pray. The food ran out and all he and the young monk Chagnoald had to eat were crab apples. However, when Chagnoald went to collect the apples he found a hungry bear eating them. He returned to Columban for directions. Columban ordered him to go back to the orchard and to divide it in two halves, one for the bear and one for the monks."
When Eustace of Luxeuil went to visit Chlothar II, he left Chagnoald in charge at Luxeuil. Eustace also assigned Waldebert and Chagnoald to instruct the nuns at Burgundofara's double monastery at Faremoutiers in the rule Waldebert drafted for them.
Chagnoald was later ordained bishop of Laon. In that position, he once angered the king, Theuderic II, by criticizing him for his immoral conduct. In response Theuderic exiled Chagnoald from his territories in 610. Chagnoald left his see, finding refuge in the territory of the king's brother Theudebert II, and worked with Columbanus as a missionary in the area of Lake Constance. Columbanus later chastised Chagnoald for suggesting they should pray for the victory of Theudebert, rather than for their enemies.
Theuderic later gained control of this territory as well. Columbanus was banished, and left for Rome, with Chagnoald accompanying him. On the death of Columbanus, Chagnoald returned to his old diocese, and resumed his duties as bishop. He participated in the Council of Reims in 630.
He is venerated as a saint, with a feast day of September 6.

A bairro () is a Portuguese word for a quarter or a neighborhood or, sometimes, a district which is within a city or town. It is commonly used in Portugal, Brazil, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, and other Portuguese-speaking places. Bairro is cognate with Germanic berg, burg, borg, burgh, borough etc., and Spanish barrio, all of which descend from the same Proto-Indo European root.
In Brazil, the word is frequently applied to urban areas in cities, in which the bairros are generally defined only unofficially and have rough borders, without any official administrative function. In some cities, however, the bairros have defined territorial limits set by the municipal government, but most follow popular definition by its citizens.
In Portugal, the word is used with the same meaning as in Brazil, defining a non administrative urban area, frequently without clear borders, an example being the Bairro Alto in Lisbon. Occasionally, a Portuguese bairro can coincide with an administrative freguesia (civil parish). In the past, the cities of Lisbon and Porto were divided in large administrative divisions - each encompassing several freguesias - which were also named bairros.
In Mozambique, bairros are administrative subdivisions of urban districts with important functions in the identification of the residents and determine the attributes of the area in regard to construction or agriculture, much like zoning. They are directed by secretários.
In Guinea-Bissau, bairros are first the peri-urban quarters of the capital Bissau beyond the old city centre (Praça), e.g. Bairro de Ajuda, Bairro Militar, Pessak, Quelele, Luanda, Mpantcha, and by extension quarters of smaller towns throughout the country.

Georges "Jo" Querelle () is the protagonist and antihero of Jean Genet's 1947 novel Querelle de Brest.
Character overview
A sailor on the cargo ship Le Vengeur, Querelle is also a thief, prostitute, opium smuggler, and serial killer. While he ostensibly kills for money, his primary motive for murder is the sheer, liberating pleasure he experiences from it; he kills to feel alive.
Sexuality
While most of Querelle's sexual partners are men, he is more aroused by power than by people. Genet writes that Querelle views sex as an act of either domination or submission, and so treats his partners as objects that exist for the sole purpose of enacting his sadomasochistic fantasies of power and punishment. He has at least a passing interest in women; in one of the novel's main conflicts, he competes with his brother Robert for Madame Lysiane, Robert's mistress and the proprietess of a brothel they both visit. Even then, however, Querelle's pursuit of her is completely self-serving, a ploy to get the best of his brother.
His mysterious, brooding persona and sexual ambiguity make him an object of fascination and attraction to everyone in his orbit, especially Madame Lysiane and Lieutenant Seblon, his closeted superior officer. While not completely understanding who or what he is, the people in his life find themselves inescapably drawn to him, often at their own peril.
In the novel
He runs his smuggling racket out of Le Vengeur, enlisting Vic, one of his shipmates, as his accomplice. One night, when the ship is docked in the French port town of Brest, Querelle slits Vic's throat. The ship is delayed at the port as the police investigate, led by Mario, a predatory police captain who extorts sexual favors from the men he investigates before putting them in jail.
Desperate for a scapegoat, Querelle befriends Gilbert "Gil" Turko, a young man fleeing arrest for the murder of a man who propositioned him, with the intention of framing him for Vic's murder. Much to his surprise, however, he finds in Gil a kindred spirit whom he wants to "teach," both in sex and in the "art" of murder. He enlists Gil to help in mugging Seblon, confident that the lieutenant's infatuation with him will prevent him from going to the police.
Querelle sleeps with Mario in an attempt to get him to back away from arresting him or Gil, but the captain is unmoved from turning him into yet another of his jailed conquests. Seeing no alternative, Querelle betrays Gil to Mario, adding to Gil's already dire situation the blame for a murder he didn't commit.
At the end of the novel, Querelle seduces Seblon, only to turn him over to the police the next day. He leaves Brest the same day when Le Vengeur sets sail.
Portrayals in other media
Querelle was portrayed by Brad Davis in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1982 film adaptation of the novel.

Taribavirin (rINN; also known as viramidine, codenamed ICN 3142) is an antiviral drug in Phase III human trials, but not yet approved for pharmaceutical use. It is a prodrug of ribavirin, active against a number of DNA and RNA viruses. Taribavirin has better liver-targeting than ribavirin, and has a shorter life in the body due to less penetration and storage in red blood cells. It is expected eventually to be the drug of choice for viral hepatitis syndromes in which ribavirin is active. These include hepatitis C and perhaps also hepatitis B and yellow fever.
Uses
Taribavirin is as active against influenza as ribavirin in animal models, with slightly less toxicity, so it may also eventually replace ribavirin as an anti-influenza agent.
History
Taribavirin was first reported in 1973 by J. T. Witkowski et al., then working at ICN Pharmaceuticals, in an attempt to find a more active derivative of ribavirin. Taribavirin is being developed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Valeant is testing the drug as a treatment for chronic hepatitis C.
Pharmacology
Note on formulas: The carboxamidine group of this molecule is somewhat basic, and therefore this drug is also known and administered as the hydrochloride salt (with a corresponding HCl chemical formula and different ChemID / PubChem number). At physiologic pH, the positive charge on the molecule from partial protonation of the carboximide group contributes to the relative slowness with which the drug crosses cell membranes (such as in red blood cells) until it has been metabolized into ribavirin. In the liver, however, the transformation from carboxamidine to carboxamide happens on first-pass metabolism and contributes to the higher levels of ribavirin found in liver cells and bile when viramidine is administered.

Camp Barry was a temporary artillery military camp near Washington, D.C., United States, during the Civil War.
Location
It was located on the "Corcoran Farm located on H Street NE near the Bladingsburg Tollgate".
William W. Corcoran owned several sections of land around the Tollgate as seen on maps at the time. These included:
"Trinidad" (now Trinidad, Washington, D.C.)
"Long Meadow" (later part of Graceland Cemetery and now part of the Carver Langston neighborhood)
"Mount Hamilton" further north on the Bladingsburg Turnpike.
While the exact location is not known, all the descriptions of the camp mention the Bladingsburg tollgate as being close by. It is generally believed that it was located on "Long Meadow".
History
It was established as a artillery camp for the instruction of all volunteer batteries, drills and discipline preparation for service in the field as well as an artillery depot. Originally setup with Sibley tents, wooden barracks were built in the winter of 1862-1863.
The following troops barracked at the camp:
Battery H, 1st Rhode Island Light Artillery from October 28, 1862, to January 19, 1863. It replaced the James rifled guns they had received in Rhode Island with three-inch ordnance guns there. They were the first to move in the wooden barracks on January 1, 1863
12th Independent Battery, Ohio Light Artillery (Union Ohio Volunteers) from June 1863 to September 1863.
7th Battery Light Artillery (“G”) (Union Maine volunteers) from the time they left the State of Maine on February 1, 1864, to April 25, 1864
3rd Battery Light Artillery (“C”) (Union Maine volunteers) from March 25, 1864, to July 5, 1864.
2nd Battery Light Artillery (“B”) (Union Maine volunteers) from November 5, 1863, to April 25, 1864.
10th Independent Battery, New York Light Artillery (Union New York Volunteers) July 1863 to June 1864.
1st Battalion, Maine Light Artillery (Union Maine Volunteers) from April 20, 1864, to July 30, 1864.
16th Independent Battery, Massachusetts Light Artillery from July, 1864 to November 1864.
On April 3, 1865, Richmond, Virginia, is captured by the Union Army. The Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, received a telegraph informing him of the news. The news spreads all over Washington, D.C., and Battery H of the 14th Pennsylvania Artillery started firing one hundred guns at the camp.
On Wednesday, May 17, 1865, during the Trial of the Murderer of President Lincoln, the Camp is mentioned by Lieutenant John J. Taffey, a prosecution witness when cross-examined by Mr. Doster.

John Angell James (6 June 1785 – 1 October 1859), was an English Nonconformist clergyman and writer.
Life
James was born at Blandford Forum. After seven years' apprenticeship to a linen-draper in Poole, Dorset, he decided to become a preacher, and in 1802 he went to David Bogue's training institution at Gosport in Hampshire. A year and a half later, on a visit to Birmingham, his preaching was so highly esteemed by the congregation of Carrs Lane Independent chapel that they invited him to exercise his ministry amongst them; he settled there in 1805, and was ordained in May 1806. For several years his success as a preacher was comparatively small; but he became suddenly popular in about 1814, and began to attract large crowds. At the same time his religious writings, the best known of which are The Anxious Inquirer and An Earnest Ministry, acquired a wide circulation. The Anxious Inquirer sold over 500,000 copies in his lifetime and was translated into more than a dozen languages. This was the book which D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones gave to his wife, Bethan, when she was seeking the Lord. The book was also of great help to Charles Haddon Spurgeon.
In his autobiography Spurgeon wrote: "In an early part of my ministry, while but a lad, I was seized with an intense desire to hear Mr. John Angell James; and, though my finances were somewhat meagre, I performed a pilgrimage to Birmingham solely with that object in view. I heard him deliver a week-evening lecture, in his large vestry, on that precious text, "Ye are complete in Him." The savour of that very sweet discourse abides with me to this day, and I shall never read the passage without associating therewith the quiet but earnest utterances of that eminent man of God."
James was a typical Congregational preacher of the early 19th century, massive and elaborate rather than original. His doctrine was a moderate form of Calvinism, as had been that of Edward Williams, one of his predecessors. He published numerous books on practical subjects of the Christian life, including: The Anxious Inquirer, Pastoral Addresses, an Earnest Ministry, A Help to Domestic Happiness, Female Piety, The Christian Father's Present to His Children, The Young Man's Friend and Guide, and The Widow Directed to the Widow's God. Many of these are still available in print and widely used among Conservative and Reformed Christians in the USA (In England he is largely forgotten). He was one of the founders of the Evangelical Alliance and of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. Municipal interests appealed strongly to him, and he was also for many years chairman of Spring Hill College, Birmingham. He was also an ardent slavery abolitionist, and is portrayed in the huge canvass depicting Thomas Clarkson's opening address at the world's first Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840, in the National Portrait Gallery, London. He was a contemporary of William Wilberforce and Charles Simeon.
John Angell James was keenly involved in all missionary endeavours and a supporter of the London Missionary Society. His name frequently appears in the Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle. In 1817 it was James who handed Bibles to John Williams (of Erromanga) and Robert Moffat, in the commissioning service which sent them off to their fields of labour. His fellow student at Bogue's Academy, Robert Morrison, gave him a lifelong interest in missionary endeavours in China and he was the main instigator of an effort to send a million New Testaments to China. In the event they raised enough money for two million copies.
In August 1859, at the ceremony for the laying of the foundation stone of The Metropolitan Tabernacle, Charles Haddon Spurgeon said, "Especially must I mention the name of that honoured father of all the Dissenting churches, the Rev. John Angell James, of Birmingham. There is no name I think just now that ought to be more venerated than his. We frequently exchange notes. I had a sweet letter from that eminent servant of God, in reply to one I had written asking him to come to this meeting. He said, 'I would have done so if I had been well enough, but I am unable to travel. My work is almost done, I cannot serve my Master much longer, but I can still do a little for Him. I preach perhaps once on the Sabbath, and I still continue to do what I can with my pen. What a mercy,' he adds 'to have been permitted to serve my Master so long.' I had written to him sometime before expressing my candid opinion concerning him, and my hearty respect; and he told me that I was mistaken in him. I am quite sure that I was not. I know that I could not think too highly of him." John Angell James died less than two months later, at his home in Birmingham, on 1 October 1859. By special permission of the Home Secretary he was permitted to be interred in a vault beneath his pulpit in Carr's Lane Chapel, as had long been his wish. On 15 June 1970, when Carrs Lane Church was being rebuilt, the coffins of John Angell James and his second wife were disinterred and reburied at Witton Cemetery, Birmingham, in an unmarked common grave (Grave No. 147, Section 15).
John Angell James's brother, Thomas (1789-1873), also became a pastor, based in London. His brother James was a deacon at Carrs Lane Chapel. His sister Harriet married Rev. Richard Keynes who became pastor of the Congregational church in Salisbury Street, Blandford Forum, where John Angell James had attended as a child.

Family
James married (1) Frances Charlotte Smith on 7 Jul. 1806. Frances, a physician's daughter of independent fortune, resided in Hagley Road, Birmingham, in a house which was to become John Angell James's home for the rest of his life. They had four children:
Stillborn (1807)
Thomas Smith James (1809-1874)
Daughter (1810-1811)
Sarah Ann James (1814-1882)
Frances (b.1783) died 27 Jan. 1819. John Angell James married (2) Anna Maria Neale on 19 Feb. 1822. Anna was the widow of Benjamin Neale (whom she had married in 1812). She had no children.
Thomas Smith James (1809–1874) was a solicitor in Birmingham. He edited his father's works (Published in 17 volumes, 1860–4, by Hamilton Adams) in which he also defended his father's view of justification against criticisms made by his co-pastor and successor, R.W.Dale, who published The Life and Letters of John Angell James in 1861. (See Volume XVII of The Works of John Angell James, containing the Autobiography of John Angell James with additions by his son). Thomas Smith James also published The History of the Litigation and Legislation respecting Presbyterian Chapels and Charities in England and Ireland &c., 1867. Part of this work was earlier issued as Lists and Classifications of Presbyterian and Independent Ministers, 1717–31, &c., 1866, an 'Addendum' [1868] dealt with the criticisms of John Gordon. The work was inaccurate; it did contain "Dr. Evans's List" (1715–1729). His first wife died within weeks of marriage. He married a second time and had two daughters. He died on 3 February 1874.

Norris James Coleman (born September 27, 1961) is an American retired professional basketball player who was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers in the second round (38th pick overall) of the 1987 NBA draft. A 6'8" forward from Kansas State University, Coleman played in only one National Basketball Association (NBA) season.
Coleman played for the Clippers during the 1987–88 season, appearing in 29 games and scoring a total of 153 points. Following his one season in the NBA, Coleman had a lengthy and successful career in foreign professional basketball leagues, principally in Israel. He played with Hapoel Jerusalem during the 1992–93, 1993–94, and 1995–96 seasons, and with Maccabi Tel Aviv during the 1994–95 season. He was the 1994 Israeli Basketball Premier League MVP. Coleman continued to play in Israel in numerous teams until his retirement in 2001, with Hapoel Tel Aviv in the second league, at the age of 40.
College career
Coleman had an unusual collegiate career at Kansas State. Because he had spent five years in the U.S. Army, Coleman was a 24-year-old freshman when he began play at K-State in the 1985–86 basketball season. That season, Coleman led the Big Eight Conference in scoring with 21.8 points per game and pulled down 8 rebounds a game, on the way to being named first-team All-Conference and Newcomer of the Year. In doing so, he became one of the few players to lead his league in scoring during his first season in college. However, near the close of that season, the NCAA found that Coleman had not met the minimum high school requirements and K-State immediately declared him ineligible.
The saga took another twist in April 1986, when the NCAA issued an unusual ruling that said Coleman would have to sit out a year at K-State with no scholarship and surrender a year of eligibility, or transfer to a different school and face no penalties. Coleman immediately received scholarship offers from 25 schools, and took recruiting trips to LSU, the University of Kentucky and the University of Virginia, but eventually decided to stay at Kansas State. Early in the following basketball season, in November 1986, the NCAA reduced its penalty to a 12-game suspension, and Coleman returned to the court for the last 19 games of the 1986–1987 season, teaming with Mitch Richmond to help lead K-State to a berth in the 1987 NCAA tournament. After averaging 20.7 points per game and 8.4 rebounds per game and again being named first team All-Conference in his shortened sophomore season, Coleman decided to turn pro.
Because of his career in the Army, Coleman was affectionately nicknamed "The Sarge" by Kansas State fans.

The Battle of Lahrawat was fought between two factions of the Delhi Sultanate in 1320. Malik Tughluq, the governor of Dipalpur, challenged the authority of Khusrau Khan, who had usurped the throne of Delhi. After defeating an army sent by Khusrau Khan at the Battle of Saraswati, Tughluq marched towards Delhi, and encamped at a plain called Lahrawat.
Khusrau Khan led an army against him, and inflicted severe losses on his camp. When Tughluq was left with around 500 soldiers, Khusrau Khan's soldiers turned their focus towards plundering the enemy baggage, believing they had won the battle. Taking advantage of this, Tughluq launched a direct attack on Khusrau Khan, forcing him to flee the battlefield. Subsequently, the rest of Khusrau Khan's army either fled or was defeated by Tughluq's force.
Background
Khusrau Khan and Malik Tughluq served Sultan Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah, the ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. Khusrau Khan was a slave-general and lover of the Sultan, while Tughluq was a noble who served as the governor of Dipalpur province. In 1320, Khusrau Khan killed Mubarak Shah, and usurped the throne at Delhi. Tughluq opposed Khusrau Khan, and defeated an army sent by him at the Battle of Saraswati. Tughluq then captured Hansi, and marched towards Delhi via Madina, Mandauti, and Palam.
Khusrau Khan initially considered negotiating peace with Tughuq by surrendering him the territory to the east of Palam. However, Khusrau Khan's counselors rejected the idea arguing that his image as a king would be hurt if he did not put up a fight, and Tughluq would reject the offer anyway. They suggested distributing money from the state treasury to ensure that the officers and soldiers remained loyal to Khusrau Khan. Amir Khusrau's Tughluq Nama, written under Tughluq's patronage, states that tens of millions of tankas (coins) were distributed among various nobles and officers, with Hindus getting double of what Muslims got (Khusrau Khan was of Hindu origin). Khusrau adds that this act ruined Khusrau Khan's prestige, and those who received the money felt no obligation to be loyal to him. Ziauddin Barani states that Khusrau Khan's administration gave every soldier two and a half years' salary apart from special grants (inams), and burned all records of expenditure.
The armies
Both armies included Hindu and Muslim soldiers. According to the Tughluq Nama, Khusrau Khan's army was half-Hindu and half-Muslim; this composition surprised both Hindu and Muslim soldiers, but they were friendly towards each other. The army was organized as follows:
Right wing, led by:
Yusuf Sufi Khan
Kamaluddin Sufi
Shaista Khan, son of Qirrat Qamar
Kafur Muhrdar
Shihab naib-i-barbek
Qaisar khas hijab
Ambar Bughra Khan
Tigin, governor of Awadh
Bahauddin Dabir
Left wing, led by:
Baradus (the social group from which Khusrau Khan came), commanded by Randhol Rai Rayan, Nag, Kajb Brahma, and Maldeva
Sumbul Hatim Khan, amir-i hajib
officers of all the diwans, including the minister of war
Talbagha yaghda
Khusrau Khan's army included 10,000 Baradu horsemen stationed around the elephants.
According to Isami, Tughluq's army included:
Central wing, led by Tughluq
Vanguard, led by the Khokhar chief Gul Chandra
A contingent stationed behind Tughluq, led by:
Ali Haidar
Sahij Rai, a Khokhar chief
Left wing, led by:
Bahauddin (son of Tughluq's sister)
Bahram Aiba, the governor of Uchch
Yusuf shuhna-i pil
Nurmand, an Afghan chief
Kari, a Mongol convert to Islam
Asaduddin, son of Tughluq's brother
The battle
On his way to Delhi, Tughluq encamped at Lahrawat, a plain to the west of the Yamuna River, and to the north of Siri. Khusrau Khan's army encamped in front of Hauz-i-Khas (then known as Hauz-i-Alai). On the night before the battle, his soldiers dug a small ditch in front of his camp, and built a mud wall behind it. During the night, one of his important officers - Ainul Mulk - fled to Ujjain-Dhar area in central India, although he became aware of this only in the morning.
Tughluq wanted to delay the battle to better prepare for the fight. However, on a Friday morning, Khusrau Khan launched an attack on Tughluq's camp, forcing him to engage in a battle. According to the chroniclers Barani and Isami, Khusrau Khan's army dominated the early part of the battle, and only 300 soldiers in Tughluq's wing survived the attack. The Baradus, led by Randhol and Kajb Brahma, attacked the contingent commanded by Tughluq's son Malik Jauna. Jauna's contingent moved from its position, allowing the Baradus to pass through towards Tughluq. Tughluq's brother Asaduddin moved from left to the centre to support Tughluq, but Bughra Khan and Talbagha led their units against him.
As Tughluq's units left their positions, Khusrau Khan ordered his general Shaista Khan to attack the baggage of Tughluq's army. Shaista Khan advanced to Tughluq's pavilion, cut its ropes, and announced that Tughluq had retreated. Khusrau Khan's soldiers then turned their focus towards plundering the enemy baggage. Taking advantage of this, Tughluq - whose army had only 500 soldiers left by this time - made a plan to kill Khusrau Khan. He attacked Khusrau Khan from the front, and ordered Gul Chandra to attack him from the rear. Khusrau Khan panicked and fled the battlefield to save his life. This caused a disarray in his army, and most of his soldiers also fled the battlefield. Gul Chandra killed the person bearing the royal canopy (chatr) of Khusrau Khan, and placed the canopy over Tughluq's head.
A part of Khusrau Khan's army, which included several elephants and was dominated by Hindus, remained in its position. According to Isami, these soldiers were a part of the left wing commanded by Sumbul Hatim Khan. According to Amir Khusrau's Tughluq Nama, these soldiers included units from the right wing, led by Yusuf Sufi Khan and Kafur Muhrdar. Tughluq defeated these remaining units, and thus, won the battle.
Aftermath
According to Isami, Tughluq ordered a massacre of Baradus after his victory. The Baradu social group - to which Khusrau Khan belonged - perished as a result of this order. The Baradus who had not been killed on the battlefield were massacred on the streets of Delhi on the next day. According to Tughluq's courtier Amir Khusrau, Tughluq's officers rarely engaged in plundering, and the Muslim soldiers of his army generally did not mistreat the Muslim soldiers of the defeated army. However, the non-Muslim soldiers of Tughluq's army - including the Khokhars, Afghans, Mongols, and Meos - deprived the defeated soldiers of their possessions. According to Amir Khusrau, the Hindus among the defeated soldiers had no protection, and lost all their money, jewelry, and horses. The Muslims among the defeated soldiers were guaranteed their lives, but even they were vulnerable to plundering.
Tughluq subsequently ascended the throne of Delhi under the regnal name Ghiyath al-Din, with various nobles recognizing his authority. Khusrau Khan was captured and beheaded on his orders.

The World3 model is a system dynamics model for computer simulation of interactions between population, industrial growth, food production and limits in the ecosystems of the earth. It was originally produced and used by a Club of Rome study that produced the model and the book The Limits to Growth (1972). The creators of the model were Dennis Meadows, project manager, and a team of 16 researchers.
The model was documented in the book Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World. It added new features to Jay W. Forrester's World2 model. Since World3 was originally created, it has had minor tweaks to get to the World3/91 model used in the book Beyond the Limits, later improved to get the World3/2000 model distributed by the Institute for Policy and Social Science Research and finally the World3/2004 model used in the book Limits to Growth: the 30 year update.
World3 is one of several global models that have been generated throughout the world (Mesarovic/Pestel Model, Bariloche Model, MOIRA Model, SARU Model, FUGI Model) and is probably
the model that generated the spark for all later models .
Model
The model consisted of several interacting parts. Each of these dealt with a different system of the model. The main systems were
the food system, dealing with agriculture and food production
the industrial system
the population system
the non-renewable resources system
the pollution system
Agricultural system
The simplest useful view of this system is that land and fertilizer are used for farming, and more of either will produce more food. In the context of the model, since land is finite, and industrial output required to produce fertilizer and other agricultural inputs can not keep up with demand, there necessarily will be a food collapse at some point in the future.
Nonrenewable resources system
The nonrenewable resource system starts with the assumption that the total amount of resources available is finite (about 110 times the consumption at 1990s rates for the World3/91 model). These resources can be extracted and then used for various purposes in other systems in the model. An important assumption that was made is that as the nonrenewable resources are extracted, the remaining resources are increasingly difficult to extract, thus diverting more and more industrial output to resource extraction.
Reference run predictions
The Dynamics of Growth in a Finite World provides several different scenarios. The "reference run" is the one that "represent the most likely behavior mode of the system if the process of industrialization in the future proceeds in a way very similar to its progress in the past, and if technologies and value changes that have already been institutionalized continue to evolve." In this scenario, in 2000, the world population reaches six billion, and then goes on to peak at seven billion in 2030. After that population declines because of an increased death rate. In 2015, both industrial output per capita and food per capita peak at US$375 per person (1970s dollars, about $ today) and 500 vegetable-equivalent kilograms/person. Persistent pollution peaks in the year 2035 at 11 times 1970s levels.
Criticism of the model
There has been criticism of the World3 model. Some has come from the model creators themselves, some has come from economists and some has come from other places.
In the book Groping in the Dark: The First Decade of Global Modelling, Donella Meadows (a Limits author) writes: We have great confidence in the basic qualitative assumptions and conclusions about the instability of the current global socioeconomic system and the general kinds of changes that will and will not lead to stability. We have relatively great confidence in the feedback-loop structure of the model, with some exceptions which I list below. We have a mixed degree of confidence in the numerical parameters of the model; some are well-known physical or biological constants that are unlikely to change, some are statistically derived social indices quite likely to change, and some are pure guesses that are perhaps only of the right order of magnitude. The structural assumptions in World3 that I consider most dubious and also sensitive enough to be of concern are:
the constant capital-output ratio (which assumes no diminishing returns to capital)
the residual nature of the investment function
the generally ineffective labour contribution to output
A detailed criticism of the model is in the book Models of Doom: A Critique of the Limits to Growth.
Czech-Canadian scientist and policy analyst Vaclav Smil disagreed with the combination of physically different processes into simplified equations:
He does however consider continuous growth in world GDP a problem:
Others have put forth criticisms, such as Henshaw, King, and Zarnikau who in a 2011 paper, Systems Energy Assessment point out that the methodology of such models may be valid empirically as a world model, but might not then also be useful for decision making. The impact data being used is generally collected according to where the impacts are recorded as occurring, following standard I/O material processes accounting methods. It is not reorganized according to who pays for or profits from the impacts, so who is actually responsible for economic impacts is never determined. In their view
The economic motives causing the impacts, that might also control them, would then not be reflected in the model.
As a seeming technicality, it could bring into question the use of many kinds of economic models for sustainability decision-making.
The authors of the book Surviving 1,000 Centuries consider some of the predictions too pessimistic, but some of the overall message correct.
At least one study disagrees with the criticism. Writing in the journal Global Environmental Change, Turner notes that "30 years of historical data compare favorably with key features of the 'business-as-usual' scenario called the 'standard run' produced by the World3 model".
Validation
A number of researchers have attempted to test the predictions of the World3 model against observed data, with varying conclusions. One of the more recent of these, published in Yale's Journal of Industrial Ecology, found that current empirical data is broadly consistent with the 1972 projections, and that if major changes to the consumption of resources are not undertaken, economic growth will peak and then rapidly decline by around 2040.

John Ehret (born in 1971 in Karlsruhe) is the mayor of Mauer, elected in 2012. He is the "first 'black' elected mayor in Germany in modern times", and "Baden-Württembergs erster schwarzer Bürgermeister" ("Baden-Württemberg's first black mayor"). Prior to his position as mayor, Ehret was working at the Bundeskriminalamt as law enforcement official.
Early life
Ehret's father is an Afro-American soldier who was stationed in Germany, and his birth mother was a German. Ehret has little knowledge of his biological father. His mother gave him up for adoption when he was two years old, after she was diagnosed with a brain tumour. In 1977, aged six, he was adopted by Gertrud and Helmut Ehret who moved to Mauer. After graduating from high school in 1992, he obtained a diploma to be a police officer at the Bundeskriminalamt, and subsequently worked in Wiesbaden, Berlin and Meckenheim. He has helped developing countries with the construction of police departments, and in 2012, received an award for his role in helping develop the Afghan police.

William Hambly Stoneman III (born April 7, 1944) is an American former professional baseball player and executive who, during his eight-year (–) pitching career in Major League Baseball, threw two no-hitters; then, as general manager of the Anaheim Angels (–), presided over the franchise's first-ever World Series championship in 2002. He later served briefly as the Angels' interim general manager from July 1 to October 4 of .
Stoneman was born in Oak Park, Illinois, and graduated from West Covina High School in Southern California in 1962.
Amateur career
A right-handed pitcher, Stoneman spent a year at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, then transferred to the University of Idaho to play college baseball for the Idaho Vandals, and helped the Vandals win the inaugural Big Sky title in 1964 as a sophomore. When Stoneman was a junior, the Vandals were 17–13 and he was 5–3 with a 1.80 earned run average (ERA) and averaged 1.5 strikeouts per inning.
As a senior in 1966, Stoneman was 6–2 with a 0.45 ERA in the regular season, and the Vandals won the Big Sky again with a record in the regular season. Invited to the NCAA playoffs for the first time, Idaho eliminated Colorado State College (now Northern Colorado) and Air Force on the road in Greeley, Colorado. The Vandals were one step from the College World Series in Omaha, but lost to Arizona in Tucson in the District 7 finals, today's "Super-Regionals" (Sweet 16). Idaho ended their best-ever season at
Stoneman received his bachelor's degree from the University of Idaho in 1966, and a master's degree from the University of Oklahoma. While at Idaho, he was an active member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity.
Professional career
The Chicago Cubs selected Stoneman in the 31st round of the 1966 Major League Baseball draft with the 595th overall selection. After signing, Stoneman pitched at three minor-league classifications in 1966, with Rookie-level Caldwell, Single-A Lodi, and Double-A Dallas-Fort Worth. He started 1967 in Double-A and, after five games pitched, moved to Triple-A Tacoma.
The Cubs called up Stoneman to the major leagues in mid-season of 1967. He debuted as a starting pitcher with back-to-back assignments against the San Francisco Giants on July 16 and 21, allowing three total runs in 9 innings but gaining no decisions, although the Cubs won both games. Manager Leo Durocher then shifted Stoneman to the bullpen, where he made 26 appearances as a relief pitcher. He ended his rookie MLB campaign with a 3.29 earned run average, four saves and 52 strikeouts in 63 innings pitched. But he was less effective in , with his ERA climbing to 5.52 in only 29 innings of work, and spent part of the season back at Triple-A Tacoma.
In the expansion draft of October 1968, Stoneman was selected by the Montreal Expos, where he spent five seasons and became a full-time starter for manager Gene Mauch. He threw his two no-hitters with the Expos: the first against the Philadelphia Phillies at Connie Mack Stadium on April 17, 1969. It was Stoneman's fifth major league start and only the ninth game of the franchise's existence; he had eight strikeouts and five walks. The second came at the end of the 1972 season on October 2, when he defeated the New York Mets in Montreal at Jarry Park, caught by Tim McCarver. The latter was the first major league no-hitter in Canada, and both were 7–0 scores. The second included nine strikeouts and seven walks. Stoneman also threw a one-hitter at home in 1971 against the San Diego Padres, a well-attended 2–0 win on Helmet Night on Wednesday, June 16. In perhaps the best outing of his career, Stoneman struck out 14 and allowed just one base on balls. The only hit came with one out in the seventh inning, a clean single to right field off the bat of Cito Gaston, which was the Padres' only well-struck ball of the night. He was named to the National League All-Star Team in 1972
and pitched two innings in relief with two strikeouts.
At tall and , Stoneman was a workhorse who over four consecutive seasons (–) logged more than 200 innings pitched. He struck out 251 in 295 innings in 1971, with a 17–16 record and a 3.15 ERA for non-contending Montreal(71–90 ()). That season, Stoneman also finished third in strikeouts in the National League, behind Tom Seaver (289) and Ferguson Jenkins (263), and his 39 starts tied for the league-high with Jenkins. He also had 20 complete games in 1971, tied for third with Bob Gibson. His career was shortened by an arm injury in 1973: his earned run average ballooned from 2.98 in 1972 to 6.80 (1973), then 6.10 (1974), for a record of only 5–16 in that span.
Overall, Stoneman won 54 games and lost 85 (), with an ERA of 4.08 in 245 appearances. For his career he had 169 starts, 45 complete games, and 934 strikeouts in 1,236 innings.
As a batter, Stoneman holds the record with most consecutive games played with at least one strikeout. From April 30, 1971, to April 21, 1972, Stoneman played in 37 consecutive games with at least one strikeout in an at bat. He was left in to bat in the 1972 All-Star Game against Gaylord Perry, where, he struck out in the bottom of the seventh inning. In 338 regular season at bats, Stoneman struck out 212 times and compiled a career batting average of .086 with 25 singles, 4 extra-base hits (all doubles), and 23 walks. Despite that strikeout streak, his best season batting average was .129 in 1971. The strikeout streak record was tied by New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge in 2017.
Front office career
After his playing career ended, Stoneman worked in banking in Canada, then joined the Montreal Expos' front office in November 1983, starting out in player relations. He became the team's vice president of business operations in September 1984, and later served as the club's general manager in 1987 and 1988.
Returning to Southern California, Stoneman became general manager of the Angels after the season. He hired Mike Scioscia as the club's manager and presided over its American League title and World Series championship — the first pennant and World Series championship in the club's 42-year history to that point. He remained in office through the Angels' ownership transition from the Walt Disney Company to Arturo Moreno. During his tenure, the team also won American League West Division titles in , and . Stoneman stepped down as GM following the 2007 season.
On July 1, 2015, Angels general manager Jerry DiPoto resigned following a power struggle with manager Mike Scioscia. Stoneman was brought in as interim GM while the team looked for a full-time replacement. Billy Eppler was hired as the full-time replacement on October 4, 2015.

Suraiya Hasan Bose (1928 - 2021) was an Indian textile conservator, textile designer, and manufacturer, who worked to preserve traditional Indian textile art and techniques. She worked with the Indian Cottage Industries Emporium, as well as the Indian Handloom and Handicrafts Export Corporation, later establishing her own textile manufacturing unit to create traditional Indian textiles. Her designs have been exhibited in the Victoria and Albert Museum.
Biography
Suraiya Hasan was born in 1928 in Etawah, Uttar Pradesh, and was raised in Hyderabad, Telangana. Her father, Hasan Bose, established a bookstore and a handicraft manufacturing unit in Hyderabad. His handicraft unit focused on manufacturing traditional Indian bidri (metalwork) objects. She studied textile design at Cambridge University. Her uncle was the Indian freedom fighter, Abid Hasan Safrani. She later married Aurobindo Bose, the nephew of Indian freedom fighter Subhash Chandra Bose. Her family were significant participants in the Swadeshi movement, a nationalist movement that focused on producing and using native Indian textiles over imported British cotton during colonial rule in India. She died in 2021, at the age of 93.
Career
After studying textiles at Cambridge University, Hasan Bose joined the Indian Cottage Industries Emporium, a governmental organization dedicated to producing and manufacturing traditional Indian handicrafts. Along with Pupul Jaykar, from the 1950s she managed the Handloom and Handicraft Export Corporation, a public sector undertaking of the Government of India in Delhi, and directed their export unit. During her tenure in Delhi, she collaborated with Indian handloom artists and art conservators such as Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, Martand Singh and Lakshmi Jain to revive traditional Indian handicrafts.
In the 1970s, Hasan Bose moved back to Hyderabad along with her uncle, freedom fighter Abid Hasan Safrani. She established a textile manufacturing unit on land provided by Safrani. Hasan Bose collaborated with Indian artists to revive two traditional textile forms that nearly ceased to exist. These included himru weave, which derives from Persian textiles and is a complicated brocade weave embroidered with silk, created on custom eight-pedal looms, as well as mushroo, a double-layered cotton and silk weave. Bose hired artisans, catalogued traditional and historical designs, and manufactured both, himru and mashru textiles, as well as other traditional textiles and techniques used in the creation of saris and fabrics, such as paithani, telia rumal, ikat, jamawar, and hand-painted kalamkari. Her unit is currently the only manufacturer of himru textile in India.
In addition to manufacturing textiles, Bose built an archive of traditional motifs for textile patterns in India, using these to create new designs and reconstructing heritage jaalas or graphs used to set looms for weaving patterns. Her original designs were exhibited in the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2015, as part of a special exhibit on the fabrics of India. Bose's designs were supplied chiefly to Indian designers, as well as to Fabindia, but also exported Indian textiles. Bose also established a training unit, in order to teach handloom, weaving, and textile art to widows who did not have other options for employment, as well as a school to provide free education to the families of weavers and handloom artists. In 2019, Bose was the subject of a book that recorded her contributions to textile conservation in India.

Laughanstown () is a stop on the Luas light-rail tram system in Dún Laoghaire - Rathdown, south of Dublin, Ireland. It opened in 2010 as a stop on the extension of the Green Line south from Sandyford to Brides Glen. The stop provides access to the nearby suburb of Cabinteely.
History
The stop was intended to serve a new suburb being developed during the Celtic Tiger. A lack of subsequent development in the vicinity resulted in Laughanstown being the least used stop on the Luas Network. As of 2022, the land around the stop is again under development and new roads have been constructed close to the stop.

The Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) is an unpressurized rover being developed by NASA that astronauts can drive on the Moon while wearing their spacesuits. The development of the LTV is a part of NASA's Artemis Program which involves returning astronauts to the Moon, specifically the lunar South Pole, by 2025. The Lunar Terrain Vehicle will be the first lunar rover developed by NASA since the Lunar Roving Vehicle used during the Apollo program.
History
On February 6, 2020, NASA issued a request to seeking industry feedback on relevant state-of-the-art commercial technologies and acquisition strategies for a new Lunar Terrain Vehicle. NASA also stated in the request that they want the new LTV to draw on recent innovations in electric vehicle energy storage and management, autonomous driving, and extreme environment resistance.”
On August 31, NASA released another request to private companies for additional input on approaches and solutions for a vehicle to transport Artemis astronauts around the lunar South Pole. NASA also asked if American companies are interested in providing the LTV as a commercial service, or as a product NASA would purchase and own.
LTV Proposals
Three proposals for a Lunar Terrain Vehicle have been publicly unveiled since NASA's initial request.
On May 26, 2021, Lockheed Martin and General Motors announced they would be teaming up to design a Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) for NASA capable of transporting astronauts across the lunar surface. On April 5, 2022, MDA Ltd. announced they would work with Lockheed Martin and General Motors to integrate MDA's commercial robotic arm technology on their planned human-rated lunar mobility vehicles. On July 20th, 2022, Goodyear announced they would join Lockheed Martin and General Motors and develop tires for the LTV drawing from its advanced airless tire technology.
On November 16, 2021, Northrop Grumman announced they would team up with AVL, Intuitive Machines, Lunar Outpost, and Michelin to design a Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) to transport NASA's Artemis astronauts around the lunar surface.
On April 7, 2022, Teledyne Brown Engineering announced that it would lead a team including Sierra Space and Nissan North America to design a crewed Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) that will support future exploration on the Moon.
Plans
NASA currently plans to launch the Lunar Terrain Vehicle on Artemis 5. The Lunar Terrain Vehicle will be a co-manifested payload on a Space Launch System Block 1B rocket in which the rover will ride on the Exploration Upper Stage right below the Orion spacecraft.

The Museu Tèxtil i d'Indumentària, in English Textile and Clothing Museum, is a museum opened on 1982 and located in the Palau Reial de Pedralbes in Barcelona. The museum possesses countless objects and pieces of major artistic and historical value that make up their collections of garments, fabrics and jewellery. Regarding their collection of clothes, the museum allows you to take a journey through the history of textiles, from the 16th century right up to the modern day. The museum's collections include Coptic, Hispano-Arab, Gothic and Renaissance fabrics, as well as embroidery, a section on lacework and a collection of prints. Also worth mentioning is the jewelry collection, comprising approximately five hundred pieces that were made and produced in Spain.
Together with Museu de les Arts Decoratives and the Gabinet de les Arts Gràfiques is part of the Disseny Hub Barcelona.
Palau Reial de Pedralbes
The palace has its origins in the old Masia (mas or farmer's house) de Can Feliu, from the 17th century. The corresponding land was acquired by the count Eusebi Güell, along with the neighbouring Can Cuiàs de la Riera. Together they formed the Finca
Güell, an extensive parcel of land (30,000 m2). The Can Feliu building was remodeled by the architect Joan Martorell i Montells, who built a Caribbean-style small palace, together with a Gothic-style chapel and surrounded by magnificent gardens. Later the building remodeling was given to Antoni Gaudí, together with the construction of a surrounding perimeter wall and the side entry pavilions.
Gaudí also partially designed the gardens surrounding the palace, placing two fountains and a pergola and planted many Mediterranean plants like palm trees, cypress trees, magnolias, pine trees and eucalyptus. The Font d'Hércules (Hercules fountain) still exists today on site, restored in 1983; it has a bust of Hercules on top of a pillar with Catalonia's shield and a spout in the shape of a Chinese dragon.
In the Palau Reial de Pedralbes (Diagonal, 686) are placed the DHUB Museums, and you can visit the permanent exhibitions of Museu Tèxtil i d'Indumentària and a permanent exhibition of the Museu de les Arts Decoratives. which later will be passed to the building of Glòries.
History
The history of the Museu Tèxtil i d'Indumentària dates back to 1883, when the Barcelona City Council acquired its first collections of textiles with the objective of creating a monographic museum. For the greater part of the 20th century, the collections of fabrics, clothing and lacework were split between various museums.
In 1961, the Museu Tèxtil opened on the premises of the old Hospital de la Santa Creu. In 1968, the doors of the Museu de les Puntes (Lacework Museum) were opened at the Palau de la Virreina and then, in 1969, at the Palau del Marquès de Lió, the Museu d'Indumentària was born, thanks to the generous donation of Manuel Rocamora. It was not until 1982 that the three museums were united to become the Museu Tèxtil i d'Indumentària.
In 1993, the Museu Tèxtil i d'Indumentària opened a new permanent exhibition to showcase its historic collection of fabrics and clothing, and since 2003 has dedicated its exhibitions to proposals concerned with the culture of fashion.
Finally, in 2008, the museum transferred its collections to the Palau de Pedralbes which led to the opportunity to create a new presentation of the collection: The Dressed Body that demonstrates how clothing has modified body image from the 16th century to the present day.
Currently, the Museu Tèxtil i d'Indumentària in Pedralbes share its location with Museu Tèxtil i d'Indumentària and the Gabinet de les Arts Gràfiques, an office of Graphic Arts, with which it forms part of the Disseny Hub Barcelona. These collections are expected to move to a new headquarters being built in the Plaça de les Glòries of Barcelona.
Permanent Exhibits
Dressing the body
Dressing the body proposes a tour of the history of garments, covering five centuries, from 1550 to 2000 – a game of fascinating parallelisms between the morphology of the human body, socio-cultural events and historic styles. Since ancient times, men and women have altered the form and appearance of their body through hairstyles, jewellery, tattoos and, above all, garments. Each period's way of dressing has to do with moral, social and aesthetic codes.
Fashion imposes ideals of beauty. Silhouettes and volumes are altered – nature gives way to artifice. The exhibition, Dressing the body, depicts the transformations the body has undergone, prompted by changes in clothing involving five different actions, which tend to either confine or liberate it.
Dressing the body has been nominated as one of the 116 Touristic Icons of Catalunya, an initiative that identifies the most significant symbols and manifestations that represent the Catalan visual identity. The collection was prepared by the Agència Catalana de Turisme, the Direcció General de Turisme and Artesania Catalunya of CCAM, to Foment de les Arts i el Disseny (FAD), the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC) and the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC).
Temporary exhibits
What to Wear? Maria Brillas' Wardrobe by Pedro Rodríguez
The act of getting dressed is more involved than what it seems at first sight. Disseny Hub Barcelona reflects on self-identity in terms of the question, What to wear? the title of an exhibition comprising some fifty pieces selected from the Maria Brillas endowment, all of them made by Pedro Rodríguez, a great master of 20th-century haute couture. By re-creating the everyday act of standing in front of the wardrobe and deciding on the garments we wish to wear, this display aims to focus on contemporary issues by providing a rare insight into the role of garments in constructing our own identity. It also explores the various factors we consider when creating our image, as well as the autobiographical nature our wardrobe is likely to take on during our lifetime.
The exhibits on display are part of a collection donated by Hilda Bencomo, Maria Brillas' granddaughter, to the Museu Tèxtil i d'Indumentària, which comprises 341 pieces, 183 dresses and 158 accessories. The ensemble re-creates the rich, original world of references which Pedro Rodríguez used to conceptualise his oeuvre, much of which belongs to the mainstream of Spanish fashion design. His brilliant career, spanning Barcelona, Madrid and San Sebastián, ran from 1919 to 1980. The story of Maria Brillas, as told by her dresses, created by Pedro Rodríguez, is part of Barcelona's history and belongs to the cultural heritage of Catalonia and Spain.

St. Martin's Church is an Episcopal church founded in 1699 in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, United States. It is located at 22 Church Street, only 500 feet from the Delaware River. It is one of the earliest and last riverfront churches in Pennsylvania. The cemetery at St. Martin's Church contains a memorial commemorating war veterans from the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, the American Civil War, and the Spanish–American War who are buried in the cemetery.
History
St. Martin's Church was founded in 1699 by Walter Martin of Upper Chichester, Pennsylvania as an alternative place of worship and burial for non-Quakers. Martin was a Quaker, however he became embittered against the "Religious Society of Friends". On December 18, 1699, Martin donated one and half acres of land to the town and inhabitants of Marcus Hook for a church and burial place. In the deed, he included the restriction that "Quakers and reputed Quakers only excepted". The church was originally named the Chapel at Chichester.
In 1702, a rude frame building that was previously used as a blacksmith shop was purchased for 5 pounds, moved to the church property and church services began.
St. Martin's Church was originally part of the parish of St. Paul's in Chester, Pennsylvania along with St. John's Church in Concord, Pennsylvania. In 1704, Reverend Henry Nichols was sent by The Society of the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts to preach in all three churches.
Missionaries were sent from Philadelphia to preach to the congregation, however problems arose due to the distance the preachers had to travel and the church began to have ministers from the Swedish Church in Wilmington, Delaware preside over the congregation.
By 1745 the congregation had outgrown the original, old frame building and funds were raised to build a small brick church approximately 12 feet by 16 feet. The old frame church building remained on the property and was used as the first school in Marcus Hook. The school remained open until 1860 when a new brick schoolhouse was built elsewhere and the old frame church building was demolished.
In 1760, the church name was changed from Chapel at Chichester to St. Martin's in honor of the founder Walter Martin at the suggestion of Emmanuel Grubb, son of John Grubb, a two-term member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly and one of the original settlers of the Brandywine A Hundred which became Claymont, Delaware.
In 1822, St. Martin's Church separated from St. Paul's parish of Chester and became a separate organization.
In 1845, the church was rebuilt with the current building.
In 1967, the parishioners outgrew the church and built a new place of worship at 700 Meetinghouse Road in Boothwyn, Pennsylvania.
In 1979, the church was designated a Local Historic Landmark by the Marcus Hook Borough Council.
In 1985, the church and cemetery were obtained by The Marcus Hook Community Development Corporation and renovated to be historically accurate. The building has been leased out to different church congregations and is currently used by the Bible Presbyterian Church of Marcus Hook.
Cemetery
The cemetery at St. Martin's Church contains about 500 graves dating as far back as the 1700s.
Soldier and Sailor Walk Memorial
At the cemetery's back end is the Soldier and Sailors Walk Memorial commemorating 73 soldiers buried in the cemetery. The memorial was dedicated on May 24, 2003 by the Marcus Hook Community Development Corporation. The memorial consists of a section of headstones commemorating soldiers from five different wars: "the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War and the Spanish–American War". All the soldiers included in the memorial are honorably discharged and fully documented.
At the center of the walk is a white eagle statue and bronze plaque that reads:
"Dedicated to the men buried at St. Martin's Church Cemetery (1699) who served their country in the following wars.Revolutionary War 1775-1783War of 1812 1812-1815Mexican War 1846-1848Civil War 1861-1865Spanish–American War 1898"May your names not just lie on dusty pages in history books and on worn gravestones, but be engraved deep in our hearts for all eternity.''''"

John Grubb (1652–1708), member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly and one of the original settlers of the Brandywine A Hundred that became Claymont, Delaware is buried at St. Martin's Church

The eastern frogfish (Batrachomoeus dubius) is a bottom-dwelling fish endemic to coastal eastern Australia, from Fraser Island, Queensland to Kiama, New South Wales. It is an ambush predator with a large expandable stomach, capable of swallowing crustaceans, molluscs and other fishes whole.
Habitat
The fish is found at depths of 1–150 m along the continental shelf but also estuaries and inshore reefs. Rarely seen in the open, they shelter on rocky reefs and among seaweed or under rocks and in underwater caves.
Morphology
The eastern frogfish has a flattened head with a wide mouth surrounded by a distinct fleshy 'beard'. Its colour varies from mottled brown to pale grey or bluish-grey, with two broad bands and scattered splotches along the body. Juveniles are paler with broad bands. They reach a maximum length of 35 cm.

Dimetapp is an American brand of over-the-counter cold and allergy medicines that is manufactured by Foundation Consumer Brands. At one point, Dimetapp as a household word referred to a single combination preparation marketed to relieve symptoms of the cold, containing brompheniramine (an antihistamine) and phenylephrine (decongestant replacing the formerly used pseudoephedrine, which itself replaced phenylpropanolamine). Variants were created, including Dimetapp DM with the addition of dextromethorphan (an antitussive or cough suppressant). Dimetapp Elixir and Colour Free Elixir are intended to relieve nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy watery eyes and sneezing, whereas Dimetapp DM and Dimetapp DM Colour Free Elixir are intended for colds with dry coughs and also to treat whooping cough. Early Dimetapp was flavored with cherry and plum as they were readily available during the time, setting a precedent for its purple color; however, the flavor has been described as a grape candy.
Like many over-the-counter medications, Dimetapp relies on marketing and branding as differentiators of otherwise similar (often identical) branded and unbranded medications to maintain their premium pricing. Additionally, the actual medications are subject to remarketing in other brands. As an example, "Children's Dimetapp ND" is a 10 mg orally disintegrating loratadine tablet with a "cool blast" flavour additive. The same product with a "Citrus Burst" flavour additive was also manufactured and distributed by Wyeth but branded and marketed as "Alavert" (not "children's").
Dimetapp was acquired by Pfizer in the 2009 acquisition of Wyeth.
Foundation Consumer Brands acquired Dimetapp in September 2020.

Phi Draconis (φ Dra / φ Draconis) is a fourth-magnitude variable star in the constellation Draco. It has the Flamsteed designation 43 Draconis. It is also a triple star system where the brightest component is a chemically peculiar Ap star.
The brightness of φ Draconis varies by about 0.04 of a magnitude every 1.7 days. This is due to very strong magnetic fields at the surface of the star, and it is classified as an α2 Canum Venaticorum variable.
φ Draconis is a multiple star system containing three stars. The inner pair form a single-lined spectroscopic binary in an eccentric 128-day orbit. The outermost star orbits the inner pair every 308 years. The outer pair can be resolved visually and have a semi-major axis of . A fourth component, C, is also listed in multiple star catalogues, but is only a chance alignment with the triple system.
Phi Draconis Aa is a main-sequence Ap star with a spectral class of B8. The main abundance excess is silicon, although iron and chromium and also notably elevated.
In Chinese astronomy, φ Draconis is called 柱史 (Pinyin: Zhùshǐ), meaning Official of Royal Archives, because this star is marking itself and stand alone in Official of Royal Archives asterism, Purple Forbidden enclosure (see: Chinese constellations).

The Armoury Show were a British new wave band, formed in 1983 and consisting of Richard Jobson on vocals, Russell Webb on bass guitar, John McGeoch on guitar and John Doyle on drums.
The band was named after The Armory Show, a famous 1913 modern art exhibition held in New York. They released six singles and one studio album in their brief existence.
History
The band comprised Richard Jobson, Russell Webb, John McGeoch and John Doyle. Each member had previously been in critically acclaimed and commercially successful bands; Jobson and Webb were in The Skids, whilst McGeoch and Doyle had been in post-punk pioneers Magazine.
The Skids had dissolved in 1981 and Magazine in 1982, each following the release of their final albums (Joy and Magic, Murder and the Weather, respectively). John McGeoch had left Magazine in 1980, before the recording of their last album, joining Siouxsie and the Banshees. He also replaced Stuart Adamson for a Peel session recorded by The Skids in 1981.
According to Russell Webb, in the sleeve notes of the 2013 re-issue of their album Waiting for the Floods, the intention was not to be a band, but a collective of musicians getting together to write songs and make music in the studio. McGeoch persuaded his compatriots to take their songs on the road and, following a press showcase at The Venue in London, the band signed to Parlophone and EMI America.
Their debut single, "Castles in Spain", was released in 1984, followed later that year by "We Can Be Brave Again". Given the green light to record an album, the band spent four weeks at Manor Studios in rural Oxfordshire, with producer Nick Launay at the controls. The resultant album, Waiting for the Floods, and accompanying singles "The Glory of Love" and a re-release of "Castles in Spain" came out in 1985.
Richard Jobson spent less and less time with the band. In 1986, following the tour to promote the album, both McGeoch and Doyle left the band, with the former joining Public Image Ltd. and the latter working with former Buzzcocks lead singer/guitarist Pete Shelley.
When Jobson returned from China, where he had been working as model, he reunited with Webb, calling on Dave Lockwood (guitar) and Ray Weston (drums) to record tracks for their next album. The singles "Love in Anger" and "New York City" followed, In 1988, it was announced that the band had split up, with what would have been their second album Monkey Cry promoted as Richard Jobson's solo debut Badman. After a brief solo career Jobson became a television presenter and film director. Webb pursued a solo career before joining McGeoch in Public Image Ltd in 1992, making his live debut at the Reading Festival.
In 2019, it was announced that the band would be resurrected under the amended name The Armory Show with a new line up (Jobson being the only original member), featuring Nickolas Young & Rory Cowieson of Scottish shoegaze band Domiciles and Nick Hernandez of Foreignfox.

Everybodys Mouth's a Book is an album by Henry Threadgill featuring eight of Threadgill's compositions performed by Threadgill & Make a Move. The album was the first album on the Pi Recordings label and was released simultaneously with Up Popped the Two Lips by Threadgill's Zooid in 2001.
Reception
Both of Threadgill's initial Pi releases attracted critical approval. The Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars, stating, "This is deft footwork on the part of Threadgill as a leader, who lets his musicians shine and keeps them focused on the task at hand. Everybody's Mouth's a Book is as solid top to bottom as its companion release on Pi". The All About Jazz review by Glenn Astarita stated, "Henry Threadgill's importance to modern jazz cannot be denied, as there are few composers who possess such a distinguishable methodology to music in general". The Boston Phoenix'''s Ed Hazell
stated, "Everybodys Mouth's a Book'', the Make a Move quintet's second release, feels like a more traditional jazz album: the tempos are faster, and the instrumentation is closer to what you expect from a jazz quintet. But after the band's first album, this one too defies expectation".

One of the potential pitfalls for observers trying to interpret the operation of bikeways (or segregated cycle facilities) is that the same legal assumptions do not apply in all environments. For instance, in contrast to most English speaking countries, some European countries, including Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands have defined liability legislation. Thus there is a legal assumption that motorists are automatically considered liable in law for any injuries that occur if they collide with a cyclist. This may hold regardless of any fault on the part of the cyclist and may significantly affect the behaviour of motorists when they encounter cyclists.
In some countries it is legal for cyclists to pass a motor-vehicle on its kerb-side, and cyclists doing so may enjoy the protection of the law. In this case, the use of segregated cycle facilities conforms to existing traffic law. In other jurisdictions similar "undertaking" manoeuvres by cyclists are illegal. Such distinctions form the basis of the claim by John Forester that segregated cycle facilities encourage behaviours that flout existing traffic law and in which cyclists enjoy no legal protection.
Cyclists in some countries are also given separate rules and light phases at traffic signals and cyclist-specific traffic lights. For instance, in Germany and elsewhere at junctions with segregated facilities all the traffic in a given direction (motorists, pedestrians and cyclists) may get a green signal at the same time. Turning motor traffic is obliged to wait for cyclists and pedestrians to clear the junction before proceeding. In this situation all the transport modes get equal green time. In contrast, UK and Irish practice restricts pedestrians to a dedicated signal phase, separate from and usually much shorter than the green phase for motorists (e.g. 6–12 seconds, vs. signal cycle times of up to 120 seconds). If cyclists were to be segregated and treated in a similar manner this would imply a significant reduction in green time for cycle traffic at every junction. In the English city of Cambridge the use of cyclist-specific traffic signals is reported to have resulted in increased delays for cyclists, leading some to ignore the cycle-facilities and stay on the road. A similar example occurred in a Parisian bikepath scheme in 1999. Cyclists faced twice the number of traffic signals as motorised traffic and were expected to wait over one minute to get seven seconds of green time. Conversely, in Copenhagen cyclist-specific traffic signals on a major arterial bike lane have been linked to provide "green waves" for rush hour cycle-traffic, which time the lights so cyclists going an average speed are much more likely to encounter green lights on their trip.

Legal signifiance of cycle tracks in European countries
Cycle tracks typically exclude all motorized vehicles for most countries. Some exceptions are made, such as in the Netherlands, for light motorbikes. Some jurisdictions require cyclists to use cycle tracks if present (obligatory cycle tracks) or allow cyclists to either use the cycle track or a parallel roadway (facilitative cycle tracks).
In the United Kingdom, cycletracks are defined as cycleways physically separated from the carriageway. Their usage is not obligatory, I. e. cyclists may also ride on the parallel carriageway. They may not ride on the sidewalk, but pedestrians are allowed to walk on the cycletrack, if there is no sidewalk.
In the Netherlands, most major roads have cycletracks and most cycletracks (fietspaden) exclude motorized vehicles and cyclists are required to use them if available. Light motorbikes are allowed and obliged to use some cycle tracks marked as fiets- en bromfietspaden. Non-obligatory cycletracks are rare but where they exist, they are indicated by signs using the word fietspad'' instead of a bicycle logo.
In Belgium, the traffic law does not distinguish roadside cycletracks from cyclelanes on the carriageway. All roadside cycletracks exclude motorized vehicles and cyclists are obliged to use them.
In France, cycletracks and cycle lanes exclude all motorized traffic. Until 1998 cyclists were obligated to use them if present. By law, most cycletracks ought to be facilitative ("conseillée et réservée", reserved and recommended), but most local authorities are delaying the replacement of round panels (obligatory) by rectangular ones (advisory).
In 1997, Germany changed the law that using the road is the standard. Roadside cycletracks can only make obligatory for safety reasons and must have minimum physical standards (width, straightness). The non-obligatory ones have to be visible by design, but no panel sign existed. Since beginning of 2014, there is the possibility to signpost bidirectional non-obligatory roadside cycletracks using additional panels. There are big differences among the local applications of these laws. Extreme cases are the two cities with the highest cycling rates: in Münster, on almost all cycletracks cyclists are obligated to use them if present, in Bremen more than 75% are not. In Bremen, some cycle tracks have been displaced by traffic calming on the carriageway or by cycle lanes. Also Berlin, Cologne, Munich and Hamburg are making campaigns to convert obligatory cycletracks to facilitative ones or to displace them by cycle lanes (especially Hamburg)
In Poland cycle tracks exclude motorized vehicles and can be marked as obligatory or facilitative cycletracks.
In Italy, all cycle tracks exclude motorized vehicles and require cyclists to use them if present.
In Switzerland, all cycle tracks exclude motorized vehicles and require cyclists to use them if present.
In Austria, cycle tracks exclude motorized vehicles and since 2014 have made them optional for cyclists, with rectangular signs to differentiate from the typical round signs. A similar rectangular version was created for combined foot-and-cycleways and for cycleway and adjacent footway.
Austrian cycletrack signs
Strict Liability
A number of European countries, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden, apply a strict liability towards cyclists, protecting them. For example, in the Netherlands, the law assumes the stronger participant (e.g. a car driver) is liable in the case of an accident with a weaker participant (e.g. a cyclist) unless it can be proved that the cyclist's behavior could not have been expected.

Tillergone Slope () is a glacial slope, 1.2 nautical miles (2.2 km) wide, which is a distributary of Flight Deck Neve between Dotson Ridge and Flagship Mountain, in Convoy Range, Victoria Land. The name was applied by a New Zealand Antarctic Research Program (NZARP) field party to commemorate an incident when the steering gear of a motor toboggan broke during the 1989–90 season. At the time, this glacier was being used as access to a camp at Flagship Mountain, and the slope had to be negotiated twice without steerage.

Hridaynath Mangeshkar (Marathi pronunciation: [ɦɾud̪əjnaːt̪ʰ məŋɡeːʃkəɾ]) is an Indian music director. He is the only son of musician Deenanath Mangeshkar and younger brother of Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle. He is popularly known as Balasaheb in the music and film industry.
Career
Hridaynath debuted his music career in 1955 with the Marathi film Akash Ganga. Since then, he has composed for various Marathi films such as Sansar, Chaani, Ha Khel Savalyancha, Janaki, Jait Re Jait, Umbartha and Nivdung and a few Bollywood films; the most notable among them being Subah, Lekin... and Maya Memsaab.
He has been very selective with his work. He has composed songs in Marathi and Hindi. His songs often have complex meters and require singers of great range and depth for enjoyable renditions. His composition of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar's poem Saagara Pran Talamalala is a case in point. His 1982 album Dnyaneshwar Mauli, featuring compositions from Jñāneśvar, one of the most famous poets in Marathi literature, set the standard for modern devotional music in Marathi.
He also composed music for Doordarshan musical drama Phoolwanti.
He has also composed folk songs. Staying true to the spirit, his Koli Geets (fishermen songs) reflect the traditional rhythms of the fishermen of Konkan. His music to the critically acclaimed movie Jait Re Jait is another example of his prowess in this genre. One of his most popular works is the composition for the Marathi film Nivdung.
At one point, Hridaynath was a student of Ustad Amir Khan; however, he feels that his guru is not as timeless as his sister Lata.
He has been the recipient of several awards throughout his career, such as the prestigious National Award at the hands of the President of India, the Lata Mangeshkar Award of Maharashtra state, and seven Maharashtra State Awards for Best Vocalist and Music Director/Composer.
He was awarded the title pandit by the people of Maharashtra at the hands of Bhimsen Joshi and Jasraj. The Shankaracharya has conferred upon him the title Bhaav Gandharva.
He was awarded Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2009.
Some of his most memorable Hindi film scores are Harishchandra Taramati, Prarthana, Chakra, Lekin..., Maya Memsaab, Lal Salaam, Yash Chopra's Mashaal, Dhanwan and Chaani, to name a few.
He is also the first Indian composer to compose and release two entire albums featuring the poems and songs of the poet-saint Meera, titled Chala Vahi Des and Meera Bhajans. He has recently also composed and released an album titled Meera Soor Kabeera, featuring the works of Meera, Kabir and Surdas. He produced an album featuring the ghazals of Ghalib, titled Ghalib and sung by Lata Mangeshkar. His collaborations with noted Marathi poets such as Shanta Shelke and Suresh Bhat have produced many Marathi classic songs of unmatched popularity.
He joined the political party Shiv Sena in 2009.

Christian Cambillau (born February 22, 1951) is a French scientist for the CNRS (French National Scientific Research Centre) in Structural Biology. He received the CNRS Silver Medal for his work on structural biology, especially the structures of human lipase/colipase, lectins and the development of moleculargraphics software.
Early life
Christian Cambillau was born in Perpignan to Madeleine Cambillau a social worker and August Cambillau an officer of the French airforce. He studied part of his childhood in different places (including Perpignan) and later in Paris when his family moved there. He obtained his Master in biology and chemistry at the University of Orsay, then continued on to do a Ph.D. at the same university in bio-mimetic chemistry (crown-ether and cryptates).
Career
After his Ph.D. (1978) he spent one year at ONERA for his military service. He was then hired by CNRS in the chemistry department (January 1, 1980). In 1982 he moved to Sweden to begin a two-year post-doc in the lab of Prof. Carl-Ivar Bränden, a pioneer of protein crystallography. Whilst there he worked to develop the TOM option in FRODO software, producing an automatic flexible protein-ligand docking software. He also participated to different works on protein crystallography and modelling.
After Sweden he returned to France to work in the relatively new field of structural biology, joining a group in the CRMC2 laboratory located in Marseille on the Luminy Campus (Marseille University of science). He worked there for four years and developed a new molecular graphics program TURBO-FRODO. He then moved with the protein crystallography group when it was relocated to the Marseille North University Department. It's at the North University Department that he led his first team at the LCCMB lab (Laboratory of Crystallography and Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules) with this becoming one of the key points of his career. Whilst director he moved in 1995 to the Campus of Joseph Aiguier, where LCCMB became AFMB (Architecture et Fonction de Macromolecule Biologiques). He resigned the direction of the AFMB in 2004, with AFMB moving to the Luminy Campus in 2005. Since 2008 he is Head of Marseille-Nice Génopole.

Award
CNRS Silver medal:
“Christian CAMBILLAU, 44, CNRS research director, supervises the Laboratory of crystallography and crystallization of biological macromolecules, an associated CNRS-University of Aix-Marseille 2 research unit. He is an international specialist in the field of structural biology (crystallography) and has developed a software for modeling molecules using data from X rays or NMR, making France one of the very few countries to have developed software in the field of biological crystallography. His most innovative and spectacular work concerns the interactions between proteins and sugars (structural glycobiology) and the structural analysis of lipases (enzymes which hydrolyse fat). Thus, he was able to crystallize for the first time a lectin and glycoprotein complex, making it possible to carry out a precise three-dimensional analysis of interactions between proteins and complex sugars. He has also described the structural movements which can activate pancreatic lipase in the presence of its lipid substrate. This research is extremely important from both a medical and a biotechnological point of view.”

Major General Lloyd Davidson Brown (July 28, 1892 – February 17, 1950) was a senior United States Army officer who served in both World War I and World War II. During the latter, he commanded the 28th Infantry Division, including during the Battle of Normandy in mid-1944.
Early life
Lloyd Davidson Brown was born in Sharon, Georgia on July 28, 1892. He graduated from Augusta's Academy of Richmond County in 1908, and the University of Georgia in 1912. He was a member of Phi Delta Theta and Phi Beta Kappa, and after graduating was employed as an instructor at Georgia Military Academy.
In 1917, the same year of the American entry into World War I, Brown received his commission in the United States Army as a second lieutenant in the Infantry Branch, and was originally assigned to the 26th Infantry Regiment. During the war he served on the Western Front as a company commander of 'G' Company, 2nd Battalion, 61st Infantry Regiment, part of the 5th Division of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF).
Post-World War I
With the war over due to the Armistice with Germany in November 1918, Brown's post-war assignments included Professor of Military Science at Riverside Military Academy in Gainesville, Georgia, and postings as a company commander and regimental Plans, Operations and Training (S3) staff officer for the 45th Infantry Regiment in the Philippines.
He graduated from the Infantry Officer Course in 1923, the Infantry Advanced Course in 1928, and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College in 1930.
In the late 1930s he served on the staff of the National Guard Bureau, and was an instructor and advisor for the Illinois Army National Guard's 131st Infantry Regiment. On July 1, 1940 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.
World War II
Brown served on the War Department staff at the start of the American entry into World War II, and subsequently served as Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations and Training (G3) at Headquarters, Army Ground Forces. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in the Army of the United States (AUS) on December 12, 1941. During the U.S. Army's huge wartime expansion he was accused of encouraging Regular Army officers to have senior officers of the National Guard replaced by writing negative performance evaluations on them, enabling Regular Army officers to fill these positions and receive promotions and command assignments.
In mid-1942 he became the assistant division commander (ADC) of the 102nd Infantry Division after receiving another promotion, this time to brigadier general (AUS), on May 24, 1942.
He remained in this position until January 1943 when he was reassigned to be the new commanding general (CG) of the 28th Infantry Division, an Army National Guard formation. He was taking over from Major General Omar Bradley, who had been sent to the North African Theater of Operations to be the personal representative of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander. Brown received yet another promotion, the third since December 1941 and America's entry into the war, this time to major general (AUS), on March 15, 1943. He led the division during training in the United States and left for the United Kingdom in October 1943, arriving in South Wales soon afterwards. The division trained there until late July 1944 when it was sent to Northern France to take part in the Allied invasion of Normandy, and saw its first combat in Operation Cobra, in an attempt to break out of the Normandy beachhead and end the temporary stalemate. He served until being relieved in August 1944 over concerns that his division was not progressing rapidly enough against German defenses.
Brown's performance and subsequent reputation were mixed. Major General Charles H. Corlett, then commanding the XIX Corps, thought Brown needed a medical leave because he was sick and "rundown." One of Brown's battalion commanders thought Brown was not up to the challenge of commanding large units in combat and described him as "frantic." Bradley, now a lieutenant general, commanding the U.S. 12th Army Group, and Eisenhower believed Brown was personally brave, but not an inspirational leader, and that his soldiers under performed as a result. Unlike several other division commanders who were relieved and later received second opportunities to command, such as Terry Allen and Orlando Ward, in Brown's case Eisenhower recommended to General George C. Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, that he not be given another command, and Marshall concurred. Brown was replaced by James Edward Wharton, although he was killed by a sniper while visiting his front line units soon after he took command. Wharton in turn was replaced by Brigadier General Norman Cota, who had distinguished himself under fire on D-Day and was highly regarded by his superiors.
Brown relinquished his temporary rank of both brigadier general and major general and reverted to his permanent rank of colonel and served in various staff assignments, including Director of Training at the U.S. Army Infantry School, until retiring from the army on 31 December 1948. Upon retirement, he was promoted to major general on the retired list.
Death and burial
Brown died in Washington, Georgia on February 17, 1950, at the relatively young age of just 57, and was buried at Resthaven Cemetery in Washington.
Legacy
His home in Washington, Georgia, the Leitner-Norris Home, was built circa 1814. It is still a privately owned residence, and a local historic landmark.
Lloyd Brown Hall at Fort Benning was named for him.

Cinema Europe: The Other Hollywood (1995) is a documentary film series produced by David Gill and silent film historian Kevin Brownlow. It is a follow-up to their 1980 documentary film series, Hollywood.
Overview
The six-part mini-series focuses on the origin of European cinema, from its infancy as a novelty created by French inventors Auguste and Louis Lumière to its flourishing as the pinnacle of film-making in the silent era and as a serious commercial contender against America (that is, until the surge of the Nazis). The important series contains much rare footage and offers an even-handed analysis of the specific strengths and weaknesses of the various national film industries during this first flourishing of film as art.
The documentary is narrated by filmmaker and actor Kenneth Branagh. Original music in the film was composed by Carl Davis, Philip Appleby & Nic Raine.
The series originally aired on the BBC in 1995, and on Turner Classic Movies in the US in 1996. In 2000, Image Entertainment released the whole series on a 2-disc DVD (3 episodes on each disc) totaling 348 minutes.
The documentary was shown from time to time on public television stations, usually at late night slots, due to its length and occasional sexual frankness.
Episodes
The documentary is divided into the following episodes (with original BBC airdates):

The Diawling National Park lies in south west Mauritania around the Senegal River delta. During the rainy season, much of the park consists of large lakes. It is known for having over 220 species of identified birds, including pelicans, black storks, and flamingos, and also for its fish.
Geography and establishment
Diawling National Park was established in 1991. The park sprawls over an area of 16,000 hectares, all of which was once a floodplain. The Senegal River acts like a boundary between the park and the Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary, which was established in 1971. The Djoudj National Bird Sanctuary is located in the Republic of Senegal. The opposition to the establishment of the Diawling National Park came mostly from the local inhabitants, who feared a similar fate as that of the populace of Djoudj. They were fearful of the consequences of a protected area, which would mean that grazing and fishing would be prohibited or limited, ending a way of life that their tribes had always known.
Diawling is part of a Trans-Border Biosphere Reserve that is a popular bird nesting site because of the combination of fresh and salt water at the Senegal River delta. The park also has a significant population of primates, wart hogs and wild donkeys.
Some of the region's worst malaria is found in this area, due to the construction some years ago of a dam built in the area. Bilharzia and invasive plant species have also taken hold.
Diawling National Park is home to a remarkable variety of birds. The species found here include northern pintail (Anas acuta), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus), lesser flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor), Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), African spoonbill (Platalea alba), great egret (Casmerodius albus), great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), Arabian bustard (Ardeotis arabs), pied avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta), slender-billed gull (Larus genei), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), greater hoopoe-lark (Alaemon alaudipes) and Sudan golden sparrow (Passer luteus).
Mammals
Nature and man combined to obliterate some species in Diawling. Some of the larger mammals perished due to prolonged drought and excessive hunting. The last remaining West African lion (Panthera leo leo) in Diawling was shot in 1970, and the last sighting of the red-fronted gazelle was in 1991. Today, the only mammals in the park are Spotted hyenas, African golden wolves, warthogs, African wildcats, Cape hares and patas monkeys. Other species like the manatee, crocodile, and hippopotamus disappeared with the construction of the dam.

The Brodhead-Bell-Morton Mansion, also known as the Levi P. Morton House is a historic Beaux-Arts home, located at 1500 Rhode Island Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D.C., in the Logan Circle neighborhood.
History
It was built in 1879, to the designs of architect John Fraser, and comprehensively remodeled in 1912 by architect John Russell Pope.
The Beaux-Arts style building originally served as the private residence of John. T. Brodhead, and Jessie Willis Brodhead.
Between 1939 and 2016, the building served as offices for the National Paint, Varnish, and Lacquer Association (now known as the American Coatings Association).
Former occupants include Alexander Graham Bell and his wife Mabel Gardiner Hubbard, U.S. Vice President Levi P. Morton, the Embassy of Russia, and U.S. Secretary of State Elihu Root.
The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites.
In February 2016 the Mansion was purchased from American Coatings Association by Hungary to move the Embassy of Hungary there later in the year.

World Cultures is an electronic peer-reviewed academic journal of cross-cultural studies. It was founded in 1985 by Douglas R. White, editor-in-chief until 1990, followed by Greg Truex 1991, J. Patrick Gray (1992-2014), and Greg Truex (2015-16). William Divale was the publisher until 2008, when the journal moved from print and CD-ROM format to online format. It is hosted as an eScholarship journal that publishes cross-cultural research articles and computerized codebooks and datasets. These include the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, Western North American Indians, an Atlas of Archaeology, the Ethnographic Atlas (Murdock, 1967), and Lewis Binford's Constructing Frames of Reference: An Analytical Method for Archaeological Theory Building Using Ethnographic and Environmental Data Sets (2001) and numerous other topics. Numerous software programs for cross-cultural analysis have also been published.
Background
Part of the purpose of the journal is to provide codebooks and data that are in the public domain for scientific use, at minimal cost of distribution, both to support scientific work and instructional use. New as well as legacy issues of the journal are at the free on-line site of the California Digital Library. The largest of the databases supported by the journal to date are the contributed multiauthored coded data for the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, now numbering over 2,000 coded variables on 186 societies by over 90 different contributing authors.

The Canadian Group of Painters (CGP) was a collective of 28 painters from across Canada who came together as a group in 1933.
Formation
The Canadian Group of Painters succeeded the disbanded Group of Seven, whose paintings of the Canadian wilderness had been a strong influence on Canadian art. In the early 1930s, the Group of Seven's prominence had caused controversy as many believed that the National Gallery of Canada exhibited favouritism for their work and they were the only Canadian artists to receive global recognition. Concern over the Gallery's potential bias and exclusion of modern artists led to the formation of the Canadian Group of Painters in February 1933.
The group was made up of 28 different English-speaking painters from across Canada with Lawren Harris as their inaugural president. Several of the other Group of Seven painters were also included in the new group including A. J. Casson, Arthur Lismer, A. Y. Jackson, F.H. Varley and Franklin Carmichael.
Although the group never created a manifesto, they lived and worked with two objectives: to foster closer cooperation between Canadian artists and to encourage and cultivate Canadian artistic expression.
History
Their first exhibition of "nationalist art" was held in Atlantic City, New Jersey in November 1933. They showcased 57 works at the Heinz Art Salon, which proved to be a great international venue to showcase their brand. However, the pieces that gained the most recognition and press were still the Group of Seven works. The first CGP exhibition in Canada was held in November 1933. The exhibit was less restrictive in style and featured a wider range of works that fell outside of the Canadian landscape style.
Their next exhibition was not held until January 1936 at the Art Gallery of Toronto. The significant delay was caused by a variety of scandals between group members, including an affair between Lawren Harris and Bess Larkin Housser, fellow artist and the wife of CGP's secretary, Fred Housser. Harris stepped down as president and A. Y. Jackson took the lead with vice presidents Arthur Lismer and Prudence Heward in 1936. The group held a number of exhibitions under their new leadership and were making strides towards a unified style.
The Eastern Group of Painters was formed in Montreal, Quebec in 1938 to counteract the influence of the Canadian Group of Painters.
Influence
As active painters and as a group they continued to produce and influence Canadian art for many years. The Canadian Group of Painters organized exhibitions of the works of the Beaver Hall Group. Walter Yarwood, who was a member of the Canadian Group of Painters, was also a founding member of Painters Eleven.
A Vital Force: The Canadian Group of Painters (CGP) (2013), which was curated by Alicia Boutilier for the Agnes Etherington Art Centre, was the first major touring exhibition to focus exclusively on the CGP in an exhibition of major paintings from public and private collections across Canada.

Rancho Point () is a conspicuous rock headland, 170 m, marking the east extremity of Deception Island, in the South Shetland Islands. It rises from the sea to become a large rock which, because of its shape, has received the name. The name was proposed by the commander of the Argentine ship Granville in the year 1947 through having observed, by chance, that the feature resembles a hut with a double-pitched roof.

In astrology, an aspect is an angle a planet makes to another planet or point of astrological interest. As the second-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon, often prominent during the morning or evening, Venus has aspects that are readily apparent to the casual eye. They were of historical importance in the development of geocentric and ultimately heliocentric models of the Solar System.
Aspects of the planet Venus
The table contains special positions of Venus until 2021. In general, Venus (or Mercury) is an "evening star" when it has an eastern elongation from the Sun, and is a "morning star" when it has a western elongation.
Note: Greatest brilliancy is often confused with "maximum brightness". Although they are related, they are not quite the same thing. The "greatest brilliancy" is really a geometric maximum: it occurs when the apparent area of the sunlit part of Venus is greatest. Only if the luminance of Venus' apparent surface would be constant (i.e. the same at every point and at every phase) would the "greatest brilliancy" of Venus coincide with its maximum brightness. However, the reflection of sunlight on Venus more closely follows Lambert's law, which means that the maximum brightness occurs at a somewhat larger phase of Venus than its greatest brilliancy.

This is a list of individual combat equipment issued by the United States Marine Corps. This list does not include items that are issued as uniforms or weapons and ordnance.
Many items on this list have nicknames. See list of United States Marine Corps acronyms and expressions.
Defensive
Ballistic vests
The Improved Modular Tactical Vest (IMTV) is the newest and most advanced vest in Marine inventories, with better protection and mobility than previous vests and a quick-release.
The Improved Scalable Plate Carrier was developed for troops in Afghanistan because of concerns of excessive weight limiting mobility, especially in mountainous terrain.
The Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT) vest remains in some limited use in training and non-deployable units.
The Full Spectrum Battle Equipment kit includes a quick-release ballistic vest, integrated breathing and flotation devices, as well as load bearing equipment.
The Combat Integrated Releasable Armor System (CIRAS) has replaced the FSBE AAV for some units.
The PRU-70 for aviators and aircrew combines body armor, survival vest, and flotation device.
Combat helmets
The Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) is a made of high-strength polyethylene with superior ballistic protection compared to previous Kevlar helmets. The ECH is being issued only to deployed units and will be turned in upon return and given to other combat units. Previous helmets like the LWH are being retained for training and noncombat use.
The Lightweight Helmet (LWH) can be used with the older sling suspension or a newer pad suspension to fit the helmet to the head, as well as a nape protection system to add ballistic protection to the rear of the head.
The MICH TC-2000 Combat Helmet is issued to some specialized units.
The Enhanced Combat Vehicle Crewman's Helmet (ECVCH) allows the crew of M1 Abrams, AAV, and LAV vehicles to communicate with less restriction on mobility and situational awareness without reducing ballistic protection.
Most pilots and aircrew wear a flight helmet for protection from aviation-related hazards (such as an integrated oxygen mask), but typically offers little ballistic protection.
The Pith helmet is worn not for ballistic protection, but to identify weapons range coaches and other range personnel.
Other armor
Small Arms Protective Inserts (SAPI) are used with the MTV and OTV to provide protection beyond what the vest itself offers. SAPI are also available in side plates to protect the torso.
The OTV can be adapted with the Armor Protective Enhancement System (APES) that adds ballistic protection to the shoulder, armpit, and upper arm.
The Advanced Bomb Suit is used by Explosive Ordnance Disposal.
The Sea Dragon 2025 is a experimental battledress being tested for the US Marine Corps as a replacement for the Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform
Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense
The M50 joint service general purpose mask is the standard gas mask.
Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) is a nuclear, biological, chemical suit with overalls, a hooded jacket, gloves, and overboots to protect against direct contact with contaminants.
The Mk I Nerve Agent Antidote Kit (NAAK) consists of a pair of autoinjectors containing atropine sulfate and pralidoxime chloride for first aid against nerve agents, and are due to be replaced by the single ATNAA.
Load-bearing & packs
The Family of Improved Load Bearing Equipment (FILBE) is the latest load bearing equipment to be issued to Marines. It replaced the previous ILBE because of incompatibility with body armour systems. The FILBE system is a solid coyote brown color. It is a modular system that allows its users to configure the system to individual/mission need. It consists of a larger framed rucksack, labeled "USMC MAIN PACK," a smaller assault-style pack, labeled "USMC ASSAULT PACK," and a three-liter CamelBak hydration carrier.
The standard canvas or nylon seabag, a militarized duffel bag, has been issued to service members of all branches since before World War II. However, the increase in equipment issued to an individual Marine has made containing and transporting it all in a standard seabag difficult (a phenomenon nicknamed seabag drag), in addition to a tactical load-bearing pack. The deployment bag holds the same cubic footage, but rugged wheels allow it to roll much like a ruggedized version of commercial rolling luggage.
A rubberized waterproofing bag liner has been provided to Marines for decades as a way to protect the contents of a tactical pack from water. Newer versions (known as the "stuff sack") have a purge valve to expel excess air to compress the sack.
The gunslinger pack allows a scout sniper to conceal and protect his sniper rifle within the pack while on the move.
Clothing
Cold weather clothing
All Purpose Environmental Clothing System (APECS): Rather than issue the 3rd generation Extended Cold Weather Clothing System (ECWCS), the Marine Corps issues the APECS, consisting of a MARPAT parka and pant. The APECS is structurally almost identical to ECWCS shell jacket and trousers.
The Lightweight Exposure Suit offers similar capabilities.
The Combat Desert Jacket is a lighter suit to protect Marines from the harsh desert climate.
The Extreme Cold Weather Parka & Trouser offer heavy protection from cold weather, and include overboots.
The Snow Camouflage Uniform is a winter MARPAT overgarment to camouflage Marines and their equipment in snow.
Polypropylene undershirt and underdrawer, nicknamed "polypro" and officially known as "silkweight", is a mock turtleneck and trousers designed to be worn next to skin, and designed by Polartec. Flame-resistant versions are available.
The Grid Fleece Midweight underwear includes a pullover and pants (in green and coyote brown). While the pullover is commonly issued as a warming layer in most locations, the pants are traditionally not issued unless the recipient is expected to face a cold weather environment. Flame-resistant versions are available.
A cap made from microfleece is given to Marines in most environments.
Cold weather socks and scarfs are also offered to Marines going to cold weather environments.
Mountain/Cold Weather Boots, later renamed Rugged All Terrain (RAT) Boots, and Extreme Cold Vapor Barrier Boots are given. The overboots are insulated with an air barrier, and include a valve to allow paratroopers to jump with them, while the RAT Boot is reinforced with chemically impregnated leather for durability and stability.
Other
The Flame Resistant Organizational Gear (FROG) is a fire and heat protection system designed to help protect Marines from burn injuries associated with roadside bombs.
Units with firefighting capabilities (Marine Wing Support Squadrons and Headquarters and Headquarters Squadrons ) are issued firefighting suits and self-contained breathing apparatus.
Coveralls or jumpsuits are issued to vehicle crew, mechanics, and other Marines whose duties may render other uniforms unserviceable. They can have varying degrees of fire protection, and come in green and coyote brown to match the seasonal change of utilities from woodland to desert camouflage. Pilots and aircrew typically wear flight suits and flight jackets, as well as g-suit, pressure suits, and life vests as needed.
Various gloves are offered by the Corps. Often, most Marines receive simply a woolen liner and leather shell, however, those who require more specialized gloves are issued them (cold weather, hazmat, Mechanix brand, etc.).
The Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform has built-in slots for knee and elbow pads, but many Marines prefer to purchase their own pads. The Commandant has authorized units to purchase knee and elbow pads for uniformity.
The Corps is also contracting to receive protective silk underwear in use by the British Army. While not designed for ballistic protection, the so-called "blast boxers" do provide wound mitigation to groin injuries.
Other
The Individual First Aid Kit (IFAK) is used for immediate battlefield treatment. It includes several bandages, a tourniquet, burn ointment, some water purification tablets, and QuikClot combat gauze, a kaolin-infused gauze bandage.
Individual Water Purification System allows Marines to purify water to potable standards. These can be compatible with the standard issue hydration pack, similar to CamelBak brand packs. Plastic 1-quart canteens are issued as well, with a metal canteen cup and stand.
Several types of eye protection are offered, including ballistic goggles and sunglasses made by Eye Safety Systems, Inc. and Wiley X, and are available with prescription lens inserts.
Ballistic Hearing Protection is a two-sided earplug that offers Marines protection from audio damage.
The entrenching tool or "E-tool" is standard issue to all Marines to prepare defensive fighting positions.
All Marines usually receive a foam sleeping mat, a Modular Sleep System (with light, heavy, or waterproof sleeping bag to allow the user to adapt to ambient conditions and a compression sack to hold them), and a tarpaulin or waterproof poncho and liner that doubles as an expedient blanket.
The Sidewinder HandHeld FlashLight (HHFL) is lightweight with a head adjustable over 185° of movement, light-emitting diodes providing five intensities each of white, red, blue, and infrared light (including a strobe function), helmet mount, and runs on AA batteries. Aside from providing illumination, the flashlight can be used for signalling and detecting blood residue.
There is no standard tactical light. Many Marines choose to purchase their own.
The Martial Arts Kit (MAK) allows units to train Marines in the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program. It contains all of the pads, gloves, props, and other safety aids that allow an instructor to successfully teach the program.
The Mechanical Breacher's Kit (MBK) allows an assault breacher to breach a door or other obstacle.
Various mountain-warfare items have been fielded, including snowshoes, skis, climbing kits, and Portable/camping stoves.
Numerous parachutes are used, such as the static line T-10 and T-11, Military Free Fall Parachute System, and various aviation-specific models used for aircrew survival.
Many Marines are also issued K-Bar style fighting knives, often made by companies other than K-Bar, such as Camillus and Ontario.

The Okobie road tanker explosion occurred on 12 July 2012 when a tank truck in Okobie, Nigeria, fell into a ditch, spilled its petrol contents, and subsequently exploded, killing at least 121.
The tanker attempted to avoid a collision with two cars and a bus, veered into a ditch, and spilled fuel. Hundreds of locals rushed to the scene to take some of the spilled petrol.
About 40 minutes after the accident, the tanker exploded. The death toll was initially placed at 95, including 93 people who perished instantly and two who died after being brought to hospital. The death toll was later revised to 121 after more bodies were recovered from neighboring villages where they had been taken by their relatives. The number of injured was at least 75, although the actual number was likely higher as some were treated by relatives or at private clinics. Some 34 motorcycle taxis were destroyed. The drivers of the motorcycles, known as Okada in Nigeria, came to scoop up spilled fuel for their vehicles after learning of the accident and became victims of the explosion.
In separate statements, the Nigerian National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and the Federal Road Safety Commission of Rivers State gave the same figures for the incident. The NEMA statement also said that "rescue workers from the police, road safety, fire service, civil defence and NEMA were at the scene to evacuate victims and control traffic". Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said he was "deeply saddened by the loss of many lives" and "particularly distraught by the fact that, once again, so many Nigerian lives have been lost in an avoidable fuel fire disaster". Jonathan was referring to two previous incidents: one in March 2012 killing six people and one in April 2011 killing 50.

Henry Alfred Ivatt (16 September 1851, Wentworth, Cambridgeshire – 25 October 1923) was an English railway engineer, and was the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Great Northern Railway from 1896 to 1911.
Career
London and North Western Railway
Educated at Liverpool College., at age 17, Ivatt was apprenticed to John Ramsbottom at the Crewe Works of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). He worked as a fireman for six months and held various positions there. He was made head of the Holyhead Locomotive Depot in 1874, before being promoted to the head of the Chester District.
Great Southern and Western Railway
In 1877, Ivatt moved to Ireland, and the Great Southern and Western Railway at Inchicore. In 1882, he was appointed to the post of locomotive engineer there, where he patented a design for a sprung flap for vertically-opening carriage windows that became ubiquitous.
Great Northern Railway

Kim Kirim (Korean: 김기림; Hanja: 金起林; May 11, 1908 – ?) was a Korean poet and literary critic who represented Korean modernist literature in the 1930s. Kim wrote monumental poems such as “The Weather Chart” (1936), “Wind Speed of the Sun” (1939), and “The Sea and the Butterfly” (1939) during the Japanese colonial period. In pursuing a new spirit of poetry, he criticized sentimental romanticism in the 1920s and the movement of the Korean Artists' Proletarian Federation (KARF), which based its literary theory and practice on left-wing ideologies. Kim was one of the first intellectualists who introduced modernism to the Korean literary circle and emphasized rationality by means of the compressibility of poetry. Being active as a literary critic, he introduced great Korean writers such as Yi Sang, Baek Seok, and Jeong Ji-yong to the literary world through his critique and papers. After Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule, Kim took part in the progressive Chosun Writer's Union along with the writers Jeong Ji-yong and Lee Tae-jun and called for the role of literature in building a new nation by its active engagement in reality.
Life and Education
Kim was born in Haksung, North Hamgyeong Province in 1908. Kim went to Immyeong Primary School in 1914, and his childhood name was known as In-son Kim, his pen name being Pyeonseokchon. In 1921, Kim quit Posung Middle School in Seoul and transferred to Rikkyo Middle School in Tokyo to continue his studies. In 1930, he graduated from Nihon University with a bachelor's degree in literary arts. After returning to Korea, Kim started his literary career as a newspaper reporter in the department of art and science in the Chosun Ilbo, one of the largest newspaper companies in the nation. In 1931, he temporarily returned to his hometown and concentrated on his writing while cultivating an orchard called Moogokwon.
In September 1933, he participated in the foundation of the Circle of Nine, a literary association located in Seoul, with famous Korean writers such as Yi Sang, Lee Hyo-seok, Park Taewon, and Kim Yujung. While working as a founding member of the association, he played the role of the forerunner in incorporating modernism with the literature of the times and participated in introducing intellectualism with the writers such as Lee Yang-ha and Choi Jae-seo. Afterward, he was to resign from the Chosun Ilbo to study further in Japan, but Bang Eung-mo, the president of the company, allowed him to take a leave of absence and funded his tuition from the company's scholarship committee. In 1936, Kim entered the Department of English at Tohoku University located in Sendai. In 1939, he graduated with a thesis on the theory of I. A. Richards, a British literary critic. After returning to Korea, he went back to work as a reporter in the Chosun Ilbo and later served as the head of the department of arts.
Meanwhile, Kim had no choice but quit his job due to the forced closure of the Chosun Ilbo in 1940 by the Japanese colonial government. In 1942, he worked as an English teacher at Gyeongseong Middle School near his hometown. It was known that Kim Kyu-dong, a Korean poet, was one of his disciples then. In January 1946, right after the liberation of Korea from Japanese colonial rule, he crossed the 38th parallel and moved from communist North Korea to liberalist South Korea. At that time, Kim's books and properties were all taken away by force, so he had no choice but to live in poverty. During the establishment of the South Korean government in June 1947, however, he crossed the border again to bring his family members who were staying in Pyongyang. He succeeded in moving to South Korea with three of his children first; his wife and the youngest son made it later, in the spring of 1948. Afterward, Kim secured a teaching position at Chung-Ang University and Yonsei University and later became an assistant professor at Seoul National University, where he founded the New Culture Research Institute and worked as the director. He was reportedly abducted by the state political security department of North Korea after the Korean War broke out, and the time and whereabouts of his death have not been known until now.
Literary Career
Kim started his literary career by publishing several poems including “Away to the New Life” in 1930, when he was working as a journalist in the department of arts in Chosun Ilbo. In 1931, he made his debut as a literary critic by publishing the reviews, “Pierrot's Monologue” and “The Technique, Perception, and Reality of Poetry” and worked actively as a poet and critic. In 1936, he published his first collection of poems, The Weather Chart, which was known to have been influenced by T. S. Eliot's poem, “The Waste Land.” Kim issued his second collection of poems, Wind Speed of the Sun in 1939, of which some poems were characterized by intellectualism and its clever play of words. Meanwhile, he wrote three pieces of novels and plays including the mid-length novel, The Land beside a Railway (1935-1936), but did not receive much attention.
In the middle of his literary career, Kim's works showed criticism towards capitalism and self-awareness as an intellectual. This was due to the global trend of anxiety and realization of the inhumanity of modernization. During this period, Kim argued that poetry should carry the spirit of the times and that visual or pictorial poetry without firm ideas was another form of purism. He believed that poets were identified as the intelligentsia, a by-product of capitalist society, and were tasked with conveying the values of the times to the public.
The latter part of Kim's career started around Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. During this period, Kim sought to meet the demand of the time by publishing writings that emphasized the interconnectedness between literature and reality. Also, he called for writers' social involvement, which was viewed as the realization of his theory of “Total poetics”. That is, he claimed that poetry should deliver the spirit of the times by finding and pursuing the balance between modernist techniques and critical social awareness. In this light, the post-liberation era was the right time for Kim to put his conviction into practice, encouraging the poets to speak for the public in the community life. After the liberation, he published two collections of poems, The Sea and the Butterfly, in 1946, and The New song in 1947. The Sea and the Butterfly was notable for its transparent image of the limitations of life and the poet's willingness to overcome them. In contrast to the gloomy and private atmosphere of The Sea and the Butterfly, Kim showed a strong will to build a new nation in The New Song to beat defeatism of the time.
Kim also published several reviews and books. Some of his representative works include Poetics (1947) and Understanding Poetry (1950). The former was known as an important collection of theories of poetry that transformed the history of Korean literature by introducing Western imagery and intellectualism in the 1930s; the latter was considered as an enlightenment literature which was written on the basis of I.A. Richards' theory of psychology.

The Sea and the Butterfly
“The Sea and the Butterfly” (1939) is one of Kim's major works, published in the literary magazine called Women. This poem is included in the Korean Middle and High Schools' literature textbooks to show the representative work of intellectualism. The poem illustrates both the longing and frustration for the new world by the contrast of two colors, blue and white. Also, the poem introduces two concepts that do not match with one another: the sea and the butterfly. The former represents the cruel and eerie reality of the colonial era or the new civilization of the times while the latter symbolizes the fragile intellectuals who are unable to put up with the external world. The poem shows a type of pictorial modernism, which was a new attempt in the Korean literary world at the time.
The Sea and the Butterfly (1939)
Because nobody told her how deep the water is,
The white butterfly is never afraid of the sea.
She descents, thinking it is a blue radish farm,
Then jadedly returns like a princess
With her callow wings soaked by the waves.
A blue crescent moon is chilly at the waist of the butterfly
Who is sad because the March sea hasn't bloomed.
바다와 나비
아무도 그에게 수심(水深)을 일러 준 일이 없기에
흰나비는 도무지 바다가 무섭지 않다.
청(靑)무우 밭인가 해서 내려갔다가는
어린 날개가 물결에 절어서
공주(公主)처럼 지쳐서 돌아온다.
삼월(三月)달 바다가 꽃이 피지 않아서 서글픈
나비 허리에 새파란 초생달이 시리다.
Criticism
Influenced by the writers and theorists such as T. S. Eliot, T. E. Hulme, and I. A. Richards, Kim is considered to have learned the literary theory of Western modernism relatively accurately in early days. However, since he did not have a clear understanding of the cultural basis and philosophical foundation of modernism, his first collection of poems, The Weather Chart (1936), is criticized as experimental, which lacks a clear, unified theme. It is said that The Weather Chart reveals some problems regarding the form. Critics state that there is a lack of awareness in the rhythm and musicality of the language. It is assumed that Kim inadvertently disregarded these elements while he attempted to convey visual impressions through the language. The Weather Chart, however, was believed to be successful in integrating ideas and senses and criticizing the modern capitalist civilization. In addition, Kim's last collection of poems, The New Song (1948), was recognized for its suggestion of a new direction in establishing a national identity, but was evaluated as lacking maturity as a work of art.

Toogoolawah War Memorial is a heritage-listed memorial within McConnel Park at Cressbrook Street, Toogoolawah, Somerset Region, Queensland, Australia. The park was built by Frank Williams & Co. It is also known as McConnel Park. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.
History
The site was established as a public park and recreational facility c.1906, on land donated by James Henry McConnel of Cressbrook.
James' father, David Cannon McConnel, was the first European to settle in the Brisbane Valley, taking up the Cressbrook run in 1841. In the late 1890s, JH McConnel established a condensed milk factory on Cressbrook Creek, and subdivided a large part of the run into dairy farms and the township of Cressbrook Creek (later Toogoolawah). Such private town subdivisions were not unusual in Queensland; other towns originating in this manner include Beaudesert, Nambour and Childers.
The McConnel family was deeply involved in the economic and social development of Toogoolawah, encouraging cultural, religious, sporting recreational and economic activity. They employed a contractor to build homes for their farmers; donated land for church purposes; and promoted a variety of district clubs, organisations and societies. Their establishment of a recreational facility in the centre of town remains testimony to the family's genuine concern for community welfare.
In 1919 a brass band was formed in Toogoolawah, and about this time a small bandstand, understood to have been provided by the McConnel family, was erected in the recreational ground. By 1924 the park also contained a tennis court and a public shower, water for which was supplied from a public well and windmill on the site. A cricket pitch was laid down c.1930, and a Guide hut and Scout den were erected in the 1970s.
The property was placed under trusteeship in 1926, and the Esk Shire Council became the trustees in 1940.
The First World War stone memorial was commissioned by the citizens of Toogoolawah in 1916. It was crafted by Ipswich monumental masons Frank Williams & Co., who later supplied most of the First World War memorials in the district. The memorial, which cost £300, was unveiled on 31 March 1917 by Rev Chaplain Merrington. It was the second such memorial erected in Queensland, and the first outside a cemetery.
Originally the memorial enclosure was separated from the rest of the park by a picket fence. Gardens were laid out by 1921, and on Anzac Day that year a First World War gun was unveiled beside the memorial.
A metal plate, honouring 15 local citizens who gave their lives in the Second World War, was attached to the memorial in 1955. In 1988 two additional plaques were attached commemorating those who had served in post-1945 conflicts.
A cairn containing a time-capsule was placed in the park for the 1988 bi-centenary.

SMS Lothringen was the last of five pre-dreadnought battleships of the , built for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy). She was laid down in December 1902, was launched in May 1904, and was commissioned in May 1906. She was named for the then-German province of Lothringen (now Lorraine). The ship was armed with a battery of four guns and had a top speed of . Like all other pre-dreadnoughts built around the turn of the century, Lothringen was quickly made obsolete by the launching of the revolutionary in 1906; as a result, her career as a front-line battleship was cut short.
Lothringens peacetime career centered on squadron and fleet exercises and training cruises with II Battle Squadron. Scheduled to be withdrawn from service in July 1914 and replaced by newer dreadnought battleships, the outbreak of World War I that month prevented her retirement. She spent the first two years of the war primarily serving as a guard ship in the German Bight. She and the rest of II Squadron joined the dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet to support the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby in December 1914. In poor condition by 1916, she was withdrawn from fleet service in February. She thereafter patrolled the Danish straits until she was replaced by the battleship in September 1917. She spent the rest of the war as a disarmed training ship.
After the war, Lothringen was retained by the re-formed Reichsmarine and converted into a depot ship for F-type minesweepers from 1919 to 1920. After the task of clearing the wartime minefields in the North Sea was completed, she was placed in reserve in March 1920. The ship remained inactive for the next decade and was stricken from the naval register in March 1931 and sold to ship breakers later that year.
Design
With the passage of the Second Naval Law under the direction of Vizeadmiral (VAdm—Vice Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz in 1900, funding was allocated for a new class of battleships, to succeed the ships authorized under the 1898 Naval Law. By this time, Krupp, the supplier of naval artillery to the Kaiserliche Marine had developed quick-firing, 28-centimeter guns; the largest guns that had previously incorporated the technology were the guns mounted on the Wittelsbachs. The Design Department of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office) adopted these guns for the new battleships, along with an increase from to for the secondary battery, owing to the increased threat from torpedo boats as torpedoes became more effective.
Though the Braunschweig class marked a significant improvement over earlier German battleships, its design fell victim to the rapid pace of technological development in the early 1900s. The British battleship —armed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) guns—was commissioned in December 1906, just six months after Lothringen entered service. Dreadnoughts revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including Lothringen.
Lothringen was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as designed and at Full load. Her crew consisted of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical triple expansion engines that drove three screws. Steam was provided by eight naval and six cylindrical Scotch marine boilers, all of which burned coal. Lothringens powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She could steam at a cruising speed of .
Lothringens armament consisted of a main battery of four 28 cm (11 in) SK L/40 guns in twin gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen 17 cm (6.7 inch) SK L/40 guns in armored casemates and eighteen 8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/35 quick-firing guns in single pivot mounts. The armament suite was rounded out with six torpedo tubes, all mounted submerged in the hull. One tube was in the bow, two were on each broadside, and the final tube was in the stern. Lothringen was protected with Krupp armor. Her armored belt was thick, with the heavier armor in the central citadel that protected her magazines and propulsion machinery spaces, and the thinner plating at either end of the hull. Her deck was thick. The main battery turrets had 250 mm of armor plating.
Service history
Construction through 1907
Lothringen was laid down on 1 December 1902, at the Schichau-Werke in Danzig under construction number 716. The fifth and final unit of her class, she was ordered under the contract name "M" as a new unit for the fleet. Lothringen was launched on 27 May 1904 and the launching speech was given by Prince Hermann of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the Reichsstatthalter (Imperial governor) of Alsace-Lorraine. She was commissioned into the fleet on 18 May 1906 and thereafter began sea trials. The ship formally joined II Battle Squadron on 1 July.
The German fleet was occupied with extensive training exercises and cruises abroad during the early 1900s. The fleet, including Lothringen, began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July, and it was present for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3 August. The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland, to join exercises being conducted there. The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22–24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in Eckernförde Bay outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September, in Kiel. The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days.
The ship participated in the uneventful winter cruise into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December. The first quarter of 1907 followed the previous pattern and, on 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-designated the High Seas Fleet. Lothringen participated in the festival celebrating the 300th anniversary of the birth of the Dutch admiral Michiel de Ruyter, steaming from Kiel to Vlissingen on 19 March 1907. From the end of May to early June the fleet went on its summer cruise in the North Sea, returning to the Baltic via the Kattegat. This was followed by the regular cruise to Norway from 12 July to 10 August, after which the fleet conducted the annual autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 26 August to 6 September. The exercises included landing exercises in northern Schleswig with IX Corps. Lothringen won the Kaiser's Schießpreis (shooting prize) for excellence in gunnery in II Squadron that year.
1908–1914
The fleet conducted training exercises in the Baltic in February 1908. In July, Lothringen and the rest of the fleet sailed into the Atlantic Ocean to conduct a major training cruise. Prince Heinrich had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up the monotony of training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing Anglo-German naval arms race were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to the North Sea, and continued to the Atlantic through the English Channel. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September. Later that year, the fleet toured coastal German cities as part of an effort to increase public support for naval expenditure. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August 1909. On the way back to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British Royal Navy in Spithead.
Later that year, Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff became the fleet commander. Holtzendorff's tenure was marked by strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat the latest underwater weapons posed and the fact that the new s were too wide to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910. In May 1910, the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the Kattegat. These were in accordance with Holtzendorff's strategy, which envisioned drawing the Royal Navy into the narrow waters there. The annual summer cruise was to Norway and was followed by fleet training, during which another fleet review was held in Danzig on 29 August. A training cruise into the Baltic followed at the end of the year. In March 1911, the fleet held exercises in the Skagerrak and Kattegat, and the year's autumn maneuvers were confined to the Baltic and the Kattegat. Another fleet review was held during the exercises for a visiting Austro-Hungarian delegation that included Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli.
Lothringen was sent into the Little Belt in February 1912 to assist merchant vessels threatened by heavy sea ice and bad weather. In mid-1912, due to the Agadir Crisis, the summer cruise was confined to the Baltic, to avoid exposing the fleet during the period of heightened tension with Britain and France. Lothringen visited Memel from 3 to 7 August that year. On 30 January 1913, Holtzendorff was relieved as the fleet commander, owing in large part to Kaiser Wilhelm II's displeasure with his strategic vision. In late August, the squadron steamed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal at the start of the autumn maneuvers to reach the island of Helgoland; the voyage through the canal was notable, because the canal had been closed for over a year while it was enlarged to allow the passage of larger dreadnought battleships. Further training exercises were conducted in November.
Lothringen participated in ceremonies at Sonderburg on 2 May 1914 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Dybbøl of the Second Schleswig War; she was joined by her sister ships and , the battleship , and the armored cruiser . The ship was present during the fleet cruise to Norway in July 1914, which was cut short by the July Crisis following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand the month before and subsequent rise in international tensions. On 25 July the ship's crew was made aware of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia; Lothringen left Norway to rendezvous with the rest of the fleet the following day. The ship had been scheduled to be removed from service on 30 July, but the outbreak of war interrupted that plan and she remained in service.
World War I
After the outbreak of war in July 1914, the German command deployed II Squadron in the German Bight to defend Germany's coast from a major attack from the Royal Navy that the Germans presumed was imminent. Lothringen and her squadron mates were stationed in the mouth of the Elbe to support the vessels on patrol duty in the Bight. Once it became clear that the British would not attack the High Seas Fleet, the Germans began a series of operations designed to lure out a portion of the numerically superior British Grand Fleet and destroy it. By achieving a rough equality of forces, the Germans hoped that their fleet could then force a decisive battle in the southern portion of the North Sea.
The first such operation in which the High Seas Fleet participated was the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby on 15–16 December 1914. The main fleet acted as distant support for Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Franz von Hipper's battlecruiser squadron while it raided the coastal towns. On the evening of 15 December, the fleet came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced the German fleet commander, VAdm Friedrich von Ingenohl, that the entire Grand Fleet was deployed before him. Under orders from Wilhelm II to avoid battle if victory was not certain, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battlefleet back towards Germany.
In February 1916, the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) decided that the pre-dreadnoughts were no longer effective warships in the face of more modern vessels, and so the ships of II Squadron were gradually removed from the High Seas Fleet and reassigned solely to coastal defense duties in the Danish straits and the German Bight. Accordingly, Lothringen was the first vessel of the unit to be withdrawn, on 19 February, to have anti-torpedo nets installed to protect her from submarines in the confined waters of the Danish straits. Additionally, she was in poor condition by that time and required extensive repairs. After these were completed, she returned to service on 14 July and replaced Hessen in the straits in late August.
Lothringen served in a guard ship role in the straits until September 1917, when she was replaced by the battleship . Lothringen proceeded to Wilhelmshaven, where she was decommissioned on 15 September. Over the next month, she was disarmed and converted into a training ship. She began service in this role on 16 October with a reduced crew. In addition to training new crews, she was used to training engine-room personnel. Lothringen remained in service until the end of the war on 11 November 1918. From 17 November to 16 December, she served as a headquarters ship for IV Battle Squadron.
Post-war career
Following the German defeat in World War I, the German Navy was reorganized as the Reichsmarine according to the Treaty of Versailles. The new navy was permitted to retain eight pre-dreadnought battleships for coastal defense under Article 181, two of which would be in reserve. Lothringen was among those ships chosen to remain on active service with the newly reformed Reichsmarine. Like her sister Preussen, Lothringen was converted into a parent ship for F-type minesweepers at the Kriegsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven in 1919; the ship was disarmed and platforms for holding the minesweepers were installed.
Lothringen served in this capacity, carrying fourteen of the F-boats from the 10th Half-Flotilla, until the minesweeping work required by the Treaty of Versailles was completed. On 2 March 1920, the ship was placed in reserve and remained out of service until 24 March 1931, when Reichspräsident (President of the Realm) Paul von Hindenburg issued an order to dispose of Lothringen. She was accordingly stricken from the naval register on 31 March. The Reichsmarine then sold her, minus her armor plating, to ship breakers that year for 269,650 Reichsmarks. Lothringen was subsequently broken up for scrap; the location of her disposal is uncertain. According to naval historian Eric Gröner, Lothringen was scrapped by Blohm & Voss in Hamburg, but the historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert Röhr, and Hans-Otto Steinmetz state that she was broken up in Wilhelmshaven.

Box Office Poison is the title given in popular culture to a trade magazine advertisement taken out on May 4, 1938, in The Hollywood Reporter by the Independent Theatre Owners Association. Penned by the group's president, Harry Brandt, the title of the red-bordered ad was WAKE UP! Hollywood Producers. The ad named several actors "whose box office draw is nil", and added that "Dietrich, too, is poison at the box office" which led to the moniker that it is popularly remembered by.
Content
The full content of the advert:
WAKE UP! HOLLYWOOD PRODUCERS
Practically all of the major studios are burdened with stars—whose public appeal is negligible—receiving tremendous salaries necessitated by contractual obligations. Having these stars under contract, and paying them sizeable sums weekly, the studios find themselves in the unhappy position to having put these box office deterrents in expensive pictures in the hope that some return on the investment might be had.
This condition is not only burdensome to the studios and its stockholders but is likewise no boon to exhibitors who in the final analysis, suffer by the non-drawing power of these players. Among these players, whose dramatic ability is unquestioned, but whose box office draw is nil, can be numbered Mae West, Edward Arnold, Garbo, Joan Crawford, Katharine Hepburn, and many, many others. Garbo, for instance, is a tremendous draw for Europe, which does not help theater owners in the United States. Hepburn turned in excellent performances in Stage Door and Bringing Up Baby, but both pictures died.
The combined salaries of these stars take millions out of the industry and millions out of the box office. We are not against the star system, mind you, but we don't think it should dominate the production of pictures. We want the Myrna Loys and Gary Coopers and Sonja Henies, but we want them when we get value, not when they drive people away from the box office. And here we meet up with a situation where the exhibitors suffer for the producers' mistakes. Producers know the stars who attract business because there are few producers who do not have theatre affiliates, and those who do not just have to read their percentage contracts to find out which stars bring in the shekels. Yet, so afraid are the studios of losing a star, they tie them up for many years with the result that stars continue to receive top salaries far after their box office rating slides. Kay Francis, for instance, is still receiving many thousands a week from Warners on an old contract. Yet so poor is her draw, she is now making 'B' pictures. Paramount showed cleverness and consideration for exhibitors by buying off Dietrich's contract, which called for one more picture. Dietrich, too, is poison at the box office.
There is no doubt but that stars draw business and when they do they are worth every cent they get. When they do not it is unfair to the industry at large and especially the exhibitor for a studio to continue paying them top salaries and putting them in top bracket pictures. From recent producer statements, it would seem they are just about getting around to that idea. The success of the Jones Family pictures, the Mr. Motos and the Charlie Chans, as well as the Judge Hardy pictures and others is a straw in the wind. Producers are now, or soon will be, concentrating on the making of good pictures, not merely surrounding a $5,000-a-week star with any sort of vehicle.
Sound judgment and good business sense are valuable assets in an industry that is far from being an art.
— Independent Theatre Owners Association
Response
Articles appeared in many US newspapers chronicling the uproar in Hollywood after the association published the ad. Time magazine later that May published responses from some of the stars:
Louella Parsons included a mention of the Brandt ad in her 1938 New Year's Eve summation of the year in entertainment. When Hepburn's The Philadelphia Story opened at Radio City Music Hall to large crowds in December 1940, Brandt sent a telegram to Katharine Hepburn that stated "Come on back, Katie. All is forgiven."
Legacy
The term "box office poison" continues in use in magazine articles and opinion pieces. Over the years, several more "Box Office Poison" lists have been submitted in newspapers, in magazines, or more recently, online. In 1949, Mary Armitage's Film Close-Ups newspaper labeled many stars as "poison" at the box office, among them Sylvia Sidney, James Cagney, Henry Fonda, Ingrid Bergman, Jennifer Jones, John Hodiak, and two actresses that in 1938 were said to have "deserved" their salaries, Bette Davis and Shirley Temple. A BBC article about Hepburn and The Philadelphia Story, written in 2021, still refers to her being labeled in 1938 by Brandt as "box office poison". Brandt's 1972 obituary in The New York Times did not mention his involvement in the creation of the term.

Dorothea Mitchell (1877–1976), also known as Lady Lumberjack, was a pioneer filmmaker in Canada. Mitchell co-founded the first amateur film group in Canada, the Port Arthur Amateur Cinema Society, in 1929, and made three feature-length films: A Race For Ties (1929), Sleep Inn Beauty (1929), and The Fatal Flower (1930 but left unfinished). The society's first film, A Race For Ties, has the distinction of being the first amateur feature length film in Canada.
Mitchell was also the first single woman granted a homestead in the province of Ontario in 1911, served as station master at Silver Mountain Station, and ran a sawmill, which earned her her nickname. She published an autobiography, Lady Lumberjack, in 1968. Lady Lumberjack and other works written by Mitchell were republished in an annotated collection in 2005.
Early life
Dorothea Mitchell was born in England in 1877. The family, including her younger sister Vera, moved from England to Bombay (now Mumbai), India, for her father's work in establishing railroads throughout the British Empire. Dorothea and Vera were educated as colonial elite in India and were taught etiquette and dancing, as well as other pursuits. Mitchell's mother also encouraged her daughters to learn some traditionally masculine skills as well, such as carpentry, riding, and marksmanship. Shortly after the family returned to England in the 1890s, Dorothea's father died. The family's upper class status in India reverted to middle class in England, and Dorothea began working various jobs to support her mother and younger sister.
Biography
Mitchell emigrated to Canada on her own in 1904 for employment opportunities, first landing in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She worked various jobs, among them teaching dancing and swimming lessons, while waiting for her mother and sister to join her in Hamilton, Ontario, part of the Greater Toronto Area. When illness delayed her mother and sister's arrival to Canada, Mitchell left Hamilton to work for a mining engineer in Silver Mountain, Ontario, in 1909. Although the job's tenure was brief due to the economic decline in the silver mining industry, Mitchell remained in the region and began working for the Canadian National Railway (CNR) as a station master, and also operated the general store. Realizing the value of lumber, Mitchell purchased a sawmill and hired workers, earning her nickname of "Lady Lumberjack". The nickname is suitable for Mitchell according to those who knew her; they describe her as proper and ladylike, yet independent and fearless at the same time. For example, when cheated out of $130 in her sawmill business, she single-handedly took the perpetrator to court and won, eventually using the story of a crooked timber dealer as inspiration when writing her first film, A Race For Ties.
Unmarried women were not ordinarily entitled to a free grant, but Mitchell was granted homestead in 1907, although she was permitted only 79 acres, less than half of what men were typically given. She was the first single woman granted homestead in the province of Ontario. Mitchell lived in a bungalow on the property with her mother and sister, who had finally arrived to Canada from England.
Mitchell remained spirited and determined in her various interests throughout her life. In her autobiography, she recounts her foray into photography, stating "After I traded an old cook stove for a camera, I became renowned for my photography instead of my dresses." Her interest in film, as well as various other endeavours including writing, assisted her later in her filmmaking.
Film career
Mitchell moved to Port Arthur, Ontario (now part of Thunder Bay) in 1921, joining her mother and sister, who had moved there the previous year. Again, Mitchell worked various jobs such as teacher and accountant, through which she met Fred Cooper, a local bakery owner. Mitchell's local reputation as a proficient photographer and ardent writer (involved in local newspapers and theatres) made her a perfect partner for the aspiring filmmaker Cooper, and together they co-founded the Port Arthur Amateur Cinema Society (PAACS) in February 1929. The society has the distinction of being the first amateur film group in Canada, and their first film, A Race For Ties, is the first Canadian feature-length film by non-professionals.
A Race For Ties (1929)
Mitchell put her varied experiences to use, serving as actor, production manager, editor, casting director, and writer for A Race For Ties. As writer, Mitchell was inspired by her own experiences, telling a story of a small sawmill owner competing against a large timber company to win a railway tie contract. In her autobiography, Lady Lumberjack, Mitchell recounts her involvement with the Cinema Society, stating "[A Race For Ties] was based on a timber deal I had myself experienced in the adjacent bush country, but of course making a young girl the heroine. As the author, I was privileged to choose the cast, and, with the Photographer and Director, became a charter member of the Amateur Cinema Society of Thunder Bay."
The film debuted at Thunder Bay's Lyceum Theatre in May 1929. The three-night event was incredibly popular. Some four hundred people had to be turned away because maximum capacity had been reached. Mitchell recalls the event as "a truly posh affair. Expressions of opinion were quite complimentary, perhaps the most extravagant coming from the manager of our biggest local movie house, the Colonial. He said our effort was definitely ahead of many of the early professional productions." The PAACS also showed their newsreel at the event. Although films in the 1920s were usually accompanied by introductory newsreels, the PAACS newsreel was the first to include the news of local Northwestern Ontario events, as well as national and international events.
Sleep Inn Beauty (1929) and The Fatal Flower (1930)
The PAACS's second feature-length film, Sleep Inn Beauty, was again produced, cast, and written by Mitchell, who adapted the scenario from a short story. In her autobiography, she recounts how the success of the first two films encouraged the PAACS to expand, renting an office and more equipment. However, in 1931 the Society was forced to close due to dwindling interest from members and accumulated bank debt from the filming of the uncompleted The Fatal Flower. The onset of the Great Depression, as well as the introduction of sound film to cinema, also contributed to the Society's closure.
The Fatal Flower Project (2004)
In 2004, a small group of film historians, filmmakers, writers, and artists in Thunder Bay endeavoured to finish Mitchell's last film, The Fatal Flower. Led by local filmmaker Kelly Saxberg, the members of "The Fatal Flower Project" became familiar with Mitchell through archival footage, as well as her autobiography and previous films, and proceeded to finish the silent film, editing the raw footage and adding a plot, inter-title cards, and accompanying music. The film previewed at Thunder Bay's historic Finnish Labour Temple.
Later life
In 1930, Mitchell became the first secretary-treasurer for the new Port Arthur General Hospital. After the closure of the Port Arthur Amateur Cinema Society in 1931, Mitchell's mother and sister died and Mitchell, although no longer having to support her dependents, took over a real estate and accounting business in Port Arthur. Mitchell was also involved in St. John's Anglican Church and the Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire in Port Arthur. In 1939, at the age of 63, Mitchell enlisted in the Red Cross Society and worked in the transportation corps and the office of Voluntary Registration of Canadian women at the onset of World War II. She continued working for the military, helping the dependents of servicemen as well as aiding British orphans until she retired to the West Coast in 1941, settling down in Victoria, British Columbia. In Victoria, she became involved once again in amateur filmmaking, joining the Victoria Amateur Movie Club, as well as joining the Victoria Branch of the Canadian Authors Association as secretary. In 1968, at the age of 91, Mitchell published a book of autobiographical short stories, entitled Lady Lumberjack. Mitchell died in Victoria in 1976, at the age of 99.
Legacy
The Silver Mountain and Area Historical Society is working towards designating a portion of Highway 593 as the Dorothea Mitchell Memorial Highway.
In her review of Lady Lumberjack, the annotated collection of works edited by Michel S. Beaulieu and Ronald N. Harpelle, Cheryl Desroches states of Mitchell: "If she found living in the woods at times inconvenient, she would have laughed at the thought of herself as soft. Lady Lumberjack is laden with evidence of Mitchell's ability to defy notions, typical of the era, of appropriate female behaviour. [...] Mitchell's experiences fostered a strong belief that women were capable of anything men could do." The anthology "provide[s] a much-needed first-hand female perspective of the pioneer experience. Because she wrote about her extraordinary life in such matter-of-fact terms, however, her contributions to the feminist movement (and to literature more generally) has been overlooked in the broader historical record." Desroches praises Beaulieu and Harpelle's efforts to include Mitchell with the likes of Susanna Moodie and Catherine Parr Traill as an early advocate of women's rights.

San Antonio Mountain is a free-standing volcanic peak in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. With an elevation of 10,908 feet, San Antonio Mountain is the highest peak within the Taos Plateau volcanic field, the largest volcanic field within the Rio Grande Rift valley.
The mountain lies just outside a northwest boundary of the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument. It lies within the Carson National Forest and is administered by the U.S. Forest Service rather than the Bureau of Land Management.
It is called "Bear Mountain" by Tewa-speaking peoples in the Rio Grande valley, and is known as the mountain of the north in their cosmology.
Geography
San Antonio Mountain is one of several volcanic peaks within the 7000 square kilometer Taos Plateau volcanic field, a region of volcanic activity within the Rio Grande rift valley. Other nearby peaks include Ute Mountain (10,082 feet), Cerro de la Olla (9,475 feet), Cerro del Aire (9,023 feet), and Cerro Montoso (8,655 feet). San Antonio Mountain is both the highest peak in the region and possesses the greatest relief, but it is shorter than the highest peaks in the surrounding ranges: Grouse Mesa (11,403 feet) in the Tusas Mountains to the west, and Wheeler Peak (13,161 feet) in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the east. However, because it stands alone, San Antonio Mountain is a distinctive feature that can be seen from as far as 60 or more miles away in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico.
San Antonio Mountain has a base diameter of five miles, and rises dramatically from the surrounding sagebrush plains of the lower San Luis Valley.
Forest Road 418 goes to the top, where there are radio and television towers. However it may not be open to motorized travel by the general public, as there is a locked gate where the road crosses private property. Hikers may walk around the private property.
Geology
The mountain is a dacite dome, built up of lava high in silica and mildly elevated in alkali metal oxides that erupted between 3.36 and 2.9 million years ago. Most of the mountain consists of dacite flows up to thick. These are glassy at their bases, massive and grey in their center sections, and blocky on the upper surfaces. These are sometimes oxidized to a red color. The mountain has north and south summits separated by a shallow saddle, with cinder and spatter around the southern summit that shows this was the youngest vent area. The mountain almost buries a slightly older and much smaller andesite cone to the northwest.
Flora and fauna
The mountain features Gambel oak and ponderosa pine, with Douglas fir, Engelmann spruce, and quaking aspens at higher elevations.
San Antonio Mountain is an important winter habitat for migrating herds of elk, and hosts one of the largest populations of elk in New Mexico, estimated at 7,000 individuals. The mountain and its surroundings also provide habitat for pronghorn, golden eagle, hawks, bears, mountain lions, mule deer and white-tailed jackrabbits among other smaller mammals. In the fall, the Stuart Meadows wetlands on the nearby Rio San Antonio provide a stopover for migrating Sandhill cranes, mallards, American wigeon, Northern pintail, common yellowthroat, and sora.

Cyclophora punctaria, the maiden's blush, is a moth of the family Geometridae. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. The species is mainly prevalent in Central and Eastern Europe. In the north, its distribution extends to southern Fennoscandia and the British Isles, in the west via France to parts of northern Spain, in the south via Italy, the Balkan Peninsula (with the exception of Greece) to Asia Minor. The eastern border of the distribution is roughly the Ural. In the Caucasus area, the nominate subspecies is replaced by the subspecies C. punctaria fritzae. The range of this subspecies extends as far as Iran.Cyclophora punctaria is found mainly in wooded areas with oak scrub and oak forests. In Central Europe it rises up to 700 metres in the hills, rarely up to 1,200 metres in the Alps, and regularly rises to 1,300 metres in southern Europe.
Description
The wingspan is 13–25 mm for the first generation; the second generation is typically much smaller and reaches only about 22 mm. The forewings have sand ground colour, or may have reddish or yellowish tints. The pattern is variable. The medium-sized, slightly curved and brown coloured cross line is always clearly marked. Basal to this there is strongly curved row of dots. Distally is a slightly curved row of dots. A further line dots is the margin. The fringes are the basic colour. The pattern elements continue on the hindwings. The discal marks are the base colour and therefore hardly visible. The larva is smooth and slim, very variable in colour, green, brown or grey. On the sides there are red and yellowish-white spots framed by yellow oblique lines, on the dorsum they have a variety of U-shaped black spots.The pupa, which is quite is yellowish-brown to greenish with four rows of large, dark back spots. At the cremaster sit six strong bristles.
Biology
The moths fly in generations from May to June and in August in western Europe.
The larvae feed on oak leaves.

Crossyne is a genus of African plants in the Amaryllis family.
Taxonomy and features
There are two known species, both of which are native to Cape Province in South Africa:
Crossyne Salisb., Gen. Pl.: 116 (1866).
Crossyne flava (W.F.Barker ex Snijman) D.Müll.-Doblies & U.Müll.
Crossyne guttata (L.) D.Müll.-Doblies & U.Müll.-Doblies, Feddes Repert. 105: 358 (1994)
After being included in the genus Boophone for many decades, Crossyne was raised to genus status in the 1990s, most conspicuously on the basis that:
Crossyne leaves undergo the following characteristic metamorphosis, the seedling starting from paired, small, lorate leaves growing more or less erect among competing low vegetation. From the age of some four to six years however, the bulbs become large enough to produce broad, flat, prostrate leaves that compete well for space by growing over small neighbours. In this they differ from Boophone species, that grow more erectly, with distichous leaves.
The leaf margins of Crossyne are completely fringed with straight short bristles, typically 1 cm or so in length, in one or more rows; Boophone leaves are completely glabrous.
In both genera the bulb commonly grows to a mass of well over a kilogram, but the bulbs of Crossyne do not extend above ground at all unless because of erosion or similar factors, whereas Boophone bulbs tend to project perhaps halfway above the ground, depending on circumstances.
General biology
If not disturbed, which in the wild they seldom are, being dangerously poisonous, the bulbs grow for decades at least. As the bulb grows larger it produces more leaves, some six or eight in a season when mature. The leaves grow in a radial arrangement around the top of the bulb, emerging from a flat slit. The leaves are a decorative dark green, coriaceous in texture and mottled or spotted beneath, especially near the base. The margins of the leaves of all ages are elegantly ciliate, being fringed with eyelash-like bristles. The plant is strictly deciduous and endemic to a mainly winter-rainfall, partly semi-arid, region; the leaves emerging near the time of the first rains, about when the plant sheds the infructescence. The leaves dry out, curl up somewhat and detach towards late springtime or mid-summer, leaving little sign of the whereabouts of the dormant, buried bulb. If torn, whether live or as yet undecayed, the leaves dried sap forms silky threads that in past times cattle herders used to apply to bleeding cuts as a styptic.

Garissa () is the capital of Garissa County, Kenya. It is situated in the former North Eastern Province.
Geography
The Tana River, which rises in Mount Kenya east of Nyeri, flows through the Garissa. The Bour-Algi Giraffe Sanctuary, situated 5 km south of Garissa, is home to endangered wildlife including the Rothschild giraffe, gerenuk and other herbivores including Kirk's dik-dik, lesser kudu, warthog and waterbuck.
Demographics
The town recorded a population of 119,696 in the 2009 census, which rose to 163,399 in 2019. Most of Garissa's inhabitants are ethnic Somali.
Economy
Garissa is a market centre and the commercial hub of the Garissa County. The town has a university, Garissa University College and a number of colleges including Medical College. In December 2019, the Garissa Solar Power Station was inaugurated, providing grid power to Garissa town.
Banks with a presence in Garissa include the Gulf African Bank situated in the Al-Wayf Quran House, the Postbank in the Garissa Shopping Centre, and the First Community Bank (FCB) in the Bajwed Building. Other banks with branches in the city include Absa Bank, Equity Bank, Kenya Commercial Bank, National Bank of Kenya, Chase Bank and Cooperative Bank of Kenya.
Livestock production is a significant part of the town's economy. Between 2005 and 2007, Garissa cattle producers earned over 1.8 billion shillings in sales in domestic and overseas markets. Construction on a new abattoir also began in October 2007. In terms of livestock imports, most of Garissa's cattle comes from cross-border trade between Somali livestock merchants.
2015 terrorist attack
On 2 April 2015, gunmen stormed the Garissa University College, killing 147 people and injuring at least 79. The militant group and Al-Qaeda offshoot, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. The gunmen took over 700 students hostage, freeing Muslims and killing those who identified as Christians. The siege ended the same day, when all four of the attackers were killed. Five men were later arrested in connection with the attack, and a bounty was placed for the arrest of a suspected organizer, Mohamed Mahmoud, also known as Dulyadeyn. Dulyadeyn was later killed by U.S.-trained Somali commandos from the Somali National Army on the night of May 31, 2016 in Bulo Gadud, a town loyal to Al-Shabaab, about 30 kilometers north of the port of Kismayo in Somalia.
The Garissa University attack was the second deadliest terrorist attack in Kenyan history since independence (after the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Nairobi, in which 213 people were killed).
Governance
As the capital of Garissa County, Garissa is the seat of the County Government of Garissa as well as the County Assembly. The Governor of the county is Ali Bunow Korane. The city is represented by Aden Bare Duale, a Somali Member of Parliament for the Garissa Township Constituency in the National Assembly of Kenya. He was elected to the position in the Kenya National Assembly through the United Republican Party, an affiliate party of the Jubilee Alliance. He currently serves as the Majority Leader in the Parliament. During the colonial era, Garissa, as well as other parts of NFD, were collectively conferred to as the British East Africa province of Trans-juba, and would subsequently be referred to as Jubaland, which split into two in the mid 1920s.
Accommodation
Several establishments in the city offer accommodation. Among these hotels and guest houses are the Almond Hotel, Xiddig Hotel and Nomad Palace Hotel.
Climate
Garissa has a hot arid climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), despite receiving around of rainfall per year, due to the extremely high potential evapotranspiration. Garissa's landscape is mostly arid, desert terrain. The city lies along the Tana River, and has a hot climate due to the low elevation and distance from cooler coastal areas. The daytime temperature typically rises above every day, but cools down every night.

Sue Bell Cobb (born March 1, 1956) is an American jurist and former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, the first woman to hold that office in Alabama's history. In 2018 she unsuccessfully ran for governor of Alabama losing in the primary to Tuscaloosa mayor Walt Maddox receiving 30 percent of the vote compared to his 52 percent.
Early life and career
Cobb was born in Louisville, Kentucky. She graduated from Sparta Academy and the University of Alabama with a degree in history. She received the Phi Alpha Theta Scholarship Key. Cobb attended the University of Alabama School of Law, graduating with a J.D. in 1981. In law school Cobb was a member of the Bench and Bar Honor Society, Farrah Law Society, and Moot Court Board. Cobb is married to William J. Cobb, Executive Director of Governmental Affairs of Bell South (retired). They have three children and four grandchildren.
Cobb was appointed as a judge of Conecuh County District Court immediately after being admitted to the bar. Formerly one of the state's youngest judges, she was elected to the district court in 1982 and re-elected in 1988.
As a trial judge, Cobb took assignments from about 40 counties. In 1997, Cobb was appointed by the Alabama Supreme Court to serve as the Alternate Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary.
In 2004, Cobb served as an appellate court judge during the appeals case of :Anthony Ray Hinton for his 1985 murder conviction. Though Hinton's 2004 appeal was denied at the time, Cobb was one of the presiding judges that thought he deserved a new trial. Cobb noted "I had never been so convinced of someone's innocence than I had in Mr. Hinton's case after reviewing all of the evidence", elaborating that "there were no fingerprints. ... When you looked at the ballistics expert that the defense had hired, he was woefully inadequate." Hinton's conviction was eventually overturned and he was freed after 30 years in prison on April 3, 2015.
Chief Justice
Campaign and election
Cobb served as Alabama's Chief Justice from 2007 until her resignation in August 2011. She was the first woman elected to this post and had previously served from 1995 to 2007 as a judge on the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, the state court for criminal intermediate appeals. Before 1995, she had served as a trial judge in state district court for many years.
Cobb, a Democrat, was the only member of her party to serve on the Alabama Supreme Court at that time. Elected in 2006, she unseated Judge Drayton Nabers Jr., a Republican who in 2003 had succeeded Justice Roy Moore after Moore had been removed from the bench regarding his role in the display of the Ten Commandments in the courthouse. The race achieved notoriety for its cost; including the primary, the candidates raised over $8.3 million.
Rulings
On November 2, The Alabama Supreme Court, in an 8–1 vote, struck down a 2003 circuit court ruling that ExxonMobil Corp owed the state $3.6 billion in punitive damages. All eight Republican associate justices agreed that evidence in the case did not support a finding of fraud. Democratic Chief Justice Sue Bell Cobb dissented. She maintains that corporate greed should not outweigh the interests of the people of Alabama.
Accomplishments
Juvenile justice reform
Cobb was a critical champion and contributor to the passage of the 2008 Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2008. Following passage of the bill, Juvenile crime decreased and number of imprisoned children was reduced by more than 60%.
Retirement
Cobb announced her intention to retire from office on June 30, 2011, to devote more time to her family. Cobb noted that she had also been wary of "the cost of running for office while maintaining judicial objectivity". She denied that her decision to step down was connected with a potential bid for Governor of Alabama in the 2014 election, She considered it, but ultimately decided against running. After stepping down, she became "a national advocate for changing how judges are selected", saying on her race against Nabers (said to be the second most expensive judicial race in American history), "Everything we did was legal and ethical, but that didn't mean it was right". In 2015, in an op-ed piece for Politico, she said she was ashamed of the amount of money she had to raise to win the election.
Candidate for Governor
On June 14, 2017, Cobb announced her candidacy for governor, declaring "I simply cannot stand by and watch as one more community hospital closes its doors. I cannot be still as so many bad decisions that affect us all continue to be made. As the head of Alabama's judicial branch, and in the face of significant obstacles, I was able to work with amazing court leaders and state employees to make vast improvements in the lives of others. If given the opportunity, I would be honored to put my experience and skill set to work in the executive branch. I promise, I will work and I will not stop until there is light again on Alabama's horizon."

MiG-29M Super Fulcrum is a sequel to the game MiG-29 Fulcrum.
Reception
John S. Davison for Page 6 said "I found it quite enjoyable [...] but [...] I consider it a beginner's flight simulator, rather than one for the expert flightsim fan."
Colin Campbell for Amiga Power said "For the technically minded flight simer this [...] could prove a very good buy. The trouble is, it isn't a game that's been designed to be fun per se, and while many people will love it I suspect that some, attracted by the subject rather than the software, will be in for a rather confusing time."
Andy Hutchinson for PC Format said "Graphically and technically, the game is excellent. The neatly designed campaign element will satisfy strategy fans, while the instant death merchant will enjoy the ability to zip straight into the heart of a dogfight. Immense fun."
Ocean Power said "MiG-29 Super Fulcrum doesn't just offer the keen flight sim enthusiast a chance to experience the delights of an exotic and unusual fighter plane, it's also a fine flight simulation program in its own right. A must for flight 'n' fight fans."
Paul Rigby for Computer Games Strategy Plus said "An enthusiast with cash to spare might find Super Fulcrum worth a look for its technical achievements. But look elsewhere if you're watching the pennies and cents."
Kati Hamza for The One for ST Games said "there's nothing else quite like it: it's nice to see a politically neutral flight sim for once and if you're after a technically impressive flying experience Soviet-style, MiG 29M is hard to beat."
David Wilson for Zero said "If you loved the first game [...] or if it's the notion of flying MiGs that really turns you on, this version is radically improved in the playability stakes and also offers a whole new scenario."
Sam Greenhill for Acorn User said "Despite the odd improvement, we have taken a step backwards. Super Fulcrum contains only one, albeit very large, mission and thus lacks the welcome diversity offered by Fulcrum."

Presenting Thad Jones/Mel Lewis & The Jazz Orchestra is a 1966 big band jazz album recorded by the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra and released on the Solid State Records label. It is the debut release by the orchestra (although an earlier live session recording would eventually be released as Opening Night). All tracks are also included on Mosaic's limited edition boxed set, The Complete Solid State Recordings of the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra.
The track titled "Three in One" is incorrectly labeled on the album cover. The correct title of the piece is "Three and One." The piece was originally written by Jones for a 1958 small group session titled "Keepin' Up With The Joneses" with Thad, his two siblings (Hank on piano and Elvin on drums), and bass player Eddie Jones (no relation). The title refers to the three Jones siblings plus one other Jones who is unrelated. The correct title is on the original parts as well as the later published version by Kendor.

Frank O'Connor (April 11, 1881 – November 22, 1959) was an American character actor and director, whose career spanned five decades and included appearances in over 600 films and television shows. Early in his career he was also billed as Frank A. Connor and Frank L.A. O'Connor. During the silent film era, he directed or was the assistant director on numerous films; he also penned several screenplays in both the silent and sound film eras. He is sometimes erroneously identified with the Frank O'Connor who was married to author Ayn Rand.
Life and career
Born on April 11, 1881, in New York City, O'Connor would begin his film career with a starring role in the 1915 silent film, The Voice in the Fog, which also starred Donald Brian and Adda Gleason. He starred or had featured roles in six more films between 1917 and 1920, before focusing on work behind the camera. During the remainder of the silent film era, he would write and/or direct over two dozen films, May McAvoy (several films, including Everything for Sale, 1921), Ralph Lewis (several films, including One of the Bravest, 1925), Clara Bow (several films, including Free To Love, 1925), Owen Moore (Go Straight, 1925), Jean Arthur (The Block Signal, 1926, which O'Connor also wrote), Gayne Whitman (Exclusive Rights, 1926), Wanda Hawley (Hearts and Spangles, 1926), Madge Bellamy (Colleen, 1927), Phyllis Haver (Your Wife and Mine, 1927), and Betty Compson (Masked Angel, 1928). He also wrote four screenplays for silent films during the 1920s.
With the advent of sound in films, O'Connor would once again move in front of the camera. After 1930 he would only direct 2 sound films, The Call of the Circus in 1930, starring Francis X. Bushman, and 1939's The Mystic Circle Murder, which starred Robert Fiske and Betty Compson, and which O'Connor also wrote. He would write the story for Sailor Be Good (1933), directed by James Cruze and starring Jack Oakie, as well as Adventure in Diamonds, directed by George Fitzmaurice and starring George Brent and Isa Miranda.
From 1930 right up to the year of his death in 1959, O'Connor would appear in over 600 films, serials, shorts, and television shows, mostly in small roles. Some of the more notable films he appeared in include: the original King Kong (1933), starring Fay Wray, as well as its sequel, The Son of Kong, also in 1933; 1935's The Little Colonel, starring Shirley Temple and Lionel Barrymore; John Ford's The Whole Town's Talking, starring Edward G. Robinson and Jean Arthur; the 1937 version of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; Frank Capra's classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, again with Jean Arthur, also starring James Stewart and Claude Rains; John Ford's classic The Grapes of Wrath, adapted from the novel of the same name by John Steinbeck, and starring Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell; the iconic Citizen Kane, directed by and starring Orson Welles; Cover Girl (1944) starring Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly; Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1947), starring Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed; the 1950 John Wayne vehicle, Sands of Iwo Jima (1950); Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd. (1950), starring William Holden and Gloria Swanson; and the 1955 version of My Sister Eileen starring Janet Leigh, Jack Lemmon, and Betty Garrett. One of his final big screen performances would be in another small role in 1957's Jet Pilot, starring John Wayne and Janet Leigh. In addition to his feature film work, O'Connor would appear in several serials, including G-Men Never Forget in 1948, Superman in 1948, Ghost of Zorro (1949), Batman and Robin (1949), King of the Rocket Men (1949), The Invisible Monster (1950), Atom Man vs. Superman (1950), and Captain Video: Master of the Stratosphere (1951).
With the advent of television, O'Connor would make numerous appearances on the small screen. His first appearance was in a 1952 episode of Racket Squad. Other series on which he appeared include: Dragnet, Adventures of Superman, and Perry Mason. His final performance would be on a 1959 episode of M Squad, which aired on April 17, shortly before his death.
O'Connor died on November 22, 1959, at the age of 77, in Los Angeles, California.

HSU First Street Gallery (later known as the HSU Third Street Gallery) was a contemporary, fine arts gallery located in the E. Janssen Building at 422 1st Street (later moved to 416 3rd Street) in the historic Old Town district of Eureka, California. The gallery, which supported the Exhibition Programs of Humboldt State University, was an off-campus, non-profit student-oriented public outreach program and gallery which showcased regional, national and international artists, as well as art by faculty, staff, students, and alumni of the university.
In September 2018, the university closed the gallery during a round of budget cuts.
Mission
First Street Gallery was charged with the mission of providing the North Coast community of California and the community of Humboldt State University with access to contemporary art by regional, national and international artists, as well as providing a visiting artists program. Within the gallery, HSU students prepared, installed, managed and curated the exhibitions. The students worked in conjunction with HSU's Museum and Gallery Practices program through the HSU Art Department, while emphasizing the importance of environmentally conscious practices. Additionally, the students in HSU's Art Education program utilized the exhibitions as a resource for their curriculum while working with local K-12 students. The First Street Gallery stated that its goal was to create a dialogue about important contemporary cultural issues with the community. With an emphasis on encouraging and facilitating local interest in the arts, HSU First Street Gallery had, from 1998 to 2018, produced numerous exhibitions of contemporary art in a wide array of art forms.
History
First Street Gallery was founded in 1998 by Humboldt State University. The gallery received over 20,000 visitors a year.
Programs
First Street Gallery was a learning environment for students from the Museum and Gallery Practices Program.
The HSU Art Education Program used the First Street Gallery as a service learning site for teaching local K-12 students.
First Street Gallery brought national and international artists to HSU through the Visiting Artists Program, with the stated purpose of providing to California's North Coast, an expanded, in-depth exposure to new art forms that would otherwise be unavailable to the local population.
Events
On the first Saturday of every month the First Street Gallery participated in the local arts promotion event of Arts Alive!, in which Eureka's galleries and museums are open to the public new exhibitions, shows, theater and musical performances. During this event, First Street Gallery hosted an opening reception for its current exhibitions. This presented an opportunity for the public to meet with the artists exhibiting at the gallery.

Atarfe is a Spanish city in the north central part of the Vega of Granada in the province of Granada, Andalusia. It borders the municipalities of Moclín, Colomera, Albolote, Maracena, Granada, Santa Fe, and Pinos Puente. By this village run the Rivers Cubillas and Colomera. Its districts include Caparacena, Sierra Elvira, Hurpe and Cubillas.
History
The Granada dictionary of toponyms by Amador Diaz Garcia and Manuel Barrios Aguilera says that its name comes from the Arabic al-Taraf, which in Granada would be a-tarf dialect, meaning strut, probably related to its Castillejo and Colorao peaks.
This view is also shared by the linguist Jesus Martinez del Castillo. Other views situate its origin in the artarf Arabic word which means limit, as it was the limit in the vicinity of the city of Elvira. There seems to be, as some have thought, a Moorish dynasty Tarfe, a close relative of the kings of Granada. The first civilizations that settled into the soil date from the Neolithic, Iberian and Roman close to them, under whose domination Ilíberis city was founded in the foothills of Sierra Elvira. During the Caliphate, the city was renamed Elvira, and achieved great splendor as the capital of the Cora, one of the most important of Al-Andalus.
The decisive Battle of Higueruela between the troops of Juan II and King Muhammed IX of Granada took place a short distance from the city center of the village, precisely in the annex of Sierra Elvira. In July 1486, during the Battle of the Acequia Gorda, where died Martin Vazquez de Arce, better known as the Doncel Siguenza. It definitively became a Castilian power after the battle.) At the church, in around 1570, the Moors of Albolote, Atarfe, Armilla, Belicena and Pinos Puente, met in order to be ken to Castile.

Monuments
Church of the Incarnation. Erected as a copy of the Metropolitan Church of Granada promoted in 1501, stands on the place where the old mosque Xini was, as published in the Book of Hábices. In 1617 it consisted of a single nave, which still maintains its coffered ceiling tracery conducted by Antonio Bermudez and Christopher Calvo, from the Granada school.
By 1642, three ships midpoint were built, with triumphal arches, made of brick and masonry, like the three gates. Inside there are 12 frames of the Granada Baroque school, called " apostolada series "which can be dated from 1700. Also dated from this year are the tabernacle and pulpit, the latter topped with a sculpture of the Faith.
Santa Ana hermitage. St. Of the town. The chapel is located in what was the Convent of the Order of St. Paul of the Cross, northwest from downtown. After the abandonment of the Convent , the area became the municipal cemetery and once it moved to its current location, the convent chapel became the patron saint, Santa Ana.
Monument to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in front of the Chapel of Santa Ana, made of stone from Sierra Elvira, by a local sculptor from Granada, Antonio Cano Correa in 1940.
Hermitage of the Three Johns . A local devotee of the Three Johns (Saint John Baptist, Saint John Evangelist and Saint Juan de Dios ), the chapel was erected in the first half of the twentieth century, on the ruins of an old Moorish castle in Cerro del Castillejo. After the death of its creator, construction froze and did not have a religious use. At the end of the century, the town hall finished the work to use it as a civic place, such as a viewing point. The surrounding areas have exotic animals such as peacocks.
Celebrations and festivities
Local celebrations: They are celebrated around July 26, the festivity of Santa Ana, with cultural and recreational activities for adults and children. During these, bullfights are held at the Coliseo Ciudad Atarfe, a covered bullring, one of the few in Spain.
Gastronomy: Although today the local gastronomy has become known in the area, it is worth to mention, quince jelly and pipirrana, products of home slaughter", porridge croutons" and maimones soup of tata Frasquita.
1956 earthquake

Pink Floyd park
Atarfe is known for its music concerts. In 2008, Roger Waters, a former member of the band Pink Floyd, played there, resulting in a public park dedicated to Pink Floyd being created by the council.
Coliseo de Atarfe

Operation Sutton was the code name for the British landings on the shores of San Carlos Water, at Ajax Bay and Port San Carlos, near San Carlos on East Falkland.
Landings
During the night, 3 Commando Brigades along with attached units of the Parachute Regiment were landed from the liner and the LPD . There was very limited enemy resistance on the ground.
The Argentine Army force on site was a section from the 25th Infantry Regiment named Combat Team Güemes (Spanish: Equipo de Combate Güemes), or EC Güemes, located at Fanning Head. After the British fleet was spotted at 02:50, EC Güemes opened fire with 81mm mortars and two 105mm recoilless rifles. The British warships replied with naval gunfire, and a 25-man SBS team also returned fire. During the firefight, two British helicopters, a Sea King and a Gazelle, passed overhead, and the Argentine troops fired at them with machine guns. The Gazelle's pilot, Sergeant Andrew Evans - RM, was hit and fatally injured, but he managed to crash-land the aircraft into the sea. Evans and the other crewman, Sergeant Edward Candlish, were thrown out of the aircraft. Argentine troops shot at them for about 15 minutes as they struggled in the water, ignoring orders from their commanding officer to ceasefire. When the firing ceased, Candlish managed to drag Evans to shore, where he died. Minutes later, a second British Gazelle helicopter, following the same route as the first, was hit by small arms fire from the Argentine platoon and shot down, killing the crew, Lt. Ken Francis and L/Cpl. Pat Giffin.
The Argentinians eventually retreated from Fanning Head, abandoning their communications equipment. At least eight members of another Argentinian platoon who fled the scene were left behind and captured by the British.
Argentine commandos of the 601 Commando Company shot down a GR.3 Harrier on a reconnaissance mission on Port Howard with a Blowpipe missile. The pilot, Flight Lieutenant Glover, bailed out, breaking his arm and collar bone in the process. He was taken prisoner by Argentine soldiers shortly afterward, and flown to a military hospital in Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina. Six Argentine pilots were killed during the operation.
The invasion, part of the overall Operation Corporate, sparked a strong reply from the Argentine Air Force and Argentine Naval Aviation and led to the Battle of San Carlos.

Nordre Aker (Northern Aker) is a borough of the city of Oslo, Norway.
History
This area became part of the city of Oslo in 1948. Before that it was a part of Aker municipality in the former Akershus county.
Demographics and housing
With a population of 52,327 (1 January 2020) Nordre Aker ranks fifth among the boroughs.
Detached housing dominates the western part of the borough. There are also high-rise student blocks at several locations, including Vestgrensa, Sogn, Fjellbirkeland and Kringsjå.
Geography
The borough is north of the city centre, and represents the last major settlement before the northern forested area starts. It is bordered by Marka in the north and east, Vestre Aker in the west, Frogner in the southwest, St. Hanshaugen, Sagene and a small part of Grünerløkka in the south and Bjerke in the east.
The borough consists of several neighborhoods, from west to east: Gaustad, Øvre Blindern, Ullevål Hageby, Sogn, Kringsjå, Nordberg, Korsvoll, Tåsen, Ullevål, Berg, Nydalen, Storo, Frysja, Disen, Kjelsås, Grefsen and Nordre Åsen.
The major body of water in the borough is the river Akerselva. The western border of the borough is formed by a creek, Sognsvannsbekken. The lake Sognsvann is not located in Nordre Aker, albeit the parking lot and metro leading to it is.
Transportation
The area is well covered with public transportation. Part of the Sognsvann Line of the Oslo Metro is in Nordre Aker, exactly beginning at the station Blindern in the south to the terminus Sognsvann in the north. The line runs northeast from Blindern, but between Berg and Tåsen it turns to the northwest and north. At the station Forskningsparken the Sognsvann Line overpasses the light rail Ullevål Hageby Line, which comes from the southeast. The terminus of this line being John Colletts plass for many years, it was extended to Rikshospitalet in 1999.
Branching off from the Sognsvann Line between Ullevål stadion and Berg since 2006 is the Ring Line of the Metro. The Ring Line stops at Nydalen before heading southwards and converging with the borough border towards St. Hanshaugen. The station Storo is on the border between the boroughs. Storo is also a light rail station; the terminus of the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line and the start of the Kjelsås Line. Opened in 1934, the Kjelsås Line runs northwards towards the terminus at Kjelsås. Lastly, Kjelsås is also a station on the Gjøvik Line railway, so is Nydalen. The Gjøvik Line runs from Storo via Akerselva towards Kjelsås, and northwards into Marka.
Road transport is also important in the borough. The largest ring road in the city, Ring 3, cuts through Nordre Aker. The portion of Ring 3 located in Nordre Aker starts, in the west, exactly at the underpass of Gaustadalléen under Ring 3 (at Gaustadalléen station), and ends in the east at the Sinsen Interchange. It runs eastward until after Nydalen, when it turns steeply to the south. The road it crosses at the Sinsen Interchange is not located in Nordre Aker.
Culture
The local newspaper is Nordre Aker Budstikke. It is distributed freely and weekly. Also, student newspapers such as Universitas are headquartered in the borough; Universitas is also distributed to institutions in other boroughs.
Sports
Nordre Aker is best known as the site of Ullevål Stadion, the stadium of the Norway national football team. Tenants on club level have been Vålerenga Fotball, and FK Lyn before the latter club faced a series of relegations. Vålerenga originally has no connection to Nordre Aker, whereas Lyn origins from the north of the borough, around Kringsjå. Ullevål is traditionally the area of Ullevål IL, and though this club has dropped association football from its programme, it operates the bandy field Bergbanen adjacent to Ullevål Stadion. Other bandy clubs in the borough are Tåsen IL and Skeid Bandy. Skeid Bandy, a part of the multi-sports-club Skeid, has a headquarters at Nordre Åsen, but the club has a geographic connection to Sagene borough. Lyn is also a multi-sports club, SFK Lyn, which in addition to football is involved in Nordic skiing. Other skiing clubs in the borough are IL Koll (which also professes in volleyball), Kjelsås IL (which also professes in football) and Nydalen SK (which also professes in orienteering). Korsvoll IL is best known for football and handball. IK Akerselva is a floorball club competing on the highest national level.
In addition, the students' sports club Oslostudentenes IK (OSI) has a connection to Nordre Aker, as it uses the indoor arena Domus Athletica in Ullevål Hageby, although the club originated in Sentrum in the milieu of the old university campus. Domus Athletica is owned by, and houses the headquarters of, the Foundation for Student Life in Oslo.
Track and field athletics is weak as far as clubs go; Koll, OSI, Lyn and Kjelsås are minor clubs. On the other hand, the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences (see also Education) includes a multi-use indoor arena as well as a red rubber track, tennis fields, ice sports fields, football fields, a bobsleigh training track and more. The facilities at the School of Sports Sciences are used by national and international sportspeople, much because the national Olympic training scheme, Olympiatoppen and the elite sports centre, Toppidrettssenteret are located north of the School of Sports Sciences.
Federations such as the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, the Football Association of Norway and the Norwegian Athletics Association are headquartered in Idrettens Hus at Ullevål Stadion.
Churches and hospitals
The "National Hospital" of Norway, Rikshospitalet, was moved to Gaustad in 2000. Its location is west across the street of Gaustad Hospital, founded in 1855. Gaustad was originally chosen as a location because of the rural seclusion of the time. Inhabitants in the east of Nordre Aker live closer to Aker Hospital, but this hospital is located slightly outside the borough.
In the Church of Norway, Nordre Aker is a deanery whose borders do not correspond with the borough border (they are more widespread). The parishes in the deanery are Torshov, Tonsen, Sofienberg, Paulus, Lilleborg, Sagene, Iladalen and Grefsen.
Education and business
Nordre Aker is the center of higher education in Oslo and therefore Norway, with the main campus of the University of Oslo located at Blindern since the post-war years. In addition, there is a campus for medicine and odontology at Rikshospitalet, and buildings belonging to the University in Forskningsparken ("the Research Park") northwest of Blindern. In addition, the Norwegian School of Management is headquartered in Nydalen since 2005. Near Sognsvann, the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences is located. A newer institution of higher education is the Norwegian College of Acupuncture. Other institutions in the area include the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and the National Archival Services of Norway.
Upper secondary schools in the borough are Blindern and Nydalen. One folk high school, Rønningen Folk High School, is located in the extreme northeast of the borough.
Forskningsparken contains several research-based businesses, but these are located outside of the borough. Major commercial buildings include Sogn Arena, owned by Bertel O. Steen Eiendom. Major shopping malls in the vicinity are Ullevål Stadion Shopping, Tåsen Senter and Storo Storsenter.
Politics
As a borough of Oslo, Nordre Aker is governed by the city council of Oslo (in a parliamentary system) as well as its own borough council. The borough council leader is Bent Gether-Rønning from the Conservative Party, and the deputy leader is Erik Borge Skei of the Liberal Party. The 15 seats are distributed among the following political parties:
1 from the Socialist Left Party (Sosialistisk Folkeparti)
5 from the Labour Party (Arbeiderpartiet)
2 from the Liberal Party (Venstre)
6 from the Conservative Party (Høyre)
1 from the Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet)

The Cabanagem (; 1835–1840) was a popular revolution and pro-separatist movement that occurred in the then province of Grão-Pará, Empire of Brazil.
Among the causes for this revolt were the extreme poverty of the Paraense people, oppression by the Empire of Brazil, and the political irrelevance to which the province was relegated after the independence of Brazil.
The name "Cabanagem" refers to the type of hut used by the poorest people living along the waterways of northern Brazil, principally caboclos, freed slaves, and indigenous people. The elite agriculturists of Grão-Pará, while living much better, resented their lack of participation in the central government's decision-making, which was dominated by the provinces of the Southeast and Northeast.
It is estimated that from 30 to 40% of the population of Grão-Pará, estimated at 100,000 people, died. In 1833 the Province had 119,877 inhabitants, being 32,751 Amerindians and 29,977 black slaves. Mixed-race people were 42,000. The White minority was 15,000, over half of them Portuguese.
Background
During the independence, Grão-Pará mobilized itself to expel reactionary forces which tried to reintegrate Brazil into the Portuguese Empire. Until 1822 Grão-Pará had been a separate viceroyalty from Brazil, reporting itself directly to Portugal; after Brazilian independence Grão-Pará decided to join Brazil. In the independence struggle, which dragged on for several years, the canon and journalist João Batista Gonçalves Campos, the Vinagre brothers and the farmer Félix Clemente Antônio Malcher stood out. Several lodges of fugitive slaves formed, and there were frequent military rebellions. Once the fight for independence ended and a provincial government named by Brazilian Emperor was installed, the local leaders were marginalized from power.
In July 1831 – a few months after the abdication of Emperor Pedro I of Brazil at Rio de Janeiro – a rebellion in the military garrison of Belém do Pará broke out, and Batista Campos was imprisoned as one of the implicated leaders. The indignation of the poor grew, and in 1833 already there was talk of converting Brazil into a federation. The provincial president, Bernardo Lobo de Souza, unleashed a repressive political wave, in an attempt to contain the separatists. The climax was reached in 1834, when Batista Campos published a letter from the Bishop of Pará, Romualdo de Sousa Coelho, criticizing various politicians from the province. For not having permission from the provincial government, Campos was persecuted, and sought refuge on the fazenda of his friend Clemente Malcher. Meeting the Vinagre brothers (Manuel Vinagre, Francisco Pedro Vinagre, and Antônio Vinagre) and the India-rubber collector and journalist Eduardo Angelim they joined a contingent of rebels on Malcher's plantation. Before being attacked by government forces, they abandoned the plantation. Nevertheless, on November 3, troops managed to kill Manuel Vinagre and hold Malcher and other rebels. Batista Campos died on the last day of the year, apparently because of an infection caused by a cut he suffered while shaving.
The movement
On the night of January 6, 1835 the rebels attacked and conquered the city of Belém, assassinating the president Sousa Lobo and the Army Commander, and acquiring a large quantity of munitions. On January 7, Clement Malcher was released and was chosen as president of the province, with Francisco Vinagre as the Army Commander. The government did not last long, because when Malcher, with the support of the upper class, attempted to keep the province united to the Brazilian empire, Francisco Vinagre, Eduardo Angelim, and the other rebels attempted to separate. The break happened when Malcher ordered Angelim taken. Troops on both sides entered the conflict, and the side of Francisco Vinagre was victorious. Clemente Malcher was assassinated, and his body was dragged through the streets of Belém.
Now in the presidency and the Army Command of the Province, Francisco Vinagre was not able to keep his supporters faithful. If it were not for the intervention of his brother Antônio, he would have yielded the government to imperial control, in the person of marshall Manuel Jorge Rodrigues in July 1835. Due to this weakness and the resurgence of a squadron commanded by the English admiral Taylor, the rebel forces were destroyed and retired toward the interior. Reorganizing their forces, they again attacked Belém on August 14. After nine days of battle, and suffering the death of Antônio Vinagre, they retook the capital.
Eduardo Angelim assumed the presidency. For ten months, the elite were alarmed by the rebel control over the province of Grão-Pará. The lack of a plan with concrete means to consolidate the rebel government again provoked a weakness in the ranks. In March 1836, the brigadier José de Sousa Soares Andréia was named president of the province. His first measure was to attack the capital again, which was carried out in April 1836, and as a result of which the rebel group decided to abandon the capital in favor of resistance from the interior.
Naval forces under the command of John Pascoe Grenfell blockaded Belém and, on May 10, Angelim fled from the capital, and was captured and detained. Meanwhile, contrary to what Soares Andréia imagined, the resistance did not end with the detention of Angelim. For three years, the rebels continued to resist from the interior of the province, but were gradually destroyed. The conflict finally ended when amnesty was declared to the rebels, in 1839. In 1840 the last rebel group, under the leadership of Gonçalo Jorge de Magalhães, yielded.
Legacy
It is estimated that during the five years of fighting in the revolt, the population of Pará was reduced from about 100,000 to 60,000.
In homage to the Cabano movement the Memorial da Cabanagem was erected in the entrance to the city of Belém.

Harry Crews was an American, short-lived no wave-influenced hardcore punk and crossover thrash supergroup, made up of Lydia Lunch (guitar), Kim Gordon (bass), and Sadie Mae (drums). The band was only musically active in 1988, and only officially produced and released one album, Naked in Garden Hills. The album was released in 1989 and was a compilation of live recordings played at clubs in London, England, and Austria. Shortly after the release of the album the band split up, due to their involvement in other bands and projects. The band's name was taken after the author of the same name, hence the album's title being taken from a novel by Crews. The majority of the songs were also named after Crews' various novels. They also covered "(She's in A) Bad Mood" (originally by Gordon's band, Sonic Youth), and "Orphans" (originally by Lunch's band Teenage Jesus and the Jerks.)

The Waldorf Playing Fields are three fields adjacent to Matley Lane in Hyde, Tameside.
History
The playing field was donated to the people of the Borough of Hyde for recreation by Newton Mill Ltd. in 1973, but had a covenant restricting their use as a "recreation ground for the use of the residents of Hyde".
The Borough of Hyde was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. In 1986 Tameside became a unitary authority with the abolition of the Greater Manchester County Council.
The fields are currently subject to a dispute regarding their future use. Tameside Council is proposing the sale of two of the fields, subject to the lifting of the covenant. There is a local group campaigning to retain the fields for public use.

Om Namo Narayanaya (Devanagari: ;: IAST: Om Namo Nārāyanāya) , also referred to as the Ashtakshara (eight syllables), and the Narayana Mantra, is among the most popular mantras of Hinduism, and the principal mantra of Vaishnavism. It is an invocation addressed to Narayana, the god of preservation, the form of Vishnu who lays in eternal rest beneath the cosmic waters.
Origin
In the Sama Veda, 'Om Namo Narayanaya' is said to have been taught by Vedic sages to the seekers who came to them for wisdom. It is traditionally believed that this mantra revealed its significance and meaning to these sages through their penances, after which they shared it with seekers as a means of self-realisation.
Literature
Om Namo Narayanaya is heavily featured in Hindu literature, especially in the Upanishads and the Puranas. The mantra is often specified as being invoked by the characters of these scriptures to gain salvation from the deity, and as an instruction to the devotees of Narayana in the performance of rituals.
According to the Tarasara Upanishad, om is the divine sacred syllable that represents the nature of Brahman, the Ultimate Reality that is unchanging and eternal. Namo can be translated from Sanskrit as “to bow to” or “to pay homage to”, as well as refer to an individual's name. Narayanaya is a term that may be translated as "to or of Narayana". Nara refers to “water”, and anaya means “abode” or “shelter.” Narayana is an epithet of Vishnu, whose celestial realm is Vaikuntha, amid the cosmic waters of creation. Hence, it is a mantra that is associated with submission to God, accepting one's existence in the grand design, as well as seeking the protection of Vishnu.
The sage and philosopher Yajnavalkya provides an explanation of the breakdown of the components of the mantra:
In the Vaishnava Upanishads, the Samashti-Yantra, the words described over Ananta, the seat of Vishnu, bear the ashtakshara:
The Narada Purana furnishes the following details regarding the chanting of this mantra:
The Narayana Upanishad also remarks upon the mantra:
The mantra is also often associated with Prahlada, a daitya devotee of Narayana, and the son of Hiranyakashipu. Despite repeated instruction by his overseers to chant the invocation, "Hiranyaya namah" (glory to Hiranya), the devotee sticks to his favoured mantra, "Om Namo Narayanaya Namah" (glory to Narayana).
Historical usage
Periyalvar, a poet-saint of the Alvar tradition, invoked the mantra to convince the Pandya king of Madurai of the supremacy of Vishnu:
Significance
The mantra is held in supreme regard by the Vaishnavas, the adherents of Vishnu who make up the dominant denomination within Hinduism. The religious significance of chanting this incantation is described in the Tarasara Upanishad
The Linga Purana states that chanting the mantra is the means for achieving all objects, and hence must be invoked for every occasion.
In Sri Vaishnavism, the chanting of the mantra was part of the panchasamskaras of Ramanuja, the five sacraments that initiated him into the tradition by his guru, Periyanambi.
According to Vaishnava theology, it is held that whoever studies this ashtakshara of Narayana and recites it constantly attains a full life, supremacy over men, enjoys the pleasures of royalty, and becomes the master of all souls. Whoever chants this mantra is held to attain moksha, according to the teachings of the Sama Veda.

John Theodore McNaughton (November 21, 1921 – July 19, 1967) born in Bicknell, Indiana, was United States Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and Robert S. McNamara's closest advisor. He died in a plane crash at age 45, just before he was to become Secretary of the Navy.
Early life
John McNaughton was born in Bicknell, Indiana; his father owned the Bicknell Daily News. The family moved to Pekin, Illinois in his younger years because his father later owned the Pekin Daily Times. John McNaughton graduated in 1942 from DePauw University. He joined the United States Navy that year and served on ships in the Atlantic. In 1946, he entered the Harvard Law School graduating in 1948. He was named a Rhodes Scholar that same year and spent 1949 at Oxford. In 1950, he took a year off and took a position in the European Payments Union under the Marshall Plan. He returned to the United States in 1951 and became editor of the Pekin Daily Times. A year later, he ran for congress in the Illinois's 18th congressional district as a Democrat. He was defeated in the election by Harold H. Velde
Career
Tall and fast-talking McNaughton began his career as an academic as an associate professor at the Harvard Law School in 1953. Major General Charles J. Timmes later said that McNaughton, during a discussion of the Vietnam War had asserted that one could find the solution to any problem "by simply dissecting it into all its elements and then piecing together the resultant formula".
He had been friends with strategic theorist (and later Nobel prize winner in economics) Thomas Schelling since they worked in the administration of the Marshall Plan in Paris. In 1964, when McNaughton and Schelling were teaching at Harvard, Schelling was asked to work at the Department of Defense. He suggested McNaughton go instead, promising to advise McNaughton on weapons and strategy; McNaughton was appointed Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs.
Together, they outlined a bombing strategy to intimidate North Vietnam in the spring of 1964, leading to the first phase of Operation Rolling Thunder which took place between March 2 and 24, 1965.
The conditions for a bombing halt, outlined in a confidential memorandum by McNaughton to McNamara were that North Vietnam must not only cease infiltration efforts, but also take steps to withdraw troops currently operating in South Vietnam. In addition, the Viet Cong should agree to terminate terror and sabotage activities and allow Saigon to exercise "governmental functions over substantially all of South Vietnam."
The North Vietnamese did not react to the bombing in the ways the American officials expected. North Vietnam was not intimidated by the bombing. Political reality had proved more complex than the abstract models of game theory.
In 1966 McNaughton and his deputy Adam Yarmolinsky had to admit, in a JASON study, that the air strikes had failed.
A pragmatist, McNaughton understood that only one aspect of the war effort was not a double-edged sword and could make the difference in the long term: the effort to turn South Vietnam into a viable political society, able to withstand the North's assault with U. S. help. In March 1965, McNaughton told President Johnson that while such efforts might not pay off quickly enough to affect the present ominous deterioration, some may, and we are dealing here in small critical margins. Furthermore, such investment [was] essential to provide a foundation for the longer run.
McNaughton was referencing the nation-building strategy devised by the Major-General Edward Lansdale, who had become a counterinsurgency expert after defeating the Huk rebellion in the Philippines in the 1950s, Sir Robert Thompson — a British counter-insurgency expert and Roger Hilsman — a former American guerilla in Burma and the director of intelligence for the Department of State in the Kennedy administration. Edward Lansdale had made the point that the South's dependency on aid had the effect of placing the U.S. in the position of providing major help on an endless basis, with the consequence that if such aid were lessened then the enemy would win.
Personal life
He was married to Sarah Elizabeth "Sally" Fulkman (born February 14, 1921). They had two sons, Alexander "Alex" and Theodore "Ted" (born July 23, 1955).
McNamara confided privately that McNaughton could have been his choice to replace him as Secretary of Defense. McNaughton resigned from the post of Assistant Secretary of Defense and was to become Secretary of the Navy on August 1, 1967 after being confirmed by the United States Senate. However, he was killed in the Piedmont Airlines Flight 22 accident with his wife and younger son Theodore on July 19, 1967.
The bridge carrying Illinois Route 9 across the Illinois River in Pekin, Illinois is named after McNaughton. There is also a John T. McNaughton Park just northeast of Pekin.

June Huh (full name: June E Huh, ; born 1983) is an American mathematician who is currently a professor at Princeton University. Previously, he was a professor at Stanford University. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 2022, and has been noted for the linkages that he has found between algebraic geometry and combinatorics.
Early life and education
Huh was born in Stanford, California while his parents were completing graduate school at Stanford University, but grew up in South Korea, where his family returned when he was approximately two years old. His father was a professor of statistics at Korea University, while his mother was a professor of Russian language at Seoul National University. Poor scores on elementary school tests convinced him that he was not very good at math. He dropped out of high school to focus on writing poetry after becoming bored and exhausted by the routine of studying. Because of this, he has been described as a late bloomer. Huh enrolled at Seoul National University (SNU) in 2002, but was initially unsettled. He initially aimed to become a science journalist and decided to major in physics and astronomy, but compiled a poor attendance record and had to repeat several courses that he initially failed.
Early in his studies he was mentored by Japanese Fields medalist mathematician Heisuke Hironaka, who went to SNU as a visiting professor. Having failed several courses, Huh took an algebraic geometry course under Hironaka in his sixth year which focused on singularity theory and was based on Hironaka's current research rather than established teaching material. Huh credited the course with sparking his interest in research-level math. Huh then proceeded to complete a master's degree at Seoul National University, while frequently travelling to Japan with Hironaka and acting as his personal assistant. Due to his poor undergraduate record, Huh was rejected from all but one of the American universities that he applied to. He started his Ph.D. studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2009, before transferring in 2011 to the University of Michigan, graduating in 2014 with a thesis written under the direction of Mircea Mustață at the age of 31. He was awarded the Sumner Byron Myers Prize for his PhD thesis.
Career
In 2009, during his PhD studies, Huh proved Read's conjecture about the unimodality of the coefficients of chromatic polynomials in the context of graph theory, which had been unresolved for more than 40 years. In joint work with Karim Adiprasito and Eric Katz, he resolved the Heron–Rota–Welsh conjecture on the log-concavity of the characteristic polynomial of matroids.
With Karim Adiprasito, he is one of five winners of the 2019 New Horizons Prize for Early-Career Achievement in Mathematics, associated with the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics. He was a winner of Blavatnik Award for Young Scientists (U.S. Regional) in 2017. Huh was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2018 in Rio de Janeiro. In 2021, he received the Samsung Ho-Am Prize in Science for physics and mathematics.
Huh was awarded the 2022 Fields Medal for "bringing the ideas of Hodge theory to combinatorics, the proof of the Dowling–Wilson conjecture for geometric lattices, the proof of the Heron–Rota–Welsh conjecture for matroids, the development of the theory of Lorentzian polynomials, and the proof of the strong Mason conjecture". He is the ninth Asian recipient of the prize and the first Korean recipient of the prize.
Personal life
Huh is married to Kim Nayoung, who he met through his mathematical studies at Seoul National University. She graduated from Seoul National University with a doctorate in mathematics. They have two sons.

The L&YR Class 26 was a class of 20 passenger steam locomotives of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway designed by Henry Hoy and introduced in 1903. Most passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) at the grouping in 1923 though they were withdrawn soon afterwards with none remaining in service after 1926.
Design and construction
Hoy intended the class to work Manchester, Rochdale, Oldham and Bury services where heavier trains and on lines gradients were giving difficulties to the Aspinall 2-4-2T radial tank locomotives. To a degree they were an evolutionary design based on the enlarged version of the 2-4-2T radial tanks with six-coupled wheels and the belpaire firebox used on the Aspinall Atlantic High Flyers and Coal engine 0-8-0 types.
Service
On their introduction in 1903 they were allocated to Liverpool to Southport workings covering a temporary shortage of electric stock; they were subsequently placed on their intended routes where they had an initially successful introduction. Problems with the class shortly emerged. Their heavy weight was not good for the track and the long rigid wheelbase put pressure on rails with severe curves in sidings. The flanges were removed from the centre driving wheels which eased some issues but increased the risk of derailment on track which was slightly out of alignment and particularly notably at junctions, flangeless driving wheels working better on smaller wheels placed closer together. The side tanks had a propensity to severely leak and they gained a reputation for poor stopping ability.
Where George Hughes produced a superheated upgrade to the 2-4-2T radial tank they were able to perform the services allocated to the 2-6-2Ts and the latter were removed from passenger services in 1913 and placed on banking and shunting duties with water pickup equipment and coal rail removed for increased visibility for these duties. They were not best suited to these duties due to large driving wheels and having the flanges on the centre wheels removed.
Numbering
Withdrawal
One was withdrawn with unrepairable cracked frames in 1920. A total of thee, Nos 202, 404 and 125 were withdrawn before being allocated a LMS number in 1923. In the event only two (11704 and 11711) actually carried their allocated LMS number and all members of the class were withdrawn by 1926. All had been scrapped by 1928 and none have been preserved.

Bartolo is a barrio in the municipality of Lares, Puerto Rico. Its population in 2010 was 2,035. Bartolo is on the southeastern border of Lares and Adjuntas.
History
Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Bartolo barrio was 2,035.
Sectors
Barrios (which are roughly comparable to minor civil divisions) and subbarrios, in turn, are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others.
The following sectors are in Bartolo barrio:

Jíbaros Mutual Support Center
The , a school that was built in 1922 was closed in 2015 by the Puerto Rico Department of Education. A group of residents, who farm the land (jíbaros), rehabilitated the school and put it to use, after they were left homeless when their homes were destroyed by Hurricane Maria in September 2017. The group received support from a number of businesses including a donation of solar panels. With their work, the once abandoned school is now called the Jíbaros Mutual Support Center (), and the classrooms serve as residences to eleven families (to families with a woman head of household and to elderly). There are micro-businesses, including a theater, operating from the location. Members of the local Presbyterian church who spearheaded the grassroots movement for Bartolo are pursuing official ownership of the property. Similar Mutual Support Centers have popped up around the island.

Newton Requa Russell (June 25, 1927 – May 18, 2013) was an American businessman and politician.
Born in Los Angeles, California, Russell attended Los Angeles High School and the Webb School of California. He served in the United States Navy during World War II. He then graduated from University of Southern California and was a special agent for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance for twelve years. He served in the California State Assembly from 1964 to 1974 as a Republican representing the 62nd district, but following reapportionment his district was merged, and he lost his seat to fellow Republican Michael D. Antonovich in the 1974 primaries. However, a resignation that year led to a vacancy in the California State Senate for the 21st district, and Russell defeated Arthur K. Snyder in the resulting special election. He was chairman of the Senate Public Employment and Retirement Committee, and remained a member of the Senate until 1996. He died of lung cancer at his home in La Cañada Flintridge, California in 2013.

Jean-Baptiste Nolin (–1708) was a French cartographer and engraver.
Life and career
Jean-Baptiste Nolin was born . He trained with the engraver François de Poilly, which caught the attention of the Italian cartographer Vincenzo Coronelli, who invited him to engrave his own maps. In 1694 Nolin was named geographer to the Duke of Orléans (Philippe II), and in 1701 he was named engraver to the king (Louis XIV). Nolin set up a family publishing house on Rue Saint-Jacques, Paris, which was initially unsuccessful until it was moved nearer to other geographers on Quai de l'Horloge. Many of Nolin's maps were based on previous works by Coronelli and the amateur geographer Jean-Nicholas de Tralage, known as Sieur de Tillemon, who supplied him with most of his material.
In 1700, Nolin published Le Globe Terreste, a 125×140 cm world map. He was subsequently accused of plagiarism by Claude Delisle, the father of Guillaume Delisle, another cartographer. Claude accused Nolin of copying both the shape of California (depicting it as a peninsula rather than an island) and the mouth of the Mississippi River from a manuscript globe by Guillaume, which he had been working on since 1697 for Louis Boucherat, the chancellor of France. Nolin denied these accusations. Eventually, both Nolin and Guillaume were compelled to present their respective maps before a panel of experts, and to explain their sources for them. Nolin argued that the information he had used for his map was in the public domain, but the panel ruled in the Delisles' favour. Nolin was ordered to stop producing his map. The entire case took six years.
Nolin's son, also named Jean-Baptiste Nolin (1686–1762), took over the business upon his father's death. Jean-Baptiste the younger produced an atlas that was published posthumously in 1783, 21 years after his death.

This is a complete list of United States senators during the 116th United States Congress listed by seniority, from January 3, 2019, to January 3, 2021. It is a historical listing and will contain people who have not served the entire two-year Congress should anyone resign, die, or be expelled.
In this Congress, Kyrsten Sinema is the most junior senior senator and Maria Cantwell is the most senior junior senator.
Order of service is based on the commencement of the senator's first term. Behind this is former service as a senator (only giving the senator seniority within his or her new incoming class), service as vice president, a House member, a cabinet secretary, or a governor of a state. The final factor is the population of the senator's state.

The Port Washington Narrows is a tidal strait located in Bremerton, Washington, United States. The northwest entrance is marked on the west side by Rocky Point, and the southeast entrance is located at Point Turner on the west side and Point Herron on the east side. It is located between downtown Bremerton and the Manette Peninsula.
It is through this channel that Dyes Inlet drains into Sinclair Inlet and into Puget Sound. Tidal currents attain velocities in excess of 4 knots at times.
The Narrows divide the city of Bremerton into east and west portions, which are connected by the Manette Bridge and the Warren Avenue Bridge. There are much petroleum distribution facilities with storage tanks and receiving wharves along the western shore of the Narrows between the Manette Bridge and Phinney Bay.

The World Wars is a three-part, six-hour event miniseries by the History Channel that premiered on Monday, May 26, 2014, (Memorial Day) airing for three consecutive nights. An extended version of the series, divided into six episodes with never before seen footage, was subsequently broadcast on H2 and in more than 160 countries on June 22, 2014.
Narrated by Jeremy Renner, the documentary series features a mix of dramatic reenactments, archival stills and footage, and interviews with historians and authors alongside current and former prominent political figures such as former U.S. Senator John McCain from Arizona, former U.S. General and Secretary of State Colin Powell, former British prime minister John Major, former Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, former U.K. Foreign Secretary David Miliband and many more.
The show was produced for History Channel by Stephen David Entertainment, the production company behind the Emmy Award-winning miniseries The Men Who Built America. A portion of the filming took place in and around Martinsburg, West Virginia in the United States during October and November 2013. The series was introduced by United States President Barack Obama in a pre-recorded message.
Plot
According to the History Channel, the miniseries "showcase(s) the thirty year period that changed the course of human history", documenting both World Wars and the interwar era in a continuous timeline from 1914 to 1945. The series takes a personality-driven approach, focusing on some of the key players of World War II (Hitler, Mussolini, Patton, Stalin, Churchill, Roosevelt), and chronicling how their experiences as younger men in the First World War shaped them into the leaders they became in World War II.

Early life
Isayev was born in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, into a family with strong connections to the performing arts through his parents' involvement with the Tovstonogov Bolshoi Drama Theater (the son of a famous Soviet actor Vladislav Strzhelchik). He studied violin and piano.
Isayev held various jobs prior to entering the Saint Petersburg State Theatre Arts Academy from which he subsequently graduated in 1996. He served in the theater "Russian Enterprise" named after Andrei Mironov, "Comedian's Shelter" in the Komissarjevsky Theatre. In parallel, he worked fitness trainer, a masseur a store manager and was involved in dance, writing and song arranging. He appeared on television and radio programs. He was the second director in dubbing and film scoring.
Personal life
He married three times and twice divorced. His first marriage yielded two children, Sophia and Pauline. Isayev's first wife was Asya Shibarova, a classmate at the institute, and now an actress. The marriage ended amicably.
His second wife was prima ballerina Inna Ginkevich. He then married Oksana Рожок, a former ballet dancer, and resides in Serpukhov. In 2014, the couple had a son Alex.

Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.

James MacHugo was an Irish merchant who in the revolutionary period 1797–1799 helped build a United Irish organisation in his native Loughrea, County Galway.
MacHugo was a merchant trading in tobacco until found guilty of smuggling, which led to revenue officers impounding his entire stock and putting him out of business. He became involved in the United Irishman movement, acting as a link between members in Loughrea and its environs and in Dublin.
He was a close associate of Francis Dillon and Peter Finnerty, all of whom helped build the society's network in the town, especially among its lower-class tradesmen. When Finnerty, as publisher of the United Irish paper the Press, was imprisoned in Dublin in spring 1798, he continued to stay in touch with the society in Loughrea via MacHugo; a report dated April 1798 stated that "There is strong ground to think that Peter Finnerty corresponds with his friends in this town thro' this man."
The local Anglo-Irish lord, Richard Trench, 2nd Earl of Clancarty, characterised the activities of MacHugo and associates as providing local people a "secret introduction of modern philosophical opinions." Administration of seditious oaths and violent outbreaks, especially in the Slieve Aughty region, were on the rise at the time. However, because guns and ammunition were successfully seized by the authorities, when the actual Irish Rebellion of 1798 broke out, County Galway remained quiet.
In January 1799 MacHugo was still under surveillance, as the county was again disturbed and fears of a further rising were very great. Despite this, MacHugo remained free, and fades from the historical record afterward.

The New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad was a Class I railroad in Louisiana and Mississippi in the United States. The railroad operated of road from its completion in 1883 until it was absorbed by the Alabama Great Southern Railroad subsidiary of the Southern Railway in 1969.
History
The New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad was incorporated in 1868 in Louisiana (under the name of Mandeville and Sulphur Springs Railroad until 1870) and 1871 in Mississippi. No track was built, however, and the company's land lay unused until 1881, when control of the company was acquired by the Alabama, New Orleans, Texas and Pacific Junction Railways Company. Construction on the line began in 1882. The line opened in 1883 and extended 196 miles from New Orleans to Meridian, Mississippi.
In 1916 the Southern Railway acquired the NO&NE, which had been marketed as a portion of the Queen and Crescent Route since the 1880s. From that point on the NO&NE owned or were assigned locomotives and other equipment wore Southern lettering but carried NO&NE sublettering until the line was merged into the Alabama Great Southern in the late-60s, at which time sublettering was changed to AGS.
In 1969, as part of an effort to simplify its corporate structure, the Southern Railway's Alabama Great Southern Railroad operating subsidiary merged the NO&NE, ending its existence on paper.
In 1960 NO&NE reported 746 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 13 million passenger-miles; at the end of that year it operated 203 miles of road and 368 miles of track.
Today
The line remains in operation today. After a merger, the Southern Railway changed its name to the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1990.

Yonaguska, (1759–1839), who was known as Drowning Bear (the English meaning of his name), was a leader among the Cherokee of the Lower Towns of North Carolina.
During the Indian Removal of the late 1830s, he was the only chief who remained in the hills to rebuild the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, joined by others who had escaped or eluded the United States soldiers. Before that time, he had adopted William Holland Thomas as his son; the fatherless European-American youth was working at the trading post and had learned Cherokee. Yonaguska taught him Cherokee ways and, after Thomas became an attorney, he represented the tribe in negotiations with the federal government. Thomas was never a Chief of any Cherokee band but played important roles. Thomas bought land and established a Cherokee reserve for the tribe's use at what is now the Qualla Boundary, the territory of the federally recognized tribe in North Carolina.
During his life, Yonaguska was a reformer and a prophet; he was a leader who recognized the destructive power of the white man's liquor and the settlers' insatiable greed for Cherokee lands.
Early life
Yonaguska was born about 1759 in the Cherokee Lower Towns of present-day North Carolina and Georgia. According to the Cherokee matrilineal system of inheritance and descent, he was considered born into his Cherokee mother's clan, where he gained his status. As a boy of 12, Yonaguska had a vision that the European Americans threatened the Cherokee way of life, but people did not pay attention when he spoke of it. At age 17, he witnessed widespread destruction by Gen. Griffith Rutherford and his North Carolina militia, who in 1776 burned 36 Cherokee towns during the military action. The Cherokee had been allied with the British, and the colonials were trying to discourage them from acting in the coming revolution.
Yonaguska was described as a strikingly handsome man, strongly built, and standing . He suffered from becoming addicted to alcohol as a young man. He and his wife adopted as their son William Holland Thomas, a fatherless European-American youth who worked at the trading post at Qualla Town and learned the Cherokee language. Thomas learned many Cherokee ways.
Awakening
In 1819 when he was 60 years old, Yonaguska became critically ill. He had a vision, which he told his people after recovering. His message from the spirit world was that, "The Cherokee must never again drink whiskey. Whiskey must be banished."
He had Will Thomas write out a pledge: "The undersigned Cherokees, belonging to the town of Qualla agree to abandon the use of spirituous liquors." Yonaguska signed it, followed by the council (chiefs of the clans) and town residents. From the signing of the pledge until Yonaguska's death in 1839 at the age of 80, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians refrained from using liquor. On the few occasions when he learned of someone breaking the pledge, Yonaguska had the culprit whipped.
Throughout the early 19th century, federal agents tried to persuade Yonaguska to remove his people to lands west of the Mississippi River. He firmly resisted their efforts, declaring that the Cherokee were safer among their rocks and mountains, and belonged in their ancestral homeland. Other chiefs made the Treaty of 1819, by which they sold Cherokee lands along the Tuckasegee River. At the time, Yonaguska was given to set aside in a bend of the river between Ela and Bryson City, including the ancient Mississippian culture site of Kituwa, which the Cherokee held sacred.
As pressure increased by the federal government for removal of Indians from the Southeast, Yonaguska rejected every offer for land exchange and subsidies. Having seen European-American settlers push westward through North Carolina, he did not believe they would ever be satisfied. He did not want to leave his homeland and face more removal pressure later. He thought the United States government promises of protection were "too often broken; they are like the reeds in yonder river—they are all lies."
The missionary Samuel Goodenough worked with Elias Boudinot to translate and print the Gospel of St Matthew in Cherokee. Yonaguska insisted on hearing it read to him before allowing its circulation. He reportedly said about the gospel:
Well, it seems a good book - strange that the white people are no better, after having had it so long.
Yonaguska approved the distribution of the scriptures to his people.
Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians
The treaties of 1817 and 1819 with the federal government reduced the territory of the Cherokee Nation in North Carolina, as they gave up land to European-American settlers. In 1824 Yonaguska gathered the remaining Cherokee outside the new boundaries.
They settled together at Soco Creek on lands purchased for them by his adopted son, Will Thomas, as the Cherokee were not allowed to buy land outside their nation. Although adopted as Yonaguska's son, Thomas was still considered "white" under the law and could legally buy land; he could also allow the Cherokee to live on "his" property. Purchased for the use of the Cherokee, his land was the basis of Qualla Boundary. It is now the territory of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, a federally recognized tribe.
Death
Shortly before his death in April 1839, Yonaguska was carried into the town house at Soco, where he gave a last talk to his people. The old man commended Thomas to them as their chief and warned them against ever leaving their own country. Wrapping his blanket around him, he quietly lay back and died.
Yonaguska was buried beside Soco Creek, about a mile below the old Macedonia mission, with a mound of stones to mark the spot.

Cable cars in Haifa refers to two cable car systems in Haifa, Israel: the tourist-oriented Bat Galim cable car system that runs up Mount Carmel from the Bat Galim promenade in the western part of the city, and the Rakavlit – a public-transportation aerial tramway in the southeastern part of the city, which ascends from the Haifa Bay public transit hub to the hilly areas housing the University of Haifa and the Technion.
Bat Galim cable car
A tourist cable car runs up and down the mountain from the top of the Carmel, across from the Stella Maris Carmelite Monastery, to Bat Galim, with views of Haifa Bay and its surroundings. The cable car began operating in 1986. The route is 355 meters long.
Rakavlit - commuter service
The רכבלית/Rakavlit (a diminutive of רכבל, meaning cable car, and itself a contraction of רכבת, train, and כבל, cable), is a gondola lift that is a part of the city's expanded public transport system complementing the existing city bus and Metronit BRT lines.
The cable car's route runs from the HaMifratz Central Bus Station and public transit hub at the foot of Mount Carmel to the Technion and then onto the University of Haifa, for a total distance of 4.4 kilometres and an elevation gain of 460m. Most of the passengers are expected to be students. Total travel time from the Check Post Junction to the University of Haifa was originally estimated at 17 minutes. More recent estimates, however, indicate that travel time will be 19 minutes.
The cable car, which will have six stations when complete, was named through a competition open to schools in the Haifa municipality. A similar contest was held in 2010 to choose the name of Haifa's Metronit lines.
The Yefeh Nof municipal development company began work on the system in June 2017. Original estimates indicated that the project would cost an estimated 280 million NIS. It is part of a wider plan to address traffic congestion in Haifa, and in particular, on the two university campuses. It is anticipated that all discounts (such as student and senior rates) presently available on other transit systems will be available on the cable car, which will also be fully accessible to individuals with disabilities.
An anticipated 150 fully-accessible cable cars will each hold up to ten passengers, departing from the stations every 15 seconds. Total passenger capacity is estimated to be up to 2,400 passengers per hour in each direction. The journey from the Haifa Bay Central Station (Merkazit Hamifratz) to the Technion will take about 10 minutes, and another 9 minutes from the Technion to the University of Haifa.
Test runs began on the cable car line in April 2021, with a planned opening date of October 10, 2021. However, media reports the following day indicated that while all infrastructure was complete, a dispute had arisen with Doppelmayr Cable Car, the Austrian cable car manufacturer which was delaying the inauguration of the service. According to official statements from the Israeli Ministry of Transportation, the dispute was contractual in nature, while inside sources believed the dispute was financial in nature, with Doppelmayr demanding a further 20 million Euros in payment before they activate the system.
Doppelmayr also built the cars currently in use for Haifa's Carmelit underground funicular railway line, the shortest subway system in the world, with only four cars, six stations and a single tunnel 1.8 km (1.1 mi) long.

The Compagnie du Sénégal (SCOA) (French for "the Senegal Company" or "Company of the Senegal"), officially the Compagnie du Sénégal et de la Côte occidentale d'Afrique ("Company of the Senegal and of the West Coast of Africa") was a 19th-century colonial French company involved in the palm oil trade in Nigeria.
The company was founded at Marseilles by a M. Verminck. Along with the French Equatorial African Association, the Senegal Company received subsidies from the Léon Gambetta administration and was intended to establish French claims on the lower Niger. Two years after it was founded, the company became a joint stock company, with Verminck as manager.
At its height, it operated 14 trading posts on the Niger and Benue rivers. The company also has two agencies in Manchester and Liverpool, which make purchases of goods from the leading textile industrial power, then exchanged on the west coast of Africa, where it has nine agencies, eighteen sub-counters, 80 European and 300 African employees.
Following a years-long price war and Gambetta's death in 1882, the company sold its interests in the region to the British United African Company in October 1884.

Renzo Bossi (born 8 September 1988) is an ex Italian politician, influencer, son of Umberto Bossi, founder and former leader of the Lega Nord party. In 2010 he was elected as a member of the Regional Council of Lombardy.
He is known as "il trota" (Italian for "the trout") since 2008, when Umberto Bossi was asked if he considered Renzo to be his dauphin (dauphin and dolphin are homonym in Italian) and he jokingly compared him to a trout instead.
Biography
Bossi was born to Manuela Marrone and Umberto Bossi, both active in the early days of the Lega Lombarda and the Lega Nord. During January 2009 he took his first official position in the movement when he became a member of the Monitoring Centre for transparency and effectiveness in Fiera Milano. In the same year he became an ordinary member of the Lega Nord and in 2010 he was a candidate in the Lombard regional election. His candidacy was controversial since it didn't respect the party's internal regulations about seniority. Despite the criticism of apparent nepotism, he was elected in the Regional Council with 12,893 votes.
During the investigation regarding the misappropriation of party funding in April 2010, circumstantial evidence about his involvement was found and by the end of the month he resigned from his position in the Council. In an Interview for Oggi his personal driver and bodyguard, Alessandro Marmello, revealed footage proving Renzo Bossi's illegal activities. He was officially charged with embezzlement when the public prosecutor in Milan began the investigation in May.
In the same year a bachelor's degree in Economics and Management earned by Bossi at Kristal University in Albania was found during a search performed by Guardia di Finanza officers. The faculty director claimed that Renzo Bossi started attending the courses in 2007, before completing secondary school. In early December 2013 he was later charged with corruption in Albania because he earned a degree in social sciences without spending a single day in university. He has never been in Albania and he doesn't know the language.

Charlie Wild, Private Detective is an American detective series that aired on three of the four major American television networks of the 1950s.
Origin
The program was the televised version of a radio program with the same title. At least some of the episodes that were broadcast on CBS were simulcasts of the radio program.
Premise
Charlie Wild was a private investigator with headquarters in New York City, with most of his cases involving murder. He often used violence to solve cases, bending the law at times without actually breaking it. Effie Perrine was Wild's secretary.
A review of the program's premiere episode in the trade publication Billboard described the plot as "run-of-the-mill" except that "the menace ran to silk dressing gowns and Beethoven symphonies" as Wild solved two murders. The reviewer summarized by saying that the show needed "more original story approach and less hokum."
A subsequent Billboard review (of the September 11, 1951, episode) indicated little change in evaluation. Haps Kemper wrote that the "plot was routine, the script hardly scintillating, and the performance unenthusiastic" except for that of the female guest star.
Broadcasts
The series first aired live on CBS from December 22, 1950, to June 27, 1951 (20 episodes). It was initially on alternate Friday nights, but it moved to every Wednesday night effective the week of April 16. It then aired on ABC from September 11, 1951, to March 4, 1952 (27 episodes). On March 13, 1952, the DuMont Television Network picked the series up for the last three months, with 17 episodes, ending on June 19, 1952.
The CBS broadcasts were sponsored by Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic. The ABC series was sponsored by Mogen David wine.
Cast
John McQuade replaced Kevin O'Morrison as Charlie Wild after the first seven episodes. Cloris Leachman played Effie Perrine. Sandy Becker and Bob Williams were the announcers.
Episode status
Fifteen episodes are held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, including two from the DuMont series. The Paley Center for Media holds four episodes from the DuMont series.

Nicola Lewis (born 9 February 1977) was a Welsh netball player, playing in the positions of Goal Shooter and Goal Attack.
Lewis has represented Wales at all age groups and appeared as a member of the Wales national netball team at the World Youth Cup in Canada in 1996. She has gained 29 caps for Wales including the 1999 Netball World Championships in Christchurch, NZ and the 2002 European Netball Championships. She was selected as part of the squad of 17 to represent Wales at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, but unfortunately broke her ankle during preparation and was forced to withdraw from the squad.
After missing out on the Commonwealth Games, Lewis retired from international netball but continued to play for her club, Cardiff Central. She joined the club as an 11-year-old after her PE teachers saw her play at school and recruited her. Lewis worked as a P.E teacher and as a Netball Development Officer for the Caerphilly County Borough Council. Her netball career saw something of a revival, however, with the birth of the United Kingdom–wide Netball Superleague in 2006, with Lewis appearing for the Welsh Celtic Dragons team. She was subsequently selected to go to the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia.

Salvia muirii is an evergreen perennial shrub native to limited areas east of the Cape of Good Hope and Mossel Bay on the southern coast of South Africa. It grows in an area influenced by the climate of the Indian Ocean, on rolling hills between 200 and 1000 feet elevation. The plant was first collected by Dr. John Muir, a Scottish physician and plant collector who spent many years in South Africa. Muir wrote to the botanist Harriet Margaret Louisa Bolus, who named the plant after him.
Salvia muirii reaches 2 feet tall in its native habitat, less in cultivation. It grows into a stiff erect shrub, with small branches and tiny .75 inch olive-green leaves. The leaves appear smaller because each one is slightly folded along the middle. When crushed, they give off an aroma described as "reminiscent of a medicine cabinet" or of Vicks. The short inflorescences hold violet-blue flowers in whorls of two or three. The lower lip of the flower has a prominent white beeline, while the upper lip is short, straight, and one color.

Cedewain (or Cydewain) was a medieval cantref in the Kingdom of Powys. It possibly consisted of the commotes (cymydau) of Cynan, Hafren and Uwch Hanes. Other sources give the commotes as Cedewain, Eginlle and Ceri.
It lay at the south of the kingdom, bordering with the cantrefi of Caereinion and Ystlyg to the north across the river Rhiw, and the cantrefi of Arwystli (subject to disputes between Powys and Gwynedd) and Maelienydd (originally an independent kingdom) to the south. Its easterly border, which was the River Severn, faced England.
Bettws Cedewain takes its name from the cantref. The lords of Cedewain resided at Dolforwyn Castle. Maredudd ap Rhobert was Lord of Cedewain and Chief Counsellor of Wales when he died in 1244 after joining the religious order at Strata Florida Abbey.
Knighton was attacked by 'the lords of Ceri and Cydewain' in 1260, but the following year saw the death of Owain ap Maredudd, Lord of Cydewain, nephew of Maredudd ap Rhobert. In early 1278, his daughter Angharad claimed Cydewain in litigation as Owain's heir, stating that Owain's enemy, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, had taken possession of it immediately after her father's death.
In 1330-1331 Maredudd ap Madog and Owain ap Madog petitioned King Edward III for a judgement on the ownership of Cedewain, which was then under the king's control. They claimed to be the rightful heirs to the cantref and that it was seized from their ancestors by the Marcher Lord family of the Mortimers. They said that Roger Mortimer had allowed them to keep some land between the River Severn and Ceri (the northern commote of Maelienydd), but Edmund had seized that too.

History of Powys
George Washington Manypenny (1808 – July 15, 1892) was the Commissioner of Indian Affairs of the United States from 1853 to 1857.
Early life
George Washington Manypenny was born in 1808 in Uniontown, Pennsylvania. He moved to Ohio around 1830 and settled in St. Clairsville, Ohio.
Career
After moving to St. Clairsville, Manypenny became the editor and proprietor of the St. Clairsville Gazette. He owned a stage line that ran on the National Road, from Maryland to Ohio. He also served as superintendent of a portion of the National Road. In 1836, Manypenny and two partners organized the Opposition Defiance Fast Lane, a mail carrier organization. In 1838, Manypenny moved to Zanesville, Ohio. He worked as a contractor on the first dam and canal in Zanesville on the Muskingum River.
In 1842, Manypenny was admitted to the bar in Muskingum County. He practiced law with Corrington Searle and John O'Neill. He served as clerk of the circuit court based in Zanesville from 1841 to 1846.
In 1853, Manypenny was a competitor at the Democratic State Convention for governor, but lost the nomination to William Medill. Manypenny was appointed as Commissioner of Indian Affairs during the administration of President Franklin Pierce, serving from 1853 to 1857. He was responsible for settling 52 treaties during his tenure, many of them in Kansas and Nebraska. He was offered the role of commissioner again by President Abraham Lincoln during his second administration, but Manypenny declined. He held the position of special Indian commissioner under appointments by Presidents Grant, Hayes and Garfield.
Manypenny then moved to Columbus, Ohio. From 1859 to 1862 Manypenny was editor of the Ohio Statesman. He then retired from the newspaper business. He was appointed as Superintendent of the Ohio State Canals by the Governor, and worked as the general manager of the public works of Ohio. He ran as a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate, but lost in the Democratic caucus. In 1876 Manypenny was appointed chair of a special commission to investigate the issues that led to the Sioux outbreak that year, which included the defeat of the American forces under George Armstrong Custer at the battle of the Little Bighorn. In 1880 Manypenny served as president of the commission for the Ute people.
In 1880 Manypenny wrote Our Indian Wards which detailed a variety of wrongs perpetrated on the Indians, along with recommendations for reforms.
Personal life
Manypenny married three times. He married Miss Ellis of St. Clairsville. Her brother-in-laws included William Kennon Sr., Hugh J. Jewett, Wilson Shannon and Isaac E. Eaton. He married Emeline Neale (died 1849) of Parkersburg, West Virginia. He married Mary B. Woods, sister of United States Supreme Court Justice William Burnham Woods and General Charles R. Woods. He had at least five children, including Willie, Elizabeth/Bettie, Lewis, Sallie and Burnham W.
Manypenny lived at a three-story house on North Fourth Street in Zanesville. He was a member of the Methodist Church.
In 1880, Manypenny moved to Washington, D.C. Manypenny died on July 15, 1892, at his home in Bowie, Maryland.

PM² (pronounced “P-M squared”) is a project management methodology developed and endorsed by the European Commission (EC). It is the official project management methodology of the EC, incorporating elements from a range of widely accepted best practices in project management, and builds heavily on PMBOK, PRINCE2, IPMA-ICB, CMMI, TEMPO, and operational experience from EU institutions.
In essence, the PM² methodology provides:
Project governance structure
Process guidelines
Artefact templates
Guidelines for using the artefacts
Set of effective mindsets.
PM² certification exams are available in the 28 EU countries via Prometric, but are only available to EU institutions' staff. In 2016, the European Commission issued an open guide to the PM² methodology, freely available through the EU Bookshop/Publications. However, as of July 2017, the certification program is still available only to the EU institutions' staff.
A synopsis of PM² was published in 2018 by the European Commission (PM² Overview) and was translated in numerous languages to support the roll out of the methodology to the European (primarily) countries.
History
The PM² methodology was developed in 2007, and the first version was released via the PM² Wiki in 2008.
Some milestones in the development of methodology include:
2007: Introduction of roles and responsibilities for IT projects.
2008: Introduction of PM²
2009: Pilot implementation of PM²
2009 Project management courses for PM²
2011: Endorsement by CTI.
2012: Release of the PM² Training Programme for IT Projects
2012: Release of the PM² Guide, 1st Edition (PDF)
2012: Training Courses for Business Managers
2013: Release of the PM² Methodology 2.0 and the PM² Guide, 2st Edition (PDF)

Unni Elisabeth Wilhelmsen (born 12 July 1971) is a Norwegian singer, songwriter, and musician. Her musical influences are pop music and the American tradition of the singer-songwriter in which the lyrics play an important role as well as the music. She lives in Oslo but has throughout her career had the whole of Norway as a venue. When she made her breakthrough in 1996 with her debut album To Whom It May Concern (Polygram), she became an important mediator of the singer-songwriter genre, a genre that has a broad audience in Norwegian popular music.
Career
Wilhelmsen was born in Oslo. She was given a guitar as a teenager and so the guitar became her first instrument. However, she had always dreamed of playing the piano, and later took it up. Her first tune featuring the piano came in 2006. She writes most of her music herself, but from time to time collaborates with others. Wilhelmsen is a full-time musician and releases her music on her own indie label, St. Cecilia Music. In addition to pursuing her solo career, in September 2013, Unni joined the Norwegian Band "Di Derre" as a guitarist and vocalist.
Her debut as singer was at Smuget in Oslo, where music journalist Finn Bjelke was present. He liked what he heard and mentioned her to music producer Ole Evenrud at Polygram. This led to her first record contract, and her debut album To Whom It May Concern was released on Polygram 1996. She was awarded Spellemannprisen 1996 in two categories for this album. International release on Universal Music of To whom it may concern in Germany followed, but her international career was slow to develop. She started her own record company to be in charge. Now her audience outside Norway is growing; in effect she functions as her own distributor and a subcontractor for her former label, Universal.
Private life
Wilhelmsen lives in Oslo, Norway. She has installed her own studio in the kitchen, Fett Studio, and most of her album Til Meg (St. Cecilia Music, 2006) was recorded there.

Hiroyuki Iwatsuki (岩月 博之) (born 1970) is a Japanese video game music composer who has contributed to the soundtracks of Ninja Warriors, Pocky & Rocky, and Omega Five. He has been composing and arranging songs for the game company Natsume beginning as early as the 1991 NES title Chaos World.
For his score to the Xbox Live Arcade shooter Omega Five, Iwatsuki employed his years of experience creating game soundtracks to fashion retro versions of his songs to simulate the feel of a 16-bit game. An album release was planned after game composer Manabu Namiki listened to the soundtrack prior to the release and suggested the sound design team Super Sweep participate in arrangements for the album.

Bunsen is a lunar impact crater that lies near the northwestern limb of the Moon. It is located to the west of the Oceanus Procellarum and the crater von Braun. To the southeast is the crater Lavoisier, and to the northeast lies Gerard. Northwest of Bunsen, on the far side of the Moon, is McLaughlin. Due to its position this crater appears foreshortened when viewed from the Earth, and its visibility is affected by libration.
This crater has become considerably worn and eroded by subsequent impacts, leaving a formation that has been described as disintegrated. The most intact portion of the rim is along the northeastern side. There is a smaller, crater-like formation intruding into the southeastern rim. Within the crater, the floor is pitted by tiny impacts, and has a rille system of criss-crossing clefts near the northern and southern rims. There is a low ridge near the southwest corner of the interior.
Satellite craters
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bunsen.

W, or w, is the twenty-third and fourth-to-last letter of the modern English and ISO basic Latin alphabets. It represents a consonant, but in some languages it represents a vowel. Its name in English is double-u, plural double-ues.
History
The classical Latin alphabet, from which the modern European alphabets derived, did not have the "W' character. The "W" sounds were represented by the Latin letter "V" (at the time, not yet distinct from "U").
The sounds (spelled ) and (spelled ) of Classical Latin developed into a bilabial fricative between vowels in Early Medieval Latin. Therefore, no longer adequately represented the labial-velar approximant sound of Germanic phonology.
The Germanic phoneme was therefore written as or ( and becoming distinct only by the Early Modern period) by the earliest writers of Old English and Old High German, in the 7th or 8th centuries. Gothic (not Latin-based), by contrast, had simply used a letter based on the Greek Υ for the same sound in the 4th century. The digraph / was also used in Medieval Latin to represent Germanic names, including Gothic ones like Wamba.
It is from this digraph that the modern name "double U" derives. The digraph was commonly used in the spelling of Old High German, but only in the earliest texts in Old English, where the sound soon came to be represented by borrowing the rune , adapted as the Latin letter wynn: . In early Middle English, following the 11th-century Norman Conquest, gained popularity again and by 1300 it had taken wynn's place in common use.
Scribal realisation of the digraph could look like a pair of Vs whose branches crossed in the middle. Another, common in roundhand, kurrent and blackletter, takes the form of an whose rightmost branch curved around as in a cursive (viz. ) It was used up to the nineteenth century in Britain and continues to be familiar in Germany.
The shift from the digraph to the distinct ligature is thus gradual, and is only apparent in abecedaria, explicit listings of all individual letters. It was probably considered a separate letter by the 14th century in both Middle English and Middle German orthography, although it remained an outsider, not really considered part of the Latin alphabet proper, as expressed by Valentin Ickelshamer in the 16th century, who complained that:
In Middle High German (and possibly already in late Old High German), the West Germanic phoneme became realized as ; this is why, today, the German represents that sound.
Pronunciation and use
English
English uses to represent . There are also a number of words beginning with a written that is silent in most dialects before a (pronounced) , remaining from usage in Old English in which the was pronounced: wreak, wrap, wreck, wrench, wroth, wrinkle, etc. Certain dialects of Scottish English still distinguish this digraph. represents a vowel sound, , in the word pwn, and in the Welsh loanwords cwm and crwth it retains the Welsh pronunciation, . is also used in digraphs: , , . It is the fifteenth most frequently used letter in the English language, with a frequency of about 2.56% in words.
Other languages
In Europe languages with in native words are in a central-western European zone between Cornwall and Poland: English, German, Low German, Dutch, Frisian, Welsh, Cornish, Breton, Walloon, Polish, Kashubian, Sorbian, Wymysorys, Resian and Scandinavian dialects. German, Polish, Wymysorys and Kashubian use it for the voiced labiodental fricative (with Polish, related Kashubian and Wymysorys using Ł for , except in conservative and some eastern Polish speech, where Ł still represents the dark L sound.), and Dutch uses it for . Unlike its use in other languages, the letter is used in Welsh and Cornish to represent the vowel as well as the related approximant consonant .
The following languages historically used for in native words, but later replaced it by : Swedish, Finnish, Czech, Slovak, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Ukrainian Łatynka and Belarusian Łacinka. It is also used in modern systems of Romanization of Belarusian for the letter , for example in the BGN/PCGN system, in contrast to the letter , which is used in the Instruction on transliteration of Belarusian geographical names with letters of Latin script.
In Swedish and Finnish, traces of this old usage may still be found in proper names. In Hungarian remains in some aristocratic surnames, e.g. Wesselényi.
Modern German dialects generally have only or for West Germanic , but is still heard allophonically for , especially in the clusters , , and . Some Bavarian dialects preserve a "light" initial , such as in wuoz (Standard German weiß '[I] know'). The Classical Latin is heard in the Southern German greeting Servus ('hello' or 'goodbye').
In Dutch, became a labiodental approximant (with the exception of words with -, which have , or other diphthongs containing -). In many Dutch-speaking areas, such as Flanders and Suriname, the pronunciation is used at all times.
In Finnish, is sometimes seen as a variant of and not a separate letter, but it is a part of official alphabet. It is, however, recognized and maintained in the spelling of some old names, reflecting an earlier German spelling standard, and in some modern loan words. In all cases, it is pronounced .
In Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, is named double-v and not double-u. In these languages, the letter only exists in old names, loanwords and foreign words. (Foreign words are distinguished from loanwords by having a significantly lower level of integration in the language.) It is usually pronounced , but in some words of English origin it may be pronounced . The letter was officially introduced in the Danish and Swedish alphabets as late as 1980 and 2006, respectively, despite having been in use for much longer. It had been recognized since the conception of modern Norwegian, with the earliest official orthography rules of 1907. was earlier seen as a variant of , and as a letter (double-v) is still commonly replaced by in speech (e.g. WC being pronounced as VC, www as VVV, WHO as VHO, etc.) The two letters were sorted as equals before was officially recognized, and that practice is still recommended when sorting names in Sweden. In modern slang, some native speakers may pronounce more closely to the origin of the loanword than the official pronunciation.
Multiple dialects of Swedish and Danish use the sound however. In Denmark notably in Jutland, where the northern half use it extensively in traditional dialect, and multiple places in Sweden. It is used in southern Swedish, for example in Halland where the words "wesp" (wisp) and "wann" (water) are traditionally used. In northern and western Sweden there are also dialects with . Elfdalian is a good example, which is one of many dialects where the Old Norse difference between v () and f ( or ) is preserved. Thus "warg" from Old Norse "vargr", but "åvå" from Old Norse "hafa".
In the alphabets of most modern Romance languages (excepting far northern French and Walloon), is used mostly in foreign names and words recently borrowed (le week-end, il watt, el kiwi). The digraph is used for in native French words; is or . In Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, is a non-syllabic variant of , spelled .
In Indonesian, the letter "W" is called 'wé'. The letter names in Indonesian are always the same with the sounds they produce, especially the consonants.
The Japanese language uses "W", pronounced /daburu/, as an ideogram meaning "double". It is also used in internet slang to indicate laughter (like LOL), derived from the word warau (笑う, meaning "to laugh").
In Italian, while the letter is not considered part of the standard Italian alphabet, the character is often used in place of Viva (hooray for...), generally in the form in which the branches of the Vs cross in the middle, at least in handwriting (in fact it could be considered a monogram). The same symbol written upside down indicates abbasso (down with...)
In the Kokborok language, represents the open-mid back rounded vowel .
In Turkey the use of the w was banned between 1928 and 2013 which was a problem for the Kurdish population in Turkey as the w was a letter of the Kurdish alphabet. The use of the letter w in the word Newroz, the Kurdish new year was forbidden and names which included the letter were not able to be used. In 2008, a court in Gaziantep reasoned the use of the letter w would incite civil unrest. Nevertheless, the w was used in water closets throughout Turkey.
In Vietnamese, is called , from the French . It is not included in the standard Vietnamese alphabet, but it is often used as a substitute for qu- in literary dialect and very informal writing. It's also commonly used for abbreviating Ư in formal documents, for example Trung Ương is abbreviated as TW even in official documents and document ID number
"W" is the 24th letter in the Modern Filipino Alphabet and has its English name. However, in the old Filipino alphabet, Abakada, it was the 19th letter and had the name "wah".<ref>"W, w, pronounced: wah". English, Leo James Tagalog-English Dictionary. 1990., page 1556.</ref>
In Washo, lower-case represents a typical sound, while upper-case represents a voiceless w sound, like the difference between English weather and whether for those who maintain the distinction.
Under the 2020 version of amendment of Kazakh alphabets by president Tokayev, the W has selected as replacement of Cyrillic У, and represents one of , and/or .
Other systems
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, is used for the voiced labial-velar approximant.
Other uses
W is the symbol for the chemical element tungsten, after its German (and alternative English) name, . It is also the SI symbol for the watt, the standard unit of power. It is also often used as a variable in mathematics, especially to represent a complex number or a vector.
Name
Double-u, whose name reflects stages in the letter's evolution when it was considered two of the same letter, a double U, is the only modern English letter whose name has more than one syllable. It is also the only English letter whose name is not pronounced with any of the sounds that the letter typically makes in words, with the exception of H for some speakers.
Some speakers shorten the name "double u" into "dub-u" or just "dub"; for example, University of Wisconsin, University of Washington, University of Wyoming, University of Waterloo, University of the Western Cape and University of Western Australia are all known colloquially as "U Dub", and the automobile company Volkswagen, abbreviated "VW", is sometimes pronounced "V-Dub". The fact that many website URLs require a "www." prefix has been influential in promoting these shortened pronunciations.
In other Germanic languages, including German (but not Dutch, in which it is pronounced wé), its name is similar to that of English V. In many languages, its name literally means "double v": Portuguese duplo vê, Spanish doble ve (though it can be spelled uve doble),In Latin American Spanish, it is doble ve, similar regional variations exist in other Spanish-speaking countries. French double vé, Icelandic tvöfalt vaff, Czech dvojité vé, Estonian kaksisvee, Finnish kaksois-vee, etc.
Former U.S. president George W. Bush was given the nickname "Dubya" after the colloquial pronunciation of his middle initial in Texas, where he spent much of his childhood.

Umuanigo is a kindred in Owellemba Village in Umana Ndiuno, which is in Ezeagu LGA of Enugu State in eastern Nigeria. Umuanigo has five major families: Umu-Ndida, Umu-Eze, Umu-Aboshi, Umu-Ngwu and Umu-Ani. These families are believed to be the descendants of a man who has five sons and went on to have their own families. These five major families are known as Umuanigo. Today, people from Umuanigo still keep trace of their roots and each individual knows which of the 5 families they belong to.
History
The use of the word "Umu", which means "children of" in English, make it possible for one from Umuanigo to be able to trace one's family lineage.
The modern Umu-Ani have 5 families these are Aniakor, Mgbachi, Nweke, Ozoaham and Ozoanikwe. These five families expanded to 11 families and are still expanding. The same pattern of family expansion in Umu-Ani also took place in Umu-Ndida, Umu-Eze, Umu-Aboshi and Umu-Ngwu, making Umuanigo one big family that has different races and tribes being married into the family. Today, the new generation of Umuanigo has children born of mix culture, nationality and race.
The people of Umuanigo still recognize the fact that they are one big family; their internal problems are resolved within the family. They do not marry each other as they consider themselves as brothers and sisters.

Matthäus Prätorius (c.1635–c.1704) was a Protestant pastor, later a Roman Catholic priest, a historian and ethnographer.
Prätorius is thought to have been born in Memel (Klaipėda). He probably grew up speaking both German and Lithuanian, which helped him when preaching to the ethnic Lithuanians in Ducal Prussia. His work about Prussia and its culture, Deliciae Prussicae, oder Preussische Schaubühne, resembles the work of Christoph Hartknoch, with whom he collaborated. Prätorius' work provides much more ethnographic information regarding local Lithuanians and Old Prussians. It was only published partially, in 1725 (in Erleutertes Preußen), 1731 (in Acta Borussica) and 1871. A complete edition, in seven volumes, with original German text and Lithuanian translation, is under preparation in Lithuania.
In 1701, having converted from Protestantism to Roman Catholicism, he appealed against an ongoing case of witch-hunt. He died in Wejherowo (Weyherststadt).
In Orbis Gothicus and Mars Gothicus sustained that Prussia was the original land of Goths and that Goths can be identified as being "prussians, lithuanians, samogitians and curonians [latvians]".

Australian trust law is the law of trusts as it is applied in Australia. It is derived from, and largely continues to follow English trust law, as modified by state and federal legislation. A number of unique features of Australian trust law arise from interactions with the Australian systems of company law, family law and taxation.
General law of trusts
A trust is a three-party fiduciary relationship in which the first party, the trustor or settlor, transfers ("settles") property (often but not necessarily a sum of money) upon the second party (the trustee) for the benefit of the third party, the beneficiary. This trustee relationship may arise as a result of the trustee entering into an agreement with the settlor (commonly in the form of a trust deed) (also called an inter vivos trust), as a result of a testamentary trust or as a result of the operation of law as a constructive trust or resulting trust. In each case, the trustee holds the legal title to the property but is obliged to act in accordance with the provisions of the deed or will and generally for the benefit of the beneficiaries, and not the settlor.
The word trust specifically refers to the duty or aggregate accumulation of obligation that rest upon a person described as the trustees. The responsibilities of trustees are in relation to property held by them, or under their control. The trustees will be compelled by a court in its equitable jurisdiction to administer trust property in the manner lawfully prescribed by the trust instrument, or where there be no specific provision written or oral, or to the extent that such provision is invalid or lacking, in accordance with equitable principles.
A trustee has a legal interest in the property of the trust. The beneficiary has an equitable interest. If a person holds both the legal interest and the equitable interest, then the equitable interest will cease to exist and a single legal estate will subsist. See also: Stickney v. Keeble [1915] AC 386 Swarb Law UK
Equity recognises cases where a party places trust/confidence in another, these relationships are protected by equity and are called fiduciary relationships. The critical feature of fiduciary relationships is that the trustee undertakes to act for or on behalf of the beneficiary in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interest of the trustee in a legal or practical sense. In the exercise of a fiduciary duty, a trustee must not take a benefit from their position as trustee unless the beneficiary or beneficiaries have given their informed consent.
Common trusts
Express trust
In an express trust, the settlor indicates an intention to and deliberately creates the trust, while a non-express trust is one that arises by operation of law, such as when created by statute or by judges, such as a constructive trust.
An express trust may be an public express trust such as one for a charitable purpose, or a private express trust with the private purpose.
Classification of trusts
There are a variety of trusts recognised and used in Australia, including unit trusts, discretionary trusts, hybrid trusts, and testamentary trusts.
Under a discretionary trust the share, if any, which each beneficiary is to receive is determined by the trustees. Therefore, the trustee has a discretion as to which beneficiary is to receive income or capital under the trust even if there is a duty for them to distribute the income. In addition, the trustees also have a discretion as to the amount that each beneficiary will receive. However, the beneficiary has no real right substantively.
Streaming a category of trust income to a particular beneficiary provides tax planning opportunities. For example, foreign tax credits can be best used by resident individual beneficiaries with high marginal tax rates and net capital gains can be best used by beneficiaries with carried forward capital losses, low-income beneficiaries with carried forward revenue losses and minors able to receive excepted trust income. However, discretionary trusts are usually unsuitable for the accumulation of profits as the undistributed income will generally be taxed at 45%.
Family trusts are often used to distribute income to beneficiaries in an attempt to achieve the lowest tax outcomes available to the members of the trust. Discretionary trusts also protect assets when individual members become insolvent or bankrupt. Asset protection is also extended to other types of liabilities.
The power of appointment of the trustee of a discretionary trust is held by the Appointor. In some trust deeds, the person holding the power of appointment of the trustee is called the Custodian or the Principal of the trust. The Appointor is usually a natural person but can also be a company. Generally, upon the death of the Appointor, in the absence of an alternate appointment in the trust deed, the personal legal representative (executor) of the Appointor becomes the Appointor. The real power in relation to the control of the trust rests with the Appointor because of the ability to terminate the appointment of the trustee and appoint a different trustee. This must be kept in mind when considering succession and estate planning involving assets held in a discretionary trust.
Bare trust
A bare trust is a basic trust in which trust assets are held in the name of a trustee but the beneficiary, if he or she is above 18 years of age, has the absolute right to the capital, assets and income of the trust. The trustee has no say in how or when the trust's capital or income is distributed and must act according to the beneficiary's instructions. Bare trusts may be established because they offer tax advantages to the settlor or beneficiary and may arise when all conditions to which a beneficiary is subject (such as age) have been satisfied.
Creating a trust
A trust can be intentionally created during the settlor's life (inter Vivos) by declaration or transfer. A deceased estate is a testamentary trust which automatically arises on the death of the testator. Courts may also create trusts, such as constructive trusts, as an equitable remedy.
Declaration of trust
A settlor can declare him/herself trustee of his/her own property. The settlor already holds title to the property and all that needs to be done is to make a valid declaration. However, a declaration of trust will not be allowed out of an invalid gift.
Formalities relevant depend on nature of trust property. A trust of land must comply with statutory requirements based on the Statute of Frauds 1677.
Where the trust is created by virtue of a contract made as consideration for marriage, or a contact which concerns any interests in land, s 4 of the Statute of Frauds (or their equivalent legislation in other states) may operate to void such a contract unless it is evidenced in writing and signed by both parties to be charged.
Trusts created by transfer
A settlor can create an express trust by transferring property to a trustee to hold on trust. Two requirements must be satisfied:
declaration of trust, which must establish that the recipient of the property is intended to take the property in the capacity of trustee and not beneficially. The words used by the settlor will be construed in the context of the transfer itself.
there must be a valid transfer of trust property following the principle set out in Corin v Patton which held a transfer may be valid in equity even though it may not be considered valid at law. A transfer will be considered valid in equity only when the settlor has done all the things that must be done to transfer their interest in the property. The things required to be done by the settlor cannot be done by anyone else.
Trusts of land created by transfer must be evidenced in writing, as required by provisions derived from the Statute of Frauds 1677. See also Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) s23C.
A trust that fails to meet the requirement to transfer property in writing will not be void, rather it will be unenforceable.
Trust income
The net income of a trust is determined in accordance with the trust deed, and a beneficiary's entitlement will depend on the trust deed and any discretion that the trustee has under the deed to allocate income between beneficiaries.
Generally, under Australian tax law, the net income of a trust (which may be different to that determined under the deed) is taxed in the hands of the beneficiaries (or the trustee on their behalf) based on their share of the trust's income (that is, the share to which they are 'presently entitled') regardless of when or whether the income is actually paid to them. A beneficiary is presently entitled to trust income for an income year where they have, by the end of that year, a present or immediate right to demand payment from the trustee, which is determined by the trust deed as well as any discretionary powers of the trustee.

This is a progressive list of men's association footballers who have held or co-held the world record for international caps, beginning with Billy MacKinnon, the only man to play in all of Scotland's first seven internationals.
Criteria
The criteria used by national FAs in considering a match as a full international were not historically fixed. Particularly for the early decades, and until more recently for FAs outside UEFA and CONMEBOL, counts of caps were often considered unreliable. RSSSF and IFFHS have spent much effort trying to produce definitive lists of full international matches, and corresponding data on players' international caps and goals. Using this data, the following records can be retrospectively produced. Note that, at the time, these records may not have been recognised.
One point of note is that early matches by the England Amateur side were played against the full national side of opponents. These matches are counted as full internationals by the IFFHS and the opposing FAs, though not by the (English) FA. This affects Vivian Woodward, who won 23 full caps and 30 amateur caps; the IFFHS considers him as the record-holder from 1909, when his total of 31 caps included 11 amateur matches.
Before 1977, the world record holder was always European, except when Ángel Romano narrowly overtook Imre Schlosser. After 1977, many sources, including FIFA and the Guinness Book of Records, reported later European cap records as world records. Subsequent validation of the caps claimed by Cha Bum-Kun, Hussein Saeed, Majed Abdullah, and Adnan Al Talyani has shown that, even stripping out ineligible matches, these players exceeded the contemporary European counts. Similarly, Hossam Hassan of Egypt was reported as having broken Lothar Matthäus' putative record of 150 caps in 2001.
In August 2021, four retired Malaysian internationals were retrospectively admitted to the FIFA Century Club, with Soh Chin Ann's 1984 appearance against North Yemen recognised as a record 195th cap, thereby annulling the putative record totals achieved in intervening decades by Cha, Saeed, Abdullah, Al Talyani, Claudio Suárez, Mohamed Al-Deayea, Ahmed Hassan, and Bader Al Mutawa.
On 14 June 2022, Bader Al-Mutawa surpassed Soh Chin Ann's record of 195 matches recognised by FIFA and he become the men's all-time record appearance holder with 196 caps.
The women's international cap record is 354, held by Kristine Lilly of the United States, who exceeded Soh's total with her 196th cap against Norway in the 2000 Algarve Cup.

Anna Katharina Seidel (1938 – September 29, 1991) was a German Sinologist who was regarded as an authority in the study of Taoism. During her 22 years at the Institut du Hobogirin of the Ecole Francaise d'Extreme-Orient in Kyoto, Seidel had become the centre of gravity for the many Western scholars of East Asian studies who ventured to the ancient Japanese capital to conduct research.
Early years
The youngest of three children, Seidel was born in Berlin, Germany, but spent most of her childhood in the southern city of Munich. During the Nazi era, her father, who was an aviation engineer, stood by her mother, who was descendant of a distinguished German-Jewish family; they illegally sheltered a Jewish friend at their home throughout the Second World War, risking a death penalty. Seidel's parents encouraged her to pursue intellectual interests from an early age. Having been trained in the fundamentals of Sinology at the University of Munich (1958–1960) and the University of Hamburg (1961), Seidel specialised in the study of Chinese religions in Paris, where she studied under two eminent expatriates, Austrian Maxime Kaltenmark and German Rolf A. Stein from 1961 to 1968. Her doctoral dissertation, La divinisation de Lao-tseu dans le taoisme des Han is regarded as a groundbreaking study in the field. In 1969, Seidel was elected into membership of the Ecole Francaise d'Extreme-Orient and despatched to Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan, where she lived until her death.
Research
Here her work was centered upon the compilation of the Hobogirin, a multivolume encyclopedic dictionary of Buddhism. She simultaneously had the opportunity to continue her own research on Taoism, becoming one of the world's leading experts in this subject. After a brief marriage to the Bostonian scholar Holmes Welch, with whom she co-edited Facets of Taoism (1979), Seidel devoted her life completely to her scholarship and to the Hobogirin Institute.
In 1978, she taught Chinese religion as a visiting professor at the University of Hawaii and at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1988; she repeatedly rejected lucrative offers from eminent American universities. In 1985, she started the bilingual journal Cahiers d'Extreme-Asie, which has since become established as an important publication in the study of East Asian religions. The stated purpose of the journal was to draw scholars in Europe, America, and East Asia closer together. Seidel's position in Kyoto put her in a unique position to serve as a link between the various geographic communities of scholars. She was an international scholar: German in her upbringing and cultural identity, French by citizenship and education, residing and working in Japan, and wooed by the English-speaking academic establishment.
Writing
Her published works communicated her thoughts with a clarity which she achieved by avoiding stylistic embellishments and by making no concessions to fashionable theoretical terminology. Seidel's viewpoint on Chinese religion as depicted in her article "Taoism" written for the 15th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica (1975), broke the orthodox mould. While her work was founded on early religious texts, which she subjected to the most rigorous philological scrutiny, her analysis of religion extended to all aspects of culture. She placed her main emphasis on religious practice in its historical context, rather than becoming entangled in doctrinal speculation. Seidel was an atheist and did not practise Taoism; despite this, she was noted for approaching religious phenomena with a high degree of empathy. Although Seidel did not undertake long-term systematic fieldwork on Chinese religion, she paid meticulous attention to contemporary religious phenomena, which she interpreted as a continuum with ancient textual traditions. She had a strongly comparative perspective on religion, and consistently observed and recorded the religious landscape wherever she traveled. Her important collections of documents remain in the keeping of the Hobogirin Institute.
Seidel died before writing a major synthesis of her research field, though there were some initial attempts in such a direction (the booklet Taoismus, Die inoffizielle Hochreligion Chinas and her magisterial Chronicle of Taoist Studies in the West, 1950-1990). Her work remained unfinished at the time of her death.

is a two-part original video animation based on the video game series of the same name. Released in 1996, the film is based primarily on the events of Battle Arena Toshinden 2, but incorporates elements from the first and third games in the series.
Plot
Part 1
In the final round of the Battle Arena Toshinden tournament, Eiji Shinjo faces the tournament's sponsor, Gaia, in a final duel. Gaia mentions that Eiji's skills are comparable to those of his long-lost brother, Sho, but before he can explain, the fight is interrupted by a man called Chaos, who works for the same Organization as Gaia and has been sent to eliminate him upon discovering that Gaia is rallying fighters to overthrow the Organization. Gaia slays Chaos and flees, leaving the tournament without a winner.
A year later, both Sho and Chaos, the latter having apparently survived his fight with Gaia, working for the Organization's leader, Lady Uranus, begin hunting down the fighters from the tournament, such as Fo Fai, Rungo Iron and Mondo. Eiji, along with his best friend Kayin Amoh, split up to warn the other competitors. Eiji meets up with Sofia, an amnesiac agent and personal friend of his, and explains the situation to her. That night, however, Uranus takes control of Sofia's mind and has her try to kill Eiji, but Eiji fights back and breaks Uranus's hold on her. Sho himself then appears and does battle with Eiji, quickly gaining the upper hand, but Eiji discovers that Sho is actually a machine and overpowers him. Uranus appears and destroys Sho, goading Eiji before taking her leave. Enraged, Eiji vows to take Uranus and the Organization down.
Part 2
Eiji and Kayin meet up with another competitor, Ellis, and warn her of the danger. Believing she may be slain, Eiji and Kayin set a trap for Chaos and surprise him when he arrives. Gaia appears and fights Chaos again, and in the process, Ellis deduces from Gaia's pendant that Gaia is her long-lost father. Chaos blinds Gaia with gas and aims poison-tipped darts at him, but Ellis jumps in the way and is poisoned. Chaos smugly informs them that only the Organization has the antidote and flees back to the base, knowing that Gaia will likely seek him and Uranus out in revenge. After Ellis is hospitalised, Eiji, Kayin, Gaia and Sofia, with help from a policewoman, Tracy, launch an all-out assault on Uranus's base, aided by Rungo, Fo, Mondo and Duke, the other fighters from the tournament. Gaia locates and fights Chaos again while Eiji finds and destroys the facility where the copies of Sho are being created. Eiji and Kayin aid Gaia and eventually destroy Chaos once and for all. They confront Uranus in the throne room, where Uranus tells them that the facility was only a decoy, and the true one is beneath the base. The real Sho appears and defies Uranus, informing her that he has destroyed the real facility, which has caused the base to start collapsing. After swearing revenge, Uranus flees. Eiji, Kayin and Gaia make it out of the base before it explodes, but Sho is nowhere to be found.
The participants part ways on good terms. In a secluded area, Sho, who also survived, silently compliments his brother's improved skills. Meanwhile, Eiji and Kayin deliver the antidote to Ellis and she makes a full recovery. As Eiji walks home, he is confronted by a mysterious, gun-wielding warrior, Vermillion, and the film ends as they prepare to fight.

Appeasing Hitler: Chamberlain, Churchill and the Road to War, is a 2019 book by Tim Bouverie about the British policy of appeasement of Hitler in the 1930s.
Bouverie explains the policy as a product of the British response to the First World War. Given that an enormous percentage of Britain's fighting-age men had died in a war the purpose of which no one could perceive, Bouverie describes British pacifism as the explanation of Chamberlain's appeasement policy, since "The desire to avoid a Second World War was perhaps the most understandable and universal wish in history." Bouverie describes the antisemitism of the British ruling class as the secondary cause of Britain's reluctance to stand up to Hitler.
The book is a strong response to a number of recent works of historical revisionism that have painted Chamberlain as a "super-pragmatist", much maligned in view of the fact that his options were limited by widespread popular pacifism and also painting him as a man who cleverly used appeasement to gain time that would enable Britain to rearm.

Eudora is an email client that was used on the classic macOS, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows operating systems. It also supported several palmtop computing platforms, including Newton and the Palm OS. In 2018, after being years out of print, the software was open-sourced by the Computer History Museum.
History
Eudora was developed in 1988 by Steve Dorner, who worked at the Computer Services Organization of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The software was named after American author Eudora Welty, because of her short story "Why I Live at the P.O."; Dorner rearranged the title to form the slogan "Bringing the P.O. to Where You Live" for his software. Although he regretted naming it after the still-living author because he thought doing so was "presumptuous", Welty was reportedly "pleased and amused" by Dorner's tribute.
Eudora was acquired by Qualcomm in 1991. Originally distributed free of charge, Eudora was commercialized and offered as a Light (freeware) and Pro (commercial) product. Between 2003 and 2006 the full-featured Pro version was also available as a "Sponsored mode" (adware) distribution. In 2006 Qualcomm stopped development of the commercial version and sponsored the creation of a new open-source version based on Mozilla Thunderbird, code-named Penelope, later renamed to Eudora OSE. Development of the open-source version stopped in 2010 and was officially deprecated in 2013, with users advised to switch to the current version of Thunderbird.
Eudora (6.0.1) added support for Bayesian filtering of spam with a feature called SpamWatch. Eudora (6.2) added a scam watch feature that flags suspicious links within emails in an attempt to thwart phishing. Eudora (7.0) added ultra-fast search, which finds any emails using single or multiple criteria in seconds.
Eudora has support for "stationery", a standard message or reply prepared ahead of time to a common question. Eudora stores emails in a modified mbox format (*.mbx), which uses plain text files instead of a database as Microsoft Outlook does. This allows the user to back up portions of their email correspondence without backing up the entire database.
Eudora supports the POP3, IMAP and SMTP protocols. Eudora also has support for SSL and, in Windows, S/MIME authentication, allowing users to sign or encrypt email communications for greatest security.
Eudora is noteworthy for its extensive variety of settings to customize its behavior, many of which are not available in the user interface but are accessed using x-eudora-setting URIs that must be pasted into a message and clicked.
At one time, Eudora also offered a webmail service at eudoramail.com. This service was run by Lycos as part of Mailcity, later renamed Lycos Mail. In 2006, Eudoramail addresses for users were still working (and were redirected to Lycos Mail accounts), but new users could no longer sign up for the service.
Eudora for Windows never had any form of support for character encoding and was hardcoded to declare every email sent as encoded iso-8859-1, regardless of the actual content, and displayed every incoming email using the system encoding (one of the Windows encodings, depending on the language version of the system). This created problems for users corresponding in languages other than Western European ones and, later on, for everybody as UTF-8 became more and more popular. At least two third-party plugins exist that can convert characters that also exist in iso-8859-1, and it's also possible to run it with "Mime-proxy", but depending on a specific user's needs and due in part to the internal limitations of Eudora they may only offer a partial solution.
On May 22, 2018, after five years of discussion with Qualcomm, the Computer History Museum acquired full ownership of the source code, the Eudora trademarks, copyrights, and domain names. The transfer agreement from Qualcomm also allowed the Computer History Museum to publish the source code under the BSD open source license. The Eudora source code distributed by the Computer History Museum is the same except for the addition of the new license, sanitization of "bad words" found mostly in comment sections of the code and the removal of third-party software that neither the museum nor Qualcomm had the right to distribute.

Claus Emmeche (born 1956) is a Danish theoretical biologist and philosopher, one of founders of contemporary biosemiotics. He is associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, and is head of the Center for the Philosophy of Nature and Science Studies at the Faculty of Science (CPNSS, hosted by the Niels Bohr Institute).
His research interests are in philosophy of science, especially philosophy of biology, theoretical biology (especially morphogenesis and evolution, developmental systems, complex systems), artificial life, biosemiotics, and other areas within philosophy. He has made pioneering studies in the field of semiotics of friendship.
Activism
Claus Emmeche was one of the organizers of a petition directed at Helge Sander's education reforms, which the petition claimed undermined academic freedom by granting a broad majority of the management of universities to people from outside the academic community. As of August, 2008, 35% of Danish academics had signed the petition. By November, this figure had risen to about 50%.

Elmslie School was an independent girls' school in the English seaside resort of Blackpool, Lancashire, England, from 1918–2000. The school was established in a former house called the Elms, and later expanded into other buildings on the site. The Elms have been designated a Grade II listed building by English Heritage.
History
The Elms were originally the family home of William and Sarah Powell, built in 1896 to a design by T. P. Worthington. Elmslie School was founded in 1918 by sisters Elizabeth, Polly and Peggie Brodie. The school, called Ellerslie School, which occupied the former home of the Powell family, had just 11 pupils to start with; Elizabeth Brodie was the first headmistress. She remained headmistress until 1952. The school moved to the Elms in 1922 and changed its name to Elmslie Girls' School. In 1941, the school became a day school and by 1945 had 353 pupils. The Diocese of Blackburn's Board of Finance ran the school from 1948. In 1987 the school became an associated Woodard School. Elmslie closed in 2000.
On 15 March 1995 English Heritage designated the Elms a Grade II listed building.
Architecture
The Elms are a two-storey house built on an L-shaped plan, of red brick, with a sandstone front façade. There are three bays at the front, the left-hand of which is gabled. Both the left and right bays have small turrets on either side of the upper windows; the left turrets are topped with pinnacles, the right with crenellated caps. The central front entrance has a porch with marble columns. Internally, many of the building's original fittings are intact.
During the building's use as a school the following additions were made to the site: gymnasium and assembly hall (1938), more classrooms in the Fisher block (1952), a chapel (1959) and VI Form Centre and music rooms (1988).

Robert Neill Morris, known professionally as Colonel Robert Morris, (December 12, 1954 – October 21, 2013) was an American musician, drummer, singer and songwriter. He was also known as "The Man with the Golden Pen".
Morris was best known for playing drums for Charlie Feathers, and writing and performing the gold record "Trucker's Last Ride".
Early life
Robert Morris was born in 1954 in Whitehaven, Memphis, into a musical environment. His father was a "flat-top" guitarist and a musical associate of Bill Monroe. Monroe came often to visit the Morris family, which also influenced Robert early. Another of his father's acquaintances was Elvis Presley, with whom young Robert once spent a day boating on a nearby lake. His mother died when he was twelve years old.
Career
Morris started playing drums in Memphis clubs early and was connected to the Memphis blues and helped in creating the "Memphis Sound". During his Memphis Blues days he played with Eddie Bond, B.B. King, Rufus Thomas, Ma Rainey, Little Laura Dukes, Big Sam Clarke and many others. He played regularly at the Shanti Inn in Memphis. He also performed at the Eddie Bond Live Radio Show at the Western Steakhouse Lounge, also in Memphis. Later he played drums for Jerry Lee Lewis, Ronnie Milsap, Charlie Rich and nearly five years for Charlie Feathers. It also was the time when he recorded at Memphis' Sun Studios.
1980s
In 1988, the Finnish rock band Leningrad Cowboys produced their movie, Leningrad Cowboys Go America, which led them directly to Memphis, Tennessee. At this time Morris and his wife Irene owned the "Lonesome Bar" which was used for a scene in the movie. They both have a cameo role in that scene, though they were listed as Mr. and Mrs. Morris in the credits.
Also in the 1980s, Morris recorded material with Cordell Jackson on her own label. At the Memphis Fall Fest he also shared stage with a young Justin Timberlake, who sang Hank Williams songs wearing a cowboy hat.
Songwriting
In the 1990s, he seriously started to write songs when he heard about a story about the Doug Maten, a trucker who died of cancer. It was Maten's last wish to be taken to his grave in his rig. His co-workers fulfilled this dream and a convoy of one mile led him – lying on a flatbed trailer - to his grave. Morris was so touched of this story that he decided to write "Trucker's Last Ride". The song went gold and Morris was honored with the key to the City of Memphis and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Memphis Music Heritage Foundation for his merits.
In 1998, he received the honorary title of "Colonel aide-de-camp" from Don Sundquist, the then governor of the state of Tennessee. Since then he was known as Colonel Robert Morris or often just as "The Colonel". After that Morris was presented with The Mississippi State Governor's Award, Tennessee State Governor's Award and was inducted in the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Traditional Country Hall of Fame. He also is a regular inductee in the Who's Who in America.
2000s and death
In 2008, he published the trucking album, Highway Hero, on his own label, which also contains his song "Trucker's Last Ride". On August 24–25, 2013, he finally shot a music video for "Trucker's Last Ride". The music video was published online two months later on CMT / MTV and YouTube.
TM Garret, who worked with Morris since 2004, took over his legacy and his independent label Silver Dollar Music, and keeps working with songs and artists that have been discovered by Morris, such as Dani Fouts, who recorded his song "NASCAR Fan" and which charted at iTunes at number 26 the first week. The song was co-produced by TM Garret and former guitarist for Josh Turner and Clint Black, Bryan Austin.
Another Morris song that hit the market in 2014 was "Country Born, American Made", a song about Mark Muller, who starred in God, Guns & Automobiles on History Channel in 2013. The song was recorded by country artist Jimmy Miles for Mid South Music Records.
Death
Colonel Robert Morris died at October 21, 2013, at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Southaven, Mississippi, due to long-term effects of a heart attack he suffered in 2008.
He is survived by his wife Irene, his nephew Clifford and two sisters.

Dunfermline College of Physical Education, was a college for training teachers of physical education and hygiene in Scotland. The college was established in Dunfermline in 1905, moved to Aberdeen in 1950, and merged with Moray House College of Education, University of Edinburgh, in 1987.
History
Dunfermline
Dunfermline College of Physical Education was founded on 4 October 1905 as Dunfermline College of Hygiene and Physical Training, following the Report of the Royal Commission on Physical Training in Scotland published two years previously in 1903. Funding for the college was provided by Andrew Carnegie, who had established a trust to promote the physical wellbeing of the children of his home town of Dunfermline. The college's first principal was Flora Ogston, daughter of Sir Alexander Ogston, Regius Professor of Surgery, University of Aberdeen, who had trained at Chelsea College of Physical Education from 1901 - 1903. Other staff at this time included Warden of the College Ethel Adair Roberts, a graduate of Martina Bergman-Österberg's Hampstead Physical Training College, and member of the Ling Association which established the rules of netball; Leila Rendel, co-founder of the Caldecott Community; and Evelyn Perry, who was appointed by the War Office as physical training instructor of HM Munitions Factory, Gretna in 1916. Ogston stepped down as principal in 1906 when she married and was replaced by Ethel Roberts. Roberts held the post of principal for two years until her own marriage in 1908, when she was replaced Mary Stewart Tait.
Ordinary Diplomas and Diplomas with Honours were awarded to students who completed the college's two-year course. The course included theoretical and practical aspects of physical education, anatomy and physiology, Pehr Henrik Ling's Swedish gymnastics, remedial massage and voice production. Holders of the Diploma were recognised as qualified teachers of Physical Education on condition that they had also undertaken the necessary teacher training.
Although it was established as a women's college, men were also admitted from 1908 onwards. In 1909 the college was recognised by the Scottish Education Department as a "central institution for the purpose of the Education (Scotland) Act of 1908", and became the central training institution for school medical officers throughout Scotland. Tait resigned as principal in 1910 and was replaced by interim principal M. L. Brailsford, until Dr A.T. Mackenzie was appointed in 1912.
When it was founded, the college had one gymnasium located at Canmore Street Baths in Dunfermline. In 1909 a new college building was designed by David Barclay of Glasgow architect firm, H & D Barclay. The foundation stone was laid at Inglis Street, Dunfermline, in 1912, with the new building opening in 1914. At this point the college was renamed Dunfermline College of Hygiene and Physical Education. Abbey Park House was acquired in 1905 as the college's first residential hostel for female students, followed by the British Linen Bank Agent's House on Canmore Street in 1919, and St Leonard's Hill mansion in 1931.
In 1921 the college became associated with the National Committee for the Training of Teachers in Scotland and in 1931 the organisation established a management committee to oversee the management of the college. A voluntary third year was added to the degree programme in 1928 and became compulsory the following year in 1929.
As a result of pressure on college resources and increased demand for male physical education teachers, male students, were transferred to the new Scottish School of Physical Education, which opened at Jordanhill College in Glasgow in 1931, and DCHPE reverted to training women only. Principal Mackenzie transferred to Jordanhill along with the male students in 1931 and Helen Drummond took up the post of principal of the women's college.
From 1939-46 the college temporarily moved to the Teachers' Training College in Aberdeen, as its buildings in Dunfermline were requisitioned by the Royal Navy during World War II.
Aberdeen
By 1950 the college had outgrown its site in Dunfermline so it transferred to Woolmanhill in Aberdeen, hostel premises were acquired at Queen's Road, Rubislaw and Kepplestone House. At this time the college changed its name to Dunfermline College of Physical Education, Aberdeen, and as it was no longer located in Dunfermline, the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust ended its connection with the institution.
Modern dance, education psychology, drama, art and music were added to the curriculum between 1950 and 1960. New games were also introduced including volleyball, badminton and basketball, swimming and athletics rose in prominence, and outdoor recreational sports including skiing, orienteering and golf became increasingly popular. From 1952 onwards students undertook a one-week outdoor education course led by Ben Humble at Glenmore Lodge in the Cairngorms, covering skiing, rock climbing, hillwalking, assailing and canoeing.
In 1956 Helen Drummond retired after holding the post of principal for twenty-five years, she was awarded the Order of the British Empire for services to Physical Education, and replaced as college principal by N. Blunden.
As the college grew it became increasingly difficult to accommodate the students and to provide facilities for games, therefore the college Governors agreed that a new location in Edinburgh should be sought.
Edinburgh
In 1966 the college moved to a new purpose build campus at Cramond in Edinburgh. The campus was intended to accommodate 80 day students and 200 residential students accommodated in three blocks named after the college's Aberdeen hostels; Queen's, Kepplestone and Rubislaw. The college buildings were designed by Sir Robert Matthew and included a teaching building with library, lecture theatre, science laboratory, art and music studios, tutorial and study rooms, and a gymnasium building with three gymnasia, swimming pool, assembly hall and dance studio. The campus also included outdoor hockey pitches, tennis courts, athletics track, jumping pits and netball courts. In 1987 the college merged with Moray House College of Education; and male students from Jordanhill College in Glasgow also joined the newly merged Scottish Centre for Physical Education, Movement and Leisure Studies (SCOPEMALS) at Moray House. Moray House merged with the University of Edinburgh in 1998 to become the university's School of Education, and in 2001 Cramond campus was closed and the school moved to St Leonards Land, Holyrood. In August 2019, the School of Education formally changed its name to Moray House School of Education and Sport.
Reputation and culture
Since its foundation, Dunfermline College was regarded as a national institution for teacher training, with students of a "distinctly better class in society than the ordinary teacher". Teaching physical education came to be regarded as a respectable career for women, with PE colleges attracting talented sportswomen and nurturing refined manners, poise and deportment. Ethel Adair, principal of the college 1906 - 1907, promoted "the Dunfermline mark" of decorum and respectable social standards. Dunfermline attracted sporting internationalists, as PE teaching was regarded as the occupation of choice at a time when it was difficult to make a living as a sportsperson.
The college operated a "mother and daughter" support system, with new first year students, the daughters, being nurtured by second year mothers. Each year group was known as a set. A commemorative year book was published for each set on the year of their graduation.
Uniform
Uniform was strictly adhered to, with students being required to wear different uniforms for different sports and subjects. From 1905, for games and dance, students wore a heavy navy pinafore with square velvet yoke and blue cotton blouse, for hockey the tunic was replaced by a grey tweed skirt, hostel wear was a pinafore dress with thin flannel shirt. By the 1950s the navy pinafore had been replaced by a royal blue romper suit which allowed more freedom of movement. Grey shorts and blue Aertex blouses were worn for games, and black leotards and striped skirts for dance. The college cloak was dark green with a purple lining.
The college brooch, awarded to students on graduation, features a spider and a lion rampant and bears the motto "Efforts are Successes" and the founding date of the college. In 1969 the college was granted Armorial Bearings of a shield featuring a tower representing the cities of Dunfermline, Aberdeen and Edinburgh, a leaping stag, representing flight and grace and lightning bolts, which symbolise movement and are also part of the Carnegie family crest.
Dunfermline College Old Students' Association
Dunfermline College Old Students' Association was founded in 1912 and is still extant. Its aim is to keep members in touch with each other and provide updates on the college and developments in physical education and teacher training. All former students of the college and graduates of the Bachelor of Education degree in PE from the Scottish Centre for Physical Education, Movement and Leisure Studies are eligible to join. The Association publishes an annual report and Set News Magazine, and organises regular reunions.
Archive
Archives of the college are held by the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Research Collections and University of Aberdeen Special Collections. In 2019, Body Language, a Wellcome Trust funded archive exhibition at University of Edinburgh Library explored the archives of Dunfermline College of Physical Education, Scottish Gymnastics, and choreographer and dance teacher Margaret Morris.

Santa Maria in Ripalta is a Renaissance-style, former church located in Via San Giuliano in Pistoia, region of Tuscany, Italy. The structure is under restoration.
History
The church derived its name from a gate in the city walls through which Uguccione della Faggiola tried to overcome Pistoia during a siege. It had been previously dedicated to San Giusto. The church once had a venerated processional crucifix carried in town in 1399 during the Bianchi processions, a popular religious revival. It was then moved to Sant'Andrea. In 1554, the adjacent Canon's residence housed monks that had fled from Montecatini Terme to escape capture by Piero Strozzi. In the 19th century, it was assigned to the Confraternita del Suffragio. In the 20th-century, it became property of the commune.
A Romanesque-era fresco depicting Christ Pantocrator has been uncovered during restoration. An inventory in 1853 listed the following artworks:
Enthroned Virgin with Various Saints, main altarpiece by Scalabrino (Giovanni Battista di Pietro di Stefano Volponi?)
St Francis of Paola, left altar, by unknown author.
Christ contemplates a cross, right altar, by unknown author.

Synopsis
Amminikutty (Ammini) and Raghavan are depicted as childhood friends who share everything. After they grow up, Raghavan moves to Madras (Chennai) to look for work, but returns home after a few months. Ammini is excited to see him. They meet and realize that they are in love. However, Thamphi also loves Ammini, who doesn't reciprocate Thamphi's feelings, so Thamphi tries to separate Ammini and Raghavan. One day, when Ammini comes back from Sarppakkavu, Thamphi tries to rape her. A witness rescues her. Thamphi then goes about saying that Ammini understands his feelings and everyone should accept their love. At first, Raghavan doesn't believe the story but eventually, his mother and relatives prevail upon him.
When Ammini realizes Thamphi has been lying, she goes to Raghavan's house. He avoids her and tells her never to see him again. Against his wishes, Raghavan's mother arranges his marriage to Murappennu Mallika. He is forced to marry. Afterwards, he beats his wife and abuses her verbally, forcing Mallika to go back to her parents. Ammini attempts suicide, but she is brought to elderly Dr Manuel whose saves her and asks her to marry him, but she doesn't accept because she still loves Raghavan.
Dr Manuel doesn't understand why she refused his proposal. Eventually, he marries her. After a few days, Raghavan sees Ammini in a hospital, finds out they are still in love and remember intimate moments from the past. Dr Manuel has lingering doubts about their relationship.
A few days later, Ammini finds out that she's pregnant. She knows that this is Raghavan's child and tells him. He tells her to trick Dr Manuel by saying it is his child. Ammini listens, but Dr Manuel knows that he is too old and cannot be the father. He says nothing about it. Ammini is afraid, and after nine months, she gives birth to a baby. Dr Manuel knows everything. Ammini realizes this and tries to confuse him by saying that this is his child. Dr Manuel states that his friend, Dr Ravi, told him that he could not be the child's father. Ammini's lies are exposed. After some time, she goes to Dr Manuel to apologize but finds him unconscious on the floor after he had consumed poison.
Raghavan's mother tells her son to patch up with Mallika as she truly loves him. Raghavan feels sorry and asks Mallika to forgive him. His mother sends him back to his new house.
Ammini, with the baby in hand, attempts suicide by lying on a railway track. Thamphi tries to stop her by saying that he loves Ammini more than anyone. He takes the baby. He steps backwards but when he turns around, Ammini is dead. He goes to Raghavan and hands him the baby, saying that Ammini is dead and that they must take care of the child. Raghavan refuses to look after the baby, but Thamphi explains he is this baby's father. Thamphi returns home.

In statistics, the Phillips–Perron test (named after Peter C. B. Phillips and Pierre Perron) is a unit root test. That is, it is used in time series analysis to test the null hypothesis that a time series is integrated of order 1. It builds on the Dickey–Fuller test of the null hypothesis in , where is the first difference operator. Like the augmented Dickey–Fuller test, the Phillips–Perron test addresses the issue that the process generating data for might have a higher order of autocorrelation than is admitted in the test equation—making endogenous and thus invalidating the Dickey–Fuller t-test. Whilst the augmented Dickey–Fuller test addresses this issue by introducing lags of as regressors in the test equation, the Phillips–Perron test makes a non-parametric correction to the t-test statistic. The test is robust with respect to unspecified autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in the disturbance process of the test equation.
Davidson and MacKinnon (2004) report that the Phillips–Perron test performs worse in finite samples than the augmented Dickey–Fuller test.

The rivière des Caps (in English: Capes River) is a tributary of the southern coast of the St. Lawrence River where it flows in front of the Les Pèlerins islands, in Saint-André. This river flows in the municipalities of Notre-Dame-du-Portage, Saint-Alexandre-de-Kamouraska and Saint-André, in the Kamouraska Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Bas-Saint-Laurent, in province of Quebec, in Canada.
Toponymy
According to the Commission de toponymie du Québec, the toponym "rivière des Caps" appears in a volume dated 1787. This toponym is linked to the rocky cape located on the east side of its confluence. This rocky cape and the Grosse Montagne (located near the confluence of the Fouquette River) were once used as landmarks in the sector for visual navigation.
The toponym “rivière des Caps” was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Nancy Donahue (born February 16, 1958) is an American fashion model and actress.
Career
She got her start in 1978 when her then boyfriend, who also was a part time model, suggested Nancy enters a model search contest. She beat out 200 contestants to win a contract with Mademoiselle magazine to do 10 covers.(A cover contract was unique in those days and unheard of now) When legendary photographer Patrick Demarchelier found out that she didn't have an agent, he notified Elite, who sent a representative to the studio and she was quickly signed. Donahue worked alongside some of the top international models of the 1980s, including Kim Alexis, Carol Alt, Gia Carangi, Janice Dickinson and Paulina Porizkova. Donahue's face was on the cover and the inside fashion editorial of countless fashion magazines including American Vogue, French Vogue, Vogue Italia, British Vogue, Italian Bazaar, Mademoiselle, Self, Redbook, Glamour and the New York Times and, more recently, More! magazine. Donahue was the face for Helena Rubenstein's beauty campaign in the UK and Virginia Slims in the USA.
Donahue often did the Paris collections for American Vogue along with Gia Carangi, Joan Severance and Kelly Le Brock. She also did some runway work in her early career for Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Perry Ellis in New York and Hong Kong. Donahue also did countless catalogs for Lord and Taylor, Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale's. She has worked with numerous photographers including Richard Avedon, Steven Miesel, Francesco Scavullo, Irving Penn, Steve Landis, Arthur Elgort, Denis Piel and Patrick Demarchelier.
Nancy co-authored ONE on ONE with her former husband, the fashion model, Jeff Aquilon, published by Simon & Schuster, a best-selling book about two people giving to each other physically and emotionally.
Donahue was the Pastry Chef at Bianco's Catering Company in Chelmsford, Massachusetts for the ten years where she won numerous awards for her pastry at different events.
Model mismanagement
Donahue hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons in 1995 when the head of Elite Model Management, John Casablancas, blamed her for recommending David Weil to her as an experienced money manager. Casablancas claimed that the recommendation from Donahue was so good that he never investigated Weil further, nor did he search into the background of his business partner, Peter Bucchieri. The two operated a firm, Star Capital, within Elite's offices and managed many of the model's financial portfolios. They were subsequently accused of mismanaging the funds. On September 21, 1997, Bucchieri, pleaded guilty to conspiring with Weil to sell fictitious Colorado real estate investments to the models. Bucchieri was sentenced to 33 months in prison. It was subsequently discovered that they had transferred many of the model's funds to their own bank accounts and used it to pay personal bills and make purchases, including a new Porsche. Donahue accepted no blame for the incident and claims that she also lost a considerable amount of money to Bucchieri and Weil.

Polioencephalomalacia (PEM), also referred to as cerebrocortical necrosis (CCN), is a neurological disease seen in ruminants that is caused by multiple factors, one of which is thiamine depletion in the body. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a key chemical in glucose metabolism that, when deficient, is most threatening to neurological activity. In addition to altered thiamine status, an association with high sulfur intake has been observed as a potential cause of PEM. Other toxic or metabolic diseases (eg, acute lead poisoning, sodium toxicosis/water deprivation) can result in PEM as well. Cattle, sheep, goat, and other ruminants that are diagnosed with PEM or pre-PEM suffer opisthotonus, cortical blindness, disoriented movement, and eventually fatality, if left untreated. Current data shows that the onset of PEM can range from birth to late adulthood.
Causes
Thiamine deficiency
Thiamine availability is controlled by the direct dietary consumption of thiamine. Thiamine availability is also regulated by thiaminases, which are enzymes that readily cleave thiamine molecules and inhibit essential thiamine-regulated pathways such as the metabolism of glucose. Ruminants have working rumen microbes that synthesize thiamine molecules for the body; therefore, ruminants do not need to ingest thiamine rich foods for thiamine. However, feed concentrates given to ruminants, specifically sheep and cattle, are often heavily stocked with thiaminases. The presence of thiaminases counter the production of thiamine by breaking them down, resulting in a futile cycle between rumen microbes and thiaminases. Eventually, when the rate of synthesis production can not exceed thiaminase intake, a state of thiamine deficiency will be reached. Thiaminase rich foods include different grains, fresh water fish, and ferns, all of which are often processed together to make feed concentrate.
Overconsumption of glucose
Since glucose metabolism is regulated by thiamine, the overconsumption of glucose can also result in thiamine inadequacy. When there is a sudden increase of glucose in the body, thiamine will be depleted so that thiamine is not available when the next round of glucose needs to be metabolized.
High sulfur intake
In light of recent research, high concentrations of sulfur intake have also been deemed responsible for PEM. Sulfur is necessary for the synthesis of important sulfur-containing amino acids and their contribution to the synthesis of different hormones, enzymes, and structural proteins. The ruminant diet, especially that of cattle, can be overly concentrated with sulfur. In ruminants, the same rumen microbes that generate thiamine molecules reduce sulfur into toxic sulfides. Among the sulfide toxins is hydrogen sulfide, a gas compound that will compete with oxygen to bind with red blood cells and eventually enter the brain to disrupt neural activity.
Clinical symptoms
Clinical signs of PEM are variable depending on the area of the cerebral cortex affected and may include head pressing, dullness, opisthotonos, central blindness, anorexia, muscle tremors, teeth grinding, trismus, salivation, drooling, convulsions, nystagmus, clonic convulsions, and recumbency. Early administration of thiamine may be curative, but if the lesion is more advanced, then surviving animals may remain partially blind and mentally dull.

Town also received the Green Prize in Public Education by the NEA for the program, which has prevented the emission of 1.5 million tons of carbon dioxide, and has since included over 150 schools worldwide.
In June 2019, Redmond High School won several awards in its participation in Microsoft's annual Hunt the Wumpus competition. One team took home the first place trophy for "Most Innovative.".

School spirit
Redmond High School's mascot is the Mustang, and the school colors are predominantly dark green and gold, though in most ceremonies and events black is also included. A customary tradition against the only real rival of RHS, Eastlake High School, is to completely wear black at the "Black Out" sporting events. Fan participation cheers are also a tradition at the games. A spectator 'wave', dubbed the 'Roller Coaster' and a group jump known as 'Truckin' are favorites.
Redmond High School Pep Band is organized yearly to play at home football and basketball games. Three students (one for football and two for basketball) are selected as Pep Band Directors, though only the football director is known as Drum Major. New and popular songs are added by request of the students and staff. The current fight song (2003-) is set to the Blazing Saddles theme, with lyrics written by band director Andy Robertson. The former fight song was set to the University of Wisconsin–Madison's fight song, On, Wisconsin!.
The school newspaper, The Blaze, is written by the Newspaper class and distributed in color. In 2014, a group of graduating seniors distributed a parody of The Blaze titled "The Laze" as a senior prank, facetiously emulating the newspaper's style and tendencies.
Campus
The Redmond High School campus is centered in one large building containing academic classrooms, a student cafeteria, a central courtyard, three gymnasiums, and a performing arts center. The B Wing extension, added in 2012, includes several additional classrooms. Several portable classrooms are also set up in close proximity to the main building.
For athletics, Redmond High School maintains Walter L. Seabloom field which accommodates both football and track & field events. The campus has two additional open grass fields, baseball and softball fields, and six tennis courts.
