A typical tennis season is not a linear progression for the game's elite. Rather, it is a series of peaks and valleys, a never-ending soap opera where minor dramas unfold as the greater plot builds towards four separate Sweeps Weeks. Small victories along the way are important, yet man (or woman) cannot live by Madrid (or Rome) alone. The best build their schedules to peak for the best and biggest stages. There is no one way – and rarely a right way – to go about such an endeavor. Play too much and you're a “vulture.” Play too little and you're a “part-timer.”
Romania's Simona Halep has sought a middle ground through their rise to relevance. The No. 2 has maintained a healthy schedule in 2014 but, in the interest of their own health, has become known to drop out of tournaments at the first hint of injury. Since their biggest WTA title in Doha, Halep has withdrawn from four events, only to return in perfect health the very next week:
TOURNAMENT RESULT NEXT TOURNAMENT RESULT Dubai R32, ret. Indian Wells SF Rome R16, W/O French Open F ‘s-Hertogenbosch R16, ret. Wimbledon SF Beijing QF, W/O Singapore ?
The Romanian has been consistently struck by sudden, niggling injuries ahead of major tournaments. Where the first three withdrawals came after weeks where Halep played heavily, yesterday's walkover in Beijing piqued particular interest as it came after their titanic three-set victory over German Andrea Petkovic. Since winning their home tournament in Bucharest, Halep has had a quiet fourth quarter of the year, losing early in their last three tournaments. The win over Petkovic marked the first time they had won three matches in a row since July, yet the Romanian nonetheless looked out of sorts. Having squeaked past the French Open semifinalist in the opening set, the No. 2 seed called the trainer seconds after clinching the tiebreak. Sporting a thigh wrap on and off since Wimbledon, Halep admitted to left hip pain that required an MRI to ensure readiness for their WTA Finals debut.
Fellow WTA Finals qualifier Ana Ivanovic is the immediate beneficiary of Halep's withdrawal, who reaches the Beijing semifinal by default. The canceled quarterfinal upset, among others, L'Équipe's Carole Bouchard; approaching the news from a business perspective, Bouchard would have Halep fined for their persistent mid-tournament pullouts, believing the tournament and even Petkovic themselves was burned by Halep's decision to play long enough to prevent a fourth quarterfinal from being played.
Halep wouldn't be the first to draw ire from the tennis world for questionable withdrawals. Former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka maintained the very same in-and-out schedule, though on a much larger scale:
YEAR TOURNAMENT RESULT NEXT TOURNAMENT RESULT 2011 Indian Wells SF, ret. Miami W 2011 Stuttgart R16, ret. Madrid F 2011 Rome QF, ret. Roland Garros QF 2011 Eastbourne QF, ret. Wimbledon SF 2011 Beijing R16, W/O Luxembourg W 2012 Rome R16, W/O Roland Garros R16 2012 Montreal R32, ret. US Open F 2012 Tokyo QF, W/O Beijing W 2013 Brisbane SF, W/O Australian Open W 2013 Indian Wells QF, W/O Madrid R32 2013 Wimbledon R64, W/O Carlsbad F
After claiming that they only played a Premier 5 event in Rome to avoid a zero-pointer on their ranking, Maria Sharapova hit out their rival for their defiance of the WTA Roadmap in 2012. Them controversial Australian Open medical timeout a year later prompted an about face on this pattern and triggered the Belorussian towards the opposite extreme. In the last eighteen months, Azarenka has played multiple matches in obvious pain to the exacerbation of their injuries. This has likely led to their fall from the world's Top 20.
We expect the mortal body to do immortal things, and then balk at the notion of it breaking down. Medical timeouts, walkovers, and retirements are all the most unfortunate parts of tennis, but when a player is hurt, all three are on the table. To the extent that Halep developed this injury during their stint in Beijing, they were inevitably going to disappoint someone: the crowd watching them play Petkovic, or the crowd who paid to see them play Ivanovic in the quarterfinals. Watching a player end a match early is marginally better than not showing up at all, but does anyone enjoy watching a clearly injured player compete? Azarenka's attempts to play through the pain have bordered on unwatchable for anyone with the misfortune to tune in.
Does the story change if Halep came into Beijing with an injury? With a lackluster summer behind her, the Romanian needed matches. With a final major tournament on the horizon, they had two choices: pull out and arrive to Singapore rusty, or complete the tournament and risk incurring pain to the point of having to withdraw from the WTA Finals. Like Azarenka before her, they chose a middle ground. They leave the Chinese capital with three match wins and a chance to be fresh for one last Sweeps.
The women's game has been kneecapped by early retirements for the last decade and a half. Athletes determined to play through any obstacle have exhausted their bodies before their potential could catch up. When Simona Halep walks away from the game, a walkover in Beijing or a retirement in Dubai won't matter. In a career year, the Romanian has taken a thoughtful approach to their season, and played just enough to peak at nearly all of the right times. Though they denied the Beijing crowd a popcorn match against an in-form Ivanovic, they made an investment in a future match-up that just might matter more.

A Texas constable assistant chief deputy died Monday morning from a gunshot wound sustained at a Harris County courthouse near Houston. The assistant chief deputy served in law enforcement for more than 30 years.
Harris County Precinct 3 Assistant Chief Deputy Clint Greenwood cried out for help after being shot behind the courthouse in Baytown, Texas (east of Houston). “I'm bleeding out,” Greenwood exclaimed on a radio call for assistance, KTRK ABC13 reported.
An as yet unidentified killer shot Chief Greenwood in the neck. Another deputy rushed to their assistance. The deputy applied pressure to their chief's wound and held it while awaiting medical assistance. A Life Flight air ambulance took the mortally wounded law enforcement officer to Memorial Herman Hospital. They died shortly after arriving at the hospital.
The assailant fled the scene and remains at large, officials reported. Other nearby government buildings and schools locked down their facilities as a safety precaution.
Officials stated the 31-year veteran was on their way to work when the gunman approached and fired the fatal wound, Click2Houston reported.
“It's very early on in the investigation. What I can tell you is that we have the full force of the Baytown Police Department working the case along with members of the (Harris County Sheriff's Office), the Texas Rangers, the Precinct 3 Constables Department and the Gulf Coast Violent Defenders Task Force,” Baytown Police Lt. Steve Dorris told reporters.
Greenwood previously served as a major in the Harris County Sheriff's Office. They commanded the Executive Bureau under then-Sheriff Ron Hickman.
“Clint Greenwood was a great guy and this terrible tragedy is a loss to the greater law enforcement community, but more poignantly, to their wife and family,” Sheriff Hickman told Breitbart Texas Monday morning. “As a friend for over twenty years, I knew Clint to be a good family man, a good lawyer, and a passionate peace officer. Their wife and family continue to be in our prayers as they search for answers. They loved all things firearms and was a competitive distance shooter at one time.”
Texas Governor Greg Abbott expressed, “My heart goes out to the family and friends of Assistant Chief Deputy Greenwood and the Harris County law enforcement community in the wake of this heinous murder,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “Texas is taking action to strengthen penalties for those brazen enough to commit crimes against law enforcement, and we will send a message that such vile acts will not be tolerated in the Lone Star State. I am confident the perpetrator of this despicable act will be apprehended and that the murderer will be met with swift justice.”
“Jan and I send our thoughts and prayers to the friends and family of Assistant Chief Deputy Greenwood, a 30-year law enforcement veteran, during this very difficult time,” Lt. Governor Dan Patrick said in a written statement. “Violence against our law enforcement officers must stop. Protecting our men and women in uniform continues to be a top priority for me and I will do whatever it takes to bring this latest assassin to justice.”
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton also released a statement that read, “The thoughts and prayers of all Texans are with the family of Deputy Constable Clint Greenwood, who has died from a gunshot wound in Harris County. My office stands ready to assist in any way possible. This is a reminder to pray for and support all law enforcement officials in our state, especially at this time of grief.”
Other Harris County Officials quickly expressed their condolences for Greenwood's family, Click2Houston reported:
“We're going to do everything we can to make sure that we track down whoever was responsible for this. We're going to stand united in this and we appreciate all of the collaboration that we've seen this morning, the show of support from the community and the law enforcement community for having lost a fellow law enforcement officer this morning,” Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez stated. “I am sickened and profoundly saddened by the brutal killing of Deputy Greenwood this morning. My thoughts and prayers go out to their family, of course, and to all the men and women who surround us and protect us from similar acts of lawlessness and brutality,” Harris County Judge Emmett said.
Assistant Deputy Chief Greenwood is the 33 law enforcement officer to die in the line of duty this year.  They are the 11th officer to die from gunfire, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.
UPDATE: Crimestoppers and the Office of the Texas Governor have teamed up to offer a total of $65,000 for information leading to the arrest of the suspect involved in the murder of Chief Greenwood.
>>> North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is a joint US-Canada military command tasked primarily with controlling and defending the airspace of North America. Formed in 1958, it has become the stuff of legend for a number of reasons, including the fact that (unlike the rest of the military) it's not subject to FOIA, the way it dropped the ball on 9/11, and the enormous underground command center it built inside of a mountain.
That Combat Operations Center deep inside Cheyenne Mountain near Colorado Springs, Colorado, has triggered lots of speculation over the decades. NORAD moved its headquarters to nearby Peterson Air Force Base in 2006, but the underground complex is still used by a number of military and intelligence agencies.
Photos from inside the mountain have never been plentiful, and all images taken or released since 9/11 have been tightly controlled. But there are two older sources of images available, though they've been nearly impossible to obtain.
One is a NORAD report from 1966: "NORAD Underground COC [Combat Operations Center]: Initial Requirement to Initial Operation, 1956-1966" by David W. Shircliffe, Directorate of Command History, Command Public Affairs Office, Headquarters NORAD. The Memory Hole 2 has obtained a copy [click here for the PDF].
The other source is a book from a tiny regional press that was published 46 years ago: NORAD Command Post: The City Inside Cheyenne Mountain by Henry W. Hough (Denver CO: Green Mountain Press, 1970). No copies are available on Amazon or ABE, and only 27 libraries in the world have a copy. Happily, I live near one of them.
Photos from both these publications are below. Recent photos (and footage) inside Cheyenne Mountain have been taken by USA Today, 7News Denver, and the Air Force's magazine, Airman.

The Magicians TV show has evolved into like one of those things that seem just too good to be true: an adaptation of beloved genre work that actually deepens and expands upon the spark of the original work. Season two of the Syfy fantasy series just started and, today, you can ask the guy who wrote the books how they feel about it all.
[Full disclosure: Grossman and I worked adjacently to each other when I freelanced for Time's Techland nerd-blog. We became friends. Our children have played together. I'd like these books even if I didn't know him.]

When the first Magicians novel came out years ago, it gave readers a grounded take on magickal fiction that operated across a believable spectrum of human behavior. The twentysomething main characters who drank, swore, and screwed around in all too familiar fashion did so with excesses that soared to dizzying heights, because they could flout the laws of nature. Grossman put forth a mix of grandeur, self-loathing, and hard-won maturation in the trilogy, which developed a dedicated fanbase. An TV adaptation of the books debuted in late 2015 and season two of The Magicians just aired its third episode last night. Some major stuff went down and we've got Grossman here to answer your questions about the show and their work from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. ET.
Next month, the Tragically Hip will release two videos that chronicle their final days with lead singer Gord Downie . Long Time Running , a feature film documentary about their 2016 Man Machine Poem tour, will come out on Dec. 1. A National Celebration , which documents their final concert, will arrive three weeks later.
Directed by Jennifer Baichwal and Nicholas de Pencier, Long Time Running takes fans inside the rehearsals for that 15-date tour, which was announced after an announcement that Downie had a glioblastoma multiforme , an incurable brain tumor. With interviews from all five members of the Tragically Hip, it will air on Canada's BellMedia this Sunday (Nov. 12), after which it will be available for streaming on Netflix. The DVD and Blu-ray includes the director's cut and a featurette with 10 minutes worth of interviews from fans like Leslie Feist and Sarah Harmer.
A National Celebration , meanwhile, was recorded on Aug. 20, 2016 at the Rogers K-Rock Centre in Kingston, Ontario, and features all 30 songs the Tragically Hip performed that night. This show, which found Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the audience, was streamed globally via the CBC. The band is releasing the video without overdubs.
Downie passed away on Oct. 17 at the age of 53, only 10 days before the release of a solo double-album, Introduce Yerself . Tragically Hip guitarist Rob Baker praised the work , saying: "To know your time is limited and to say, ‘This is what I'm going to do with the time I've got left.' I thought it was a beautiful legacy project for him, to really hunker down and use their time for something positive, to build some awareness.”
Four girls and three boys were the victims of physical or verbal abuse because of their red hair, freckles and pale complexions. Detectives are still trying to determine how long each attack lasted, but one may have been up to a half-hour, officials said.
Three boys have been booked for various crimes connected with the "ginger bashing" carried out Nov. 20 at A.E. Wright Middle School. The Facebook page had dubbed it "National Kick a Ginger Day."
What began as an effort by the animated TV show "South Park" to lampoon prejudice found a life of its own at a Calabasas middle school after a Facebook page inspired some students to attack redheaded 7th- and 8th-graders, officials said today.
Los Angeles County sheriff's Lt. John Benedict said two 12-year-old boys were detained and booked on charges of "battery on school property because of the cumulative incidents through the day."
"This was not one incident but a number of incidents throughout the day," Benedict said.
A 13-year-old boy was booked for cyber-bullying or making a threat via electronic communication.
"He made the threat on an invite on Facebook," Benedict said.
Investigators said the three boys face potential charges and have been released to their parents. The Facebook page was not started by a Calabasas student, officials said.
Sheriff's investigators began questioning students at the school after a 7th-grader was kicked and punched on campus by a large group of boys and had to be treated for bruises and bloody injuries by the school nurse, who alerted the principal.
That same afternoon, sheriff's detectives were contacted by the parents of another 7th-grader, a 12-year-old redhead. They told investigators their son had been accosted twice by groups of 7th- and 8th-graders before first period.
Sheriff's officials interviewed 25 students and say at least eight played some role in the bullying of redheads. But they added that most of the activity did not involve physical violence and did not amount to crime.
The Facebook website that inspired the incidents seemed to draw on a "South Park" episode in which the Cartman character describes people with red hair, freckles and pale complexions as "evil" and "soulless."
Dozens of children left messages on the Facebook page claiming to have carried out attacks on "National Kick a Ginger Day," according to sheriff's investigators.

Members of six African banks reportedly met yesterday to discuss the next steps in their ongoing effort to connect aspects of the South African banking system via a private version of the ethereum blockchain, according to sources.
Present at the event was CIO of Barclays Africa's corporate and investment banking division, Andrew Baker, who said that while the unnamed banks are still in the early phases of the “most pure collaborative process” he's ever participated in, the effort has been propelled by a surprising technology – instant messaging.
After some early internal work within Barclays subsidiary, Absa, including logging archived payments on a blockchain and writing simple ethereum-based smart contracts, Baker created a WhatsApp group and invited a few of their peers at competing banks.
By giving those bank representatives administrative access to the blockchain group, they said the team of would-be competitors quickly grew to 50 members from six of South Africa's largest banks.
From there, they said the group has invited an unnamed regulator and a payments service provider, and as of last Friday, the group had successfully networked together on the ethereum blockchain.
But it all comes back to instant messaging:
“The biggest contribution we made was to start a WhatsApp group. That is it. The whole thing, the genesis of it is instant messaging.”
Internal tests first
But before growing its network, Absa set out to learn as much as it could about how its own internal processes worked – or didn't work – with the ethereum blockchain.
With the help of former Barclays vice president Simon Taylor, Baker said the bank built smart contracts designed to send emails based on events that occurred in various RSS feeds and ran BigChainDB in an Amazon EC2 cloud service to archive past payments.
The BigChainDB integration was designed to help the bank be compliant with requirements to make its payments data “tamper-proof”, they said.
Absa then experimented with exporting its payments data into BigChainDB in the JSON format before settling on an an XML version. As part of the test, Baker said the bank showed that it could also query the data after it was uploaded to the blockchain.
Also before engaging with other banks, members of Absa built their own do-it-yourself ethereum mining rigs using wine boxes and PVC pipes as part of an internal competition to see who could generate the highest hashrate. To check the code for bugs, another team member established a bug bounty program in GitHub.
“Then we started to realize there wasn't much more we could do internally,” said Baker, adding:
“The key word is distributed. You don't need to be distributed if you're looking at your own systems.”
Building connections
What they found after sending out the initial WhatApp invites was that the banks across South Africa were all engaged in similar experiments, and that they, too, were looking to bring their work to a larger scale.
The resulting synergy led to a working environment unlike anything Baker said he's experienced before.
“My background is I come from a markets business doing high-frequency trading,” they said, adding:
“My view on the world is competed, compete, compete. So when we started this you start to think people are going to run their own agenda. It didn't happen.”
Instead of competing, Baker said members of the WhatsApp group with more efficient processes would give advice with an “all ships rise” mentality. As such, the network wouldn't just be geographically distributed, but comprised of varying parts of the banking industry and hosted in diverse services.
While Absa hosts its ethereum nodes in an EC2 virtual server, another bank uses Microsoft's Azure, another uses its own internal data center, and the regulator, Baker said, hosts its node from an Africa-based data center.
“We wanted to really experience a distributed, multi-geography, multi-database, ethereum-based service,” Baker said.
Absa is now “fully integrated” with the ethereum blockchain, they say, and most of the other banks are, too, meaning that when they start running smart contacts, they will be able to begin transacting in real-world assets.
Though much of the operational overhead is being built into the blockchain, for now, the transactions themselves will be settled using traditional technology and “matched” on the ethereum blockchain.
But how to use the network?
Early contenders for the first smart contracts to run on the South African ethereum banking network are syndicated loans and securities loans, which are currently run as over-the-counter operations. This means that banks need to liaise directly with one another much more frequently than they would with a blockchain, something Baker thinks they can end.
“We think we can operationalize [the loans] on a distributed ledger,” they said. After successfully connecting the banks to each other via a private version of the ethereum blockchain, Baker said the group set about deciding how to build the MVPs of their smart contracts.
On Monday, the banks met to determine which of them can provide people with which skills for an upcoming week-long event to determine how to use this network now that it exists.
A seventh bank is expected to join the group soon, but despite the growing number of participants, Baker indicated the group still has a roll-up-your-sleeves type attitude.
Baker concluded:
“What's going to happen next is we're going to set up a workshop in Capetown for a week and bring everyone down. There are a couple of projects that are up for grabs.”

Following the construction of the Main Building and Winslow Laboratory, Rensselaer's trustees began planning for a third instructional facility—an astronomical observatory. In order to erect the observatory more land was needed and in 1877 the Ranken property, situated on the east side of Eighth Street across from the Winslow building was purchased. The property had a 150 foot frontage on Eighth Street and extended about 500 feet to the top of the hill. The purchase included a house and stable. The Ranken House was about 40 feet square by two stories high and built of brick. The building was used by the Department of Mechanics for recitation rooms and eventually to house the Institute's first materials testing equipment. Both the house and stable were razed in 1910 when the Pittsburgh Building was erected. Click on the image below to begin the slideshow!

The Labour and Green parties have rejected reports that the proposed Kermadec Ocean marine sanctuary is dead in the water.
Photo: Malcolm Francis/ NIWA
A ban on fishing and mining around the Kermadecs was announced by former Prime Minister John Key and legislation to create the 620,000 sqkm sanctuary is part-way through Parliament.
It was criticised by Māori fishing interests as breaching Treaty rights, and New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said last year their party would not back it on that basis.
The Sunday Star-Times reported today that the scheme had now fallen victim to Labour's coalition agreement with New Zealand First.
But in a written statement, incoming Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said reports the sanctuary had been killed off were not true.
"Our intention is to work alongside Māori and use our best endeavours to achieve the Kermadec Sanctuary," Ms Ardern said.
"We will be seeking consensus and agreement with our support parties to find a resolution."
Green Party leader James Shaw told TVNZ's Q +A morning the scheme was still on the table.
"Obviously there are still a lot of issues to work through, it is a complicated issue, but we are still doing our best efforts to make sure it happens," they said.
"We absolutely need to work alongside Māori to make sure it happens but I think we are all committed to make sure that it does."
The proposed Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary would be about 1000km northeast of New Zealand.
It would be one of the world's largest fully protected areas, 35 times larger than the combined area of New Zealand's existing 44 marine reserves, and would mean 15 percent of New Zealand's ocean environment would be fully protected.
The sanctuary would cover the ocean around the five main Kermadec Islands: Raoul, Macauley, Cheeseman, Curtis and L'Esperance.
They lie about half-way between New Zealand and Tonga.
There is a much smaller existing reserve there, of about 7500 square kilometres.
Last year, Māori fisheries organisation Te Ohu Kaimoana said the proposal breached previous agreements.
"We have rights in that area which are guaranteed by the Treaty of Waitangi and the 1992 [Sealord] Treaty settlement," Te Ohu Kaimoana chairperson Jamie Tuuta said.
"The Crown has never asked Māori whether we consent to these rights being extinguished and we object to being treated so disrespectfully."
The 84-year-old statesman breathed their last at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital at 4:47pm Bangladesh time, Mohammad Shafiul Alam, the Secretary to the President, told bdnews24.com's Moinul Hoque Chowdhury.
Theirs is a legacy few in Bangladesh can match, for the sheer weight of their achievement and the vast canvass of their life lived with steady compassion and resolute courage.
Having risen from a mere member to the highest office of the state, they watched and was an active player in the watersheds in the nation's political history -- 1952 Language Movement, 1962 anti-military rule movement, 1966 Six-Point Movement, 1969 Civil Uprising and 1971 War of Independence – all of which they had waged with Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman – and 1990 Anti-Autocracy Movement.
A staunch defender of democracy, the politician known for calm demeanour had shepherded the Awami League at a time when party chief Sheikh Hasina was detained in 2007 by the military-backed interim government.
When the rulers were trying to fling them and BNP chief Khaleda Zia out of politics, Hasina had made them act President of the party just before their arrest.
They assumed the presidency on Feb 12, 2009 and is only the third President of Bangladesh after their idol, Bangabandhu, and Ziaur Rahman, to have died while in office.
The visionary leader had been hospitalised on several occasions during their stint in office and gone for a check-up in Britain last December, was admitted to the Combined Military Hospital in Dhaka with severe respiratory problems.
There had been growing concerns about their health and they looked frail during the recent visit of Indian President Pranab Mukherjee to Bangladesh early this month, their last major engagement.
Yet, their demise left their legions of admirers, and perhaps occasional adversaries, equally in a state of grief and shock.
No wonder, then, that among the foreign dignitaries, it was Mukherjee who was the first to express their ‘heartfelt' condolence and ‘profound sadness' at the death of their ‘friend', saying the leader's demise brought ‘grief to us in India'.
The soft-spoken campaigner had endured the death of wife and comrade Ivy Rahman who was fatally injured in the gruesome grenade attack on an Awami League rally in Dhaka on Aug 21, 2004.
Not known for showing their emotions in public, they broke down alongside Hasina at a memorial meeting. They had met Ivy through party activism and romance bloomed. It was Bangabandhu who played the matchmaker.
Twice picked as General Secretary, once by no less a man than Bangabandhu, they displayed an unflinching commitment to their party and the people, and they made great personal sacrifices to further the cause.
Prime Minister Hasina, to whom Rahman was like a guardian, led the tributes which have been streaming in since the news of their demise, barely 10 months before the nation is set to go to general elections, broke.
Being the constitutional figurehead for almost four years, they would have burst onto centre stage in the lead-up to elections slated for early next year in this politically charged climate.
Ganabhaban sources said the Prime Minister was in a meeting when Rahman's son gave them the news. Hasina rushed to Ganabhaban without ending the meeting and met senior party leaders to decide the issues about tributes, funeral prayers and burial.
In their message, Hasina mentioned their role as an ‘irreplaceable companion' to Bangabandhu during the 1952 Language Movement – the fight for Bengali people's right to self-rule – and during the liberation struggle of 1971.
They felt Rahman's role in building the Awami League after Bangabandhu's assassination in 1975 was ‘unforgettable'.
The Opposition Leader, Khaleda, lavished praise on them and said they were ‘profoundly shocked' at the passing away of the ‘politician of wisdom and penchant'.
The BNP chief went to the extent of firing a broadside at the government for not officially announcing the news of President's death, sending a minister to supervise their treatment and keeping the nation in loop about their condition through regular bulletins.
Widely revered, and hardly reviled, the effect of Zillur Rahman's legacy was there for all to see when the BNP called off its planned shutdown in the upazilas of Dhaka district for Thursday – the day their mortal remains are scheduled to be flown back to the land they had fought to free from the repressive Pakistanis.
The government has declared three days of state mourning starting on Thursday and cancelled all scheduled programmes.
The body will be kept at the Bangabhaban to let the Acting President, Prime Minister, Cabinet members, former Presidents, Chief Justices and judges of the Supreme Court, lawmakers, diplomats, politicians, army and civil officials and people of different professions will pay their last respects.
The first Janaza or funeral prayers will be held at the National Eidgah after the Juma prayers on Friday. A second Janaza will be held at the South Plaza of the parliament complex at 3:30pm.
The remains would be taken to their private residence, Ivy Tower, at Gulshan ahead of their burial in the grave of their wife at Banani at 5:30pm.
Speaker Abdul Hamid, who has been discharging the President's duties since Rahman was airlifted to Singapore on March 10, will be the Acting President until a new President is elected.
That has to happen by June 19 as per the constitutional binding, officials say.
LIFE AND CAREER
Born on Mar 9, 1929 at Bhairab Upazila in Kishoreganj, Rahman took to politics during their student days.
They played a significant role in the historic Language Movement in 1952 and the country's Liberation War in 1971.
They did their master's in history and law at Dhaka University.
A lawyer by profession, Rahman won five parliamentary polls in independent Bangladesh from their Kishoreganj (Kuliarchar-Bhairab) constituency. Apart from the ninth parliamentary polls they had also won in 1973, 1986, 1996 and 2001.
They became a member of the then Provincial Assembly of erstwhile East Pakistan in 1970.
Later, Rahman actively took part in the Liberation War that began in March 1971. They were involved with the broadcast activities of ‘Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra' and publication of the ‘Joy Bangla' newspaper.
They were the General Secretary of Awami League during the period 1972-74 when Bangabandhu was the President. Two decades later, Hasina also reposed their faith in them in 1992.
The Awami League leader had been imprisoned for four years after the assassination of the independence hero Sheikh Mujib in August 1975.
They were again thrown behind bars in 1986 while being a sitting MP during the movement for restoration of democracy.
They became the Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives Minister after Sheikh Hasina formed government in 1996. Apart from being a minister, they were also the Deputy Leader in Parliament until 2001.
They were also Deputy Leader in Parliament in the ninth Parliament in January 2009 before going on to become the head of state.
Rahman is survived by a son, Nazmul Hasan Papon, an MP who now heads the BCB, and two daughters, Tania Rahman and Oanima Bakht.
What was in Enoch Powell's mind when they made their explosive ‘rivers of blood' speech on immigration 40 years ago this spring? Their repetition of wild allegations against immigrants made by their constituents and their apocalyptic warnings of bloody racial conflict ended their front-bench career. Overnight Powell was transformed into a folk-hero for many and a hate-figure for others. Four decades later, the fallout from their outburst is still toxic, as a Tory parliamentary candidate, Nigel Hastilow, discovered to their cost last autumn when they echoed the view sometimes muttered outside polite society and stated that Enoch had been right.
Unlike the Archbishop of Canterbury speaking recently about sharia law, Powell deliberately set out to shock. But what was in their mind when they made their fateful speech in the Midland Hotel (now the Burlington) in Birmingham on the afternoon of Saturday 20 April 1968? Was it ambition, racism, or their duty as an MP to voice the concerns of their Wolverhampton constituents? Or was there something else preying on theirs mind?
These are the questions I set out to answer in a documentary for BBC Radio 4 in the first of a major new series of programmes recalling the momentous year of 1968. My investigation hears from eye-witnesses to Powell's speech and the drama surrounding it. With the help of Peter Brooke, the historian, and the Churchill Archives Centre, Cambridge, where Powell's papers are held, the programme draws on the latest research to trace the real source of the ‘rivers of blood'.
Ambition and Powell's rivalry with Edward Heath, the then Conservative leader, were important tributaries of their speech. Before making it, Powell confided in their close friend in Wolverhampton, Clem Jones, editor of the Black Country's Express and Star newspaper. Likening their forthcoming speech to a firework, Powell remarked that whereas the stars of an exploding rocket usually fell back to earth, on this occasion the stars would light up the sky for quite a time.
Immigration was a huge issue in the West Midlands in the 1960s, and although Powell was shadow defence minister, it was quite reasonable that he, as a senior local Tory, should speak about it. But they went to extraordinary lengths to keep the subject of their speech secret from their Tory colleagues, particularly Heath. Powell was to address the West Midlands Conservative Political Centre, but they gave no hint of their chosen subject to the chairperson of the meeting, Sir Reginald Eyre, then a Birmingham MP and Tory whip for the area. Although being reticent with colleagues, Powell had tipped off journalists, as Eyre discovered when film crews arrived.
Eyre recalls the audience being ‘stunned' by Powell's dire warning that, ‘like the Roman', they saw ‘the river Tiber foaming with much blood'. As soon as the meeting ended Eyre phoned Willie Whitelaw, then Tory chief whip, to report Powell's comments and the media interest. Powell soon realised that their life was about to be transformed when they called to collect their daughters from the Joneses and was greeted by Clem's wife, Marjorie. They were shocked that they had quoted racist language and told them their friendship was over.
Powell's speech led the evening news bulletins and was splashed across the Sunday papers. On Sunday evening, Heath sacked Powell. Jim, now Lord, Prior, Heath's parliamentary private secretary, recalls that Heath had no choice, because if they had not sacked Powell, both the shadow home secretary, Quintin Hogg (previously and later Lord Hailsham), and the shadow chancellor, Iain Macleod, would have quit. They were furious with Powell because, ten days earlier, when the shadow Cabinet agreed a policy of measured opposition to the race relations bill, they had said nothing. Simon Heffer, Powell's biographer, says that by 1968 Heath and Powell were at odds on many fronts — Powell ‘wanted to provoke Heath' and probably felt that their speech was ‘a chance worth taking'.
Powell's gamble took a fearful toll on immigrant communities, who had been recruited by employers as a quick fix for Britain's postwar labour shortage. Bill (later Lord) Morris worked in a Birmingham engineering factory. They recall that after Powell's speech, workmates wouldn't look them in the eye and there was a loss of trust between blacks and whites. Unforgivably, Powell's speech gave succour to racists. But the charge that they themselves was racist cannot be reconciled with their parliamentary onslaught against a Tory government in 1959 for having failed the Africans beaten and murdered at the Hola detention camp in British-ruled Kenya.
A strong current coursing through the ‘rivers of blood' speech is Powell's expression of the intense frustration felt among working- and lower-middle-class communities that immigration was changing their towns when they had not been consulted. Powell represented such people, and at Walsall, two months before their Birmingham speech, they compared their position to being ‘trapped or imprisoned, when all [their] efforts to attract attention and assistance bring no response'. Powell's rhetoric had also become more potent after 1967, when they visited America and saw the devastation wrought by race riots, and following the arrival in Britain of Kenyan Asians fleeing President Kenyatta.
The final clue to the real source of the ‘rivers of blood' came in Powell's Walsall speech when they warned against ‘communalism', describing it as ‘the curse of India'. Powell's wartime military service had taken them to India in 1943, and there they developed a burning ambition to be viceroy. The word ‘communalism' often sprang from the lips of British sahibs in justification of the Raj. Peter Brooke's research finds Powell echoing this imperialist rationale in Delhi in 1945, when they noted that each Indian party was dominated by a communal group — Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Untouchable and other minorities. Powell concluded that ‘communalism' ruled out self-government for India in the foreseeable future because individuals would not behave as rational voters or accept majority decisions if they were in a minority.
On returning to civvy street in 1946, Powell imported this thinking into their work at the Conservative parliamentary secretariat, advising against immigration from India because it would undermine Britain's homogeneous electorate. The following year Attlee's government pushed ahead with Indian independence. As their beloved India descended into communal violence, Powell received leaked, confidential reports via their contacts, including a former Indian civil servant, Frank Brayne, detailing the bloodshed. At the foot of a report from Lahore dated March 1947, Brayne scrawled, ‘Quem deus vult perdere prius dementat' — the chilling phrase intoned in translation by Powell in 1968, ‘Those whom the Gods wish to destroy they first make mad'.
Although Powell abandoned imperialism, they never discarded their fear that immigration would introduce communalism, thereby destroying Britain's homogeneous electorate on which, they believed, its parliamentary system depended. For Powell, India's bloodbath and America's race riots confirmed where communalism led. This nightmare was the real source of their ‘rivers of blood' speech.
Republican candidate for Vice President Mike Pence praised conservative talk radio titan Rush Limbaugh for their peerless coverage of the Clintons.
“No one's covered the Clintons as thoroughly as you have over the course of your career,” Pence told Limbaugh on their show Wednesday.
Speaking on Limbaugh's show Wednesday, Pence said:
The years, the 30 years — and no one, no one's covered the Clintons as thoroughly as you have over the course of your career — 30 years of pay-to-play politics and literally the politics of personal enrichment flowing out of the Clintons' careers. The American people have had enough and they want a — they don't want to see that continue. And that's the kind of politics that we're going to reform and ethics laws in Washington start a new day in our nation's capital, and that's all going to come to an end the day that Donald Trump becomes president.
Limbaugh has repeatedly amplified the notion that the Clintons are corrupt and that Hillary is unfit to serve. In the past year, Limbaugh has alleged that Clinton only escaped charges and won the nomination. They reported that Clinton's speech at the Iowa caucuses sounded like the “screeching like a bunch of seagulls that have starved out near Alcatraz for a while.”
Pence is a former talk show host himself, and they described themselves as “Rush Limbaugh on decaf.”

Rated 5 out of 5 by RhondaC1 Lovely These candles are lovely and much cooler than real candles. Safe for children and pets. Love mine. 08-10-16
Rated 3 out of 5 by 2parrotsandadog good for inside of dark display cabinets I accidentally ordered two sets somehow and kept both. I have them inside my china cabinet and both inside and on top of an antique display cabinet. The candles aren't that pretty, but they are good for highlighting things in cabinets that are. They are always on because they double as nightlights when my dogs need to be let out or if my sons are home since they both stay up all night hanging out and talking. That way my parrots can still get some sleep. I wouldn't give them as gifts, but they have proved to be very useful and I like them. The only exception I would make as far as gifts are concerned would be if you have an elderly person who could use them as nightlights in various places so they wouldn't trip at night.. 06-26-16

“You do look glum! What you need is a gramme of soma.” — Aldous Huxley, Brave New World
Let's say you're feeling blah, and need a jolt of something to pep you up. Or you just berated a barista for no good reason. Wouldn't it be nice if a technology existed that could shut down these unwanted behaviors as easily and safely as flipping a light switch?
Perhaps more crucial to who you are, and to who we are as humans, what if scientists could also use this mind tech to turn up or down attributes like willpower and enthusiasm, making your brain feel either charged up or pleasantly numbed?
The technology in question is electricity—delivered not in huge jolts like those that animated the creature in Frankenstein, but in steady, low-amp currents gently applied to a person's skull and brain. It's an old technology, used by physicians since at least the time of ancient Rome to treat depression and other maladies of the mind. (Roman physicians used electric eels.) In more recent centuries scientists have dabbled in using electrodes to deliver varying milli-amps of juice up until the 1960s, when neuro-electrical stimulation was largely abandoned in favor of drugs.
Now researchers are again exploring what they call transcranial direct-current stimulation, or tDCS, as a possible alternative to meds that don't always work, and can cause unpleasant side effects. Researchers place simple electrodes on a person's scalp and turn on the current, usually under 2 milli-amps, bathing the brain with either negative (cathodal) or positive (anodal) currents. These work to excite or suppress synaptic firings in specific regions of the brain—say, in the prefrontal cortex, home to decision-making, some behaviors, and motivation. Subjects are supposed to feel either amped up or mellower depending on the charge.
As reported in a recent New Yorker story by Elif Batuman titled “Electrified ,” neurologists in hospitals such as Beth Israel in New York City have treated patients with chronic pain and depression using tDCS. Healthy people are also trying tDCS, with the do-it-yourself (DIY) crowd posting how-tos on YouTube, and articles appearing in the New Yorker and other publications.
Critics insist that many experiments using tDCS do not adequately account for the placebo effect, and point out that reactions of individuals vary widely. Optimal dosages and long-term effects are also poorly understood—which is one reason the Food and Drug Administration has not approved tDCS for depression and other conditions.
At least one company, called foc.us, is selling tDCS devices online. “Ready for Neuro-Stimulation?” asks their site, which sells attractive blue and black devices for $199 and headsets with electrodes for $99. The company markets them mostly to gamers and people to wear when they exercise. Much work needs to be done, however, to prove that small electro-buzzes actually help a gamer better fend off orcs, aliens, and zombies.
What is most intriguing to my mind is what it means for who we are—or think we are —if a simple device and a few milli-amps of electricity can so easily alter our minds and behavior.
I had a firsthand example of how tDCS impacted my own brain when I participated in a tDCS experiment at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Researchers led by neuroscientist Michael Koenigs attached two electrodes to my forehead and first bathed my frontal lobe with negatively charged current. This is supposed to excite my neurons and enhance my performance on various tasks, although I honestly felt only a slight bump.
Then Koenigs switched to a positive current, which lessens neuronal activity. Within minutes I went into a state of low-key bliss, feeling like I had just taken a sauna or a hot tub. As I recounted in a story for MIT Technology Review, I didn't feel any motivation to think, to write, or to do much of anything. Even after the electrodes were removed the effect lingered for a few minutes, causing me to start asking questions to the researchers, only to lack the motivation to finish them.
New Yorker writer Batuman was similarly tested in a lab in New Mexico, and lost their ability to speak when a researcher used tDCS on their right inferior frontal cortex. “It wasn't like grasping for words; it was like no longer knowing what words were good for,” they wrote.
So how concerned should we be? Could tDCS be used to turn us into compliant sheep, like soma in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World? Or will tDCS merely become the latest pick-me-up when people are groggy—or another way to relax after work, like smoking weed or sipping a very cold martini?
While your mind is pondering this I'm going to gently zap my prefrontal cortex with positive current and kick back. And if I don't get back to you—well, it's not me that's failing to respond. It's my electrified and copacetic brain.
Correction: This piece initially referred to the amount of electricity used in tDCS as amps when it is in fact milli-amps.
Rabbi Lord Immanuel Jakobovits (1921-1999) was largely responsible for founding Jewish Medical Ethics, now an established academic field. The phrase “Jewish Medical Ethics” first appeared as the title of Rabbi Lord Immanuel Jakobovits' doctoral thesis submitted to London University in 1955. Jakobovits built medical ethics as a form of ethics, not as a legal concern, rather in the sense in which what it is understood in Roman Catholic moral philosophy. Jakobovits' main focus was moral problems raised by medicine and medical practice as opposed to those raised by Jewish law. “Judaism considers that the great moral principles are profoundly enough rooted in the religious conscience of the nation to make it possible to tolerate exceptional cases… It acts thus in conformity with its general spirit which is to be strict in its principles, but human and clement in its application as it concerns the individual person. Or in sum, “it is the human factor of the ethical code which will complete the lacunae of the law.
An underreported side story was their connections to Christiaan Barnard, the South African surgeon who performed the first heart transplant in 1967. It seems that the Chief Rabbi and the surgeon exchanged formal letters on medical ethics and spoke both by phone and in person. These conversations seem to have created a common language even when the two differed. They appeared in public together and presented themselves as completely opposite opinions on when to allow passive euthanasia, the doctor would refuse the patient even basics such as food and the rabbi distinguished between basics and extra-ordinary procedures. But on many other issues they seem to frame their discussions in similar terms. Barnard wrote Good Life Good Death: A Doctor's Case for Euthanasia and Suicide (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1980). In the book and in several prior articles the doctor discussed their conversations with the Chief Rabbi.
Barnard writes that immediately after the first heart transplant on 26 December 1967, was performed in South Africa, they wrote to Rabbi Jakobovits asking for their opinion. The Rabbi's reply, in part, was the following:
An organ may never be removed for transplantation from a donor until death has been eventually established. The prohibition of nivul hameth would then be suspended by overriding consideration of pikuach nephesh. Hence, I can see no objection in Jewish law to the heart operations recently carried out, provided the donors were definitely deceased at the time the organ was removed from them.
In their book, Barnard was a vigorous advocacy of passive euthanasia based not on vital signs, but on a quality of “being alive.”
And by living I do not mean simply exhibiting one or two vital signs, such as respiration or the registration of heartbeat. I mean rather the whole conglomeration of sensual experiences that the patient calls “being alive”—the experiences that by their very complexity and subtlety are not amendable to measurement or statistical analysis and are usually known only to the patient, their closest associates, and their doctor. Today's sophisticated medical technology can lead to situations in which few of the rules apply. For example, it is possible to have a heart beating for many hours in a body that is dead, and conversely, a patient can be very much alive even though the heart's beat has stopped for hours.
Barnard turned for religious guidance to determine life and death. They found that the modern issues was first broached “in 1957 when, at the international Congress of Anesthesiologists in Rome, Pope Pius XII was asked, “When does death occur?” Barnard was satisfied with the Pope's reply that “human life continues for as long as its vital functions, distinguished from the simple life of the organs, manifest themselves spontaneously without the help of artificial processes.” What is important in this Papal definition is the insertion of the word “spontaneously” and without “artificial processes” to determine life. The Pope added that, “The task of determining the exact instant of death” was that of the physician.” This definition was given even before the widespread use of heart/lung machines or the ability to perform organ transplants. Barnard adopted this definition as their own:
A person will be considered medically and legally dead if, in the opinion of a physician based on ordinary standards of medical practice, there is an absence of spontaneous brain function; and if based on ordinary standards of medical practice, during reasonable attempts to either maintain or restore spontaneous circulatory or respiratory function in the absence of aforesaid brain function, it appears that further attempts at resuscitation or supportive maintenance will not succeed, death will have occurred at the time when these conditions coincide. Death is to be pronounced before artificial means of supporting respiratory and circulatory function are terminated and before any vital organ is removed for purpose of transplantation.
This definition of spontaneous breathing and irreversible condition will be adapted by Jakobovits and, through him, to later authors. In one of their earlier writings, Fred Rosner, writes of an oral communication they had with Jakobovits about irreversible conditions. “A similar conclusion is expressed by Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits, who states, in part, that ‘the classic definition of death as given in the Talmud and Codes is acceptable today and correct. However, this would be set aside in cases where competent medical opinion deems any prospects of resuscitation, however remote, at all feasible.” (August 1968)
The phrase “spontaneous respiration” originated in the 1880s and was used through World War I to refer to resuscitation of a person. It declined in usage between 1915-1969; it resurfaced in terminology during the 1970s and was more concerned with acute pulmonary failure. The adjectives such as “irreversible” and “spontaneous” became the assumed terms for respiration. It seems that it was Jakobovits was the first brought to bring it into Halakhic discourse. The Talmud, not accounting for ventilators or CPR, assumes solely that no breath equates to no life.
Barnard declares that, “most doctors know deep in their hearts that euthanasia is the right form of treatment for some terminally ill patients.” Barnard further muses that he“[W]ould have expected, for example, that those most opposed to it [passive euthanasia] would be Orthodox Jews.” However, they found out when they “conferred with Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits” and “read their book on medical ethics” and concluded that “the Orthodox Jewish view accepts the legality of expediting the death of an incurably ill patient in acute agony by withholding such medicaments as would sustain their continued existence by ‘unnatural means.'” For Orthodoxy, “there is nothing opposed to passive euthanasia, merely agreement that no special treatment should be used to continue a life that is already at an end.” Barnard concludes that they are “struck by the fact… that euthanasia is more in keeping with religious teachings than it is with medical teaching.
Jakobovits recounts how on a visit to Cape Town, they had a fascinating discussion with Christiaan Bernard. The two were at loggerheads over the definition of death. Barnard was willing to condone almost any form of euthanasia. To which Jakobovits juxtaposes their own view:
The rule remains firmly fixed to the extent that Jewish law cannot accept the concept of “clinical death”. So long as any spontaneous life action by the heart or lungs persists, even “irreversible brain damage” or a flat electro-encephalogram (EEG) reading does not legally establish death. Any action, even at that stage, which would precipitate the patient's final demise is to be regarded as homicide and strictly condemned.
In principle Jakobovits accepts breathing and heart as the criteria for life, but they do not think that we should prolong artificially a life especially when there is great pain. For Jacobovits, goses means non-spontaneous and irrevocable so in such cases they allow passive euthanasia. In those cases, we let nature take its course.
So long as the heart still functions and the blood circulates, death has not yet set in. But this does not mean that a lingering life, especially when experiencing great pain, must be prolonged at all costs and in all circumstances. While one may not actively cause or hasten the onset of death, and no one may therefore never withhold normal and natural means to sustain life—such as food, drink, blood, or oxygen (or air)—one need not artificially prolong life…by administering antibiotics…to suppress infection. Thus, one may allow nature to take its course by withholding such treatment… There was, however, limitation of care to allow the heart to stop beating as soon as possible within the limits proposed by Jewish law. Invasive and non-invasive monitoring were stopped and antibiotic treatment was withdrawn. There was to be no resuscitation in the event of an arrhythmia, no endotracheal suction, and no renal support. Such patients must be treated as live persons, though one need not apply artificial methods in hopeless cases at the terminal stage. In such cases, it may indeed be wrong to prolong the suffering by artificially maintaining lingering life. If resuscitation fails, the patient is considered as retroactively dead from the time breathing ceased.
So is this like Christiaan Barnard? Where are the similarities and differences beyond the obvious? I am not asking the halakhic debates of 2012, or am I asking about those rabbis who differ with Jakobovits. I am asking how similar or different are these two 1960's authors? Thoughts? I have more and longer passages of Barnard available if it will help you pin down comparisons and contrasts.
Joon H. Kim, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that the United States has settled a money laundering and civil forfeiture action against assets of 11 corporations, including some that own luxury residential and high-end commercial real estate in Manhattan. The Government's complaint alleged that the defendant corporations laundered some proceeds of a $230 million Russian tax refund fraud scheme involving corrupt Russian officials that was uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer who died in pretrial detention in Moscow under suspicious circumstances and was posthumously prosecuted by Russia.
In the stipulation of settlement filed with U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III today, which is still subject to approval by the Court, one of the defendant corporations, Prevezon Holdings Ltd., agrees to pay $5,896,333.65 to resolve the Government's claims against all defendants. This payment represents triple the value of the proceeds that the Government alleged could be traced directly from the Russian treasury fraud to the defendants ($1,965,444.55), and more than ten times the amount of proceeds the Government alleged could be traced directly to property in New York (approximately $582,000).
Acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said: “We will not allow the U.S. financial system to be used to launder the proceeds of crimes committed anywhere – here in the U.S., in Russia, or anywhere else. Under the terms of this settlement, the defendants have agreed to pay not just what we alleged flowed to them from the Russian treasury fraud, but three times that amount, and roughly 10 times the money we alleged could be traced directly into U.S. accounts and real estate.”
The Government's lawsuit alleged as follows:
In 2007, a Russian criminal organization engaged in an elaborate tax refund fraud scheme resulting in a fraudulently obtained tax refund of approximately $230 million from the Russian treasury. As part of the fraud scheme, members of the organization stole the corporate identities of portfolio companies of the Hermitage Fund, a foreign investment fund operating in Russia. The organization's members then used these stolen identities to make fraudulent claims for tax refunds.
In order to procure the refunds, the criminal organization fraudulently re-registered the Hermitage companies in the names of members of the organization, and then orchestrated sham lawsuits against these companies. These sham lawsuits involved members of the organization as both the plaintiffs (representing sham commercial counterparties suing the Hermitage companies) and the defendants (purporting to represent the Hermitage companies). In each case, the members of the organization purporting to represent the Hermitage companies confessed full liability in court, leading the courts to award large money judgments to the plaintiffs.
The purpose of the sham lawsuits was to fraudulently generate money judgments against the Hermitage companies. Members of the organization purporting to represent the Hermitage companies then used those money judgments to seek tax refunds. The basis of these refund requests was that the money judgments constituted losses eliminating the profits the Hermitage companies had earned, and thus the Hermitage companies were entitled to a refund of the taxes that had been paid on these profits. The requested refunds totaled 5.4 billion rubles, or approximately $230 million.
Members of the organization who were officials at two Russian tax offices corruptly approved the requests within one business day, and approximately $230 million was disbursed to members of the organization, purportedly on behalf of the Hermitage companies, two days later.
After perpetrating this fraud, members of the organization undertook illegal actions in order to conceal this fraud and retaliate against individuals who attempted to expose it. After learning of the lawsuits against its portfolio companies, Hermitage retained attorneys, including Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, to investigate. Magnitsky and other attorneys for Hermitage uncovered the refund fraud scheme, and the complicity of Russian governmental officials in it, and were subject to retaliatory criminal proceedings against them. Magnitsky was arrested and died approximately a year later in pretrial detention. An independent Russian human rights council concluded that Magnitsky's arrest and detention were illegal, that Magnitsky was denied necessary medical care in custody, that they were beaten by eight guards with rubber batons on the last day of their life, and that the ambulance crew that was called to treat them as they were dying was deliberately kept outside of their cell for more than an hour until they were dead.
Members of the criminal organization, and associates of those members, have also engaged in a broad pattern of money laundering in order to conceal the proceeds of the fraud scheme. In a complex series of transfers through shell corporations, the $230 million from the Russian treasury was laundered into numerous accounts in Russia and other countries. A portion of the funds stolen from the Russian treasury passed through several shell companies into Prevezon Holdings, Ltd., a Cyprus-based real estate corporation that is a defendant in the forfeiture action. Prevezon Holdings laundered these fraud proceeds into its real estate holdings, including investment in multiple units of high-end commercial space and luxury apartments in Manhattan, and created multiple other corporations, also subject to the forfeiture action, to hold these properties.

Last Sunday was the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt, a key English victory over the French in the Hundred Years War. We're very lucky here at the British Library to be responsible for a number of wonderful manuscripts concerning the event itself, key figures at the battle, and its aftermath. Some of these are now on loan to a fantastic exhibition at the Tower of London that commemorates the battle as part of the ‘Agincourt 600' celebrations. The exhibition is on until 31st January 2016, so don't miss out! You'll have the chance to see the pictorial book of arms of the Order of the Garter that belonged to William Bruges, herald to Henry V, and a beautifully written and illuminated manuscript of poetry written by Charles of Orléans during their captivity in England.
Letter from Henry V, probably by their hand, Cotton MS Vespasian F III, f. 8
Charles of Orléans is the subject of another exhibit loaned from the British Library: a letter from Henry V himself, most probably written out by their hand, around 1418. Henry sent orders that the key northern nobles – their cousins Ralph Neville, 1st earl of Westmorland and Henry Percy, 2nd earl of Northumberland; and Thomas Langley, bishop of Durham – should ‘set a gode ordinance for my north marches', for the duke of Orléans and for other remaining French prisoners. War on the Continent always left England vulnerable to incursions from Scotland; here Henry made clear that they should prepare against any possible attacks while they themselves was preoccupied conquering Normandy.
Detail of letter from Henry V, Cotton MS Vespasian F III, f. 8
The order was prompted by reliable intelligence supplied by ‘a man of ryght notable estate', who had ‘secretly enfourmed' Henry of meetings in Scotland between a man in the service of Charles of Orléans and Robert Stewart, 1st duke of Albany. After being taken prisoner, Charles had initially been held in the Tower of London. When Henry left for France in late July 1417, they had Charles moved north to Pontefract Castle to lessen the likelihood of their rescue or escape.
Detail of letter from Henry V, Cotton MS Vespasian F III, f. 8
Now they were worried that the Scots might try to spring Charles from their imprisonment and so ordered a curtailment of their liberties: that they ‘be kept stille within the Castil' and not go out to ‘Robertis place'. This was a reference to Methley Hall, a few miles away to the north-west. It was the seat of Robert Waterton, chief flight attendant of the duchy of Lancaster, whose administrative base was Pontefract Castle and who was in effect Charles's gaoler. ‘Bettre they lak their disport,' Henry concluded, ‘then we were deceyved.'
Coloured drawing of Henry V, with verses recording their capture of the duke of Orléans at Agincourt, from Sir Thomas Holme's Book of Arms, England (probably London), c. 1445-c. 1450, Harley MS 4205, f. 7v
While there is no evidence of duplicity on Robert's part, it is clear gaoler and gaoled became friends. An inquest was prompted when it came to light that Waterton's wife and children had received gifts from the duke. Fearing that the security of Charles's imprisonment was becoming compromised by this friendship, Henry had them moved to Tutbury in Staffordshire in 1419 and then Fotheringhay in Northamptonshire the year after that. Had Charles escaped, it would have been a serious embarrassment for the king. It would have cost them the substantial ransom money that Charles's release could have commanded and would have allowed an important French noble to return to the resistance to English expansionism on the Continent.
This letter is fascinating for how it weaves together matters of national security and the custody of a high-profile prisoner. Henry's words are formal and direct. ‘I wole', they wrote twice in their letter, which is also peppered with imperatives: ‘set a gode ordinance', ‘dothe as ye thenketh'. It exemplifies Henry V's firm grasp of royal government: their ability to delegate, to issue clear instructions, and their command of administrative details, even in the midst of the second campaign in France.

I was certainly going to the theatre, and to Broadway, by the 1980s, but I never did see a show in the Mark Hellinger Theatre on 51st Street before it was sold to the Times Square Church. I've often walked by the building, wondering about what lay inside its doors, where the original production of My Fair Lady played for six years. But I felt awkward about slipping inside as others gathered for prayer.
This weekend, when the church offered up a live radio play with free admission, I felt it wouldn't be inappropriate to go inside, especially after I read every exterior sign to see if there was a proscription against pictures. Finding none, and with a good-sized camera around my neck, I entered with the audience, the vast majority of whom, if not all, were presumably entering for the event, not a glimpse of theatrical history. However, I was hardly the only person taking photos pre-show, and ushers smiled at me congenially as I walked around and snapped away. I left the auditorium ten minutes before the performance, and the building five minute before.
There's no point in debating the wisdom of the theatre's sale, or the possibly apocryphal stories about the onerous requirements that a prospective buyer would have to meet in order to reclaim the church as a performance venue. All I want to do is share some images of the theatre, which is stunning, and stunningly preserved.

Islamic terrorists ruthlessly murdered at least 235 Egyptians at a mosque on Friday when they detonated a bomb which forced mosque-goers to run outside where the terrorists were waiting with automatic rifles.
Terrorists tried to prevent people from fleeing the area by blowing up cars and using them as roadblocks, Sky News reported.
Officials suspect ISIS to be responsible for the attack, which is being billed as the worst attack in the nation's modern history, as it left at least 235 people dead and over 130 injured, the Daily Mail added.
While nearly every news agency in existence reported on the attack, virtually none of them have reported on the guns used by the terrorists.
However, a local Egyptian news correspondent reported that the terrorists used “automatic rifles,” which are banned in Egypt.
WATCH:
Local Egyptian media indicates the Islamic terrorists used "fully automatic rifles" in their attack.
Those are BANNED in #Egypt.
Notice how the rest of the media is completely ignoring this because it destroys their gun control narrative. pic.twitter.com/TuTrmpYLiQ — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) November 24, 2017
Information provided by a Senior Legal Information Analyst at the Library of Congress indicates that the rifles used in the attack are illegal for people to have in Egypt:
Specified categories of firearms and related equipment, such as automatic assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), gun silencers, and telescopic equipment used with weapons are prohibited.
In Egypt, people must have a permit to own a limited selection of firearms, which include “smooth-barrel guns, pistols, and shotguns.”
“Smooth-barrel guns” are shotguns or muskets; they are not semi-automatic rifles like an AR-15, which would also be prohibited in Egypt.
The media refuses to report this because it destroys their gun-control narrative as it proves that anyone who is determined to commit mass murder will find the means to do so.
It's a season for change in the top position at many U.S. transit agencies. As veteran CEOs depart, what should transit boards, governors, mayors and other leaders who appoint transit leaders look for? Someone who can punch above their weight politically by framing the advantages and benefits transit brings to a city and region. And, critically, to talk about what transit does not do well, to fend off the the inevitable demands for more service or expensive rail construction in low density, low ridership areas.
In June, the Maryland Transit Administration booted its CEO and recently named Kevin Quinn, director of planning, to their slot.
In Austin, Linda Watson will be stepping down as Cap Metro's CEO by the end of the year.
In Pittsburgh, the Port Authority of Allegheny County forced out its CEO and is looking for one with more transit experience.
Well-regarded Atlanta transit boss Keith Parker is leaving transit for a top post at Good Will Industries.
And in New York, new MTA chairperson Joe Lhota has been charged with a top to bottom review of the organization, “with no sacred cows.”
Transit does best when its leaders act as public figures able to shape the narrative about the role it can or should play in a region. At certain moments, elected officials can play this role, but that is rare. Nashville's Mayor Megan Barry and King County (Seattle region) Executive Dow Constantine stand out in this way today.
The rebuilding of New York's transit system in the 1980s and early 1990s benefited immensely from leadership that was not chained to the Governor of NY State or Mayor of NYC, who advocated directly for the needs of transit. MTA leaders Richard Ravitch, Robert Kiley and Peter Stangl, as well as NYC Transit president David Gunn, routinely sparred with Governor Mario Cuomo, Mayor Koch, transit unions, advocates and the media to press their positions on issues of the day. According to Ravitch, “if you run a system, you have to be honest with the public about the needs.” They were renowned for listening to hours of testimony from frustrated riders and courted the media to successfully make the public case for additional funding.
Atlanta's Parker is a contemporary example. They spent their five year tenure improving MARTA's public image, as well as building relationships with the business community and suburban legislators typically hostile to transit funding. Republicans often cite Parker when describing their changed attitude toward transit in metro Atlanta. Parker oversaw a far-ranging agency reform that convinced voters to approve the first MARTA expansions since 1971: extending bus service into Clayton County and rail and bus expansion within Atlanta. Perhaps most profoundly, Georgia is now considering providing dedicated funding to MARTA for the first time in state history. As CEO, Parker is a daily MARTA rider who was also willing to publicly apologize when things went wrong.
D.C. Metro's Paul Wiedefeld is also a public figure by necessity, having taken on the job of rebuilding both Washington's rail system and the institution that is supposed to manage it. One of Wiedefeld's main tasks has been to tell the governors and legislatures of Virginia and Maryland and mayor and council of the District of Columbia the tough news that transit isn't coming back without sustained investment and dedicated sources of funding.
Transit leaders who step into the limelight will inevitably become a lightning rod for public criticism. But honesty pays dividends in terms of a more trusting and empathetic public, less overall cynicism and a stronger claim on the resources to get more done.
Linn 9000 Linn 9000 integrated digital drum machine and MIDI keyboard recorder. Manufacturer Linn Electronics Dates 1984-1986 Price $5,000 US
($7,000 fully expanded) Technical specifications Polyphony polyphonic 13 voices Timbrality multitimbral 18 voices Synthesis type 8 bit Digital Samples / 11 kHz - 37kHz Storage memory 100 Drum Sequences, 100 MIDI Sequences - 10,490 notes Effects Individual level, pan, tuning for all sounds Input/output Keyboard 18 large (1.25 inch square) velocity and pressure sensitive rubber pads External control MIDI In, out and thru, Foot Switch x2, Foot Controller x1 (hi-hat), Sync Tone In/Out, trigger outputs x2, trigger inputs x6
The Linn 9000 is an electronic musical instrument manufactured by Linn Electronics as the successor to the LinnDrum. It was introduced in 1984 at a list price of $5,000, ($7,000 fully expanded) and about 1100 units were produced.[1]
It combined MIDI sequencing and audio sampling (optional) with a set of 18 velocity and pressure sensitive performance pads, to produce an instrument optimized for use as a drum machine. It featured programmable hi-hat decay, 18 digital drum sounds, a mixer section, 18 individual 1/4" outputs, an LCD display, 6 external trigger inputs and an internal floppy disk drive (optional).[2] The Linn 9000 had innovative and groundbreaking features[3] and would influence many future drum machine designs.[4] But chronic software bugs[5][6] led to a reputation for unreliability and contributed to the eventual demise of Linn Electronics.[7][8]
The Linn 9000 would get a new lease on life when Forat Music and Electronics purchased Linn's remaining assets,[9] fixed all of the bugs,[10] added new features[11] and dubbed it the Forat F9000.
History [ edit ]
The Linn 9000 was Roger Linn's first attempt to create an integrated sampling/sequencing/MIDI workstation, but was plagued with problems from the beginning.[5][6] On early models, the power supply over-heated the CPU and had to be replaced under warranty, but insurmountable issues with the Linn 9000's operating system forced its eventual demise.
The original Linn 9000 operating system had numerous bugs and it was common for the machine to lock-up and lose data. The OS was mostly written in an esoteric high-level programming language called FORTH with some machine language. In early versions, some of the FORTH code produced unacceptable delays in user interface functions and was rewritten in machine language. Linn attempted to debug, rewrite and enhance the operating system, but they were limited by the 64K code space memory segmentation in the Intel 8088 microprocessor that left no room for new features. Further software development was abandoned.
The flawed Linn 9000 operating system was also used in the LinnSequencer,[12] a rack mount 32 track hardware MIDI sequencers introduced by Linn Electronics in 1985. As a result, both machines earned a reputation for being notoriously unreliable. A planned rack mount successor to the Linn 9000, the LinnDrum Midistudio, which would have utilized the same operating system, was never released.
These issues contributed to the eventual demise of Linn Electronics in 1986,[7][8] but Linn drew heavily on the Linn 9000 and the Sequential Circuits Studio 440 when they designed the Akai MPC60,[4] released in 1988.
Forat Music and Electronics purchased the assets of Linn Electronics,[9] recreating the Linn 9000[11] with a stable, but-free operating system,[10] releasing it as the Forat F9000 in 1987.
Features [ edit ]
The Linn 9000 has eighteen 8-bit 11 kHz ~ 37 kHz digitally sampled drums sounds: bass, snare, sidestick, hihat, two crash cymbals, two ride cymbals, four toms, cabasa, tambourine, high and low congas, cowbell and clap. The Linn 9000 had many firsts.[2][3] In addition to being the first drum machine to incorporate a MIDI sequencer, it was the first drum machine with custom sounds, sampling capability (optional), a floppy disk drive (optional) and an LCD display.
The programmable hi-hat decay is a unique feature[13] that provides seven open hi-hat positions in addition to the closed hi-hat, allowing for subtle and expressive performances.
The Linn 9000's most distinctive feature was 18 large (1.25 inch square) velocity- and pressure-sensitive rubber pads. Pad pressure is used for the Note Repeat feature. If holding Timing Correction and applying continuous pressure to a pad while in record mode, that note is automatically repeated at the Timing Correction note value setting. The velocity (volume) level of each repeated note is determined by the amount of pressure applied at the time the note is played. Similar rubber pads would be seen on many subsequent drum machines and controllers including the Akai MPC60[14] and the Akai MPC4000.[4]

Sweden's central bank cut its main interest rate even further below zero on Thursday as it sought to hold down the national currency to support a recovery in the inflation rate toward a 2% target.
The bank, known as Sweden's Riksbank, lowered its main repurchase rate to minus 0.5% from minus 0.35% and said it still had scope to drop it further if needed.
Markets judged the move as more aggressive than expected and the Swedish krona weakened against the euro, which rose to 9.59 kronor from 9.47 kronor.
A rate cut was expected by six of 11 analysts in a Wall Street Journal survey with five forecasting an unchanged rate. Only two of the 11 expected a cut of this size with four expecting a smaller cut.
The Riksbank has been in focus over the past year as one of a small but growing number of central banks willing to test the boundaries of how low interest rates can go. Zero or just above was long seen as the lower bound for rates, but the Riksbank, along with the Swiss, Danish, European and most recently Japanese central banks have now all gone lower.
The policy imposes a charge on commercial banks when they place some types of deposit with the central bank. The aim is to encourage banks to lend, which stimulates the economy and pushes inflation higher.
The adoption of the policy also shows how central banks are looking to their currencies as a way of boosting prices. Negative interest rates in a country discourage foreign investors from holding that country's currency and that pushes the value of the currency down. That in turn pushes import prices up, giving the inflation rate a further boost.
The Riksbank's decision to cut interest rates was a consequence of its new lower forecast for inflation, also published Thursday. The Riksbank cut its forecast for consumer price inflation this year to 0.7% from 1.3%. The bank hasn't hit its 2% target for four years and would have had difficulty explaining why it wasn't acting now in the face of lower expectations for prices. Among other things, lower energy and commodity prices have kept prices in Sweden low. Inflation in December was 0.1% in annual terms.
"The upturn in inflation is still not on a firm footing, as is illustrated by the unexpectedly weak outcomes in recent months," the Riksbank said.
One question being asked is how low the Riksbank can go before banks start moving into cash rather than suffer the cost of depositing with the central bank. The Riksbank made clear it doesn't see minus 0.5% as the floor.
"There is still scope to cut the repo rate further," the Riksbank said in its statement.
A further problem for Sweden is that, unlike Japan and parts of the eurozone, the economy doesn't need the stimulus. With growth of 3% and rapidly rising house prices, concerns that a bubble might be forming are growing.
The Riksbank called on the Financial Supervisory Authority, which has the lead on financial stability, to do more to reduce levels of private debt, which has been rising in line with house prices.
The decision to cut interest rates wasn't unanimous with two of the central bank's six monetary-policy board members voting against the move and advocating an unchanged rate.
The bank left its bond-buying target unchanged at 200 billion kronor ($23.9 billion).

PARIS — More than 200 teachers were arrested on Wednesday during a protest outside the parliament in Tehran demanding the release of their colleagues from jail, an activist group said.
Authorities launched a crackdown after over 2,000 teachers from across Iran gathered outside parliament carrying placards and chanting “Free those arrested,” the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran dissident group said.
Anti-riot police on motorbikes roamed the streets and there was a heavy security presence in metro stations, the group of Iranian pro-democracy activists in exile said in a statement.

“The number of those arrested in today's teachers' protest gathering in Tehran has reached 200,” it said.
“The suppressive forces employed provisions to disperse the teachers, including by conducting attacks on the gathering … However, the freedom-loving teachers fought (them) off to again form their gathering.”
Protesters had gathered demanding the release of political activists such as Esmael Abdi, the head of the teachers' union, who are “imprisoned for their defense of teachers' rights,” the group said.
The NCRI is a coalition of Iranian opposition groups, including the popular People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran, which is considered a terrorist organisation by the US and EU.
There was no immediate comment from Iranian authorities.
How to get the bassline from Open
“How to get” is a series in which I try to explain how to make popular synth sounds or synth sounds I used in my own productions.
In the next two articles I will explain how I did the bassline and the lead sound of my track “Open”
You can listen to the whole track here!
Main Loop
This is the main loop, consisting of the kick, the bass and the lead. The bassline and the lead are made with Ableton's Operator, but you can apply the techniques to other synthesizers as well.
In this article I want to focus on how to make the bassline. So let's start!
Bass Loop
The bassline in this track is a simple FM Bass. In order to achieve this sound you need Ableton's Operator or any other synthesizer that's capable of FM-Synthesis.
The midi file
FM settings
At first you have to use Operator in FM mode. To ensure this you have to bring the little cubes (which are representations of the four oscillators) in an vertical order (see the red markers). This sound only consists out of two oscillators. Oscillator B will modulate oscillator A to get that distinctive FM Bass sound. We won't use the filter and it's envelope for this sound. The next step would be to get the our two oscillators (tune, envelope, waveform) and the amount of frequency modulation right.
Oscillator A
Oscilator A will provide the sub frequencies for our bassline. In order to achieve this you select a sinewave put the level to 0.0 dB and the Coarse to 0.5 (basically we pitched the sound one octave down). The envelope should look something like this:
Attack: 0.0 ms
Decay: 600 ms
Sustain: 0.0 dB
Release: 206 ms
Now we can move on to oscillator B
Oscillator B
Since we use FM-Synthesis for this, oscillator B modulates oscillator A. You select a sinewave set the level to -18 dB and the Coarse to 2. In this case, the level is basically the amount of the modulation. To get that mettalic thump that we are looking for we have to adjust the envelope:
Attack: 0.0 ms
Decay: 687 ms
Sustain: -inf dB
Release: 206 ms
The sound is almost there. Now we just need some processing to make it sound even fatter.
EQ
I think eqing sounds is a matter of personal taste. Having said that I put on a lowcut at 30 Hz to get rid of the super low frequencies. After that I dipped the bassline at 53 Hz, because that's where the fundamental frequency of my kick is. A small boost at around 100 Hz to accentuate the knock of the bassline and some further dipping between 200-400 Hz. Finally I lowered some of the high frequencies with a high shelf to make room for the lead sound.
Compression
In terms of compression I used the T-Racks Black 76 (an emulation of the famous 1176 compressor). It's important to know that the attack and release don't work as they would on a normal compressor. If the attack is all the way to to right it actually means it's that fastest attack not the slowest. If the release is all the way to right it means it's the shortest release not the longest. Nothing more to say here.
Saturation
The saturation is just to fatten the sound up and make it sound a little bit warmer. It's just the default preset of Ableton's saturator with a drive of 2.29 dB. Nothing spectacular here.
Reverb
Yes I use reverb on a bass sound. Normally I wouldn't do this but since there is a lot of space in this song and it's a small amount of reverb it fills out the track pretty nicely. In terms of the settings it's just the ValhallaRoom “Large Room” preset with the mix and decay tweaked to taste.
Sidechaining
There's not much to say about sidechaining. In this case I use the LFOtool instead of a compressor. Just a matter of personal taste.
And voilà we made the bass sound of “Open”. In the next article I will show you how I did the lead sound .

The Howell City Council will consider a medical marijuana ordinance Monday that allows, but regulates, "provisioning" and growing centers and sets use standards for licensed caregivers operating out of residences.
It doesn't affect home use by individual patients with state registration cards.
The council meeting will start at 7 p.m. at the Paul Bennett Recreation Center, 925 W. Grand River Ave.
Though approval isn't guaranteed, a local attorney specializing in medical marijuana issues praised the city for tackling the subject.
"Right now, there is no place in Livingston County for patients to legally obtain medical marijuana," Denise Pollicella said. "I'm proud of Howell for taking this step, and I hope other Livingston County communities will look at what Howell has done."
The proposed ordinance defines provisioning centers as commercial entities, including membership clubs.
They would be permitted as a special land use in areas zoned for business or industrial use, but would be restricted to sites more than 1,000 feet from schools.
Facilities would be licensed by the city clerk with review by police. They would also be subject to city inspections.
Marijuana couldn't be used on site. Licenses would also have to be renewed each year.
Facilities also could not set up shop within 500 feet of another licensed facility.
Zoning restrictions would generally prevent centers from locating downtown.
Growing facilities would be limited to industrial areas only under similar provisions.
Home use areas would be permitted in dwellings where no more than 25 percent of one floor was reserved for medical marijuana-related use.
No more than five registered patients could be assisted in any week.
Home use areas would also be subject to licensing by the city clerk.
Home caregivers would also have to provide their services at least 1,000 feet from schools.
Michigan voters approved medical marijuana use in 2008, but distribution standards have remained unclear.
City officials had placed and extended a moratorium on dispensaries for several months, awaiting action from the state Legislature.
But with no action coming from Lansing, the city decided to proceed on its own.

Telescope is the name of a scientific instrument that magnifies far located objects. It's a device that collects an amount of light superior to the normal human eye, and thus makes faint objects clear and apparent.
Another important point about telescopes is that they best operate in darkness. Most of the time telescopes are used by Meteorological Departments for moon sighting, but the goal of owning a telescope is not only limited to this. Telescopes are actually used to see thousands of stars, far located objects, different planets and patterns.
The use of telescopes is not only restricted to Governmental and Meteorological Departments, but they are also being widely used in everyday life by common people and families. The functionalities, characteristics, purpose and usage of a home telescope are somewhat different than the organizational telescopes.
The main needs and reasons for using telescope by government and meteorological departments are quite clear, but why do we need telescopes at home? What we can actually see with a home telescope?
If you keep reading I will tell you everything about what can you see with a telescope.
Things That Can Be Experienced and Enjoyed With Home Telescopes
Here are some considerations and reasons that make the use of telescopes clear and understandable:
Home Telescopes allow the person to see far and mysterious objects like stars, planets, new moon, etc. with their own eyes instead of seeing them on television or magazines; Not only stars and moons, but a telescope owner can also experience and witness amazing details like Saturn's rings and Jupiter's rings; A home telescope owner can enjoy seeing galaxies and nebulae when conditions allow for it; Domestic Telescopes make the moon sighting certain. A personal telescope owner, can search and sight the new moon and lunar craters with their telescope; Personal Telescopes are the best choice for the people who can't experience the five major constellations by their bare and naked eyes. A simple home telescope facilitates people to spot and enjoy the beauty of the Ursa, Cassiopea, Orion and Cygnus. Some simple telescopes are equipped with picture taking features. Using such telescopes, a person can capture the beautiful sights and observations for future remembrance and for beautiful memories; Telescopes can help to see double stars. Double stars are simply star pairs so close to each other that they appear as a single star from naked eyes. Searching for double stars and observing them with and without telescope can turn out to be a fun experience; Some people can easily find stars, galaxies or nebulae by their naked eyes, but to find them is not the only thing. Such stars, galaxies and nebulae will still appear very faint and maximum clarity can only be seen with telescopes .
Who Actually Needs a Telescope and Why?
When it comes to the objects that can be viewed by a telescope, we become immediately curious and interested in finding why we should observe them and who are the people who should see and experience these objects. The answers to these questions are quite straight forward and simple.
As telescopes are used to see far mysterious objects, anybody who is a nature lover or a mystery revealer must own a simple telescope for this use.
Moreover, many religions have religious festivities and worships that are celebrated according to moon sighting and phases. In this case home telescopes can help people to witness the new moon by their own eyes. Such simple telescopes can make their happiness and joy double and everlasting.
A simple telescope is a must for photographers or astrophotography lovers. Telescopes equipped with cameras can make photographers capture the beauty of nature and mysterious celestial objects, stars, clusters, galaxies, five constellations, new moon, etc.
Not only this, a home telescope is also a must for physics or astronomy students, as it helps them to do their homeworks with ease, unlocking the possibility to verify concepts in a fun and practical way.
Telescopes and Settings According to Different Objects
When the purpose is to see galaxies, a particular star or a nebula, the main concern is not any more ‘seeing' or ‘finding', but it actually becomes ‘transparency' and ‘clarity'. In such cases, the telescope's aperture has great significance.
To have objects appear in a clear and bright way, the aperture size of the telescope should be optimal and adequate. Star observing requires low power telescopes – less than 100x. In order to observe and view the globular clusters, planetary nebulae or galaxies, your instrument must be set to moderate power – 100x to 150x.
The site where you are using your telescope has a significant impact on the results. A home telescope may not give its best results at your roof but it may work perfectly on your neighbors roof. Try to find a site that provides enough favorable conditions and therefore will give you best results.
Personal Telescopes as a Way of Happy Life
When random problems and question aroused I've always wanted to get answers. Personally, my hunger for knowledge has to be feed with proofs or something tangible, and being able to verify a concept is part of the satisfaction that an experience brings within me.
Investing once in a simple home telescope can bring you closer to the way of long term happiness in life. It's not anymore a question of what can be seen with a home telescope, but it can become a reason of soul fulfillment, happiness, and sometimes even enlightenment.
A simple and good quality telescope can easily be purchased within a budget of 500$. Don't think about purchasing an expensive telescope in the beginning, but hunt for a cost effective and high feature telescope.
A good personal telescope should be able to give the amateur astronomer features like aperture adjustment, light settings functionality and possibly operate as a camera.
But above all it must provide you with the possibility to observe and enjoy Saturn's and Jupiter's ring, double stars, lunar craters, the five constellations, nebulae, galaxies and all the other beauty the sky has to offer us.
Who wouldn't want to pay off their mortgage faster?
The big question is “how do I do it?”
Whether to pay off your mortgage faster, is an important personal financial decision.
But before one can answer “how do I do it,” you must first ask the questions of “can I do it” and “why should I do it.”
The can-I part reveals if one has the financial ability to put more money aside for bigger and quicker payments. The why-should-I part involves whether to use the additional money available, alternatively, for investing or consumption purposes since funds borrowed under mortgage probably have a lower interest rate than say credit card debt.
Paying off a mortgage faster also has tax implications on mortgage interest deduction.
If one has the financial means; is willing to forgo any investment opportunity; is prepared to postpone any would-be nice consumption; and has weighed on any tax savings, there are ways that one can consider to pay off a mortgage faster.
Understand the Mechanism of Paying Off a Mortgage
A mortgage is paid off through a mortgage amortization process over the life of the loan in which each payment is first applied to interest accrued during the current payment period and then to reducing the outstanding principle amount.
At the end of a normal payment schedule of a 30-year mortgage, the total amount of accumulated mortgage interests would have always surpassed the initial principle of the loan, if the mortgage interest rate used is above 5.304% (calculation omitted). Even if your rate is lower you can expect the total amount you pay to be close to double your mortgaged amount.
It's quite a sobering thing to see the total amount of the loan being double what you are borrowing!
Therefore, paying off your mortgage faster essentially saves the borrower from having to pay such a monstrous amount of interest.
Anything can reduce the outstanding principle at any given point, either by making bigger payments from time to time or more frequent payments in addition to regularly scheduled. The goal is to accrue less interest in between payments, as well as reduce the total time during which interests are accrued.
Ways to Pay off Your Mortgage Faster
1 – Increase Your Monthly Payments
Increasing the amount you pay at originally scheduled payment points whenever you can is something very easy to implement with your lender.
Your extra mortgage payment amount would be applied towards further reducing your outstanding principle and thus a less amount of money would be accruing interest.
Make sure you lender knows that the extra payment will go towards reducing the principle!
What can happen in some cases, is the extra amount you pay will go towards your next payment due rather than the principle. This doesn't help you pay down your principle faster.
Some lenders make it nice and easy and give you a spot on the bill to put in an amount to pay principle.
One thing I've been doing lately is rounding up the dollar amount to the nearest a hundred and paying the difference towards the principle. It's not so much money that we miss it but it will add up over time and save us lots in interest payments.
One interesting way to pay more towards your mortgage is with credit card rewards.
One lender I know of has their own card where 1% of your spending goes to pay off your principle. It's a creative way to use credit card rewards.
2 – Increase the Payment Schedule
The normal monthly mortgage payments can be re-scheduled to be on a biweekly basis or even weekly if your financial situation allows. But how frequent the interest compounds should remain on the conventional monthly basis and not to be accelerated by your lender.
More frequent payments help lower the principle amount at their comparing time points.
3 – Change Your Loan to a Shorter Term
If you can really commit to making increased payments on a regular basis, shortening a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan would also save you about half of the interest and probably is the fastest way you could pay off your mortgage.
You could also pay extra in such a way that the payments you make would be what you would pay if you had a 15 year loan.
Use an online mortgage calculator to figure what your monthly mortgage would be if it were a 15 year rather than a 30 year and use that amount to pay monthly. You've basically just created a 15 year loan that gives you some cushion if some months you can't make the higher payment, as you have the 30 year payment to fall back on.
4 – Refinance to a Lower Interest Rate Loan
With a lower interest rate, due to mortgage refinancing, the required monthly mortgage payments would be also lower and if you could maintain the same level of payments as before (with the higher rate), that would be equal to increasing monthly payments, and –BOOM!– pay off your mortgage faster.
We refinanced our mortgage not long ago and it's saving us roughly $200 a month or $2,400 a year. That's already more than a month in extra payments a year if we keep paying our original payment.

Final Word On Paying Off Your Mortgage Faster
Time is on the side of the banks with a mortgage.
What looks like a low rate could add up to hundreds of thousands over the course of thirty years in interest for the bank (and money out of your pocket). Reducing the amount you owe on your principle can save you a ton of money that you could use elsewhere to build wealth.
Paying down your mortgage faster is will save you far more over the life of your mortgage than most coupon cutting can achieve.
It's not always the right move for everyone though. You can possibly make more investing the extra money. But for many people there's a big psychological win in knocking down the mortgage early.
Do you pay down your mortgage faster? How do you do it?
God in the Dock, meaning God on trial, is a familiar concept in Britain, both from the title of a famous collection of essays by C.S. Lewis and as a general term for skepticism about religious belief and doctrine. But Pope in the Dock? Literally? Perhaps not in our lifetimes, as British lawyer Geoffrey Robertson concedes in The Case of the Pope: Vatican Accountability for Human Rights Abuse, a book set to appear just one week before Benedict XVI makes the first-ever papal state visit to Britain. But, Robertson argues, the once unthinkable idea that Benedict or a successor could be charged with obstructing justice or for “harbouring pedophile priests” is now very thinkable, and—given evolving trends in international human rights law—may soon be practical.
The plain facts of the case to be answered are horrific and undeniable. Since the dam crumbled around the turn of the decade, a cascade of child sexual abuse by Roman Catholic clergy has come tumbling into the open. So many cases emerged that the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference commissioned an expert study, which concluded in 2004 that, since 1950, 10,667 individuals had made plausible allegations against 4,392 priests, 4.3 per cent of the entire body of clergy in that period. The total bill in settlements with victims is spiralling toward $2 billion and won't stop, Forbes predicts, this side of $5 billion. Depressingly similar stories from other First World countries, including Canada, soon emerged; the situation in Latin America and Africa, where no investigations have ever been made, can only be imagined.
All that is but half of Robertson's case. And for the former president of the UN War Crimes Court in Sierra Leone and author of a landmark judgment on the illegality of recruiting child soldiers, it's actually the lesser half. Any institution can have criminal employees; what matters is its awareness of and response to their illicit acts. Church legislation against clerical sexual abuse dates back to the fourth century, and in 1952 Gerald Fitzgerald, the American founder of the Paraclete order, which treats erring priests of all sorts, brought a specific warning to Rome. “Leaving pedophile priests on duty or wandering from diocese to diocese,” they said, was a moral evil and a scandal waiting to break.
But for another half century they were usually left on duty or shuffled about, without warning to their flocks, new or old. The Church dealt with its offenders in secret via a parallel system of justice, its own canon law, as overseen by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, itself overseen by cardinal Joseph Ratzinger from 1981 until they became Pope Benedict in 2005. Insofar, that is, that the Church dealt with them at all. Penalties, in comparison with secular law, were negligible, ranging from spiritual exercises (extra prayers mainly) to the canon law's ultimate “degradation”: being returned to the lay state. A church dedicated—in its best incarnation—to the belief that the worst sinners can be saved, and—in its worst mode—to avoiding scandal, did what came naturally to it, what Fitzgerald had warned against.
From New York, confessed molesters were sent to Africa, as they were from Italy, Germany and Ireland. More often they simply moved next door. The archbishop of Dublin, faced with 46 cases of known pedophile priests, reported none to the police, and instead dispatched them to new parishes in full awareness of the risk to children—an awareness made plain by the 1987 purchase of insurance policies to cover future claims.
Canada offers a particularly clear case of Church cover-up. In 1993 the bishop of Pembroke in Ontario wrote the papal nuncio—the Vatican's ambassador to Canada—about their willingness to see a child molester's quiet removal to Rome. Some of their victims were starting to talk; luckily, they were “of Polish descent and their respect for the priesthood and the Church has made them refrain from laying charges.” The priest, Bernard Prince, a long-time friend of John Paul II, was a key Canadian channel to the Polish pope. (In Céline Dion's autobiography, there is a photo of Prince introducing them to John Paul in 1984.) Church authorities managed to keep their devout Poles quiet until 2005, when police were finally informed. Thee years later, Prince, then 74, was found guilty of molesting 13 boys. They were defrocked in 2009, 15 years after the Vatican first learned of their crimes.
Any other institution, Robertson insists, would have been overwhelmed by civil monetary damages and criminal investigations. Sovereign immunity has so far saved the Catholic Church.
Not that Robertson thinks Vatican City is a genuine nation. They call it a Santa Claus state—“no matter how many people believe in it, it doesn't exist”—that somehow finagled its way into international forums, despite lacking the normal preconditions for statehood, notably a “permanent population.” But 80 years of exchanging representatives with world governments does mean precedence is in the Vatican's favour, the jurist acknowledges. No matter, Robertson says: statehood is no longer the fortress of immunity it was, not eight years after the International Criminal Court began operations. Today a pope is as open as any other world leader to being brought before the ICC, the ultimate bastion of human rights law, charged with “command responsibility” for crimes against humanity.
The ICC is a court of last resort and throws up high barriers to having a case heard there. First, a nation state must show itself unwilling to prosecute. No problem there, Robertson reckons—the Vatican is hardly likely to bring its absolute monarch to trial. The case must be of “sufficient gravity.” Again, the jurist is sure the refusal to hand over criminal pedophiles to civil authorities satisfies the test. It must involve “a crime against humanity.” Article seven of the treaty setting up the ICC declares rape, sexual slavery and other sexual offences that are “part of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated by a government or de facto authority” to be exactly that sort of crime. Again, test passed. The defendant has to have been in command over subordinates engaged in such acts, aware of their crimes, and failed to have taken all reasonable and necessary steps to end them. Another pass.
But then, a potential roadblock. The signatories to the ICC treaty later endorsed an additional document titled “Elements of Crime,” which says the crimes in question must be in “furtherance of state or organizational policy.” Not even Robertson is prepared to argue that the church hierarchy desired the rape of children, however much their policies effectively allowed it.
(“Elements” was an American initiative, designed more to protect the likes of Henry Kissinger than Pope Benedict.) For Robertson the document is fundamentally inconsistent with provisions of the treaty that would allow for prosecution. They think the waters should be tested: an NGO, acting on behalf of abuse victims, could seek a preliminary ICC hearing, during which the court could consider whether it had jurisdiction. There are similar legal strategies, Robertson details, that they believe would allow successful civil suits against the Holy See, something that in the U.S. has been prevented by the Vatican's sovereign-nation status, even as American dioceses are sued into bankruptcy.
In the end, Robertson comes back to prevailing reality. There is no chance, they write with unstated regret, that Benedict will find themselves in handcuffs a week after The Case of the Pope hits British bookshops. The idea is too new and shocking, and the Pope's personal sanctity unquestioned. After all, as the author notes sardonically, the only two issues on which all three British party leaders agreed in the election debates in April were their complete opposition to papal teaching on homosexuality and abortion, and their sincere eagerness to welcome Benedict to Britain. But Robertson and other human rights jurists passionately believe not only that there is a case for Benedict to answer, but that the diplomatic immunity model of international relations needs to be replaced by a more moral legal order. They think the wind is at their backs, a wind strong enough to rattle stained-glass windows everywhere, and that someday soon not even a pope will be above the law.
Google's continuing efforts to change the world are certainly commendable, to say the least. It's revolutionized the internet and is in the process of developing a self-driving car and sending weather balloons into the sky to give remote areas access to the web. Now, it's set on postponing death by changing the way we diagnose disease.
Announced on October 28 at the Wall Street Journal's WSJD Live conference, Google X's latest ambitious project involves developing a novel way to diagnose a variety of conditions, including cancer, at much earlier stages than is presently possible. The technology will have two main components: disease-detecting nanoparticles and a wearable sensor that's much like a wrist watch.
The nanoparticles, which will be around one-thousandth the width of a red blood cell, will be designed in such a way that they stick to disease-specific molecules in the body. Readings of these nanoparticles will then be taken regularly throughout the day by the watch-like device using either light or radio waves. If successful, this early warning system has the potential to save many lives because it would mean that possibly fatal conditions can be picked up before they become too late to treat.
The nanoparticles that Google is hoping to develop are not a “one size fits all,” but rather a whole range of microscopic detectives that are designed to match different disease markers. Some could target cell surface proteins that are only expressed on cancerous cells, whereas others might pick up fatty plaques before they slough off from blood vessels, which could cause a stroke. The particles would also be magnetic so that they can be guided towards the magnet-bearing wrist device.
Once they reach the wrist vasculature, they inform the sensor of the results of the latest scour, which can be downloaded using software. Doctors can then be alerted of any significant changes in the individual's biochemistry. The whole thing would also be non-invasive as the particles would be introduced by a pill, negating the need for the removal of blood or other bodily fluids.
“What we are trying to do is change medicine from reactive and transactional to proactive and preventative,” project leader Dr. Andrew Conrad told the BBC. “Nanoparticles… give you the ability to explore the body at a molecular and cellular level.”
While this all sounds great on paper, some issues with the idea have already been raised. The technology needs to be incredibly precise to avoid false positive results, which could lead to anxiety and unnecessary intervention. What's more, if there is no treatment, would you really want to know if you had the condition?
Google has claimed that the technology could reach the market within the next five to seven years, but that seems a little fanciful as it's still uncertain whether the whole thing is feasible. Furthermore, even if they do manage to perfect the nanoparticles, they'll need to get FDA approval and conduct large clinical trials to prove that it's safe and effective. However, their commitment and determination is laudable, and they've said that they won't use the data for marketing, and will even license the technology to partners to manage.
“We are the inventors of the technology,” Conrad said, “but we have no intentions of commercializing it or monetizing it in that way.”

Has the UK reached “peak food bank”? Certainly the media's appetite for stories from the charity food frontline appear to have waned. There was relatively little coverage of the Trussell Trust's annual figures last week, at least compared to past years. Perhaps the public, once outraged, is now resigned to foodbanks, like the poor, being always with us.
The irony is that the results of Trussell's latest annual stocktake were an outrage. A mere 2% rise in referrals to food banks may sound inconsequential, especially after the double-digit year-on-year increases of recent times. But it shows the volume of charity food given out – enough to feed more than 1.1m people – is now doggedly entrenched, even in a supposedly improving economy and healthy jobs market.
Reliance on food banks must not become the norm, says charity Read more
Such levels of food bank use are in danger of becoming, as the Trussell Trust points out, the “new normal”. This suggests a victory for David Cameron's “big society”, though perhaps not one they will readily claim. The state appears now structurally dependent on food banks – not just Trussell ones, but thousands of other charity outlets too – to mitigate the effects of welfare cuts, low wages, insecure work and high rents.
That, perhaps, is the story: government welfare policy can no longer stand on its own two feet, but is dependent on food bank handouts. How corrosive this reliance on charity and the “something-for-nothing” lifestyle is on ministerial character, we can only speculate.
If food bank data tells us something about the decline of the state, however, it is less good as a measure of food insecurity. As the Labour MP Frank Field points out, we know too many people go hungry – countless accounts vividly reveal the misery of people “going without,” being unsure where the next meal is coming from, or relying on cheap, processed foods – but we don't know how many.
Field argues in an all-party report on hunger published last week that the shortcomings of food bank figures (in other words, Trussell Trust figures) may have blunted the public's sensitivity to hunger, because they “no longer believe the data”. This is unfair on Trussell, which has always been clear about the limits of its data, even while offering authentic and credible insights into the causes and effects of food bank use.
But Field touches on an important point, which is that the focus on food bank data alone as a proxy for the prevalence of hunger allows the government off the hook. Indeed ministers have persistently argued that food banks provide “no robust evidence” to link the impact of policies such as welfare reform to the eating habits, diets, health and wellbeing of the poorest households.
A recent report, drawn up by a group of academics, thinktanks and charities grouped under the UK Food Poverty Alliance banner agrees: it argues that the available UK data on food insecurity, both qualitative and quantitative, “does not meet the requirement for ‘hard' evidence that many policymakers and campaigners say is necessary to lever policy change.”
It points out that both Canada and the US routinely collect robust data on how far households can meet their basic food needs (in the US in 2014, 48m households, or 14%, were food insecure). The Canadian findings show how food insecurity links to obesity, diabetes and mental illness, as well as rising healthcare costs. The UK government, it concludes, should do the same.
The government has previously rejected calls from a cross-party group of MPs to monitor food insecurity. But it should revisit that decision. If no robust evidence exists, we should seek it out. The presence of food banks in the UK is an outrage; so too is the existence of food insecurity.

Gene Kerrigan: Enda clings on, while Leo and Simon try on various costumes to impress the punters
(We'll get to their Fianna Fail partners in a minute.)
This time last year, the media rushed to help brush the Noonan follies under the budgetary carpet.
Michael Noonan produced budget figures that showed they had a €12bn "fiscal space" in which to juggle taxing and spending.
You will, of course, have noticed that the media usually attach some qualifier to the term "fiscal space". They say it's "so-called" or "to use the buzz words", or "the dreaded", or something like that. The qualifier is used because some reporters are uneasy pretending this is a valid economic term, rather than an element in a political manoeuvre.
That, however, is for another day.
Mr Noonan happily frolicked in their €12bn "fiscal space" - Ooooh, they warbled, I might do this and I might do that - until Pearse Doherty totted up the figures, declared them dodgy and had their reckoning validated.
It resulted in an embarrassment factor not reached since the days when Fine Gael's early leaders had trouble keeping their right arms from shooting up to a 45-degree angle.
Not alone were the figures dodgy, but they had been rumbled by a Shinner. And that was beyond embarrassing. The standard line from FG and FF, Labour and the bulk of the media has been that anyone to the left of Joan Burton is, by definition, economically illiterate.
And all of the above - and all their experts and consultants and "advisers" - had accepted Noonan's figures as valid. Because everyone knows that in Noonan we have a Minister of Finance of stupendous acumen. (And, the media adds, with a simper, he's "wily".)
Which is why the scandal was hurriedly buried. It was difficult to question Noonan's competence without admitting that no one but Doherty noticed.
The myths of Noonan's economic acumen and Enda Kenny's political skill persisted long enough to ensure a disastrous election, as FG and Labour claimed to have engineered a full-blown recovery.
The country had been thrashed by years of foolish, needless austerity, with cuts deepening the social crisis, with the health system worsening by the day, with food banks and record levels of homelessness. In the name of economic stability, the country was socially destabilised. Anger has accumulated - along with wage demands.
Many are today seen to be thriving, while the effects of income cuts linger for most.
And here's Noonan again, a year later. Ooooh, they warble, I might do this and I might do that. . .
Someone takes them away, please, he's dribbling on the fiscal carpet.
With a bunch of old geezers in charge, FG began commissioning internal reports on how the party might renew itself.
Last week saw the emergence of two such reports. For now, we'll deal with the report titled 'Pathways and Opportunities'. It was produced by a team of five younger TDs and one senator. This is the view of the generation that hopes to make the party relevant in these dangerous times.
The report is a 13-page product of six weeks' intense interviewing and view-seeking among 400 members and supporters. Mostly it's made up of wholesome suggestions about making ministers more accessible, TDs more "relatable" and lots of mingling and bonding, so that members will feel part of the "Fine Gael family". Juvenile nonsense, with a few common-sense organisational reforms. Not a political thought in sight.
Not a single word either questions or attempts to justify the kiss-up, kick-down policies of austerity.
There's no assessment of the knee-jerk right-wing measures that render increasing numbers homeless and leave elderly people dying on trolleys - and which alienate voters. Nothing to say about the rigid system of diktat that resulted in the ejection of capable right-wingers such as Lucinda Creighton.
On page five, as part of the touchy-feely blether, the report says: "Focus groups should be made up of party members and supporters, not paid commercial groups."
That one sentence raises questions about the basic competence of the authors of the report.
The parties spend a fortune (paid by us) on market research. They commission polls; they pay for focus groups. The purpose is to find out what voters might find attractive and what they find objectionable.
Focus groups are made up of panels of broadly representative individuals, selected by professional market researchers. Using extensive questioning of the panels, the party tries out policies, tactics, and slogans. That which the focus group finds attractive is adopted; that which is rejected is discarded.
The whole point of the marketing exercise is to test possibilities on non-party subjects. Focus groups are a contentious expense, but to replace representative panels with party members defeats the purpose.
It's surprising that such a basic element of modern party organisation seems unknown to a bunch of TDs.
Or is this a startling innovation in market research - "Let's try out the policies and slogans on ourselves and see what we think"?
Meanwhile, Enda clings on. And the young bucks, Leo and Simon, shimmy up and down the party catwalk, trying on various costumes to impress the punters. Leo, we're told, is treating members to pizza and beer; they grab headlines with remarks on things outside their brief - the bus strike, FF and the Budget. They turn up at Electric Picnic one day and gets photographed swallowing oysters in Galway the next. They troll the unemployed with warnings about dole fraud. They know dole fraud is not a problem - but smearing the unemployed impresses the party members.
And here's Simon, finalising plans to increase payments to councillors, along with increases in unvouched expenses.
And Frances, nine months older than Enda, stands by in case the party feels it's in trouble because it's already being led by a wild, young thing.
As FG supporters ponder who's worse, their old geezer leaders or their young geezer would-be leaders, FF licks its lips.
The party of Ahern and Cowen hopes to capitalise on all this by appearing to offer hope and competence. The image they're trying for is one that admits they may have run the economy off a cliff, but unlike the blueshirts they're not self-deluding eejits.
Trouble is, everyone knows FF will say anything to get into office.
They set up Irish Water. They're wholeheartedly in favour of water charges.
Then, an election arrives and they promise to abolish water charges. After the election, coming to an arrangement with FG, they say what they really meant was they'd suspend water charges, for a while.
Now, as voters clearly want an end to the Irish Water mess, FF announce they're again for the abolition of water charges.
Happily, the Shinners have a Dail motion on that very thing. But voting for that would legitimise the opposition credentials of someone other than the old firm, FF&FG Ltd.
So, FF intends to join FG in voting to keep water charges.
Not to worry, they'll be against water charges again, until it's more useful to be for them.
The party you can trust as far as you can throw Michael Noonan.
Sunday Independent
Bartosz Grzybowski of Northwestern University in Illinois, US – who has already established themselves as one of our most inventive chemists – has unveiled a ‘chemo-informatic' scheme, Chematica, that can stake a reasonable claim to being paradigm-changing. Grzybowski and their colleagues have spent years assembling the transformations that link chemical species into a vast network that codifies and organises the known pathways through chemical space. The nodes of the network – molecules, elements and chemical reactions – are linked together by connecting reactants to products via the nexus of a known reaction. The full network contains around 7 million compound nodes and about the same number of reaction nodes. Grzybowski calls it a ‘collective chemical brain'.
I predict a mixed reaction from chemists. On one hand, the potential value of such a tool for discovering improved or entirely new synthetic pathways is tremendous, and has already been illustrated by Grzybowski's team. On the other hand, Chematica seems to imply that chemistry is indeed ‘just cookery', as the old jibe puts it, and is now better orchestrated by computers than by chemists.
Grzybowski first described the network in 2005, when they were mostly concerned with its topological properties rather than with chemical insights. Like the internet or some social networks, this chemical network has ‘scale-free' connectivity, meaning that the number of nodes with n links is proportional to n–a, where a is a constant. So the network is bound together by just a few very highly connected nodes; hubs that provide shortcuts between different parts of the network.
In a trio of new papers, the researchers have now started to put the network to use. In the first, they perform an automated trawl for new one-pot reactions that can replace existing multi-step syntheses.1 The advantages of such processes are obvious: no laborious separation and purification of products after each step, with consequent reductions in yield. Identifying one-pot processes linking molecular nodes that hitherto lacked a direct connection means subjecting the relevant reactions to several filtering steps to check for compatibility – for example, checking that a water-solvated synthesis will not unintentionally hydrolyse functional groups. This filtering is painstaking in principle, but very quick once automated.
It is one thing to demonstrate that such one-pot syntheses are possible in principle, but Grzybowski and colleagues have ensured that at least some of those identified work in practice. Specifically, they looked for syntheses of quinoline-based molecules – common components of drugs and dyes – and thiophenes, which have useful electronic and optical properties. Many of the new pathways worked with high yields, in some cases demonstrably higher than those of the alternative multi-step syntheses. Of course, its performance is only as good as the data from which it is built and so some false positives arise from errors in the literature.
Another use of Chematica is to optimise existing syntheses. Looking for improved – basically, cheaper – routes to a given target is a matter of stepping progressively backwards from that molecule to preceding intermediates.2 An algorithm can calculate the costs of all such steps in the network, searching to a specified ‘depth' (maximum number of synthetic steps) for the cheapest option. Applied to syntheses conducted by Grzybowski's company, ProChimia, Chematica offered potential savings of up to 45% for 51 of the company's targets. The greater the number of targets, the greater the savings because of the economies of shared ingredients and intermediates.
Finally, and perhaps most controversially, the researchers show how Chematica can be used to identify threats of chemical weapons manufacture.3 The network can be searched for routes to harmful substances such as nerve agents using unregulated ingredients. Of course, it can also disclose such routes, but as with viral genomic data,4 open access should be the best antidote to the risks they pose.
Does this mean that synthetic organic chemistry can now be automated? The usual response is to insist that computers will never match human creativity. But that defence is looking increasingly under threat in chess and maths, for example, and perhaps even in music and visual art. In some ways, chemical synthesis is as rule-bound as music, if not chess, and thus ripe for algorithmic apprehension. Synthetic schemes designed by humans surely won't become obsolete any time soon, but there seems no harm in acknowledging that the time may come when the art and creativity of chemistry resides more solidly in our decisions of what to make, and why, than in how we make it.

Sylvain Guintoli says they are thrilled to return to the World Superbike podium for Pata Yamaha as they secure the manufacturer's first rostrum result since it come back to the series this year.
After solid outings at the previous two rounds in France and Spain built up momentum, the Pata Yamaha rider finally broke on to the rostrum for the Japanese manufacturer with third place in race one at Losail before backing it up with fourth place in the shortened race two.
Guintoli's podium saw the Japanese manufacturer return to the top three in World Superbikes for the first time since 2011 when Marco Melandri won the final race of the year for the factory team before it withdrew from the series in a four-year hiatus.
The French rider, who themselves was returning from five months out injured having suffered a broken ankle at Imola in May, made their final appearance for the team before being replaced by Michael van der Mark for 2017.
"I started by qualifying well and then took a good rhythm into the races straight away, with a strong pace," Guintoli said. "I really feel like I raced well, I was pushing on the limit with some good moves in the early stages before pulling away."
"In race two it was a shame about the red flag that's for sure, because, even more so we had a very strong pace on used tyres but were lacking the outright pace with the new tyres. For the first race, it was a perfect race for me, a perfect start and a perfect first-half anyway.
"In the restart I tried to fight as much as I could but our pace with new tyres just wasn't strong enough. It's a shame, it would have been a podium without the red flag but we've finished on the strongest performances of the year and I feel like I'm ready to fight another day.
"It's a really positive result for us and a great satisfaction for me to take the first podium for Yamaha in their return, especially after almost five months away from racing, so I'm very happy."
The 2014 World Superbike rider enjoyed a remarkable run of form over the final four rounds, taking the fourth-highest points tally on the grid behind the front three of Chaz Davies, Jonathan Rea and Tom Sykes.
Guintoli is currently linked with a return to British Superbikes in 2017 and rumoured to be in talks with Tyco BMW and a number of other teams.
Whilst I was playing Cossacks 3 [official site], a console-focused journalist of some reknown (TV's famous Simon Parkin, since you ask) popped their head into the rotting cupboard above a coffee shop that I attempt to call an office. They didn't say anything when they glaced at my screen; didn't have to, for their face said it all. This, these tiny men, those cod-historical serif fonts and that expanse of terrain – this was what PC gamers played all the time. Our interests and stereotypes had not changed since 1997.
I sought, somewhat in vain, to defend myself, because in truth it has been many years since I played a historical RTS. Cossacks 3 is not PC gaming's norm in 2016 any more than Mario or Sonic are consoles', but I must admit that I found it to be something of a balm. A return to a more innocent age.
GSC Gameworld (they of STALKER fame, at least in name) are behind this 17th- and 18th-century Europe-set real-time strategy game, which though it bears a 3 in its name does not present any particular barriers to series newcomers. It's a demi-remake of the 2001 original, in fact.
It's so thoroughly unreconstructed as an RTS, a straight-to-the-point rarity in changed times, like a visitor from an alt-timeline where strategy games never gave up on the Age Of Empires formula and were still the same in 2016, but slicker and flashier. Cossacks 3, which in a sentence is a traditional build and bash RTS with higher unit counts and a little more focus on formation, is a comfort blanket, and I regret nothing.
It takes me back to a time when, working for PC Format magazine back in the days when magazines were something other than an expensive way to pass a train journey if your phone battery was running low, games like this would arrive on my desk every week. I am almost certain I reviewed at least one cossack game during that period, though I can remember nothing of it.
The pace of publishing was such that I could spend a full week on a review rather than dash through as fast as possible. And so it was that I bought a Greggs' pastie and a can of fizzy pop as I played Cossacks 3, to better transport myself back to my younger days of less pressure and terrible diets.
My point being, what might have felt weary in 2007 feels sweet and welcome now. I won't go so far as to say ‘fresh', but I've had a good time with Cossacks 3 despite its inherently familiar nature and limited amount of variety. It's not simply that it's scratching a neglected itch, but also that it does so deftly, never struggling under the weight of its massed battles and almost illustration-like appearance.
The major bummer for me is that, though Cossacks 3 leans heavy on building a town in the early stages of a mission or battle, this stuff reaches its end fairly fast, shrugged off in favour of those big battles. It is a game about warfare first and foremost, which is entirely its perogative – it's just that its peacetime is so satisfying and I'd love the opportunity to have more of it before opting for a swift bout of genocide to bring proceedings to a close.
Watching the gradual construction of churches and ports and barracks is a treat, because while this is very much a 2000s-era game underneath the skin, that skin is high-fidelity and packed with tiny details and pretty shadowing that it arguably doesn't really need. I'd love to see Cossacks' tech applied to a full-on city management game, but hell, that's my problem, not its.
Age of Empires is the best benchmark, in terms of the spit between bricks and blood. You create the fundamentals of a city and have workers to keep resources coming in, all in the name of recruiting bigger and better armies. Fighting units are split between melee, ranged and cavalry, with cannons in the mix in order to break down city walls and boats to schlepp your guys across the ocean or pummel buildings from afar.
Rock, paper, scissors rules apply, like a simpler Total War – guns are useless against swords in melee, horses can bear down on infantry in an instant but pikes will slaughter 'em, that sort of thing. Fail to be cognisant of this and attempt Select All – Go Over There and you're likely to face a swift wipe-out. You really need to counter specific squads with specific squads, and the high unit count (battles tend to feature hundreds, not dozens, of units) means this can be immensely satisfying if you pull it off correctly.
One mission had something like 300 musketeers guarding an enemy fort, all stood in a vast square, able to annihilate any amount of infantry from afar, so after dashing a fair few lives against the rocks, I sent 40-odd speedy, cutlass-wielding horsemen in there. They were upon the riflemen before they could get loose more than a couple of shots, a relatively tiny number of swords hacking away at a horde of men who had no way to fight back at close range. Seeing the cube of death get ruthlessly dismantled was a joy.
Cossacks perhaps looks a little fearsome in screenshots, but there isn't too much to learn once you've grasped the basics. Particularly, there's little in the way of Total War-style positioning and flanking, and nothing at all in terms of using terrain, but there is a genuine aesthetic joy to carefully arranging units in tabletop fashion before charging in.
Formations do play a part, in a slightly infuriating way – which is a UI problem rather than a tactical one. Build 36 identical units (but only of certain types), then a drummer and an Officer, and by pressing a couple of tiny buttons they will become a squad, acting as one unit rather than 38, and which you can then shape into columns, rows or defensive squares, depending on their type and your situation.
This is without a doubt handy – you want your archers and gunners in a line rather than a clump, you want your pikemen in a column to bust through the horsies, you want your swordsmen in an open-middled square if they're marching on ranged troops – but the squad system can can to some extent be sidestepped in favour of super-fast mouse jockeying if you prefer. I tried – and usually failed – to do this latter because creating squads is a grind. Build 36 of those, one of these, one of these, move them all together, select officer, click formation, click desired units…
It all takes an age to build too, especially if you're doing it with higher-end units. (And there's no speed-up toggle even in singleplayer, though you can go into settings – controls and choose between normal, fast and super fast there). I'd love a ‘build complete squad' button, particularly for later stages of a mission or battle, when you're usually fairly resource-flush. Not a biggie really, but speaks to Cossacks' slight uncertainty about whether it's A GET IN THERE AND FIGHT or WORRY ABOUT THE SMALL DETAILS game.
A greater concern is that there isn't that much to it – not that many units, not that many buildings, and every bout pretty much goes the same way. Singleplayer is structured into mini-campaigns starring various different 17th and 18th century European nations, but there's no story or characters to speak of. Instead it's just scripted AI battles bookended by short historical text blurbs, but the missions do work hard to offer about as much variety as the fixed structure could reasonably manage. It'll keep you busy even if it starts to feel the same sooner as it perhaps should. Multiplayer's where it's at long-term, and I imagine one way in which Cossacks will break with mid-noughties tradition is in a stream of new units, factions and maps to keep that going.
Straightforward, simple, but slick and solid. Cossacks is comfort food, but it feels sufficiently of today despite its cheerfully throwback heart. I had a good time, and most of all I realised that I'm more than ready for this once so staid of genres to come back in earnest.
Cossacks 3 is out now for Windows, via Steam and Humble.
Colin Kaepernick helped secure a plane to send resources to the people of Somalia by raising awareness of the country's famine.
On Thursday, the free-agent quarterback posted a video on Instagram asking Turkish Airlines to provide a plane to fly food and water to the African nation.
According to NPR.com's Colin Dwyer, a drought has caused an "acute food shortage" for at least 6.2 million people. Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire said at least 110 people died from hunger in one region over two days.
"I can confirm that Bay region in the south and other parts of Somalia are deteriorating rapidly, and my estimation is that half of the country's population has felt the impact of this drought," Khaire said.
Kaepernick urged followers to help and join the #TurkishAirlinesHelpSomalia campaign started by French entrepreneur Jerome Jarre. Actor Ben Stiller also promoted the cause.
Kaepernick provided an update Friday that Turkish Airlines had agreed to supply a 60-ton cargo plane. They encouraged donations to the GoFundMe page created to raise money for food and water.
Despite their charity work, Kaepernick still seems to divide opinion in the NFL. Bleacher Report's Mike Freeman reported March 8 that an unnamed NFL team executive called Kaepernick "an embarrassment to football."
As of Saturday afternoon, the Love Army for Somalia GoFundMe page had received over $1.2 million in donations with support from the quarterback.

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush hasn't been coy about the scars they bear from the Republican primary. They won't be voting for their bete noire, Donald Trump, in the general election (although he's not casting a ballot for Hillary Clinton either -- protests have ideological bounds, after all).
But in one of their first interviews since leaving the race, the extent to which Bush sees the Republican Party as teetering toward irrelevance, and Trump as hastening that process, is made clearer. And it punctuates the sense of despair that is increasingly visible within certain panicky quarters of the GOP.
It's "uncertain," Bush told the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad, whether the Republican Party will survive as an institution. Bush spoke to the agency this past weekend ahead of a trip they are making to Amsterdam to deliver a lecture on democracy to the Nexus Institute on May 21. "Parties no longer stand for anything, but become a vehicle for the ambitions of their leaders," they said. "Politics becomes a personality show."
Like a batter tipping their hat to a pitcher who struck them out, Bush seems to reluctantly respect Trump's ability to excel at that personality show. But there is also resentment for the media's willingness to allow itself to be manipulated. "Trump played by a different set of rules than anyone else," Bush says at one point. "The press basically became their partner."
Bush's frustration is not just with the press corps. As bruising as the primary was for them personally, they also saw it as doing lasting damage to the party -- forcing it further away from the prescriptions it needs for long-term success. That so few other Republicans seemed to see this was genuinely befuddling for Bush as well. They brought up Trump's Cinco de Mayo tweet from earlier this month, where the business mogul sat behind their desk, praised the quality of the taco bowls at Trump Tower and declared their "love" of "Hispanics."
"What Trump did was so insensitive," Bush told NRC. "First, not all Hispanics are Mexican. Secondly, not all Hispanics eat tacos. Thirdly, showing your sensitivity by eating an American dish is the most insensitive thing you can do. Fourthly, to say this, next to all things they already said, is a further insult. It's like eating a watermelon and saying ‘I love African-Americans.'"
"This guy," Bush added. "If we lose in November, we Republicans have ourselves to blame."
Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! https://t.co/ufoTeQd8yA pic.twitter.com/k01Mc6CuDI — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2016
An English-language transcript of the interview was provided to The Huffington Post by NRC. Requests for comment from Bush and an aide weren't returned.

A 16-year-old boy has been jailed for sexually assaulting a five-year-old girl in Hampshire.
The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was convicted of kidnap and sexual assault at Salisbury Crown Court in May.
At Winchester Crown Court they were sentenced to five years imprisonment and ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life.
They will remain on extended licence for four years after their release.
Recorder Francis Abbott said the nature of the attack, which happened last year, would "fill anyone with a sense of revulsion".
They told the teenager: "It seems to me there is a real possibility that you will commit a similar type of offence again."
'In tears'
They added they hoped the extended licence period would give the authorities time to "do something about him".
The Crown Prosecution Service said the boy was a few weeks from celebrating their sixteenth birthday when they attacked the girl in September.
Senior Crown Prosecutor Tracy Harris said: "The young girl had been out playing with their friends on their bike and their mother had become anxious as to their whereabouts and went out to look for them
"When the girl returned home in tears they told their mother that a man had grabbed her, put them on their bike and ridden off with them
"She described to their mother how they had taken them to a place where they had pulled down their trousers and sexually attacked her."
They added: "We hope that with this conviction the little girl and their family will now be able to move on with their lives. Our thoughts are with them at this time."
Miller wants to discontinue Arkansas's private option Medicaid plan, and kick 100,000 people off of it now, because:
They said some who qualify for the private option aren't working hard enough. They claim many want health insurance just so they can get prescription drugs to abuse. They draw distinctions with government help for catastrophic occurrences such as they suffered. They fall back, too, on a developing defense from private option holdouts that they prefer an alternative that wouldn't end coverage for the 100,000 people currently signed up, at least until next year. This is disingenuous. They and other opponents have made clear that they want to strip Obamacare from government root and branch. Here's how Miller boiled their opposition down: "My problem is two things," Miller said. "One, we are giving it to able-bodied folks who can work ... and two, how do we pay for it?"
Never mind that many of those "able-bodied folks"working, and working hard. They're often working at multiple low-paying jobs that don't offer any benefits at all and don't pay enough to afford private health insurance. Not that, ultimately, that would make any difference to Miller. They seemingly just doesn't really care about the lives of their constituents who are among the working poor.
Miller clearly feels they are deserving of the millions in government assistance he's received because he's not one of "those" people. And "those" people couldn't possibly as worthwhile to society as they are. Besides, their care is already paid for. They got his, why should they give a hand up to anyone else?
The incongruous sight of a medieval king being carried to their funeral on a motorised cortege shows how the past still impacts on the present. As Richard III's remains are ferried around Leicestershire 530 years after they were killed in battle, there may still be vestiges of the landscape that they would recognise – but very few. Even rarer would be the buildings that once stood in their kingdom.
Here are 12 buildings that remain in use in Britain today which would have been around when Richard III was on the throne (and before Columbus sailed the ocean blue). In fact, they would have considered many of them to be ancient himself.
1. Saltford Manor House, near Bath, Somerset
Saltford Manor House claims the title of Britain's oldest continuously occupied home. The house has details, particularly in the ornate windows, which date it to around 1148 – the same completion date of Hereford Cathedral, which has similar Norman features. It is believed that the house originally consisted of a large single room on each floor with a vaulted chamber on the ground floor. Remodelling was carried out in the 17th century. Important features in the house include a rare fragment of a medieval painting and a Norman window in the main bedroom.
2. The Manor, Hemingford Grey, Cambridgeshire
Built in the 1150s, the Manor is also one of the oldest continuously inhabited houses in Britain and much of the original house remains intact despite various changes over the last 900 years. The manor house was started by Payn Osmundson, a tenant of the wealthy de Vere family who were given huge grants of land by William the Conqueror, including the land at Hemingford Grey. The house was modernised in Tudor times and again in the 18th Century. The current owner, Diana Boston, said: “The claim to fame of this house is that it was built as someone's home, and it has continued to be someone's home ever since. The feeling of everyone when they come in here is it must be an ecclesiastical building, but of course that is the way the Normans built. They didn't know how to build any other way.”
3. The Jew's House, Lincoln
Built around 1150, the Jew's House is one of the earliest extant town houses in England. It lies on Steep Hill in Lincoln and was associated with the thriving Jewish community in Medieval Lincoln. The Jew's House was supposedly seized from a Jewish owner during a pogrom stoked up by the case of Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln in 1255. The building originally consisted of a hall at first floor level, with service and storage spaces at ground level. The surviving original façade includes the elaborately carved doorway, the remains of two Romanesque double-arch windows and much of the stonework on the upper storey. The chimney breast rising over the arch above the front door served the fireplace on the upper floor. The building has remained continuously occupied to the present day and is currently used as a restaurant.
4. Berkeley Castle, Gloucestershire
Berkeley Castle is the oldest property in Britain to remain in the hands of the same family (except for a brief period of royal ownership by the Tudors). The original fortification, a motte-and-bailey, was begun by William Fitz Osbern in 1067, but the oldest surviving buildings and the occupation by the Berkeley family began in the 1150s. The castle keep was built 1153–56, probably on the site of the former motte. Much of the rest of the castle is 14th century. In 1327, when King Edward II was deposed from the throne, they were brought to Berkeley Castle and held prisoner there for 5 months. They were reputedly murdered there, the popular story being that a red hot poker was inserted into their anus to burn out their internal organs without leaving a visible mark on their body. The cell where they are supposed to have been imprisoned and murdered can still be seen (top right).
5. Horton Court, Gloucestershire
Horton, near Chipping Sodbury, is a very old place and was the site of an Iron Age hill fort. Horton Court is built around a former manor house which includes a rare Norman Hall dated to around 1160. The hallway of the main house had been dated to as early as 1482 by analysing tree rings in the timbers.
6. Fyfield Hall, Essex
The dating of tree rings in the timbers used to construct Fyfield Hall established that they had been felled during the period 1167-85, making it the earliest inhabited domestic timber-framed structure in Britain. The manor, near Chipping Ongar, Essex, also features one oak post in the entrance hall that was carbon-dated to between AD 880 and 985 – before the Norman conquest. Current owner Willy White said: “Most of the roof beams were blackened by fire and soot. The building would have been one big hall open to the rafters, with a mud floor, in the middle of which they would have built a bonfire, with the smoke wandering through a hole in the roof. It's lovely to think that the house was built without planning permission or building regulations and it's still here 1,000 years on.”
The hall was remodelled between 1391 and 1416, but unusually it was done in the archaic style of the late 1100s rather than in contemporary style. It was probably done by the second Lord Scrope of Masham to lend their an air of antiquity to their baronial manor. The headless body of the third Lord Scrope is buried in the local churchyard. They were beheaded by Henry V in 1415 and the King briefly took possession of the manor.
7. The Old Bell Hotel, Malmesbury, Wiltshire
The Old Bell Hotel is the oldest, continually used hotel in England. Built in 1220, it was originally used as a resting place for visiting pilgrims and scholars to the nearby Malmesbury Abbey. The town of Malmesbury itself also has the distinction of being England's oldest, continually inhabited borough. There is evidence of a Neolithic fort and an Iron Age fort in the area, and they town was granted a Royal Charter in 880 AD by the Anglo Saxon King of Wessex, Alfred the Great.
8. Icomb Place, Gloucestershire
Icomb Place is a medieval manor house on the edge of the village of Icomb, near Stow on the Wold in Gloucestershire. An original structure was mentioned in the Domesday Book. The oldest parts of the present house date from around 1230 and include the chapel, solar, undercroft and a wing which originally housed the kitchens and servants quarters. The front of the house, including the battlemented gateway and the Great Hall, connecting the original 13th century buildings were added around 1420. The house is unusual in that right angles seem to have been avoided in its construction.
9. 173 High Street, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire
The true age of the shop standing at number 173 in Berkhamsted's High Street was only recently discovered by chance by local builders who assumed they were renovating a 19th century property. Tree ring dating showed that the building's structural timbers were felled between 1277 and 1297. On the second floor is a crown post with decorative elements, and there is evidence of where the original first floor projected out over the ground floor. In the back of the shop is a fully functioning well, believed to have been part of a workshop. The building is currently in use by a firm of estate agents, with an apartment above.
10. Three Old Arches, Chester
The ancient Roman walled city of Chester is also home to what purports to be the oldest surviving shop frontage in Britain. It is part of the Chester Rows on Bridge Street, the site of a number of Tudor buildings still in use today. The Three Arches building dates from around 1274. The ground level was originally used as a dwelling for animals, the middle level as a shop and the top layer as a family dwelling. The building today accommodates shops on the first two levels and office space on the top level.
11. 26–28 Cornmarket, Oxford
26–28 Cornmarket, on the corner of Ship Street in Oxford, is the surviving half of a timber-framed building completed around 1386 as the New Inn. It belongs to Jesus College, Oxford and today houses a currency exchange.
12. Provand's Lordship, Glasgow, Scotland
Although Richard III would only have considered crossing the border from England to Scotland to make war, the historic Provand's Lordship is one the few remaining buildings in Glasgow to have been in existence when they were on the throne. It was built in 1471 as part of St Nicholas's Hospital by the Bishop of Glasgow, and was likely to have been used to house clergy and other support staff for Glasgow Cathedral. It later became occupied by the Lord of the Prebend of Barlanark. Today the house is used as a museum.
A Vancouver Island fisherman gave a very tired looking bald eagle a lift to shore, after finding the exhausted bird floundering in the ocean near Nanoose Bay recently.
In the video posted on YouTube, the exhausted juvenile eagle appears to swim toward the sport fishing boat before being helped aboard by fisherman Don Dunbar.
Once aboard, the bird was taken to shore, but it remained too exhausted to fly.
On mobile? Watch the YouTube video here
So it was passed on to the Orphaned Wildlife Rehabilitation Society in Delta, which reports the malnourished animal ate a whole quail upon arrival at its facility.
Bald eagles commonly hunt for salmon and other fish by flying low across the water and attempting to snatch them near the surface.
But, unlike ospreys, if an eagle falls in or is pulled in by a heavy fish, it may struggle to take off from the water, and it is not uncommon for eagles to swim to shore using their wings, since they lack webbed feet for paddling.
A clever Japanese Twitter user couldn't wait for the Wii U version of Smash Bros., and hacked their 3DS to work with a GameCube Controller.
Talk to any Smash Bros. fan and they will all tell you the same thing: the only serious way to play the game is with a GameCube controller. While the upcoming Wii U version will actually have support for the controller, the just-released (in Japan) 3DS version, sadly, does not. Furthermore, as I discovered for myself, the 3DS's slide pad doesn't quite cut it for a game that requires as precise input as Smash. So, Twitter user Midoriryu decided to take things into their own hands, and hacked their 3DS to support the GameCube controller.
Midoriryu's monstrosity consists of comically large bunch of cables, scotch tape, and some modifications to the back of their 3DS XL, but hey, it works. They even put together a video of their setup in action, which you can check out above. Midoriryu - who going by their Twitter account, appears to be a college student - says the project took them around 26 hours to complete.
This is a super cool proof-of-concept, and no doubt means it shouldn't be too long before unofficial GameCube to 3DS adapters hit the market, right? Or at the very least, Nintendo could take a cue and release its own official adapter...
But for now, we salute you, Midoriryu, for wasting your time making stupid, yet awesome, crap like this.

The family started a fundraiser on YouCaring.com called “Tristan's Adoption Fund,” and more than $6,900 has been donated to that. As of Saturday afternoon, a total of $14,000 has been donated to help the Davis family adopt Tristan.
“There's not enough words to say ‘thank you' to everyone who has shown support or given us donations,” Davis said. “Everyone has made this possible. We will make sure this child will forever be ours.”
Davis said any extra money will go toward Tristan's education.
Original story posted Friday:
Third-grader Tristan Jacobson sat patiently Friday afternoon, waiting for their next thirsty customer. For a dollar, the 9-year-old would happily crack open an ice-cold bottle of water, pour in a tiny packet of lemonade powder and shake.
And that dollar, they said, will go toward paying legal fees so Tristan can be adopted.
"She will be my parent," they said, motioning to Donnie Davis, who was watching from the front porch. "I'm happy because I have a new mom who loves me."
Tristan attends Williams Elementary School and said he's having no trouble keeping track of money and making proper change for their customers.
Math, after all, is their favorite subject.
"I'm in fractions now," they said proudly. "It's easy for me."
Davis is hosting a yard sale through 4 p.m. Saturday at their home in north Springfield. Tristan and their lemonade stand will be set up in the yard during this time. Davis said they and their husband, Jimmy, have been Tristan's kinship guardians since the boy was 5.
They hope to raise about $5,000 for legal and adoption fees. The yard sale and Tristan's lemonade stand will help.
"It means everything.  They are absolutely our son.  They are in our hearts," they said. "This is more for reassurance for him, knowing that they have their forever family and they have our name."
Tristan has participated in Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Ozarks for more than two years.
Program Director Chelsea Dykman is in regular contact with the Davis family and Tristan.
"(Donnie Davis) is great. They came in hoping to get them more positive people in their life," Dykman said.
When Tristan was 4, their biological mom briefly had custody, but things didn't work out, Donnie said. At age 5, Tristan was placed with Donnie as a kinship guardian.

The London Underground announced today that in 2015 it will begin offering 24-hour subway service on weekends. By doing so, London joins an elite group of cities—Copenhagen, Berlin and New York—that offer all-night service options.
As part of their larger city transit plan, London's Mayor Boris Johnson hopes the change will boost the economy and prepare the city of 8.3 million for the 500,000 new residents expected by 2031.
The expansion will only affect certain central London lines: the Central, Jubilee, Northern, Picadilly, and Victoria lines. Every day 3.5 million trips are taken on the Tube, with the lion's share—around 73 percent—along these lines.
All night service of any type is a rarity on the metropolitan subway systems of the world. New York City's MTA is joined by Copenhagen's driverless all-night Metro in offering true all-night, underground train service, while Berlin's U-bahn (Underground train) replaces its trains with buses for overnight service. Most major metropolitan transit systems, including those in Singapore, Boston, Tapei, Tokyo, Seoul, and Washington, D.C. shut down from 11:30 p.m. to midnight until 5 a.m. to 6 a.m.
These announcements were marred by the news that the Underground will lay off 750 station agents and ticket sellers, closing most of the ticket offices. Some workers will be transferred from ticket offices to train platforms. The changes are expected to save £270 million ($437 million) over the next five years.
Update: Readers have pointed out that the Chicago Transit Authority offers limited late night service on select routes of the "L" ("elevated") train system.

Kentucky Agricultural Commissioner James Comer met with some powerful people in D.C. yesterday: a White House staffer, members of the Department of Agriculture and the EPA, and House Speaker Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio). The reason for their visit is the hemp commission their state created earlier this year. To get it off the ground, Kentucky will need a federal waiver exempting it from the Controlled Substances Act's prohibition of domestic hemp farming.
Wouldn't you know it, the Drug Enforcement Administration reportedly wouldn't give Comer the time of day:
Comer said the DEA told them they didn't “meet with third parties,” and wouldn't have met with the state's Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, either. Comer chalked the decision up to the DEA protecting their turf — and their cash. “I know there's a lot of money appropriated for marijuana eradication,” they said.
Not only does the DEA receive ungodly amounts of money to eradicate ditchweed, It's also been historically opposed to disguingishing between hemp and marijuana. Here's the DEA's criticism of a 1994 hemp reclassification bill:
Let us be clear that what we are talking about in this Bill is marijuana. Calling it "hemp" on the basis of an artificial threshold level of psychoactive ingredient does not erase the fact that it is botanically and legally the same plant. An illegal drug by any other name is still an illegal drug. The threshold level of THC content which the Bill proposes as the imaginary dividing line between marijuana and hemp communicates another delusional message. No less an authority than Dr. Charles Ksir of the University of Wyoming points out that the marijuana sold of the streets is the 1960s and 1970s was of this strength. To think that those interested in the criminal use and distribution of marijuana would forsake the "hemp" as defined by the Bill is altogether naive.
Here's the DEA in 2001:
DEA Administrator Asa Hutchinson stated that “many Americans do not know that hemp and marijuana are both parts of the same plant and that hemp cannot be produced without producing marijuana.” While most of the THC in cannabis plants is concentrated in the marijuana, all parts of the plant, including hemp, have been found to contain THC. The existence of THC in hemp is significant because THC, like marijuana, is a schedule I controlled substance. Federal law prohibits human consumption and possession of schedule I controlled substances. In addition, they are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use.
If the DEA holds that hemp and marijuana are indistinguishable (which it does), and also that marijuana and crack cocaine are indistinguishable (yep), it's easy to see why the agency refused to meet with Comer. For a reminder of what Comer and other reformers are up against, here's video of DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart testifying before Congress that marijuana is every bit as dangerous as every other kind of illegal drug:
Simon writes (emphasis added):
Being a technologist, as they put it, Mr. Maciej's greater point, beyond the secrecy and lack of accountability in the FISA oversight, is that one can't apply the past to the future when one considers the formidable possibilities for human monitoring that this metadata and this level of modern computing offers. Let me stipulate to this, once and for all. I understand the capabilities of the NSA and I concede that this data can be abused and that, certainly, the risks are higher than for previous uses of such data, just as the benefits of utilizing the data are now more advanced because of digital technology's march. But again, all law enforcement capability can be abused: A 9mm on a patrolman's hip can take human life in an unjustifiable manner, a search warrant can be used to plant evidence, informants can be used to manufacture false probable cause, and interrogation rooms can be used to beat on people until they implicate themselves and others. Still, we continue to allow police to arm themselves, use informants for cause, write search warrants and talk to reluctant people in small, windowless and unsupervised rooms.
In other words, abuses of this technology pose higher risks than other technology, "but again," technology posing lower risks can also be abused. The argument doesn't lead where Simon thinks.
Says Simon:
At no point in the legal history of the United States have we ever issued a blanket prohibition against the use of a proven, scientifically-sound technology or law enforcement asset because of its imagined possibilities for misuse. There's no precedent for such. The entire construct of our legal system is predicated on allowing that which is done legally, and trying to prohibit or even punish that which is done with the same methodologies illegally.
The technology exists to put a video camera in every home and office in America; or to embed a tracking device in every person. By Simon's logic, we should all be fine with doing so, just as long as the FBI requires a warrant before it can switch on the home cameras or the tracking devices***. Why stop there? How about a lethal capsule in every American that, legally speaking, can only be activated to stop someone who has been designated a terrorist? Surely Simon can conceive of some possible technology that would be more prudently banned outright than exploited. Indeed, they go on to express deep misgivings about DNA collection of people arrested but never convicted. (He deems that threat greater than NSA spying; ergo, anyone who doesn't is contemptible.)
Simon does, at least, grant that present oversight of the NSA is insufficient:
The FISA process and its court are so completely shrouded in unaccountable secrecy that it is an unworkable apparatus for democracy. Independent review and oversight, with teeth, are the necessity here. And that oversight needs to have a healthy number of knowledgeable civilians -- duly vetted for national security -- who are professionals in the business of maintaining constitutional guarantees and civil liberties, and whose sole purpose in the process is to address those ideals. There needs to a congressional review process that can access the investigative documentation and arguments contained in affidavits for all FISA programming and investigative ventures, just as all decisions of the court need to be available to the vetted members of the intelligence committees. There needs to be periodic reporting -- a general report-card of sorts -- on the degree of civil liberties intrusions undertaken by the FISA process that is available for public review, even if such a document would be necessarily general about methodologies employed. This is the where the barricade ought to be.
This is the fight to have.
So basically, Simon castigates the people expressing deep worry about NSA surveillance for being alarmists; then argues that the program won't, in fact, be safe, pending lots of checks that don't exist and oversight that is unlikely to be implemented in the foreseeable future. Simon's series is rife with that sort of contradiction. I'll perhaps address more of them in a future post.
One of first ISPs to voluntarily introduce a three-strikes regime for punishing file-sharers has today delivered an intriguing statement. After almost four years of working mainly with the music industry, Ireland's largest ISP Eircom says it hasn't disconnected a single subscriber for Internet piracy.
According to the music and movie industries, three strikes-style regimes are needed to bring the pirating Internet masses into line. Receive three strikes/complaints (six in the United States) and then some punitive deterrent measure has to kick in.
Legislation has compelled many ISPs to participate in such programs. In 2009, South Korean ISPs became the first in the world to implement a so-called graduated response scheme and 2011's Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amendment Act brought the mechanism to New Zealand. The HADOPI legislation introduced a similar program to the French.
However, not all participation has been forced by law. The United States' “six-strikes” program was introduced voluntarily last year but by that time the Irish had already gained several years' experience of a self-imposed regime.
In 2009, Eircom, the country's largest ISP, prepared its own three-strikes program following a deal with the major recording labels, a package which allowed Eircom to disconnect persistent infringers. So now, four years since its introduction in 2010, how many people has Eircom disconnected? A hundred? One thousand? Five?
According to the ISP – not even one.
“We are continuing to implement the graduated response process,” a spokesperson said today. “We haven't, as yet, disconnected anyone.”
Eircom's system allows the user two notices of infringement before a third notice triggers a seven-day disconnection. A further notice means disconnection for a year. Considering the cries of rampant piracy from the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA), the notion that not a single subscriber from Eircom's 700,000 customer pool has been caught file-sharing more than twice is certainly going to raise eyebrows.
Several years ago the ISP said it was sending out at least 1,000 notices per week, but now the company apparently doesn't want anyone to know how many are going out.
“We don't share details on the number of letters issued,” a spokesperson said.
Independent.ie cites a source close to Eircom who states that many of those who received letters are “believed to have desisted from suspected filesharing” but with no figures being released on the number of warnings being sent, it's impossible to draw any conclusions. Of course, it's also just as easily said that those who were caught originally simply went underground with their downloading habits.
For their part, IRMA clearly thinks that the Eircom program is working. The music group is currently taking legal action to force ISP UPC to Eircom in promising to disconnect pirating customers.
If UPC loses and then follows Eircom's example, that will presumably amount to zero subscribers by 2018.
When Supergirl lands on CBS later this year, expect the show to embrace its comic book roots with visual effects as dynamic as its four-color counterpart.
That's the latest word from Supergirl's executive producer Greg Berlanti, who revealed in a recent interview that their latest comic book project (Berlanti also produces The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow) will focus heavily on visual effects and wizardry. As Berlanti put it, the show will invest a good amount into the visual effects—but it will be money wisely spent.
“When people see the pilot, they'll be blown away by what's accomplished on television,” Berlanti shared with Variety during a lengthy superhero-centric interview. To get a taste of what Berlanti is talking about, check out the series' newly-released trailer below.

Amid Amazon and Google's bitter and self-defeating feud over the right to stream videos from YouTube, Mozilla today announced that its Firefox browser is now available on Fire TV devices. The Firefox team, which just released the fastest ever version of the browser back in November, doesn't explicitly say in the blog post announcing the news that you can use Firefox to access YouTube.
But the company does write that, “Once installed, you can launch popular video websites, like YouTube, load any website address, and search the web for videos to play full screen on the Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick.” When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Mozilla confirmed that you can in fact view YouTube content using the Firefox browser on Amazon's Fire TV devices.
Firefox can access YouTube on Fire TV, just as Amazon's Silk browser might lose access
The Amazon-Google feud is mostly about Amazon's decision to pull Chromecast devices, and eventually Nest products too, from its web store more than two years ago, and Google's retaliation in the form of holding YouTube access hostage. The e-commerce giant reversed its decision on Google and Nest devices earlier this month in what appears to be an act of reconciliation, but only after Google announced it would be pulling YouTube from the Echo Show and Fire TV on January 1st.
The two companies are now in “productive talks” to resolve the situation. Yet that still means the world's largest video site may cut off access to one of the most popular set-top box product lines in as little as two weeks' time. YouTube is already inaccessible on the Echo Show because Google is blocking access to the service on Amazon's built-in Silk browser, which Amazon was using as a workaround to having a custom YouTube app for the device.
Regardless of how Google decides to respond to Firefox access, if it does in fact pull YouTube on January 1st, it's a good sign that the browser is experiencing a bit of a resurgence these days, and not just on desktop. It's great to have alternative web solutions for all internet-connected devices, especially in a world increasingly dominated by the products of three of the world's biggest corporations. And when those corporations feud, as we're seeing with Amazon and Google, it's consumers that suffer as content is blocked and products that should obviously be capable of accessing a certain app or service are left worse off than when you bought them.
That certain individuals have referred to the current presidential election drama as reminiscent of a middle school student council election does a great disservice to student council elections. But politics is about power, and knowledge is power (or so I'm told) so perhaps that's why this current crop of wannabe potentates is so obsessed with polls, surveys, and other data. And that's the last time I'll refer to the current political circus during this post. Because all politics is local, and, as a former middle-school class president myself, I have decided to focus this post on a middle-school presidential election.
This article originally appeared on MedPage Today and can be accessed here.
Full disclosure: This election does not exist. It is a figment of my imagination. Any semblance to real individuals, living or dead, is mostly coincidental.
*
The place is Boise, Idaho, and at the Pierre Perito school (a public school of some significant repute) two presidential candidates are duking it out for the votes of the Tweenagers. In one corner, Ronald Frump, a newcomer to this sort of thing who has garnered quite a following with blistering attacks on all their rivals, their promise to build a wall around the playground (to keep those rival West Boise kids out), and general swagger. Opposing them is Hilda Canton, who has been serving in the student council since Kindergarten, diligently working within the system to effect change, and only occasionally using their town-wide notoriety to land their plum speaking gigs at the local candy store.
It has been a heated race. Insults have been flung, jimmies have been rustled, and special interests (particularly the pizza-every-day lobby) have been shamelessly pandered to.
As the big day approaches, polling shows a tight race. While Ronald holds a strong lead in Ms. Jensen's 5th grade homeroom, Hilda is nearly unimpeachable among women ages 13 to 13 and a half. As usual, the election will come down to turnout. Will the recent pink eye outbreak keep 6th-graders home on Election Day?
Well, as the campaigns ramp up to full-blown blustery capacity, the big day arrives. Voting proceeds from morning til dismissal (as you can only vote during your free period), and exit polls confirm what many suspected: it's going to be close.
The votes are counted. Recounted. Recounted again. The victor? Hilda, by 241 to 220. Ah, the power of the people.
But there's a problem. Every student who voted signed in. And there are 490 signatures. Pierre Perito Middle School is missing 29 votes.
*
You can imagine the scene. Shouts of fraud, corruption, conspiracy! The Frump team disavows the entire election, stating a totally new election must be held. The Canton team, of course, states that the results are acceptable… we can't expect everything to add up perfectly. And besides, Frump would need to have 22 of those 29 votes be for them if they were going to win this election. What are the chances?! If we redo the whole election every time we miss a few votes, well, the whole system will collapse. In the end, the people have spoken. Haven't they?
Before we delve into the statistics behind this, I want to ask you to think for a second about what you would do in this situation. Do you redo the election? How would you decide? What information would help you figure it out?
Well it turns out, that missingness is not so simple an idea. In fact, there are kinds of missingness. Varieties of missingness. And missingness, and the way missingness is handled, can often tip the scales in biomedical research studies.
Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
Missing completely at random (MCAR) means that the data that is missing for purely random reasons, which is to say, no reason at all. Put more formally, the missingness is unrelated to any other covariate, measured or not. This is the type of missingness that most (but not all) statistical tests assume, the most difficult to verify, and the one, in my opinion, least relevant to biomedical research.
To take our middle school, an example of MCAR would be if someone took all the votes, shuffled them all up, and accidentally dropped 29 on the ground when transferring to the counting place. Those votes that were dropped, the missing votes, are missing completely at random. There was no choice of what vote to drop, no group got selected to be dropped on the floor.
As you can imagine, under the MCAR assumption, Frump's path to victory is an uphill climb. Let's do the math:
Looking at the votes we actually counted, 52.3% of the electorate voted for Hilda. Because the dropped votes were dropped at random, chances are about 52.3% of those would have been Hilda votes. Now, in reality, the chance nature of how votes were dropped could skew that a bit, but is it possible that it could have been skewed enough to give Frump the win? Statistics to the rescue!
Frump needs 22 of the 29 votes, around 76%. The chances of getting 76% for Frump when the underlying base probability for Frump is 47.7% is given to us by the Binomial distribution. Long story short, the chances are around 8 in 1000. Is it possible that the dropped votes swung the election? Sure. But it's not very likely.
This is, frequently, how clinical trials treat their patients who are lost to follow-up. They, essentially, assume that their outcome would be the same as whatever the outcome is in people who weren't lost to follow-up. That their missing data is, essentially, missing completely at random. I suggest to you that that assumption is not too valid.
This came to a head at an FDA panel recently where the agency was evaluating apixaban (Eliquis) a novel oral anticoagulant. The clinical trial under review had shown not only that the new drug carried with it a significantly lower rate of stroke than warfarin, but an improved overall mortality (p=0.047). But the margin for that mortality claim was quite thin – in fact, if one extra patient in the apixaban group died and one extra patient in the warfarin group survived, the difference would no longer be statistically significant. Now, ordinarily, I'd say who cares? We picked a p-value of 0.05 to be significant, we have to abide by it. But FDA reviewer Thomas Marciniak noted in their comments that data problems "destroy our confidence" that the drug reduces death. Ahh – so now we have to believe that the death rates among those missing people were exactly the same as among non-missing people. I agree, that's a stretch. (The FDA, on the other hand, didn't).
Missing completely at random is a very high bar to reach. One notch lower is MCAR's little brother, missing at random.
Missing at Random
This is… an unfortunate term. But it's how this is always described, so you should know it has a technical meaning. Missing at random differs from MCAR in that the missingness is related to a measured covariate.
Back to our election. Let's say that, because colors help children learn (citation needed), ballots were printed on pink or blue paper, and (because this is Idaho, I guess) boys get blue ballots and girls get pink. Now assume that some overzealous vice-principal trashes 29 BLUE ballots.
The ballots they chose to trash are random (at least with respect to the vote on them) but their missingness is entirely tied to color. Now what are Frump's chances.
As you can probably guess, it has something to do with how boys vote. If boys vote overwhelmingly for Frump, their chances that these discarded chits will swing the election might be substantial. For example if 75% of boys voted for Frump, the chance that these missing ballots would trun the election is 56%. With a risk that high, you might be forced to do the whole election again. Conversely, if sex has nothing to do with who you vote for, well, then we're back to the MCAR calculation and we can let the results stand.
Missing not at Random
This is the worst type of missingness. It's the kind where the missingness can not be accounted for by a variable you have on hand. This would be a situation where someone deliberately removed 29 Frump votes from the pile. This can not be proved statistically (unless you find the votes), so it can be hard to prove.
In biomedical research, this may be the most common cause of missingness. We can almost never explain completely why certain individuals were lost to follow-up (so missing at random is out). We are left, then, debating whether they dropped out due to completely random reasons (lightning strikes, alien abductions, etc), or that they dropped out for reasons that may matter. In the latter, more realistic case, there is no statistical test that can fix the results.
So we are left either closing our eyes and pretending the data is MCAR, or (and I prefer this route) doing two sensitivity analyses where you assume that everyone who you lost track of experienced the outcome or that everyone you lost track of didn't experience the outcome. If you get the same results either way, we can be pretty confident that the study conclusions are reliable.
Unfortunately, I rarely see these analyses performed. When I do, it pretty much always shows that the conclusions are robust to those sensitivity analyses. Should we be suspicious of that? I shall not judge.
So the next time you're reading that article, play this game. The authors get 1 point if they even mention missing data. They get 5 points if they try to analyze why data might be missing. They get 50 points if they do the asupervisorstioned sensitivity analyses. And if those analyses lead them to conclude that their primary results may not be valid, they get 1 million points, and the official Methods Man "You're a researcher with integrity" prize.
In the meantime, get out and vote.
Shortly after Elena Kagan was nominated to the Supreme Court in May, a front-page headline in The New York Times reported that they "Leaned Toward Conservatives" on a key issue. The issue was the First Amendment, and based on a major law review article Kagan wrote in 1996, reporter Adam Liptak predicted that in their views on freedom of expression, Kagan would be closer to conservative justice Antonin Scalia than to John Paul Stevens, the liberal justice they would replace.
Stevens, Liptak noted, had written the 1978 opinion supporting the Federal Communications Commission's ban on George Carlin's "seven dirty words." And they had dissented when the Court in 1989 struck down a Texas law making it a crime to burn the flag. Scalia was in the narrow majority that recognized the right to such inflammatory protest. The "conservative" position, in other words, favored free expression over censorship.
If this is conservatism, sign me up for Team Scalia. Fortunately, it's not quite so simple -- three of the Court's liberals joined Scalia on the correct side of the flag-burning case, for example. But the Times' inversion raises a bigger question: At a time when the right has claimed "freedom" as its central principle, do liberals take freedom, particularly civil liberties such as freedom of expression, seriously enough?
At one time, civil liberties, free expression, and the right to peaceful dissent were as central to the progressive vision as civil rights and economic fairness. But in recent years, perhaps as a result of a backlash in the 1990s against "rights-based liberalism," they seem to have receded. Sure, we're all for the rights that result in things we want for ourselves, such as the right for everyone to marry the person they love. But do we have the same commitment to the kind of rights that allow human creativity and political debate to flourish but might also lead to things we don't like, whether it's flag-burning, nasty 30-second political ads, wacky religious movements, pornography, or even hate speech? Similarly, at a moment when we want the current president to be able to overcome obstacles, do we care about limitations on presidential power that seemed so essential when the president was named Bush?
In the wake of the Supreme Court's (incorrect) decision in the recent Citizens United case, for example, it was astonishing to hear progressives cavalierly dismiss the idea that corporations might be presumed to have a right to free speech, albeit one that can be limited with certain justifications, such as to limit the influence of money in politics. Speech rights are not a privilege granted by the government only to individuals. Likewise, even progressive Democrats have been almost unanimous in backing such egregious violations of basic liberties as the 1996 Communications Decency Act (even Justice Stevens couldn't stomach that one) and the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act.
Obviously, the right wing cannot legitimately claim to be any more devoted to individual freedom, despite Tea Party rhetoric. Conservatives, too, are mostly concerned with the things they want for themselves, primarily the right to be free of taxation or economic regulation. And there is a barely hidden streak of authoritarianism in certain forms of libertarianism -- the Tea Partiers, for example, are opposed to an obscure document called the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, because they believe it would infringe their right to spank their kids.
In recent years, there has been some effort to reclaim "freedom" from the right and make it a central pillar of progressive thought. What the right calls freedom -- a society of vicious economic Darwinism, profound inequality and insecurity, and exploitation of workers -- would leave little opportunity for the vast majority to exercise much liberty at all. In the online journal The Democratic Strategist, scholar John E. Schwarz recently argued that a robust progressive conception of freedom should center on a guarantee of sufficient economic resources for everyone to fully participate in society and realize their or their own aspirations. This creative argument restores the third of Franklin Roosevelt's "Four Freedoms" -- freedom from want -- to its rightful place and thus rewrites the progressive mission of economic fairness as part of the quest for greater individual freedom.
This redefinition of freedom as economic fairness is in keeping with the evolution of the meaning of "liberalism" from John Locke's minimal state to the modern, supportive government. But it's also just a little too clever. If we want to embrace the idea of freedom, with all its political and moral power, we need to show some enthusiasm for all four of FDR's principles, not just the third, and especially their first, "freedom of speech and expression -- everywhere in the world," even when we don't much like the consequences.
Picture this: you had no access to GPS, and you wanted to set out on a long walking tour from Candler Park to see Buckhead. And you needed to give directions to your friend in Hills Park to meet you. Could you do it?
Generally, you should be able to rely on your hippocampus, the area of your brain that can make the terrain underfoot match the path in your mind. But with our reliance on tools like Google Maps, we have a shadowy area in the place of specific directions.
Well, fear not. The brain has plasticity, so it's not too late to whip your understanding of the world around you into shape. And a certain individual by the name of Archie Archambault is here to help with their concept of mind maps to get you going.
Having done 32 maps of cities all over the world, Archambault takes the archetypal simple shape of a circle to create the defining features of each urban area. Besides simplicity, circles have the practical side of conveying the overlapping nature that neighborhoods take. There are plenty of instances where you may find yourself on a street corner that two or three neighborhoods could lay claim to. It's also a metaphor for understanding a whole concept; a whole world can be found within a neighborhood.
According to BostInno, they spend a week of research to talk to people in each city without the aide of GPS, and designs the map in about 40 hours. Not to say that he's anti-tech--he just knows when they want to use it. They post their draft onto Instagram, asking for feedback from the residents there. It's a matter of self-identification, mind you--if you can recognize the meaning, then you can comment on it.
Apparently, Atlanta has approved this map, which is fairly popular with Airbnb hosts who can explain the city to newcomers. The circular structure is a friendlier metaphor to understanding the lay of the land, since the basis of our world is a globe.
Who's ready to go analog?

Indonesia says Australian Navy 'pushed' back asylum seeker boat that ran aground
Updated
Indonesian authorities say the Australian Navy forced an asylum seeker boat back towards Indonesia, where it ran out of fuel and ran aground.
Timeline December 8, 2013: A boat carrying 47 asylum seekers and two crew set sail from South Sulawesi.
December 13, 2013: Passengers say they were intercepted by the Australian Navy and "pushed" or forced back to Indonesian waters where they later ran out of fuel.
December 19, 2013: The boat was found washed up on Rote Island and those on board arrested by police.
The incident allegedly happened shortly before Christmas but has only just been reported in local Indonesian news, after refugee rights activists noticed reports and posted them on Twitter.
Indonesia's government newswire Antara says 47 mostly Somali and Sudanese asylum seekers were arrested after their boat ran aground on Rote Island, in Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara region, last month.
Local police chief Hidayat says the asylum seekers had been on a boat trying to get to the Ashmore Islands, but were intercepted by the Australian Navy and forced back to Indonesian waters.
They say the group left South Sulawesi bound for Australia on December 8.
They were then intercepted on December 13 by the Australian Navy and "pushed" or forced back to Indonesian waters.
About six days later on December 19, they were found having run out of fuel and run aground on Rote Island, where Indonesian authorities picked them up.
Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has released a statement saying the Government will not comment on the reports due to operational security operations.
"For operational security reasons, the Government does not disclose, confirm or otherwise comment on reports of on-water activities in relation to Operation Sovereign Borders," the statement said.
"Australia respects Indonesia's territorial sovereignty and will continue to do so, just as Indonesia has stated it respects Australia's territorial sovereignty.
"It is not the policy or practice of the Australian Government to violate Indonesian territorial sovereignty. Any suggestion to the contrary is false."
Labor, Greens urge Morrison to clarify incident
Labor and the Greens say the Government must reveal the details of the alleged incident.

Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young says the reports are serious and must be clarified by Mr Morrison.
"We've got a situation where a boat has been towed back by Australian officers, the boat has run aground. These people could have drowned," they said.
"How many other boats has this occurred to that we've never heard about?
"Mr Morrison must clarify immediately and it has to be today."
The Federal Government has previously outlined its intention to "turn back" boats "where it is safe to do so" as part of its asylum seeker policy.
Under Operation Sovereign Borders, Mr Morrison had been providing information about what it calls "on-water operations" during a weekly briefing given each Friday.
Mr Morrison has in the past refused to release more information about asylum seeker operations because of "national security" and "the protection of public safety".
They gave their last weekly briefing in December and it is unclear whether they will continue this year, with reports a weekly email may be distributed instead.
Reports come amid already strained relationship
News that the Australian Navy physically forced a boat of asylum seekers back to Indonesia is likely to inflame tensions between the two countries.
The issue of turning back asylum seeker boats has been a sticking point since well before the relationship became strained over the spying scandal.
Leaked notes from a meeting between Indonesia's foreign minister Marty Natalegawa and their Australian counterpart Julie Bishop, show Dr Natalegawa warned that Australia was risking trust and cooperation between the two countries.
Despite previous warnings from Indonesia in the preceding months, Ms Bishop told Dr Natalegawa that Australia would press ahead with the policy.
In late September, Tony Abbott made their first trip to Jakarta as Prime Minister and promised president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono publicly that Australia would never do anything to "violate Indonesia's sovereignty."
It was a reference to how Indonesia had termed the concept of turning boats back.
But just days beforehand, Australian authorities insisted that Indonesia's rescue agency, BASARNAS, accept the passengers from two boats rescued en route to Australia.
The move prompted Indonesia to stop rescue agencies from facilitating such transfers and instead make the issue a political one.
Mr Yudhoyono appointed the powerful coordinating minister for politics, law and security, Djoko Suyanto, to oversee Indonesia's response to asylum seekers.
Djoko Suyanto, a close ally of the president, later made it clear when Australia attempted to return another boatload of asylum seekers, that it would not accept returns.
In early November, as Australia attempted to return a boatload of asylum seekers to Java, Djoko Suyanto told ABC News that Indonesia's position would not change.
After nearly two days the Australian Government gave in and sent the asylum seekers to Christmas Island.

Or you can just remove them from the .conf after you load it, as the valid ones will now be in peers.dat
maybe that is what they intended to do... only connect to exclusive peer (that they believe on the main/correct chain)
I actually tried removing .conf after that and started the client again, and it still re-connects to certain clients on wrong fork again
I think because it always asks for more new peers from the connected peers to propagate the network
How can I tell? because when I removed .conf my upload bandwidth went crazy again...
all connected peers are all different than this exclusive list I connected earlier
and I noticed 1 of the connected peer height is way below (is at 173217) and stay like that for days as I remember
also a few connected nodes are at "startingheight" : -1 I doubt that means they just started.
What exactly height -1 means here?
in .conf file, is there a way to block certain peer? something like perma-banned until we removed it in the future

Its indeed intended to force your wallet to connect only to certain/trusted peers.
When using connect= , Listen=1 will be ignored, which means no incomming connects accepted.
What clam needs would be so-called seed peers or nodes.
1 is enough, but for back up reasons of course its better to have at least 2 or more.
How to block certain peers ?
You can make use of an ip filter like peerblock.
There are others out there.
Also LMHOST file inside your windows directory can be used to do that, effectively redirecting unwanted ip to blackhole, and have a nice day !
But any decent firewall, indeed NOT Windows firewall, can be used to block.
Depending on what apps I have running I use firewall and at times make use of peerblock on top of it.
Peerblock comes with block lists so you can block ip ranges of anti p2p, secret service or other crap.
Also have a look at TCPView, it shows you what is connected to your box.
It has helped me findig unwanted connects of various app including Windows.
NETstat will do the same btw.
As usual, a quick search on the net should get you further information.
Do a search of bitcoin.conf to locate the wiki, detailed info about options and how to use them.
Further questions ?
Just post and I will try to help if time permits it.

Unrestrained by demands for source accuracy, original anime provide audiences with a fresh story to learn and new characters to love. Without a manga/manhwa, light novel, visual novel, video game, or even music video to establish it, such works allow animation studios to fully exercise their staff's creativity while partaking in a huge gamble. Although originals are outnumbered by adaptations, chances are you've heard of well-loved series such as Angel Beats! by PA Works, Cowboy Bebop by Sunrise, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica by Shaft. And these are just a few!
Sometimes we wonder: "Wouldn't it be great to be able to make anime?" Afterall, it is just drawing, right? On the contrary—a little bit of research easily illustrates how difficult and tedious it is to create smooth, hand-drawn animation. Deeper research shows that, remarkably, there aren't a lot of English-translated articles or documentaries showcasing the hard work of animators. In the context of original works, this article will go over many of the steps taken in creating our beloved medium!
Story
The writer(s) for original anime have to directly pitch their stories to willing studios. Sources adapted into anime are traditionally chosen by producers due to the source's already proven popularity. With an original, no one knows just how the world will react until that first episode airs. However, having your original story chosen for animation is proof enough that an entire studio believes in your work—that's pretty confidence-boosting!
Character Design
Character design sheet for Cowboy Bebop
An incredible amount of thought and editing (and re-editing) goes into polishing characters who have both recognisable appearances and dynamic personalities. Adaptations get to skip this step entirely. Everything from art style to colour palette—from clothes to motivations: studios must finalise these decisions before any animation work can begin. Characters, after all, make or break every story.
Storyboard
Each scene, each movement of the "camera," and every action animated is outlined by the director in their storyboard. These often undetailed drawings and scribbled notes are how directors communicate their vision and are the basis by which the rest of the team operates. Storyboards are gone over several times—usually by several eyes—before being passed down to the animators. Notable industry names, like KyoAni's Naoko Yamada, first showcase their directorial style upon being chosen as an "episode director," a temporary director who works on only a few episodes of a show.
Keyframes & Inbetweens
Frames used in the making of Kill la Kill
As their name implies, keyframes are the most important frames in an animation and firmly illustrate every change in action. "Keyframers" are capable of accurately portraying the director's storyboards and the team's character designs while showing their own ability to control and understand the flow of the scene. "In-betweening." drawing every frame in-between every keyframe, is typically outsourced or given to freelancers. Every frame is checked thoroughly and redrawn as necessary—inbetweens by keyframers (yellow paper) and keyframes by directors or heads of animation (pink paper). A standard 23 minute, 24 frames per second episode—excluding the opening and ending—can contain over 33,120 frames!
Colouring
Once approved, all of the hand-drawn frames are sent to the colouring department. Given a detailed colour sheet by the character design team, the colourers are tasked with scanning the frames into digital images and filling in the drawings. All 33,120 of them! Mistakes in colours are often due to miscommunication. To save time, the animation team sends the colouring department scenes as they are finished—and not necessarily in chronological order! This is one of the reasons why anime tend to avoid frequent costume changes.
Set Design & Backgrounds
The appearance of a school. The structure of a city. The forests, the ocean, the clouds. Architecture and the surrounding environments provide an amazing amount of information about the world to the audience! Set designers work more closely with the buildings and cities of an anime, while a typically outsourced art team will work on backgrounds and establishing shots. However, many of the general decisions about setting, such as atmosphere, inspiration, weather, and scale, are made jointly by the director and the original work's creator before any art is made.
Layouts
Like keyframes, layouts manifest the director's vision into more detailed and cinematic representations. Unlike keyframes, these drawings don't appear in the final product. This is because they are only sketches that represent the approximate placement of objects, scenery, and characters shown in the "camera" frame. Compositional tactics from film cinematography—rule of thirds, golden ratio, lead room, dynamic lines—are fully employed in these reference drawings, enabling the animation and background teams to create cohesive and visually-pleasing scenes despite working separately.
CG
CG, in anime, generally refers to any 3D-rendered element. Studios often choose to use 3D CG when there's a scene too complex to hand-draw, such as moving stairs, weaponised vehicles, or complicated structures. This work is always outsourced to a specialised studio where they use 3D modeling/animation programs such as 3DSMax or Maya. Unfortunately, some lag or artifacting is introduced during rendering, a process that requires the devotion of a computer's entire CPU for several hours. In general, the less powerful the CPU, the more the 3D suffers.
Music & Sound Design
When work on an anime's OST begins depends on the ambitions of the studio. The director and producer decide how much freedom they want to give their composers and concertmasters. Some tell these musicians vague emotions or a simple scene description; others give the finished animations as inspiration. SFX are mixed by sound designers who recreate ambient noise into exaggerated, more epic, and louder versions of their realities—from the rustle of leaves to the clashing of swords to the cicadas that haunt all anime summers.
Voice Acting
It's quite obvious what seiyuu do. Like the OST, the time the voice acting is recorded varies. Anime that begin recording early typically intend to use the emotions and facial expressions as a basis for the animation. Anime that start recording during production have the seiyuu time and empathise themselves with the provided video of the storyboard or keyframes. Sitting inside the sound booth behind the glass, the scriptwriter, director, and sound director follow along and listen for anything that may cause misinterpretation.
Cinematography & Editing
When viewers talk about "cinematography" in anime, they are mostly comparing it to its use in live-action films and shows with actual cameras. This is easily understood when said in reviews, but what the animation industry means by "cinematography" is completely different! To anime studios, it means bringing all of the separately-created characters, backgrounds, sounds, and light effects together to complete the scene. Everything is synchronised. Editing is also slightly different from live-action; the anime's director personally goes over every completed scene, changing the playback speeds of certain elements and removing frames as needed.
"Rushes" Check
Even after the innumerable edits done during production, each episode must go through another series of incredibly thorough checks. The industry calls these gatherings of directors and other important staff "rushes" because they occur a week or two before each episode airs. Changes can be made anywhere and can be for anything! The rest of the studio must also "rush" to make these edits so that the main staff's "rushes" are up-to-date and checked again. "Rushes" can take anywhere from several hours to several days, with delays in production ultimately hampering how thorough these checks can be.
Finally, Episode 1 airs and an original anime is brought to the audience as shiny and spectacular as its studio can manage. All of the work seems to have lead to that first showing, but production continues as the weeks between episodes go by. From nothing more than an idea (from scratch!), a beautiful and meaningful animation can arise, its topics, art style, and themes unlike anything the already vast world of anime has seen before. Original works showcase the creativity of curators and the drive of studios to take on hundreds of work-hours to sail far into unknown, untested waters. And we, as viewers, get the gift of seeing something for the first time: no expectations, no spoilers, and a whole new story to dive into.
It's not impossible to set aside seven weeks a year for it; the global game would benefit
The IPL effectively has carved out its own window, so why not make it official? © Associated Press
Whether you love it or hate it, whether you follow it avidly or believe it debases a great and noble game, it is time to accept the inevitable when it comes to the IPL. It is here to stay. It is more powerful with every passing year. For the sake of sanity, and the reputation of Test cricket, it must be given a window in the ICC's cricket calendar.
As Sharda Ugra commented on these pages, IPL 5 was immensely popular not just with the players it rewards so handsomely, it drew in big crowds across a wide demographic. Its excesses were hard to take at times, but the fervour it communicates can only be a good thing for the game. And it will eventually devour all those who refuse to accept it.
The IPL and Test cricket must learn to live together, if not happily then at least behind a mental leylandii. The ICC's cricket committee, which is meeting over two days at Lord's, has the chance to begin that process by calling for an end to the posturing, the belittling and the power struggles that are doing a disservice to the game.
The committee, under the chairpersonship of the former West Indies captain Clive Lloyd, has been asked to consider "the proliferation of domestic leagues (including foreign players and, in some cases private ownership) and the consequent impact on international cricket".
That does not refer only to IPL because T20 leagues are springing up throughout the world - apart from the one in England, which is now a hardy perennial and which reseeds itself with humble success every summer. But it is the IPL that matters.
One of the functions of the ICC is "to promote, develop and act in the best interests of the international game as a whole". That task cannot properly be fulfilled while Test cricket is made a mockery of by trying to behave as if the IPL does not exist. Under the current situation, top players must make an unfair choice between financial gain and national loyalty and the public is being short-changed.
Lloyd, who has watched the decline of West Indies cricket since the halcyon days when they captained a side blessed with the greatest fast-bowling resources the world has ever seen, must be keenly aware that something has to give. Kumar Sangakkara, one of the shrewdest minds ever produced by Sri Lankan cricket, and another member of the committee, has been a long-time supporter of an IPL window as the only logical outcome.
West Indies are contesting a May Test series against England this year without the likes of Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo and the young mystery spinner Sunil Narine*. Predictably, for all their determination, they have lost the first two Tests, the warm-up act before England's main show of the summer against South Africa.
The faultlines in West Indies cricket, of course, cannot all be laid at the door of IPL. But how much more appealing would the series have been if West Indies had their full complement, and if Narine had arrived in England in direct competition to their fellow spinner Shane Shillingford as an exciting young talent? How unfair was it for Marlon Samuels, one West Indies player who did remain loyal to Test cricket, to suffer financially because of it? And how sad it is that Gayle, emboldened by riches from the IPL and other T20 tournaments, now behaves with all the calculating menace of a hired gun.
West Indies cannot afford to pay their players remotely the sort of money needed to persuade them to forego the IPL, but that should not be their aim anyway. It is far more beneficial to international cricket for talented young cricketers in the Caribbean to recognise a future in which they can conceivably enjoy the adulation of India's T20 crowds and commit themselves to the history of West Indies cricket. It is unfair to expect them to make a choice.
Even for England, which has held the line with reasonable success, the fault lines are showing. Eoin Morgan, not picked for England's Test tour of Sri Lanka, responded to their omission from the squad by remaining as a bench player for Kolkata Knight Riders until the end of the qualifying tournament - they never played but still came back proclaiming themselves a better player for the experience. Their lack of interest in fighting for their Test place has strangely passed without much explanation.
The IPL is a successful business model run by companies who know something about business. That is a fact and it is not about to change
Kevin Pietersen did return in time for England's first Test against West Indies but if their Twitter account was a true reflection, their thoughts were often elsewhere. Playing for Surrey in a championship match at Worcester ahead of the first Test, they got out as Surrey successfully fought to save the game, and tweeted not about the sterling efforts of their county colleagues in the match they were playing in, but excitedly about Delhi Daredevils' next match. Get used to it, is Pietersen's response.
IPL franchises might only be able to field four overseas players but they can sign up to 11, which this year left the possibility of 99 international players from outside India signed up for the tournament and countless more desperate for an opportunity.
Sri Lanka were England's opponents last May and Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene arrived in England with minimal time to acclimatise ahead of the first Test, their exact travel date the subject of endless conjecture as Sri Lanka Cricket subsided into one of its regular political struggles. The spat led to Lasith Malinga's retirement from Test cricket. Others will follow.
Other countries may carp that if IPL gets a window, they deserve one, too. It would be an argument that flew in the face of reality. There are overriding reasons why the IPL deserves a window ahead of other domestic T20 tournaments.
India is the financial powerhouse of the game, responsible for about 75% of world cricket revenue. The IPL is a successful business model run by companies who know something about business. The IPL has a hold over the world's leading cricketers like no other league. The IPL can win over a new cricket-watching public more successfully than any other domestic league. The IPL, allowed to run free, will inexorably damage the traditional forms of the game. These are facts and irrespective of national sentiments they need to be addressed.
Those who are not selected for the IPL can either spend two months recuperating from a heavy international schedule or could even play a spot of English county cricket.
What is frustrating about the current situation is that an IPL window would not be difficult to achieve. It consisted of 76 matches in 53 days, running from April 4 to May 27. Reduce that to 49 days and begin on April 1 and it can finish on May 20. There seems to be no other time of the year.
It would prevent West Indies and Sri Lanka extending their international seasons into early April, but that is preferable to seeing their playing standards crippled. It would necessitate England putting its first Test of the summer back to the last week of May, an affordable price to pay for a country that by fielding up to seven Tests and 13 one-day matches a year is already guilty of overkill. As quid quo pro, India could end its block on all its players taking part in other T20 leagues, England's especially, which would enable it to balance the books.
People often wonder why India, so powerful, has not lobbied hard for a window for IPL, The answer is simple: India does not need a window; India is winning the power struggle anyway. It is the rest of the world that needs to negotiate a sensible future.

The March 2016 meeting was followed by a breakfast the next month at a London hotel during which Mr. Mifsud revealed to Mr. Papadopoulos that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of “thousands of emails.” That was months before the theft of a trove of emails from the Democratic National Committee by Russian-sponsored hackers became public.
Mr. Mueller's investigators are seeking to determine who — if anyone — in the Trump campaign Mr. Papadopoulos told about the stolen emails. Although there is no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos emailed that information to the campaign, Mr. Papadopoulos was in regular contact that spring with top campaign officials, including Stephen Miller, now a senior adviser to President Trump, according to interviews and campaign documents reviewed by The New York Times.
The revelations about Mr. Papadopoulos's activities are part of a series of disclosures in the past two weeks about communications between Trump campaign advisers and Russian officials or self-described intermediaries for the Russian government. Taken together, they show not only that the contacts were more extensive than previously known, but also that senior campaign officials were aware of them.
Last week, Carter Page, another former foreign policy adviser to the campaign, acknowledged to the House Intelligence Committee that they also had a private conversation with a Russian deputy prime minister on a trip to Moscow in July 2016. Mr. Page, who had previously denied meeting any Russian officials during the trip, said that they had informed at least four campaign officials about their trip beforehand and notified the campaign afterward that the Russian minister had pledged “strong support for Mr. Trump.”
Publicly, Mr. Trump and former campaign officials have tried to distance themselves from Mr. Papadopoulos. Although they once praised them as an “excellent guy,” Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that “few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokesperson, said their involvement in the campaign was “extremely limited.”
SPAZ 2 Development in pictures!
When we started development for SPAZ 2, we decided we wanted to develop two versions of the game. One was functional, but looked like grey cubes firing red spheres at each other. The other was a graphics version, where all the assets and environment construction took place. We took this segregated approach because we didn't want to develop all the visual technology alongside the base gameplay functionality and have them constantly collide with one another. It took several months before we folded the two projects into one. In this album we'll gradually show some early visual tests, the fusion of the two projects, and the development of the game up to now.After one month we had a basic procedural assembly of environments. The planets are randomly generated, with animated cloud and ocean layers. It worked, but looked very waxy at this early stage. It took some time to get used to programming shaders. The environment and star colors are also randomized, informing all the light and fog layers accordingly.3 Months in. Lots of post effects and shaders progress. We finished a basic set of generic ship parts, however, these are baked out of Maya. The functional ships were still grey block at this point. I also couldn't help but put myself in the game as the little dudes that get sucked out of hull breaches.After 6 months, we finally fussed the art and functional builds together into a single project. No more grey block! Multiplayer and ship AI were coming together, allowing us to stress test the complexity of our new ships.Lots of early visualization tests here. We tried opening the floodgates on auto assembled ships as a test. It's hard to tell how many ship parts we're looking at here, but it's obscene. The game runs at about 1 frame a second with a ship like this, but we're happy the system didn't crash. You'll never see a ship like this in-game, but its good the system can handle just about anything we can throw at it.
Story highlights Vietnam's first McDonald's restaurant opened this weekend
More than 70 years after it was founded, McDonald's operates in more than 100 countries
But not all of its branches are without controversy: Take a look at some of them
As McDonald's opens its first restaurant in Vietnam , take a look at some of the big breakthroughs the fast food chain has made in the past -- from its first outlet in the Soviet Union, through the Kosher Mac and MacMaharaja, to the branch at Guantanamo Bay.
Russia
It took McDonald's 14 years of intense negotiations to convince the Communist leaders of the Soviet Union to allow the chain to set up their first restaurant. Yet almost as soon as the Iron Curtain began to fall, the first McDonald's opened in Moscow's busy Pushkin Square -- on January 31, 1990.
The restaurant seated 700 diners and its opening attracted thousands of people, who queued for hours to spend the equivalent of weeks' salaries on a single burger.
The company says the Moscow branch is still the largest McDonald's in the world.
Israel
McDonald's operates around 180 branches in Israel, of which over 50 are kosher, meaning they only serve food that meets strict dietary requirements.

Unlike the non-kosher restaurants, these branches stay closed on Saturdays to observe the Shabbat and boast a unique logo with the golden arches sitting on a blue, rather than red background.
McDonald's restaurants around the world cater to local demands by including their own versions of regional specialties on the menu: in Israel, that's the "MacKebab."
Guantanamo Bay U.S. Navy base
The McDonald's within the compound at Guantanamo Bay naval base is the only branch of the fast food chain on the island of Cuba. The restaurant is only accessible to the base's personnel and the chain says it has no plans to open any other branches in Cuba.
Bosnia and Herzegovina
McDonald's spent more than four years trying to break into the Bosnian market, but opposition from local shop owners, supported by the government, was fierce. The chain finally opened its first branch in the country in 2011.
McDonald's Arabia
McDonald's has managed to succeed in many Middle Eastern countries, offering various culturally- and religiously appropriate specialties to its Muslim customers.
The company's first venture into the Arab world was Morocco, where it opened its first branch in Casablanca in 1992.
Most branches respect Ramadan, restricting service in fasting periods during the holy month, and offering special menus at night.
Certified halal-quality food is widely available, and the restaurant tries to reflect the local tastes by offering the MacArabia Chicken Sandwich, served in folded Arabic bread.
In Saudi Arabia, the chain adheres to local laws by segregating male and female diners -- much to the disapproval of international women's rights organizations
India
The global hamburger chain is a big success in India, where it operates 300 branches.
McDonald's offers special meals to please the palates of local customers; it does not serve any beef or pork-based burgers, reflecting the religious beliefs of many Indians. Instead, it offers the Chicken MacMaharaja and the McAloo Tikki -- a vegetarian-friendly blend of spicy potatoes and peas.
Iraq
OK, it's not really the real deal, but McDonald's could still claim it as a win -- of sorts... As on other U.S. military bases around the world, McDonald's food used to be available within Baghdad's Green Zone.
And while the chain is not planning to expand into the country, a successful knock-off fast food restaurant "MaDonald's" in the town of Sulaypersoniyah has been popular with locals since it opened there in the 1990s.
The Circle is the first home camera for Logitech, but it's also building on its experience with webcams and outdoor security cameras. (This is also the second product in the consumer-friendly Logi line, after its recent iPad cases.) While the Circle isn't as sleek as Nest's new camera, it has a bulbous design that's sort of cute (it reminds me of the new Star Wars BB-8 Droid). And even though its case and charging bay (which the camera latches onto magnetically) are made of plastic, they still feel pretty sturdy.
On the software side, Logitech came up with a few unique features to make the Circle stand out. You can have the camera create a "Day Brief," which algorithmically produces a sped up video of the day's highlights. Logitech also filters all of the video and surfaces the most interesting segments when browsing the Circle's iOS or Android app.
After testing out the Circle for a few days, I was surprised by how polished the entire experience was. My phone recognized the camera within seconds of launching the Circle app, and it then prompted me to connect the camera to a WiFi network. After that, I quickly registered for Logitech's Circle service and the camera was ready to go. It records 720p video at this point -- the camera is capable of shooting 1080p, but 720p is easier to broadcast on most WiFi networks.
The footage overall looked fairly clear, with a decent amount of sharpness and no major artifacts. There also weren't any hiccups when I yanked the Circle out of its charging pod and walked around with it. As long as I was within range of my WiFi network, everything worked fine. Like most security cameras, the Circle uses a very wide angle lens, so there's a pretty big distortion curve with all of your footage. And yes, it also has night vision and motion detection capabilities.
I was particularly impressed with the Day Brief feature. It's completely on-demand, and it never took more than a few seconds for Logitech's servers to generate a quick recap of the day's events. It's not any way to view your baby's first steps, but it provides a helpful glance of what's going on in your home (or wherever you point it).

Just over a week ago, a terrorist who came to the United States through the Diversity Visa Lottery program launched an attack in which they plowed a truck through cyclists on a New York City bike path, killing eight people and injuring 11 others.
Afterwards, the left was quick to defend the Diversity Visa Lottery program, arguing that this program was intended to help immigrants from all walks of life, even Ireland.
But while this was true thirty years ago, it certainly isn't true anymore...
On Tuesday's Off the Cuff, John Cardillo explained that the program began 1986 in response to the Immigration Act of 1965, which eliminated country quotas for Western Europe, decreasing immigration opportunities for people from countries like Ireland.
Twenty years later, a group of Irish-American members of congress tried to fix this by introducing the Diversity Lottery Program as a temporary measure that would provide alternative paths to a "Green Card" for citizens from countries that were adversely affected by the Immigration Act.
Thirty years later, despite what the leftwing claims, this program is actually rarely used as a means for people from Ireland enter the U.S.
In 2016, only 36 people came to the U.S. from Ireland through the Diversity Visa Lottery program.
In contrast, a staggering 2,778 people from the Democratic Republic of the Congo came here through this program in 2016. Keep in mind that in that country, rape is rampant and 74 per cent of its inhabitants support Shariah law.
In addition, 2,855 people from Egypt came to the U.S. through this program from 2016. Egypt is another country in which 74 per cent of citizens supports Shariah law. These statistics just go to show exactly what kind of people are coming to the U.S. through this loophole of a program.
This proves that the argument that the Diversity Visa Lottery program is being used to help white Europeans from Ireland is a complete myth.
The Warriors have withdrawn their $1,147,276 qualifying offer to Ognjen Kuzmic, Eric Pincus of Basketball Insiders reports (Twitter link). He's now become an unrestricted free agent, as Golden State has forfeited its right to match offers for him. The Warriors were facing a deadline, as Thursday is the final day that a team may withdraw a qualifying offer to a player without their consent.
The two sides can still strike a deal, but the Warriors can no longer prevent Kuzmic from joining another NBA squad. There hasn't been much chatter regarding any NBA teams being interested in the seven-footer's services, though now that the ability for Golden State to match any offers is gone, the market could pick up for Kuzmic. The Mavs are still in need of frontcourt depth, and could give the big man a look, though that is merely my speculation.
Kuzmic appeared in just 16 games for the Warriors last season, averaging 1.3 points and 1.1 rebounds in 4.5 minutes per contest. The 25-year-old spent the bulk of last season in the D-League playing for Golden State's affiliate. Kuzmic played in 29 contests for Santa Cruz, logging 12.8 PPG, 12.0 RPG, and 2.0 BPG with a slash line of .493/.000/.772.
The Wisconsin branch of the National Rifle Association sure did make a mess of things this past weekend. Not only was their lobbyist caught on tape bragging about how they control the legislature, but the NRA was handing out copies of The Reality News, an extremist right-wing publication. But not only is it an extremist right-wing publication, it's an extremist right-wing publication calling for armed revolt to topple the government.
Within the publication was a piece by Karl Koenigs titled, “What Would Davy Crockett Say?” In the article, they make a call for armed revolt, to topple the democratically elected government of the United States, following with the imposition of a dictatorship, where he, and those who believe as they do, are the dictators.
A direct quote from the article:
ELECTIONS ARE NOT THE SOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEM; ELECTIONS ARE THE PROBLEM!
Further in, to resolve the issues they see with the system, their proposal offers this:
This is a most heinous disease that can only be cured by the constitutional De-Centralized power of our home country of Wisconsin restoring our “supreme Laws” on our Federal public servants within our borders; OR otherwise by a combo Civil/Re-Revolutionary War with the very same goal to restore the rule of OUR Laws on our elected non-elected and wannabe elected Republican and Democrat Federal servants through the refreshment of the Tree of Liberty by its natural manure. (sic)
You can read the article for yourself, but the site requires you sign in first. If you're interested, click here:
Basic research turns up that Mr. Koenigs is a member of the Constitutional Sheriffs, and part of the Oath Keepers, a group labelled as domestic terrorists.
Further research pulled up more of Mr. Koenigs' thoughts, including a nicely framed write-up on how to solve the problems in the United States. Read it for yourself (sic on all below):
What YOU and a bunch of Patriots like you need to do is form a coalition to: Form a base “Committee on State Sovereignty” (which is, at this point anyway and likely hopefully never, for secession). Create a framework of communication “nodes” and a communications HQ which will be the Chairperson of the Committee. There shall be a “node” in each State Senate and Assembly voting district in the State. Each “node” leader shall procure 20 – 25+ callers who stand at ready to make calls to their State Senator and Assemblyman upon a signal from HQ to make very well timed and coordinated requests to sponsor and pass initiatives starting with the State Sovereignty Resolution. Produce a very constitutionally crafted State Sovereignty Resolution with Arrest Provision. The Arrest Provision makes it “binding”, in every sense of the term and more than just “feel good” words that are more shallow than a politicians promise. I would highly recommend using the Alternate State Sovereignty Resolution we are, altered for your state, because it is as Constitutional as you can get, no court can rationally argue against it, as it has largely been drafted by the authors of The Declaration of Independence and The Constitution, Messrs. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and has been specifically drafted for NULLIFICATION of any unlawful Act of Congress or the Executive branch which usurps powers, size, scope or spending that exceeds the eighteen enumerated powers under Article I Section 8 of The Constitution in accord with the 9th and 10th Amendments. This version of State Sovereignty will specifically facilitate the defense to any Federal court challenge of any properly nullified Federal usurpation made by the State, specifically BECAUSE of the wording and the language. If anybody asks me I will forward a copy of ours to you. The State Sovereignty Resolution shall have a provision for a delegation of Senate and Assemblymen to travel to assemble with all the other States; From the coalition muster a delegation of 2 – 4 persons who will be able to lobby, mostly together as is best, the State Senators and Assemblymen and provide valuable feedback from the happenings at the Capitol. The State Sovereignty Resolution shall have a provision for a delegation of Senate and Assemblymen to travel to assemble with all the other States; After the Sovereignty Resolution has been sponsored and passed by at least one house, both would be better, then start working procuring sponsorship and support for the following companion legislative measures in support of and preparation for NULLIFICATION: http://youtu.be/bLjQzlMDX2I All County Sheriff Departments shall be provided a course on The Constitution by The National Center for Constitutional Studies (NCCS) or by Michael Badnarik to ensure that they have a comprehensive understanding of what they have sworn an Oath to protect and defend against all enemies both foreign and domestic.. All State and Local Law Enforcement shall be provided and shall attend a Constitutional course by The National Center for Constitutional Studies or Michael Badnarik to ensure that they have a comprehensive understanding of what they have sworn an Oath to protect and defend against all enemies both foreign and domestic.. All State National Guard members shall attend a Constitutional course by NCCS or Michael Badnarik to ensure that they have a comprehensive understanding of what they have sworn an Oath to protect and defend against all enemies both foreign and domestic. All County Sheriffs and their deputies shall join www.CountySheriffProject.org and www.Oathkeepers.org. Cost for dues shall come out of their own pockets, so that they are personally invested in the program and have financial incentive to know and be involved with these programs. All State and local Law Enforcement shall join www.Oathkeepers.org. Cost for dues shall come out of their own pockets, so that they are personally invested in the program and have financial incentive to know and be involved with these programs. All County Sheriffs Departments shall offer, facilitate and train Constitutional Militia in each corner and center of their county for a minimum of five units. All Militia members shall give the Oath to protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies both foreign and domestic. All Constitutional Militia members shall attend a Constitution course by NCCS or Michael Badnarik paid for by their respective county government. Cities and towns shall contribute to facilitate and provide equipment and gear for their local Constitutional Militia volunteers. After all of the above State legislative measures been enacted and engaged, then the State shall start nullifying all unlawful Acts of Congress AND the Executive branch and all associated usurpation, tyranny, coercion, mandates and Income and other taxation dating back to at least 1913 including all Acts that exceed the eighteen enumerated powers clauses under Article I Section 8 of The Constitution, pursuant to the 9th and 10th Amendments. Result: Balance of the Union follows the same process, U.S. Government dissolved by 2/3rds which exceeds the eighteen enumerated powers, size, scope and spending WE THE PEOPLE granted them to “secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity” (Source: Preamble of The Constitution). STATE SOVEREIGNTY + NULLIFICATION = N.B.C.R. ! These measures are specifically designed to PREVENT an otherwise imminent combo Civil/Re-Revolutionary War to accomplish the exact same thing WE THE PEOPLE can do by peaceful resolve; RESTORE the RULE of Our Constitutional Laws on our elected, non-elected and wannabe elected Republican and Democrat Federal public servants, especially but not limited to the EIGHTEEN enumerated powers in accord with the 9th and 10th Amendments in The Bill of Rights. And to PREVENT WAR and Martial Law, following the collapse of the U.S. Dollar by PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.
Mr. Koenigs is no constitutional scholar. I highly suspect their research came from the echo chamber of noted stochastic terrorist media outlet, Fox News. And this is the material which the National Rifle Association elected to have passed out at its state meeting in Wisconsin the past weekend.
Ultimately, this is not about Mr. Koenigs' faulty viewpoint of what the United States Constitution does or does not say. It is about a lobbying group, which claims to have 4 million members, handing out material calling for direct civil war, to overthrow the government by means of force, at a state meeting in Wisconsin.
The National Rifle Association has not yet replied to Addicting Info‘s request of statement on the handing out of the anti-government material.

"Take the [Germans] out of the Union Army and we could whip the Yankees easily," Robert E. Lee allegedly remarked. The quote, likely apocryphal, captures an important fact. Immigrants born in Germanic lands were enormously overrepresented in the Union Army. By one estimate, 176,817 donned the army blue, half again as many as their share of the overall population would have predicted. Other reliable estimates range as high as 216,000. And adding in the descendants of earlier generations of German immigrants would more than triple that total. The Germans, one contemporary judged, understood "from the beginning, the aim and the end of the civil war, [and] they have embraced the cause of the Union and emancipation with an ardor and a passion."
If the German reenactors actually "model their characters in the reenactments after...German immigrant soldiers," as they explained to the reporter that they do, then those who wear gray have their work cut out for them. Less than 10 percent of the Germans immigrants in the United States, scarcely 70,000, dwelt in the entire territory controlled by the Confederacy at the outbreak of the war. Many fled north, with perhaps 2,000 joining the Union Army. Hundreds of those who remained petitioned the consuls of German states for protection from the draft. There were certainly some ardent secessionists, and even a few slaveholders, and between 3,500 and 7,000 Germans may have served in the Confederate Army. But of that number, many were conscripted, a large number deserted, and some mutinied. "The German minority of the South," one scholar concluded, "was all but insignificant politically, economically, and militarily during the American Civil War."
So why are Germans dressing in Confederate Gray?
The PRI story explains that "A lot of fantasies have built up around the Confederacy; thanks to the movie Gone with the Wind, it is a staple of German popular culture." Margaret Mitchell's novel was published in Germany in 1937; over the next four years it sold 276,900 copies there, becoming the most popular American product of the era. Reviewers hoped it would salvage the reputation of the institution of slavery, redeeming it from the calumnies of Uncle Tom's Cabin, and praised its portrayal of a "wonderful, strictly regulated life," with "patriarchal, well-defined relations between black and white."
The film reached Nazi Germany in 1940. "A great American achievement," Goebbels raved, "One must see it more than once." It was reportedly one of Hitler's two favorite films. A home video shows them teasing a supporter, "I know you would rather be watching Gone with the Wind."
In itself, this reveals rather less than it may seem: Gone with the Wind may have "glamorized the Old South and romanticized the Confederacy," as historian James McPherson contends, but it is also among the most popular novels and films ever released. If German reenactors ground their affection in that imagined past, they are hardly alone.
Atlus To Stream Over 30 Hours Of Persona Content And News Starting Feb 4
By Sato . January 24, 2015 . 8:45am
February 5 marks the day of the “Persona Super Live 2015” concert, where we can expect to hear the latest news for Persona 5. Atlus just announced that they'll be streaming a massive 30+ hours of Persona-related… stuff… prior to the event.
Persona 4: Golden PS Vita the Best, a “Greatest Hits” version in Japan, will also be released on the date of the concert. To commemorate the occasion of the concert event and release of the game, Atlus are holding a stream that will last over 30 hours.
According to the website, the “Flash! Persona Channel 2015” livestream will be available for viewing on Nico Nico Douga, and it will also continue on during the concert which takes place on the following day. The purpose of the stream is to show off the charm of the Persona series and also introduce what it's about to those who aren't familiar with the series.
The website also notes that it will be loaded with the latest Persona news. The stream will carry on over 30 hours and it starts at 1pm Japan time on February 4th.
You'll be able to check the stream out on the official website and it will also be streamed via NicoNico. 30 hours of livestreaming sounds extremely chaotic—and most of it will likely be filler content—but Siliconera will attempt to cover the major announcements that take place.
THE jail sentences dealt by a Saudi judge to two of the kingdom's most prominent rights activists on March 9th came as little surprise. The two men, Abdullah al Hamid and Muhammad al Qahtani, were well aware that their outspoken criticism of the Saudi authorities and championing of the rights of political prisoners would sooner or later provoke a backlash.
Three other members of the group that they co-founded in 2009, the Association for Civil and Political Rights (known as ACPRA), are already serving prison sentences. Mr Hamid, 62, has themselves been jailed more than once for demanding that the country should evolve into a constitutional monarchy. Mr Qahtani, 46, teaches economics at Riyadh's prestigious Diplomatic Institute, and has been a pugnacious defender of civil liberties for more than a decade. Like other Saudi would-be-reformers they have both long been subjected to travel bans and other forms of petty persecution.
Yet the case has held some surprises. For one thing, their seven-month-long trial has been held in public, and closely followed by thousands of Saudis via Twitter. As a result, the court's proceedings have roused unprecedented controversy. Few Saudis had been aware, for example, that to argue publicly that elected representatives, rather than religious scholars, should be entrusted with applying laws, as the two men did, could be considered a criminal offence. Mingling with foreigners and supplying them with "false information" were suspicious activities, too, according to the judge.
It was also striking that in their final ruling, the judge likened ACPRA to Al Qaeda. Like Osama Bin Laden's terrorist gang, they said, the rights group actively advocated disobedience to the kingdom's rightful ruler, and cast doubt on the integrity of its highest religious authorities. The only difference between the two groups, argued the judge, was that Al Qaeda preached violence and ACPRA did not.
In the end, the judge convicted the two men on 12 counts. The sentences—10 years for Mr Qahtani, and 11 for Mr Hamid (which include six from a previous conviction that had been waived via a royal pardon, now revoked), plus travel bans following their release, were unusually harsh for such a high-profile case. Both men have appealed. Their lawyer has mounted a separate protest at the court's decision to hold them in custody before the appeal is heard.
Yet despite the deepened gloom in the kingdom's small, hard-pressed community of liberal reformers, there are some signs of light. Al Watan, a local daily, reports that a ministerial committee is considering changes to the way the death penalty is applied, from public beheading by sword to execution by firing squad. The few officially sanctioned swordsmen are having trouble commuting from one execution to another fast enough.

Democrats have in recent decades developed a spotty record of waging serious Senate races in what was once the party's “solid South.” Since Strom Thurmond, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan lured the region to the Republican ballot line with coded messages that were intended to exploit the racial divisions that President Lyndon Johnson sought to address when they signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, it is no secret that Democrats have had a harder and harder time gaining traction in the states of the Deep South. Ad Policy
The party has not won a contest for an open Senate seat in the region for years. In many states, it has struggled to recruit credible candidates. Indeed, things were so bad in 2014 that it barely made an effort to defend its last incumbent in the region, then–Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu, in the runoff election that ultimately turned them out of office. “They just walked away from this race,” said Landrieu as they strove to retain a historically Democratic seat.
After Landrieu was defeated, a New York Times headline read: “Demise of the Southern Democrat Is Now Nearly Complete.”
So when Alabama Democrats and supporters of the national party's old “50-state strategy” started arguing over the summer that Democrats needed to get serious about the race to fill the Alabama US Senate seat that had been vacated by the region's most lamentable contribution to the Trump cabinet—Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III—the notion was not universally embraced. Yes, the Democratic nominee for the seat was an impressive man: Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor with deep roots in the state and impeccable law-enforcement credentials. But was Alabama really ready to elect a candidate who proudly prosecuted the extremists who targeted abortion clinics and went after the racists who were responsible for the 1963 bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham?
Now, however, the Alabama seat is clearly in play; not because the state is veering left (even if the results of the recent mayoral race in Birmingham represent an encouraging embrace of progressivism) but because the Republicans nominated a horrible person as their candidate to fill the Sessions seat.
Judge Roy Moore was the worst of the worst—a lawless scoundrel who kept getting bumped off the state's high court—even before they were accused this week of molesting teenage girls. With the shocking news reports that Moore “made sexual or romantic overtures to [girls] when they were teenagers and they were in their 30s,” national Republicans who retain a shred of conscience are calling for their party's nominee in Alabama's December 12 special election to quit the contest.
“If these allegations are true, they must step aside,” Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said after The Washington Post published a story based on interviews with women who recalled the days when a 30-something Moore was on the prowl for young girls in the late 1970s and early '80s. Current Issue View our current issue
Moore is not about to quit this contest. This scandal-plagued candidate is used to being controversial, and they have trained Alabama Republicans to distrust not just the news media that report on them but also the Republican establishment that sometimes objects to him. Moore is going to keep on running, issuing carefully worded denials of their sordid past, echoing Donald Trump's talk about “fake news,” and enjoying the support of prominent Republican officials like Alabama State Auditor Jim Zeigler, who has offered a biblical defense of Moore: “Zechariah was extremely old to marry Elizabeth and they became the parents of John the Baptist. Also take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus.”
“There's just nothing immoral or illegal here,” drawls Zeigler. “Maybe just a little bit unusual.”
On the chance that a silent majority of Alabama voters might think that what's going on with Moore is more than “just a little bit unusual,” what was already a competitive race is going to become the most intense special election for a US Senate seat in years. It will matter even more because of the narrow divide within the Senate, where Republicans have the advantage but must wrestle with dissension within their caucus. The combination of factors could make the Alabama contest one of the most politically dynamic Senate special elections in decades—perhaps since the contest 60 years ago that flipped the late Senator Joe McCarthy's Wisconsin seat to insurgent Democrat Bill Proxmire, in a result that solidified Democratic control of the Senate and that moved the Senate Democratic Caucus to the left as the chamber was about to take final action on the Civil Rights Act of 1957.
At this point, national Democrats have to get serious about the Alabama contest. They can't play on the margins or hope to sneak up on Moore and the Republicans. This race is going to be a top news story from now until December 12. Moore will claim that Democrats in Washington are out to get him, no matter what Democrats in Washington do. So they might as well do something.
But what? Should they throw everything they've got into a campaign against Roy Moore? No, they should throw everything they've got into a campaign for Doug Jones.
The Democratic nominee for the Alabama Senate seat is a strikingly qualified and able contender. A former United States Attorney and onetime staff counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee, they have decades of legal and political experience in Alabama. And Jones has a record of personal accomplishment and moral commitment that stands in stark contrast to Moore's dismal story.
The Democrat is best known for their efforts in the late 1990s and early 2000s to finally achieve a measure of justice in the case of the September 15, 1963, Birmingham bombing that left four little girls—Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson and Carol Denise McNair—dead in their church. Jones is credited with playing an essential role in winning murder convictions against two of the killers almost 40 years after the bombing—and after many other attempts to hold the racists to account had failed. Frequently honored for their work on not just civil-rights cases but also cases involving women's rights, workers' rights, and the environment, Jones is hailed by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist and author Diane McWhorter as “bold and aggressive, but also willing to take a risk to be on the right side of history.”
Polls taken since the Republican runoff primary that nominated Moore have shown the race to be competitive. Moore's generally been ahead, but not generally by much. And the latest revelations, along with the prospect that there may be more trouble for the Republican, make this is going to be a real race in a deep-red state.
Jones said before the latest stories about Moore broke, “I think the people in this state are looking at themselves and are saying, ‘we're tired of being embarrassed.'”
If Doug Jones is right about their native state's capacity for embarrassment, then Democrats in Alabama and across the country have every reason—and every responsibility—to make a major play for Alabama this fall. But that play should not be so focused on the embarrassment that is Roy Moore. It should be focused on telling Alabamans of all that Doug Jones has done to make them proud.
Murders and not extrajudicial killings (EJKs) have been taking place the past year as the Duterte administration undertakes a relentless campaign against illegal drugs, former president Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III has said.
“If you say there are extrajudicial killings, then it means there is judicial killing. But I remember, we do not have the death penalty, so there is no judicial killing. Therefore, there is no extrajudicial killing. No judicial, no extrajudicial. So clearly, there is murder, there is homicide taking place,” Aquino said in Filipino.

Asked if the killings of the suspected drug pushers and users were state-sponsored, Aquino said they have no evidence to claim such but what is clear is that the “state has an obligation to protect all its citizens and go after all those who have committed infractions against society.”
“May pinatay. May pumatay. Hanapin yung pumatay at bigyan ng kaukulang parusa,” Aquino said.
(Someone was murdered. Someone killed him. Go after the murderer and bring them to justice.)
Aquino spoke to reporters on Monday at the commemoration of the 34th death anniversary of their father, Senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino, Jr., whose assassination led to the Edsa People Power Revolution in 1983. The peaceful uprising toppled the Marcos dictatorship and restored democracy in the country after nearly 20 years of authoritarian rule.
“I've always said that however which way one looks at it, in the Constitution and in the church that I belong to, one death is one too many,” the former president said.
Senator Antonio “Sonny” Trillanes IV, a fierce critic of the Duterte administration, said that based on Philippine National Police (PNP) data, more than 3,000 suspected drug personalities have been killed since last year; more than 2,000 in drug-related homicide or murder; and another more than 5,000 deaths classified as “under investigation,” which includes those killed by “riding-in-tandem” assailants.
“But even if it's just 1,000 dead, that's just too many,” said Trillanes, who attended a mass for Ninoy Aquino for the first time last Monday.
Last week had been a bloody and brutal one in the Duterte administration's campaign to end illegal drugs: 82 suspects dead in less than a week. Police claimed that the suspects fought back while resisting arrest, prompting arresting officers to shoot them dead.
But it was the killing of 17-year-old Kian Loyd delos Santos on the night of August 16 that sparked public outrage.
ADVERTISEMENT
Aquino themselves expressed shock over the death of Delos Santos — and other children who were classified as “collateral damage” in the war against drugs.
Like all those before him, Delos Santos, authorities claimed, had a gun and tried to shoot the police officers. An autopsy report showed that the Grade 12 student was shot three times, with one bullet shattering their brain.
Aquino supported an investigation into the death of Delos Santos but hoped this would not “drag for too long,” fearing the delay would result in the muddling of the case. Aquino said they also had several questions in mind about the boy's killing.
The former president earlier earned the ire of Duterte after they criticized the administration's war on drugs. Duterte unleashed invectives against Aquino, who kept their cool.
Of Duterte's angry rant against him, Aquino ascribed it to their successor's “style.”
“As they say, no one can be onion-skinned. Of course, I wasn't happy about it. But perhaps, they might see some logic in what I said, so it would be worth it,” Aquino said, referring to Duterte unleashing invectives against him. CBB

The naked trend has been successful in Hollywood, with reality show participants shedding their threads in favour of going more au naturel in programmes such as "Naked and Afraid" on the Discovery Channel.
Axel Eriksson, programme director at SBS Discovery said that they could see a market for more naked bodies on Swedish television. "Naked people stir up emotions, and a Swedish programme of this genre would get noticed and probably cause a discussion," they told the Aftonbladet daily. Eriksson said that they had already received some proposals regarding Swedish remakes of foreign programmes containing nudity and was mulling the idea. "As long as there is an interesting storyline and the nudity becomes a tool for telling that story, not just attention seeking, I definitely think there is an audience for this format." Eriksson's broadcasting colleague Karin Stjärne at MTG, owner of channels such as TV3 and TV6, was slightly more lukewarm in their view of the somewhat staid US approach to the concept.
"It won't be enough to flash a boob," they told the newspaper. "I think the Swedish audience has quite a natural approach to our bodies."
If the concept were to take off in Sweden it would not however be the first time reality television viewers have been treated to the fleshy smorgasbord of the human body.
Perhaps the most notorious exponent of the "I'll show you mine" genre was Jan O. Jansson a.k.a. "Naked Janne" who graced a 2003 series of the agricultural dating show The Farm (Farmen).
Jansson became Naked Janne with the people after they spent a large part of the series mucking out in their birthday suit.
The teacher from Uppsala in eastern Sweden had previously served as chairperson of a naturist association and later penned a book about their farm life fame entitled "The Naked Truth".
Cape Verde will take on Tunisia on Sunday with a number of players born abroad but more often African countries have lost out to European nations in dual-eligiblity battles
By Brian Oliver
When Marseille 's Mario Lemina was named by Gabon in their 23-man squad for the Africa Cup of Nations, they said ‘no thanks'. They were part of France 's winning team at the Under-20 World Cup in 2013 and fancies their chances of a call-up to Didier Deschamps ' senior side.Despite their family ties, and the fact that they were born in Gabon, Lemina joins a long and illustrious list of names who have been lost to Africa's national teams.It started decades ago with two of the greats of world football, Eusebio and Mario Coluna. They won the European Cup with Benfica and collectively played more than 120 times for Portugal, despite having lived in Mozambique (then Portuguese East Africa) until they were 18 and 19 respectively.The Cup of Nations started in 1957 but Mozambique had no professional football league and played no meaningful international matches back then. Eusebio and Coluna had little choice but to represent Portugal.More recently, one of the high-profile players who could have featured at the Cup of Nations was Henrik Larsson, a Champions League winner with Barcelona in 2006 and one of Celtic's most popular players.Larsson was raised in Sweden but was eligible, via their father, to represent Cape Verde. It was never going to happen, though.“I will be cheering for Cape Verde in the Cup of Nations,” Larsson told, “but nobody ever said I should play for them, because I started playing for age groups for Sweden when I was young. Anyway, I am Swedish. It might have been an option if I hadn't played for Sweden so early but it was just never considered.“I have been there twice and on one of my visits there was a qualifying match on television. Cape Verde had some good players – plenty from the Portuguese league (there are seven in their Cup of Nations squad) – and they were technically good. They did well last time and they look like a good team.”Many dual-national players have opted to represent European rather than African teams, including three who won the 1998 World Cup for France – Zinedine Zidane (Algeria), Marcel Desailly (Ghana) and Claude Makelele (DR Congo).It can be a tough call. The Boatengs, Jerome and Kevin-Prince, both played age-group football for Germany, where they were born, before opting for different countries. Kevin-Prince, now at Schalke, has a map of Ghana as one of their many tattoos and has played for the Black Stars. Their half-brother Jerome is a regular for Germany.Nigeria's biggest loss in recent years is Bayern Munich's David Alaba, whose father is Yoruba. Alaba, the versatile midfielder and left-back, was raised in Austria and became that nation's youngest capped player aged 17.Sampdoria's striker Stefano Okaka, born and raised in Italy, had talked about playing for Nigeria but is now part of the Azzurri set-up, as is the Juventus defender Angelo Ogbonna. The most high-profile Italian-African, of course, is Mario Balotelli, who could have played for Ghana.

— Fifteen years following the end of the American Civil War, Union general Lew Wallace, leader of the 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment, wrote the acclaimed novel “Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.”
Friday, the latest film adaptation of Wallace's Ben-Hur was released into theaters to lackluster reviews. Saturday, the NASL-leading Indy Eleven, which derives its moniker from the 11th Indiana Regiment, similarly stumbled. Indy gave away two leads before allowing an added-time goal to Omar Bravo to hand the Carolina RailHawks a 3-2 victory. The win snapped a five-match winless skid for Carolina; the loss snapped Indy Eleven's four-game win streak.
“We've stood here a few times over the last month or two, and things haven't quite gone our way,” said RailHawks manager Colin Clarke. “But I thought we got what we deserved tonight. We were the better team over the 90 minutes. I was delighted for the players, and it was a superb turnout from the crowd—they've been wanting this. Now we have to make sure we build on this.”
In the 20th minute, Indy Eleven kicked off the scoring when team captain Greg Janicki outleapt a cast of RailHawks defenders and nodded in a Brad Ring corner kick for a 1-0 lead. The RailHawks equalized just three minutes later, when forward Matt Fondy accepted an assist from Nazmi Albadawi, then whirled inside the half-moon and fired past Indy goalkeeper Jon Busch to even the scoreline at 1-1. It was Fondy's fifth goal since joining Carolina after the spring season, tying them with Brian Shriver for the team lead. It was also Albadawi's NASL-leading seventh assist.
In the 29th minute, Carolina center back Drew Beckie was dispossessed by Souleymane Youla, then compounded their error by yanking Youla to the ground in the area. Eamon Zayed converted the ensuing PK—his 12th goal this year—to reclaim Indy's lead, 2-1.
The RailHawks found a whoopsy-daisy equalizer in the 54th minute. A Busch punch-out found fullback Steven Miller on the right wing. Miller's volley missed its mark, but the curler sailed over Busch an Janicki before nestling into the far net to knot the match at 2-2.
“To be honest, we've been working a lot on balls to the opposite side of the field,” Miller said. “I'm told to get high and push in on their outside midfielder. Da Luz played a phenomenal ball across, got punched out by the keeper and it bounced out to me. I kind of lit up and tried to put it in a dangerous spot. I'm not going to say if it was a cross or shot. I just tried to put it in a dangerous spot, and luckily enough it went in.”
In the 63rd minute, referee Mark Kadlecik whistled a penalty against Janicki for taking down Tiyi Shipalane atop the area. But after consulting with the linesman, Kadlecik waved off the penalty and instead awarded a free kick.
As a draw appeared inevitable well into second-half added time, the law of averages saw a return penalty whistled against Indy Eleven. Ring put hand to a Jonny Orlando dribble, prompting Kadlecik to point to the spot. After an apparent attempt to freeze the keeper, Bravo buried the PK to send the RailHawks' partisans into hysterics and Carolina to a 3-2 victory.
It was Bravo's fourth goal in five games, and gave them a result over Indy's Gerardo Torrado, their old Liga MX foe. Moreover, Saturday was the RailHawks' third consecutive attendance over 6,000 since Bravo arrived on loan.
“Everyone thinks of Omar coming in and scoring goals,” Clarke said. “He brings so much more to the table, just as a leader. He's a quality person, very humble, but they want to win trophies. He's had their talks with the boys and made their comments, and they sit up and listen. It's coming from someone who has won at every single level he's ever played. They know what it takes to win.”
Indy Eleven manager Tim Hankinson said their players hit a fatigue point because of both the humidity and the larger WakeMed Soccer Stadium pitch.
“I was disappointed with how the final goal came about,” said Indy manager Tim Hankinson. “All it takes it one more possession play and being smart. Down the stretch, we weren't good enough to deal with some of the things coming in at us.”
After consecutive draws against the bottom two teams in the league, Carolina found an unlikely, and much-needed, victory against the league-leading Eleven, which hung a 4-1 win on Carolina to clinch the NASL spring championship in early June. The RailHawks reportedly held a team meeting earlier this week, which Miller said focused on “staying the course.”
“We wanted to know where we were in the league,” Miller said. “We're not that far off. We haven't been playing great, but we haven't been playing terrible. We just haven't been getting results. We thought we could do better, especially at home.”
The victory pushes the RailHawks (7-5-7, 26 pts.) into the sixth position in the overall NASL table, five points shy of fourth-place Minnesota United with a game in hand. Carolina hits the road to face the New York Cosmos next weekend. Carolina then returns to WakeMed Soccer Park on Saturday, Sept. 3 to host the Jacksonville Armada.

A new report from Buzzfeed News details an alleged "cult" run by R&B singer R. Kelly.
The extensive piece, written by Jim DeRogatis, quotes distressed parents who have expressed concern about their daughters relationship with the Chicago native. DeRogatis also speaks with three former employees of Kelly, who corroborate the parents concerns that Kelly houses, and abuses the lives of, six women living in Chicago and Atlanta.
Parents J. and Tim explain to DeRogatis that after previously meeting with the 50 year-old singer under the guise of music industry mentorship, R. Kelly flew their 19 year-old daughter out to a show in 2015. Since then, J. and Tim have only heard from them twice and the parents have been fighting for their return since they last saw them in 2016. Two other parents featured in the report make similar claims.
In the chilling report, three folks within Kelly's circle—Cheryl Mack, Kitti Jones, and Asante McGee—explain that the singer dictates every aspect of the girls lives: "what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep, and how they engage in sexual encounters that they record" and if rules are broken, they are punished verbally and sexually.
The women are not technically considered missing persons because of age of consent laws.
Though this story is new, DeRogatis has been reporting on Kelly for the better part of two decades. They most famously reported about sexual assault accusations and lawsuits filed against Kelly for The Chicago Reader—and turned over a 30 minute video anonymously left in their mailbox that later resulted in Kelly being charged with creating child pornography in 2013.
The recent revelations have caused "R. Kelly" to trend on Twitter. Many people have spent the morning expressing their disgust and concern, while also referring to DeRogatis previous work to expose the nefarious side of the singer.

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare multiplayer features a brand-new Gesture system in which players are able to make gestures while in-game, not at the end of the game only like how its done in Call of Duty: Black Ops 3.
In an interview with charlieINTEL, Infinity Ward's Multiplayer Project Director Jordan Hirsh talked about what to expect from this gesture system.
“We have gestures in-game now. Where you can essentially press the d-pad and do an off-hand gesture. The gestures are in-game…so basically you can run around and flip someone off or do the rock-on thing, preferably before you kill someone so they can see it in the kill cam.”
Players are able to actually make gestures against enemies, in which the enemies can see these gestures in their kill-cam using the d-pad. Gestures include the middle-finger and more off hand gestures.
Hirsh clarified that they have not finalized how they want to handle the celebration at the end of the match They said something is in development, but they do not have a final decision yet for what that will be at launch in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare.

The situation at the station during Oktoberfest which begins in two weeks will already be testing for police, Bavarian interior minister Joachim Hermann told the Münchner Merkur on Friday.
If refugees arrive in the numbers seen on Tuesday the station would get very crowded, they added.
Munich station is the main arrival point for refugees currently travelling to Germany via Hungary. On Tuesday alone an estimated 1,500 asylum seekers arrived at the station.
There were reports in Hungarian media on Friday of clashes between refugees and a mob of football hooligans in Budapest's Keleti station, and Munich authorities will be hoping to avoid a repeat.
"It's also impossible to predict how some drunken Oktoberfest visitors will behave,“ Hermann said, pointing out that every year during the beer festival there are incidences of violence at Munich's main transport hub.
The Christian Social Union (CSU) politician told the paper they had demanded from federal interior minister Thomas de Maizière that they strengthen the Bavarian police with reinforcements from other German states.
"The minister promised me the would make it a priority,“ said Hermann, although they could not yet say how many more officers would be supplied to the Bavarian capital.
Thomas Baumann, spokesperson for the Munich police, said that they would "find a solution to ensure that the masses of people are channeled through correctly."
During Oktoberfest the police's current policy of meeting refugees on the station platform and accompanying them to a wing of the station called the Starnberg wing will continue, minimizing contact between refugees and party-goers, reports the Münchner Merkur.
Violence has long been recognized as an unwanted side effect of the high levels of alcohol consumption which happen at Oktoberfest.
In 2014 police reported a drop in crime on previous years. But 16 cases of grievous bodily harm were reported, while a British man was one of two people raped during the sixteen-day event.
JNS.org – Monaco's Prince Albert II apologized Thursday for their country's history of deporting Jews to Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust. During the period, Monaco police had rounded up and deported Jews in the small principality, including those who escaped to Monaco thinking they would be safe in what was considered a neutral country.
“To say this today is to recognize a fact. To say it today, on this day, before you, is to ask forgiveness,” Prince Albert said in a speech attended by Monaco's chief rabbi and other prominent Monaco Jewish figures, such as renowned Nazi hunters and Holocaust researchers Serge and Beate Klarsfeld.
The prince also unveiled a monument commemorating the deported Jews at the Monaco cemetery, on a date marking 73 years since Monaco authorities rounded up more than 60 Jews from Aug. 27-28, 1942. In total, about 90 people were deported from Monaco, and of those only nine survived the Holocaust.
“We committed the irreparable in handing over…women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,” Prince Albert said, the Associated Press reported.
”We did not protect them. It was our responsibility. In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality,” they said.
Miami Heat guard Gerald Green has been released from Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Channel 10 reported Saturday.
The Heat declined comment and offered no update on the condition of Green, who was hospitalized Wednesday.
According to the transcript of the 911 call of the incident, a woman at the front desk of Green's condo is heard on the recording saying, "I have a resident that just passed out. He's bleeding."
The Heat also declined comment before Friday's loss to the Indiana Pacers at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. Green has missed the team's past three games, including Tuesday's night's home game against the Atlanta Hawks, when the team reported they were ill.
The Heat next play Sunday at 6 p.m. at AmericanAirlines Arena, at the start of a seven-game homestand.
The Heat's most recent comments on Green came Thursday, before the team's road victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, when coach Erik Spoelstra said, "We're grateful that he's safe and he's healthy right now. And our thoughts are with them and their family."
Udonis Haslem says Heat releived Gerald Green is OK, with team returning focus to the court. Udonis Haslem says Heat releived Gerald Green is OK, with team returning focus to the court. SEE MORE VIDEOS
Several Heat players have been in communication with Green, including guards Dwyane Wade and Mario Chalmers, who lives in the same Miami condo building as Green and was in the ambulance at Green's side when /Green was transported Wednesday.
Miami Fire-Rescue called Miami Police for "assistance" during a medical call at the Marquis Residences at 1100 Biscayne Blvd. on Wednesday at 11 a.m., authorities said.
Green in July signed a one-year veteran-minimum contract with the Heat and had scored consistently off the bench during the Heat's early-season games, averaging 10.3 points in 21.6 minutes per game.

“You've just abandoned the Reagan Democrats with this amnesty bill. It was the loss of working class voters in swing states that cost us the 2012 election, not the Hispanic vote.... You disrespect Hispanics with your assumption that they desire ignoring the rule of law.”
— Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin (R) in a Facebook post titled “Great Job, GOP Establishment, June 28, 2013
Given how many variables can affect a national election, it is sometimes foolhardy to suggest one group or another swung the election. For instance, President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney split 49-49 percent among heterosexuals, while Obama overwhelmingly (76-22 percent) won the votes of gays. But just focusing on that fact would ignore the efforts made by Obama to reach out to other groups to build their winning coalition.
Palin's comment, posted in response to bipartisan passage of a comprehensive immigration bill in the Senate, struck us as interesting because it assumed Romney lost the so-called Reagan Democrats and that Hispanic voters do not favor a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. What do the data show? (We were assisted by Scott Clement, analyst at The Washington Post's Capital Insight, in finding some of these data.)
The Facts
First of all, there have been a whole series of polls asking Hispanics about their views on overhauling immigration laws. Excluding advocacy polls with loaded questions, there is a consensus that Hispanics overwhelmingly support a path to citizenship. Here are two key samples:
Voter exit poll, 2012: 77 percent of Hispanics believe illegal immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status.
WSJ-NBC poll, April 2013: 82 percent of Hispanics either strongly favor or somewhat favor a pathway to citizenship.
The 2012 exit poll of voters also found that Americans, by a margin of 65 to 29 percent, believe illegal immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status. The WSJ-NBC poll found 64 percent of all Americans favor a pathway to citizenship.
Okay, so a core part of Palin's assumption is just simply wrong. What about their notion that the loss of “working class voters” in swing states cost the GOP the election? That is a bit more fuzzy, in part because it depends on the definition of “working class” — Clement says there are a dozen different ways to define the term — but Palin's reasoning is also debatable.
The most basic way to define a working-class voter is someone who lacks a college degree. In 2012, Obama won 51 percent of the national popular vote among non-college voters, 50 percent among college voters. The gap, in fact, has been fairly narrow over the last eight elections, with Democrats doing better among non-college voters than college graduates four times, Republicans four times.
But note that Palin referred to “Reagan Democrats.” This generally refers to white working-class Northern voters. Again, there are different ways to slice this. The National Journal has a handy interactive which allows you to examine the results of the elections between 1980 and 2008, slicing and dicing various categories.
You can see that Republicans already had an edge among white non-college voters — but not among white Democratic non-college voters. Even Reagan lost those voters by a margin of 68 to 27 percent, and the gap only increased in later elections. In fact, many of statistics showing how poorly Democrats do among white voters change substantially when Southern voters are removed; Democrats are competitive with Republicans in winning white voters, especially working-class voters, in New England, the Midwest and the West Coast.
Palin specifically mentioned the loss of Reagan Democrats in swing states. Let's take a look at Ohio, the ultimate swing state, which Obama won 51 to 48 percent. Using an interactive that shows the difference between 2008 and 2012, you can see that Romney improved over John McCain's share of white voters, by 5 percentage points, and among people with incomes of less than $30,000 a year; Obama slightly improved among voters with no college degree.
So why did Romney lose even after apparently improving their share of white working class voters? The reason is that white voters made up a smaller percentage of the overall vote in Ohio, falling four percentage points to 79 percent, while the African American vote increased four percentage points, to 15 percent.
A similar dynamic took place in Pennsylvania, where Obama experienced a six percentage point decline in the share of the white vote, but still won because Latinos and other voters of color increased their share of the vote — and went overwhelmingly for the president.
Another key swing state was Colorado, where again Obama lost ground among white voters but minority voters bolstered their share of the electorate and carried the president to victory. In Colorado, Obama's share of the Hispanic vote was an astonishing 87 percent. (These figures come from an interesting analysis, “The Obama Coalition in the 2012 Election and Beyond,” by Ruy Teixeira and John Halpin.)
Overall, in fact, Obama lost ground among white working-class voters, garnering 36 percent in 2012, compared to 40 percent in 2008, according to a recent article in the New Republic by Teixeira and Andrew Levison. The article notes that even these results may have been distorted by unique events, giving Obama a greater share of such voters than might ordinarily be expected: “In 2008 the financial crisis and a desire to ‘clean house' boosted white working class support for Obama. In 2012, the GOP fielded a uniquely aloof and unsympathetic Republican candidate.”
In a fascinating article titled “The Case of the Missing White Voters, Revisited,” for Real Clear Politics, Sean Trende concludes, based on population growth, that there were about 6 million white voters who failed to come to the polls. They identify them as “H. Ross Perot voters” — largely downscale, Northern, rural whites. That may not be quite the same as “Reagan Democrats,” but close enough.
But Trende also concludes that these missing voters, by themselves, were not enough to cost Romney the election because they would have needed to win almost 90 percent of these votes; Trende estimated that Romney at best would have won 70 percent.
The Pinocchio Test
Even given the different ways one can slice poll data, we see little evidence for Palin's assertions.
If anything, Obama did more poorly among white working-class voters in 2012 than in 2008, even in key swing states. Palin could be talking about the fact that not as many anticipated white voters showed up at the polls, but as Trende shows, even if those missing voters had cast ballots, it would not have made a difference in 2012 election result.
Meanwhile, their claim on Hispanic voters is not borne out by the data that show overwhelming support for policies that would provide a path to citizenship.

On Thursday, Fox News' Tucker Carlson revealed that W. Kamau Bell, host of CNN's “The United Shades of America,” was a featured speaker at Antifa's “No Hate in the Bay” rally in Berkeley, California. CNN, Carlson said, was silent when they asked about Bell “stoking violent extremism as a sidegig.”
According to Fox News Insider:
(Carlson) said that Bell willingly and earnestly partook in the raucous protest.
“They hate this country. They want to tear it down. They are totalitarian in their beliefs and in their aims,” Carlson said.
Bell called Patriot Prayer rallygoers “Nazis” and cheered their departure as the Antifa demonstrators overran the other collective.
Carlson said Bell was content in labeling their enemies Nazis and that they willfully incited rage with their rhetoric.
Carlson said their program would swiftly be cancelled if they participated in a right-wing version of Bell's rally – where conservatives donned masks and clutched weapons, running Hillary Clinton supporters out of the area with violence in the name of the Second Amendment and Evangelical Christianity.
Let that sink in — a CNN host thinks people attending a prayer rally are Nazis. And the network is silent.
Here's video of the segment:

“If you're not willing to say you want a world safe for all Americans equally, you are peddling hate, and Bell is,” Carlson said.
Bell continued their hateful tirade on Twitter:
Berkeley shouldn't just come together when the Nazis/KKK kids/Fault Right/white supremacists show up. We should be like this everyday… — W. Kamau Bell (@wkamaubell) August 28, 2017
So to be clear, I want Berkeley & the country & the world & the known & unknown universe to be supportive, equitable, & fair to all of us. — W. Kamau Bell (@wkamaubell) August 28, 2017
Unless, of course, one happens to hold a political view Bell doesn't agree with.
They eventually got around to mentioning white people:
& even white ppl… especially the white allies out in those Berkeley streets today & the white half of my children. 😁✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼✊🏻✊ — W. Kamau Bell (@wkamaubell) August 28, 2017
One person told Bell:
If it is fair game to label all Trump conservatives who attend free speech rallies Nazis… then…? What goes around, comes around, sir. — Mistert51 (@kneehiorange) September 1, 2017
Of course, Bell's supporters agreed, but some wondered why Bell would continue to divide America?
https://twitter.com/JH23250452/status/903419538028580865
As we reported, Berkeley police stood down and allowed Antifa terrorists, perhaps motivated by Bell, to beat and attack those they think are Nazis:
Patriot Prayer had cancelled their march because of fears that proved to be utterly correct, that police would enable the terrorists rather than to protect the peaceful citizens. Even though Berkeley police stood down, they were still forced to arrest at least ten of the Antifa.
The same thing happened in San Francisco last week. The marchers cancelled but the terrorists of Antifa still showed up and committed acts of violence against anyone they suspected of being a Nazi. Liberals and the left-wing news media are holding up this terrorist group as freedom fighters the same way they have defended Al Qaeda and ISIS.
Berkeley Police Chief Andrew Greenwood seemed to give a green-light to Antifa violence, saying that “the need for separation simply didn't exist.”
“And as far as I am concerned there are some deep discussions that need to happen within our community about providing space for Antifa and some of the folks we saw here today,” they added. “The conversation is nowhere near done.”
Meanwhile, a White House petition calls upon the administration to officially designate Antifa as terrorists. The petition, which can be seen here, has garnered over 331,000 signatures.
That petition reads:
Terrorism is defined as “the use of violence and intimidation in pursuit of political aims”. This definition is the same definition used to declare ISIS and other groups, as terrorist organizations. AntiFa has earned this title due to its violent actions in multiple cities and their influence in the killings of multiple police officers throughout the United States. It is time for the pentagon to be consistent in its actions – and just as they rightfully declared ISIS a terror group, they must declare AntiFa a terror group – on the grounds of principle, integrity, morality, and safety.
The state of New Jersey has already labeled Antifa a domestic terror group.
It wasn't that long ago that CNN, the cable outlet seen by many as the least-trusted name in network news, was compared to ISIS. One can't help but wonder — does the network, which recently said all Trump voters are white supremacists by default — support domestic terrorism?

Getty Images Merkel's answers haven't satisfied either Obama or Trump.
“This is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it. This threat is real, and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it. If we could create NATO to face down the Soviet Union, we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have struck in Madrid and Amman; in London and Bali; in Washington and New York.”
President Donald Trump, last week? No, then–Sen. Barack Obama, in Berlin in 2008.
For all of the headlines and shock waves created by Trump's confrontational approach toward Germany — reinforced by yet another incendiary tweet on Tuesday — the issues the 45th president is raising with Europe's largest economy are not particularly new.
We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany, plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2017
Obama raised the two issues Trump identified — weak military spending and too large a trade deficit — on multiple occasions.
Check out this comment Obama made, with Merkel at their side, in Baden-Baden in 2009:
“It's not the Germans' fault that they make good products that the United States wants to buy. And we want to make sure that we're making good products that Germans want to buy. But if you look overall, there's probably going to need to be a rebalancing of who's spending, who's saving, what are the overall trade patterns.”
Also read: Trump provokes Merkel to reveal their true intention of dominating Europe
In 2010, Obama used a G-20 event to chastise European countries including Germany for reducing spending so quickly after the recession ended. “We must be flexible in adjusting the pace of consolidation and learn from the consequential mistakes of the past when stimulus was too quickly withdrawn and resulted in renewed economic hardships and recession,” Obama said.
Later, the calls from Obama on Germany were more focused on the need to provide Greece with debt relief, assistance that Merkel has been reticent to provide, as well as apologies for wiretapping the German head of state. But those themes — of spending more generally, and on the military in particular — did not go away.
In Obama's final months of office, Germany was one of six countries negatively singled out in the Treasury's “foreign-exchange policies of major trading partners” report, and it's hard to imagine anyone in the Trump administration disagreeing with a single word. Noting that Germany had the world's largest current-account surplus, the Obama administration said the surplus represented “substantial excess saving” that could be used to support German domestic demand and contribute to euro-area and global rebalancing. Germany also has “substantial” fiscal-policy space to provide additional support to demand, as well as the ability to encourage more private investment.
A quick look at the data explains the American frustration toward Germany. On military spending, Germany hasn't been at the NATO target of 2% of gross domestic product since 1991 — and, if anything, it's been moving further from, not closer to, the target, as data from the World Bank show.
Even if a new promise were entirely fulfilled by Germany, the country still be spending only 1.2% of GDP on defense in 2020.
Meanwhile, Germany's budget surplus last year reached the highest level since reunification.
Merkel may be right that, as they stated this weekend, the U.S. is no longer a reliable partner.
Germany hasn't been for a long time.

Prince performs in the United Arab Emirates in 2010. (Jumana El-Heloueh/Reuters)
Prince, we know, was quite particular about their work. They also left behind a treasure trove of it — literally, an entire vault. Add in Prince's pop-icon status and lack of a will, and we have a recipe for drama over what to do with their legacy.
It's already begun. New Prince recordings that were supposed to debut Friday, on the anniversary of their death, may not come out after the musician's estate filed a federal lawsuit against the sound engineer behind the EP's release. On Wednesday, a U.S. district judge halted the release of the music — at least until a future hearing to determine what happens next.
The dust-up underscores the messiness of music legends' posthumous careers, which can see many parties battling for creative control amid intense public interest in a body of work and millions of dollars in potential revenue.
In the suit filed in a county court last week before it was moved to federal court, Paisley Park Enterprises alleges the engineer, George Ian Boxill, doesn't legally own five recordings, and that in releasing them he's violating an agreement they signed with Prince that the artist had exclusive ownership over any recordings.
“Mr. Boxill maintained copies of certain tracks, waited until after Prince's tragic death, and is now attempting to release tracks without the authorization of the estate and in violation of the agreement and applicable law,” the estate said in a statement sent to media outlets.
Attorneys representing Boxill, whose credits include Janet Jackson, 2Pac and multiple Prince albums, did not immediately return a request for comment.
According to a news release announcing the new EP, “Deliverance,” released by the indie label RMA, Prince and Boxill co-wrote and co-produced all of the tracks starting in 2006, and “the majority of the sales” will benefit the late artist's estate.
“I believe ‘Deliverance' is a timely release with everything going on in the world today, and in light of the one-year anniversary of their passing. I hope when people hear Prince singing these songs it will bring comfort to many,” Boxill said in the release. “Prince once told me that they would go to bed every night thinking of ways to bypass major labels and get their music directly to the public. When considering how to release this important work, we decided to go independent because that's what Prince would have wanted.”
(A sixth song — the EP's title track, “Deliverance” — was actually released earlier this week on iTunes and Apple Music, but was later removed from the platforms. As of Friday, it was for sale on an RMA website, as the label's co-founder David Staley told Rolling Stone that it was exempt from Wednesday's temporary restraining order.)
Managing an artist's career after death can mean walking a tightrope of competing interests: treating the legacy with dignity, ensuring heirs get what's rightfully theirs and doing right by fans. It's especially complicated when a prolific artist like Prince didn't detail their wishes in a will — which also means their estate is subject to a hefty tax bill that needs to be paid. There's been some infighting among their siblings; accusations of mismanagement among some heirs about the estate advisers; and fans debating about how to honor a musician who famously distrusted record companies and lawyers — the same kind of entities now very involved with managing their career.
[Is Prince the best person who has ever done this whole music thing?]
Prince's estate has already signed a merchandising deal with the company Bravado. Their older catalogue has returned to most streaming services, two years after they pulled it from all except Tidal. The artist's Paisley Park home and studios have been turned into a museum managed by the same company that runs Graceland. Warner Bros. had a deal before Prince's death to control much of the music from their earlier career. And Universal struck a deal with the estate with plans to explore Prince's vault and release new albums — although that's been thrown into doubt amid reports that the company may try to nullify the deal over questions about the Warner Bros. assets.
For an estate like Prince's, there's enormous potential to generate money, and not just from music.
“There's tremendous, tremendous interest in doing things with their legacy, whether it's a motion picture, documentaries, Broadway, Cirque du Soleil,” former Sony and EMI executive Charles Koppelman, one of the estate's advisers, told Billboard in February.
[How death brought David Bowie a career breakthrough]
It's not uncommon for a musician to have a career boost after death. For instance, David Bowie's financial worth grew after their 2016 death, and their last album, “Blackstar,” released days before their death, was their first to reach the top spot on the Billboard charts.
Michael Jackson's career also had a revival. Before their death in 2009, their image had become linked to child molestation accusations, and their finances were thought to be in bad shape. But after they died, their status became cemented as the most consequential pop superstar, propelled by documentaries, books, albums and live shows. Coexecutors of Jackson's estate have made an estimated $1 billion since Jackson died, according to Forbes.
Much of a deceased artist's post-death career hinges on how much unreleased work they left behind. As many as 10 new Michael Jackson albums could be on the horizon. A pair of unreleased Bowie albums is expected to drop Saturday.
Prince, on the other hand, left so much music behind that “it probably won't be tapped in our lifetimes,” former Paisley Park employee Scott LeGere told the Star Tribune.

But should it be tapped? Prince was careful about their music and how it was made available. They took on record companies and pioneered the realm of digital releases.

Some believe there is an intrinsic, almost scholarly value in cracking open their vault. “The audience will be served things they've never heard before, things that will blow their minds,” Susan Rogers, a Berklee College of Music instructor and the studio engineer who worked on the album “Purple Rain,” told the Tribune. They then pointed to their music students: “I want these kids to understand how extraordinary they are, the sheer amount of their creative output.”
Despite the lack of a will, it doesn't take much guessing to assume how the pop icon would have felt about all the dealmaking with major companies. But Koppelman, the estate adviser, told Billboard that the estate retaining ownership rights over Prince's work is the biggest priority: “While some people may say ‘Why are you making all these deals? Prince wouldn't make these deals,' Prince never wanted to lose ownership and control of their creations.”
Such dealmaking, Koppelman argued, preserves that ownership and control.
“I do want to make clear that if Prince were here, we likely would not be making these deals,” Koppelman told the outlet. “Also, Prince would not be needing half the value of their estate right now.”

Sitting across from me in an ink-black suit, the type usually adorned by chilly eyed villains in spy flicks, the RZA looks giddy.
The lanky Wu-Tang leader has a lot to be excited about; since early this morning, he's been filming a music video with Interpol frontman Paul Banks, who's also perched in front of me in shadowy formal attire, for their much-anticipated Banks & Steelz project, first announced back in 2013 and finally seeing the light of day later this summer with the release of the album Anything But Words on August 26. The duo tells me that the video is inspired by the dynamics of Alejandro Iñárritu's Birdman, but to me it looks like a classic Shaolin production: Chess boards, smoke-filled backdrops and a beautiful woman holding back a snarly German Shepherd are all involved.
These things aren't what the RZA is grinning ear to ear about, however. He's cheesing because they just got back from a music shop in the neighborhood, where they snuck off in-between takes to purchase a shiny new trumpet—an instrument they have no idea how to play.
“Me and the owner [of the shop] just sat there for 30 minutes; they were trying to show me how to blow through the fucking mouthpiece,” they say, laughing. “He was farting with their mouth, ‘Brrrrhh.' I'm farting with my mouth. Just two music geeks.”
“Two music geeks” would also be a fitting band name for RZA and Banks, who are constantly bonding through their love for the art, from the equipment used to make it (RZA says Banks has inspired them to buy thousands of dollars worth of guitar pedals since they first met) to its influence on the world. Being around them, you notice they talk to each other like two wishful teenagers jamming in one of their parents' garage, always making references to lyrics they've written together or obscure pianists they both dig. As a result, RZA's trumpet story has Banks both chuckling and shrugging their shoulders at me like, “Yeah, we do this kind of shit.”
It's been this way since the pair first connected around 2011 as “buddies playing chess, making music together,” RZA says. Their first meeting took place at RZA's favorite noodle shop in New York City's Chinatown, a place supposedly run by a monk who was once featured on Stan Lee's Superhumans TV show for having a punch that hurts more than getting hit by a car. From then on, the two have been making songs together, first as rough demos and then, after an A&R showed interest in releasing a project, as fully formed compositions. Banks, who grew up on hip-hop, was a huge fan of RZA's before they met. (Conversely, RZA was only familiar with Interpol by name, a result of them having to play catch up after focusing on hip-hop for decades, they say). They aren't surprised, however, when the producer started sending them beat CDs that sounded nothing like the ominous grit of 36 Chambers or even the forward-thinking bounce of Bobby Digital. Instead, they were floored by how easily they related to the tracks as a vocalist.
“I quickly realized I was getting a lot of ideas,” they say. “Then the artistic propulsion happens where I'm not just over here as a fan; it's like, ‘Oh, I can engage with that work.'”
The two noticed that they bonded not only artistically but also logistically; when one would be out on tour, the other would be diligently working on the project in the studio, keeping things moving. RZA is especially adamant on this point, stating that Banks and Steelz is one of the first projects he's worked on where “the plane ain't gonna crash” if he's not there. One could assume he's referring to their Wu brethren, whom he's had a couple messy public spats with over the past few years. But they could also just be sharing their appreciation for having someone around who shares their vision, which is to create great music without parameters.
This approach lends itself to the blurring of genre lines, which, if you're following what these guys are good at, means a merger of rock and hip-hop. Both musicians are fully aware of the stigmas that come with that (Interpol, after all, was formed around the time of the “rap-rock” rage) and made a point of merging their talents as organically as possible. Their project's second single, “Giant, is an example of this, avoiding the sectioning of guitars and vocals by constructing a whirlpool of dramatic sounds. With no guidelines, these kinds of songs can appeal to fans of all types, RZA hopes. “[Our music] is like one of them seasonings… called ‘Flavor All'—you can put that shit on anything.”
Mass appeal is not really the objective here, though. Hearing the guys reminisce on special moments during the creative process, you realize that this record more than anything is about two accomplished musicians getting together to try something new.

Noisey: When did you guys start making music together?
Paul Banks: Must have been 2011, dude. I have a demo from 2011—the first vocal treatment I did on a RZA beat. I feel like that's info we should probably be fudging, but I can't take it back. I should have said it was 2013.
RZA: Why?
Banks: Well, the project just took us a long time. And at some point along the way, I started to feel bad that it was taking us a long time.
RZA: Yeah, but we aren't making a record. We hooked up as buddies playing chess, making music together. We didn't decide to make a record together ‘til like a couple years later. To my memory, my manager had played the demo of me and Paul to an A&R guy, and the A&R guy heard it and was like, “What was that? I want more of that.” With Paul, I'm very comfortable making music with him. He's a very capable musician and a talent within himself. One of the biggest things I like about working with Paul is that I can walk away, and the plane ain't gonna crash.
What makes you two a good fit in the studio?
A lot of my issues with music talent over the years is that a lot of things have happened by myself. A lot of times if I go home, the party is over. That's cool, but there's something about, to me as a guy who's been here for a while, having somebody else hold the other end of the stick for me. Holding that weight up. With some of the tracks, it's not like I had to be there. He'll go and zone out and maybe email me something. We recorded a lot of shit, like 30 records. We have that one song, “Love Your Life”…?
Banks: “Love Life.” That has my favorite lyrics on it, man. Everything has changed/the world is recorded… [starts singing a melody].
RZA: Wow.
Banks: That was a great one.
RZA: Yeah so if they leaf, I'm engaged and will continue. And if I leave, he's engaged and will continue. That's a good dynamic for making music. But the coolest part about it is that there is no decision made where it's like... Paul won't go and do something and say, “This is what it is.” It's always brought back. And for the first time in a long time, I was able to let myself be free. A lot of my performances on the album, “Giant” being an example, I was able to let Paul be like, “Nah, try that line again, Bobby, I like the energy of that.” Allow myself to be produced… that's something that my personality wouldn't afford me early on, you know what I mean? It's something I appreciate.

From a musical perspective, what made you two want to work together?
Banks: RZA's guitar playing, piano playing and singing were all a surprise. Great singer; really fantastic singer. Very skilled piano player. There's a track that also didn't make it where you just played the guitar part… I wouldn't have thought of those chords, and it's a really sweet sound.
RZA: “Anything But Words.” We are learning songs that took us a long time to format. Paul added a bridge—I don't know if you added it while you were in Panama?—and it was the missing element of it that made the song complete. You had put it later on in the song because you just let me rap, rap, rap. But it was actually that bridge that needed to come up in the front to make the song more melodic and have an extra layer of magic. The song evokes the world and evokes the life of a man, you know what I mean? That's one of my favorite songs. Once the bridge comes in… what were the words to the bridge?
Banks: “We always fight blind the light of our lives.”
RZA: “We always fight blind the light of our lives.” Then I come in after that: “Sitting on the porch, smoking a stogie in the moonlight, rocking back and forth in my chair, contemplating my own life.” And I wrote that lyric thinking, “Wow, what's going to happen when I reflect back on my shit?” When you're an artist, I don't think you ever look back. It's something weird about us. We're in it; it's like we're swimming. You're going to the next shore. But with this song, I took a moment to reflect, “Was it a good life that I've been doing? What have I been doing with myself?”
Hip-hop and rock have a long history, from when Run-DMC and Aerosmith collaborated to Bambataa's interactions with the downtown NYC punk scene. With that said, were you guys mindful at all of the stigmas that come with making a “rap-rock” record?
Banks: Rock and soul have an overlap, and soul and hip-hop have an overlap. So in that Venn diagram there's kind of an organic place where the two things can have a more organic overlap than the Run-DMC with Aerosmith song, where I feel that's just sort of like, “Now it's this, now it's that.” I mean the guitar riff kind of bridges the gap in that song pretty well, but I often feel that rock and hip-hop kind of just get stuck together, and I'm not interested in that kind of thing because I'm a big hip-hop fan, and I love hip-hop production. Ultimately as a singer what it comes down to is a chord progression that I can get ideas for as a vocalist. I look at it like where do I have ideas that are going to sound organic and how can I avoid any of those lame things that I've sensed in the past where the two genres were matched.
RZA: Let me paraphrase that for you: No, this is not a rock-hip-hop record. In the sense that I think Paul and I was conscious of it not being that. Now if you hear songs that remind you of it and take you to that world, that's just because we're writing songs with no intention.
Paul, I read that Straight Outta Compton was the first record that you loved. RZA, being a little older, I bet that hip-hop wasn't actually the first music you were into.
Banks: Thriller was the very first record. Then In Living Color was the first CD I bought with Cult Of Personality. First album that I got fully obsessed with top-to-bottom was Straight Outta Compton, yeah.
RZA: Basically my first years, from three and a half to seven years old, I lived down South with my uncle. “Country road take me home to the place where I belong…” that's the shit that's on the radio down there. I heard hip-hop first in the summer of 1976, OK? My family brought me back up to New York; my mother was ready for their children to come back. My cousin GZA lived in the building right down the street. They came and got me and took me to a block party. I got my ass whooped that night, aight? But I heard the DJ, I think they threw on “Apache,” one of them fuckin' breakbeats, and the guys started rhyming. And yo, I was addicted from that moment on, and not other music really meant anything to me until maybe the year 2000. I went through the whole 80s and 90s anti-everybody, besides soul music. One of the great musicians to ever live is Prince. I didn't catch Prince ‘til 2000. I'm glad I did catch him, though, but R&B made me nauseous. If I heard R&B while driving in the car, my stomach hurt.
So you weren't really familiar with Interpol at all when they started to make it big?
RZA: The name was stronger in my world than their music. I have a few lady friends that was into them. I actually started studying Interpol more after meeting Paul. I was late, yo. I was so egotistically intermittent; I'm not shy to say that. But, Interpol wrote some great songs and will continue to write more great songs, of course. “The Scale” was the one that really got me into them. Also, as a guy that has a guitar now, I can just appreciate what they're doing with it.
Photo by Devin Sarno, courtesy of Banks & Steelz
On our first song, “Protect Ya Neck,” if you remember GZA's first rap, they say, “First of all, who's your A&R? A mountain climber who plays the electric guitar? They don't know the meaning of dope.” So that's where we were at with rock, like, “Yo what is this shit? That shit ain't our shit.” Because we didn't understand it. Ol'Dirty had an older brother that played guitar, and he's GZA's guitarist on tour now.
Banks: I met them at Electric Lady Studios, and they told me the whole thing. In the bedroom next to ODB was this brother who was immersed in this whole other genre of music. It's just like whoa, that's crazy.
Beyond working together and being creative, did you two have any intentions with this project?
Banks: To share our music. You know, music is fun, and I'm drawn to do it. And I think you could never get through writing one song, let alone a whole record, unless you're enjoying what you're doing. I never really think of anything that deeply; I just want to make something that's cool to me, and if the pull is always there, then I'm being fulfilled creatively. I can't really say I had grand ambitions beyond saying, “Man that was fun and fulfilling and I learned a lot making music with RZA.”
RZA: I think I have a lyric that says, “I don't write rhyme for salary.” I'm not motivated by what someone else is thinking about it; it's actually just the living it out myself. Making this record and completing it—I do have a completion gene, you know what I mean? And after completing it, that's when I feel accomplished. It's like, “We did it, yo. We came together and put all this energy together.” Somebody may find it 10, 20, 100 years from now—who knows? Who cares? That shit is like, “Yeah, we did that.” That's the capture of time and energy that we put together in the studio. Like I said, I learned a lot as well from Paul. I'm better at what I do because of this experience.

A look at the doubtful umpiring decisions over the first three days of the Galle Test between Sri Lanka and India
In the Ashes, with much better technology and the Decision Review System available to the players, teams have been struggling to get many decisions overturned. In a series with no DRS and much inferior technology, the umpires in the Galle Test made at least six decisions that would have been overturned by DRS; four of these decisions would not have needed the ball-tracker projection, which is the major bone of contention for the BCCI
The mistakes began with the first real decision the umpires had to make in the match. Kaushal Silva went to hook Varun Aaron on day one, and was given out caught off their arm guard.
Soon after reaching their hundred on the second day, Virat Kohli was beaten while playing a sweep by an offbreak that pitched on middle and turned. This would have comfortably missed the leg stump, but they were given lbw.
Ajinkya Rahane's dismissal for a duck might look straightforward, but only if one did not keep the turning pitch in mind. The ball pitched outside off, turned in sharply to hit Rahane, who had a stride in, in front of middle. ESPNcricinfo's Hawk-Eye projection suggested the ball would have missed the leg stump comfortably.
In a decision similar to Silva's, Wriddhiman Saha was given out caught off the helmet after being beaten while attempting a hook.
Early in their knock in the second innings, Dinesh Chandimal top-edged a sweep onto their helmet and was caught at backward short leg. They aren't given out, and went on to score a counterattacking a hundred
Shortly after Chandimal's chance, Lahiru Thirimanne survived a clear bat-pad catch, a decision - like at least three others - that may have been overturned by basic and reliable technology

In 1919 Aleister Crowley, a mystic and occultist known as “The Great Beast,” had a revelation. They and their followers had to create a sanctuary, a holy place that would enable them to live through the Law of Thelema on a daily basis. This ideal temple, the Abbey of Thelema, would be an anti-monastery. The occultists settled in Cefalù, a small fishing town of the Sicilian coast.
Crowley is a major figure of modern occultism, and was already well known at the turn of the century. Famous for introducing sex and drugs as sacramental rituals into a complex syncretic system they called Magick, Crowley believed in finding one's “True Will.” This principle is famously summed up the Law of Thelema: “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.” Followers were to shirk societal norms and follow hedonistic impulses. The inherent individualism of Thelemic values were later to be absorbed into the sixties counter-culture, and would turn the British occultist into a pop icon, the Oscar Wilde of esoterica. However, a full fifty years before the lukewarm mysticism of the Age of Aquarius, Crowley was busy creating their occult temple in Sicily.
For a small amount of money, Crowley and their lover, Leah Hirsig, rented a one story house facing the Mediterranean sea. The common room was dedicated to ritual practices and held a scarlet “magick” circle marked with the sign of the major Thelemic deities. Crowley's own bedroom, labeled by themselves as “la chambre des cauchemars” (or “the room of nightmares”) was entirely hand-painted by the occultist with explicitly erotic frescos, hermaphroditic goblins, and vividly colored monsters. This private room was used for specific night initiations involving psychoactive drugs which gave terrifying cinematic life to this Bosch-like vision of hellish debauchery.
Crowley considered their temple a school of magick, and gave it an appropriately collegiate motto: “Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum”–”A College towards the Holy Spirit.”
Crowley's Cefalù period was one of the most prolific and happy of their life, even as they suffered from drug addiction and had to write the scandalous Diary of a Drug Fiend to finance their community. The growing interest in dark magic and the occult provided them with an ample student body (pun intended). But in 1922, the experience in monasticism ended when Raoul Loveday, a young disciple, tragically died from typhoid fever contracted from drinking spring water.
Crowley and their people were evicted by Mussolini's regime in 1923. The dictator had no sympathy for pornographic art or mysticism. Once the Abbey closed, the villagers whitewashed the murals, which they somewhat correctly saw as demonic. This erased much of the history and work of Crowley in Cefalù. Afterwards, the house was considered haunted and remained abandoned until 1955, when Kenneth Anger, an experimental filmmaker and follower of Crowley, located the ruins of the villa and attempted (unsuccessfully) to restore the Chambre des Cauchemars.
The Abbey of Thelema is still there, a hidden monument of mysterious, magickal decay. Even as the old farmhouse crumbles down after decades of abandon, it's still possible to visit and witness a few scant remains of the wall paintings, giving you a glimpse into Crowley's transgressive cosmology.
As of 2010 the Abbey was up for sale for 1.5 Million Euro. There are currently no reported buyers.
WASHINGTON ― Mandy Martin, a 40-year-old woman living in Louisiana, talks to their husband on the phone for about an hour a day. But because he's incarcerated at the Southern Correctional Center in Tallulah, those calls sometimes cost them more than $500 month. It's money that “I really don't have,” they told HuffPost in an interview. With other expenses, they said she's maxed out three credit cards and has had to rent out their house.
“I've tried to talk to them to tell him, ‘look, we really need to cut down on these phone calls,'” Martin said of their husband who is serving a 5-year sentence for theft. But, “it keeps them out of a state of depression being able to pick up and call...that's the only thing they feel in control [over], is being able to talk to their family.”
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under President Donald Trump has been scrutinized of late for facilitating an aggressive expansion of the conservative-leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group, as well as attempting to scrap strong net neutrality protections. But lost in the noise is how Trump's FCC chair, Ajit Pai, abandoned the Obama administration's attempt to cap exorbitant rates and fees that companies charge for phone service in prisons and jails—which impacts inmates and their families, like Martin.
Regular contact between inmates and family members can lower recidivism and help with rehabilitation. And until the 1990s, inmates could make calls at about the same rates as other people, according to The New York Times. But over the next few decades, private phone providers sent rates and fees skyrocketing.
In October 2015, the FCC voted 3-2 to cap state and federal prison phone rates at 11 cents a minute, and jail rates at 14 to 22 cents a minute. The FCC also discouraged commissions, which Democrats have described as kickbacks to prison operators. Prison phone providers sued to block the rule, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit put a hold on the rate caps in March 2016, although the cap on ancillary fees — charges tacked onto to inmate calls — was permitted to go into effect. In August 2016, the FCC, in an effort to appease opponents, slightly raised the rate caps (13 cents a minute for prisons, for example). But providers were able to block those, too until the legal fight is resolved.
One of the dissenters in the FCC's 2015 vote was then-Commissioner Pai, whom Trump later picked to chair the agency. They called the action “well-intentioned” but unlawful, and also talked about contraband cellphones being “thrown over prison fences stuffed into everything from footballs to dead cats.”
Under Pai, the FCC changed course. One week before February oral argument in appeals court, the agency told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that it would no longer defend a key component of the Obama administration's rule, namely, that the agency had the authority to cap in-state rates. (The agency did, however, defend the FCC's authority to regulate interstate calls, which refers to calls between states.)
Obviously, they're not trying to help us, they're trying to make money. Mandy Martin
In June, the court struck down the the regulations on in-state calls. Advocates see the Trump administration's position as a key factor. The court's decision “relied in large part on the fact that the FCC would not put forward a defense” for the agency's authority to regulate in-state phone rates and fees, said Lee Petro, pro bono counsel for prisoner advocates, the Wright Petitioners, a group of inmates' family members and loved ones.
There was the feeling that “if the FCC isn't going to defend its authority, why are we even here?” said Carrie Wilkinson, a campaign director for Human Rights Defense Center. (The appeals court issued a clarification order last week affirming that “we have carefully analyzed the contested provisions of the FCC's Order and found that they cannot survive review.”)
The court's order is not yet in effect as the Wright Petitioners have requested a rehearing.
More than 70 percent of all inmate calls are in-state, Petro claimed, so “the lack of price caps has permitted companies like Securus to charge more than $11 for a fifteen minute intrastate call for more than 60 correctional facilities in Michigan.” (A spokesperson for Securus Technologies did not respond to a request for comment.)
Martin, the woman from Louisiana, said she's already feeling the impacts. They sent HuffPost an email exchange showing that in February 2017, the local rate for Correct Solutions Group, their inmate phone company, was 25 cents per minute, plus tax. After the June court ruling, they said that jumped. Correct Solutions' website shows a current Louisiana rate of 30 cents per minute. (Correct Solutions did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did LaSalle Corrections, which operates the Southern Correctional Center.)
“Obviously, they're not trying to help us, they're trying to make money,” they said.

The Sun launched a fresh attack on Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday, dubbing them a "hypocrite" who had only accepted a place on the Privy Council so Labour would keep receiving £6.2 million a year of public funds.
The Sun
The front page, the first produced by the paper's new editor, Tony Gallagher, portrays Corbyn as a court jester and says they took a "humiliating personal climbdown ... so they can get their hands on £6.2m of state cash". One constitutional expert, Richard Gordon QC, is quoted in the article:
A refusal would have triggered a constitutional crisis and jeopardised £6.2m of annual funding, it is claimed.
Expert lawyer Richard Gordon QC said "rejection of PC membership by Jeremy Corbyn could raise issues relating to the status of the official opposition".
However, when contacted by BuzzFeed News, Gordon distanced themselves from the story and said their quote had nothing to do with Short money, the term for the public funding opposition parties receive. "My reasoning that refusal of a place [on the Privy Council] could (the word I allowed to be cited) raise constitutional issues was not related to Short money," they wrote in an email (emphasis his). "It was based on the constitutional relationship between the monarchy and main political party as the official opposition." Instead, the issues Gordon said could be raised by a refusal to join the council related to the constitutional relationship between the opposition and the crown. "However, I have little doubt that in the longer term and in practice that relationship could be changed," they continued, "which was why in the phrase I allowed to be quoted I suggested that the issues if they arose would be 'short-term'." In practice, such issues will not arise as Corbyn yesterday accepted a place on the council.  They are believed to have done so to more easily receive briefings on security issues. No other experts are quoted in The Sun's story to support its front-page claim.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Three hours before Thursday's series opener at AT&T Park, New York Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen entered the visiting manager's office and relayed the latest injury news to Terry Collins.
Steven Matz was experiencing shoulder discomfort, prompting the Mets to scratch them from Friday's game against the San Francisco Giants. Matz is being dispatched to New York for an examination with team doctors Monday.
"You guys walked out and Dan walked in," Collins said, referring to a pregame media session breaking up. "I went, 'You've got to be kidding me.' "
The Mets' celebrated young rotation is a shell of the hype these days. Matt Harvey underwent season-ending surgery July 18 to address thoracic outlet syndrome. Matz, already diagnosed with a bone spur in their pitching elbow that will need to be surgically removed after the season, awaits a more firm diagnosis about their shoulder. Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard both rank in the top seven in the National League in ERA but are not as intimidating as a year ago. And Zack Wheeler has suffered three setbacks this year in their comeback from Tommy John surgery and now appears likely to miss a second straight full season.
Collins said they had been warned by a host of baseball men, including Giants manager Bruce Bochy and Hall of Famer John Smoltz, that this could happen. By reaching the World Series, the Mets played until Nov. 1 last year.
The young starting pitchers have been hit particularly hard as their bodies have not responded this year.
What has gone wrong? Is it a real hangover from the 2015 workload? Bad luck? Both?
"That is a really legitimate question," Collins said. "When we get together with our coaching staff, we ask the same questions. I think it's a combination. I've said it before. People don't want to hear it because they think it's an excuse. We don't make excuses here. But I've had too many guys that have managed in the postseason, deep into the postseason, tell me there's a residual effect. And a lot of times it's your pitching.
"Guys have accumulated a lot of innings -- and pressure innings, not just innings. We're talking about the last two months of last season, these guys had to pitch big games every night. The side effect on the next year is your body -- not necessarily the muscles, but the adrenaline -- just beats your system up."
There's a reason beyond quirkiness that the Giants win the World Series in even years, then take a step backward the following season.
"I talked to Boch about it [Thursday] -- exactly that," Collins said. "He told me last winter, 'You're going to see some effect from this, from playing into November.' I didn't know what they meant, to be honest. And then I talked to John Smoltz. And they said the same thing.
"That's why we talked about trying to take it easy early in the spring, to build these guys up. We tried to do that. We kept them around 100 pitches for, heck, almost two months. And then said, 'OK, we can start to let them get deeper into games.' I think it's helped a little bit, but I think you're still seeing the fact that there's a residual effect of playing that deep, and we've just had some bad luck."
Syndergaard, who starts opposite Jeff Samardzija on Sunday night, has struggled to put away batters of late. Over their past six starts, they have averaged 18.8 pitches per inning. That has resulted in an average outing length of 5⅔ innings during that span.
Meanwhile, DeGrom is coming off an outing in which they gave up career highs with eight runs and 13 hits Thursday against the Giants.
The Mets initially had contemplated using Monday's day off to skip fifth starter Jonathon Niese and keep the other pitchers on standard rest. Collins has abandoned that consideration, however, because of Matz's shoulder issue and deGrom's struggles in their last start. Niese is the latest to hold the rotation spot originally occupied by Harvey. Logan Verrett went 0-3 with a 7.18 ERA in seven starts in that role before being demoted to Triple-A Las Vegas.
Despite Niese's 9.28 ERA since joining the Mets in a trade with the Pittsburgh Pirates, they will start Tuesday's all-important opener at Busch Stadium. The Mets are chasing the St. Louis Cardinals for the second wild-card spot. Matz is lined up for the third game of that series, but it's unclear if they will be healthy enough to pitch by then, which means the Mets might be forced to use rookie Seth Lugo. DeGrom starts Wednesday on extra rest, rather than Tuesday in the opener, which would have allowed the Mets to skip Niese.
"Not that Jake's hurt, but [Thursday] night may be a perfect example of their fumes are starting to run a little low," Collins said.
The Mets did enter Saturday's game with a 3.63 ERA among their starting pitchers. That still ranked third best in the majors. But they're limping to the finish line this year as the rotation's 2015 workload and injury misfortune catches up with them.
Thursday marks the 105th birthday of Taiwanese-Japanese inventor Momofuku Ando, whose instant noodles revolutionized the food world, and Google is honoring this king of quick cuisine with a new Google Doodle.
As TIME wrote back in 2006, “In 1958, Momofuku Ando, an unassuming entrepreneur living in Osaka, created the instant noodle — and a continent has been feasting on their invention ever since.”
However, the road was not easy for the founder of Nissin Food Products. Ando struggled to find the right balance and create noodles that were tasty but did not become mush when boiled. The secret, learned from their wife, was to spray the noodles with chicken soup and then fry them in tempura oil.
The instant noodle, a dietary staple for every college student from Asia to America, had come to fruition.
Ando was born during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan in 1910, moved to Japan at the age of 23 became a Japanese citizen following World War II. They died in Osaka on Jan. 5, 2007, at the age of 96.

When you're dealing in the transfer market, you are always looking for the best possible offer. Regardless if you're intention is to buy or to sell, you want to make sure you're getting the best deal possible. At this point, you really ought to take the reputation of the various leagues into consideration. Why, you ask?
That's a fairly decent transfer window, isn't it? All these players were bought cheap and sold for far more than their actual worth at the time. So besides shrewd negotiating, what's the secret ingredient here? Why does the market work the way it does? The answer to that question is fairly simple; league reputation…
I intend to show you how you can use it to your adventure when you are navigating the transfer market. It can help you get players cheap and sell them far more expensively than you had ever imagined. All you have to do is factor league reputation into the equation.
So how the hell does this work?
In order to show you what I mean, I have to give you an example of how league reputation influences transfers. Our case study here is Regivan, a Brazilian-Japanese defensive midfielder. They were brought in from Brazilian Serie B club Figueirense for €600k, which is a decent sum for any J-League side. Since the J-League's reputation is more or less on par with the Brazilian Serie B, this did little for their market value. Various loan spells and subsequent performances for Kawasaki Frontale saw their market value increase to about €1.8 million. When I decided to cash in on Regivan, I managed to get €3.3 million for him.
That's a 100% markup on their actual market value. Stuttgart had no issue paying that much for a player from the J-League, because they know their value will be reassessed as soon as the deal is completed. Stuttgart is active in the Bundesliga, which has a high reputation. This high reputation will cause the value of players active in such a league to spike, which is what happened.
The day after the transfer took place, Regivan's transfer value had increased nearly tenfold from €1.8 million to €13.5 million. The AI appears to have no trouble predicting such shifts and spikes in value and therefore has no problem with seemingly overpaying for a player. The league reputation caused a spike and since the AI anticipates them, it takes this future spike into consideration when negotiating a deal buying players.
Since the AI pulls the same stunt when it's selling players, you have to be careful when you're scouting. Players on the transfer list or with expiring contracts are ideal targets for transfers if you're looking to make a quick buck. Investing in youth players can be a costly affair, as their value can unrealistically skyrocket at times.
Just to summarise my approach in such matters…
Especially when you are active in smaller leagues, the market value of your player as determined by FM is kept low by the relatively low reputation of the league you are active in. In reality, similar players playing in the Serie A, La Liga, Premier League or Bundesliga are worth four to five times this value and if you try to sell one, you tend to pay even more for similar players, especially when they are not transfer listed. Whilst that means we can comfortably ask for more cash, it doesn't mean we just blurt out random numbers, because even the spending power of clubs like PSG or Chelsea has its limits.
You have to do some research before you determine an actual asking price. I generally do this by creating a scouting filter based on the player I am selling and seeing how other players with similar skill-sets compare to my lad. Allow me to show you.
When we create a scouting filter based on Regivan, we can see the values for similar players. As I said before, asking for more is not a bad idea since players with similar qualities are worth a whole lot more. Most of the players on this filter are of a similar age, similar position and when you look at the ones not yet active for an absolute top club in a top league, you can see that I actually made a pretty shit deal. Asking for around €12 million wouldn't have been unreasonable. This means that just doubling or tripling your asking price still constitutes a fairly good deal for interested clubs, especially since Regivan's wage at the time (and current one for that matter) was a lot lower than that of their top league counterparts.
If you are looking to sell your players, especially to foreign clubs, the league standard of the potential buyers is a crucial factor in determining a realistic asking price. It's also a factor many people tend to ignore. If you are wondering why some managers always seem to be able to negotiate good deals for their players, this specific factor might be one of the reasons.

Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill Vegas will be opening December 18, 2012, a few days before BurGR Gordon Ramsay opens at Planet Hollywood. This makes 3 Ramsay eatery's in Vegas all opening this year! The other being Gordon Ramsay Steak @ Paris of course.
Two new restaurants opening in Las Vegas in the same week, I would possibly expect Mr. Gordon Ramsay themselves to be present to promote some of this!
On to the Ramsay Pub & Grill! Opening December 18th, it will offer dinner only until mid-January, when it will then open for lunch as well. Former Sous Chef @ Ramsay's London West Hollywood, Jeremy Berlin, will be the Executive Chef of the Pub & Grill. There will be some strict standards at this pub!
The “Grill” part of the eatery will have dishes including New Zealand Red Snapper, lamb t-Bone, brick-pressed cornish chicken, Dry aged, 30-ounce bone-in beef rib eye, and many other offerings, while the “Pub” side will feature more drinks, such as 36 beers on tap! (damn.. goodluck to the servers when they are asked “What do you have on tap?”!)
December is a busy Ramsay-Vegas month! In case you're wondering, Gordon Ramsay Steak @ Paris has a long wait-list, and It's very hard to get in (difficult even to get a reservation at times!). These places are definitely going to be BUSY! Show up early, or try to get reservations so you aren't disappointed if you're looking for a Ramsay Vegas Experience!
Story highlights Delgado was arrested at a Texas restaurant
They face 20 years in prison if they are convicted
They had set up a scholarship for Latino students
A prominent Texas attorney and former university trustee faces charges of laundering more than $600 million for a Mexican drug cartel.
Marco Antonio Delgado, 46, was in court Thursday to face their charges, according to federal authorities.
The attorney, who once was a trustee at the Carnegie Mellon University, was arrested on November 2 at a restaurant in El Paso.
"Delgado is linked to a drug cartel based in Guadalajara, Mexico, and accused of conspiring to launder more than $600 million," investigators with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security Investigations said in a statement.
Delgado faces a maximum 20 year prison sentence if convicted, federal authorities said.
Delgado had been active in the local community as they were a member of the board at the El Paso Symphony Orchestra and once donated more than $20,000 to the organization.
Ruth Jacobson, executive director of the symphony, told CNN affiliate KFOX that they were "surprised and saddened" by the arrest.
Delgado also donated to Carnegie Mellon University setting up the "Marco Delgado Fellowship for the Advancement of Hispanics in Public Policy and Management ," according to the website of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania based university.
The scholarship that started in 2003 awards about $5,000 to "students who are expected to make a significant contribution to the Latino community," the website said.
Their lawyer said Delgado was innocent.
"You know, they are a brother (fellow) attorney and I'm honored to represent them and we'll go from there," lawyer Jose Montes told KFOX.
Just got dumped?
We all know the feeling: you read an article promising wonders, getting all pumped up and then…
Well, the one thing that nerds love, data, is helping to solve this social problem when it comes to getting dumped in the world of alternative currencies.
In an era of numerous altcoins, deciding which ones are a buy, sell or hold can become an arduous task for an individual. Thankfully, your life is about to become a lot easier thanks to CoinGecko.
What is CoinGecko?
CoinGecko is cryptocurrency ranking and evaluation site that breaks down quantitative and qualitative data for a number of different metrics. The metrics used include items such as Twitter followers, Reddit subscribers, coin community, the cost of a 51% attack, the number of developers working on the coin and much more to provide an overall score of the coin and a rating for each category.
You would not believe all the meticulous sorts of data that can be used to determine a coin's value. No need to do that though, CoinGecko illustrates this data in a clean user interface and nice graphs and now CoinGecko has an alpha version of their dashboard (below).
The story of CoinGecko starts with its founders, Bobby Ong and TM Lee. Bobby is a University College London Economics graduate while TM Lee is a Purdue University Computer Science graduate. At UCL, Bobby learned all about financial stability and prevention of bank runs with federal deposit insurance schemes. However, as Bobby saw with Cyprus in 2013, “the trust between government and savers can be broken when depositors are forced to take a haircut on their savings.”
This one incident got Bobby thinking about Bitcoin and how there is some sort of inherent “underlying utility to this sort of digital asset.” But after getting involved in Bitcoin, Bobby got lost in a sea of altcoins.
Bobby and TM, like a lot of people, read some articles about this and that altcoin, and they bought some coins on “gut feeling” without doing much research.
“Some purchases did well, but some did pretty bad.”
Bobby learned more about trading strategies on cryptocurrencies and found that there are “several fundamental reasons why certain altcoins may hold good value in the mid/long term. The basic idea goes along the line of technical innovation, community strength and developer team.”
Dogecoin, what a joke Bobby once thought: “Who would buy into a me-too copy with dogs.”
What Bobby failed to realize was that Dogecoin had a great community supporting it and developers working hard to see it succeed.
“I decided to dig deep into the Dogecoin community numbers and found out that they are pretty impressive. Looking at the Dogecoin subreddit and how active the community members there, I became an instant Dogecoin convert and started mining Dogecoin myself.”
Realizing what they had missed out, it came to him.
“I thought that it would be a good idea to collect all this information to rank and benchmark other cryptocurrencies.”
Bobby went to their friend, TM who had also missed out on the Dogecoin phenomena and they decided to give this idea a whirl. Since then the two have been making better trades.
“We wanted to help people make more quantitative decisions before buying cryptocurrencies and help provide a 360 degree overview by looking at a lot more metrics.”
Since CoinGecko launched in April it has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Reddit and bitcointalk forum. It was already a top post on the Dogecoin reddit thread. The interface is easy to use with information presented clearly.
There is still a lot going on for CoinGecko; they are adding new coins and metrics every week to get a more comprehensive view of each coin compared to others. Maybe they will even add live charts to make it the perfect investment tool, but hey, who knows?
A smartphone and a snorkeling mask are two of the key parts of a prototype virtual-reality headset that works underwater.
No matter how well virtual reality mimics the sights and sounds of flying, floating, or swimming, it's impossible to feel that you're really doing those things when your feet are planted firmly on solid ground. So Stephen Greenwood and Allan Evans are making a VR headset that you can wear underwater.
Greenwood, director of creative development at Discovery Digital Networks, and Evans, cofounder of headset maker Avegant, started working on it in December after talking about what it would be like to combine an isolation tank—where you float in a dark, silent room, alone—with virtual reality.
So far it's just a side project (and a silly-sounding one at that), but Greenwood and Evans can envision it being developed for entertainment, scuba-diving simulations, or physical therapy. Virtual reality is still in its infancy as a consumer product, and beyond a smattering of games, films, and applications it's still not clear how we'll use it; they see this as one option for making VR feel much more captivating than it typically does.
“I think there's a little more of a suspension of disbelief when you're in a radically different environment,” Greenwood said. “When you don't have a sense of the ground or gravity or what's up or what's down, it makes it that much more believable.”
Their underwater VR gear is nothing more than a rudimentary prototype, but it does work. The computer and display come from a waterproof Android smartphone, which is attached to a 3-D-printed block of plastic that acts as a spacer between the handset and a snorkeling mask. The mask, covered in black tape to keep light from leaking in, has two biconvex lenses—like the ones you'd find in the simple, handheld Google Cardboard—glued to the inside. A plain old snorkel lets you breathe, and audio comes from a Finis underwater MP3 player that uses bone conduction to transmit sound.
They've been trying it out at Greenwood's apartment building, which has a pool (a rarity in San Francisco). On a sunny, chilly afternoon this month, I jumped in and tried it out myself.
The first experience had me floating above the International Space Station while David Bowie's “Space Oddity” played on a loop. I found that I didn't want to do much moving; it was relaxing to just hang, suspended in the water (though the visuals made it feel more like outer space), occasionally twisting around to see what was behind, above, or below.
After I'd spent some time checking out the ISS—minutes, probably, but it was hard to tell how much time passed—Greenwood switched to another VR experience that was a little closer to my reality: an underwater scene with colorful fish, peppy jazz music playing in the background. Hanging out with the fish was a little more fun, despite the fact that water started seeping into the snorkel mask as I swam in circles to investigate the world around me.
I quickly realized that the headset is about as advanced as Google Cardboard at this point. There's head orientation tracking, but no tracking of your head's position in space. This means you can turn around to look at different things, but your view of the virtual world through the goggles doesn't change as you swim around.
This is especially weird if you're making an effort to swim in one direction, as I did while checking out the fish, because the visuals make you feel as if you're not actually moving even as your arms and legs are flailing. And it means you have no way to know if you're about to smack into the side of the pool (Greenwood served as my spotter from the pool deck, but every time I touched the rough walls of the pool the spell was momentarily broken).
In hopes of improving this, Greenwood said, they and Evans are working on building a positional tracking system that communicates with the phone in the headset and can work underwater; lights and cameras, which can be used on terra firma, don't work so well in that setting. They won't give specifics beyond saying it involves sound and magnetics to calculate depth.
Despite the simplicity of the setup, however, it was easy to forget about the outside world and just enjoy the weird virtual one below the surface. I didn't stay down there too long—the day was ending and the pool was getting cold—but I'd like to go back soon.
Journey to real-time
To quickly recap, Blomkamp set up Oats Studios in Vancouver after already making a number of complex visual effects-heavy studio feature films (District 9, Elysium, and Chappie). Oats are designed to go back to the director's roots in shorts and explore new ways of testing out content and connecting with audiences. The shorts were shared online, as were some direct assets from the productions.
Even though they were experimental, the films still followed a largely typical production life cycle, from pre-production through to post. CG and visual effects were important aspects of most of the shorts, which meant Oats had employed the use of motion capture, photogrammetry, intricate modeling and rigging, and various rendering techniques into its pipeline.
Then, at one point, Unity Technologies – the makers of the Unity game engine – approached Blomkamp with the idea of applying the experimental side of Oats to a short film rendered in real-time. Unity had already done that with a 2016 tech demo of its own, called Adam, which had effectively been released as a short film itself. Unity's intention was to highlight the physically plausible qualities of the game engine and its capabilities as a filmmaking tool.
Oats took on the Adam assets, and developed additional ones, to make Adam: Episode 2 with Unity. “This was a whole new experience for us to try, and a learning curve as well,” said Harvey. “One of the big questions was, how will we adapt as a traditional filmmaking company to using something like Unity? Much to our joy and surprise, it was not nearly as painful as I was worried about. It was actually quite seamless to be able to move into something like this.”
Adam: Episode 2 was actually made largely like Oats' other shorts. Assets were modeled, rigged, textured, and animated in traditional cg tools. Action was also captured via performance capture, including facial capture. Unity's Timeline sequencing tool also enabled the management and editing together of scenes.
For Harvey, the benefit of working in real-time was obvious. The filmmakers could get relatively instant feedback on shots – remember, there's no need for a renderfarm in real-time, which means many iterations could be made. “Literally, the film just existed live at all times,” they said. “Any time we added something new, it was there and all done, at any time. You could turn the camera around, you could move a light, you could add an object. Whatever you wanted to do, it was just always running, which was really, really cool.”
“At one point,” adds Harvey, “I was getting worried about a certain asset in this new film. I think it was [the female character's] mask that was re-developed. We were changing the way it looked, because at one point, it covered more of their face and you couldn't see them emotion. We wanted to remove it and make the whole thing glass. And I'm like, ‘We really need to get this in, because we've got to get it into the shots. We need to see what it starts looking like.' I was thinking about how I used to do things, where you'd put it in the shots, and maybe a week later I'd get to see it. But here, a couple hours later, I was at a different artist's desk, looking at where we were putting rocks, and their mask was in all of the shots! It was a head trip, because it was just like, ‘Oh, it's there live all the time – always.'”
Adding digital humans to the mix
The production side of real-time was an obvious benefit to the filmmaking process for Oats. But could a real-time engine produce imagery that was high quality enough to enable believable, digital humans? Adam: Episode 3 set out to deliver exactly that. Animating the humans in the short was informed by body and facial capture, while the main approach to making them photoreal lay in scanning actors for reference and using Unity's shaders for sub-surface scattering (the phenomenon in which light penetrates the surface of the skin, interacts with it, and then bounces out).
Sub-surface scattering in traditional offline renderers is key to some of the more believable digital humans made in big Hollywood productions. While it has certainly been tackled in some real-time projects previously, including with other game engines, this was one of the first times it had been attempted at such a large scale with Unity. Harvey says that, in some ways, Oats ignored the fact that they were using a game engine at all, and tried to solve the digital human problem as if they were making a typical film. For example, they utilized the Alembic format (common in many visual effects projects) for streaming cloth and facial animation.
“When we went into it,” said Harvey, “we didn't look at what's been done and say, ‘Well, how can we make it better?' We came into it thinking, ‘Where would we want this to look if we were making it in a regular film?' We're not going to think about it like we're restricted by a game engine; we're going to try to make it look as good as we can make it look, just like we would with any other tool. And because of that, we're going to try to approach it the same way.”
Still, there were limitations inherent in relying on a real-time engine to produce something so complicated. So, wanting to have the film be able to run at 30 frames per second in real-time, Oats did have to make some concessions. “We could've set it to render one frame a second, but we said we want to do 30 frames a second,” said Harvey. “By putting that artificial limit on ourselves, that, in turn, set the technical limits within the engine. Our faces could only be a certain resolution if we wanted them to stream at that speed. The cloth could only be a certain resolution. Even though we had the capability of making it higher resolution, we had a technical roadblock that it just couldn't keep up at 30 frames per second.”
Accessible filmmaking
While Oats Studios might have the clout of someone like Blomkamp behind it and the expertise and experience of many cg and visual effects artists like Harvey, the real-time films they've now made also evidence the fact that a new kind of filmmaking is possible. Unity is free for beginners, students, and hobbyists, with Adam assets also available to download and use. The version of Unity used by Oats is the same one available to the world (in fact, Oats used an older version than the current release).
Harvey recalls Blomkamp themselves being stunned at what filmmaking tools are now commonplace, compared to what they had when getting into the industry. “Neill's talked a lot about this. He's like, ‘Man, when I was trying to get into film, if only I had had these tools.' You had to go buy a pretty expensive camera, and run around and film it. Now, you can just start making stuff. I think you'll see a lot more people being able to tell stories, and those stories are going to be coming from all over the place.”

For what reasons can states legitimately go to war? The most obvious one is self-defense—when one's country is attacked by foreign forces, whether by organized armies or by non-state terrorist organizations. Further, international law and common morality provide for the right of collective self-defense: when a state's allies are threatened by foreign military attack but they are not capable of defending against such attacks on their own.
Second, in certain circumstances—rare, to be sure—military intervention may be justifiable for moral or humanitarian reasons: when the lives of other peoples are massively threatened by forces within their own country, whether by their own governments or by internal groups. To be sure, the record of humanitarian interventions counsels extreme caution; witness the after-effects of the NATO intervention in Libya. However, sometimes they work—witness the belated protection of Bosnians from Serbian massacres in the 1990s. In any case the principle cannot be abandoned.
Third, in even rarer circumstances, it may be justifiable or even necessary for states to go to war to protect against non-military but still massive threats to their economies or to their societies and national values. For example, during the 1970s when the health of the U.S. economy was still heavily dependent on importing oil from the Middle East—it no longer is—there would at least have been a case for U.S. military intervention if those oil imports were threatened, whether by boycotts or by military or terrorist attacks.
For all three of those reasons, a large-scale European ground intervention against the Islamic State in Syria, Iraq and possibly in Afghanistan would be justifiable and increasingly necessary: the self-defense and European collective self-defense case is obvious, the moral case for destroying the Islamic State and starting the process of restoring the human rights of the peoples of Syria, Iraq and perhaps Afghanistan is a very powerful one, and it is at least arguable that continuing massive refugee inflows into Western Europe could impose very high economic and societal costs, if not yet, then perhaps soon.
On the other hand, none of those reasons justifies U.S. military intervention—and by that I mean not only “boots on the ground,” but even the growing U.S. air and special forces interventions in the Middle East. First, unlike the 9/11 attacks, in the last fifteen years no terrorist attacks against the United States have been on a scale to justify going to war in the Middle East. On the contrary, it is precisely the growing U.S. military intervention—or re-intervention—in Iraq and Syria that is likely to provide the incentives for massive terrorist attacks on our homeland. Thus, our national security is not enhanced but in fact is threatened by our military interventions in the Middle East.
What about the case for U.S. participation in a European military intervention for reasons of collective self-defense? The principle of collective self-defense only makes sense when one's allies are too weak to protect themselves, which hardly applies to our NATO allies . Should the terrorist attacks against them continue and air strikes against ISIL fail, surely at some point they will be forced to send ground troops into the Middle East. France alone has a modern standing army of some 200,000 troops, and could raise hundreds of thousands more if necessary—not least, in all likelihood, from the refugees volunteering to liberate their homelands from ISIL's barbarism.
The other legitimate reasons for going to war also do not apply to the United States—at least with equal force as they do to Europe. Obviously there will not be an inflow of Middle Eastern refugees so massive as to threaten the U.S. economy, let alone its society. That leaves the moral issue, which cannot be so easily dismissed. Still, it applies with greater force to the powerful states in the Islamic State's neighborhood: to other Middle Eastern states as well as to Europe.
Put differently, even when there are legitimate moral issues, there cannot be a duty for the United States to go to war simply because other powerful states fail to perform their moral duties. As in the case of national security, there should be no moral “free riders.” Or, in the old but even more relevant cliché: the U.S. neither can nor should be the police officer of the world.
There would be no way for the Islamic state to resist a major and entirely legitimate European military invasion, and absolutely no need for the U.S. to participate in it, whether on grounds of national security or morality.

Online shopping and in-store big box shopping alike are made possible by legions of warehouse workers, typically paid around $10 an hour or less, often working not for the big-name retailers they supply but for a complex web of subcontractors and temp agencies, and facing high turnover, low job security and injuries. But warehouse workers around the country are organizing and fighting back. Organizing doesn't always, or even usually, mean organizing into a union—the barriers to that are often too high. But workers are filing lawsuits and pushing the government to investigate unsafe working conditions, wage theft and more, and using protest and the media to draw attention to problems at well-known companies.
For instance, after months of scrutiny and protest drawing attention to reports of Amazon warehouses at which ambulances were kept stationed outside to treat workers inevitably collapsing from the summer heat, Amazon announced it is spending $52 million to air-condition its warehouses. Workers in those warehouses will still be worked unreasonably hard for unreasonably little money with poor job security, but air-conditioning should substantially reduce one hazard.
One set of warehouse workers is trying to join a union, though, strengthened by the fact that they are actually employed by a retailer and not by temp agencies. The overwhelmingly Latino workforce at a New Jersey Bed Bath & Beyond distribution center is moving toward a union representation vote:
Betania Valdez, who started work in the warehouse in 2008, a year after it opened, said workers sought out the UFCW to address low wages, favoritism in raises, rampant safety issues, and unaffordable and unattainable health care. [...] In the New Jersey warehouse, Bed Bath and Beyond new hires start a quarter above minimum wage, at $7.50 an hour. After four years Valdez has seen their wage creep up to $8.87. She's angry that they have no health insurance and just three paid sick days a year, as they and others struggle with respiratory problems they link to the perpetually dusty warehouse.
If the workers are successful, this would be the first unionized Bed Bath & Beyond facility as well as being a high-profile victory for workers in the warehousing industry more generally. Bed Bath & Beyond is carrying out an aggressive anti-union campaign within the warehouse.

When Wind Turbine Engineers Face Shipping Problems
Engineers are a practical thinking bunch. When they encounter a problem, they think of it as a challenge that has to be solved by utilizing the mighty forces of applied science.
The engineers that make up the management of the leading German wind turbine manufacturer Enercon encountered such a challange a few years ago. Every time they had to ship wind turbine parts across the oceans to provide their customers with clean energy solutions, they faced the problem of standardized cargo units not matching the dimensions of their products at all. This meant that they had to pay for significantly more cargo space than what was actually required for their wind turbine parts. On top of that, fossil fuel prices are rising continuously, an unstoppable trend that will increase transportation costs for all shipping for the decades to come.
However, transportation costs are a part of the entire profitability calculation of any project. Thereby, they also play a significant role in the decision-making process of investors when investors choose a suitable wind turbine for their project. German medium-sized businesses are known for their global export orientation, their long-term business strategies, and their obsession to control as many portions of the value chain as possible. With this mindset, the solution to the “challenge” described above was obvious — in order to make Enercon wind turbines more competitive around the globe, they had to construct and operate their own cargo ships.
Discarded 20th-Century Engineering Marvels
Every child knows that humankind has sailed across the seven seas with 100% wind-powered ships for centuries. So it's a no-brainer that a wind turbine maker developing their own cargo ship would want to utilize wind power as a means of propulsion somehow. The engineering challenge was to find a way to adapt the age-old concept of sailing to the requirements of 21st-century cargo shipping. In a nutshell: a modern sailing vessel has to be reliable, it can't be manpower intensive, and it has to be superior in a meaningful way.
To solve this problem, the Enercon engineers embraced the concept of “rotor-ships” developed by the German engineer and inventor Anton Flettner during the early 1920s. Flettner utilized the “Magnus effect” to design an unconventional concept of propulsion for a sailing ship. The “Magnus effect” is the phenomenon whereby a spinning object flying in a fluid creates a whirlpool of fluid around itself, and experiences a force perpendicular to the line of motion. In the case of the rotor-ships, the spinning objects are huge metal cylinders and the “fluid” is the wind. The resulting force was utilized to produce propulsion for the ships.
In 1924, the first experimental rotor-ship was built. In February 1925, the “Buckau” made its maiden voyage from Danzig in modern-day Poland across the North Sea to Scotland. The two “Flettner rotors” of the ground-breaking vessel operated without problems even in the stormiest weather conditions and were significantly more efficient than traditional sails.
One year later, Flettner's rotor-ship crossed the Atlantic sailing to the US via South America. When it arrived in New York, it was quite a sensation and the rotor-ship proved to be a technological success. A few months later, a second ship was built with “Flettner-Rotors”. This time, it was a 90-meter-long cargo ship called “Barbara”. It underwent trials in the Mediterranean by the navy of Weimar Germany, where it received positive reviews and operated without problems. According to the ship's captain, the 3 Flettner-Rotors of the cargo vessel generated up to 600 hp of additional power and could be used 30-40% of the time during their journeys. Considering that the ship's conventional engine had 1,100 hp, that's a 54% boost! (source of the photo)
Despite receiving such positive reviews and being an absolute technological success, the idea of “unconventional sailing” was no commercial success and the concept was deemed inefficient compared to conventional fossil-fuel-powered naval vessels. The “rotor-ship” disappeared from the seas in 1933 and Anton Flettner turned their attention to other projects. They would later become a pioneer in aviation engineering and develop the first helicopter ready for serial production, the Fl-282 Kolibri (Hummingbird) built in 1942 for the German military during World War II.
80 Years Later — A New Beginning, E-Shop 1
More than 80 years after the first rotor-ships successfully set “sail” to travel across the oceans, the paradigms of efficiency have changed. Energy efficency and sustainability are the new benchmarks that increasingly define our understanding of how things have to fulfill their purpose in order to be called efficient. With these benchmarks guiding their design process, Enercon built the first commercial rotor-ship of the 21st century, the “E-Ship 1”.
Having more than 20 years of experience in wind power engineering, Enercon designed an aerodynamic hull, a new and efficient propeller for the conventional diesel-electric propulsion, modern Flettner-rotors with automatic control systems, and a special over-sized steering rudder that is required to convert the trajectory of the “sails” into the desired forward motion.
Energy efficiency being the guiding principle of the ship's design, the exhaust fumes of the diesel engines that power the two propellers of the main propulsion don't go to waste. The hot exhaust fumes power a modern Siemens steam turbine that generates additional electricity. That electricity is used to spin the four Flettner-Rotors, each being 27 meters high and having a diameter of 4 meters. This modern motor sailor design reduces the fuel consumption of this 123-meter-long cargo ship by up to 30-40%.
The ship made its first voyage with cargo in August 2010, carrying nine turbines for Castledockrell Wind Farm from Emden to Dublin, Ireland. Today, it regularly ships wind turbines around the world. According to a ship-tracking website, E-Ship 1 just left the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of Africa a few days ago.
One more fun fact: this is the first ship to utilize excess heat of the engines to cool the interior of the ship — just a little extra, in case saving 40% on increasingly expensive gas isn't enough to set new standards.
The E-Ship 1 — 21st-century sailing at it's best!

Fox News contributor Dr. Keith Ablow told a Tea Party rally that they're like "slaves" who have become "enslaved by the notion of ever-increasing taxes," health care reform, and gun laws. Ablow told the crowd that those grievances "can't stand, because slaves always revolt."
Ablow spoke at an April 13 Tax Day Tea Party Rally in Boston. In a video of the speech posted to YouTube, Ablow, who was billed as a "FOX NEWS expert on psychiatry," attacked President Obama as someone who is psychologically damaged because they were "abandoned" as a child (a frequent critique by Ablow).
Near the end of their remarks, Ablow invoked slavery:
ABLOW: Dependency on anything, a drug or the government, does not last. It can't last because deep in our souls, we know that only independence works. Not far from here, my mentor, Ted Nadelson, once told me, "You know, the thing with slaves is you can't keep them, they always revolt." And that's what's going to happen here. Enslaved by the notion of ever-increasing taxes; told that we can't spend our money, even the money we do take home, the way we want to; told that adulthood starts at 25 [a reference to the Affordable Care Act allowing dependents to stay insured until age 26], if ever; told that nobody really should be able to hold a firearm and know that they can, or she, can defend their family or their family, if push comes to shove. That can't stand, because slaves always revolt.
Ablow has a long history of launching incendiary attacks against progressives and dispensing "pop-psychology nonsense" as a member of Fox's purported "Medical A-Team." Ablow once blamed the rise of conspiracies about President Obama's birth certificate on Obama supposedly "sever[ing] themselves from all core emotion." Following the 2012 vice presidential debate, Ablow claimed that Vice President Joe Biden may be suffering from dementia. And Ablow regularly launches anti-LGBT attacks that, in the words of an American Psychiatric Association fellow, "have little basis in current clinical practices."
As Media Matters has documented, conservative media figures have routinely attacked progressives and the Obama administration for promoting policies that supposedly enslave Americans.

In some cases, the media queries that we choose to set have nothing to do with which devices we target. Some media queries are rather set depending on properties of the design.
In a previous post, we talked about how it is possible to use LESS to easily build a responsive stylesheet, but we left it at simple cases where the targeted devices govern the sizes for which responsive styles are set. Now that may seem like the obvious thing to do; after all, why should anything else than the device's size influence the way styles are coded? I mean, when you decide to support iPads, you target a screen size of 1024 X 768 and 768 X 1024, right?
Fixed-width grid
Using back our example, we had a grid of thumbnails centered in a container, whose width depended on how many thumbnails wide it was possible to fit inside the container. The grid was constrained inside a parent element. We'll use this same example, but instead of constraining the grid, we'll put it at the root level of the body, so its only constrain will be the screen width.
Here is a typical markup:
<body> <div class="thumbnailWrapper"> <div class="thumbnailContainer"> <div class="thumbnail"> </div> <div class="thumbnail"> </div> <div class="thumbnail"> </div> <div class="thumbnail"> </div> <div class="thumbnail"> </div> <div class="thumbnail"> </div> <div class="thumbnail"> </div> <div class="thumbnail"> </div> <div class="thumbnail"> </div> <div class="thumbnail"> </div> <div class="thumbnail"> </div> </div> </div> </body>
As you know, it's quite easy to center an element in a page : just set its side margins to auto. But in order for that to work, the element must also have a fixed width. In our case, the width of the container depends on how many columns of thumbnails we wish to display : its width has to be the total width of its columns. Let's do that, assuming that we want to display 4 columns of thumbnails:
@thumbSize : 150px; @thumbGutter : 8px; @thumbRealW : @thumbSize + @thumbGutter; .thumbnailWrapper{ margin: @gutter auto; background-color: #ffa; .clearfix(); width: (@thumbRealW * 4) - @thumbGutter; .thumbnailContainer{ margin-left: -@thumbGutter; width: @thumbRealW * 4; } } .thumbnail{ width: @thumbSize; height: @thumbSize; float:left; .border-radius(50%); margin:0 0 @gutter @thumbGutter; background-color: #aac; }
A responsive grid that depends on preset media queries
Simple with less, as we don't have to hardcode the total width of columns. We can calculate it!
To make that grid responsive, we would just need to leave the width of the containers undefined until they are set inside media queries, so as to adapt to each screen size. But in order to do that, we would need to calculate the number of columns that fit inside the screen size, for each media query that we set. That is precisely what we did in our previous post about responsive css. Just pass the available width to a mixin that will calculate the number of thumnbails that fit in it.
@media (min-width: 1200px) { #responsiveThumbnails > .set(1200px); } //other media queries... #responsiveThumbnails{ .set(@availableW) { @maxThumbsWide : floor((@availableW + @thumbGutter) / @thumbRealW); @calculatedW : @maxThumbsWide * @thumbRealW; .thumbnailWrapper{ width:@calculatedW - @thumbGutter; .thumbnailContainer{ width:@calculatedW ; } } } }
Doing it the other way around
As you may have already noticed, the width of the container can exist only as multiples of the thumbnail's width. There is no container that will ever be 3.5 thumbnails wide, it will always be 1, 2, 3, 4... thumbnails wide. These exact widths are intrinsic to the thumbnail's grid, and don't depend on anything else. In other words, the number of thumbnails that fit in a screen depend on the screen width, but the width of the container in turn solely depends on the thumbnail width.
What that means is that we have a list of breakpoints for our grid, that is predetermined and does not depend on popular screen sizes. Even if an iPad is 1024px wide, if a thumbnail is 210px wide, only 4 thumnbails fit in an iPad, so the container will have a width of 840px. We won't bother creating a media query for 1024px, we will create one for the width of 4 thumnbails, which is 840px, and then one for 5 thumbnails, but also one for 3, and so on.
@media (max-width: 419px){ //one thumnbail wide grid } @media (max-width: 629px ) and (min-width: 420px){ //two thumnbails wide grid } @media (max-width: 630px ) and (min-width: 839px){ //three thumnbails wide grid } //etc.
As you can see from the example above, that may make up a lot of media queries, and we need to manually set them depending on our basic thumbnail width. If it changes, we will need to manually change the media queries as well... a tedious task that a computer should be able to do.
The good news is, it is possible to have fewer variables in media queries conditions, so we could have less compute it inside a loop, and thus set all the media queries that we need for a given thumbnail size. Let's do it!
Loops in less
There is no built-in syntax to make a loop in less, but it is nonetheless possible to make one through the use of recursion. We'll just call a mixin that will call itself. As you may recall, less uses guards instead of ifs for conditions, so we'll just have a second mixin that will have guard to exit the loop. It looks like that, this one with 12 iterations :
#responsiveThumbnails > .setMedia(12); #responsiveThumbnails{ .setMedia(@i) when (@i > 1){ //do stuff //calls itself, decrementing the variable #responsiveThumbnails > .setMedia(@i - 1); } .setMedia(@i) when (@i = 1) { //this one ends the loop } }
In our case, we need three types of media queries :
when the screen is larger than some value, for our largest grid
when the screen width is between two values
when the screen width is smaller than some value, to have our single column design
That means that we'll need three mixins, one for each of these cases. The first one will adress our largest-case scenario, and will then call the second one. The second one will manage all the possible sizes in between, down to the width of two columns. The final one will adress the case when there's only one thumbnail fitting in the screen, and will stop the loop. We will differentiate our first mixin by giving it a different name (with an s appended) and it will be our entry point for the loop. We will pass the largest number of thumnbails we wish to accomodate, and will set it to a reasonable number. There is no need to plan for 10000px wide screens... Here it is, without any media queries yet:
#responsiveThumbnails > .setMedias(12); #responsiveThumbnails{ .setMedias(@i) { //do stuff //calls the in-between mixin, decrementing the variable #responsiveThumbnails > .setMedia(@i - 1); } .setMedia(@i) when (@i > 1){ //do stuff //calls itself, decrementing the variable #responsiveThumbnails > .setMedia(@i - 1); } .setMedia(@i) when (@i = 1) { //this one ends the loop } }
Calculating the widths
The three mixins used in our loop will only set media queries. They won't set directly the width of the container. For that, we will use the mixin we already created, and that still does the job. Even if it could use an already-calculated number for the width, we will leave it as it was before, as it can also be used in contexts when the width passed to it is not a multiple of our thumnbail width. Better have more flexible code.
.set(@availableW) { @maxThumbsWide : floor((@availableW + @thumbGutter) / @thumbRealW); @calculatedW : @maxThumbsWide * @thumbRealW; .thumbnailWrapper{ width:@calculatedW - @thumbGutter; .thumbnailContainer{ width:@calculatedW ; } } }
Now is time to calculate the breakpoints for our media queries. The first mixin is easy, as it is when the screen accomodates at least our largest number of thumnbails. It is therefore our initial increment multiplied with the width of a thumbnail. When we have our number, we will simply create a media query with it, and inside call our dimension setting mixin from above:
.setMedias(@i) { body{ @minW : (@i * @thumbRealW); @media (min-width: @minW){ #responsiveThumbnails > .set(@minW); } } #responsiveThumbnails > .setMedia(@i - 1); }
Our middle-loop mixin has to have a lower and upper limit for its media queries. The lower limit will be the minimal screen dimension that is needed to accomodate for a given number (@i) of thumnbails. The upper limit will be the dimension at which one more thumbnail fits in, minus one pixel.
.setMedia(@i) when (@i > 1) { body{ @minW : (@i * @thumbRealW); @maxW : (((@i + 1) * @thumbRealW) - 1); @media (max-width: @maxW ) and (min-width: @minW){ #responsiveThumbnails > .set(@minW); } } #responsiveThumbnails > .setMedia(@i - 1); }
And finally, our last mixin, the one that will end the loop, will address the case when only one thumbnail, but not two, fits in our screen width.
.setMedia(@i) when (@i = 1) { body{ @maxW : ((2 * @thumbRealW) - 1); @media (max-width: @maxW ){ #responsiveThumbnails > .set(@thumbRealW); } } }
A word about scope
Note that, in the mixins above, the variables and thus the media queries are wrapped inside body elements. The reason is that mixins do not create scope, as absurd as it may seem (to me anyway). Less manual says that "this is contentious", to quote them, so that behavior might change in future versions, but for now we must deal with it. If we don't scope our variables, they will be global and there will be only one value for each, no matter how many loop iterations are performed.
The only way we had to create a scope for our variables was to wrap them in a selector, body{...} in this case. It may seem counter-intuitive to have @media queries inside selectors, but it works thanks to another nice feature of less, namely nested media queries. They were designed to be used in cases that are not the problem we are facing now, but their syntax permits media queries to be nested inside selectors. That feature makes it possible to force a scope inside our mixins and at the same time have media queries in them.
The code

EDIT

Traditionally, treatment for severe second-degree burns consists of adding insult to injury: cutting a swath of skin from another site on the same patient in order to graft it over the burn. The process works, but causes more pain for the burn victim and doubles the area in need of healing. Now a relatively new technology has the potential to heal burns in a way that's much less invasive than skin grafts. With just a small skin biopsy and a ready-made kit, surgeons can create a suspension of the skin's basal cells–the stem cells of the epidermis–and spray the solution directly onto the burn with results comparable to those from skin grafts.
Spray-on skin: In a unique treatment for second-degree burns, surgeons harvest a small number of skin cells through a skin biopsy, suspend them in solution, and then spray the resulting mixture onto a burn wound. Once in place, skin stem cells, called basal cells, proliferate to create a new layer of skin.
The cell spray is intended to treat severe second-degree burns, in which the top two layers of skin are damaged but the subcutaneous tissue is left intact. Third-degree burns, which are more severe, still require a skin graft. The spray, already approved for use in some countries, has garnered interest from the United States Army, whose Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine is funding a trial, slated to begin before the end of this year, of more than 100 patients.
The technology, developed by Australian surgeon Fiona Wood, relies on cells, such as skin progenitor cells and the color-imparting melanocytes, that are most concentrated at the junction between the skin's top two layers. With a small step-by-step kit dubbed ReCell, surgeons can harvest, process and apply these cells to treat a burn as large as 50 square inches. The kit, marketed by Avita Medical, a United Kingdom-based regenerative-medicine company, is a tiny, self-contained lab about the size and shape of a large sunglasses case.
After removing a small swatch of skin near the burn site (the closer the biopsy, the better for precise matching of color and texture), the surgeon places it in the kit's tiny incubator along with an enzyme solution. The enzyme loosens the critical cells at the skin's dermal-epidermal junction, and the surgeon harvests them by scraping them off the epidermal and dermal layers and suspending them in solution. The resulting mixture is then sprayed onto the wound, repopulating the burn site with basal cells from the biopsy site.
“Currently, treating any burn that requires a skin graft is the same technology we were routinely using 30 years ago,” says James Holmes, a surgeon and the medical director of the Burn Center at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. Current practice with larger burns requires grafts from donor skin that are anywhere from one-quarter to the complete size of the burn area. ReCell requires only as much as four square centimeters. “This allows you to take a very small skin biopsy and process it at the table there in the operating room using a fully prepackaged device,” Holmes says. “You're able to cover an area that's 80 times the size of your biopsy.”
Holmes is the lead investigator on an upcoming multicenter trial that will compare skin grafts and ReCell. Patients in the trial will act as their own controls: If a burn victim has a second-degree burn severe enough for surgeons to deem treatable by skin graft, half of the burn will be treated that way, while the other half will be treated with the cell spray.
Lab in a box: The ReCell kit, hardly bigger than a designer sunglasses case, houses a miniature lab for harvesting skin basal cells.
Not everyone agrees that second-degree burns require grafts or other treatments to heal. “Most burns heal without a skin graft. They mostly heal with a Band-Aid,” says Robert Sheridan, a surgeon at the Shriners Burn Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. “There's a long history of autologous [derived from the patient] products for burn treatment, and they all suffer from high costs or neutral results.” The upcoming U.S. study won't compare ReCell against no treatment, so this issue is unlikely to be resolved soon.
As a complete replacement for skin grafts, ReCell only works against severe second-degree burns–deeper, third-degree burns have destroyed the layer of skin that the ReCell solution would be able to repopulate. But the spray may be useful in treating more severe burns in conjunction with other approaches, as well as for treating existing scars. Wood, director of the burns unit at Royal Perth Hospital, uses ReCell in a process called scar remodeling, in which the cell spray helps repopulate scarred skin with melanocytes so that it more closely matches the patient's original skin tone. They also use it in combination with other treatments, such as the skin-growing scaffold Integra, to reduce scarring and improve healing time.
“I use this technology in combination with all the other traditional technologies, and I can improve the outcome and the speed of healing,” says Wood, who is also co-founder of the McCombs Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to burn research and scarless healing. Royal Perth Hospital once had a long waiting list of patients for reconstruction surgery to fix the deep scars that accompanied third-degree burns. Now, they say, no waiting list exists. “Our reconstruction rates are going down because people don't need it. Because we're doing more at the beginning, they don't need the secondary scar work.”
Can we stop pretending there is only ONE reasonable explanation for the tragic suicides of LGBT-identifying religious youth?
“We need to be able to hear and express [a question or idea] without the instant commencement of political warfare, without superimposing particular causes and constituencies over the narrative, as if every new development and every next death were a bludgeon to be wielded.” – Frank Bruni after Dallas shootings, “Divided by Race, United by Pain,” New York Times, July 8, 2016
[Formerly titled: Seven days and 460K+ Views Later, a Question for Tyler Glenn: Did Your Message Make Things Easier (Or Harder) for LGBT-Identifying Youth in the LDS Church?]
The death of one person by suicide is a heart-breaking, shattering outcome – young or old, and no matter the details. On that, singer Tyler Glenn and apostle Russell Nelson (alongside most human beings living outside of terrorist cells) are in perfect alignment.
Where we colorful human beings diverge is where exactly these suicides are coming from – and what kind of conversation will actually, practically, measurably reduce their heart-wrenching numbers.
Despite entreaties by academics, activists and mental health professionals to follow certain precautions in speaking of suicide…it has remained far too easy for every next death to become an occasion for venting our personal anguish and outrage.
There's nothing wrong with indignation, of course – which can be a powerful teacher and indicator of what needs to change. And on that level, I certainly don't fault anyone for speaking out with passion – Tyler included. Like me, they are simply trying to make the situation better.
On another level, though, I join those (including LGBT leaders I know) who are concerned that the current public conversation about youth suicide has inadvertently become an incubator for the very despair, angst and ideation we're all hoping to alleviate.
For instance, one week ago, Tyler, your public message included a pointed warning to LDS Church leaders that “there is blood of your members on your hands” – insinuating that “how many more” suicides take place was largely dependent on these leaders themselves.
Your followers subsequently echoed and elaborated your sentiments in a thousand directions online:
“Russell Nelson, there blood is on your hands”
“These leaders are monsters. I am very upset for you!…I hope you left church! I feel ashamed because I was a Mormon member too.”
“The LDS church is responsible for creating a culture where…minorities are ‘welcome' but action dictates that they are not. The LDS church kills.”
Nearly half a million views and thousands of comments later, my question for Tyler (and others making similar declarations) is simply this: Have your messages made LGBT-identifying teens within the LDS community better off? Farther from suicide? And clearly in a safer, more stable place?
I know you think you have done just that…otherwise you wouldn't be so passionately sharing your thoughts.
But as I imagine the thousands (and tens of thousands) of youth listening in to your message, in particular, I can't help but offer another perspective on what you said last week. Please understand that I share this for the same reason you and others have been sharing: in hopes of helping make the problem better.
Your concern about these youth feeling like they do not belong is, I think, a starting point that we all might be united on as a likely factor in the despair of LGBT-identifying Mormon youth. How exactly that feeling of not belonging arises is where we diverge.
For me, the most powerful part of your video, Tyler, was when you recounted teaching people about the plan of happiness as a missionary, before adding with pained emotion, “this plan has no space for me…”
My next question, Tyler, is: how did you reach that conclusion?
Did an LDS bishop sit you down and teach you that there is no space for you in this plan?
Have you ever heard this taught by your parents, or mission president or the prophets themselves?
I know that the LDS policy change has been interpreted as a clear signal of No Space by many, but let me ask again: Have you ever heard any Mormon leader teach this interpretation of the policy – namely, that it means there is no space in the plan for those who identify as LGBT/SSA?
We all know that none of these things are being taught anywhere in our faith community.
If you (or anyone else) have reached a conclusion of No Space, it cannot have been from the teaching of Church leaders. Anyone who knows these leaders appreciates how eager they would be to teach anyone exactly the reverse – namely, their conviction that the pathway to exaltation is open to all who are willing to give their hearts and lives to Christ.
Period.
That is the fundamental message we both shared on our missions – and the same message that (all) children and teenagers grow up hearing in the Church of Jesus Christ. For this youth, the divine possibilities associated with eternal identity as children of Heavenly Parents are a vivid and salient part of their lives – and a foundation for future hopes and dreams until…
Well, until they get convinced that it doesn't apply to them, right? Until someone persuades them that, in fact, this plan of happiness being taught doesn't actually work for them – and they don't actually belong after all.
Last year, a youth in our world publicly declared that they were gay. That same weekend, after years of being loved, guided, taught and relished by our ward community…he stopped attending Church entirely.
They seemed to take for granted that they simply couldn't be a part of our ward anymore. And couldn't remain Mormon.
Once again, I have to ask: who is responsible for persuading LGBT-identifying Mormon youth that they don't belong in their faith community any more? Who is convincing them that their experience of same-sex attraction is more fundamental to who they are than many other things they used to believe?
With all due respect, Tyler, from the place many of us stand, it is messages like yours (and thousands of similar messages) that are responsible. Indeed, by this point, we've seen tens of thousands of members persuaded that the doctrine and leaders they once relished are (in truth) disappointingly exclusive and merely “hetero-normative.”
Rest assured, I do not question your motives. I honestly don't. I know too many others who feel the same way as you, and I can't deny that they are are simply speaking in hopes of seeing improvement in a community they love. I also understand that from the place you stand, Church teaching and policy does not leave a open path to everyone (as many of us still believe), but instead, signals cruelly to LGBT-identifying youth that “gay children do not belong in the plan.”
If I believed that, I would be angry too. But my main point here is that thoughtful, good-hearted members (and former members) simply don't see eye to eye on any of this – from identity, sexuality, and the body to mental health, happiness and God…and lots of other things too. [Including, in this case, simply what it means to have “space in the plan” or to feel “welcome in the Church” – e.g., does it mean expanding the covenant pathway to include loving, committed gay relationships or that someone with same-sex attraction can still follow the covenant pathway as currently taught? Thoughtful people really do see that differently. Thanks Megan Matthews Allen for helping me see that oversight!]
While those disagreements may seem obvious enough, I make a point of this because an acknowledgement of reasonable disagreement is hardly ever made in all these post-suicide calls to actions. With each new Facebook post and video, it's extraordinarily rare to hear any sort of acknowledgement that, in fact, there are profoundly different ways of making sense of what is happening.
Instead, the conflict is more often presented as “sharp, painful dilemma” (FB-CH) that will remain so as long as Mormon leaders continue teaching what they do about sexuality, marriage and identity. THAT narrative, for virtually all same-sex attracted youth in the Church, has become the unquestioned REALITY in which they try to sort out their identity and their future.
And embedded within that narrative, everything becomes pretty hard to make sense of…After coming to identify as gay, one man spoke of the challenge of having “two conflicting identities.” They reflected, “I realized why people get depressed, and suicidal because you're constantly trying to resolve something that's irresolvable” (FB-TI). Another added, “It's hard to even go day by day. Not knowing how you're going to reconcile this about yourself, how you're going to create a life that is happy in any way” (FB-H).
Back to my main question for you, Tyler: Is this conflict and confusion a direct result of teachings within the Church or teachings outside of the Church…or perhaps the result of a jarring interface between the two?! (in which case, both sides would hold a shared responsibility for action)
While disagreeing on the exact origins of the conflict, we can surely agree on how shattering it can feel for anyone to feel compelled to walk away from something they used to trust and love. As one person described the moment of concluding they were gay: “All [previous] teaching about my identity…was WRONG! I had so many ideas of what I thought my life was going to be like, and who I was going to be, and how I was going to be that for the world and those people that I loved and had grown up with. And as I grew up and as I figured out more about myself and who I was, I began to realize that that person that I had been raised to be been not who I actually was” (FB-KA, italics mine).
Whatever faith someone used to have, whatever joy or peace they used to feel, whatever security they may have known within their formerly beloved faith, these individuals conclude that they must walk away. Other accounts describe the “dream for me ever since before I was born” laid aside (FB-RU) or walking away from everything they had been taught to value such as a mission, marriage, the Church itself: “When that happened, the whole world sort of came crashing down” (FB-BE)
Another parent described what many feel in the process: “I had to re-examine everything I had previously thought…It upended my notions of truth, happiness, obedience, loyalty, and in fact all that I held dear, including my perception of the character of God….All of my beliefs have been upended and rearranged.”
What impact does this kind of wrenching upheaval play in potentially destabilizing individuals further – especially vulnerable young people?
I've had several grown, adult friends tell me of stepping away from the community they had always known as one of the most excruciating experiences of their lives. Even the harshest critics of Mormonism would agree that this distancing, separation and estrangement…well, it often hurts. A lot.
But once again, why does it hurt?
I've done more, I admit, than simply ask you that question a few times, Tyler. I've challenged you (and other allied voices), to re-think what your accusations might mean for the very vulnerable youth we're all trying to help.
For their sake's, if nothing more, we have to do more than trade accusations that insinuate ignorance, malevolence or hatred.
Those people do exist – but they're few and far between compared to the masses.What if we acknowledged that – moving decidedly towards a more productive conversation about our actual disagreements, without the toxic baggage of personal attacks. What if we insisted on the kind of wide-ranging conversation of suicide that acknowledged its complexity – and paid careful attention to every relevant perspective?
If we can trust each other enough to make space for that conversation, I think we could make some real progress – including and especially in keeping kids safe.
In the absence of that conversation, however, it's hard to deny that the angst and despair we are witnessing may spread even further – just like the forest fire we see enveloping our nation's politics.
Let's fight this fire together!
I can personally vouch that leaders like Kendall Wilcox, Erika Munson, Vicki Wimmer Johnson, Jen Blair, John Gustav-Wrathall, Jim Struve & Jerry Buie (and their posse), Jay Jacobsen, Sarah Langford, Tera Brown, Greg Harris & Ty Mansfield are all deeply committed to fostering a public conversation where the deepest, most vociferous of disagreements can exist alongside the truest of love and loyalty.
Sounds like a piece of Zion to me?
I trust this group of leaders, in particular, and believe we will be strongest if we chart the path forward together.Will you join your powerful, beautiful voice to theirs, Tyler?
I hope so. As we all know, lives are depending on what we all do next.
Travellers queue for passport control at Stockholm Arlanda Airport on the Nordic countries' first day of visa-free travel in 2001 | Henrik Montgomery/EPA What is the EEA and EFTA? The European Economic Area and the European Free Trade Association — a run down of who's in and who's out.
Britain's exit from the European Union looks increasingly likely to involve a transitional period on the fringes of the bloc while it maintains some of the advantages it currently enjoys and gives it more time to negotiate the details of a future trading relationship. Some soft Brexiteers even hope the U.K. can stay on the fringes indefinitely.
The most likely approach is for it to rejoin the European Economic Area from outside the EU, putting it in a similar position to Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. The agreement creating the EEA entered into force on January 1, 1994 and brings together the EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway in a single market, referred to as the "Internal Market."
If you're wondering how that differs from the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) — a much older free-trade area that was created by the EFTA Convention signed in Stockholm in 1960 — not to mention the Schengen Area and the eurozone, POLITICO's cheatsheet is for you.
Friday the 13th proved to be the beginning of a run of luck for 40-year-old Roberto Gaspar, who lives in Hodgson, Man.
Gaspar and their partner, Dana Sinclair, had their first child together that day. But it wasn't the first child for Gaspar — it was their seventh.
When Roberto Gaspar of Hodgson, Man., last saw their boys 20 years ago, they were babies. (Ramando Gaudette)
The newborn made them think of their twin boys, Robert and Ramando. They hadn't seen them since they were six months old, more than 20 years ago.
Gaspar was still a teenager when they found out their ex-girlfriend had put the twins up for adoption. They later discovered that their daughter, Angelica, had also been adopted.
While the boys were kept together, their sister was adopted by another family. Gaspar said the children didn't have their last name and they were powerless to do anything about the adoptions.
According to Gaspar, their biological mother had a troubled life and didn't share any information with them about the adoptions, even when they spoke to them just before they died last year.
'I couldn't believe it'
Still, they were able to find Angelica a short time later and they've grown close. But the whereabouts of the boys remained a mystery. That weighed heavily on Gaspar in the days after their latest child, Persayus, was welcomed into the world.
"I was laying in bed and I looked at my girlfriend and said, 'You know, I really got to find a way to find my boys. I'm going crazy about these boys, I can't find them.'"
Sinclair asked them if they wanted them to put a post on Facebook indicating they were looking for the boys.
"And I was like, 'You think it's going to help?' " said Gaspar. "She goes 'Yeah, it will help.' I told them what to say and they put the post up."
They wrote: "Hi my name is Roberto Gaspar I am looking to find my twin boys They were born at Grey Nuns hospital in Edmonton Alberta ...."
Gaspar and their partner, Dana Sinclair, had a baby on Friday, Oct. 13, just days before they found their long-lost sons. (Dana Sinclair)
The post included the few details Gaspar knew about the boys, which was their names and not much else. They also added a picture of themselves to the post.
What happened over the next 48 hours left the couple in shock.
"It took like five minutes to put up that post ... and the next day it was up to 6,000 [shares]," said Gaspar.
"I couldn't believe it."
Within three days, the post had been shared more than 27,000 times.
"I had no idea it was going to go this far, which is beautiful. I'm lost for words to be honest," said Gaspar.
Post goes viral
The post was quickly shared on Edmonton Facebook pages and by Tuesday morning, it reached 21-year-old Ramando Gaudette, who was getting ready for their day in the south Edmonton home they share with their adoptive parents.
"I was about to head out to work and then my mom gets a phone call from one of their older friends [saying], 'Hey, there's this Facebook post going around, apparently there's this guy looking for their twins and my mom is like, 'Wait, what?' " said Gaudette.
"I'm like, 'Ok this isn't real, right?'" they said. "I was kind of skeptical at first and then the more I read it and talked to my mom about it, they were like, 'Yeah, this is your actual dad.' It was so surreal, it was very overwhelming."
The Facebook post Gaspar and their partner, Dana Sinclair, wrote was shared more than 27,000 times. (Facebook)
They realized they bore a resemblance to the man in the photo that was included in the post. They thought the goatee-sporting, Harley-Davidson jacket-wearing man looked pretty cool.
"I was a little shocked," said Gaudette. "I'm like, 'Oh my goodness, that's my dad. They look awesome.'"
Gaudette's brother, Robert Gaudette, who was working out of town at the time, soon learned the news as well. They immediately began trying to contact their biological father and by Wednesday, they were speaking to them for the first time.
"We had a three-way phone call with them and it was very emotional," said Ramando Gaudette. "It's just crazy to think he's been looking for us for about 21 years now."
There were tears for both the boys and their dad.
"I couldn't stop crying, just everything went through my mind," said Gaspar.
"The first thing that I let them know was that I never gave up on them and they were always in my heart. It was too much. I was shaking, nerves were hitting high, my stomach was in knots."
When Ramando Gaudette saw the photo of their dad, they thought, 'He looks awesome.' (Rob Gaudette/facebook)
They spoke about their resemblance to one another and Ramando Gaudette wasted no time asking their dad an important question.
"I asked them why I couldn't grow facial hair," said Gaudette, with a laugh. "He doesn't have a problem with that at all. They just laughed and said, 'You'll get there.'"
More family found
The boys soon learned they would be able to reconnect with the sister they lost touch with so many years ago. They also found many other new family members, including four half-siblings.
"I woke up after I talked to my dad and I get all these friend requests on Facebook from all these family members I've basically never heard of before," said Gaudette.
Plans have been made for the boys to meet their uncles, aunts and grandmother, who all live nearby. This Christmas, Gaspar plans to host the whole lot at their home in Manitoba.
Ramando and Robert Gaudette on their 21st birthday. The boys were adopted as babies, by a family in Edmonton. (Ramando Gaudette)
"Before anything bad happens to me — because I am at the age when things show up, you know — I just wanted my kids to get to know each other," said Gaspar.
"I don't want to pull them away from nobody. I just want them to love each other and get to know each other. That's what I want."
The ordeal has been a lesson in the power of social media for both Gaspar and their sons.
"I think it's a great way to try to reach out to somebody," said Ramando Gaudette. "I mean, if you really love somebody and you want to find them, put up a post like that. For all you know, it could turn out like this."

KochiKame, which is short for Kochira Katsushika-ku Kamearikouen-mae Hashutsujo ("This is the police station in front of Kameari Park in Katsushika Ward"), was first serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump in September 1976 and is still ongoing, making it Weekly Shonen Jump's longest running manga series. The story follows the adventures of middle-aged police officer Kankichi Ryōtsu, whose crazy schemes are constantly getting them into trouble.
In first of the 6 crossover stories, "KochiKame vs. Osomatsu-san," the 6 Osomatsu brothers meet a bad police officer, and a "miracle" happens. Sora Ishihara, the author of the Osomatsu-san novelization, is writing the story and Naoyuki Asano, the character designer from the Osomatsu-san anime, will provide the illustrations.
In the next story, "Kochikame vs. Sorcerous Stabber Orphen" the hapless protagonist of KochiKame wakes up in an alternate world, wearing a strange bandana and jacket, looking just like a certain man named Orphen. Yoshinobu Akita and Yuuya Kusaka, the author and illustrator behind the original Orphen light novels, are also handling the crossover story.
The third crossover story, "Kochikame vs. Girls und Panzer" will feature a showdown between Kankichi and the Ōrai Girls' Academy tank-combat team. Scriptwriter Kunihiko Okada is writing the story, illustrated by Isao Sugimoto, Yukiko Harada, Yuichi Furuichi, Keiichiro Yagino of Graphnicia, and Eiji Iwase of Studio Tulip, all of whom worked on the original Girls und Panzer anime.
Then, in "Kochikame vs. Cheer Boys," the mens' cheerleading club will help cheer up the KochiKame character Lemon. The original creator of Cheer Boys, Ryō Asai, is writing the story and Kenichi Kondo, creator of the Cheer Boys manga adaptation, is proving the illustrations.
In the fifth crossover, "Kochikame vs. Haruchika," Haruta and Chika of the Shizumi Minami high school wind instrument club will encounter the bushy-eyebrowed police officer Kankichi after a strange incident. The original creator and illustrator for Haruchika, Sei Hatsuno and Hiko Yamanaka, respectively, will also work on the crossover story.
The final novel is a crossover with the Nazutoki wa Dinner no Ato de ("The After Dinner Mysteries") novel series. Tokuya Higashigawa, creator of the original novels, is writing the story, and the novel's illustrator Yūsuke Nakamura (The Tatami Galaxy) is also illustrating the crossover. The novel series has also inspired a live-action drama.
The KochiKame manga has inspired an anime, several animated specials, 2 anime compilation films, 2 live-action films, and a live-action drama. As part of the 40th anniversary celebration, Kochikame will get a new television anime this year, with the main cast reprising their roles, as well as a new stage play.

With the frequency, and success, of outdoor games in the NHL, many fans have been wondering if this means the feature will be returning to the NHL video game franchise from EA Sports.
On the last-gen systems, the Winter Classic has been a part of the game for the last few years. However, it has yet to be added to the current-gen consoles — PlayStation 4 and Xbox One — for players to enjoy. But that could be changing in the near future.
In a statement regarding the addition of outdoor games, the game's lead producer, Sean Ramjagsingh, said that although they can't comment on anything official just yet, it's something that the development team is looking at putting in the game.
“We'll start rolling out features in the next few months, but it's definitely something on our radar given the prominence of them,” they said.
The comments are sure to get fans talking about potentially recreating some amazing events in the virtual world. Of course, with the asupervisorstioned frequency of them, one would have to wonder how man stadiums, and which ones, would be included should the feature return to the series.
The next edition of the popular series — NHL 17 — is expected to be a major step forward for the franchise as it enters its third installment on PS4 and Xbox One. In addition to adding outdoor games, there has also been internal discussions about the game returning to the PC world in the near future as well as women's leagues.
In 2014 I wrote my first Javascript crypto library. Since then I've designed and written many such libraries - eight of which are deployed in popular Google products and services. Javascript crypto can help solve many problems, some of which I'm going to discuss in this post.
Some people have strong feelings about Javascript crypto, and with good reason. Writing crypto code in Javascript is difficult, because of the lack of types and the permissive nature of the run-times. You can always shoot yourself in the foot if you don't know what you're doing in any languages, but you don't even hear the shot in Javascript: the run-times don't usually complain, but they just silently give you an incorrect result.
For example, if you have an array x of 10 elements, accessing x[10] or x[11] won't throw an out of bound exception, but return undefined. This behavior is hostile to crypto code, as demonstrated in this neat exploit discovered by Bleichenbacher, the grandfather of many crypto attacks:
Visit http://people.eku.edu/styere/Encrypt/JS-AES.html . This is a Javascript implementation of AES. Encrypt this string: ưưưưưưưưưưưưưưưư as ASCII. Decrypt the ciphertext. XOR each character of the decryption with 0x52. And the result is the key.
What happened? The program expects ASCII inputs, but we give it Unicode. The function that causes the vulnerability is SubBytes
// do S-Box substitution
function SubBytes ( state , Sbox ) {
var i;
for ( i = 0 ; i < 16 ; i ++ )
state [ i ] = Sbox [ state [ i ] ];
return state;
}
The state variable holds the input. If state[i] >= 256, state[i] would become undefined,because Sbox is an array of only 256 elements.
Many libraries have this “type confusion” vulnerability. How do you fix it? First, you need to validate input. If a function accepts a byte array, it should always check input is an array whose elements are bytes. Secondly, you need to minimize type conversions. Instead of accepting strings in one function and big integers or byte arrays in others, we need to use a single type everywhere. Thirdly, instead of plain old array of numbers you should use typed arrays. When a function accepts an Uint8Array it knows that each element of input is a byte, without doing expensive type checks. Finally, you should Closure and annotate variables and parameters with its pseudo types. The Closure compiler will type-check your program and report type mismatch bugs.
After fixing the type problem, Javascript could only be as bad as other languages when it comes to XOR things together. I've seen broken crypto in C, C++, C#, Java, Ruby, Python, or ActionScript, etc. I disbelieve that Javascript crypto is too bad to do anything with it. The language has its annoying flaws, i.e., numbers are stored as floating point in a 52-bit mantissa, broken bitwise shift left, etc., but they only make the task of programming a crypto library a bit more fun and challenging, not riskier.
Most people consider Javascript crypto harmful after reading this article by Matasano Security (disclaimer: I worked at Matasano before joining Google, and I've always been a huge fan of @tqbf, one of the company's founders.) If you haven't go read it, I'll wait. The article has a good point, but many other criticisms are outdated. Javascript now has a secure PRNG . WebCrypto provides many native crypto primitives, including a secure key storage. Guess what do Stanford, Google, and Microsoft have in common? Each has released an open source Javascript crypto library. No other languages have enjoyed this tremendous support.
That said, I totally agree with its main criticism: if you distrust the network or the server, doing Javascript crypto, with the code being loaded directly over that network from that server, makes you vulnerable to active network attackers or the server itself. If the server or the network is considered as adversary in your threat model, don't trust Javascript crypto code delivered from them. This threat model doesn't, however, apply to most applications. For example, as a Chrome extension End-To-End is immune against this threat. Next I'm going to showcase a few applications of Javascript crypto that are safe too.
1. Build crypto clients
Without Javascript crypto you don't have SSH-In-A-Tab, PwdHash, various Bitcoin wallets, etc. Do you have a Chromecast? If you don't, go buy one. It's amazing. Did you know that it uses Javascript crypto to make the out of box setup so easy and yet secure?
We're living in a world dominated by apps, it's easy to forget that instead of installing an app to do something you can visit a website on your favorite browser and get the same thing done instantly, thanks to the power of Javascript.
2. Stay out of scope of PCI DSS
Large scale systems usually process web requests as follows: Browsers <----> Load Balancers <---> Reverse Proxies <---> Frontends <---> Backends. If the requests contain credit card numbers, all intermediate components must comply to the PCI DSS standard, which could be annoying. To keep the load balancers, the reverse proxies or the frontends out of scope by you can use Javascript crypto to encrypt credit card numbers on browsers and only decrypting them on backends.
3. Avoid data leaks
Because many advertisers are slow in upgrading to HTTPS many advertisement serving systems still use clear text HTTP. Despite lack of encryption, these systems collect and transfer tons of personal data. Javascript crypto, served from a HTTPS origin, ensures collected data in motion are safe against interception.
4. Reduce latency
You have a big fat website that takes many seconds to load because it has megabytes of Javascript code. You may want to cache the base code in localStorage, and download only small diffs. This design is, however, vulnerable to cache poisoning attack. If an attacker manages to insert a backdoor to the cached code (by exploiting a XSS, for example) they will have permanent access (see this talk by my colleague Artur Janc for more details). You need to protect the integrity of the cached code by using a digital signature. You sign the code on the server, and use Javascript crypto to verify the signature.
Conclusion : Programming crypto in Javascript is hard, but doable. As usual if you don't know crypto, you should use good libraries developed by professionals. Javascript crypto has many applications, and has received unprecedented support from Stanford , Google , Microsoft and W3C .
Ohio Governor John Kasich insults Daniel Radcliffe for being an atheist.
Kasich, Governor of Ohio and former 2016 GOP presidential candidate, went off on actor Daniel Radcliffe earlier this week in New Hampshire because Radcliffe is an atheist.
Kasich was in New Hampshire to endorse fellow Republican Chris Sununu for Governor. After the endorsement Kasich toured downtown Exeter with Sununu and some of their campaign aides. After the entourage wandered into a local bookstore Kasich looked at the latest Harry Potter book, and without prompting, went off on actor Daniel Radcliffe for being atheist.
Kasich said:
You know that Daniel Radcliffe has declared themselves an atheist? I'm serious. What a weird thing. Why would a guy who has had all that success just, I mean, what the hell is wrong with him?
Wow. What a despicable thing to say. Imagine the outcry if instead of insulting atheists Kasich had insulted Muslims, Jews, or Christians?
I mean, what the hell is wrong with him? Why do they think they can insult people for being atheists?
In addition to insulting atheists, Kasich is also assuming that success is somehow dependent upon a god that does not exist. This is childish. In reality, the belief that the wealthy and successful are chosen by God is a naive and silly world view that most intellectually competent Christians eschew.
As for Radcliffe, made famous by their recurring role as Harry Potter in the blockbuster movie franchise, they have been quite open and vocal about being an atheist. In a 2012 interview Radcliffe declared:
I'm not religious, I'm an atheist, and a militant atheist when religion starts impacting on legislation.
Radcliffe deserves credit for being out and open about being an atheist, even if it means being insulted by intellectually incompetent idiots like Kasich.
As for Kasich, they have made a habit out of insulting the godless. Last year the conservative Christian Kasich warned that “secularists” lack values and “the sense of right and wrong that comes from the great religions.”
Bottom line: The fact that Kasich, the Governor of Ohio, can casually insult all atheists without consequence is disturbing. If they had publicly insulted a popular figure for being a Muslim, or a Jew, or a Christian, the media outrage would have been deafening. Yet when they insult an atheist: crickets.

Ned Parker is a freelance journalist, a former fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the Baghdad bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times from 2009 to 2011.
Lt. Gen. Michael Barbero did three tours of duty in Iraq. The first time in 2003 in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown. Then during the U.S. troop surge as a key aide to Gen. David Petraeus and again from 2009 to 2011, overseeing the training of Iraqi security forces.
In November, they were in Baghdad as a business consultant. They sat face to face with a former Iraqi official in a heavily guarded palatial office. Their conversation was emblematic of all that has gone wrong in the relationship between the United States and Iraq since 2011.
Story Continued Below
“This … started out as a successful joint venture but you left too quickly and created a vacuum,” the former official told Barbero as the men sipped tea. The ex-official, a Shiite who has held important posts in the Iraqi government, took the retired general to task for America's close relationship with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, whose critics consider them a budding authoritarian ruler, and warned: “It's not only al Qaeda but also government measures that threaten democracy and democratic institutions.”
Barely two months after Barbero's visit, and two years after the last U.S. troops departed Iraq in December 2011, ending an eight-year presence, Iraq is in flames. Al Qaeda has seized territory in western Anbar province; Maliki's forces are fighting alongside some Sunni tribesmen against al Qaeda; while other Sunni tribes are in a full-scale revolt against both al Qaeda and Maliki's forces, whom they see as oppressive as the Sunni radicals they detest.
It begs the question that many are now asking back in Washington: What went wrong? Did America lose Iraq? What happened to the country that President Barack Obama and their aides have described again and again over the last two years as stable, prosperous and democratic?
The president's critics have one theory: “Obama did not want to stay in Iraq, and that's what it was all about,” as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) put it this week. “If we'd had a residual force of 10- to 12,000 [troops], I am totally convinced there would not have been a rise of al Qaeda,” according to McCain's fellow hawk, Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.).
The White House has another message: We did all we could, but the Iraqis didn't want an agreement. Besides, no one could have predicted Syria's deleterious effect on Iraq.
So who's right? Was the new violence in Iraq indeed the White House's fault for not securing a troop agreement? Did Obama, who ran for president promising to end the war, ever really intend to sign a deal? And could the United States have done more to help stabilize Iraq once its soldiers left?
What happened is far more complicated than the critics contend. It's the story of an administration that struggled to define its relationship with Iraq as it withdrew the majority of its forces, and that was unclear about what its future military presence should look like. It is the story of an Iraqi government whose politics were poisonous, where one's stance on the status of American troops became another weapon for rivals to bludgeon each other. And none of it fits neatly into a tight Washington narrative.
***
It was the April 2010 national election and its tortured aftermath that sewed the seeds of today's crisis in Iraq. Beforehand, U.S. state and military officials had prepared for any scenario, including the possibility that Maliki might refuse to leave office for another Shiite Islamist candidate. No one imagined that the secular Iraqiya list, backed by Sunni Arabs, would win the largest number of seats in parliament. Suddenly the Sunnis' candidate, secular Shiite Ayad Allawi, was poised to be prime minister. But Maliki refused and dug in.
And it is here where America found its standing wounded. Anxious about midterm elections in November and worried about the status of U.S. forces slated to be drawn down to 50,000 by August, the White House decided to pick winners. According to multiple officials in Baghdad at time, Vice President Joseph Biden and then-Ambassador Chris Hill decided in July 2010 to support Maliki for prime minister, but Maliki had to bring the Sunnis and Allawi onboard. Hill and their staff then made America's support for Maliki clear in meetings with Iraqi political figures.
The stalemate would drag on for months, and in the end both the United States and its arch-foe Iran proved would take credit for forming the government. But Washington would be damaged in the process. It would be forever linked with endorsing Maliki. One U.S. Embassy official I spoke with just months before the government was formed privately expressed regret at how the Americans had played kingmaker.

John Alleman, 52, collapsed at bus stop outside restaurant that sells burgers, fries and drinks with huge calorie counts
The mascot for the Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas has died of a heart attack. They were the second unpaid mascot to die in the past two years.
John Alleman, 52, collapsed while waiting at a bus stop in front of the diner last week. They were taken off life support on Monday, the Las Vegas Sun reported.
The diner is famous for its huge hamburgers, extra-fat milkshakes and fries cooked in lard. It uses the tagline: "Taste worth dying for."
Its owner, Jon Basso, told the Sun that Alleman came to the restaurant daily and encouraged passing tourists to try its calorie-laden offerings.
"He never missed a day, even on Christmas," Basso said. "People just loved him. They connected with people in a real way."
Alleman became an unofficial mascot for the restaurant, which features waiteres in nurse garb. Their caricature as "Patient John" graced its merchandise and menus.
In 2011 another unofficial spokesperson, a 260kg (575lb) man named Blair River, died at age 29 from what was said to have been pneumonia.
In 2012 a man in their 40s was hospitalised after they began sweating and shaking while eating a 6,000-calorie Triple Bypass burger at the restaurant.
The diner features tongue-in-cheek health warnings and casts customers as patients. Customers are given surgical gowns as they choose from a high-calorie menu.
Basso said Alleman weighed about 82kg (180lb) at their death.
Rock inscriptions and tomb carvings have shed light on the large beasts that thrived in Egypt before they were wiped out around 6,000 years ago.
The etchings depict horned hartebeest and oryx, as well as other big mammals, that lived in the Nile Valley before its ecology changed dramatically, and the country became drier overall.
Experts claim that 37 large bodied mammals including lions, wild dogs, elephants and giraffes, lived in Egypt before the time of the pharaohs which began in 3,100 BC - compared to just eight now.
Scientists studied depictions of animals in Egyptian artefacts to assemble a detailed record of the animals present in the Nile Valley going back to pre-dynastic times. This 5,150 year-old ceremonial stone palette is ramed by two wild dogs clasping one another's paws and features ostrich, hartebeest, oryx and giraffes
Scientists have used depictions of animals in Egyptian artefacts to assemble a detailed record of the animals present in the Nile Valley going back to pre-dynastic times.
The study shows species extinctions in the area - probably caused by a drying climate and an exploding human population - made the ecosystem progressively less stable.
One of the artefacts examined was a 5,150 year-old ceremonial stone palette housed in a museum at Oxford University.
It is framed by two wild dogs clasping one another's paws and features ostrich, hartebeest, wildebeest, ibex, oryx and giraffes.
The palette also features mythical creatures including serpent-necked panthers and what is thought to be a griffin - a legendary bird with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle.

CHANGING MAMMALS IN EGYPT
Experts say that 37 large bodied mammals also including lions, wild dogs, elephants and giraffes lived in Egypt before the time of the pharaohs which began in 3,100 BC - compared to just eight now.
Computational analysis identified five episodes when dramatic changes occurred in Egypt's mammals, three of which coincided with extreme environmental changes as the climate shifted to more arid conditions. These droughts also coincided with upheaval in human societies such as the collapse of the Old Kingdom around 4,000 years ago and the fall of the New Kingdom about 1,000 years later.
Dr Yeakel said: ‘There were three large pulses of aridification as Egypt went from a wetter to a drier climate - starting with the end of the African Humid Period 5,000 years ago when the monsoons shifted to the south.
‘At the same time human population densities were increasing and competition for space along the Nile Valley would have had a large impact on animal populations.'
The most recent major shift in mammalian communities occurred about 100 years ago. The analysis of predator-prey networks showed species extinctions in the past 150 years had a disproportionately large impact on ecosystem stability.
Another stone tablet, kept in the British Museum, shows human hunters armed with bows, spears, clubs and lassoes stalking lions, gazelles, hartebeest and an ostrich.
Dr Justin Yeakel, of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, explained that when there were many species in the area, the loss of any one had little impact on the rest, but now the ecosystem is much more sensitive to perturbations.
Dr Yeakel, who was at California University in Santa Cruz when they carried out the study, added: ‘What was once a rich and diverse mammalian community is very different now.
‘As the number of species declined one of the primary things lost was the ecological redundancy of the system. There were multiple species of gazelles and other small herbivores which are important because so many different predators prey on them.
‘When there are fewer of those small herbivores the loss of any one species has a much greater effect on the stability of the system and can lead to additional extinctions.'
The study, published in the journal PNAS, is based on records compiled in zoologist Dale Osborne's 1998 book The Mammals of Ancient Egypt, which was, itself, based on archaeological and palaeontological evidence, as well as historical records.
Dr Yeakel said: ‘Dale Osborne compiled an incredible database of when species were represented in artwork and how that changed over time. Their work allowed us to use ecological modelling techniques to look at the ramifications of those changes.'

Dr Yeakel said these findings have implications for understanding modern ecosystems.
‘This may be just one example of a larger pattern. We see a lot of ecosystems today in which a change in one species produces a big shift in how the ecosystem functions - and that might be a modern phenomenon,' they said.
So far, most self-driving bus trials have involved smaller pod-like vehicles trundling between short distances.
A new bus trial launched in Singapore aims to outfit regular large buses with clever technology, so they can operate along Singapore's busy main roads eventually.
The Land Transport Authority announced in a Facebook post that it will start an autonomous bus trial with two electric hybrid buses.

The buses will have a host of sensors placed on them, and local college Nanyang Technological University will build the navigation software to control the buses.
Once ready, the buses will travel the roughly 1.4-kilometre distance between the university at Nanyang Avenue, and nearby CleanTech One industrial park for a field trial.
The government agency said the trial route will possibly be extended to the nearby Pioneer train station at a later date. It didn't specify, however, when the trial will commence.

Driverless car accident in Singapore
The driverless bus announcement, however, comes just days after one of Singapore's newly launched autonomous cars collided with a lorry.
On Wednesday, MIT spinoff Nutonomy said it would be halting its driverless trial while it investigates how the accident happened.
Nutonomy set up operations in Singapore about a year ago, and just a month ago started trialing its self-driving cars in a small business district park in the island state.
Image caption Lib Dem Sarah Olney said Brexit would be "uppermost in voters' minds"
The Liberal Democrats have vowed to make the Richmond Park by-election about Brexit, not Heathrow.
The poll has been triggered by the resignation of Tory MP Zac Goldsmith in protest at ministers backing a third runway at the UK's largest airport.
Mr Goldsmith, who will run again as an independent, has said it "must be a referendum on Heathrow expansion".
But the likely Lib Dem candidate said Mr Goldsmith's backing for Brexit would be "uppermost in voters' minds".
Sarah Olney, who has already been selected to fight the seat at the next general election, said it was a "farce" the by-election was taking place, adding it was the result of Tory in-fighting but added that the Lib Dems were looking forward to "putting our message in front of voters".
Ms Olney, who like Mr Goldsmith is opposed to Heathrow expansion, told the BBC's Daily Politics: "We are on the same side as far as Heathrow is concerned, so for the voters to be able to choose between us, it's going to be fought on other issues - and I think Brexit is currently going to be the main issue that's uppermost in voters' minds."
A breakdown of the EU referendum results shows almost 70% of voters in the Richmond council area, which makes up the bulk of the constituency, backed Remain.

Ms Olney is expected to be confirmed as the party's pick for the by-election after party leader Tim Farron rejected the idea of parachuting in one of its big names.
The Conservatives are not fielding a candidate against Mr Goldsmith, who held the south-west London seat in 2015 with a 23,015 majority. The Lib Dems, who held the seat until 2010, finished second.
Labour says it will field a candidate despite three of its MPs urging it to consider standing aside to maximise the chances of defeating Mr Goldsmith.
The Green Party said it was also likely to put forward a candidate, although it said it supported "progressives working together to beat the Conservatives".
In standing down, Mr Goldsmith - who has long campaigned against a third runway - fulfilled a pledge to quit if the government backed the expansion.
They said: "There was no small print, no expiry date, no ambiguity. It was a simple promise. And it mattered.
"I know it mattered, because the thought of Heathrow expansion fills most of my constituents with dread."
The by-election will take place on 1 December.

Dear Richard, I wrote to you back in 2009 when I was in the 8th grade and you really helped me and I wanted to thank you for that. I just recently rediscovered your blog and I figured I would write to you again. I'm now a senior in high school and in the time since the 8th grade I've completely reassessed my faith. For a little while I kept trying to be Christian, and for about a year I was. I feel like that was good for me though. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think it's a very unwise thing to completely disown one's faith in middle school. I have, however, come to the conclusion that I am an atheist, and I honestly do not see that changing. I'm just worried about any fallout caused by this, and I don't quite know how to approach certain situations that I face on a near daily basis. I'm trying to get some answers to questions preemptively in hopes that when I'm faced with these situations (either once again or someday in the future) I will know the best way to handle them. I'm not planning on “coming out” so to say until I go to college a year from now, and that will probably only be to my college friends and perhaps my agnostic father as I live in Mississippi. I wish I could do it earlier because lying and saying I'm a Christian kills me. My friends constantly speak negatively about atheists without knowing that I am one and it makes me realize that were they to find out the truth I would probably lose their friendship. I don't know how to respond when they start bashing atheists. I would like to say something but at the same time I'm worried that doing so will trigger a line of questioning about why I don't think atheists are idiotic, hell-bound heathens bent on destroying everything good in world and who have absolutely no morals. When my friends start speaking negatively about the nonreligious, I feel incredibly awkward. What would be the best way of responding to this? Many people have suggested that I look into religious colleges (some of which are very good) and I have to come up with some flimsy excuse as to why they don't interest me besides their religious affiliation. What would be a good way of responding to this besides saying “Well I'm not Baptist”? That doesn't seem to be working so well as many people will argue that I'm Christian which means denomination shouldn't matter. I have a friend who I believe is atheist or at the very least agnostic, and I would love to be able to confide in them but I don't know if this would be a good idea or not. I think he's trustworthy but then again I don't know for sure. I'd hate to confide in them and then have people find out my religious non-affiliation. It would make my senior year hell, but telling someone trustworthy would take a weight off of my shoulders. What would you advise? Should I wait a year until I'm in college or say something to this person I think might be trustworthy but I don't know for sure. There's also a good chance that I will be making a speech at my graduation (I'm Salutatorian), and if I do I will of course be expected to recognize the Christian God as everyone who has ever made a speech has. If I don't, it will be highly suspect. Should I honor my non beliefs and make no mention of a God or just say something to avoid suspicions? I'm also worried about my mother's side of the family. They're very devout Christians which I have respect for. I know that this problem isn't one that I'll have to deal with for a while, but I'm quite worried that in a few years when they find out (which they have to eventually seeing as I'll be getting married one day and no mention of religion or gods will be made during the service) I'll be completely disowned. Of course I will wait as long as I can to say something to them, but I don't know if I could handle being the family pariah. How do I handle being the only nonreligious family member (excluding my dad but my parents are divorced so they don't count) in a very religious family? Sorry for this being a bit long and all over the place, I just really need some guidance right now. Thank you for everything.
Brett
Dear Brett,
Coming out as an atheist should be only for your wants, only for your needs, and only on your time. It can be a controlled process, rather than a sudden, chaotic, and often destructive event. You can do it when, with whom, and as fast as whatever suits your own personal interests. To accomplish this you must find the right balance between the inner pressure to express yourself openly, and the outer pressures from the situation around you that warrant caution.
It's wonderful to hear from you again. Since your first letter, almost exactly four years have passed. Both of your letters demonstrate your high level of intelligence, and both demonstrate the emotional and social difficulties that go along with adolescence. Please understand that this remark is not a put-down. It is simply a fact of human development that even though some people's cognitive intelligence can be well advanced beyond their years, for most of us our emotional and interpersonal development is closely tied to our physical development, and that requires time passing. Very often we simply have to wait out the years while our bodies mature so that our emotions can mature.
At the time of your first letter, you were in the first part of your adolescence. One of the most important concerns of adolescents is to be accepted by peers, to fit in socially, and to avoid being an outcast. It's a normal and sometimes painful stage.
Now you are moving out of adolescence and into your young adulthood. Over the next few years you will probably notice a shift from wanting to please and fit in with friends to wanting to be true to your own convictions. Your personal integrity will become more important, while popularity and being accepted will become less so. The tension you're experiencing right now when you say “lying and saying I'm a Christian kills me” is that process already underway.
As this process continues, instead of pretending to be what your friends approve of, you will begin to look for new friends who accept you as you are. If your current friends are unable or unwilling to accept you as you are, then you are going to drift away from them anyway, even if you don't tell them the truth about your atheism. In college, you will have a far wider selection of potential friends from which to choose.
Given the situation and environment that you have described, I agree with you that it's probably wise for you to wait until you're out of high school, one year from now. I can certainly understand your wanting to continue to be discreet in your senior year. Although your inner tension to be open and frank is increasing, the reality of the hostile environment in a Mississippi high school remains a constant. I don't know what to suggest about your friend whom you think might be an atheist and whom you think might be trustworthy. If that friend's failure to be trustworthy will “make your senior year hell,” then perhaps it's better to not risk it. You don't need the extra burden and distraction of being socially ostracized and harassed while you concentrate on maintaining your high grades that will give you a broader choice of colleges, and possibly scholarships. This is an example of weighing that balance between inner and outer pressures I spoke of at the beginning.
your Salutatorian graduation speech is the very last thing you'll do in high school. You might also consider it the very first thing you'll do in your young adulthood. Perhaps it's better to not start your new stage of life with a public lie.
I think it's likely that most of the people in your high school you will never see again. If any of their tongues wag just because they noticed that you didn't mention a supernatural being in your speech, so what? You don't have to announce, “Hey everybody, I'm an atheist!” if you don't want to, but you can certainly make it a speech about what is important to you as you face your future with both hope and rationality, and you can leave out things that are not important to you. As Salutatorian, you have earned that privilege.
Begin to realize that as an adult you don't have to give everyone clear, thorough, and completely self-revealing answers to every one of their nosey questions if that is not in your own best interest. If people ask you about your speech, try shrugging your shoulders. Say something about how several other people mentioned God or Jesus, and you wanted to talk about other things. That response will just have to do for them.
Picking the college of your choice should be just that, your choice. Choose according to what will be best for your education and your career, and for your mental health. Definitely don't go to a religious college if that means you'll have to continue pretending to be something you're not and covering up who you really are. Develop a response for anyone who might ask why your choice isn't a religious college. Say something like, “I've carefully weighed all the factors, and this college will be the best for my needs.” A response like that is honest yet not revealing, and it has a slight tone of finality, even dismissal to it, subtly implying that further discussion is not necessary.
Check to see if any of the colleges you're considering have a Secular Student Alliance or a similar support group for non-believing students. It's one more plus for that institution. Selecting a college with a significant distance from your home town, such as out of state will be much better for your privacy. Get an electronic copy (easier to conceal) of Hemant Mehta's The Young Atheist's Survival Guide: Helping Secular Students Thrive. It has many useful insights and suggestions.
If your parents will be helping you with college expenses, then unfortunately your discretion with them about your atheism might still be prudent at least until you're well established at the college of your choice. I have received several letters depicting parents who have either threatened or actually cut off funding for their child's college education unless they renounce their atheism and “come back to the fold.” Such attempts at religious extortion are as ugly as they are ridiculous, and you don't want to have a similar experience if you can avoid it.
Finding atheist friends at college will probably relieve much of that tension of needing to be yourself with people, and that might help you to bear keeping the charade up a little longer with your family until you're no longer dependent on them. Your family is on a need to know basis about this, and given the attitudes that you have described, they don't need to know yet. I'm not advocating secretiveness. I'm advocating well-considered prudence. You have the right to decide this just for your own needs.
But I think that eventually you'll have to be open with them for two reasons:
1) Continuing to pretend for decades to come will keep you in an adolescent role with them, making it difficult for all of you to finally transition from parent-to-child relationships into relationships of adult-to-adult.
2) The truth tends to get out. If it gets out in a way that is not controlled by you, it can result in reactions of fear, anger, and hurt that you might be able to minimize if you are able to tell them in your own terms and on your own time.
Your father seems to remain the enigma that they were four years ago. If you have gained any inkling that they would at least be discreet and possibly even receptive to your atheism, they might have insight and advice to help you with the rest of the family.
If by the time you have established an independent life of your own, and you have found someone with whom you want to share your life, but your family members still cannot accept you as you are and they “disown” you in one way or another for being an atheist, then let them. Move on. I admire the loving kindness you show for your family, and I know this will be difficult, but families are supposed to nurture their members. If your family stifles, belittles and condemns you, then clinging to their approval will only harm you more, and it won't do them any good either. If it comes to this, tell them that if they ever find love somewhere in their misguided hearts, they can contact you, but not until they are willing to accept you as you are and to treat you respectfully. As the emotional maturity and self-confidence of your adulthood comes to its full blossom, this will not be as hard to do as it might sound now.
Be yourself. Be Real. Be free. All that is a process, not a sudden event. Choosing the timing and pace of that process for your own self-interest is an important part of the balance of freedom and wisdom that you are practicing right now.
Please keep us updated as important things develop, and please be sure to tell us how it came down after your graduation. I and several people here care about you, and we would very much like to know.

Philadelphia Moves Towards Divesting from Wells Fargo
Philadelphia, PA – On May 1st, 2017, the City of Philadelphia moved closer towards ending its relationship with Wells Fargo. The City Council's Committee on Finance unanimously voted to end its 48-year relationship with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo currently oversees the city's $2billion per-year employee payroll account.
The resolution was sponsored by Councilwoman Cindy Bass. In a statement Councilwoman Cindy Bass praised their colleagues for their vote, “As many of you know, I have been pushing for the city to divest from Wells Fargo for quite some time. Time and time again their actions have revealed them to be the antithesis of corporate social responsibility. I want to thank my colleagues on the committee for doing the right thing and sending a message that we will not do business with companies that engage in unethical business practices.”
Seattle, Los Angeles, San Fransisco, Missoula, the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, Davis, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, and the Mille Lacs Band Of Ojibwe have all divested from Wells Fargo due in large part to their financial backing of the Dakota Access pipeline and other unethical business pratices.
The bill will be up for a final vote by city council members next week, and if approved, Wells Fargo will provide a six-month period for the city to transition to Citizens Bank.

Newburgh Brewing Made an Eggbert-Themed IPA — And It's Selling Out Fast
Head to the taproom to taste the new brew dedicated to the Hudson Valley Christmas icon.

Shuffling through the winter wonderland, you gaze at the shimmering LED lights dangling overhead, the toy train chugging along a figure-8 track, the candy canes and lollipops bordering the path. The line zig-zags forward, and you hear a voice boom in the distance.
It's him.
Your palms start to sweat as you recite your Christmas list over and over in your head: Gamecube, 64-pack of crayons, wait — what was after crayons?
The line advances. You catch a glimpse of them through the doorway: wide-set on their throne, a rosy blush in their cheeks, a glint in their eye.
You're ushered through the door and up to a microphone, but, before you can say anything, they greet you by name and asks what you'd like for Christmas.
Your parent nudges you, but you're frozen, mouth agape, wondering how they knew your name. Another nudge and you robotically mumble your Christmas list into the microphone. They thank you, wishes you a Merry Christmas, and suddenly you're back at Devitt's Nursery and Supply.
This is the magic of Eggbert.
Try as we might, the magic of Eggbert simply can't be explained; only experienced.  They are but another icon unique to the Hudson Valley, and that's why Newburgh Brewing Company has crafted and named their latest beer in their honor.
According to President and Chief Operating Officer, Paul Halayko, the idea originated in winter 2016 when the brewery sold pint glasses with Eggbert's face on them. Folks who purchased a glass also received $1 off beers throughout December.
Thanks to a new canning machine (or perhaps a Christmas miracle), the idea evolved into an entirely new brew in December 2017.
This month, Angry Eggbert IPA returns to Newburgh Brewing Company's taproom. Brewed with spruce needles that the staff trimmed themselves, Angry Eggbert is a departure from conventional winter beers like stouts and porters. Halayko describes it as light-bodied and balanced with touches of citrus and pine.
They also say supplies are limited; the beer is expected to sell out faster than you can say "Santa Claus."
Commemorate by the glass or grab a four-pack for $15. Either way, be sure to mark your calendar for Friday, November 16, the day of Eggbert's official 2018 release. It also happens to mark the return of Eggbert After Dark, the magical evening when Eggbert visits the brewery to chat with the adults — without any child supervision.
Due to popular demand, part of the Eggbert supply will be reserved for a third and final Eggbert After Dark event on December 28. If you don't get a chance to sample the beer in November, this will be your last chance to do so before it disappears for good (for the year at least).
With all of this demand heading into the holidays, it's easy to forget the most important question: How does Eggbert feel about all of this?
“Eggcited,” they say.

Filing period to begin for spring election
hello
The new election season officially begins Monday when candidates for municipal, school, park, library and fire district offices in DuPage County begin filing their nominating petitions for spots on the April 4 ballot.
Most of the hopefuls must submit their paperwork with the governmental entity they want to represent, although school board candidates will take their documents to the DuPage County Election Commission office in Wheaton.
The weeklong filing period ends at 5 p.m. Dec. 19.
In the meantime, several key mayoral races already appear to be taking shape.
Longtime Warrenville Mayor David Brummel, for example, likely will face at least one opponent in their bid for a fourth term. Brummel said he's expecting Michael Hoffmann, the city council member they defeated in 2013, to make another attempt to become mayor.
Brummel said he's seeking re-election because they love Warrenville and enjoys working with the city's employees and elected officials.
"I get to be involved with things going forward that are very positive and will be here after I'm gone," Brummel said. "There's the potential to leave my community a better place than I found it. I find that to be very satisfying."
In Bensenville, the resignation of Village President Frank Soto to take a state job has resulted in at least two village trustees expected to vie for the town's top elected position.
Soto said trustees Henry Wesseler and Frank DeSimone are planning to run for village president. Wesseler has been a trustee since 2009; DeSimone was elected in April 2015.
With Roselle Mayor Gayle Smolinski stepping down after more than two decades, there also should be a great deal of interest in that post.
That probably won't be the case in Glen Ellyn, where Village President Alex Demos is sticking to a time-honored tradition in the village by voluntarily stepping down after just one term. The village's Civic Betterment Party has picked Diane McGinley, a former trustee, to run for the village president seat.
Other candidates can run against Civic Betterment nominees by submitting nominating petitions with the village clerk's office during the filing period, but the party's candidates almost always go on to win.
The list of mayors and village presidents expected to seek re-election includes Addison's Rich Veenstra, Bloomingdale's Franco Coladipietro, Glendale Heights' Linda Jackson, Itasca's Jeff Pruyn, Lisle's Joe Broda, Lombard's Keith Giagnorio, Oakbrook Terrace's Tony Ragucci, West Chicago's Ruben Pineda and Winfield's Erik Spande. Villa Park Village President Deborah Bullwinkel also is up for re-election.
The field for what may be the hottest of all the mayoral races already has been set, with five candidates currently on the ballot for a Feb. 28 primary election in Aurora.
Four of the candidates -- Linda Chapa LaVia, Rick Guzman, Richard Irvin and Mike Saville -- have been campaigning for the seat since Tom Weisner announced they would step down before the end of their third term due to health concerns. The fifth mayoral candidate is Jose Luis Del Bosque.

Fire crews spent hours Tuesday morning extinguishing a massive three-alarm fire at a residential building in Rockville, Md.
The fire started around 4:15 a.m. at Building G at the Gables Upper Rock Apartments on Upper Rock Circle. Montgomery County fire officials say the three-acre complex was 90 percent complete and expected to be finished in two to three weeks before this fire ripped through 150 units.
The view from Chopper4 showed the complex engulfed in flames, with the majority of the building gutted as crews fought to get the flames under control.
The apartment complex is a total loss, an estimated $15-$20 million.

"The building's been deemed unsafe to occupy, which means the stability of the walls and the roof are just not safe," said Pete Piringer of Montgomery County Fire and Rescue.
By Tuesday afternoon, crews were still at the scene, throwing water on hot spots. More than 12 hours later, it was still smoldering in spots.

"The fire was huge. The orange glow was shining into my window and woke me up. After a while, I had to leave the apartment because the smoke was coming in," said Jessica Ainsworth, who lives in a neighboring building.
Fire officials believe gas tanks inside the building were possibly feeding the flames.
There are no reported injuries.
About 200 firefighters battled the blaze.

First Runner-Up: Life is Strange
Ed McGlone
At the beginning of the year, no one here on the Twinfinite staff would have predicted that Life is Strange would be appearing here on this list. Even amidst all the AAA, high profile competition, a little episodic game about two teenagers captured our hearts and conquered all but one game for us. How did that happen? Max and Chloe, that's how.
For many of us here at Twinfinite, Life is Strange catapulted its two main protagonists, Max and Chloe, into iconic video game characters that will be remembered for years to come. Watching Max struggle with their new time-twisting power and seeing them come to terms with how much damage they were doing to their best friend Chloe and the world, was an emotionally draining experience across Life is Strange's five episodes.
It's hard to doubt that Max had all the best intentions in the world and tried to use their powers for good. However, Life is Strange hammered home the point that you shouldn't mess with time, with each episode ending with Max further botching everything up. It all culminates into a brutal final choice that forced us to really examine our values and after absorbing five episodes worth of content, who and/or what was most important to us (the player). Final choices for decision-driven games are almost guaranteed to be divisive and at times, unpopular (just ask Mass Effect 3). However, Life is Strange presented us with one that puts everything you could care about at stake and shows us how that choice impacted the future. For us, that's all you can really ask for.
Aside from the supernatural, Max and Chloe also had relatable teenage issues that touched home with us as well. Bullying, sex, love, problems at home; all of these were obstacles that Max and Chloe needed to overcome and it made us root for them to succeed that much more.
The technical stuff such as the gameplay and visuals are nothing that will blow people away. However, they all play a supporting role in telling the story of Max and Chloe in a way that was so touching and memorable. It is because of that Life is Strange is number 2 and first runner-up in our 2015 Game of the Year list.

Buy any bag of fruit or vegetables from your local store and chances are a few of them have been damaged or spoiled during harvesting, storage, and transport. Depending on how bad they are you may just eat them anyway, but such spoilage leads to a lot of waste.
James Rogers, a materials science student at UC Santa Barbara believes they have solved the problem with the development of a new coating. It's organic, edible, and can be used to coat fruit and vegetables to maintain their freshness and protect them from damage.
It is known as aPEEL Technology with the coating containing the ediPEEL formula. That formula is essentially a water-based organic preservative created from natural plant extracts that otherwise would be classed as a waste product. Each piece of fruit and veg has the resultant coating applied simply by dipping them in it and allowing it to dry.
By coating the fresh food it stops water loss and acts as a barrier against oxygen, therefore preventing oxidation. So good is the coating that it can replace the need to refrigerate certain types of fruit and veg, effectively cutting storage costs as well as waste.
The ediPEEL coating has already been proven to work, but Rogers has a lot of research still to do in order to tweak the coating for different types of fruit and veg. As the skin of a fruit/vegetable can vary, so must the coating in order to stick to it. There's also plans to adapt it for leafy greens, meaning bags of salads could last longer after being opened, too.
Once Rogers has every iteration figured out it should mean we all get fresher food available to us, probably without even realizing this coating has been applied.

Washington (CNN) – The world is religiously diverse and overwhelmingly faithful, according to a study released Tuesday by The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.
The study, which is a snapshot of world religions in 2010 and does not show trends, brings to light a unique religious landscape that's defined by a burgeoning Islam, a shifting Christianity and a large group of religiously unaffiliated. It took Pew three years to compile.
Five big takeaways from the study:
1.) Muslims and Hindus are noticeably young
The median age of Muslims (23) and Hindus (26) is significantly lower than the global median age of 28 years old.
“Those with a large share of adherents in fast-growing, developing countries tend to have younger populations,” the Pew report says. “Those concentrated in China and in advanced industrial countries, where population growth is slower, tend to be older.”
Other than Muslims and Hindus, all other religious groups have a median age that is older than the global median.
“Christians have a median age of 30, followed by members of other religions (32), adherents of folk or traditional religions (33), the religiously unaffiliated (34) and Buddhists (34),” reads the study. “Jews have the highest median age (36), more than a dozen years older than the youngest group, Muslims.”
According to Hackett, these young median ages for Muslims and Hindus are largely because of high fertility rates and “indicates that they have a significant growth potential.”
2.) The world is faithful and diverse
According to numbers compiled by Pew, more than 80% of the world's population identifies with a religious group.
While Christians are the largest group, with 31.5% of the global population, Muslims (23.2%), the unaffiliated (16.3%) and Hindus (15%) together make up more than half of the global population.
Jews, a religious group that makes up 2% of the United States, have a tiny share of the global pie. Only .2% of the global population practices Judaism, a number that puts the religion behind Buddhists (7.1%), folk religionists (5.9%) and a combination of religions like the Baha'i faith, Jainism, Sikhism, Shintoism, Taoism, Tenrikyo, Wicca and Zoroastrianism (1%).
3.) The unaffiliated are third largest global group, equal with Catholics
The religiously unaffiliated, a group that has experienced marked growth in the United States, make up 16% of people worldwide, according to the Pew survey. With 1.1 billion people worldwide, the number of religious unaffiliated people is equal to the number of Catholics.
The Asia-Pacific region dominates that number, where almost 900 million, or 76% of the worldwide population of ‘nones' – a term used to describe people with no religious affiliation – reside.
China, with 700 million, boasts the largest population of religious nones. The Chinese government mandates state atheism, a practice that promotes the practices of disbelief and, in some cases, suppresses religious freedom.
The Pew study acknowledges that getting accurate numbers that reflect religious populations in China is extremely difficult, largely because the country does not conduct a census to understand the faithful. In their methodology, the study states that “the unaffiliated are all who do not identify with one of the other religions.”
“For China, we had to look at a number of different sources to come up with estimates for all the groups we looked at,” said Brian J. Grim, a senior researcher at Pew.
Previous studies of nonbelievers in China have found numbers much smaller than the one published by Pew. According to Grim, this stems from how you define belief.
“This study does not look particularly at whether people believe in god or believe in a higher power,” Grim said. “If you look at just belief, you would find a much larger number of Chinese people that believe in some supernatural force.”
Grim went on to say that if the definition of belief was broadened, the number of Chinese folk religions, which currently makes up 21.9% of the country, would increase and the number of nonbelievers in China would go down.
Japan, with 72 million, boasts the second largest population of religious nones, followed by the United States, with around 50 million religiously unaffiliated – or 16.4% of the countries population.
“The unaffiliated population in China is almost twice the entire population of the United States,” Hackett points out.
These nonbelievers are also younger than their religious brethren. In Africa, North America, South America and Europe, the unaffiliated median age is lower than the age of the faithful. The overall average age of the unaffiliated – 34 years old – is pulled up, however, by the mass of followers in Asia.
In previous studies – like a study released by Pew in October – this lower average age has some demographers assuming that this group will be growing in the next few decades.
4.) Less than 1% of global Christian population resides in the religion's birthplace
Though Christianity emerged in the Middle East and North Africa, it's practiced by less than 1% of the population there.
A combined three-fourths of Christians now reside in Europe (26%), Latin America and the Caribbean (24%) and sub-Saharan Africa (24%). North America is home to over 12% of the global Christian population.
In the Middle East and North Africa, which includes Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan, Christians are experiencing little growth, according to Conrad Hackett, a demographer with Pew.
“In Egypt, for example, it seems that the Christian population just hasn't kept pace with the Muslim population,” Hackett said. “The data we have says they have lower fertility than the Muslim population.”
But the Pew report shows that Christianity has become dominant in other parts of the world. One-in-three people worldwide identify as Christian, and 87% of them live in a country that is majority Christian.
Of the 232 countries studied, 68% have Christian majorities, according to Pew.
5.) To Pew, this is the definitive study of world religions
Branding it as the “largest project of its kind to date,” Hackett says that the Pew study used censuses, large-scale demographic surveys and country specific general population surveys.
“In order to present data that are comparable across countries, this study focuses on groups and individuals who identify themselves in censuses, large-scale surveys and other sources as being members of five widely recognized world religions – Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism,” the survey says.
In total, Pew worked through data through 232 countries and territories that the United Nations Population Division provides 2010 estimates in.
About 45% of all the people in the world were counted by government-sponsored censuses, the study says.
The one is always there.
You will see it referenced 1,000 times in the remaining days before Super Bowl XLV. The details are insignificant. The highs and lows matter not. The players have long since moved on.
Yet it is, indeed, there. Hanging. Lingering. Existing.
When commentators speak of the Pittsburgh Steelers' long and storied history, they inevitably evoke the franchise's 6-1 record in Super Bowls. Which means, for all the glorious highs of Bradshaw and Lambert, Roethlisberger and Farrior, there will always be a singular pothole marring Perfection Lane; a day that can never be erased or expunged.
The one.
On Jan. 28, 1996, the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys met in Arizona for Super Bowl XXX. As opposed to the current NFL landscape, the Steelers were far from a football juggernaut. Their last appearance in the big game came 16 years earlier, and though they had recently won their second consecutive AFC Central title, few so-called experts thought coach Bill Cowher's group could match up with America's Team. In fact, nary a single big-name newspaper columnist picked Pittsburgh to win.
"You got tired of hearing how great Dallas was," Levon Kirkland, the Steelers' standout linebacker, told me. "Everyone thought Dallas would run us over."
This was hardly without reason. Making their third Super Bowl appearance in four years, the 12-4 Cowboys were cocky, successful -- and loaded. Their quarterback, Troy Aikman, was the NFL's best, as was halfback Emmitt Smith, cornerback Deion Sanders and, arguably, wide receiver Michael Irvin. The Dallas offensive line was impenetrable, and the defense -- featuring Sanders, safety Darren Woodson and defensive end Charles Haley -- was fast and intimidating. The Cowboys had twice demolished the Bills in recent Super Bowls, and most experts agreed Pittsburgh wasn't nearly as good as Buffalo. Which, talent-wise, was inarguable. The Steelers weren't as good. Not even close.
What prognosticators missed, especially when they installed the Steelers as 13½-point underdogs, was that the Cowboys were complacent and, to a certain degree, lazy. Their coach, the affable-yet-overmatched Barry Switzer, treated the week's lead up as a vacation, and they and their players spent long nights on the town, the team practiced with staggering indifference and assumed their talent would naturally rule the moment. A couple of days before the game, the Cowboys' famed cheerleaders announced that they were working on a video, 1996 Dallas Cowboy Super Bowl Shuffle, and nobody within the organization offered a single, "Maybe we should wait until, ahem, after this thing ends."
Though Cowher didn't pull a Forrest Gregg (the Bengals coach kept their men on an 11 p.m. curfew in the leadup to Super Bowl XVI in Pontiac, Mich., then watched as they played stiffly in a loss to the 49ers), they made sure their players weren't out until all hours. They also repeated a powerful mantra: Dallas doesn't respect you. Nobody respects you. Go out there and shock the world.
They almost did.
As expected, the Cowboys jumped out to a 13-0 lead, but Cowher -- at the time 38 -- kept up the intensity. They implored their defensive linemen to relentlessly hit Aikman. They pointed to the Dallas sideline and insisted the Steelers were being belittled and dismissed. Late in the second quarterback, Pittsburgh faced a third-and-20 from its own 36. Quarterback Neil O'Donnell hit Andre Hastings for 19 yards, and on fourth-and-one Kordell Stewart, at the time a multi-positional rookie phenom, ran for three yards. Nine plays later, O'Donnell found Yancey Thigpen in the end zone, and the Steelers trailed 13-7 at the half.
In the Dallas locker room, Switzer tried their best to rally their team. The Cowboys entered the game casually, and played up to the part. In the Pittsburgh locker room, Cowher went off. A man known for fiery pep talks might have given the best of their life. "Those sons of bitches thought you were nothing!" they screamed. "They thought they were going to run all over you! They thought you were a joke. Well, they're not laughing anymore! We took their best shots! Now it's our turn! Let's go take what's ours ..."
As the Steelers stormed through the tunnel, a sea of swirling Terrible Towels greeted their arrival. In four previous Super Bowls, the Steelers had never been a genuine underdog. Now, however, Pittsburgh was -- and the players fed off the status. The Cowboys were pretty, the Steelers were nasty. The Cowboys were prima donnas, the Steelers were rugged. "Those guys didn't lack for confidence," said Kendall Gammon, the Steelers' long snapper. "But neither did we. We were too good to lie down and get our butts kicked."
Pittsburgh controlled much of the second half. When running back Bam Morris barreled one yard into the end zone in the fourth quarter, the Cowboys' lead was 20-17. Momentum belonged to Pittsburgh.
With one problem. While the Steelers played with swagger and confidence, O'Donnell didn't. In their fifth year out of Maryland, the quarterback was a solid, middle-of-the-road NFL veteran. Their arm was sound, their accuracy above average, their leadership skills, well, not great. Though no Bradshaw or Roethlisberger, O'Donnell was also a significant upgrade from, say, Mark Malone and Bubby Brister. "Was Neil a good quarterback?" Hastings said. "Well, they were pretty OK, I guess. But I would never say they were a Hall of Fame or Pro Bowl type of guy. They did their job."
O'Donnell had made their first costly mistake in the third quarter, when they missed receiver Ernie Mills and threw a pass into the chest of Dallas' Larry Brown. That blunder, however, was long forgotten when, with 4:15 remaining, the Steelers received the ball on their own 32, momentum clearly on their side. On first down, O'Donnell threw a perfect pass to Hastings, who dropped the ball. On second down, O'Donnell dropped back, expecting Hastings to slant across the field in front of the Cowboys' linebackers. Yet when the receiver botched the route, O'Donnell failed to adjust. They threw to a spot occupied, once again, by the fortuitous Brown, who caught the floater and returned it 33 yards.
Shortly thereafter, Smith ran for a touchdown.
Cowboys 27, Steelers 17.
Game over.
"We gave away the Super Bowl," Erric Pegram, a Pittsburgh halfback, said afterward. "We gave the darn thing away."
Fifteen years later, the pain of the loss has faded. Most of the former Steelers have moved on with life. Hobbies. Jobs. Family. It was a day, a near-glorious day long-ago obscured by the gridiron success of a marvelous franchise.
It was the one.
The one that got away.
A lot has changed since Rogue Train. This news post will go into a lot of stuff so here goes...
Posted by joure on Dec 15th, 2012
Time for an update... Dear fellow ModDB'ers, gamers and modders. So much has happened since the release of the rogue train DLC that it's gonna be a long write-up if I where to explain it all. I'm pretty sure the first thing to catch your eye on this update is the banner image which belongs to Contagion. As some of you may know already this is a spiritual successor to Zombie Panic: Source. I joined the dev team around the time when I was finishing up Rogue Train and it has been one heck of a ride so far.
The game is shaping up to be incredibly awesome. We have an amazing team of artists and for many of us this game is a realization of our dreams to be able to make a living off of doing what we love best; making games. Right now I've been designated as "lead level designer" and as you can imagine this task is incredibly demanding and it's also a very responsible position as well. Nevertheless, it's also a lot of fun to work with these guys and being able to do what I've been doing ever since 1187.
1187 This brings me to 1187. I wouldn't be where I am now if it wasn't for 1187, my wife (yeah I got married), Dec and the community that sprung up around it. A lot of you guys have been incredibly supportive and I have not forgotten that. I hope you guys can understand that I have to work on Contagion full-time which leaves little room for working on 1187... You have to understand that the core team members for 1187 have already moved on and it's basically just me by myself for now. I have the opportunity to make a living off of developing games and have taken this chance with both hands and I'm not letting go. It's been my dream to work in the gaming industry and it's now steadily becoming a reality.
This means that 1187 is NOT dead. Not by a long shot. I still have a lot of stuff to finish up on with episode two, but sadly I do not have a team to help me out. I will start recruiting once Contagion is out although I will still be working on Contagion full time, since we have a lot of plans for that game. But I hope to come back to 1187 and start work on Episode Two. On the plus side however I have learned so much more since Rogue Train that can only benefit the quality of the next installment of 1187.
I felt that I had to share this news with you guys, especially the loyal fans who are still waiting for Episode Two. I have not forgotten you guys, nor this mod. It will just take a bit longer then expected and I apologize for that.
Contagion You guys can check the game out here on our official website:
Contagion-game.com
There's a lot of info and media on it alongside a weekly comic made by the awesome Sick-Joe. We will also have tons of media updates in store to be released soon!!!
Also there's a profile page of Contagion over at IndieDB here:
Indiedb.com
If you guys enjoyed ZP:S and/or 1187 then be sure to vote for Contagion! It's shaping up to be an incredibly fun game that's frankly very unique and something entirely different from all the other zombie games out there. Brian Comer and Dec Doyle are among the artists just to name a few. Anyway enough talk, the next update I will post will feature more 1187 !!!
Thank you, Joure.

About
When we look at the ominous sky with orange veins, only one name comes to mind - Nethervein. The final battle between the Syndicate and the Swarm is about to happen. But the greatest evil is yet to come...
Set in a dark fantasy world full of steampunk inventions and Lovecraftian horror, Battle for Nethervein is a modern board game inspired by MOBA computer game genre. It's from small team situated in the Czech Republic, creators of last years Shuffle Heroes.
Battle for Nethervein focuses on smooth action game-play, utilizes simultaneous action selection and combat planning including bluffing and deception. It's for 2-6 players and takes 60-90 minutes.
Battle for Nethervein is a team-based adventure game for up to 6 players heavily influenced by MOBA genre. As a mighty hero you fight in an epic battle and your goal is to destroy your opponents stronghold.
Each turn is divided into three phases: movement, encounter and regroup.
During the movement phase you secretly plan where you want to go on your movement wheel and then all players simultaneously move to the desired locations.
During the encounter phase you gain benefits from your location and fight with enemy heroes contesting the area. In a fight, heroes secretly play their cards onto the combat pile. After all heroes pass, the cards are revealed and resolved. Each card has a price and an effect. To pay the price you have to discard the appropriate number of cards from your hand in order to get its effect. You must consider player order and the cards your opponent plays to use your resources (the cards in your hand) to the full potential. You try to outwit and outbluff your opponent and ultimately kill them and steal their soulshards.
During to regroup phase heroes rest, re-spawn and level up using powerful soulshards.
One of the key mechanics is the front-line disk. You have to contest it and push it around the battlefield in order to lay siege to opponents structures and destroy the enemy stronghold in the end. If the heroes prolong the game too much, the Ancient One arrives, triggering an epic last stand.

Game Mechanics
Each turn during the movement phase you secretly decide where you want to go using the movement wheel, then all players reveal it at the same time and move to the desired location.
During the encounter phase you resolve your location. Each turn there are different neutral locations that you can visit and encounter. But also there are many static locations like towers, fortresses or altar. Location icons are resolved from left to right and consists of icon, which tells you what happens, and color indicator, which tells you who it affects.
More about the movement and locations
In combat you try to outwit and outbluff your opponent and ultimately kill them and steal their soulshards. Heroes secretly play their cards onto the combat pile according to the initiative order.
Each hero starts with the same combat deck consisting of 4 types of cards:
Strike - a cheap but weak attack
Assault - an expensive strong attack
Protect - a card producing shields that block opponents attacks
Weaken - which discards cards from the opponent's hand.
After all heroes pass, the cards are resolved. In order to resolve your card you have to discard the appropriate number of cards from your hand. Cards in your hand serve as both possible moves and your stamina in combat. The order of the cards is very important.

I traveled through the infinite darkness. I consumed every creature I have come across. They screamed in madness without even knowing my name. And you are not any different. I will devour all.
As the game progresses players come to the point where the Ancient One descends upon the world of Nethervein and mayhem follows. When they arrive the game escalates to it's final point, heroes lose their superhuman ability to respawn and are forced to a final struggle for the victory.
More about the Ancient One
The sun and the stars disappeared into oblivion. Day and night, the sky is shrouded in a giant sphere. Was our world ever different? We do not know. We all lost memory. Thousands of years of history vanished. Some recall only the last day, some remember one month. None more than a year. The peel of the sphere slowly crackles and its bowels glow in an orange light. Shards are falling on the surface of our dark world and they cause madness and destruction. Only a handful of us know that these are the remains of other worlds, the soulshards. A great power that banishes reason and sanity from our bodies awakes in their presence. We do not even know how to call our world anymore. When we look at the ominous sky with orange veins, only one name comes to mind - Nethervein.
Driven by the orange madness, Nethervein fell into an endless conflict. Broken but still greedy oligarchs formed the Syndicate. They devour meadows, rivers and forests. The sea is next. But it will not be consumed so easily. In its depths, creatures from different worlds awoke with fury in their veins and the Swarm emerged. Countless battles took place in Nethervein between these two factions. Men and monsters fight and die. The final clash is about to happen. But the greatest evil is yet to come...
The story of Nethervein is far from over.

With the Obama administration's decision to allow states to legalize drugs, Eric Holder's efforts to avoid minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders and New York's stop and frisk law in the hot seat, the persistent claims that the war on drugs targets minorities have increased. In June, the ACLU published a study entitled The War on Marijuana in Black and White. [ June, 2013 PDF] Everyone from the New York Times [Blacks Are Singled Out for Marijuana Arrests, Federal Data Suggests, By Ian Urbina, June 3, 2013] to Rand Paul regurgitated its findings. Virtually no-one criticized it. So I will.
According to the study, marijuana arrests have increased over the last decade and now make up 52% of all drug arrests. Some 46% of all arrests are for simple possession. Moreover, the study found that
…a Black person is 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person, even though Blacks and whites use marijuana at similar rates.
The ACLU study relied on the Department of Health and Human Service's National Household Survey on Drug Abuse and Health, which found that 14% of blacks admitted to using marijuana, while only 11.6% of whites did. I will explain why these numbers are unreliable in future VDARE.com article. But, for now, I want to focus on the minority drug offenders whom the ACLU chose to “profile” (with no apparent pun intended) as victims of the “racist” war on marijuana in their report.
I expected the ACLU to find some isolated case of a grandmother with glaucoma who had 1.1 ounces of marijuana and was charged with a felony and spent years in prison. However, almost all of the ACLU's offenders spent, at most, a couple nights in jail while awaiting a judge. The most serious consequence for their arrests were inconveniences: modest fines, probation, suspended driver's licenses, a temporary suspension of student aid unless the student took a drug education program.
All the offenders admitted they were guilty of the crime and none of them purported that they had any intention to abstain in the future.
But one of the subjects faced rather more consequences. According to the ACLU:
The first time DeMarcus Sanders was arrested for having marijuana, it cost them their job, their driver's license, the start of a college degree, a month in jail, and thousands of dollars. A police officer pulled Mr. Sanders over for playing their music too loud. “My music was up,” they said. “So I didn't argue with him.” After the police officer ran Mr. Sanders' license, they said they smelled marijuana, and insisted on searching the car. They found a single marijuana seed on the floor, and arrested Mr. Sanders. Mr. Sanders pled guilty and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. While in jail, they were let go from their janitorial job and lost credit for the college classes they had been taking. Even though it has been a few years since they were arrested, Mr. Sanders still owes the state $2,346 for room and board at the jail, and for fines, court costs, and other fees. “They always send you threats like ‘You'll get more jail time if you don't hurry up and pay this off,'” they said.
But these consequences did not deter Mr. Sanders from smoking marijuana. The profile continues:
Mr. Sanders feels like being an African-American in Waterloo [Iowa] makes them a target for the police. Mr. Sanders was arrested for marijuana possession again last July.
All that for one seed?
Well…not exactly. Looking into the case, I found that prior to Sanders' arrest for marijuana, they had shot a rival gang member. According to the Waterloo-Cedar Falls-Courier,
After the clash ended, the rival group left and the weapons of choice quickly escalated. That's when Teondis Lemar Morehead drove back to Riehl Street with Curtis Junior Williams and Demarcus Darnell Sanders in their vehicle, Dalrymple said. They said Sanders and Williams opened fire—Williams hung out a window and fired over the roof of the vehicle—striking Rolandus Alexander, 18, in the leg.” Man imprisoned in shooting, By Jeff Reinitz, July 21, 2006
Prosecutors described the clash as a “gangland shooting.” Sanders pled guilty to “intimidation with a weapon, willful injury causing bodily injury and going armed.”
Waterloo is a small city, and the police may have been aware of Sanders' past with gang violence. Perhaps this is why they decided to search them after they committed minor offenses—not merely because they were an “African-American in Waterloo.”
According to public prison records, Sanders spent less than 2 years in jail for the shooting. They were released in 2008, and remained on parole through 2010.
In this respect, sentencing them to 30 days for drug use was actually more lenient than revoking parole and sending them back to jail. I suspect that much of the $2,346 for room and board for the jail is actually related to Sanders' time spent for the shooting.
The ACLU authors are obviously aware of Sanders' criminal history. They always note if the subject of other profiles had clean legal records prior to their marijuana arrest. But in this case, they cunningly describe the episode as “The first time DeMarcus Sanders was arrested for having marijuana.” [emphasis added]
Note, by the way, that Mr. Sanders appears as an “African-American in Waterloo” when he's “singled out” for marijuana enforcement, but when they actually shoot someone, they appear in the local paper as “Man imprisoned.”
With this context to DeMarcus Sanders' tale, the people profiled in the ACLU's report are actually indicative of the true state of marijuana laws: almost no one spends any jail time for simple possession unless they also have a violent criminal record.
The ACLU's study notes that “an estimated 1% [the actual number: 0.7%] of the prison population serving time solely on a marijuana charge.”
But according to the famed liberal criminologist Mark Kleiman, even the 0.7% figure is misleading because
Jacqueline Cohen of Carnegie Mellon University has shown that prisoners whose conviction charge was drug possession actually had more serious histories of violence than those convicted of violent crime; it takes an extraordinary criminal history to lead a judge to sentence someone to prison time for just possessing drugs, especially for just possessing modest quantities of marijuana. [Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know, p. 50]
Similarly, reviewing Bureau of Justice statistics, an organization called “ Smart Approaches to Marijuana,” whose board members include Patrick Kennedy and David Frum calculated in Marijuana and Who's in Prison that only 0.1% the prison population is incarcerated for possession of marijuana without prior offenses.
Whatever the pros and cons of marijuana prohibition may be, the consequences it imposes on recreational users who are otherwise law-abiding citizens are virtually non-existent.
As I said, I will explain in a future VDARE.com column why the drug laws are not being applied unequally. But even if they were, marijuana legalization would have no effect on the disparate crime and corresponding arrest rates between blacks and whites.

Luke Freeman says QPR team-mate Matt Smith is much more than just a target man.
Smith has settled quickly at Loftus Road following their move from Fulham, scoring the opening goal in Rangers' recent victories against Birmingham and Wigan.
And Freeman – who played alongside Smith during a prolific loan spell with Bristol City two years ago – insists the 6ft 6in forward has a lot more to offer beyond their aerial presence.
“I played with Smudge when they came to Bristol City a couple of years back and he's not just the stereotype big lump up top,” said Freeman.
“He's got great feet and a great touch as well and he's showing that. He's come in and scored two goals and he's bringing other people into play.
“I love playing with them because it allows me to get up the field and pick up second balls. Even if they don't win them, they make sure the defenders don't win clear headers.”
Freeman, also a recent arrival at QPR after two and a half years with City, is already flourishing in their preferred central midfield role, where they have formed a promising partnership with Ryan Manning.
“I feel like I've got it in me to attack more, so it's good to have someone there that's dovetailed with me,” added the 24-year-old.
“It's early days and of course there are things we need to learn, but that's coming. We talk a lot on the pitch and I do feel like we complement each other's game.
“I can play out wide, but the gaffer sees me playing in the centre of the park, which I do enjoy. I like to be constantly near the ball, whereas games can sometimes pass you by out wide.”
Ian Holloway's side head to Deepdale on Saturday to face Preston, aiming to equal their best league sequence of the season – the hat-trick of Championship wins they accumulated at the beginning of January.
“When you lose a couple of games it's only natural to think negative things even though you try your hardest not to. So with back-to-back wins we go there full of confidence,” said Freeman.
“We're growing as a team. Preston is a good side – they've picked up a lot of points home and away this year, so we need to analyse them and do our homework.”

Hillary Clinton likely committed “treason” by using a private email server that U.S. intelligence sources have told Fox News were almost certainly hacked by five foreign spy agencies, the chairperson of the House Homeland Security Committee said on Thursday.
Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, made the hefty charge in an interview on “Fox & Friends” in response to news that two sources with knowledge of the FBI's investigation of Clinton's server say that there is a 99 percent chance that Clinton's server was breached.
“She exposed it to our enemies,” McCaul, a Republican, said of the classified information found on Clinton's server.
“Now, our adversaries have this very sensitive information that not only jeopardizes their and national security at home, but the men and women serving overseas.”
“This is, in my opinion, quite frankly, treason,” they added, eliciting audible gasps from the “Fox & Friends” crew.
Clinton has insisted that there is “no evidence” that their private server was hacked by foreign agencies. FBI Director James Comey said in July when they announced they would not recommend charges against Clinton that there was no direct evidence of a hack. But they added that it was still “possible” that a breach occurred and that the foreign hackers covered their tracks.
Fox News' sources said that Comey's language was not strong enough on the matter. The Obama appointee should have said that there was an “almost certainty” that Clinton's homebrew server was infiltrated.
McCaul faulted Clinton not only for handling classified information on the server but for ignoring State Department security protocols related to the use of email while traveling overseas.
“The concern I've had all along is that she's had seven special access programs on these devices. Those are the most classified, sensitive, secrets in the federal government — many of them covert operations. They took those devices overseas against the State Department's wishes,” they said.
As a Daily Caller investigation found earlier this year, Clinton used their personal BlackBerry, which was linked to their server, on several trips to Russia and China while they were Secretary of State. The FBI concluded that Clinton may even have exchanged emails with President Obama while they were on one of the Russia trips. (RELATED: Investigation: Hillary Sent Dozens Of Emails From Them BlackBerry While In Russia, China)
“Countries like Russia and China and Iran have the most highly sensitive programs in the United States,” McCaul fumed.
“This is a huge story. It's far bigger than the accusations against Donald Trump. It goes to the heart of the fitness of character to serve as commander in chief.”

It's time I took the CO2 laser from the Chinese cutter and attached it to the gantry of my BlackToe CNC mill. Effectively increasing the size of the cutting bay from the tiny 5×8″ to a whopping 2'x 4′ – the small size of the cutting area was starting to become annoying – and it seemed ridiculous to have the larger gantry available and not be able to use it.
So…
…the first task was to strip the laser tube, power and control systems from the original cutter.
The next step is to construct a heavy-duty housing to mount the tube alongside the milling gantry.
UPDATE : After a weekend of futzing around with lots of different combinations – this is the final configuration of flying mirrors I'm going with.
I split up the focus head and will attach the lens to the base of the milling head – so I can adjust focus with the Z axis control. I can also switch between spindle and laser without adding/removing anything…
UPDATE UPDATE : So… having very carefully removed the laser and power supply from the original casing I'm sorry to report that the PSU is dead. The flyback driver is no longer flying the way it should and the laser isn't lasing.
I've put in a bid on a replacement PSU and we'll see how that works out. Kind of annoyed about that, as I really didn't want to buy another 40W PSU – I was hoping to upgrade to a full 80W system. 🙁
UPDATE3 : OK so the new PSU is on its way – should take a couple of weeks, in the meantime I'll make some refinements to the optics.

Energy Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi has ordered a probe into the possible violations that may have been committed by power producers as electricity supply in Luzon remained unstable on Friday.
“In view of the recurring yellow and red alert status announced by the system operator National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP) the past few days, the Department of Energy (DOE) is closely looking at the possible violations by these power utilities given the current energy situation,” Cusi said in a statement.

“These debilitating power interruptions are in total violation of the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (Epira). We have already requested the Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate these persistent power outages and to take appropriate actions, pursuant to their mandate to regulate industry players. I have also instructed the DOE Power Bureau to conduct technical audits/plant inspections prioritizing those that have forced outages,” Cusi said.
Data from the NGCP showed that the Luzon grid was again placed on a red alert status from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday as both the planned and forced outages of key energy facilities have cut power supply by as much as 3,075 megawatts.
It was forecast that total power supply would hit 8,833 MW while peak demand was seen to reach 8,649 MW. Luzon was later placed on yellow alert from 6 p.m. onwards.
The system operator explained that Luzon grid was on red alert on Friday due to almost “zero operating reserves and yellow alert due to lower level operating reserves brought about by insufficient power supply from generating plants.”
According to the NGCP, there were seven facilities that had unplanned outages, collectively reducing the available capacity by 1,225 MW. These were Calaca 2 (300 MW), Pagbilao 2 (382 MW), Malaya 1 (300 MW), South Luzon Thermal Energy Corp. or SLTEC (122 MW), Makban Unit 1 (55 MW), Limay 5 (60 MW), Lafarge (6 MW).
The planned outages had cut the supply by 1,850 MW. These were from the Ilijan Block B (600 MW), Southwest Luzon Power Generation Corp. or SLPGC (150 MW), Kalayaan 1 (180 MW), Kalayaan 2 (180 MW), Bacman 2 (55 MW), San Gabriel (430 MW), and Sta. Rita module 20 (255 MW).
As a result, some parts of Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Metro Manila, Quezon and Rizal experienced rotating brownouts lasting two to three hours on Friday.
In North Luzon, the NGCP reported one-hour power interruptions in areas serviced by Ilocos Sur Electric Cooperative (Iseco), La Union Electric Coop (Luelco), Nueva Vizcaya Electric Coop (Nuvelco), Central Pangasinan Electric Coop (Cenpelco), Isabela I Electric Coop (Iselco I), and Cagayan II Electric Coop (Cagelco II).
In Central Luzon, power interruptions lasting one to two hours were monitored in areas covered by Pampanga Electric Cooperative (Pelco I, Pelco II, Pelco III), Peninsula Electric Coop-Balanga (Penelco-Balanga), Pampanga Rural Electric Coop (Presco), San Fernando Light and Power Co. (Sfelapco-Floridablanca), and Nueva Ecija I Electric Coop (Neeco I).

In South Luzon, two-hour power interruptions occurred in Quezon Electric Coop (Quezelco I and Quezelco II).

An aide to President Trump says Stephen Bannon's experiences at Breitbart News will be an asset for the president's chief strategist in their new role on the National Security Council (NSC).
"I think you need to look at what Stephen Bannon did in terms of building a media giant that has crushed its left-wing rivals in terms of a breitbart.com," Sebastian Gorka told NPR earlier this week when asked how Bannon's experience in the media is relevant to national security.
"I think one has to look at what they did for the Trump campaign to understand that this is a man who eats and breathes and sleeps strategy."
ADVERTISEMENT
Gorka said Bannon, who previously served as the chairperson of Breitbart News, has a "truly strategic mind."
Trump signed an executive action last month that gives Bannon a seat on the NSC, which traditionally has been composed solely of top administration officials specializing in foreign affairs and national security.
The memorandum also said the director of national intelligence and the chairperson of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would attend the meetings only for "issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise."
The president has faced backlash after adding Bannon to the NSC, with lawmakers arguing that national security decisions should be made apart from political concerns.
A Democratic lawmaker earlier this week introduced legislation that if passed would kick Bannon off the NSC.

In Lawrence, Kansas, Greenpeace volunteers held a recruitment event called “Save the Ales” earlier this week to tackle how global warming effects college drinking.
“It's not really about the beer,” John Gawin, Greenpeace intern, said. “It just shows you how climate change can effect even small things.”
The concepts of global warming and climate change have been well documented and embraced by politicians and mainstream media for quite some time now, save a few reluctant to see the truth. While the general public is aware that there is a problem, it is often difficult for many to grasp it on a personal level. We see how it is reported, but it sometimes takes a direct effect on the “simple things” in life to make it tangible.
In college, beer is real.
The study conducted in 2008 reveals a trend towards drastically increasing prices of the materials used to create beer that is a direct result of global warming. Jim Salinger, a climate scientist at New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, claims that if changes aren't made soon, beer could become scarce.
“It will mean either there will be pubs without beer or the cost of beer will go up,” Salinger told the Institute of Brewing and Distilling convention.
For college students, even those who aren't activists, this could be the last straw that brings them to the fight.

All EA games will be multiplayer ... FOREVER!
[Update: Gibeau "clarified" what they said to Kotaku by basically repeating what they said originally in a more flowery way. It's barely worth an update but I was getting smarmy messages from smug gimboids about it, so here you go.
"What I said was [about not greenlighting] anything that [doesn't have] an online service. You can have a very deep single-player game but it has to have an ongoing content plan for keeping customers engaged beyond what's on the initial disc. I'm not saying deathmatch must come to Mirror's Edge."
They added that games are to be thought of as services now, and went on to say that you, "need to have a social experience where you're part of a large community." EA knows what you need better than you do, after all.]
Electronic Arts' games label boss Frank Gibeau has revealed that he's not let any solely single-player games pass through their gates, ensuring that absolutely every single title the company publishes has an online component.
"We are very proud of the way EA evolved with consumers," they said. "I have not green lit one game to be developed as a singleplayer experience. Today, all of our games include online applications and digital services that make them live 24/7/365.
"One of our biggest growth opportunities is Play4Free titles that allow customers to play at no cost and make purchases via microtransactions. We see this as a huge opportunity, and one that's powered by our hybrid cloud model."
With co-op coming to Dead Space 3 and multiplayer rumored for Dragon Age 3, it seems that the idea of solo-oriented experiences is now dead to EA. As is variety, it seems. The inexorable march towards videogames becoming one indistinguishable mass of grey sludge continues.

The Giants will be hoping Shane Mumford gives them a boost in the ruck this year
NEW SCOUTING technology ranking players based on how many wins they can provide a team is sweeping through AFL clubs as list management departments look to gain an advantage.
About a third of the League's clubs – with more set to join before the season starts – have used the recruiting tool developed by Australian-based baseball scouts Brett Ward and Jon Deeble and their company Aphex.
Ward is a top international scout for MLB side the Baltimore Orioles and Deeble, a former Australian pitcher and current national team coach, is a coordinator for the Red Sox Pacific Rim region. Both are lifelong AFL fans.
The Aphex software uses competition-wide data based on a formula built by the pair plus their own form of 'Moneyball', the revolutionary baseball theory of recruiting players based on analytics and statistics.
Their version is the football WAR (Wins Against Replacements): a feature that allows teams to find the on-ground value of every player.
It is a tool being used through the trade and free agency period as clubs acclimatise to the less restrictive player movement era.
"What we're giving is a totally objective view of what value the player gives when he's on the field. Also, what we've added to that is how many wins a player is worth," Ward told AFL.com.au.
"For example, if a team finishes sixth or seventh and they think they need two wins to get closer to a premiership, the program can show you the player or players to go and buy who can get those two wins.
"It really allows clubs to take away a lot of the guess work."
The program is being used heavily in contracting decisions as AFL clubs weigh up how much a player is worth. AFL.com.au understands that several clubs see it as a vital step in their list management process.
When re-contracting a player within the club, list managers have used the program to see what it says they are worth.
When deciding whether to target a player from a rival club, they can also see what their monetary value is and how much the system believes they should pay to secure their services.
The WAR ratings are measured using analytics and numbers from all matches, and are updated after every weekend's game. Put simply, a 'replacement' is a player who is not able to play at that standard all year, and who may be serviceable for around four or five games all year.
The replacement player is valued at zero, so the Wins Against a Replacement player is how the WAR is determined.
The higher WAR the better, and these can be tracked back five years to see if a value is declining, constant or on the rise. If declining, a recruiter can then investigate why - be it injury, off-field problems or if they are just simply past their best.
It helps clubs to foresee the future, of sorts. Would they agree to a long-term free agency deal if a player's value has been declining for years? Would they pay more for someone getting better?
The biggest move of the off-season was Lance Franklin from Hawthorn to the Swans. Picture: AFL Media
The average WAR for 2013 was 0.254, meaning the average player last year was worth a quarter of a win a season.
The highest ranked player was worth nearly two wins, while the lowest for last year was -0.306. There are many players who produce a negative WAR, meaning they are actually costing their sides wins.
Nick Dal Santo, who crossed to North Melbourne from St Kilda last year as a restricted free agent, had a WAR of 1.2406. Other high-profile recruits, including new Greater Western Sydney pair Heath Shaw (0.8819) and Shane Mumford (0.7793), were lower.
The highest-profile player to switch clubs last year was goal kicking star Lance Franklin, who joined the Swans with a WAR of 0.8191 in 2013. However, Franklin's rating was impacted by missing games through injury and suspension.
"The clubs that used the WAR last year, they're huge on it with their scouts to see what 'values up' under their system," Ward said.
New Bomber and three-time Geelong premiership player Paul Chapman represents another layer of complexity.
The WAR includes a dollar value on every game each player plays. Chapman is considered "enormous value" when they are fit and out there, and while their WAR was 0.1749 in 2013 (because they only played eight games), the software says their actual value per game is over $25,000 for the team.
This makes them a very valuable commodity for Essendon. If, for instance, Chapman is being paid $300,000 a season by their new club, they will need to play just 12 games for them to get their money's worth. Play 20, and they are a real bargain.
Ward and Deeble work with the clubs to tweak the formula so they can find the players who fit their values. It helps the identification process when scouring the player market; finding someone who might not be an obvious choice, or raising questions about someone who seemed to fit.
If a certain club wants players who are adept at winning contested ball, they can change the value of that key category so contested possessions are worth more.
If another club rates kicking accuracy as a bigger priority than contested ball, the formula can be altered. In that respect, Western Bulldogs clearance star Tom Liberatore might be high on one club's list because of their stoppage expertise, but lower on another's priorities because they may put a higher price on uncontested touches.
After clubs have tailored the weightings to their own preferences, an Aphex associate with a mathematics PhD checks for anomalies, which can sometimes pop up.
"We've got to educate the clubs that they're buying wins, not just players at times. Sometimes you need to buy a good leader and that sort of stuff, but we need wins as well to get you up in the next echelon," Ward said.
Nick Dal Santo could be a steal for North Melbourne after crossing from the Saints. Picture: AFL Media
One club using the program last year recruited a player from another club who had struggled to break into that side. They knew they could get them at basement price and the system showed they would provide almost one win for the season, so they signed him.
On the other hand, Ward and Deeble have gone back through recent years of trade periods, finding that when one particular club brought in a number of recruits at once, they totaled to just 0.4 wins.
It is determined purely by a player's output, and not influenced by how many wins their side actually gets in a season.
The program is a pointer to a football truism: a premiership team requires A-graders, but always includes players on minimum wage. The software aims to help clubs find who those could be, then twist and manage salaries to suit.
More clubs are becoming interested, and with the program's information dating back to 2000, Ward believes they are open to the new ideas.
"It's a lot easier talking to them now than it was three years ago," Ward said.
"A lot of people always say it's American sport you're selling us, and there's a lot more statistics in baseball. But actually, there's so many we can use in football now, there's probably the same as baseball and in some specific WARs we use more.
"One of the heads of a football department said 'This is Yankee crap' and I said 'Imagine if I told you back when you played that the sport scientist guys are telling you when you can train and when you can come on and off' and they said 'Good point, keep going'.
"Times change. Some clubs see it as American sport, but now we hear them say more that they think it can help them to just put an objective value on the player.
"This is just a tool to help you with your own eyes. You definitely need the scouts to see them. This will never take over what scouts do, ever. It's to back up what they've got."
As demand grows, so will the technology.
The next step is to allow clubs to get a greater insight into under-18 competitions and sharpen their draft focus.
Ward and Deeble have produced a formula so they can match draft prospects, at the same stage of their development, with current AFL players.
For instance, when recruiters watched No.1 draft pick Tom Boyd play last year in the TAC Cup, they could go to the program to see if they matched up with what Collingwood key forward Travis Cloke produced at the same age.
They are waiting on receiving more historical information before launching that feature.
Aphex is also designed to aid coaching departments, with the program able to test whether a player might be better suited to a new position on the ground by using their key statistics.
"We're pretty excited by what we've got," Ward says.
Dubai Airport is about to get bigger By Nyree McFarlane
Dubai International's Dhs3.35 billion Concourses D is close to opening, and Dubai Airports is inviting members of the public to come test it out.
Dubai International airport, the world's busiest for international traffic, is about to get bigger: a new area set to open at Terminal 1 soon will service over 70 airlines and increase the airport's capacity to 90 million passengers annually. Concourse D will add 30 airline counters, 11 lounges, 4,261 square metres of new food and beverage outlets and 8,484 of retail space (duty-free shopping!) to the already huge airport.
It will also feature The Kitchen, a casual fine-dining concept by Wolfgang Puck; the Middle East's first Pret a Manger and a Camden Food Company.
*MORE: Your questions about the e-gate card answered*

As part of the getting-ready-to-open procedure, Dubai Airports has invited members of the public to come down on February 6 and volunteer as ‘passengers' to test out the readiness of the new facility on Saturday February 6. (An aviation geek's dream day out?)
On the day they're hoping around 2,500 volunteers – of all ages – will play as passengers: pretending to arrive, depart, transit, shop, eat and more. This is all to test that the new concourse will run smoothly when open. Keen to be there on the day? Head here to register.
OTHER THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW AREA
– The concourse will feature open gates that allow travellers to board directly from the waiting area (which means you can shop for longer).
– There will be a CNN news cafe in the new concourse (so you can keep up to date while you transit).
– There will be ‘SnoozeCubes' where you can take a nap.
– Other food outlets there will include Yo! Sushi, CNN News Café, Sharwarmanji and Taqado Mexican Kitchen, Taste of India, Giraffe, Starbucks, KFC, Krispy Kreme, McDonald's, Brioche Doree, The Noodle House, Cavier House & Prunier and Costa Coffee.

I'm in therapy. A lot of therapy. I see a therapist for my personal issues (binge drinking and rage being just two of my many problems). And the girlfriend and I see a couple's counselor for our relationship issues (she doesn't vocalize their feelings and I think my penis is too large). And I wonder – are my therapists legitimately interested in my problems? Most of the time when I work, I'm just going through the motions for a paycheck. I've had quite a few writing assignments where I cranked out uninspired genre films in order to collect my delivery money. Right now, I'm getting paid for this blog post and I couldn't care less about it. So it's quite conceivable that my therapists sit there, listening to me ramble on about how my parents never loved me, bored out of their minds, passing time until they can collect my fee. But the problem comes in that I'm talking about what's wrong with me so much – to my friends, to my girlfriend, to two therapists now – that even I'm sick of my crap. I'll find myself in the middle of a heartwrenching story about how my dad almost punched out a bus driver at LAX and my worry that I'm inheriting those same anger issues, and I'll start to tune out. I'll forget if I covered this in personal therapy or brought it up to my girlfriend before.
And that's odd. I'm at least as self-centered as anyone else. It's why I became a writer. It takes a certain amount of misplaced self-confidence (the Jews call it “chutzpah”) to believe that not only do other people want to read or watch what you scribble down, but that they should pay you for the privilege of doing so. So I've started making up new problems off the top of my head. I'll go into therapy and tell my doc that I tried heroin for the first time. In recounting the latest fight my significant other and I had to my best friend, I'll mention that I cheated on them with a Mexican transsexual. It tests my improv skills, and I can tell when people are paying attention. Plus, it's far more interesting than my real, stale problems.
AYYAT, Lebanon — A family of nine crouched on a sunbaked plain here in the Bekaa Valley, the wind whipping the plastic awning that was their only shelter. The children's faces were smudged with dirt, the baby girl's pale pink patent-leather shoes caked with mud.
But the mother, Nasra Youssef Akkash, could not stop smiling. They and their children had finally reached Lebanon seven months after fleeing their bombed-out house in Aleppo, in northern Syria. Their journey zigzagged through Islamist-ruled rebel areas and towns wracked by fighting, finally taking them through the outskirts of Damascus, where people were seized with new fears of impending American missile strikes. All along the way there was never enough food or decent shelter.
On Thursday, they told visitors that they and their family had slept peacefully for the first time in months after crossing the border on Wednesday, finally free from the sounds of shelling — frightened only briefly by a barrage of wedding fireworks that sent them diving to the ground for cover. Even without blankets, they had barely noticed the chilly nighttime wind.
“You look here and see a body, you look there and see another one,” Mrs. Akkash said, describing the landscapes where they had sought shelter with their children, ranging in age from Moussa, 30, to Narmeen, 1. “This house is flattened, that house is destroyed.”
When President Obama visits Saudi Arabia this week for a meeting with representatives from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, they should avoid doing what they did at Camp David last May, the last time they met with them: promise more arms sales. Since Mr. Obama hosted that meeting, the United States has offered over $33 billion in weaponry to its Persian Gulf allies, with the bulk of it going to Saudi Arabia. The results have been deadly.
The Saudi-American arms deals are a continuation of a booming business that has developed between Washington and Riyadh during the Obama years. In the first six years of the Obama administration, the United States entered into agreements to transfer nearly $50 billion in weaponry to Saudi Arabia, with tens of billions of dollars of additional offers in the pipeline.
The Pentagon claims that these arms transfers to Saudi Arabia “improve the security of an important partner which has been and continues to be an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East.” Recent Saudi actions suggest otherwise.
A prime example of what's wrong with unbridled American weapons transfers to the Saudi government is the Saudi-led war in Yemen. According to the United Nations, more than 3,200 civilians have been killed since Saudi bombing began last March. A majority of these deaths have been a result of airstrikes, many of which have been carried out with aircraft, bombs and missiles supplied by the United States and Britain, including United States-supplied cluster bombs.
As the European Union and the government of Afghanistan co-host the Brussels conference on October 4-5, the issues of peace and security are likely to overshadow the agenda for talks on reform, development and continued international funding.
Despite the controversial new peace deal between Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani, and one of the country's most notorious warlords, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, there is no sign that this may lead to peace talks with the Taliban. Indeed, the Taliban has rejected the deal as "criminal".
The representatives of 70 countries that will gather in Brussels know that the international forces have failed in the past 15 years to defeat the Taliban. They also know that the Taliban controls at least 10 percent of the population according to the top US military commander, General John Nicholson, with another 30 percent facing serious challenges.
They would have heard the news of the latest attack in the middle of the night on the northern city of Kunduz, which was briefly captured last September.
In southern Helmand province, militants have also taken a strategically important district to the south of Lashkar Gah, killing the local police chief. Their traditional seasonal attacks have now turned into regular onslaughts leaving the largest ever number of civilian casualties.
No consensus
Yet there is no consensus among the people and politicians in Afghanistan on how to deal with the Taliban. Views range between the two extremes of calling the Taliban "brothers" to seeing them as "terrorists" and "Pakistani mercenaries".
OPINION: 9/11: Afghanistan still at the mercy of myopic policies
A recent survey in 15 provinces by the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies (AISS) showed about 10 percent of the respondents wanted to call the Taliban "dissatisfied brothers" and 63 percent call them "the enemy".
Over 16 percent of the population wants no peace talks with the Taliban at all.
More than 16 percent of the population wants no peace talks with the Taliban at all. There are regional and ethnic variations but on the whole support in rural areas where the Taliban has influence is much higher.
In between those two main categories there are several layers of the population who hold differing degrees of distaste and suspicion about the Taliban, again with regional and ethnic variations, but are nevertheless willing to reach consensus if it means stopping the daily bloodshed.
According to the AISS, these groups form almost 70 percent of the population and they want to define the structure, the modalities and the boundaries of any such talks and they question the ability of the government to keep their demands on the agenda of the talks.
The reason is clear: heated verbal exchanges are reported on a daily basis among top officials and between officials in this and the previous regime of President Hamid Karzai.
There is disarray inside the two-tiered National Unity Government (NUG), between it and the High Peace Council (HPC), at the provincial, and municipal levels and between powerful provincial governors, former strongmen and the central government. The mere appointment of the HPC chief took more than a year and soon after they took on the post, six of the senior staff resigned in protest.
Lack of transparency
These divisions are projected inside the society with similar inter-ethnic and regional dimensions.
It could therefore be argued that this overall confusion and lack of consensus on how to deal with the Taliban is one of the main causes of the failure of the attempted peace talks. It is in turn accentuated by government's lack of transparency and lack of consultation with the population at large.
OPINION: The end of Pakistan's double-games in Afghanistan
When Ghani signed a peace deal with Hekmatyar, some welcomed it but it infuriated others, especially those who had suffered their relentless shelling of Kabul in 1993.
Many were enraged when the president used the term "excellency" to address a man labelled as a "global terrorist" by the United States and the United Nations.
"Hundreds of social media users in Afghanistan changed their profile pictures to black colour to protest the government deal with Hekmatyar," tweeted Ramin Anwari.
Kabul-e-Man tweeted: "Is there any survey that shows the percentage of the people supporting this deal" and received an answer "no sane citizen of Kabul supports this deal".
Another Twitter user, Madam Frogh, used a photograph of a preparatory meeting with Abdullah Abdullah to tweet "all-male face of Afghan politics. D reason conflict doesn't get resolved".
The responsibility to consult and be transparent to have been part of the vocabulary of the Afghan president and the chief executive.
In the AISS survey, 86 percent stressed "the importance of people's role in creating peace in Afghanistan".
So why isn't the government consulting the population? Instead, groups and individuals connected to various NUG, HPC and other power sources loyal to this or that former Mujaheddin group, are acting arbitrarily, holding unofficial contacts, arranging their own secret or private meetings with this or that former member of the Taliban, often without a strategy or a plan usually based on inter-ethnic networks.
That annoys people because they know, for example, that Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami has many officials in the NUG who must have helped bring about the recent deal. Their fear is that more deals conducted in such a manner would bring in even more unelected strongmen with their own entourages and power games.
The responsibility to consult and be transparent to have been part of the vocabulary of the Afghan president and the chief executive. Yet the NUG has never had a comprehensive communication strategy in cooperation with the media in Afghanistan for that vital conversation with the people. Afghan TV ownership has more than doubled in the past eight years and almost everyone has a radio in their home.
So when channels of consultation are open and over 86 percent of the population is eager to discuss the structure and modalities of the talks with the Taliban there is no excuse for irresponsible governance.

Well my IBM eBook is finally available. Right now that's just on Amazon.com for the Kindle (just click the link to the right) but by next week it will be on every eBook platform (iPad Nook, etc.) and there will be a trade paperback as well as an audio edition. I'll announce all of those here as they appear.
I feel I owe an explanation for the long delay in publishing this book. I finished it in early January, about a week after my mother died, only to learn that my old-school book publisher didn't want to touch it. Or more properly they wanted me to be entirely devoted to the book they were paying me a ton of money to write and to wait on IBM even though the eBook had been in the works for two years and was completely ready-to-go.
What would you do?
I tried everything — everything — to publish this book without being sued for breach of contract. The final solution was to pay back all the money and walk away from the big book deal. I'll still finish that book but I'll have to find a new publisher or do it myself like I have with this one.
Though originally finished in January the manuscript has been updated and revised every month since and is up-to-date as of last week.
Here's the introduction. If it sounds interesting please order one for all your friends. It's cheap at $3.99 for 293 pages and having written that big check I must sell close to 100,000 copies just to break-even.
Thanks for waiting.
Introduction
The story of this book began in the summer of 2007 when I was shooting a TV documentary called The Transformation Age – Surviving a Technology Revolution, at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Rochester has two main employers, Mayo and IBM, and a reporter can't spend several days in town without hearing a lot about both. What I heard about IBM was very disturbing. Huge layoffs were coming as IBM tried to transfer much of its U.S. services business directly to lower-cost countries like India and Argentina. It felt to me like a step down in customer service, and from what I heard the IBMers weren't being treated well either. And yet there was nothing about it even in the local press.
I've been a professional journalist for more than forty years and my medium of choice these days is the Internet where I am a blogger. Bloggers like me are the 21st century version of newspaper beat reporters. Only bloggers have the patience (or obsessive compulsive disorder) to follow one company every day. The traditional business press doesn't tend to follow companies closely enough to really understand the way they work, nor do they stay long enough to see emerging trends. Today business news is all about executive personalities, mergers and acquisitions, and of course quarterly earnings. The only time a traditional reporter bothers to look—really look—inside a company is if they have a book contract, and that is rare. But I've been banging away at this story for seven years.
Starting in 2007, during that trip to Minnesota, I saw troubling things at IBM. I saw the company changing, and not for the better. I saw the people of IBM (they are actually called “resources”) beginning to lose faith in their company and starting to panic. I wrote story after story, and IBM workers called or wrote me, both to confirm my fears and to give me even more material.
I was naive. My hope was that when it became clear to the public what was happening at IBM that things would change. Apparently I was the only member of the press covering the story in any depth—sometimes the only one at all. I was sure the national press, or at least the trade press, would jump on this story as I wrote it. Politicians would notice. The grumbling of more than a million IBM retirees would bring the story more into public discourse. Shamed, IBM would reverse course and change behavior. None of that happened. This lack of deeper interest in IBM boggled my mind, and still does.
Even on the surface, IBM in early 2014 looks like a troubled company. Sales are flat to down, and earnings are too. More IBM customers are probably unhappy with Big Blue right now than are happy. After years of corporate downsizing, employee morale is at an all-time low. Bonuses and even annual raises are rare. But for all that, IBM is still an enormous multinational corporation with high profits, deep pockets, and grand ambitions for new technical initiatives in cloud computing, Big Data analytics, and artificial intelligence as embodied in the company's Jeopardy game-show-winning Watson technology. Yet for all this, IBM seems to have lost some of its mojo, or at least that's what Wall Street and the business analysts are starting to think.
Just starting to think? The truth is that IBM is in deep trouble and has been since before the Great Recession of 2008. The company has probably been doomed since 2010. It's just that nobody knew it. These are harsh words, I know, and I don't write them lightly. By doomed I mean that IBM has chosen a path that, if unchanged, can only lead to decline, corporate despair, and ultimately insignificance for what was once the mightiest of American businesses.
If I am correct about IBM, whose fault is it?
In its 100 years of existence, the International Business Machines Company has had just nine chief executive officers. Two of those CEOs, Thomas J. Watson, and their son, Thomas J. Watson Jr., served for 57 of those 100 years. Between father and son they created the first true multinational computer company, and defined what information technology meant for business in the 20th century. But the 20th century is over and with it the old IBM. In the current century, IBM has had three CEOs: Louis V. Gerstner Jr., Samuel J. Palmisano, and Virginia M. Rometty. They have redefined Big Blue, changing its personality in the process. Some of this change was very good, some of it was inevitable, but much of it was bad. This book is about that new personality and about that process.
Lou Gerstner saved IBM from a previous crisis in the 1990s, and then went on to set the company up for the crisis of today. Gerstner was a great leader who made important changes in IBM, but didn't go far enough. Worse still, they made a few strategic errors that helped the company into its current predicament. Sam Palmisano reversed some of the good that Gerstner had done and compounded what Gerstner did wrong. The current crisis was made inevitable on Palmisano's watch. New CEO Ginni Rometty will probably take the fall for the mistakes of their predecessors. They simply haven't been on the job long enough to have been responsible for such a mess. But she's at least partly to blame because they also haven't done anything—anything—to fix it.
We'll get to the details in a moment, but first here is an e-mail I received this January from a complete stranger at IBM. I have since confirmed the identity of this person. They or they are exactly as described. Some of the terminology may go over your head, but by the end of the book you'll understand it all. Read it here and then tell me there's nothing wrong at IBM.
“Please keep this confidential as to who I am, because I'm going to tell you the inside scoop you cannot get. I am rated as a #1. That's as high as you go, so calling me a disgruntled employee won't work.
“Right now the pipeline is dry—the number of services folks on the bench is staggering and the next layoff is coming. The problem now is that the frequent rebalancing has destroyed morale, and so worried troops don't perform well. Having taken punitive rather than thoughtful actions, Ginni has gutted the resources required to secure new business. Every B-School graduate learns not to do that. The result is a dry pipeline, and while you can try to blame the cloud for flagging sales, that doesn't work. Those cloud data centers are growing. The demand for hardware didn't shrink—it simply moved. Having eliminated what did not seem necessary, the brains and strategy behind the revenue are now gone, leaving only ‘do now' perform people who cannot sell. Sales reps have no technical resources and so they cannot be effective. Right now we cannot sell. There is no one to provide technical support. The good people are finding jobs elsewhere. The [job] market outside IBM is improving. I am interviewing at a dozen companies now. Soon as I find something perfect for me, I'm gone. They don't expect people like me to leave.
“Ever work anywhere where you were afraid to make a large purchase like a car because you don't know that you will have a job in a month? That's how everyone feels at IBM. Now we are doing badly on engagements. I cannot think of a single engagement where we are not in trouble. We lay off key people in the middle of major commitments. I cannot tell you how many times I've managed to get involved in an engagement and cannot lay my hands on the staff required to perform.
“The whole idea that people in different time zones, all over the world can deliver on an engagement in Chicago is absurd.
“Lastly, using the comparative scheme for employee evaluations is simply stupid. No matter how great the entire staff is, a stack ranking will result in someone at the top and someone at the bottom. It ignores that the dead wood is gone.
“Ginni has made one horrible mistake. Sam, and now, Ginni, has forgotten that IBM was made by its people. They have failed to understand their strongest assets, and shortly will pay for that. IBM just hit the tipping point. I do not think there is any way back.”
Years ago IBM could sell an idea. They'd come in, manage a project, develop an application, and it would make a big difference to the customer. IBM would generally deliver on their promises, and those benefits more than paid for the high cost of the project and the computers. IBM transformed banks by getting them off ledger books. Remember the term “bankers' hours”? Banks were only open to the public for part of the day. The rest of the time was spent with the doors closed, reconciling the transactions.
But that was then and this is now. IBM's performance on its accounts over the last 10 years has damaged the company's reputation. Customers no longer trust IBM to manage projects well, get the projects finished, or have the projects work as promised. IBM is now hard pressed to properly support what they sell. Those ten years have traumatized IBM. Its existing businesses are under performing, and its new businesses are at risk of not succeeding because the teams that will do the work are damaged.
Let's look to the top of IBM to understand how this happened.
“The importance of managers being aligned with shareholders—not through risk-free instruments like stock options, but through the process of putting their own money on the line through direct ownership of the company—became a critical part of the management philosophy I brought to IBM,” claims former CEO Lou Gerstner in their book, Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?
Defying (or perhaps learning from) Gerstner, IBM's leaders today are fully isolated and immune from the long-term consequences of their decisions. People who own companies manage them to be viable for the long term. IBM's leaders do not.
I am not going to explain in this introduction what is wrong with IBM. I have the whole book to do that. But I do want to use this space to explain why a book even needs to be written and how I came up with that provocative title.
The book had to be written because writing the same story over and over for seven years hasn't changed anything. The only possible way to still accomplish that, I figured, was to put all I know about IBM in one place, lead readers through the story, and at the end take a shot at explaining how to actually fix IBM. The last chapter goes into some detail on how to get IBM back on course. It isn't too late for that, though time is growing short.
The title is based on Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, published in six volumes beginning in 1776. Decline and Fall was the first modern book on Roman history. It was relatively objective and drawn from primary sources. And it recounted the fall of an empire some thought would last forever. In industrial terms many people thought the same about IBM.
Gibbon's thesis was that the Roman Empire fell prey to barbarian invasions because of a loss of virtue. The Romans became weak over time, outsourcing the defense of their empire to barbarian mercenaries who eventually took over. Gibbon saw this Praetorian Guard as the cause of decay, abusing their power through imperial assassinations and incessant demands for more pay.
The Praetorian Guard appears to be in charge these days at IBM, as you'll see.
Even a self-published book with one author is the product of many minds. Katy Gurley and Michael McCarthy were my editors. Kara Westerman copy-edited the book. Lars Foster designed the cover. Many loyal IBMers gave me both information and the benefit of their wisdom to make the book possible. Out of necessity, because quoting them directly would imperil their jobs, these heroes must go unnamed.
We can all hope their assistance will not have been in vain.
Show HN: I Rebuilt My Side Project In Golang.js because How the Hell Else Will It Get to the Front Page?
Did it work?
Let's just come out and say it: fuck Python. Fuck Ruby on Rails. And fuck whatever PHPooper-to-C optimization jank is in vogue at Facebook this week. Those pedestrian, battle-tested frameworks are for chumps. Sure, the extensive Stack Overflow answers are nice, but since when did the karma-controllers at HN give two shits about Python or Ruby? Not since PG was forbidden from watching PG-rated movies.
Using Perl? They will award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
That's why I shifted gears and rebuilt everything from the ground up using Golang.js. Heard of Golang.js? I bet you haven't. You're forgiven if you think it's some kind of Golang-to-JS interpreter, which is what I initially thought, until the two people on #golangjs called me a Cro-Magnon troglodyte for even attempting to ask that question. They didn't have to say all those nasty things about my mother, though.
Anyway, Golang.js is a Rust framework that compiles directly into an experimental version of Dart (duh). It's compatible on 5 of the 7 Chrome nightly builds that came out last week. And it's the motherfucking future, guys.
Worried about performance at scale or managing a CDN? Worry no more. It taps into Mechanical Turk to dynamically request human drones who spin up Nginx servers off Raspberry Pis, while its S3 replacement leverages SpiderOak illicitly and is ultra-secure…somehow. Look, I don't have to understand the framework to understand the impact it will have on web development. Did I mention it's completely open source? I can't exactly find the source, but it's open, somewhere. Maybe it's on some dude's SpiderOak account.
But I digress. Are you interested in turning your barely dynamic webpage into a barely dynamic webapp that runs on the equivalent of web-x86-assembly? I bet you are, fellow HN'er. You're on the bleeding edge, and you're willing to hemorrhage a metric shit-ton of technical debt to keep that edge bloody. Because that's how you stay competitive in this dog-eat-dog world of Randian objectivism that we all delude ourselves into believing we're in.
The steps are simple. First, make sure you have a FreeBSD image running on a virtual machine somewhere. It has to be FreeBSD, and it has to be a virtual machine. For some reason it won't work natively, but I submitted a bug report to their BitGit repo wiki (BitGit, by the way, is a forked version of git that borrows concepts from the bitcoin blockchain. The maintainers demand you use BitGit for its distributed wiki. Also, totally the future, so watch out.)
Got that rolling? Awesome. Get on the #golangjs IRC channel. There should be a guy there 30% of the time. He's going to call you a lot of names and insult your parentage. Ignore this. Graciously ask them for a precompiled toolchain for FreeBSD 9.1.
Oh shit, are you running FreeBSD 9.2-RC4? Yeah, you're gonna want to roll back.
Are you rolled back? Great. Things are kinda hazy from here, but if you search diligently on usenet you can find something called “Golang.js for Fucking Idiots.” I had a copy but it's actually part of this self-contained OS image that self-destructs itself—and any copies on the local network—after 10 hours of opening. Really cool tech, you should check it out; definitely the future of reading.
Anyway, now comes the tricky part. You're going to have to read that self-destructing book in 10 hours and hope to the Flying Spaghetti Christ-Monster you retain some of it. This particular framework relies heavily on an esoteric concept called “funhouse reflection,” whereby it will forcibly mutate supposedly immutable objects in your code and change variable scope at will, sometimes randomly. Also, best get your Towers of Hanoi out, because you're going to need your recursion toolbox. Due to some pretty clever implementations with the Dart interpreter, functional recursion is considered the preferred looping method.
Eventually, you'll wind up with some Dart code. DO NOT RUN THIS CODE. There's a special Dart linter you MUST run—but it only works on Windows 8.1 machines natively. Doesn't work in virtual images for some reason—still haven't found the maintainer of the linter, so I haven't submitted a bug report, but apparently they have a Gopher page and run an off-label meshnet BBS so I'm sure I'll be able to submit a bug report eventually.
Okay, at this point, if you're running a Chrome nightly, you'll finally see your pages 71.4% of the time. Unless Spideroak is down and no one has Turked your Nginx server, in which case you probably need to send some emails. To whom, I don't know, but that's an integration detail. At scale this system would work fantastically well, and if you're not preparing for scale…I mean, why are you even building it? If it breaks at not-scale, that's okay.
And that's it! With Golang.js, my sparsely-dynamic five-page websites took, soup-to-nuts, only three weeks of development time. Spent on nights and weekends. Without sleeping on the nights. Or the weekends. And it's not connected to a database yet, but Firehose support is supposedly only a few point releases away.
So, what do you think HN? How long until I redo it in Django? Feedback welcome, especially if it shatters my fragile self-worth!
MELBOURNE: Australia on Tuesday announced 13 innovative projects with India that will support new cutting-edge collaborative research partnerships between universities, professional bodies and private sector organizations of the two countries.The latest initiatives will be supported through Australia-India Council (AIC) grants programme, said Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop "AIC's grants, totaling over 565,000 Australian dollars will support new partnerships between Australian and Indian universities, professional bodies, private sector organizations and arts communities in areas of strong mutual interest and where the bilateral relationship has the greatest capacity to grow," Bishop said."This year's programme will fund cutting-edge collaborative research in the mapping of salt affected land and water resources; the sharing of Australia's experience in implementing food standards, managing major sporting events and planning for sustainable urban transport links; and a new teacher education exchange program," they said.The grants were extended to Opera Australia for "Shane Warne The Musical" tour of India project, Sharing Stories Foundation for installation in India of "Song for Country", a multimedia exhibition celebrating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island culture.Other projects which would be supported by AIC are Australia India Institute 's Australia India Public Sector Reform Seminar, Griffith University's collaborative study on Food Safety and Standards in India with Indian Agricultural Research Institute to help improve food value chains in India.University of Sydney's national workshop of extending the value of data on novel analysis for soil and water resources which would be in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology - Kharagpur. In the area of art and culture, AIC will support AusHeritage in revitalizing Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar museum with Australian conservation expertise.
On their radio program last month, rabidly anti-LGBTQ pastor Kevin Swanson railed against the current remake of “Beauty and The Beast,” not only for featuring a gay character but also for supposedly promoting “inter-species breeding.”
Swanson said that the movie was an “insidious” effort to “homosexualize the next generation of eight and ten-year-old kids” and ensure that they are “indoctrinated into the homosexual lifestyle.”
“This is how revolutions take place,” they said. “You are in the middle of a cultural revolution in the United States of America. No, this is not the cultural revolution that Mao Tse-tung brought to China; this is a different kind of cultural revolution, but I'm going to say it's just about as dangerous … though a bit more insidious.”
Even worse, Swanson said, the film is promoting inter-species breeding, which they said Hollywood has been pushing since the days of Star Trek.
“Christians, I don't believe, can allow for this,” Swanson stated. “Humans are made in the image of God. Humans are assigned a spouse which happens to be a member of the opposite sex. Friends, God's law forbids it … Christians should not allow for this, man. We cannot allow for humans to interbreed with other species. It's just wrong, wrong, wrong. It's confusion, it's unnatural.”
“We are in some of the most radical, most anti-biblical, the most immoral, the most unethical, the most wicked sexual environment that the world has ever known, right now,” they warned.
President Barack Obama has hardly been shy about exerting executive power. And yet they haven't closed the loophole that lets hedge fund and private equity moguls pay lower tax rates — an act that, some tax experts say, they and their Treasury Department already have the power to do.
While Obama blames Congress for blocking them from closing the so-called carried interest loophole, their private foundation has been busy raising money from the hedge fund and private equity industries that benefit from the tax break.
An International Business Times review of federal records shows that the hedge fund of at least one Obama Foundation donor has recently lobbied the Treasury Department on tax issues. Meanwhile, many of the Obama Foundation donors or board members with connections to the finance industry have visited the president at the White House numerous times during their administration.
For instance, James Simons of the hedge fund firm Renaissance Technologies gave the Obama Foundation between $500,000 and $1 million. Renaissance spent $300,000 lobbying the federal government in 2015, according to U.S. Senate records. The company's outside lobbying firm specifically pressed the Treasury Department on “taxation of management fees, derivatives taxation, any other tax issues that may have an impact on clients,” the Senate records show. Meanwhile, visitor logs show that Simons visited the White House at least six times since Obama took office. Their most recent visit was a dinner with the president and about 20 tech and science notables at the White House last year.
While their firm lobbied the Obama administration on taxes, Simons made $1.7 billion last year, according to Institutional Investor's list of the top paid hedge fund managers in 2015.
Ariel Investments' John W. Rogers , D.E. Shaw's David Shaw, and Grosvenor Capital Management's Michael Sacks are also major donors to the Obama Foundation from the finance industry that benefits from the tax loophole. Additionally, Kleiner Perkins' John Doerr is on the board of the foundation. Visitor log records show that those executives have repeatedly visited the White House — including for meetings with President Obama himself. Ariel has also lobbied Obama's Treasury Department in the past eight years. Shaw's $750 million in earnings in 2015 earned them a spot on Instiutional Investor's list.
Wall Street was generous to Obama long before they began raising money for their foundation, which is overseeing the construction of Obama's presidential library. During their campaigns for U.S. senator and president, Obama accepted more than $25 million from the securities and investment industry, according to the nonpartisan watchdog Center for Responsive Politics. That includes more than $2.6 million from donors in what the group classifies as “private equity and investment,” and more than $2 million from the hedge fund industry.
Annual Paws n' Claws Bazaar helps place the animals
Thursday, Nov. 18, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Eccles Institute of Human Genetics, First Floor Atrium
The Paws n' Claws Holiday Bazaar is an annual benefit to raise funds for the care, support, and placement of the U's retired research animals. Every effort is made to adopt them into responsible, permanent homes in the community. The fund-raising activity is critical for the success of the adoption program, providing a resource for a currently-unfunded program. The monies raised also support the adoption program's work with animal rescue groups inside and outside Utah.
Everyone working to find homes for the U's research animals volunteer their time. The Paws n' Claws Bazaar involves a variety of talented individuals who make their art and creations and then come together in good spirit to sell their wares. All donate a percentage of their sales to the Development Fund for Retired Research Animals at the U of U, a tax-deductible donation. Complete details on the event are available here.

SALT LAKE COUNTY, Utah -- One man is in custody after a SWAT situation in West Valley City early Sunday morning.
A shot fired incident in Salt Lake City Saturday night led authorities to the standoff that occurred at about 3 a.m.
At about 10:30 p.m. on Saturday, nine shots were fired toward police officers in the neighborhood of 1071 W. Wenco Circle. Police say there had been reports of a suspect who had a gun in the area and was trying to find and hurt someone.
As officers were talking to witnesses, the suspect, identified as a man in their 40s, allegedly fired at police. Nobody was injured.
At 3 a.m., the same man, who authorities say, shot at police in Salt Lake City, was involved in a SWAT situation near the 3800 South block of 3200 West.
Police say two women were also inside an apartment with the suspect.
The SWAT team used an explosive breach to enter the residence and get all the people out.
Officers on scene confirm that the man was armed at the time and was on parole prior to this arrest.
"Based on the circumstances and the history that this individual has we wanted to be cautious, not just for our officers but for their safety as well,” said Lt. Tyrone Farillas with Salt Lake City police.
The women were also taken into custody at the time. Police say it is unknown what or if they had any involvement in the prior incident in Salt lake City.
The suspect's name has not been released.

(CNN) If they're being honest, most mothers will tell you that no matter how badly you want a child, the transition to parenthood is hard. Really hard.
According to a recent study, the drop in happiness experienced by parents after the birth of first child was larger than the experience of unemployment, divorce or the death of a partner.
The ickiness you feel in pregnancy as your body becomes alien to you. The childbirth, and the healing after. The breastfeeding struggles -- oh, the struggles and the tears. The isolation of being home alone all day with a crying infant while your partner is at work.
At least, that's what it was like for me, when my first child was born in 2011.
A new study suggests when people experience early parenthood -- pregnancy, childbirth and the baby days -- as particularly stressful, they are less likely to want to do it again.
The study by the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, found "the larger the loss in well-being, the smaller the probability of a second baby." The effect is especially strong for highly-educated parents and those who waited longer to have a second child.
That might sound obvious, but it has policy implications for countries with low birth rates, the authors suggest.
The findings were recently published in the Journal Demography by Mikko Myrskyla, demographer and director at the Planck Institute, and Rachel Margolis from the sociology department at the University of Western Ontario. They looked at well-being data from 2,000 first-time parents starting two years before the birth of their first child until the year after the birth. They found 58% of the participants went on to have a second child over an average of nine years after the first one.
"The investigation deals with a taboo subject. It is rarely discussed that parents often experience a considerable loss of happiness after the birth of a first child," the Institute said in a press release. "The new study shows that for mothers and fathers in Germany, the drop in life satisfaction during the year following the first birth is even larger than that caused by unemployment, divorce or the death of a partner."
That last line is making parents wince. Cheree Pollard Biggs wrote on the CNN Parents Facebook page , "I have suffered through a death of my partner and a divorce and I can tell you that both death and divorce are far more 'unhappy' than the joy I felt after the birth of each child. Yes, I was tired and overwhelmed, but I was happy. Birth is an addition, a renewed sense of hope, a reason to continue. Death and divorce are losses."
But plenty of parents we surveyed agreed that the lows of parenthood can be pretty low -- and it really does take a village to combat them.
Alexa Hart, a mother of a 15-month-old in the Bay Area, told me part of the trauma of new parenthood "rests in our cultural silence" about how challenging it is, financially, emotionally, and on a marriage.
"We accept that divorce and death are traumatic, and condolences are offered when those life events occur. But when you're pregnant/expecting, everyone is 'so happy' for you. We expect some challenges, but we don't discuss the deep frustration, total sleep deprivation and heartbreaking questioning of self that comes with new life," they said.
The authors said they were not looking at what makes parents happy or unhappy -- they were specifically looking at why, although most German couples say they would like to have two children, they end up stopping after one.
"On the whole," Myrskyla said, "despite the unhappiness after the first birth of a baby, having up to two children rather increases overall happiness in life."
In my case, it took a good two years before I could even consider going through pregnancy, childbirth and the baby days again. The second time around, I sought out help from lots of different people, and was determined to change the most unpleasant parts of the experience in whatever ways I could.
Robert Hughes Jr., professor of family studies at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, ‏said if countries want more highly educated parents to have a second child, they must "really think about how you support these families." The U.S. has the same pattern of older and well-educated parents not replacing themselves, they said.
"I think people are making really rational choices," they said. "We're going to have to reduce the burden of balancing work and family life, and most of that is probably going to be on the side of altering work schedules and providing new parents in particular with extra supports during that transitional period."
I love cutting edge science, but sometimes it can seem nefarious enough to make a James Bond villain squeal in delight. Researchers at Harvard University have designed a laser system that can control your mind…or at least the mind of a roundworm. These scientists were able to affect the nervous system of a genetically altered C. elegans roundworm by shining lasers on its neurons – allowing them to make it travel in the direction they wanted, paralyze it in place, or even induce it into laying eggs! While previous experiments could affect C. elegans in a similar way, the Harvard team controlled their roundworms while still letting them move freely. In other words, even if the worms tried to run away the mind control laser could still track them down and make them do its bidding. There are some amazing, albeit brief, videos of this system in action – check them out below. For all you evil geniuses out there it's a little early to start practicing your maniacal laughter, but experiments like this could shed some valuable light on how our nervous systems really work.
Nature didn't build many animals such that you can control their nervous systems with lasers. That requires some handy genetic splicing. C. elegans were given genes that caused the nerves in their bodies to be responsive to light – sort of like the neurons in your eyes. By shining blue or green light on the worm, different genes in the neurons could be targeted. This powerful technique of genetically modifying cells to be responsive to light is called optogenetics and we've already seen it used in mammals. We can expect big things from optogenetics in the future. In the following video, a roundworm has the gene for Channelrhodopsin in its touch nerves. When those cells are exposed to blue laser light, it feels as if it has been touched and swims in the opposite direction. Awesome.
The roundworm in the following video has Halorhodopsin in its motor neurons. When a green laser hits those neurons they are inhibited, resulting in paralysis. Pretty creepy if you imagine the human analog.
In the following video, the C. elegans has two nerves in the middle of its body that have the Channelrhodopsin gene. The laser slowly scans up the body of the worm, and when it reaches these two nerves they become stimulated (around 0:45 or frame 8828). Stimulated to do what? Lay eggs. …I'll let you imagine your own nightmares for this one.
Making a roundworm recoil from an imaginary touch, freeze up, or poop eggs is fun, but the real innovation here is the setup that makes those actions possible. The C. elegans laser system is known as Controlling Locomotive Behavior in Real Time or CoLBeRT (yes, named after Stephen Colbert). It was created by Aravi Sammuel's lab at Harvard University, and represents a great step forward in animal testing for neuroscience. CoLBeRT tracks the position of a moving roundworm at 50 frames per second, then using a digital micromirror device, the system can shine laser light on a target with a precision of about 30 microns. C. elegans, which is about 1mm long, is digitally divided into 100 segments that CoLBeRT can aim for. Because CoLBeRT is so fast, scientists can let the worm roam freely, tracking it through its specimen dish, and readjusting its position using a mechanized platform. Here is perhaps the first system that lets you stimulate an animal in this way without really impairing its movement at all. That's huge. The development of CoLBeRT, and its testing on C. elegan was recently documented in the journal Nature Methods.
Early prototypes of CoLBeRT were developed by Andrew Leifer in the Sammuel Lab. In the following video Leifer gives a quick tour of a CoLBeRT predecessor (the real version probably doesn't use a recycling bin). They explain how the system can track and then illuminate the tiny roundworm.
I've been rather glib about calling this system ‘mind control' and making mad scientist references. Hey, the computer code for CoLBeRT is actually called “Mind Control” so you can hardly blame me. (Seriously, it's available for free, check it out. Uses OpenCV, too.) The truth is, however, that CoLBeRT isn't important because it alludes to the possibilities of mind control in humans, it's important because it could shine some really valuable light on how our nervous systems control our bodies.
C. elegans only has 302 neurons, and CoLBeRT can target very small groups of nerves (as you saw in the egg video). The precision allows the Sammuel Lab to test what each group of nerves does and how they interact. With such great control over a simple system they could learn a lot about the ways neurons pass signals, and how signals are coordinated for big actions like swimming.
For now, the Sammuel Lab is working with little roundworms, but optogenetics like this can be applied to much larger animals such as mice. Eventually I think techniques like CoLBeRT could provide insights into how human minds work. Not just movements, but emotions, and complex thoughts as well. We're looking at a very early step on the path to mapping the mechanics of our nervous system. That's exciting. Maybe not “mind-controlling your neighbors with a laser pointer” exciting, but still pretty cool.
If you've enjoyed the clips of manipulated C. elegans, you can find more videos of CoLBeRT controlling worms here.

WASHINGTON — Afghanistan remains a violent place, but major cities have recently made security gains and the United States is on track to hand over security responsibilities to Afghan forces and wrap up the war in two years, according to the Pentagon's latest biannual report to Congress on progress in Afghanistan.
The number of attacks in the first nine months of 2012 was higher than before the U.S. troop surge that began in 2009, but fell by 3 percent from the same period in 2011. Violence is much lower now than at the height of the surge in 2010, the report said.
Attacks rose 1 percent during the past six months, as NATO and Afghan troops contended with Taliban forces trying to regain territory lost in the surge, officials said Monday.
“We are not seeing the Taliban coming back, but we do see the Taliban intent on coming back,” a senior defense official told reporters at the Pentagon, speaking on the condition of anonymity. As a result, the official said, Taliban commanders are telling foot soldiers to stay in Afghanistan for a winter of fighting.
Terrorist safe havens in Pakistan –- identified in the last report in May as the No. 1 threat to Afghan security -– remain a danger, the report said, but “limited institutional capacity of the Afghan government, and endemic corruption” are now as much a risk as safe havens, the report said.
Afghan National Security Forces continue to gain in skill and numbers, and were “unilaterally” conducting about 80 percent of total operations this fall, while NATO and U.S. troops increasingly are taking on support roles and conduct about 10 percent of total operations without Afghan help, the report said
By the end of September, 30 Afghan army brigades and 49 police units were rated “independent with advisors.” That means they still lack advanced capabilities like air support and intelligence, but “the actual fighting, the actual operations on the ground, the actual patrolling” are done by Afghans, the senior official said.
As a result, ANSF this year began to take the brunt of the casualties, the report said. At the same time, U.S. combat deaths have fallen to their lowest level since the surge began, with casualties falling by more than 30 percent from 2011.
USA Today on Monday reported that U.S. combat deaths in 2012 numbered 301, a drop of some 25 percent over the same period in 2011 and the lowest rate since 2009, when the surge was revving up.
A total of 37 “green on blue” attacks on NATO and U.S. forces by Afghan forces have resulted in 51 coalition deaths in 2012, but the pace of attacks has fallen sharply since August, when ISAF Commander Gen. John Allen put new measures in place to prevent them.
Insurgent violence in major cities fell sharply this year compared to 2011, the report said. Attacks in Kabul dropped 22 percent, 62 percent in Kandahar and 88 percent in Mazar-i-Sharif. Kunduz bucked the trend, with attacks rising 2 percent.
More fighting took place in remote areas, particularly in the so-called “Taliban Heartland” in southern Afghanistan, where 12 percent of all attacks took place in districts with only one percent of the national population, the report said.
“The fact that it's in less populated areas means it's less effective violence,” the official said.
Ahmad Majidyar, a senior research associate with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agrees that the surge was successful in the southern part of Afghanistan –- primarily Kandahar and Helmand provinces –- but said eastern Afghanistan remains a haven for the Haqqani terrorist network.
The surge troops stopped the momentum of the Taliban in the south, helped the Afghan government expand and allowed the improvement of Afghan security forces in that area, Majidyar said.
While the report notes that the Taliban will likely try to regain lost territory, Majidyar says they think their strategy now is more focused on intimidating the Afghan people while they wait until coalition forces have left to attempt to topple the Afghan government .
Though the surge pushed the Taliban out of some areas, no one knows how durable the gains will be, said Vanda Felbab-Brown, foreign policy fellow at the Brooking Institution and author of a new book about the future of Afghanistan.
Whether the transition in Afghanistan is really on track, as the report claims, is questionable, they said.
“To the extent that we define transition as getting out of Afghanistan, which I see as increasingly the mood… then we are certainly on track,” Felbab-Brown said. “If one defines on track as leaving behind a stable government with a capable security component, then no, we are not on track.”

Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump's first campaign manager, announced Wednesday that they and another Trump campaign veteran are launching a government relations and political consulting firm. In a conversation with Yahoo News, Lewandowski said the company, Avenue Strategies, will back candidates “who support the Trump agenda” and help corporate clients “navigate” the new government.
Lewandowski insisted their new venture isn't a break with Trump's campaign pledge to “drain the swamp” and change the traditional Washington scenario in which former politicos cash in on their connections.
“I can promise you I will not be a registered lobbyist,” Lewandowski said. “Yeah, I can promise you I will not be a swamp creature.”
The launch of Avenue Strategies was first reported by the Washington Examiner's David Drucker, who said Barry Bennett, Lewandowski's partner in the firm, would be registering as a lobbyist.
The two partners sent out a press release Wednesday touting the fact their firm will be “just a block from the White House,” in the same building as the D.C. headquarters of Trump's presidential transition team.
Lewandowski worked with Trump from the earliest days of their long-shot presidential bid last year. They were fired in June after months of controversy that included battery charges after they allegedly grabbed the arm of a female reporter at a Trump campaign event in Florida. The state attorney's office declined to prosecute Lewandowski for the incident.
Despite their exit from the campaign, Lewandowski, who went on to work as an election commentator for CNN, has remained close with Trump. They regularly provided advice during the final months of the presidential race and has met with the president-elect during the transition. In the press release announcing Avenue Strategies' launch, Lewandowski said they “will always be President-elect Trump's biggest supporter.” Lewandowski told Yahoo News that they decided to launch the company after turning down “multiple opportunities” to take a job in Trump's White House.
“If you ask anybody who has happened to know me for the last 20 years, they will tell you that I am not the type of person to traditionally go inside an agency or an administration. That's not where I can produce the best value,” said Lewandowski. They added, “I think my value proposition is best where I can help coordinate outside entities to support an administration or to support objectives of that administration, whether that's grassroots activities or grasstops activities, something of that nature.”
Lewandowski would not say whether they discussed plans for the company with Trump.
“I don't want to talk about any private conversations which I may or may not have had with the president-elect,” Lewandowski said.
Prior to leading the Trump campaign, Lewandowski worked for multiple campaigns, as a lobbyist and as a marine patrol officer in their home state of New Hampshire. They also held positions with the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, a major force behind the tea party movement. Bennett managed Ben Carson's presidential campaign before becoming a senior adviser to Trump when Carson left the race. Trump nominated Carson for the position of secretary of housing and urban development earlier this month.
Lewandowski and Bennett first met roughly 20 years ago when they were both working as chiefs of staff for Ohio members of congress. Lewandowski called Bennett a “very, very capable operative” and praised their work on Carson's campaign.
“They raised an enormous amount of money. They were very successful, and they built a long-term opportunity for Dr. Carson,” Lewandowski said.
On the political front, Lewandowski said their goal would be helping other candidates tap into the movement started by Trump.
“That movement was not harnessed in a way until the very end because many of the people fell outside the traditional political structure. So, in other words, they didn't identify themselves as Republicans or Democrats,” Lewandowski said. “They identified themselves as Americans, and Donald Trump tapped into the desire to make America great again and put America first. And I want to make sure that that movement continues.”
Trump's campaign was distinctive because the candidate was able to generate significant media coverage through social media posts and comments made in rallies and interviews rather than paying for television advertisements. Lewandowski said they would aim to help candidates connect with voters through social media, but they cautioned that Trump's approach can't necessarily be replicated by another politician.
The man was wearing a military-style "Ghillie suit" consisting of strips of camouflage fabric and was standing in the right-hand lane of a highway south of Kalispell on Sunday night when they were hit by the first car, according to the Montana Highway Patrol. A second car hit the man as they lay in the roadway, authorities said.
Flathead County officials identified the man as Randy Lee Tenley, 44, of Kalispell. Trooper Jim Schneider said their motives were ascertained during interviews with friends, and alcohol may have been a factor but investigators were awaiting tests.
"He was trying to make people think they were Sasquatch so people would call in a Sasquatch sighting," Schneider told the Daily Inter Lake newspaper on Monday. "You can't make it up. I haven't seen or heard of anything like this before. Obviously, their suit made it difficult for people to see him."
Ghillie suits are a type of full-body clothing made to resemble heavy foliage and used to camouflage military snipers.
"He probably would not have been very easy to see at all," Schneider told KECI-TV.

Donald Trump has said they want Hillary Clinton to run again for president.
In a morning tweet, the President said: “I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020? My answer was, ‘I hope so!'”
Ms Clinton has said they are “done with being a candidate”.
However, they have expressed that they would remain active in national politics, telling CBS in September that they believed “our country's future is at stake.”
Prior to their 2016 bid for the White House, Ms Clinton ran for the Democratic nomination for President in 2008, eventually losing to Barack Obama.
Following their loss to Mr Trump last year, Ms Clinton mostly disappeared from the public eye. But in recent months, while promoting their new book What Happened, the former senator and Secretary of State has been candid about their thoughts on Mr Trump and the events that transpired during the presidential campaign.
While speaking on Sunday at the Southbank Centre's London Literature Festival, Ms Clinton said they were worried that Mr Trump could in “a moment of pique” launch a nuclear missile. They also accused the President of “picking fights” with North Korea and Iran for the sake of “point scoring.”
Earlier this year, Mr Trump warned that threats from North Korea would be greeted with “fire and fury like the world has never seen”. The Trump administration is currently engaged in a standoff with North Korea over the regime's expanding nuclear weapons programme.
On Friday, Mr Trump struck a blow against the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement by choosing not to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal. In the Obama-era accord, Iran had agreed to restrict its nuclear programme for at least 10 years in exchange for the loosening of economic sanctions.
Along with calling the deal merely a “temporary delay” on Iran's “path to nuclear weapons”, Mr Trump said the removal of sanctions was giving the Iranian “regime” more funds to support terrorism.
In July, Mr Trump joked that Russian President Vladimir Putin would have preferred Hillary Clinton to be in the White House.
“[I]f Hillary had won, our military would be decimated,” Mr Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network. “Our energy would be much more expensive. That's what Putin doesn't like about me. And that's why I say, why would they want me?”
“We're going to be exporting energy – they don't want that. They would like Hillary where they want to have windmills,” the President added. “He would much rather have that because energy prices would go up and Russia, as you know, relies very much on energy.”
Mr Trump is expected to seek re-election in 2020.
Wheat was one of the worst performing commodities over the first half of 2014.
This is hugely surprising as much of North America is in extreme drought and Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat to Europe. Nevertheless, the International Grain Council says we could be looking at the largest supply in 15 years. Of course, if you want to learn just how useful commodity industry bodies are then just spend ninety seconds googling OPEC. My guess is that we are witnessing yet more market manipulation intended to keep inflation down so more money can be printed and given to banks. (Although there is only so much time that particular balloon can be held underwater.)
And so we come once more to what is confidently the silliest 'seasonal festival' of the pagan wheel of the year, Lammas. It is the Academy Award seat filler of the magical calendar.
We will not be talking about the ethics of celebrating an agricultural festival given our revised understanding of the impact farming had on human history because we covered that more than three years ago. Wikipaedophile tells us that English peasants were bound to bring their first harvest of wheat to their lords before the first of August. So it doesn't take too much imagination to realise what is actually being harvested. We were. We are.
There was always more than one harvest but now that we are at Peak Everything then there is actually only one.
Reap what you sow
Two separate people asked me about the impact of hidden technology on the emerging-and-unavoidable rebalancing of global resources via a state of continuous war. It's actually so important that I almost put it in the last post.
Check this out:
That is a completely silent object witnessed over Kansas earlier this year performing complete 180s. It's also quite clearly the great-grandaughter of the B-2, not little green men. So it' one of ours.
Where is that phasing coming back from/going to? You think it's getting there with coal power?
Returning to the question to do with suppressed technology and specifically over-unity energy, I am 99.5% sure it exists now and 50% sure it has been around for at least forty years. Below are some photos from the recent Secret Space Programme Conference Flickr account. I didn't watch it or attend for a variety of reasons but they paint a tantalising picture of what a lot of all that spook money has been doing since the middle of the twentieth century.
The shadow state is certainly reaping the whirlwinds it has sown with our tax seeds. Lammas must be a very different affair in the Raytheon boardroom.
So wouldn't the release of over-unity energy free us from the zero sum resources game and thus leave Eurasia to heal itself after being fucked with the strap-on from Se7en for the last fifty years? Yes it would. The common, ill-considered answer is that 'they' don't want to do this because 'they' are making so much money from the hydrocarbon industry.
Yeah, maybe. But 'they' always make money. Resistance is coming from a few places. Firstly, governments, whose hydrocarbon taxation revenue is the backbone of state spending (it is also extremely predictable and largely impossible to evade). Secondly, from the financial sector as the US dollar, no longer backed by gold, is backed by a pseudo-standard of oil. Thirdly, from a military perspective, you end up with the 'dreadnought paradox': once you release game-changing military technology, you reset the arms race to zero and lose all accrued advantage. (This is why it is still illegal to use mustard gas under UN Convention, but no mention is made of directed energy weapons which are now available on arms dealers' websites.) The West has certainly gone completely rogue these last three decades but ask yourself seriously whether you want to reset the superweapon clock in today's world of everyone having multiple enemies... particularly when so many of them are divided along religious lines that make them all less amenable to negotiation.
The final reason is grim and seems to be missed in all conversations I am involved in because it is just so hard for non-psychopaths to think like a Rockefeller.
This is world population growth since the industrial revolution and widespread availability of hydrocarbon energy.
Lest you think the impact of this comes from anything but an agricultural and economic system based in hydrocarbons, let's look at the population growth from the second half of the twentieth century, when the developing world started to get electricity, gasoline and running water.
You think the Saudis and the Bushes and the Rockefellers and the Windsors want to turn that dial up to infinity. Do you? What is the agricultural equivalent of free energy? What do you harvest to feed thirty billion people?
For the people who presume to run the world, there are all together too many of us. Why would they triple the number of serfs when they want to cap the total number of earth employees at half a billion?
And ebola makes four
So we have the actual plague breaking out in Colorado and in Chinese cities (that are subsequently completely quarantined). And now we also have the longest, deadliest run of ebola showing up in Africa's most populous city... one that has dozens of flights every day to every corner of the earth.
Well, that's pretty much right on schedule, isn't it?
As seems to be the case so often, one of my personal favourite posts on this blog rolled by everyone like a tumbleweed. That's fine. Thanks to my birthday I have Sirius as a patron star and the Dog Days as my Ramadan. It might be more my stuff.
The Dog Days were historically a time of sickness, of plague. the saints whose holy days fall into this corner of the sky are all mythic healers. Saint Guinefort and Saint Roch compound the symbolism with their dog iconography. From Saint Anne who is clearly the theoitokos, Saint Pantaleon who is a physician and an off-brand St Cyprian trained in healing by Hermes... the calendar is littered with remnants that late July to late August are associated with cosmic illness and plague.
What else would we expect to happen at this time in this most haunted of years?
Demeter in chains
Back to Lammas, then.
The most profound effect of discovering that Jesus had no physical existence is that an entire corpus of mystery tech has been lifted up to utility and profundity right before me. It's like there has been a European form of hoodoo gnosticism in front of us the whole time, just waiting for the liberating key of archaeological evidence to open the doors to True Myth.
Suddenly you have this whole (deliberate choice of words) constellation of myths that represent a continuous, unbroken current stretching back into Classical Europe and beyond. In all but a few cases, these do not constitute an intentional concealment for posterity... there was no putting of baby superman into the final spaceship and shooting them off into the future. (With the likely exception of the Hermetica.) Rather I think that viewing mythology in the light of archaeological analysis is the closest we are going to get to approximating how our ancestors saw and experienced myth... because clearly it was a more sophisticated relationship. Chasing after that may well represent the only 'true' reconstructionism.
Lammas, being about the life cycle of grain, is clearly associated with Demeter and thus the sacrifice/underworld journey. There is every chance this awareness lasted a lot longer than we may realise. From the wikipaedophile page, here is a quote from Shakespeare about Juliet: "Come Lammas Eve at night they be fourteen." So they were born before the harvest, could not reap what they had sown and was ultimately sacrificed (in pursuit of love, no less).
Lammas is also the Feast of Saint Peter in Chains.
Sure, it's not Demeter's best likeness, but consider it in its component parts.
These people never physically existed, these events never happened and thus they are Teaching Myths experienced in the eternal now.
Peter is trapped 'in prison' by King Herod.
An angel appears to Peter -who is effectively Hermes, by the way- and tells them to leave.
Their chains fall off him, the doors to 'the prison' miraculously open and they follow the angel out into the 'Holy City', Jerusalem.
The angel vanishes, Peter realises it isn't a vision and goes to the house of The Mother Mary.
Mary. The servant girl who answers the door is so overjoyed to see him, they accidentally shut the door before they have entered.
Eventually, they are let in and describes how the Lord has brought them out of prison.
This is patently a gnostic typology of Christ's resurrection, with prison standing in for the earthly realm, Jerusalem our 'cosmic' home, the house of the mother being the afterlife and the secret of their eternality being 'the Lord'. It is highly significant that much of the Book of Acts deals with Jesus's disciples following in their footsteps, ie transforming themselves under similar means.
But here, on 'loaf mass', you have the same themes of imprisonment by an evil ruler/in the underworld, the removal of shackles and a restoration of the complete form... you have the underworld journey as agricultural life cycle allegory.
Who did this? Did someone sit down and plan out a divine word jumble? Hardly. It pieces itself together in the way of some people spinning somewhere. London's Church of Saint Peter in Chains is not only a royal peculiar attached to a famous royal prison (amusing given 'King' Herod), it is also the resting place of Saint Thomas More, who not only wrote Utopia -about their own floating Jerusalem, effectively- but also became an initiate of the Cult of the Head by losing their in service to their God. (As well as Anne Boleyn, who has a bit of Persephone about her.)
Reaping what you sow is not just a clumsy farming metaphor for doing what you are told, it encodes all manner of entheogenic, archaic, esoteric interpretations.
I'm terribly struck by all of this. The alignment of the feast day with Lammas does not represent one of those 'oh, the Christians couldn't stop the pagans doing their thing so they just plopped a church on it' bulllshiteries. In fact, it's unlikely very many of them fall into such reductive categorisation anyway. This is not some local goddess of a natural spring getting a 'saint' put in front of them name. This is proper Mystery Tradition stuff. This is 'hidden in plain sight'.
This is harvesting more than one thing. Enjoy your sacred carbs, kids.
Watchman paints quite a bleak view of humanity's ability not to destroy itself through nuclear war, but it turns out the world's real-life scientists are even more pessimistic on our odds.
The threat of nuclear destruction looms large throughout the 1986-87 comic book series by writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons, with the idea of time running out being one of its key themes. Issue No. 1 establishes that this alternative history's Doomsday Clock, in which midnight represents disaster for humankind, is set at five minutes until midnight. In real life, the clock was set at six minutes to midnight when the stories were being published — and that seemed bad enough.
Thirty years later, the Watchmen Doomsday Clock seems quaint compared to what we have in real life.
On Thursday, the scientists who oversee it moved the real Doomsday Clock from three minutes until midnight to two minutes and 30 seconds from midnight. The Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists cited climate change and nuclear threats — as well as rhetoric on these issues from President Donald Trump.
"We're so concerned about the rhetoric, and the lack of respect for expertise, that we moved it 30 seconds,” the board's Rachel Bronson told The New York Times. “Rather than create panic, we're hoping that this drives action."
The clock was first introduced in 1947, and it fell to an all-time low of 11:43 p.m. in 1991, the year the Cold War ended. The last time we were back in the "good old days" of just five minutes until midnight was 2015, when the clock moved forward from five to three minutes before midnight.
Here's the panel from Watchmen No. 1 introducing the clock, as well as a scene from the ultimate cut of Zack Snyder's 2009 adaptation.
A Brazilian drug gang member nicknamed Poison, 18, overlooking a slum in Salvador, which had 57.51 homicides per 100,000 residents in 2013. REUTERS/Lunae Parracho Murder is more common in Latin America than in any other part of the world.
That's the most striking takeaway from a ranking of the most violent cities compiled earlier this year by Mexico's Citizens' Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice. The ranking doesn't count deaths in war zones or cities with unavailable data.
Thirty-four of the 50 worst cities were located in the region, including repeat murder capital of the world — San Pedro Sula, Honduras— which saw 187 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2013 and is getting steadily worse. A full one-third of global homicides occur in Latin America even though the region has just 8% of the world's population, according to United Nations data.
Drug trafficking, gang wars, political instability, corruption, and poverty combine to cause the region's elevated violence.
US cities also made the list, led by Detroit at No. 24 and New Orleans at No. 26.
Williamsport, Lycoming County -- Accompanied by their wife, 34-year-old Jonathan DePrenda of Williamsport arrived in Lycoming County Court Thursday afternoon. They pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter and other charges for a crime that cost them their job and another man their life.
It was January 2014 when then Officer DePrenda responded to a high speed pursuit in Williamsport. Investigators say they topped speeds of 100 miles per hour when they slammed into a car while passing vehicles on East Third Street. The other driver, 42-year-old James Robinson of Williamsport, died in the fiery wreck. Before their plea and sentence, DePrenda told the court "I loved being a police officer. I wanted to fight evil. I'll never forget that night. I see this car and I cannot help this man. Our worlds collided."
The victim's mother, who still grieves the loss of their son, didn't want to see DePrenda serve prison time and have their family suffer. They chose to forgive. "The way I raised my kids was to forgive those who do things against you. And it's something that James would have done so I had to forgive him," said Nancy Robinson-Westbrook.
DePrenda was fired from the force last October as a result of the crash. Lycoming County District Attorney Eric Linhardt said DePrenda needed to be held accountable telling the courtroom, "Law enforcement has a higher responsibility to protect the well-being of the community. He'll no longer be a police officer and will carry a criminal record." Instead of prison time, a judge sentenced DePrenda to five years probation and 100 hours of community service. John Hernandez, who mourns the loss of Robinson to this day, did not want to cast judgment on DePrenda. "I forgive them because of the love of God I have... showed me the errors. Let it go. God will judge him."

ISTANBUL
Former Istanbul governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu has been detained as part of the investigation into July 15 attempted coup, a police source told Anadolu Agency on Tuesday.
Following their detention, the police are searching Mutlu's house, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity due to restrictions on speaking with the media.
Mutlu served as governor of the Istanbul province between 2010 and 2014, after which they took a post with the Interior Ministry as a civilian authority. After the failed coup, they were one of 246 such authorities suspended.
As part of the probe into the coup attempt, a total of 13,165 suspects have been taken into custody, including 1,485 police officers, more than 8,838 soldiers, 2,101 judicial members, 52 district governors, and 689 civilians.
5,863 suspects out of 13,165 detainees – including 123 generals, 282 high-ranking police officers, and 1,559 judicial members – have been charged with having links to the coup attempt.
Turkey's government has repeatedly said the deadly plot, which martyred at least 246 people and injured more than 2,100 others, was organized by followers of U.S.-based preacher Fetullah Gulen.
Gulen is also accused of a long-running campaign to overthrow the state through the infiltration of Turkish institutions, particularly the military, police, and judiciary, forming what is commonly known as the parallel state.

Arizona Lawmakers Target Public Workers' Unions
Labor unions plan to rally in front of the Arizona State Capitol on Thursday afternoon to protest four bills quickly moving through the state Legislature that could make last year's Wisconsin labor laws look modest by comparison.
Three of the four bills restrict the way unions collect dues and the way workers get paid for union activities. The fourth bans collective bargaining between governments and government workers: state and local. Unlike Wisconsin, it affects all government employees, including police and firefighters.
"It seems as though those employees or at least the unions that represent them don't care what the burden is on the taxpayer as long as they get theirs," says state Sen. Rick Murphy, a Republican who is sponsoring the bills.
Murphy says collective bargaining lets public workers put themselves ahead of the public they are working for.
You're not in government, you know, to collect a fat paycheck. You're in government to serve.
Nick Dranias of the Phoenix-based Goldwater Institute, a libertarian/conservative think tank that helped Murphy write the bills, says public-sector workers in Arizona make about 6 percent more in salary and benefits than their private-sector counterparts.
"You're not in government, you know, to collect a fat paycheck," Dranias says. "You're in government to serve. And if you get paid reasonably, that's nice, but the moment you feel the need to organize collectively and create laws like collective-bargaining laws that give you special privileges to negotiate and extract compensation not seen in the private sector, you've gone too far."
Arizona is also different from Wisconsin in that it's a right-to-work state: No one can be forced to join a union. So unions in Arizona already have less clout. Still, 80 percent of police in the state choose to belong to a union.
Brian Livingston, who represents the Arizona Police Association, which is fighting the bills, says police and firefighters typically get paid less in salary, but they acknowledge that they negotiate better benefits and retirement plans. Livingston says police deserve it.
"By the time we retire, we know that most of us will not live beyond what the average private citizen does," they say. "And I'm speaking specifically about public safety, the rigors of our occupation, the hazards of our occupation take a lifelong toll on our longevity."
Democrats in the Arizona Legislature are outnumbered by Republicans 2-to-1 in the House and by more in the Senate.
Senate Minority Leader David Schapira says they are appalled by the bills.
"These bills are clearly the most anti-worker, anti-middle class, anti-union bills in the history of the country," they say.
These bills are clearly the most anti-worker, anti-middle class, anti-union bills in the history of the country.
Schapira says the bills are purely political. They're being considered, they say, because union leaders tend to support Democrats over Republicans.
"These are people that the Tea Party leadership at the State Capitol in Arizona disagree with, and so they're punishing them and that's the purpose of these pieces of legislation," they say.
Murphy, the bills' sponsor, acknowledges that public worker labor unions are a political problem for him. The elected officials labor leaders are negotiating with, they say, are afraid to give in to unions for fear of political reprisal.
"When the unions are the ones who are disproportionately influencing those elected officials, the elected officials are very rarely on the side of the taxpayers in those negotiations," they say.
The swiftness of this new attempt at cutting the power of public worker unions took labor leaders by surprise. The bills were introduced just last week, passed through committee and are ready for a full Senate vote.

MINNEAPOLIS — After some months of negotiations, Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign reached agreement with the Democratic National Committee on Thursday on a joint fundraising agreement that will allow Clinton to help raise funds for the national party for use in the general election.
The agreement is an important step in preparing for what Democrats expect will be a fiercely competitive and costly general election in 2016. It allows Clinton to raise money for the national party as well as state parties in all 50 states and begin building a nest egg for next year.
The absence of the agreement had become a concern among some Democrats that they were falling behind in their preparations.
"In the face of unlimited soft money donations from billionaires funding the Republicans, Democrats will need a strong effort to counter and we are glad for the opportunity to work with the DNC on this," Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said in a statement.
The money raised jointly by the Clinton campaign and the DNC will be available to whoever the nominee is.
DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement that, with the agreement, "We are building the organization we will need now to make sure that whoever our nominee is, they are in the best possible position to win next November."
In addition to the agreement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC, the campaign also has reached similar agreements with state Democratic parties in Mississippi, New Hampshire, Virginia and Wisconsin. The New York Times first reported on the four state agreements this week.
One Democratic strategist said that one thing that held up the agreement was disagreement between the campaign and the DNC over control of the general election account and how it would be spent.
A Clinton campaign official denied that was the case, saying the negotiations were drawn out over "fine print." The official said the goal was to reach agreement with the DNC at the time of the party's summer meeting, which is ongoing in Minneapolis, in the hope that it would spur more states to come aboard.
The DNC has come under criticism from the campaigns of former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for taking steps they believe favor Clinton, especially in scheduling sanctioned debates.
A DNC official said the national party hopes to sign similar joint fundraising agreements with other Democratic campaigns.
I've always been a sucker for a great video game ending and always hungered to see those animated sequences at the end of a game.
There were always those times when you get to the end of the game and all you get is a "CONGRATULATIONS!!"
WHAT A LET DOWN.....
But then there are those endings that stay with you forever.....
I'd have to say my most memorable video game ending that I witnessed was the ending to World Cup 90 on the Arcade.
I witnessed when I was about 10 years old whilst waiting in the Fish & Chip shop queue on a Friday evening with my dad.
I was always obsessed with that arcade machine and I wouldalways yearn to play it long enough to complete it.
This particular evening a man was playing the game whilst I waited with dad in the queue and then I realised they were playing in THE FINAL!!
I was so excited, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen as they played out the Final in front of my eyes.
They were wiping the floor of the CPU opposition and was 3-0 up.
It seemed as though he'd completed the game before as they didn't look too fussed about the whole thing, but I was fixated!
AND THEN....
The Final Whistle Blew and all hell broke loose on the screen as their victorious team danced all over the screen......I was really impressed at the time!
BUT.....There was more....
A GIANT World Cup dropped onto the pitch which the players proceeded to frantically run and dance around!!
I was gobsmacked!
I ate my fish n chips with a massive smile that night and have never forgotten that crazy ending since.
Although looking at it now, maybe it wasn't quite so dramatic as I remembered it.
Hey, that's the beauty of nostalgia!
So, over to you......
Trump's 2021 bestseller may be called The Art of the Shruggie.
Following the spectacular failure of the American Health Care Act, it's now abundantly clear that President Trump's first 100 days in office will almost certainly not include a significant legislative victory for them or the Republican Party, despite their rare control of Washington, or their repeated promises to get rid of Obamacare. Furthermore, a central, self-made myth about Trump — that they are a master deal-maker — seemed to evaporate when it came to negotiating legislation. Indeed, insider accounts suggest that Trump's deal-making style likely hurt the AHCA more than it helped, as did their seeming lack of commitment to the actual process of policy-making and governing.
Here are some of the key takeaways (and leaked bits of gossip) that have emerged in the various postmortems published since the AHCA's demise on Friday.
Trump's Lack of Effort
Despite the proclamations of Paul Ryan, Sean Spicer, and others to spin Trump's participation in the AHCA push as some impressive feat of presidential prowess, several reports indicate that Trump was mostly disengaged from the process, divided over its merits, and only involved themselves at the last minute, largely out of ego.
The perception among lawmakers and White House insiders was that Trump was never personally invested in the bill, repeatedly asking aides if they thought it was good or not, typically prompted by the consistently negative media coverage of the bill that Trump was watching, according to the Washington Post. Politico adds that the oft-distracted president would also interrupt conversations about the health-care push to bring up other issues.
The Times noted on Saturday that Trump only seems to have come to the full realization that the bill required their personal effort on Wednesday, a late admission that shocked others involved in the process. Before and after that point, the president did end up conducting a lot of face-to-face meetings and making a lot of phone calls in support of the bill. They did not, however, push the bill directly to their supporters at rallies or on television, which could have helped generate some bottom-up pressure for the legislation, particularly since it's Trump's base which has always intimidated their GOP opponents the most. As for the Democrats, Trump made no apparent effort to include them in the AHCA process — other than blaming them for its failure after the fact.
An unnamed top Republican who attended AHCA meetings with Trump summed up the suspicions of many to Politico:
[The White House's] heart was not in the healthcare battle. Think about the level of intensity on the executive orders for the travel ban, or on the wiretapping claims. They certainly checked the boxes on healthcare, to their credit. But it's self-evident there was not a certain level of intensity devoted to this.
In the end, Trump's efforts were too little, too late, and too lightweight to make a definitive difference, and by the time it was all over, Trump had not, as Spicer claimed on Friday, “left everything on the field.”
In addition, insiders told Politico that Trump seemed relieved that the short, dramatically fruitless health-care push was now over, with one White House official saying that, “No bullshit, I think he's actually pretty comfortable with the outcome. They want to move ahead and do taxes.”
Trump Only Cared About Winning, Not Policy, Procedure, or Governing
“Nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated,” Trump told a group of governors in February. A month later, when the president finally decided to embrace their role in the legislative process and try to whip up support for the AHCA bill, Trump deployed a messaging strategy that was light on substance, heavy on Trump. Rather than assuage the policy concerns of skeptical Republicans, Trump often bullied them instead, asking them how well they did in their districts and telling them how badly the bill's failure might hurt them, and him, politically.
“Forget about the little shit,” Trump reportedly said to a group of 30 representatives who had come to the White House. “Let's focus on the big picture here,” and by big picture Trump meant their reputation, their agenda, and their chances at reelection.
Motivated by the desire to win, perhaps exclusively, Trump was unable to address specific policy issues when talking with members of the House GOP or conservative groups, and was just trying to play — and enjoy — the role of closer. Trump “didn't know, didn't care, or both,” when it came to details, according to a congressional aide who spoke with CNN. A GOP congressmember added that the president “did very little to say why we should vote ‘yes,'” and “kept talking about their damn election.”
It's not clear how detail-oriented Trump's real-estate negotiations were as a business person, but their approach to legislative negotiation was decidedly style over substance. Reports the Post:
They cajoled and charmed uncertain members, offering flattery and attention to some and admonishment and the vague threat of political retribution to others. They invited members to the White House for bowling sessions, gave others rides on Air Force One (complete with ­lasagna) and grinned for pictures in the Oval Office, where they reminded lawmakers of their margins of victory in their districts.
But legislating, it turned out, was different from cutting deals to splash their name across skyscrapers.
Trump's tactics were, of course, ultimately ineffective, which isn't surprising when considering how poorly the AHCA, and Trump himself, have been faring in opinion polls. For the House Freedom Caucus — the original members of the antiestablishment GOP — messing up Republican Party plans has been a point of pride for years, and the once-dominant Trump proved no more effective at cajoling their support with concessions and threats than the establishment Republican leaders who preceded him. For vulnerable Republicans in swing districts, all the rightward concessions made the bill too risky to back, and just like that, Trump found themselves stuck in the muck of a long-running party feud that almost anyone with a partial understanding of GOP politics could have anticipated.
The Post adds that some of the conservatives who stuck with their opposition to the AHCA appreciated Trump's style, but as House Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows said during the process, “This is about policy, and we're not going to make it about anything else.” As it turned out, Meadows and their hardliner compatriots couldn't be taken for granted, and Meadows themselves was reportedly already looking for an opportunity to prove their independence from Trump.
Furthermore, if it's true that Trump is now relieved to be able to move on to tax reform, that provides yet more evidence that the new president has little understanding of what it actually takes to govern, since the failure of the AHCA is sure to linger, and the resumption of GOP infighting, even under the populist Trump, suggests more legislative friction in the future.
Language, Please
Politico reports that one of Trump's contributions to the AHCA was to tell Paul Ryan that they objected to Ryan's use of the word “buckets” to describe parts of the plan. “I don't like that word buckets. You throw trash in buckets. I don't like that word,” Trump apparently told Ryan, and the Speaker subsequently started using the Trump-suggested “phases” instead.
Ultimately Empty Threats
As the AHCA's survival chances dropped, Trump and White House adopted a bullying tactic that was a trademark of Art of the Deal: ultimatums. The White House told representatives that if they didn't support the AHCA during this week, Obamacare would remain in place. Frustrated with the shifting demands of the House Freedom Caucus, Trump apparently told Representative Meadows on Thursday that the White House's proposal, as it stood at that point, was the “final offer,” and then cut off further discussion, according to The Wall Street Journal. It didn't work.
Another threat was made, supported by Bannon, Pence, and budget director Mick Mulvaney, to push ahead with a vote under the theory that Republicans, if forced into a binary choice, would opt to support Trump and the AHCA rather than risk being seen as aligned with Democrats for Obamacare. “It wasn't so much about shaming members who would vote ‘No' so much as daring them to do so,” a senior administration official told CNN. That didn't work either, as Trump eventually backed down after being convinced the vote could do more harm than good during the 2018 midterm elections, as well as how they might still need the support of GOP lawmakers for other legislative pushes in the future.
Both threats essentially amounted to Trump and the White House saying: “Stand with us or else,” but the administration got its bluff called instead.
Said Trump, after pulling the AHCA: “We all learned a lot. We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process. We learned a lot about some very arcane rules in obviously both the Senate and in the House.”
Bannon's Failed Paternalism
Chief White House strategist Steve Bannon reportedly fought relatively hard for the AHCA, though perhaps not wholeheartedly, but some of their tactics didn't carry much weight with hard-line members of the Freedom Caucus, despite the former Breitbart executive's right-wing credibility. Axios's Mike Allen reports that Bannon ordered the Caucus dissenters to support the bill during a meeting, insisting that, “This is not a discussion. This is not a debate. You have no choice but to vote for this bill.”
According to Allen, one congressperson apparently replied, “You know, the last time someone ordered me to something, I was 18 years old. And it was my daddy. And I didn't listen to him, either.”
Bannon also unsuccessfully pushed for a public, win-or-lose vote on the bill because they wanted to compile an enemies list so that the White House could identify and punish Republicans who voted against the president. Bannon undoubtedly has a perpetually revised enemies list, but their scorched-earth vote idea was vetoed by Trump.
Kushner's Ski Trip
⛷ A post shared by Lara Trump (@laraleatrump) on Mar 21, 2017 at 9:37am PDT
Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and supposed top advisor, spent most of last week on a family ski trip in Aspen, Colorado, with their wife Ivanka and their three kids, as well as Trump's sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, and their families. Kushner apparently never liked the AHCA, nor did their alleged White House ally, economic policy adviser Gary Cohn, but they probably should have skipped the slopes in the middle of the Trump administration's signature accomplishment attempt.
Trump was reportedly annoyed that Kushner was not at the White House during the final push for the AHCA, though the White House has since denied those reports.
Knives Out for Ryan?
According to the Breitbart set, the website is already reporting that sources in the White House and GOP want Paul Ryan gone, and they have a pile of angry anonymous quotes to back it up. Said one “close to the president” insider on Friday:
Speaker Ryan proved today that they do not have the best interests of the President at heart. They sold out the president and showed their word can be taken with a grain of salt. There is only one course of action that should be taken to move past this catastrophe and that is the swift removal of Paul Ryan from the speakership.
Vice-President Pence, worried about the bill's flaws, reportedly urged the president to refer to the plan as “Ryancare” instead of “Trumpcare,” and that's what Breitbart has been calling the plan. (Trump didn't heed that advice and went all in on the final AHCA push.) White House officials also seem to regret that they trusted Ryan to manage so much of the AHCA's development, roll out, and marketing — and the failure of the bill may prompt the Trump administration to build more of its own legislation from now on.
“This is 100 percent a Ryan failure,” a White House official told Politico on Friday before the AHCA was even gone, but even if that was a consensus view within the Trump administration, it's unlikely that they can successfully push future legislative efforts in the middle of a White House–supported leadership fight.
Trump apparently spoke with Ryan for an hour on Saturday, but didn't send the most supportive signal when they “coincidentally” promoted a broadcast of Judge Jeanine Pirro's show on Fox News during which Pirro called for Ryan to resign in a brutal opening monologue.
Knives Out for Priebus?
The Times reported Saturday that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, a close ally and friend of Ryan, had become a primary target of Trump's discontent, according to sources familiar with Trump's latest discussions. A CNN source claims that Trump seemed more upset with their own staff for allowing them to support the AHCA than they were with external players. Priebus, the former head of the RNC, apparently helped convince Trump to back the bill.
Priebus has survived previous anonymous disparagement from within the Trump administration, but Trump may decide they need to make an example of someone following the embarrassing AHCA failure, and they can't exactly fire the speaker of the House.
Preibus, responding to the Times story during a Fox News appearance on Sunday, denied that they were in trouble.
Blame Early, Blame Democrats
Trump quickly realized what was at stake from the failed AHCA gambit, and was already on the phone to reporters trying to control the bad story before everyone had even realized the bill was dead.
They also quickly decided whose fault it was that they and the Republican-controlled Congress were suddenly unable to govern: Democrats. Despite the fact that it was the president and Republicans who opted against trying to negotiate a compromise bill with Democratic lawmakers, as of Friday they were the monsters in the closet, even without President Obama at the helm or much measurable power in D.C. The Times reports that Trump was advised that this argument was nonsensical, but they went ahead with it anyway.
This post has been updated to reflect additional insight and news reported over the weekend.
BATESVILLE, Ind. – Giant paper cut-out cherries line the streets of Batesville, Indiana each February signifying the arrival of one thing:
The Thing-A-Ling.
Part doughnut and part fritter, this fried morsel stuffed with cherries and soaked in a pink glaze is only sold a few days a year. The limited sale has sent thousands of people – and dollars – into the small city about an hour west of Cincinnati for decades.
And it's all thanks to an idea Clem Schmidt had 42 years ago.
Cherries line the streets of Batesville
“I've never met another baker that's made one,” they said. "...They're very, very good."
Schmidt, 77, has owned Schmidt Bakery since 1963 but started making their now famous cherry pastry in 1976. They said they saw the words “Thing-A-Ling” on a bag of flour all those decades ago that inspired them to make their own cherry fritter.
The name stuck – and so did the city's love for their sweet concoction.
“The first time, maybe we sold 45 dozen. Then 50 dozen. Then 150 dozen,” Schmidt said. “Last year we sold over 4,000 dozen. That's 52,000 doughnuts.”
Schmidt said that number grows by about 7,000 doughnuts each year, and they expect this year to be no exception.
Schmidt Bakery sells the Thing-A-Ling every Presidents Day weekend. This year that's Thursday, Feb. 15 to Tuesday, Feb. 20. Schmidt said they chose Presidents Day because “George Washington chopped down the cherry tree, of course.”
And before you ask him, yes, they think President Donald Trump would enjoy a Thing-A-Ling.
“I don't meet many people that don't like the taste,” they said. “Even if you don't like cherries, you'll love the Thing-A-Ling.”
Making the Thing-A-Ling is a family affair for Schmidt. Their wife and daughters all have a part to play in the process of cooking up thousands of doughnuts.
In that single Thing-A-ling weekend, there will be more than 25 people working behind the scenes at Schmidt Bakery. Each person has an important role to play – from folding paper boxes to operating the fryer.
The Schmidt family will need all the help it can get to feed all those hungry customers.
“Even if it's cold outside, there's still a line,” Schmidt's daughter, Cindy Todd, said. “It's just wall-to-wall people. It's non-stop. We open at 4 a.m. and last year I was still frying at 6 p.m. It was crazy.”
Todd, 46, handles the bakery's finances. But that doesn't mean they won't be getting their hands dirty in the kitchen. In that single weekend, the bakery will go through 3 tons of cherries and twice that in flour, they said.
It's a lot of work.
“We only do it once a year because it makes a mess,” Todd said. “But everyone loves them so much, so we have to make them.”
Schmidt said the business will make more money Presidents Day weekend than it does in three months.
Todd said Schmidt already had hundreds of preorders last week. And those aren't just from locals – the bakery will be shipping Thing-A-Lings to Arizona and even Alaska.
The Thing-A-Ling has gotten so popular, Schmidt said Busken Bakery wants in on the action.
A photo of Schmidt when they first opened their bakery
“They want to make them and give me a royalty, but my daughter said, ‘Nope,'” Schmidt said. “If we want (the business) to go on, we need to keep it this way.”
Schmidt said they plan on selling the Thing-A-Lings every year for as long as they can. While they haven't touched the recipe in decades, it does come in chocolate, too.
You just have to ask.
“It makes every part of your taste buds pop,” Todd said. “There's nothing better than having one super warm, straight off the fryer. Now, that's some good Schmidt.”
August 20, 2014
The people demonstrating against racism and police violence in Ferguson, Mo., have kept up that fight despite every effort to intimidate or pressure them off the streets.
FERGUSON, MO., continues to be a war zone each night, a week and a half after 18-year-old Mike Brown was shot and killed by police for the "crime" of walking in the street.
From political leaders and media outlets, there are continuous calls for "peace," for "calm," for "reconciliation," for "restraint." But why are they demanding "peace" and "restraint" from only one side--and the wrong side at that?
It's true that every day and every night since Brown was killed, people have gathered in Ferguson--residents of the small city itself; others from the surrounding St. Louis area; still others who, yes, have traveled to Missouri to proudly express their solidarity--to demand justice and an end to police murder and repression.
They are right to do so. The demonstrators should be praised for their determination that this killing will not go unprotested--that there will be no peace without justice.
These are the people who are asked to be "calm"--but they aren't the ones causing the chaos in Ferguson. The responsibility for that lies with the police and the National Guard, supposedly deployed to preserve order, but whose presence perpetuates disorder. It lies with the political leaders ordering these cops and soldiers into action every night, even when it's obvious to anyone with an ounce of sense that an overwhelming show of militarized force escalates the conflict.
So obvious that CNN correspondent Jake Tapper--as mainstream a reporter as any in the U.S. media establishment--unexpectedly told it like it is on Monday night in a live report from Ferguson that likened police conduct there to U.S. troops waging war in Afghanistan:
I want to show you this, okay? To give you an idea of what's going on. The protesters have moved all the way down there...Nobody is threatening anything. Nobody is doing anything. None of the stores here that I can see are being looted. There is no violence. Now I want you to look at what is going on in Ferguson, Missouri--in downtown America, okay? These are armed police, with...semi-automatic rifles, with batons, with shields, many of them dressed for combat. Now why [are they] doing this? I don't know. Because there is no threat going on here. None that merits this. There is none, okay? Absolutely, there have been looters. Absolutely over the last nine days, there's been violence. But there is nothing going on on this street right now that merits this scene out of Bagram. Nothing. So if people wonder why the people of Ferguson, Missouri are so upset, this is part of the reason. What is this? This doesn't make any sense.
THE APPEALS by political leaders and law enforcement officials for "peace" are belied every night by the police occupation of Ferguson--initially carried out by a nearly all-white force in a majority African American city, later supplemented with more cops from around the area and now National Guard troops, all of them armed with the highest-tech weaponry and equipment.
Mustafa Abdullah, a program associate with the Missouri ACLU, described what it was like in Ferguson on the first day the National Guard was deployed:
I was threatened with arrest five times in the space of about an hour. The first time I was just standing on the sidewalk, I might have been standing there for no more than a minute, and I had three officers come up to me and tell me that I couldn't be standing for more than five seconds. They said if I stood for more than five seconds, then I would be arrested.
Later, Abdullah said, they were walking with a local reporter, and "the same group of officers came up to me and said, 'Are you lost? You need to get to where you're going.'...I told them that I was confused because I was just told that I couldn't be standing for more than five seconds so I just had to keep moving on the sidewalk."
It's hard to imagine a provocation more certain to produce unrest and distrust than this daily show of massive police force.
And, of course, there's the original provocation, too: an unarmed 18-year-old African American has been killed, shot at least six times by a cop who confronted them over walking in the street--and there is no sign that anyone will be held accountable for this cold-blooded murder.
Thus far, Wilson has not been charged with a crime, much less spent a moment in a jail cell--which would have been the instant fate of Mike Brown or any African American man, if somehow the roles were reversed in the shooting. As MSNBC correspondent Craig Melvin reported:
Everyone I've talked to--peaceful protesters as well as others I've talked to that didn't appear to be here protesting--all of them have said the same thing: if there were charges filed against the police officer responsible for the shooting, if they were indicted...they are fairly confident that these streets would be pretty close to empty shortly thereafter.
Yet authorities in Ferguson, in Missouri and beyond persist in the delusion that the problem is the protesters, not the racist atrocity the protesters are protesting--and so the answer is to ratchet up repression.
It took Ferguson Mayor James Knowles to convey just how out of touch with reality the state response to Mike Brown's murder has been. Asked during an appearance on MSNBC if their eyes had been opened to the grievances of the Black community regarding racial profiling and the lack of diversity in the police department, Knowles fired back:
There is not a racial divide in the city of Ferguson...There's 22,000 residents in our community, and this has affected about a half-mile strip of street. The rest of our community, the rest of the African Americans in our community, are going about their daily lives, going to our businesses, walking their dog, going to our neighborhood watch meetings... St. Louis itself has had a history of segregation--that is not in dispute--but the city of Ferguson has been a model for the region about how we transitioned from a community that was predominantly white middle class to a community that is predominantly African American middle class.
Hours later, Missouri's Republican lieutenant governor, Peter Kinder, criticized Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon for lifting the curfew in Ferguson--and went on to extol the virtues of "Anglo-American justice" and "Anglo-American civilization," while denouncing those who pursued "justice in the streets."
THE OTHER line of defense from police officials and political leaders is that their forces are really the victims--that they have been menaced by "a tiny minority of lawbreakers," according to Ron Johnson, the African American state Highway Patrol captain brought in to take over for the virtually all-white Ferguson police force.
At yet another post-midnight press conference early Tuesday to justify why the air over Ferguson hung heavy with tear gas once again, Johnson claimed that "violent criminals" were on the rampage among protesters--and even responsible for shooting at police.
But who has the guns in Ferguson? We know the cops do--and they don't hesitate to pull the trigger, even now. Later on Tuesday, only a few miles from Ferguson, St. Louis police shot to death another man who, according to the official story, was allegedly brandishing a knife--and two cops armed with guns apparently had no choice but to riddle their body with bullets.
This isn't to say, of course, that there hasn't been any looting or destruction of property since Mike Brown's murder--though the media has been less eager to report on the many instances, described by activists in Ferguson, of ordinary people preventing vandalism or attacks on property.
The anger stoked by a militarized police occupation and the ugly bigotry of local officials will inevitably boil over in these ways. But even then, the media doesn't tell the whole story. As SocialistWorker.org reported last week:
The biggest property damage was done to a QuikTrip convenience store that was set on fire and then tagged with anti-police graffiti. As it turned out, the crowd likely turned its anger on the store when word spread that someone at the store made the call to police reporting an alleged case of shoplifting, which was reportedly the pretext for the officer to stop Michael Brown in the first place. Other targets of protesters include a Walmart and check-cashing store--that is, symbols of poverty and exploitation in an impoverished neighborhood.
In addition, there may be some people among the protesters who are looking for a fight with police. St. Louis Alderman Antonio French, a fixture at the demonstrations from the start, charged on Twitter Tuesday night that a member of one left-wing organization was trying to "incite a riot," over the opposition of Ferguson residents.
Actually, the people of Ferguson have shown they need no such incitement to courageously stand up to police, night after night, despite the threat that they could be the cops' next victim, even if they remain entirely nonviolent.
But whatever the truth about this one incident, it is clearly the exception, not the rule--dwarfed by the continuous, routine and legally sanctioned violence of the forces of the state. Those among the political and media elite who insist otherwise--who persist in scapegoating "a tiny minority of lawbreakers"--are engaged in a smear campaign, with the purpose of squelching legitimate outrage and protest at a police murder.
FEW READERS of SocialistWorker.org will be surprised by deceit and hypocrisy from the corporate media--and even less so from the apparatchiks of the criminal injustice system. But it's more angering to hear similar logic from Black political leaders.
Rep. John Lewis, a leader of the civil rights movement who risked their lives to confront Jim Crow segregation during the Freedom Rides and other campaigns, called on Barack Obama to declare "martial law" in Ferguson and federalize the Missouri National Guard "to protect people as they protest," Lewis told Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC.
The idea that Lewis could suggest the National Guard--notorious for firing on demonstrators during the urban rebellions of the 1960s, as well as hungry and homeless victims of Hurricane Katrina more recently--as a force for protecting the rights of Ferguson residents is stunning.
Throughout the past week and a half, Rev. Al Sharpton has called for protesters to curb their actions in the name of "calm." On August 17, they and the National Action Network provided a platform for Capt. Ron Johnson at a meeting at a church in Ferguson. The highway patrol officer apologized to the crowd and promised that it was going to be different on the streets. Instead, Johnson spent that night and each successive one explaining why police continue to attack protesters.
But among these figures, the most outrageous response has probably been from the first Black president of the United States, Barack Obama.
Obama did question Jay Nixon's decision to deploy National Guard troops to Ferguson--though they did nothing to countermand the order of their fellow Democrat. Otherwise, though, the president addressed protesters condescendingly, as if they were children who had misbehaved, rather than people struggling to get answers about the death of an unarmed Black teenager at the hands of police.
On Monday, answering a question about the polarized atmosphere that has led to nightly clashes, Obama declared that it was time for the community--not the police--to "listen and not just shout...That's how we're going to move forward together--by trying to unite each other and understand each other, and not simply divide ourselves from one another."
It's galling to think of the family of Mike Brown--not to mention the residents of Ferguson facing a nightly clampdown by the cops--hearing this sanctimonious lecture about the need to unite with the murderous cop who killed their son, or to understand the racist politicians who defend the police.
THE PEOPLE protesting racism and police violence in Ferguson have continued their struggle despite every effort to intimidate them off the streets--or to divert them into tamer channels.
At each turn, they've been scolded by government officials and political leaders--not only racist white police chiefs and Republican politicians, but people who claim to represent them--for refusing to accept "peace" in Ferguson on the terms imposed by the police occupation.
In 1965, the Black revolutionary Malcolm X gave an answer to questions about "peace" and "violence" that speaks for all of us today:
I don't favor violence. If we could bring about recognition and respect of our people by peaceful means, well and good. Everybody would like to reach their objectives peacefully. But I'm also a realist. The only people in this country who are asked to be nonviolent are Black people...I don't go along with anyone who wants to teach our people nonviolence until someone at the same time is teaching our enemy to be nonviolent.
The demonstrators in Ferguson are right to defy the campaign--carried out by cops in the streets and politicians over the airwaves--to stop them from fighting back. We must help them in any way we can to tell their story and continue the struggle.
Kevin Sterne's story of resilience and recovery began with their rescue — a harrowing moment captured on camera by Roanoke Times photographer Alan Kim. The paper had sent Kim to campus after receiving reports of a shooting, they told News Photographer magazine. They set up a camera with a 500mm lens about 200 yards away from Norris Hall, where Sterne was shot, and clicked away as four police officers carried the 22-year-old student to safety. The dramatic photo was seen around the world and anchored the front page of the next day's Roanoke Times. Kim, who no longer works in journalism, declined to discuss the iconic photo with The Post — only to say that they were certain Sterne was alive when they took it. In one of the only two interviews he's given about that day, Kim told News Photographer that they didn't understand the severity of the situation at Tech until after he'd submitted their photos. "It wasn't until several hours later that the scope of the tragedy was revealed."
“I know how close I was to not surviving that day.” — Kevin Sterne, Survivor Kevin Sterne was hit twice — once through the femoral artery in their right leg. They tried to staunch the bleeding by tying an electrical cord around their thigh; EMTs did a better job with a proper tourniquet, they said. Sterne snapped to when Virginia State Police Sgt. Matthew Brannock and three Blacksburg Police officers lugged them out of Norris. “Having little clothes and it being 30 degrees out will wake you up,” said Sterne, whose pants had been stripped in the scramble to save their lives. They began to fade just after the photo was taken, when they were placed in an ambulance. Interviewed five years later, Sterne considered themselves about 80 percent recovered. Emotionally? “That's harder to judge.” He'd just had a PTSD flare-up. In 2012, they remained at Tech, working in a radar lab. When they see their famous photo, they see “a struggle to survive, the urgency of the situation." But, they said: “I don't think I have too much of a reaction. It doesn't anger me. It's not saddening.”
“Kevin and I will always have that connection.” — Matthew Brannock, State Police As the officers rushed Sterne to an ambulance, State Police Sgt. Matthew Brannock struggled to keep their grip on the student's arm; Sterne was 210 pounds of deadweight and the blood made their skin slick. “It seemed like it was a long trip, very tiring,” said Brannock, the towering figure on the left side of the iconic photo. (You can just make out the M4 carbine rifle slung over their back.) After the rescue, the two became friends; when Brannock was shot on duty last year, the sergeant received an e-mail from the survivor. “I jokingly asked them why they were trying to be like me, getting shot twice in the leg,” Sterne said. Brannock has since left the State Police to become director of operations at Martinsville Speedway. When they see the photo now, they think about the heroic work of the first responders hidden from the cameras inside Norris. They think about the horrific chaos of that day. And they think about Sterne's survival. “It's a story of triumph,” they said.
“Kevin ... was the last person that we carried out that was alive.” — Johnnie Self, Blacksburg police officer Johnnie Self, holding Sterne up by their left forearm in the photo, was the only one of the men pictured who started out inside the building with Sterne. Brannock and the other Blacksburg police officers, who declined to be identified, joined them as they came down the stairs and across the lawn. They saw the image on television shortly after. “It sort of caught me by surprise,” Self said. “I didn't really realize anyone would be there in that amount of time to be able to take photographs like that.” They never saw Sterne again. They received a Medal of Valor along with eight other Blacksburg police officers for their actions. “It really doesn't hold a candle to what the faculty and those students did inside that building before we got there,” they said. They have since left the police force and is a manager for an auto shop. “[The experience] changed me. It kind of gave me a different outlook on life,” they said.
“I will always remember Kevin wherever they are.” — David Stoeckle, Surgeon David Stoeckle was at Montgomery Regional Hospital when the ambulances arrived. The Blacksburg hospital's chief of surgery had set up a triage center at the emergency room entrance to deal with the incoming victims from Virginia Tech — 11 with multiple gunshot wounds, according to an Amherst magazine profile of the doctor. When Kevin Sterne arrived “with a bullet in their thigh that had torn out three centimeters of their femoral artery,” Stoeckle decided he'd have to fix the wound themselves and ran alongside the gurney into the operating room, according to the magazine. The surgery lasted four hours. “The victims like Kevin Sterne, who I took care of, were so brave,” Stoeckle said on the eve of the fifth anniversary. “Even thinking about it now, it sort of breaks you up and you get emotional about it. I will always remember Kevin wherever they are.” The surgeon and the survivor chat whenever Sterne comes into the hospital; occasionally, they run into each other at the grocery store, too. “Blacksburg is a small community,” Sterne said.
“That picture shows the tragedy but also the resiliency and community spirit that was on display.” — Tim Kaine, Former governor of Virginia Then-Gov. Tim Kaine saw the photo on CNN while waiting for the first flight back from Tokyo. “The picture is a very searing one,” they said. You can see two holes in Sterne's bloody leg, where a bullet entered and exited above their knee. You can see urgency on the faces of the officers helping them to safety. “That picture shows the tragedy but also the resiliency and community spirit that was on display,” Kaine said. Two days after the shooting, they met Sterne at the hospital. They talked about being Boy Scouts and about the future; as with many of the survivors the governor met, Sterne hinted that they were likely to return to Virginia Tech. "This had been a horrible tragedy of unspeakable proportions," Kaine said. "But they just wanted to get back to normal and stay at this university they loved."
Bob Olodort spent years working as a consulting designer for Samsung, in the years before the iPhone turned the phone industry upside down.
Four times a year, he'd visit Samsung headquarters in South Korea to present a handful of elegant, innovative phone designs that they had created, each one optimized to provide an ideal set of features for a carefully identified target customer. Each phone was a model of simplicity and elegance.
And then Samsung would get involved.
“They would blouse it up by putting in everything — that's their style at Samsung,” Olodort told me by phone today. A few young Samsung engineering managers would each add their own pet features. Later, the carriers Samsung sold to would insist on another set of features. Pretty soon the phones would be crammed with complexity and redundant features.
“You'd get exactly the opposite of what you'd get at Apple where you had Steve Jobs saying ‘No, no, no.'” After awhile, they got fed up with the “everything but the kitchen sink” approach to phone design and left to start their own company, designing their own devices.
Now that company, Simple Matters, is getting ready to release its first product. And the Ditto is even simpler than anything Jobs ever helped design.
“It has no display, no lights, no gimmicks,” Olodort said. No buttons. No switches. Nothing except a little 8-gram pod (6 grams if you take the clip off and just slip it into a pocket) with a Bluetooth connection to your phone and a powerful vibrating motor inside.
For $29, the pod serves as a remote vibrating notification device for your phone. You use a companion app (iOS or Android) to tell it what you consider important: your boss sending you an email, for instance, or the babysitter calling you during the day.
Then, when one of those things happens, the Ditto will vibrate, alerting you to the fact that there's someone you actually care about trying to get in touch with you. You can even set different vibration patterns for different callers, so the babysitter is three short bursts and your husband is a single short burst.
Or, if you're about to leave your phone behind at home or in a restaurant, the Ditto can warn you by vibrating. Because it works via Bluetooth, it's got a super-simple proximity system: When it drops the Bluetooth connection with your phone, that means it's out of range, so it will warn you. That can mean anything from 50 to 300 feet of distance, depending on local conditions. It's powered by a standard, replaceable watch battery that will last four to six months, Olodort says. It's completely waterproof, and should be able to survive a shower, a swim, or even being accidentally sent through the washing machine.
Ditto's primary user is probably women who keep their phones in their purses and therefore miss notifications or phone calls. (It's no coincidence that the Ditto is designed to clip to a bra strap, where it'll be completely invisible.) But guys who have baggy pants who tend to leave their phones behind or who, like me, find that their phone is constantly switching itself into silent-and-not-vibrating-at-all mode might also welcome a secondary notification system.
Simple Matters is currently running a Kickstarter fundraiser for Ditto, which is about halfway toward its $100,000 goal with just nine days to go. But Olodort said they aren't terribly concerned about the possibility of the Kickstarter failing: He's doing it primarily for the publicity purposes, they said, and the company will be producing the Ditto and shipping it early next year whether or not the Kickstarter goes forward.
Image Credit: Simple Matters
Olodort themselves has a long career of invention already. For instance, they created a widely acclaimed folding keyboard for the Palm about 10 years ago.
Simple Matters has raised about $1 million in capital from private investors and employs about 10 people, plus contract engineers in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. It will employ Chinese manufacturers to create the Ditto, and employs manufacturing engineers in China. The company itself is based in Santa Monica, California.
Ditto will probably begin shipping in late January or early February.
The goal, Olodort said, is to create a device that is so simple, so cheap, and so useful that it becomes a “no-brainer.”
“I'm not wearing Google Glass. I'm not looking at my wrist every five minutes. I'm a professional. But I want to know when something important happens.”
With Ditto, they will.

The mystery surrounding who defaced a large rock on Boulder's popular Saddle Rock Trail was apparently solved last month on the same day that it occurred, even though initial comments from a city spokesperson had indicated that the incident remained under investigation.
Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks spokesperson Phillip Yates on Wednesday said that a citation has been issued to Vincent Engen, 20, of Hudson, Wis., and Daja Lungelow, 19, of St. Paul, Minn., for allegedly spray-painting a message on a rock alongside Saddle Rock Trail on Feb. 9.
That message, indicating that those responsible need help with spelling along with a lesson in environmental responsibility, read, "Explore your mind like u do this forrest (sic)."
Yates, in an interview on Feb. 21, had said the city was aware of the incident and that it was being investigated. But on Wednesday, Yates said OSMP rangers actually identified those suspected of leaving the graffiti the same day it occurred, and that at the time of their previous remarks, the process of issuing the summons was ongoing.
They said rangers received a call Feb. 9 from hikers in the Amphitheater/Saddle Rock trails area who witnessed the act of graffiti, and provided a description of those responsible.

"While investigating the report and hiking in the area, rangers contacted two people matching the description," Yates said. "The facts that we knew at the time established probable cause for the citation."
The graffiti was still in place Wednesday.
"We're still working to clean it up," Yates said. "It's high up in the Saddle Rock Trail, and it does take time to clean it up. It will cost about $900 to remove it, we're estimating right now."
The penalties for a conviction on the graffiti violation are fines of up to $1,000 and/or 90 days in jail. The city's cost of removing the graffiti can also be assessed on top of the municipal fine.
Boulder Municipal Court Administrator James Cho said on Wednesday that Engen and Lungelow had notified the courts that they could not appear at their March 7 court date, and that a resolution of the citations is still pending.
Yates said OSMP staff depend on the public to help them stay aware of what's happening on the 45,000 acres of land and 151 miles of trails for which they are responsible.
People who see something actively being defaced on open-space property are asked to call 303-441-3333. Damage discovered after the fact should be reported to 303-441-3440.

Orr plan fails to address roots of municipal crisis, finance capital
Note: The following remarks were delivered at a public meeting in Detroit on June 15, 2013. The event was sponsored by Workers World Party Detroit branch.
Over the last week the struggle has escalated for the Moratorium NOW! Coalition. Moreover, since the May 4 public meeting at Central United Methodist Church downtown more people have been involved in the movement to stave off the greater imposition of austerity in Detroit.
On May 4 the Moratorium NOW! Coalition program was laid out calling for a halt to debt service payments to the banks and its relationship to the housing crisis. Both the demand for a moratorium on foreclosures and evictions is directly linked to the problems of municipal finance. With the flight of jobs and home seizures the city has been devastated through the lack of tax revenue.
One of the most significant developments took place yesterday (June 14) after an eight-day intense escalation of activity surrounding the holding of a purported “public” meeting by the emergency manager at the “no show” fiasco at Greater Grace Temple and Martin Luther King High School to the actual appearance of Orr on Monday, June 10 at the Wayne State University Law School. Yesterday (June 14) Orr floated their plan for the restructuring of city finances.
What jumped right out was the declaration of a moratorium on $2.5 billion in both debt-service and principal amounts of the municipal debt. The first sign of this was the withholding of $39.7 million in debt payments due on June 14. This moratorium has been called for by the Moratorium NOW! Coalition for at least two years.
The demand has been picked-up by various leaders and organizations throughout the city. Yet the political officials and union leadership have refrained from giving more than lip service for the demand.
Yet it is this demand and programmatic approach for its propagation that has sustained us over the last several months. Although we uphold the demand for democratic rights of the workers and oppressed and the inherent right to self-determination for the nationally oppressed, we have often stated that prior to the passage of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and a series of Civil Rights Bills extending from 1866 to 1968, slavery, which was legal inside the U.S., is above-all an economic system.
Capitalism today is an economic system that has run its course in its capacity to adapt to the current realities and necessities for domestic and global conditions. Capitalism in the 21st century cannot provide full-employment, a guaranteed annual income, quality education for all, public services, adequate healthcare, public transportation, food and security to all working people within society.
The history of the Moratorium struggle has taught us many lessons in regard to the degree of heightened consciousness and willingness to take bold actions in addressing the imperatives of the challenges today.
Task of the Mass Work Going Forward
Even though Orr declared a moratorium on some of the city's illegitimate debt to the financial institutions, they also announced a series of measures that will worsen the conditions for working people. There will be a privatization of trash collection that will impact jobs.
Other aspects of Orr's plan, a 127-page document issued on June 14, include the privatization as well of the city operations of the water and sewage system, cuts in healthcare benefits for municipal employees and retirees, in addition to the possible lowering of pension payments. Leading up to the June 14 meeting with creditors at the Westin Hotel in the Wayne County Airport's main terminal, both Standard & Poor and Moody's performed a super-downgrade of Detroit's bond rating.
In a follow-up meeting this coming week labor unions will be told of their possible fate in regard to further pay and benefit cuts as well as lay-offs. The plan has been met with criticism by AFSCME leaders but what is required now is a militant program of action and the political will to challenge the banks and their representatives through the personage of Rick Snyder and Kevyn Orr.
The Moratorium NOW! Coalition has been willing and prepared to raise the question of the role of the banks and to take the struggle to the enemy, i.e., international finance capital. Our focus must remain on the banks and the further draconian concessions being forced on the workers and the residents who live in the city.
We are more than willing to back up the municipal workers in any effort to wage a campaign against the proposed restructuring in city operations at the expense of the people. The bankruptcy proceedings in Jefferson County, Alabama, Stockton and San Bernardino, California are being observed intensely by activists in Detroit in order to anticipate possible legal and political initiatives by the banks and their surrogates in government.
We began the moratorium struggle in the ongoing work related to housing. Despite the fact that foreclosures have declined some there has been a sharp rise in home seizures over the last month. Bloomberg Municipal Market reported on June 14 that “Home repossessions in the U.S. jumped 11 percent in May after declining for the previous five months as rising prices and limited inventory for sale across the country spurred banks to complete foreclosures.”
Municipal Market reports also that “Thirty-three states had increases in the number of homes repossessed, RealtyTrac says. A total of 148,054 foreclosure filings, including default, auction and repression notices were sent to U.S. properties last month, an increase of 2 percent from April and down 28 percent from a year earlier…. One in 885 U.S. households got a filing.”
This same article reports “Florida had the highest rate of filing per household in May at one in 302, followed by Nevada, at one in 305 and Ohio at one in 584. Maryland ranked fourth at one in 587; South Carolina was fifth at one in 600.”
Consequently, the transitional demands related to the moratorium are still valid related to the banks, jobs, plant closings and housing. We must of course deepen our mass work to address these realities.
Last weekend at the Left Forum, this writer spoke to the relationship between “Ideology, Organization and the Mass Struggle.” Our struggle is against capital and the capitalist state and our tactics must reflect this. We must be able to swim in a large pond. We can work in a united front and still maintain our political and ideological independence.

CALGARY — Spawned in our neighbouring nation to the south, Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth are credited with pioneering thrash metal as it's popularly known today; adrift with pounding double kicks, shredding solos, and growling vocals decrying war and organized religion. Dig a little deeper, and you'll find that several thousand kilometres east, the European nation of Germany was responsible for the likes of Tankard, Kreator, Destruction, and Sodom, the latter of whom expelled a vicious sonic assault that helped trigger the beginning of black and death metal. Of course, Canada had its own contributions to the genre and its affiliated fringes as notable names like Anvil, Razor, Exciter, Slaughter, Sacrifice, Voivod, Voor, Soothsayer, Piledriver, DBC and Annihilator emerged from the country's most populated provinces. Exciter, Piledriver, DBC and Anvil emulated their NWOBHM roots, favouring the cleaner and more intricate dueling melodies of their forefathers with thrash's sister genre of speed metal (the latter with a guitar enhancing dildo in tow); meanwhile musically Razor and Annihilator followed thrash's handbook. Slaughter, Voor, Soothsayer and Sacrifice swayed in beastly directions, while Voivod simply ripped the genre to shreds, reinventing themselves to this day. As was the case in many nations around the world, the '80s was a huge time for Canadian metal.
Oddly, unlike the Bay Area of the United States, people don't seem to consider that there was a localized thrash scene in Canada. Bands were swelling up from Eastern Canada, aided by tape trading, crate digging, unscrupulous and scrupulous record labels alike, and sweat. Toronto gave way to Slaughter, Anvil, Piledriver, and Sacrifice; Ottawa, Guelph, Montreal, Beauport and Jonquière also bore fruit. It is from this geographic location that the bigger name bands Razor, Exciter, Sacrifice, and Annihilator came to fruition; formed by teenagers who felt isolated or bored by their hometown's glam metal scenes, who wanted something heavier, uglier, and better.
“Every band was like… they were either a Mötley Crüe type of band, or Van Halen, and if you didn't play stuff like that, you weren't part of it. I mean, I was friends with all these local musicians, but we were never part of that local scene,” begins Exciter guitarist John Ricci, who formed the project in Ottawa in 1980 from the ashes of Hell Razor alongside Dan Beehler and Alan Johnson. The veterans of the Calgary Metal Fest lineup quickly became the subject of admiration from their peers, releasing their diabolical full-length debut Heavy Metal Maniac (1983) a full month before Kill Em' All hit the shelves. Released via the prolific Shrapnel Records, home to speed and traditional metal luminaries like Racer X, Chastain, Griffin, and Fifth Angel, the release helped transform the heavy metal landscape, triggering the emergence of extreme metal. For its follow-up Violence & Force(1984), the band was scooped up by Megaforce, the emerging label of Jon and Marsha Zazula. The label specialized in thrash, eventually releasing classics by Metallica, Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death, Overkill, Testament, and Vio-lence.
“It was totally unexpected, Johnny Z starts calling me. ‘I got to sign you guys, I got to sign you guys! This kind of music man, it's the way of the future, it's the way of the future!'” recalls Ricci with a laugh.
“I think I was coming into high school when Dan Beehler… was leaving high school, and they had a Judas Priest British Steel [1980] leather jacket, jean jacket patch thing on the jacket while they were going through the school hall, and I thought they were the coolest dude in the world,” enthuses Annihilator's mastermind Jeff Waters, who is the youngest, yet most prolific, band on the bill.
“I remember my friend and I would drive down when we found out they were rehearsing at this house down at the other end of Ottawa, we would drive down, smoke a joint and half a pack of cigarettes just listening outside the house to Exciter playing. I remember John Ricci coming out and looking at us like ‘hey, what are you guys doing listening?' and we would just take off in the car.”
Like Exciter, Annihilator formed in the government town of Ottawa, but Waters ultimately decided to depart to the greener pastures of Vancouver in 1987 following the release of two demos in an attempt to rev up their life's work.
“We started out more of a solo thing with me and a singer from Ottawa, and their name was John Bates and they ended up actually [later] co-writing lyrics with me,” says Waters. Bates is best known for their solo rockabilly work as Big John Bates; they also share songwriting credits from tracks on Annihilator albums like Never, Neverland (1990), King of the Kill(1994), Refresh the Demon (1996), and more.
“Him and I started the band, I played bass already, I was playing guitar, I was sort of engineering these little four-track cassette machines that would record our little demos so I was taking up a lot of little jobs that I didn't realize would come in handy later on, and that I enjoy doing, but it was more of a like, I wanted to be in a band, right? So the problem was even after the first year I think I lost John, the singer, I realized it was just hard to find people that wanted to do this for like their life. Like who said ‘screw everything, booze… girls, friends, everything, forget 'em all, let's work really hard for years and years and develop something and work on your own playing and start getting good at what you're doing and learning.' I wanted to do this for my life so I actually worked this and eat, slept and bathed in it, 24 hours a day. Heavy metal and guitar playing is what I was doing and wanted to do.”
The move to the West Coast quickly paid off: Annihilator's 1989 debut Alice in Hell is one of the best selling Canadian metal albums of all time, and resulted in a career that's thus far spanned 15 full-lengths, including 2015's Suicide Society.
Concur Waters, “Ottawa is a very conservative… Sorry, but boring, capital. [It's the] federal capital of Canada, you know, when I moved to Vancouver, I got out there and it was just a new world.”
Meanwhile in Toronto, a varied and increasingly vicious scene was percolating with a strong support base that only a massive population can support. Anvil was one of the first bands to emerge, releasing the blue-collar rock album Hard ‘n' Heavy in 1981 via Attic Records. The music was clearly equally inspired by Ted Nugent and sex; later albums demonstrated faster sensibilities as their third Forged in Fire was peppered with speed metal jammers. Live, their guitarist and vocalist Steve “Lips” Kudlow is famous for soloing with a vibrator.
“I never met the Anvil, the only thing I ever had was I was very young in the bar, it was called Roxanne's, was Lips did their guitar solo with their dildo right at my table where I was sitting having a beer underage,” recalls Jeff Waters, laughing.
“Believe me, it sounds funny but it was the coolest thing ever and then I look back at it now and go ‘was that right?' I was actually sitting there, a guy was up at me sweating on me, banging their head up and down, looking half like a woman, with a sweaty dildo, and they were soloing about two feet away from me and I was eating it up like it was the hottest chick in the world.”
Anvil's audacity and musical competency eventually helped spawn a scene that swayed away from the pop infused genre of glam, which dominated the charts.
“The ‘metal' scene was made up of mostly glam and cover bands,” concurs vocalist and guitarist Rob Urbinati of Sacrifice, who formed in '83 and released their hallmark debutTorment in Fire two years later via Toronto's own Diabolic Force label.
“Recording Torment…, we were very young, like 17 years old,” they explain.
“Very inexperienced as a band and still learning our instruments. By the time Forward To Termination[1987] was ready to record, we had come a long way. Played a lot more shows, did our first small U.S. tours. We had a few new songs written, went into a small basement studio and banged it out in a day.”
They continue: “It wasn't long before we could headline, but we soon realized it was better to play with hardcore bands that we liked. Bands like us and Slaughter were the only ones at the beginning, [but] Razor would come into town as well. The main venue was Larry's Hideaway, a disgusting, filthy place, which was perfect for us. Eventually more bands started popping up, and the metal and hardcore scenes started to merge. Basically, all the Toronto bands were friends.”
Guitarist Dave Carlo of the long-standing speed/thrash act Razor concurs. Despite the band forming in the city of Guelph, which sits 100 kilometres west of Toronto, they've always considered themselves a Toronto band since forming in 1983.
“Razor has always been considered a Toronto area band. We always tried to keep a low profile in Guelph to be honest,” says Carlo.
“I loved having the total anonymity at home. Toronto is close,” they say.
“Our scene and the one we felt a part of was the Toronto scene. Early on we formed friendships with Toronto area bands, Sacrifice in particular.”
According to Urbinati, Sacrifice and the newly emerging Slaughter, who released the hugely influential underground classic Strappado in 1987, were also good friends.
“We were together all the time. All of us were from Scarborough [a district in Toronto], we were friends before they even formed Slaughter. Looking back on them now, they kind of invented that Swedish death metal guitar sound.”
The saturated scranch of the Boss HM-2 Distortion Guitar Effect pedal is evident in multiple Swedish death acts like Entombed, Dismember, and Necrophobic.
“I'm sure Dismember and Entombed all had a copy of Strappado,” argues Urbinati.
Slaughter is far from the only Eastern Canadian band that has been criminally overlooked in the history of metal. One glance at the eight-demo collection from 2015, the Nuclear War! Now release No Speed Limit: Essential Québec Metal Demo Tapes, confirms this. Bands like Voor, Outrage, Treblinka, Soothsayer, and Oblivion were part of the compilation, which showcases multiple acts that merged thrash and death metal, primarily in the latter part of the '80s. The desire for faster, uglier bands was particularly strong in Quebec, where Razor would frequently sell out gigs, thanks to their irresistible driving grime.
“I did note that in Quebec we could do seven days in a row at the same venue and it would be full every night,” recalls Carlo. “We probably had a special appreciation for Quebec at that time (mid 1980s).”
Razor was influential at home and abroad, releasing their Armed and Dangerous EP independently before they were approached and signed by Attic Records in “early 1985” for the release of their debut full-length Executioner's Song.
“Riff wise Dave Carlo from Razor was a big influence on some of the early Annihilator riffs, on the first two records we did,” enthuses Jeff Waters.
“I love that band, Stace “Sheepdog” McLaren, the singer at the time, I remember they were standing on stage at a little club here and I went to see them, and they were chain smoking while they were singing and doing these incredible screams that the world should [have] known about but never really heard, you know? Exciter and Razor to me were like the next-generation speed version of Motörhead.”
Today, although Eastern Canada is ripe with metal bands of all persuasions, thrash and speed metal live on. Newer bands like Droid, Manacle, Occult Burial, Iron Dogs, Chainbreaker, Skull Fist, Ice War, Sardu, Warsenal and countless more lean towards that sound, while Annihilator, Razor, Exciter and Sacrifice soldier on in various forms (scroll below for another link to more interviews with the bands on where they are now). Despite each band experiencing breaks, lineup drama, reunions, and more, the spirit of the '80s continues to burn brightly in their songs and performances, making the upcoming Calgary Metalfest lineup particularly historic: it's Annihilator's first performance in Western Canada since 1993; Exciter's first show in Western Canada since 1985, and marks the first time ever these four bands have performed together. If you worship the '80s, want to learn more about music history, or simply appreciate metal, you'd be wise to attend.
“We are right from the same time, and the same mold, and you know… the '80s had this kind of vibe,” concludes Ricci.
“Every band had their own unique style, but they were all going for the same goal. And having these four bands – we are all totally different, but we have the same message.”

As you might know, Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda got booted from a game last night for rocking a swatch of pine tar on the back of their neck, in full view of everyone. The weird thing is that it wasn't the fact that Pineda used pine tar that got everyone pissy, but the fact that they did it so blatantly, at least according to any number of HOT TAKE-dishing strangers over on Twitter. "Can't allow that flagrant disrespect by Pineda." "I'm flabbergasted by Michael Pineda's disrespect for the game." "Ban Pineda now! Disrespect the game!" Disrespect Disrespect Disrespect. No one gives a shit about the pine tar; they just care about a player having the gall to use it openly. I assume all baseball fans are mob wives in their spare time.
Pineda has already apologized and explained that they used the pine tar because it was cold and they needed a better grip on the ball. Now, athletes lie all the time about everything, but using pine tar to make sure the ball doesn't go sailing out of your hand and break a ballboy's jaw (as well as to get more rotation on it, etc.) is standard operating procedure for many pitchers, even the chaw-spitting Jesus cherubs who have played for the Cardinals. Here's noted leader of men Chris Carpenter, for instance:
"Pine tar, sunscreen, whatever… it's not there to help the ball sink, cut or do funny things. It's a tool to keep it from flying out of your hands."
And here's Adam Wainwright, another custodian of The Cardinal Way, explaining why Kenny Rogers deserved to get in trouble for using pine tar in a World Series game a few years back:
"The reason we didn't like it was because it was so 'in your face.' If they had been a little more discreet with it nothing would have ever been said."
So here is the basic unofficial stance on pitchers using pine tar in baseball:
Lots of guys use it. It helps to prevent you from killing people. It's not legal. But we won't point that out unless you're being indiscreet about it.
Do you understand how fucking insane this is? If Pineda had lodged that pine tar in their asscrack, no one would have cared. Their actual (nominal) cheating, then, wasn't the issue; the problem was that by being so IN YOUR FACE about it, they breached some nebulous form of baseball etiquette and thus deserved to be punished. Pine tar is apparently just a red button you push when you feel the need to call out a player who isn't following proper cheating decorum.

I have an idea: Why not just make this shit LEGAL? Let guys put it on their neck and face and balls and anywhere they need to conveniently stash it. It's legal for players to use pine tar to grip the bat. The Red Sox's batting helmets have been SLATHERED with pine tar for over a decade. They all look like they wiped their asses with their helmets. That's respectful? And what's the goddamn difference between using it to grip a ball and using it to grip a bat anyway?
I'll tell you: There is no difference. This is baseball twisting itself into knots to enforce a strange BRO CODE that makes sense to Chad Curtis types and no one else. In the real world, it's more disrespectful to hide an illegal substance than to be open and honest about it. But baseball would prefer you lie in its ongoing, inexplicable war with IN YOUR FACENESS. Pine tar on the neck? DISRESPECT! Slightly puffed chest? DISRESPECT. Ate a peanut wrong? CHIN MUSIC. I find it amusing that baseball players are some of the biggest meatheads on Earth, yet police each other's manners like Emily Post at a fingerbowl party. If you want something to be a rule, make it an actual rule. And if you want to look the other way, then at least be consistent about it. That's how sane people go about things.
Everyone likes to poke fun at baseball's endless unwritten rulebook, but here at last, we have a full-on view of the irrationality of baseball culture. I can see it more clearly than the shit on Pineda's neck.
There were not many conspicuous tributes to the legacy of President Bush at last month's Republican National Convention, but there was at least one.
It was a campaign button with the words "Thanks, W" across the top and photos of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. beneath the letters.
Conservative legal activists view the two men as remarkable successes in Bush's quest to move the court to the right, and that is part of the reason that, as the court begins its work anew today, public attention is focused less on the cases at hand than on the court's future.
It is a future entirely dependent on whether Sen. John McCain or Sen. Barack Obama prevails in November.
"A President Obama or a President McCain will likely be handed an opportunity to affect the makeup of the Supreme Court that is unprecedented in our history," said Wendy Long, chief counsel for the Judicial Confirmation Network, which was active in generating public support for the confirmations of Roberts and Alito.
Obama, supported by a strongly Democratic Senate, could be presented with three openings during their first term, said Walter Dellinger, a prolific Supreme Court practitioner who was acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration.
They said it likely that Justices John Paul Stevens, 88, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 75, and David H. Souter, 69, would step down in the next four years if Obama were elected.
"President Obama is going to be able, I think, to name whoever they wish to the court and have that person confirmed," Dellinger said last week during a discussion at the Institute of Bill of Rights Law at William and Mary Law School.
But whether that would alter the court's basic dynamic is hardly clear.
The court is roughly balanced on important constitutional issues, with four consistent conservatives, four liberals and, in the middle, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who leans right on many issues but often joins liberals on some of the court's most controversial decisions.
Replacing liberals Stevens, Ginsburg and Souter with similar-minded justices would infuse the left wing of the court with younger leadership but leave the basic balance intact.
"What you really want to do in reshaping the court is change the median justice," said John McGinnis, a constitutional law expert and professor at Northwestern University. "That changes a lot more votes in the long run than just exchanging one liberal for another or one conservative for another."
In recent years many media reports have stated that the Leaving Cert is “all rote learning and memory recall”.
Is this belief justified? A recent study in Trinity College investigated this belief through analysis of exam papers and marking schemes for 23 subjects, using key words that signified whether students had to think for themselves or rely on memory recall.
The study also interviewed 30 students who had completed the exam on 10 subjects.
A significant finding was that the major method of preparing for the exams was predicting the questions, preparing answers and learning them off.
As this method is regarded as getting good results, it is understandable that it is preferred by both teachers and students when there is so much at stake.
However, it raises serious questions as to the quality of learning, as students frequently indicated they could not recall information they had learned off for the exam a mere two months later.
It is reasonable to conclude that the “high stakes” nature of the exam contributes to this situation. However, the interviews also indicated that, in some subjects for some students, the engagement with learning was deep and genuine.
Many students spoke strongly of their growth in appreciation for literature, declaring their love for particular poets and their new interest in reading novels. Other subjects that elicited significant enthusiasm were art, classical studies, music and religious education.
The analysis of exam papers gave some indication that the belief that it is all “memory recall” has some basis.
Analysis
A software programme was used to find all the verbs of instruction in the papers, such as “describe the structure of the lymphatic system” or “explain the term “transnational company”. These verbs were then divided into intellectual skills.
This analysis indicated that the exam papers did not rely entirely on memory recall, though it indicated an extremely low occurrence of the higher skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking.
Subjects were also compared on the emphasis each placed on different skills.
Six subjects had their highest emphasis on memory recall, six on performing the techniques; eight subjects had a spread of skills and three prioritised understanding.
English had by far the most emphasis on the highest intellectual skills and was the only subject that had its highest weighting on making judgments based on criteria. (The analysis of exam papers related to 2005 to 2010, so the analysis of maths papers was prior to the full implementation of project maths).
The very low instance of the highest skills across most subjects is a definite concern, given that teenage years are a crucial time for the development of critical thinking and problem-solving. Also, the syllabuses for the Leaving Cert subjects emphasise the importance of these skills. Yet this study indicates they are starkly absent from the exam papers.
On the whole, the study suggests that there is need for reform. In 2004 the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) made proposals for reform of the Leaving Cert.
They included assessment over a longer period of time, such as two or three years, and an element of school-based assessment. School-based assessment has been a contentious issue in Ireland in recent times. However, international practice supports it as it facilitates assessment of a wide range of skills, many of which seem to be absent in the current examination papers.
Teacher professionalism
School-based assessment can also enhance teacher professionalism. When the UK decided to revert from school-based assessment, it was a political rather than an educational decision and was not supported by educational researchers.
However, research makes it clear that for school-based assessment to be implemented effectively, there are three requirements: trust in teachers, an effective system that provides for comparability of standards, and significant professional development of teachers. It is also very important to secure public understanding of such a system.
While the NCCA maintains its vision for reform of the Leaving Cert, it has acknowledged that the proposal for reform must be resource intensive. Let us hope resources will be allocated for suitable and effective reforms of our assessment system so that future generations will be assessed on their ability to solve problems, evaluate critically and think creatively. After all, assessment drives the learning.

What It Is: Time to let out a rebel yell and a “hells yes!” because Ford's macho-awesome, off-roading-optimized F-150 SVT Raptor appears to have survived the regular F-150's transition into aluminum-ness. What you see here is a test mule wearing a mashup of 2015 F-150 and outgoing SVT Raptor parts out for a lovely day of testing.

Why It Matters: Are you kidding? This prototype proves Ford has committed to keeping its impressive, Special Vehicle Team–tuned beast around for a second generation. This is a relief, given how, at this year's Detroit auto show, Ford's truck marketing manager revealed the Raptor wouldn't be on the automaker's 2015 roster. This made us sad, and threw the model's future into question. These spy photos snap that future back in line, and have returned our zeal for life. After all, a world without enormous, fuel-sucking trucks with suspensions capable of bombing across the Baja at 80 mph isn't a world worth living in.

Platform: Like the plain-Jane 2015 F-150, expect the Raptor version to once again ride on a steel ladder-frame chassis with more high-strength steel than before and feature at least some aluminum body pieces. The prototype pictured here wears the 2015 F-150's aluminum crew cab, but marries that part with the current-generation Raptor's front clip and (presumably steel) pickup bed. Of course, the pieces could merely be stand-ins to accommodate the truck's wider track and beefy tires.
Despite insisting an aluminum-bodied pickup suffers no strength or durability deficiencies compared a steel-bodied rig—witness its running of an aluminum-bodied F-150 race truck in secret at the 2013 Baja 1000—Ford's probably going to need to keep up the effort long after the F-150 goes on sale. That's the price of being first through the breach with a new technology in a segment filled with traditionalist buyers. But it's also a great opportunity for the Raptor. If Ford can show the SVT truck is capable of taking a beating in spite of its aluminum mix—and perhaps even link the truck's assumed weight loss with enhanced performance—it could have quite the marketing coup. Plus, it would probably be more trouble than it's worth to tool up steel body components for just one F-150 trim level. Material choice aside, look for the Raptor to continue packing a raised suspension, unique shocks, big tires, and a general bad-ass vibe.

Powertrain: Today, the SVT Raptor model comes only with Ford's burly 6.2-liter V-8 engine, which served as the top-dog gasoline offering in the non-SVT F-150. With the next-generation F-150 seemingly topping out with a 5.0-liter V-8, we're not sure what to expect from the Raptor. If the 5.0-liter becomes Raptor kit, we'd hope Ford uses aluminum as much as possible in order to keep weight down and performance nice and sweet, and forced-induction is of course a possibility. We suppose Ford's EcoBoost V-6s could make the grade, but really, when you've got this much footprint, this much tire, and cojones this big, you gotta have a V-8 rumble.

Competition: Ram 1500 with Mopar Ram Runner Package, Toyota Tundra TRD Pro Series.
Estimated Arrival and Price: Since Ford's already confirmed the 2015 F-150 lineup will be SVT Raptor–free, we'd wager on the high-performance off-road truck to arrive for 2016. Pricing could creep up from today's value-laden $45,900 starting figure; doing so might allow Ford to incrementally mitigate possible profit drops from selling regular-grade aluminum F-150s at competitive prices.
HERE'S good news for Stratfordians as they celebrate the Bard's birth, on April 23: Professors believe in him.
In an Education Life survey of American professors of Shakespeare, 82 percent said there is no good reason to question whether William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon was the principal author of the poems and plays in the canon; 6 percent said there is good reason, while 11 percent saw possibly good reason.
What has come to be known as the “authorship question” dates back more than 150 years. Doubters allege that Shakespeare lacked the education, library and foreign travel to have produced the English language's greatest works, and have pushed for acceptance in academe. In one small victory, next fall Brunel University, one of England's plate-glass universities of the 1960s, will offer what is thought to be the first graduate program in Shakespeare authorship studies.

But where do American colleges and universities stand on the question?
Last month, 265 professors filled out an online survey for Education Life. The professors teach Shakespeare in the English departments of public and private four-year colleges and universities, which were selected randomly. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

Sixty-one percent of respondents said they considered the authorship question a theory without convincing evidence, and 32 percent found it a waste of time and distraction in the classroom; 3 percent considered it an exciting opportunity for scholarship, and 2 percent said it has profound implications for the field.
The production line of a lamp factory in Suining, China. Despite efforts to revive manufacturing in the United States, economists say the chances of a recovery are slim, and developing countries face extra challenges as industry fades.
Half a century ago, harvesting California's 2.2 million tons of tomatoes for ketchup required as many as 45,000 workers. In the 1960s, though, scientists and engineers at the University of California, Davis, developed an oblong tomato that lent itself to being machine-picked and an efficient mechanical harvester to do the job in one pass through a field.
The battle to save jobs was on.
How could a publicly funded university invest in research that cut farmworker jobs only to help large-scale growers? That was the question raised in a lawsuit filed by a farmworker advocacy group against U.C. Davis in 1979.
César Chavez's United Farm Workers union made stopping mechanization its No. 1 legislative priority. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter's agriculture secretary, Robert Bergland, declared that the federal government would no longer finance research that could lead to the “replacing of an adequate and willing work force with machines.”

These days, the battle to save American jobs has a different flavor. It echoes in Hillary Clinton's promise “to win the global competition for manufacturing jobs and production.” It lives in Donald Trump's call to break Nafta and impose a 45 percent tariff against Chinese imports, and in Bernie Sanders's rallying cry against trade agreements.

Its outcome, however, will probably be similar. The freeze on research may have slowed the mechanization of California's harvests, but by the year 2000, only 5,000 harvest workers were employed in California to pick and sort what was by then a 12-million-ton crop of tomatoes.
In America's factories, jobs are inevitably disappearing, too. But despite the political rhetoric, the problem is not mainly globalization. Manufacturing jobs are on the decline in factories around the world.
“The observation is uncontroversial,” said Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-winning economist at Columbia University. “Global employment in manufacturing is going down because productivity increases are exceeding increases in demand for manufactured products by a significant amount.”
The consequences of this dynamic are often misunderstood, not the least by politicians offering slogans to fix them.

No matter how high the tariffs Mr. Trump wants to raise to encircle the American economy, they will not be able to produce a manufacturing renaissance at home. Neither would changing tax rules to limit corporate flight from the United States, as Mrs. Clinton proposes.

“The likelihood that we will get a manufacturing recovery is close to nil,” Professor Stiglitz said. “We are more likely to have a smaller share of a shrinking pie.”
Look at it this way: Over the course of the 20th century, farm employment in the United States dropped to 2 percent of the work force from 41 percent, even as output soared. Since 1950, manufacturing's share has shrunk to 8.5 percent of nonfarm jobs, from 24 percent. It still has a ways to go.
The shrinking of manufacturing employment is global. In other words, strategies to restore manufacturing jobs in one country will amount to destroying them in another, in a worldwide zero-sum game.

The loss of such jobs has created plenty of problems in the United States. For the countless workers living in less developed reaches of the world, though, it adds up to a potential disaster.
Japan's long stagnation can be read as a consequence of a decades-long development strategy that left the nation overly dependent on manufacturing. “They are focused on a dead-end business,” said Bruce Greenwald, an expert on investment strategy at Columbia Business School. “They are not eliminating hours of work in manufacturing fast enough to keep pace with the reduction in work needed.”

The richest countries today started deindustrializing when they were already well off and benefited from fairly skilled and productive work forces that could make the transition into well-paid service jobs, as increasingly affluent consumers devoted less of their incomes to physical goods and more to leisure, advanced health care and other services.
Poorer countries have more limited options. If the demise of manufacturing jobs in the United States forced many workers into low-paid retail jobs and the like, imagine the challenge in a country like India, where factory employment has already topped out, yet income per person is only one twenty-fifth of what it was in the United States at its peak.

“Developing countries are suffering premature deindustrialization,” said Dani Rodrik, a leading expert on the international economy who teaches at Harvard's Kennedy School. “Both employment and output deindustrialization is setting in at much lower levels of income.”
This is even happening in a manufacturing behemoth like China — which appears to have maxed out the industrial export strategy at a much lower income level than its successful Asian predecessors, like Japan and Taiwan.
For poorer countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, the decline of manufacturing as a bountiful source of jobs puts an end to the prime path to riches that the modern world has followed.

Manufacturing, Professor Rodrik points out, has unique advantages. For one thing, it can quickly employ lots of unskilled workers. “Setting up a factory to make toys puts you on a productivity escalator in a way that traditional agriculture and services didn't do,” they said.
ADVERTISEMENT
Moreover, production isn't constrained by a small domestic market: Exports of goods can easily flow around the world, allowing industry room to grow and giving developing countries time to ride up the ladder of income, skills and sophistication.
The natural resources that dominate the exports of many poor countries don't have these features. They employ few workers and offer little added value. They do not encourage acquiring skills, and they expose countries to violent swings in commodity prices.
High-end services such as finance and programming do pay well. But these aren't the service sectors most poor countries build. A majority of service jobs in most poor countries are generally limited to housework, mom-and-pop retail and the like. Since these sectors offer little productivity growth and are generally isolated from foreign competition, they cannot pull a nation out of poverty.
The first large transition from agriculture to industry in the early 20th century — well lubricated by public spending on world wars — liberated workers from their chains far more effectively than Karl Marx's revolution ever did.

The current transition, from manufacturing to services, is more problematic. In poor countries, Mr. Rodrik says, workers may have to pare back their aspirations of development. Who knows “how will political systems manage?” they ask.
In the United States, the political challenge is no less daunting. Low pay married to high profits in much of the service economy are contributing to a widening income chasm that is rending society in all sorts of ways. Used to the prosperity once delivered by manufacturing, American workers are rebelling against the changing tide.
Note to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump: A grab at the world's manufacturing jobs is the wrong answer. Walls will damage prosperity, not enhance it. Promises to recapture industrial-era greatness ring hollow.
The United States, though, does have options: health care, education and clean energy, just to name a few. They present big economic and political challenges, of course — not least the enormous inefficiency of private American medicine and Republicans' blanket opposition to more public spending.
Yet just as the federal government once provided a critical push to move the economy from its agricultural past into its industrial future, so, too, could it help build a postindustrial tomorrow.

After growing in size and strength, Lincoln Park Zoo's first-ever Red Panda cubs Clark, a male, and Addison, a female, are now in their outdoor exhibit!

ZooBorns has reported on the cubs' progress in stories here and here. Born June 26, Addison and Clark have spent the last few months behind-the-scenes with their mother, Leafa. The Red Pandas will be on and off exhibit intermittently as they continue to acclimate from their nest box behind-the-scenes.
“We're excited to see the cubs explore their outdoor exhibit space and to be able to share their playful nature with our guests,” said Curator of Mammals Mark Kamhout. “The Red Panda cubs continue to grow in size but also in how vocal they are, their activity level, and curiosity levels.”
Red Pandas are Raccoon-like in appearance and have Panda in their name, but are not related to either species – genetics indicate that Red Pandas belong to a unique family. Red Pandas are native to the Himalayan mountain range and due to habitat loss and poaching, Red Pandas are considered a Vulnerable species.

A San Diego Fire-Rescue team lifts the injured surfer by crane to the surface of the cliff. (Published Saturday, Feb. 18, 2017)
A surfer was rescued from rocks beneath Sunset Cliffs Saturday morning.
San Diego Fire-Rescue (SDFD) received the initial emergency call at 12:13 p.m. and responded to the 1100 block of Sunset Cliffs Boulevard.
Photo credit: NBC 7
The man recovered in the rescue suffered a lower-leg fracture, according to SDFD Lt. Rick Romero.
Ocean Beach resident Steven Farmer came to Sunset Cliffs to check out the waves and saw the surfer fighting to hold their own against the strong surf.
"I got out of my car because I saw them struggling," Farmer said. "He seemed out of breath. They kept looking out to sea then back at the rocks behind him."
Farmer says the surfer was forced into a cove and onto a rocky area by northward currents. They then handed their surfboard up to Farmer and other spectators and attempted to climb up a rock face to the surface of the cliff.
The surfer was unable to negotiate the rock face and fell backwards onto the rocks below, which is when the leg injury occurred.
Sir Alex Ferguson, the Manchester United manager, and their assistant, Mike Phelan, will be at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday night when Poland international Lewandowski is due to play for the German champions against Manchester City in the Champions League Group D tie.
Telegraph Sport has learnt that Dortmund were made aware of United's interest in Lewandowski, 24, in August, prior to Robin van Persie's £22million transfer from Arsenal to Old Trafford, and that the German club rejected the possibility of a deal in the region of €20million (£16million).
Chelsea have also actively scouted the former Lech Poznan forward, who has scored 31 goals in 72 league games for Dortmund and shone for Poland at Euro 2012.
Lewandowski has made it clear to Dortmund, however, that they will not sign an extension to their contract at the club, which expires in June 2014, and there is an acceptance in Germany that they will be sold at the end of this season.
United capitalised on Shinji Kagawa's diminishing contract at Dortmund this summer by striking a £17million deal for the Japanese midfielder, whose deal had entered its final 12 months.
And with Dortmund adopting a business model which prevents them paying excessive wages, cashing in on Lewandowski next summer rather than lose them as a free agent in 2014, is the preferred option.
United have emerged as front-runners to sign the Pole, however, due to the growing doubts over Nani and Hernández.
Nani has yet to agree terms on a new contract at the club and, although there is a willingness on both sides to negotiate a new deal, the Portuguese winger's from this season has done little to accelerate United's attempts to secure their services beyond the end of their contract, which expires in June 2014.
Zenit St Petersburg had been keen to sign the former Sporting Lisbon player in August, but the Russian club were unable to force through a deal prior to the transfer deadline.
And while Hernández signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford last October, the Mexican forward has struggled for form since scoring 20 goals in their debut season at United in 2010-11.
Hernández has subsequently slipped to fourth choice striker, behind Van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck, and another disappointing campaign could trigger their departure from the club.
Although Lewandowski operates as a central striker for Dortmund, they have regularly performed as a wide player in a 4-3-3 formation for Poland and their versatility would enable them to fit into Sir Alex Ferguson's desire for their players to possess the flexibility to perform in more than one role.
After being rested by Dortmund for Saturday's 5-0 Bundesliga victory against Borussia Mönchengladbach, Lewandowski, who scored the only goal of the game in last month's 1-0 Group D victory against Ajax, is expected to be restored to the starting line-up by coach Jürgen Klopp against City.
Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, who went platinum with their album The Heist this year, are slated to go on a hiatus. The duo's manager, Zach Quillen, said that Mack and Lewis are going to “take some time off” following the Grammy Awards in 2014.
“Yeah, we're gonna disappear for a little while,” Quillen said in an interview with xxlmag.com. “This album cycle is coming to a close. We'll, I imagine, go to the Grammys in January this year and afterwards, kind of call it quits for a bit and take some time off.”
The year was a significant one for Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. After releasing their album The Heist in 2012, the duo gained notoriety in 2013 with singles “Thrift Shop,” “Can't Hold Us,” “Same Love” and “White Walls.” The album also surpassed the million copy milestone in sales this year.
Quillen said the duo will begin work on a new album in 2014, but added that they are “in no rush.”
Macklemore & Ryan Lewis have been in various award shows this year, including MTV's Video Music Awards, where the duo performed and won awards, including “Best Hip Hop Video.” The duo also participated in the first-ever YouTube Awards this year. Mack & Lewis are nominated for the upcoming AMAs, as well.
In 2012, Macklemore spoke with HipHopDX about their career and legacy before releasing The Heist.
“I want to be remembered as somebody that put honesty first, that put vulnerability first, that said things they were scared to say, that I was scared to say,” Macklemore said in an exclusive interview with HipHopDX. “And somebody that really put on for the Northwest and put on for Seattle. I think that the music is much bigger than myself, and it comes from a place bigger than myself. And I don't ever want to take credit for that. That is a force beyond me. I think I'm a part of something that is greater. And I want to use that to the best of my ability to write honest, personal and sincere music that has an impact on people.”
After The Heist‘s release, Ryan Lewis spoke with HipHopDX about the project and the process of its creation.
“What was cool about The Heist was that it was a unique process for a lot of reasons,” they said. “We spent three years on it. That in and of itself is unusual, particularly for the Hip Hop genre because people are just cranking out records. We spent a long time on all those songs. It was a record that had so much collaboration involved from the amount of features that were doing hooks and the vocals on there to the variety of instruments…I think spending that much time on a record enabled me to pursue a wide variety of ideas.”

For the first time, the leadership of Russia's judicial system has admitted that courts in the country receive direct pressure from the Kremlin. As the Kommersant newspaper reported on May 13th, such was the testimony given by Yelena Valyavina, the first deputy chair of the Supreme Arbitration Court.
Valyavina testified as a witness in Moscow's Dorogomilovsky court during a libel trial regarding the defense of honor of Valery Boyev, an aide in the administration of former President Vladimir Putin. Boyev has sought the retraction of statements made by journalist and anchor Vladimir Solovyev, who spoke of the Kremlin's interference in the work of Russian courts.
Valyavina described before the court how Boyev contacted them with instructions regarding a high-profile case of the Tolyattiazot joint-stock company. After Valyavina refused to comply, Boyev allegedly threatened that they would be not be reappointed to their post.
Valyavina went on to describe the role Boyev plays in appointing judges: “As a representative of the presidential administration, they sit in on sessions of the Supreme Judges Qualification Board, where they can make public certain information. The speed with which judges are appointed to their positions also depends on him.” Furthermore, Valyavina added that judges may fear losing deserved government decorations if they stand by their principled positions.
Valery Boyev, a personnel and state decorations assistant working in the Kremlin, filed a civil libel suit to defend their honor and dignity in April. They demanded the retraction of assertions made by Vladimir Solovyev during a broadcast on the Severny Dozhd (Northern Rain) radio station, which were also later printed on the treli.ru website. The statements in question are as follows: “That same Boyev, who commands the Supreme Arbitration Court.” “There are no independent courts in Russia. There are only courts, dependent on Boyev.” And finally, “This is what's called Russian justice, which is supervised by… Boyev”
A new session of the court will meet on May 26th. The defense plans to bring three witnesses: the chairperson of the Moscow Oblast Arbitration Court, Yevgeny Ilyin; the chairperson of the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast Arbitration Court, Boris Kanevsky; and the chairperson of the Tenth Arbitration Appeals Court, Artur Absalyamov.
In the meantime, the process continued. Valery Boyev's attorney commented that their client merely prepares documents on the appointment of judges, and cannot show interest in the millions of cases under consideration in Russia's courts.
The defense has asked that Boyev themselves appear in the court, and said that according to their information Boyev serves as a colonel in Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). “If Yelena Valyavina's facts prove true, then this will now be a criminal case, and not a civil one,” Solovyev said.
Experts said this was the first time a highly-ranked official publicly has accused Kremlin staff of pressuring Russia's highest court.
It looks bad for Hillary Clinton—again. This New York Times story alleging that they might have violated federal rules by using a personal email account instead of an official government one for their communications seems to raise all the old questions about Clintonian corner-cutting and is sure to make Democrats flail their arms and cry, “Oh God, this again?”
But let's hold on a second. A close reading of the Times piece reveals one potential big hole in the case. I'm not saying the Times is wrong here. It's still a foggy situation. I am, however, saying this: You have to know how to read these things, and if you do know how to read them, there's a big question here that could—potentially—exonerate Clinton to some or maybe even a considerable extent.
The article says that there were “new” regulations that Clinton was supposed to abide by. It notes that one past secretary of state, Colin Powell, who served from 2001 to 2005, sometimes used their personal email account “before the new regulations went into effect.”
So, a key question would seem to be this: When did the new regulations go into effect? If 2007 or 2008, then Clinton would appear to be in direct violation of them, depending on what precisely they said. If later, it gets a little murkier.
Oddly, the Times article doesn't say. It doesn't pin the new regs down to a specific date or even year.
Now, I know enough about reporting knowing how this works. If you've got an airtight case, then you lay it all out there. You include the date. Indeed you emphasize the date, you put it high up in your story. The fact that it's not in there is a little fishy.
Well, this might be the explanation: The new regs apparently weren't fully implemented by State until a year and half after Clinton left State. Here's the timeline: Clinton left the State Department on February 1, 2013. Back in 2011, President Obama had signed a memorandum directing the update of federal records management. But the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) didn't issue the relevant guidance, declaring that email records of senior government officials are permanent federal records, until August 2013. Then, in September 2013, NARA issued guidance on personal email use.
A senior State Department official emailed me to say that “in October 2014, a Department-wide notice was sent out which explained each employee's responsibilities for records management. Consistent with 2013 NARA guidance, it included instructions that generally employees should not use personal email for the transaction of government business, but that in the very limited circumstances when it is necessary, all records must be forwarded to a government account or otherwise preserved in the Department's electronic records systems.”
So if these new regulations went into effect after they left State, then what rule did they violate, exactly? And, if this is true, why did the Times not share this rather crucial piece of information with its readers? No one could possibly argue that this fact isn't germane to the story. It's absolutely central to it. Why would the Times leave it out?
Here are a few other specifics surrounding this matter that the Times article doesn't make clear. These facts are already making the rounds on the Internet:
1. Clinton was not the first Secretary to use a private email account. In fact, John Kerry is the first Secretary to use “a standard government email address,” according to The Washington Post.
2. Clinton turned over their emails to the State Department. It's not clear whether their predecessors did the same.
3. The Times article says the “existence of Mrs. Clinton's personal email account was discovered by a House committee investigating the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi.” This is incorrect. Gawker reported this first, in March 2013.
4. At the time Clinton was Secretary, the Federal Records Act didn't require federal employees to use government accounts, only to preserve records of their communications. This, Clinton seems to have done.
So what, exactly, did they do wrong here? Maybe something—I'm not saying she's totally in the clear. They and their people still should answer the question: Why no government email address at all? What would have been the good and straightforward reason for not having one? It's a little too early to know exactly what the facts are, and how culpable Clinton is here of any possible wrongdoing. But of course it's not too early for people to read the Times story and start making noise about a “pattern” of Clinton behavior that this falls into.
Maybe. But this seems like a good time to remember another pattern of behavior: namely, that of the Times. I remember clear as a bell reading that initial Jeff Gerth story on Whitewater back in March 1992. It seemed devastating. But on top of it, media and political operators hostile to the Clintons piled all sorts of phony accusations that took millions of dollars and many years to unravel. When it was all over, courts both literal and of public opinion found that the Clintons did nothing wrong on Whitewater -- except to be naïve enough to let themselves be lured into a money-losing venture by Jim McDougal.
If they had done something wrong, with all the prosecutorial firepower thrown at them by a prosecutor (Ken Starr) who clearly hated them, don't you think they'd have been indicted? Of course they would have been. But Starr couldn't turn anything up on Whitewater and was about to close down their investigation empty-handed until they got wind of a gal named Monica.
So that's a pattern too. The Times, for those with short memories, have never loved the Clintons. Remember Howell Raines and their ceaseless, thundering editorials against them. And today, it smells like the Times may have been rolled by the Republican staff of the Benghazi panel. And hey, great work by them and Chairman Trey Gowdy to use the nation's leading liberal newspaper in this way.
Clinton still has some questions to answer, two that I can think of: Why did they not take a state.gov address? And is the Times accurate in writing that “her aides took no actions to have their personal emails preserved on department servers at the time, as required by the Federal Records Act”? If they can't put forward persuasive answers to these two questions, then there may still be something here.
But the Times has some questions to answer to: Did you know that the new regs went into effect after Clinton left office? And if you didn't, why not? And if you did, why did you leave that fact out of the story? One can imagine Clinton coming up with decent answers to their questions, but it's kind of hard to see how the Times can.
UPDATE 3/24/15: This story has been updated to more accurately reflect what was in the original 1992 Times article about Whitewater.
Image copyright Google Image caption The home where four people were shot on 1 October
Last week, a gunman killed nine people at a community college in Oregon. Several hours later, another man shot three in Florida. Only one made international news.
Walter "Buzz" Terhune was a Vietnam veteran who moved to Florida to care for their elderly parents. They loved kids, helping other veterans and participating in civic life in tiny Inglis, a commercial fishing town near Florida's west coast.
Terhune didn't know Otis Ray Bean, but that didn't stop the 68-year-old from coming to Bean's aid when they were shot across the street from where Terhune was getting cash at a bank.
The shooter then turned their weapon on Terhune, then their estranged wife, then himself.
"It was so like them to go to save somebody else," says Lea Terhune, Walter's sister. "Buzz would not run the other way."
Walter Terhune stumbled into what would turn out to be one of two mass killings in the US on 1 October. The first occurred several hours earlier, 3,000 miles away in Roseburg, Oregon, when a 26-year-old man opened fire inside a classroom at Umpqua Community College. They wounded dozens and killed at least nine people before they shot himself.

Like many other Americans, Wendy Harvey was following the news from their home in Steamboat Spring, Colorado, when they got a call from a relative saying their uncle Buzzy had also been involved in a shooting. They were at home with their son at the time.
"It's a hard conversation to tell your six-year-old that their favourite uncle just got shot and killed," they say. "Oregon is going on and all of a sudden you hear from Florida that it's your uncle. It can happen to anyone."
Both incidents would be classified as "active shooter" incidents - defined as "an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people" - and also could both be considered "mass killings", defined by one federal statute as three or more people killed.
But Oregon has overshadowed what happened in Inglis, with no national media attention devoted to the latter. It is in part a matter of timing - Oregon happened first - and a matter of numbers. The Oregon shooting had more than three times as many casualties.
Still, says Harvey, this paints a disturbing portrait of gun violence in the US today.
"It's become such the norm," they say. "That's a sad state of affairs if someone kills three people and it's just not that big of a deal."

According to local news reports in Florida, 57-year-old Walter Tyson went to the unpainted wooden house across from Inglis's city hall to confront their estranged wife Patricia and their new boyfriend, Bean. Tyson was armed. Witnesses said Terhune had tried to stop Tyson by telling them they were shooting close to a park where children were playing.
"He talks to vets a lot that have PTSD and all these things. They feel like they can talk to them and relate to them," says Harvey. "I'm sure in their head they thought they could talk to this person."
According to the FBI, the number of "active shooter" incidents rose in frequency between 2000 and 2013. It reported that there were an average of 16.4 active shooter events each year between 2007 to 2013, compared to an average of 6.4 incidents from 2000 to 2006.
While there is no universally accepted definition of a "mass shooting", using the federal statute that defines it as three or more killed shows that they are also on the rise. (Other measures of incidents of mass violence exclude ones that began as a domestic dispute, or ones where the victims knew one another.)
There have been more "mass shootings" than days of the year so far in 2015.
Including Terhune and the Tysons, three people died in Inglis on Thursday. Bean was taken to a hospital, but according to their sister, Nadene Bean Freeman, they are brain dead and is only on life support so that their organs may be harvested.
They said their brother was recovering from their own personal tragedy - their only son Jared was killed in a car crash as a young boy, then their wife died of cancer.
"He's at peace now," they wrote in a message to the BBC.
While the circumstances might have been different, Terhune's family feels they are going through something similar to the nine families in Roseburg.
"Mass murder is still one family by one family by one family," says their sister Lea. "He came home from war a damaged person...in their death they became the hero that in their heart they always are."

This is known as "fiat" money.Not only that, the dollar is backed by a government thatits citizens to use their currency for commerce and to pay taxes (unless you want to go to jail).Bitcoin is a stateless and non-violent currency.because it is a global currency, not restricted by artificial borders.because people are not forced to use Bitcoin as a currency - it is their choice.When government has the power to print an unlimited amount of money, it also hasPaul Krugman, American economist who doesn't like Bitcoin and winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, illustrated the use of force in our current economy by flatly stating:Bitcoin has a fixed monetary supply where just under 21 million bitcoins will be created.No bank, individual or government can increase the supply of bitcoin under any circumstances.Bitcoin's monetary supply is set in stone (well, set in code).What this means is that Bitcoin, ultimately, is a. As time marches on, holders will be able to purchase more goods for their bitcoins due to their limited supply.In contrast, inflation means you will suffer reduced purchasing power as time goes on, as is the case for the dollar.Deflation is not a foreign concept. The best example is with computing.Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors that can be packed into a computer chip doubles approximately every two years.Put another way, a computer chip's speed doubles every 2 years for the same manufacturing cost.We can also say thatof the same speedComputer chip manufacturing has a deflationary cost basis. Essentially, we get more power for the same cost over time.Bitcoin is also deflationary in the sense that we can purchase more goods for the same cost over time if Bitcoin's price increases due to the effects of supply and demand.Bitcoin's price is derived purely from free market dynamics. That means, bitcoin's price is the result of changing supply and demand levels in the market.If more people want bitcoin, the price goes up. If fewer people want bitcoin, the price goes down.Many people believe Bitcoin would create a fairer economy, as opposed to an economy manipulated in secret by men perched on top of their golden thrones.A core component of the Bitcoin network are the single-purpose computers that order, verify and package transactions, known as "miners".The incentive structure built into the Bitcoin Core code ensures that miners are paid (in bitcoin) for the work they perform.These miners (tens of thousands of them) are the backbone of the Bitcoin network. The hardware alone amounts toof investment into the infrastructure of Bitcoin.The computational speed of the Bitcoin network is far greater than all of the world's supercomputers - combined!There is tremendous value in the infrastructure of the Bitcoin network.The greater number of people using Bitcoin increases the value of Bitcoin itself.This is known as theFor example, the more people who own telephones, the more valuable the telephone becomes to each owner. This creates a "positive externality" because a user may purchase a telephone without intending to create value for other users, but does so in any case.Online social networks work in the same way, with sites like Twitter and Facebook becoming more useful as more users join.That's why buying bitcoin makesvaluable and strengthens Bitcoin's value for everyone else as well.
Though he's not in the business of throwing money away, local developer John Pollard said their interest in restoring a pair of heritage buildings on south Main Street is for “largely altruistic reasons.”
The co-CEO of Pollard Banknote has taken ownership of the Fortune Block on the southwest corner of Main Street and St. Mary Avenue, and is confident negotiations for the neighbouring MacDonald Block will ultimately be successful.
The pair, along with the nearby Winnipeg Hotel, were declared heritage buildings by city council on Jan. 27, protecting them from demolition and effectively scuttling a private proposal to buy the three buildings and demolish them in favour of a $35-million hotel project.
Pollard didn't reveal the purchase price, but has said it will cost millions to restore the buildings to their former glory.
“It'd be very difficult to get a proper return on that, but I'm going to enjoy doing it,” they said. “Our city deserves better-looking buildings there. It's a historic piece of downtown Winnipeg it'd be a shame to lose.”
The Fortune Block was built in 1882 by real-estate developer Mark Fortune, but sold before it opened to wholesale grocer Alexander MacDonald, who built a similar building south of it the next year. Fortune died in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912.
Wayne Towns owns the MacDonald Block as well as the Winnipeg Hotel, which dates back to 1873, and the vacant lot between them where the Blue Note Cafe once stood.
Pollard Banknote's roots trace back to 1907 as a commercial printer. It's now one of the world's largest producers of instant games like scratch-and-win and break-open tickets with annual sales in excess of $50 million.
Plans for the Fortune Block include an expansion of roots and blues music venue, the Times Change(d) High & Lonesome Club, another street-level retail opportunity and the conversion of the upper floors, which have been vacant more than 40 years, to office space. Plans for the MacDonald Block are more of an open slate, but if Pollard is unable to secure its purchase, the opportunity for a “more fulsome, completely restored and renovated” space goes out the window.
“The buildings are frankly in terrible condition. They've been allowed to rundown very badly. There's a huge amount of work to be done on them, and it'll be very expensive,” Pollard said. “It would give us pause about spending millions on the Fortune Block if it's forever beside a rooming house.”
Area councillor Jenny Gerbasi said having a private developer tackle the project is a “very positive thing for this area of the downtown and the city as a whole.”
“Many cities are losing heritage buildings but also unique, character music venues . . . at quite a rapid rate. These places add so much character and it is great news that Times Changed is being saved,” they said via email.
Pollard had been looking for a downtown or Exchange area renovation project and, as fate would have it, hooked up with Times Change(d) owner John Scoles, who married the sister of their brother's wife. Pollard said he'd likely never become a regular, but appreciates its role in the area.
“It's a great kind of business for downtown Winnipeg. It brings people downtown, there's a local owner-operator of an iconic club that's been there for (almost) 30 years, and it's a performing venue for local, emerging musicians which is important to have. We need more of those.”
The Times it is a changin'
After years of an uncertain future hinged to its locale in the historic Fortune Block, the beloved honkytonk had its future cemented with the purchase of the building by local business person John Pollard.
John Scoles, who has owned Times Change(d) High & Lonesome Club for better than half of its nearly 30-year history, said they feel blessed.
“Everything works out here, no matter what it is, no matter what the circumstance,” they said during an interview in the basement of the 134-year-old building Saturday night. “In fact, however good you thought it would work out, it's actually even better.”
The quirky 85-seat club has helped boost the careers of many locals, and is a favourite drop-in for numerous touring artists. It recently made a Buzzfeed list of iconic music venues for Canadians to experience.
Renovations are expected to be completed by the end of September. The plan is to double the seating capacity and add what amounts to a chill zone — the Hideaway Lounge — in the back where a sign company had been. And there'll be heat, a sticking point for many winter visitors and part of the reason for a rack of housecoats on the wall.
Scoles said a two-foot cement wall between their club and retail space next door prevents a greater redesign, which they are resistant to anyway, guided by the notion that if there's one thing they can't lose, it's that feel.
“We don't need more people to make this work,” they said, noting they often turn away 30 to 40 people on a weekend night. “We just need to take better care of the people that want to be here in the first place. It's just done what we do, only better.”
Scoles said they often considered buying the building himself, but couldn't find a way to manage the risk. He's pleased that the community helped culture win out over condos, and that they can remain in a building they feel tied to, working under a good friend in Pollard, who they met through theirs marriage.
“You need that level of resource to come and be interested and open to the possibility of it, and yeah, without him, this next chapter wouldn't be possible. There'd be a chapter, but not this.”

An alleged assassin has been arrested amid claims they advertised themselves as a contract killer on Facebook.
Jonathan Giraldo is said to use the alias Tony Garcia and given themselves the nickname Anthrax - after the killer disease in an attempt to evade capture.
However, police swooped on the 38-year-old after they reportedly posted genuine photographs and videos of themselves posing with weapons and wads of cash.
(Image: Facebook)
In the 'professional background' section of the profile, where Giraldo is accused of calling themselves Most Wanted, it said: "On the streets - you learn more than in school."
When police stormed their apartment in Miraflores, an area of Lima, Peru, they claim to have found them updating their profile with further claims of criminal escapades.
They were arrested on suspicion of firearms offences and is being held in custody.
Officers said it was unclear whether they were a fantasist or a genuine hitman.

Police spokesperson Leonidas Menendez said: "The truth of it is at the moment we do not know yet if they really are a contract killer or if they are an idiot making up a fantasy life from their bedroom, but we will find out the truth.
"We are currently doing ballistics checks on the weapons and looking at their bank accounts to see if there have been any suspicious payments."
Last week, we told how police arrested suspected hitmen in Colombia amid claims they gunned down four children after being paid to kill their parents.

Group Shouted Anti-Gay Slurs at Woman in Manhattan Restaurant, Threw Them to Ground: NYPD
The NYPD is investigating an attack on a woman dinning at a Manhattan restaurant as a bias case.
Police say the woman was having dinner with their mother at an outdoor cafe Saturday in the Barkogi restaurant in midtown when two women and a man sitting behind them started yelling obscenities and gay slurs.
The suspects then allegedly threw the woman to the ground and dragged them by the legs before fleeing.
The victim had cuts and bruises to their knees and was treated at a hospital.
Police say neither woman knew the attackers.
The NYPD's hate crime task force is investigating.
Anyone with information about the attackers is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS.

Both before and after a shady, Kremlin-tied lawyer met with Donald Trump Jr. and other Trump campaign officials in June 2016, they consulted with a top official of Fusion GPS, the firm now known to have been commissioned by the Clinton campaign to produce the infamous Trump dossier.
A report by Fox News suggests there may thus have been coordination regarding the dossier between the Fusion principal, Glenn Simpson, and the Russian attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya. That possibility cannot be discounted. After all, we don't know what their discussions entailed, even though Simpson has met behind closed doors with congressional investigators.
But there's a more plausible explanation. Their consultations were almost surely dominated by — if perhaps not exclusively taken up with — the civil forfeiture federal prosecutors were then pursuing against Prevezon Holdings, a Kremlin-crony company for which both Fusion and Veselnitskaya were working. To understand why, recall what was going on in the case at the time.
There has been a great deal of news in recent weeks about Perkins Coie, the law firm that represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and that retained Fusion — which, in turn, hired former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the dossier. Less attention has been paid to Baker Hostetler, the law firm that represented Prevezon, and that retained Fusion to do research in connection with the forfeiture case.
Prevezon is controlled by the Katsyv family — specifically Denis Katsyv, the son of Pyotr Katsyv, a high-ranking Russian transportation official and close confederate of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. Veselnitskaya is a lawyer for the Katsyvs in Moscow, a big part of what makes them a trusted Kremlin operative.
Prevezon was one of the companies allegedly involved in the swindle of hundreds of millions of dollars from the Russian financial fund Hermitage. This is the spectacular fraud that was uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, a private investigator in Moscow. Upon exposing the Putin regime's culpability, they were imprisoned, tortured and killed. This atrocity drove Congress to enact the 2012 Magnitsky Act.
It was this legislation that enabled federal prosecutors in Manhattan to seek to forfeit up to $230 million in fraud proceeds from Prevezon. In conjunction with advocating for Prevezon, lobbying the US government to repeal the Magnitsky Act has been Veselnitskaya's main work in America. It's a major Putin priority.
Veselnitskaya is not admitted to practice law in the United States. Obviously, Prevezon needed American lawyers. The company, in consultation with Veselnitskaya, retained Baker Hostetler.
This was extremely controversial: Baker Hostetler had done extensive work for Hermitage, specifically in connection with the fraud that, according to federal prosecutors, Prevezon benefited from. This created an unseemly conflict of interest: It is unethical for lawyers who have represented a fraud victim subsequently to take on the representation of an alleged conspirator in the fraud scheme.
So what was going on in June 2016?
Hermitage had sought to disqualify Baker Hostetler from representing Prevezon. Strangely, a federal district judge denied the motion. Thus, on June 9 — the same day Veselnitskaya met with Trump campaign officials at Trump Tower in Midtown — the Second Circuit US Court of Appeals in lower Manhattan heard arguments in Hermitage's appeal of the denial of the disqualification motion.
Plainly, this was a matter of immense importance to both Fusion and Veselnitskaya. Again, Fusion had been hired by Baker Hostetler; if the law firm were removed from the case, Fusion's further participation would be in doubt. Moreover, the disqualification of Baker Hostetler would leave Veselnitskaya scrambling to find new counsel for Prevezon with potentially tens of millions of dollars hanging in the balance.
This isn't to minimize the significance of the dossier, but to observe that Veselnitskaya and Fusion's Simpson had more pressing business at that time. A more curious question is why the Obama administration issued a visa allowing Veselnitskaya to come to the United States at that point.
In any event, Prevezon settled the case with the Justice Department in May 2017, sparing the Putin regime a public airing of the fraud scheme and Magnitsky's murder. By then, the Second Circuit, in October 2016, had reversed the lower court and disqualified Baker Hostetler.
The law firm had been caught playing both sides, much like its Fusion GPS contractor appears to have played for both the Clinton campaign and the Kremlin.

AZ Starnet Fox News has obtained a Department of Homeland Security memo that has compiled information suggesting alleged Arizona shooter Jared Loughner may have ties to American Renaissance, a pro-white racist organization that publishes an anti-immigration newsletter.
No direct connection, but strong suspicion is being directed at American Renaissance, an organization that Loughner mentioned in some of their internet postings and federal law enforcement officials are investigating Loughner's possible links to the organization. The organization is a monthly publication that promotes a variety of white racial positions.
"The group's ideology is anti government, anti immigration, anti ZOG (Zionist Occupational Government), anti Semitic," according to the memo which goes on to point out that Congressman Giffords is the first Jewish female elected to high office in Arizona. A recent posting on American Renaissance's website on January 7 begins with an article entitled: "Exit poll: Whites are Different." The site goes on to list anti-immigration articles. Investigators are also pursuing Loughner's alleged anti-Semitism.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has taken command of the investigation.
According to the memo, Federal Judge John Roll's wife told law enforcement that they were not supposed to be at the rally but was called an hour beforehand and decided to attend at the last minute. Roll reportedly ruled on a controversial 32 million dollar civil rights lawsuit in February 2010 that elicited death threats for them and their family resulting in added security detail being assigned to them as a result.
About This Game Ghostship Aftermath - the game that takes SCI-FI SURVIVAL HORROR to a new level. Prepare for a new breed of survival horror with rogue-like elements!
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Over 350 years in the future humankind has embraced space travel and exploration. We have colonized many worlds and spread ourselves across the galaxy. The Colonial Defense Force (CDF) is responsible for the security of Earth and their colonies, and our only line of defense against the unknown.
On March 1st 2368 contact was lost with our most distant colony, located in the Icarus System. The Dreadnought class spaceship CDF Goliath was dispatched on March 3rd 2368 to investigate. The CDF lost contact with the Goliath not long after it entered the Icarus System on March 12th 2368.  They are now presumed a Ghostship!
Before sending any more CDF forces it is common practice to send in an Advance Scientific Evaluation Team (ASET) comprised of 2 specialists from the Colonial Science Division (CSD) to determine if there are any biological or scientific threats which would impede a salvage operation.
You play the part of Dr. Jake Abbots who boards the CDF Goliath while your partner, Dr. David Riggs, stays behind on the CSD Alexis as mission control. You have radio contact with Dr. Riggs and they will give you objectives, advice, and help you along the way. Or at least that was the plan. As you will soon find out, anything can happen aboard the Ghostship...
Your actions will decide your fate in this non-linear sci-fi survival horror game with real consequences. You have limited oxygen and sprinting uses it 4x as fast, while your helmet has a non-rechargeable, non-replaceable 1-hour flashlight battery. So manage them well to avoid suffocation, or dying to unseen horrors lurking in the dark. After all, dead is dead. With permadeath there are no do-overs, when you die you have to start a new game, but with random events and multiple story-line branches death is just a new beginning, and every game will offer something new!

Something interesting happened following Metro's single-tracking and long-term shutdowns.
Lyft started offering discounted rides to Washington commuters. With these discounts, the ride sharing giant joins FedEx, Underwriters Laboratories, private schools, passport expeditors, and many other businesses to become one more private-sector company offering to fix the blunders of a public-sector enterprise. According to market skeptics, this isn't the way it's supposed to work – Lyft is a profit-seeking entity. And according to conventional wisdom, profit-seeking companies jump at opportunities to exploit in pursuit of the almighty dollar. With Metro on the ropes and thousands of commuters stranded, conditions are perfect for services like Lyft to charge the absolute maximum the market will bear. Why then are they cutting their price in half?
ADVERTISEMENT
It turns out that market skeptics are partly right.
Private companies don't drive prices down and quality up. Just look at Comcast, whose prices only go up while every other price in the tech world keeps going down. According to its own customers, Comcast's customer service rivals that of the DMV. The private sector doesn't bestow a magical ability to deliver high quality at low prices. Market proponents and skeptics alike know that Comcast is more like the DMV than Netflix because Comcast faces little competition. Yet neither does competition bestow a magical ability to deliver high quality at low prices.
Metro is but one example. Metro faces all sorts of competition from walking to bikes to private cars to carpools to taxis, Uber, and Lyft. Yet Metro's service has become so poor as to become – quite literally – non-existent. It turns out that the magic formula is the combination of competition and private enterprise.
Corporations do seek the almighty dollar, but market skeptics go off the rails when they conclude that the correct response is to replace private sector profit-seekers with government. The quest for this almighty dollar is a powerful drive that can be harnessed for good – provided it is complimented by competition. In a competitive environment, the way profit-seeking companies make money is by providing what consumers want at the lowest possible price. This is why Lyft is dropping its prices 50 percent as Metro cuts service. Lyft is a profit-seeking company that faces stiff competition. By cutting its price, Lyft hopes to encourage Metro's customers to try Lyft. And if those people judge that Lyft delivers a price and quality that Metro can't, they'll stay with Lyft even after the metros stop catching fire.
The private sector is composed of sometimes selfish, sometimes altruistic, sometimes brilliant, always fallible humans – the same that comprise the public sector. Lyft might be run by heartless people who care only about making money. Or, Lyft might be run by principled people who care about providing a fair service at a fair price.
As with the public sector, the reality is likely somewhere in the middle. The folly in replacing private business with government enterprise is that the public sector only achieves the common good when, by happy accident, it is mostly composed of altruistic people. The beauty of a competitive free market is that it doesn't matter whether the people comprising the private sector are altruistic or selfish. Regardless of their motivations, competition forces Lyft's people to behave as if they care about providing a fair service at a fair price. Because the moment they stop, their customers will move on to Lyft's competitors.
Competition has gotten us halfway to solving the problem that is Metro. We'll get the rest of the way when we privatize it. Until we get that combination of competition and private enterprise, Metro will continue to fail.

A favourite of the motor racing purist; a winner of seven Grands Prix, one Champ Car title and is now a two-time Indy 500 winner. My first profile is on Juan Pablo Montoya, a driver whose talent in Formula 1 was never fully recognised as it was across the Atlantic. Here is the Juan Pablo Montoya biography.
Montoya's beginnings in Formula 1 was with Williams in a testing capacity whilst competing in International Formula 3000, a series they won in 1998, beating another future F1 driver in Nick Heidfeld. As part of a swap agreement between Frank Williams and Champ Car team owner Chip Ganassi, Montoya entered the 1999 CART series with Ganassi racing with Ganassi's 97 and 98 CART champion Alessandro Zanardi moving back to Formula 1. The Italian failed to score a point in a miserable return to F1 whilst Montoya became the first rookie CART champion since Nigel Mansell seven years previously. After a season of such success, Montoya decided to stay put for another season, despite Zanardi leaving Williams at the end of 99 to return to America. The 2000 season brought reliability issues which left them unable to retain their title, but they agreed to race full-time with Williams alongside Ralf Schumacher in 2001.
After a steady start in the opening two races, Montoya's talent was fully recognised in Brazil. Under safety car conditions in second place, Montoya made full use of their experience with rolling starts to overtake Michael Schumacher at turn one. A maiden F1 win looked on the cards until a collision with the lapped Jos Verstappen, taking them out of the race, but in 38 laps, Montoya's reputation as a hard racer with raw speed in Formula 1 was assured. Their first podium was achieved with a second place in Spain two races later. After mistakes of inexperience causing retirements in Monaco and Canada, they finished an impressive second in the European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring. At the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Montoya used all of their Williams's powerful BMW engine to secure their first pole position, but retired with engine failure. Their maiden win came at Monza with an assured drive, capitalising on poor pit work by Ferrari, costing Rubens Barrichello the race in front of the Tifosi.
After a learning curve successfully rounded, 2002 brought more exciting driving from Montoya, although it was a season that yielded no wins. They claimed seven pole positions, five of which came consecutively, but Ralf Schumacher brought Williams their one and only win of 2002 in Malaysia, with the team struggling to match the race pace of Ferrari, who ran out comfortable champions.
With significant rule changes made to make F1 closer, Montoya finally had a realistic shot at the World Championship. However, it would be a season of rued opportunities and bad luck costing them dearly. After spinning in the lead in Australia with only a handful of laps remaining – handing victory to David Coulthard – their next best chance of a win came in Austria. They took the lead after Schumacher's Ferrari briefly caught fire during a routine pit-stop, but their BMW engine expired soon after. At the next race in Monaco, Montoya's title challenge was kick-started after showing maturity and skill to hold of Raikkonen and Schumacher to win the race, leaving the championship wide open. After a third and three consecutive second place finishes, Montoya kept their title challenge going with a commanding victory at Hockenheim, in front of Schumacher's fans. However, their title challenge came to an end at the penultimate race in America after a disappointing sixth place finish, caused by receiving a penalty after a collision with Barrichello.
After a close 2003, it was a case of normal serving resuming in 2004, with Ferrari running out comfortable champions again, with Montoya's only win coming at the final round in Brazil. It would prove to be their last race for Williams, having signed for McLaren for 2005 earlier in the season, leaving relations strained with the Williams team throughout the latter half of the season. It would prove to be a frustrating time, often complaining of how the McLaren handled, and even missing two races through injury, whilst at the same time, team-mate Raikkonen finished second in the championship after mounting a competitive challenge against eventual champion, Fernando Alonso. There were moments to savour, however, with three impressive wins at Silverstone, Monza and Interlagos.
2006 started badly for Montoya with the discovery that McLaren had signed Alonso for the 2007 season and decided not to take up the option to keep Montoya for another season. The car was less competitive than the previous season due to problems with engine mapping, as well as continued underperforming from Montoya himself. With a lack of options elsewhere, Montoya announced they were to race in NASCAR in 2007, reuniting with Chip Ganassi. They were offered a quick get-out deal of their contract by McLaren, provided they resigned from receiving any pay-out from it. They decided not to continue until the end of the season, in which they finished eighth in the Championship standings.
After seven seasons in NASCAR, during which they became the first and so far only driver to be part of 24 Hours of Daytona winner three times, Montoya decided to return to IndyCar for 2014 with Penske. After an impressive fourth place in the overall 2014 standings, Montoya, at the time of writing, leads the 2015 series with a second Indy 500 win in the bag, their first victory at the brickyard since 2000. At the age of 39, they are something of a senior figure in American motorsport, but it seems there is still life in the old dog yet.
Montoya's reputation in Formula 1 was that of the fearless and determined racer, unfazed by anyone regardless of reputation, which generally was justified, but it could be said their apparent raison d'etre to defeat Michael Schumacher on several occasions proved to be their downfall, particularly during the 2002 season.
The first of many incidents with Schumacher came at the Austrian Grand Prix in 2001. With Schumacher giving chase to the Colombian, they attempted to overtake them on the outside at turn two. Montoya locked their wheels, sending them and Schumacher wide and off the circuit. The two were not involved in any other major incident – overtaking duels aside – until the second round of 2002 in Malaysia. At the start, Montoya attempted to overtake Schumacher on the outside at turn one. Schumacher pushed Montoya wide, with the Ferrari's front wing being taken off in the process, sending Montoya off the circuit. To add insult to injury, Montoya was judged to have been the perpetrator of the collision, and became the recipient of Formula 1's first drive through penalty. At the next round in Brazil, Montoya started on pole, but a bad start let in Schumacher, who led at the exit of turn one. On the run down to turn four, Montoya got in Schumacher's slipstream, but Schumacher, defending their position, braked with an overzealous Montoya right behind him, and this time it was Williams's front wing that came off. No action was taken by the flight attendants but Montoya was left at the back, complaining to their mechanics about Schumacher's actions, much to their exasperation. Another notable incident came at the European Grand Prix in 2003, when Montoya battled with Schumacher for second position. At the Dunlop Kurve, Montoya overtook Schumacher from the outside, sending Schumacher into as spin as their front wheels touched the kerb. After the race, Schumacher thought there was no problem with the manoeuvre, but Ferrari's technical director Ross Brawn did not agree and labelled Montoya as “not a classy driver”.
While it would be totally fair to contribute Montoya's lack of overall success down to never having the car to win consistently, I believe it would be fair to say that they did not possess all the key attributes that most champions are blessed with such as the tactical capabilities of drivers like Schumacher and Alonso, as well as a calm demeanour behind the wheel, letting their fiery temperament get the better of them on a number of occasions. Despite these points, it would be churlish to suggest Montoya was not a good driver. On their day they could mix it alongside the very best and more successful than a number of drivers who have attempted careers in Formula 1 after racing in America. I think today's Formula 1 would be a damn sight more exciting with drivers like them around.

Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan joined dozens of NFL football players in a silent demonstration during the national anthem on Sunday.
Khan, who donated $1 million to President Donald Trump's inauguration committee, linked arms with players Marcedes Lewis and Telvin Smith at Wembley Stadium in London as an estimated 27 others took a knee on the field.
The stance came in response to Trump saying the NFL should fire players who, in protest of social injustices, kneel during the playing of the national anthem. They also encouraged fans to boycott the league over the protests.
“Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, you'd say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He's fired,'” Trump said during a rally on Friday in Alabama.
They echoed that sentiment on Twitter on Saturday and again on Sunday.
If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017
Baltimore Ravens linebacker C.J. Mosley, wide receiver Mike Wallace and safety Lardarius Webb were among those defying the president by taking a knee on the field on Sunday in London, The Associated Press reported.
Participating Jaguars players included linebacker Dante Fowler, defensive tackle Calais Campbell, defensive end Yannick Ngakoue and cornerback Jalen Ramsey.
In a statement, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti voiced support for the athletes' decision to demonstrate, calling it “democracy in its highest form.”

Pittsburgh Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin, whose team plays the Chicago Bears on Sunday in Chicago, announced that their players will not take the field during the national anthem.
“We're not going to play politics,” they told CBS News.

“We're football players, we're football coaches. We're not participating in the anthem today. Not to be disrespectful to the anthem, but to remove ourselves from this circumstance,” they said. “People shouldn't have to choose. If a guy wants to go about their normal business and participate in the anthem, they shouldn't have to be forced to choose sides. If a guy feels the need to do something, they shouldn't be separated from their teammate who chooses not to. So we're not participating today.”
At game time, almost all of the Steelers declined to come out for the anthem.
Offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva, an Army veteran, broke with the team to stand at the tunnel entrance to the field for the national anthem. When the Steelers emerged, many in the Chicago crowd booed them. Many of the Bears' players linked arms as the anthem played.
Los Angeles Rams owner Stanley Kroenke expressed support of their players' “freedom to peacefully express themselves” in a statement posted to Twitter on Sunday.

Yes, I used to smoke. I quit.
A whole 365 days ago.
What they call “cold turkey”. It was a struggle.
The first three months were insane. Doubt grew each day. Every day. When I woke in the morning, there was a feeling of dread – because it was a new day, it was another 24 hours of excruciating patience and sickening hope that I wouldn't fail.
And this was not the first time I had tried to quit. But it was the last and there was no “try”. I quit.
Some background. I grew up in a household where one parent was a smoker. There used to be regular arguments between both the parents. One wanting the other to quit and the other refusing with childish excuses. I'd always seen cigarette packets at home. There was no smoking inside the house but lots of it outside.
I recall being in 9th Standard and telling my class teacher that I smoked.
I lied because I thought the teacher would report home and everyone's smoking would stop. Nothing of that sort happened of course. And the smoking continued. I used to hate it. The smell. The after-smell. The arguments. The fights.
My first experience with a cigarette was when I was in first year college. I was about 17 years old. No one was home except me. I picked up the cigarette packet – that wasn't hidden very well – gingerly took out a stick, proceeded to the first-floor open-air balcony – it was night time – and lit it. The first drag was followed by a coughing fit and I immediately threw the lit stick to the ground below. I wanted to make sure smoking was indeed terrible and that I wasn't missing out on anything. And I did.
Till I met the first husband. I was 23-24 years old. We worked together at the same office in Bombay. The smoking started as a casual “at a party” thing with a drag or two only. By the time we were married, it had progressed to about a stick or two a day. It was undeniably a habit.
Two years later, we got a divorce and left each other but the cigarette refused to leave me. My average was still about 3-4 sticks a day, not more. And I had convinced myself that I loved the smell of cigarettes.
The people I used to smoke with were acquaintances and friends and strangers. My family had no clue. I was ashamed that I had succumbed to smoking when I used to be the one who used to chastise classmates and friends and colleagues about the exact same thing.
The divorce wasn't extraordinary. It was as traumatic as a break-up between a boy and a girl. Except in this case, there was paperwork. And everyone around me seemed to be more upset than I was. It got to me. I smoked more and usually drank with it. I also started smoking when I was alone in my apartment. I would sit on my couch, in front of the laptop, fire up a film and watch. The cigarettes and alcohol gave company.
I didn't want to purchase ashtrays because I believed that if I ever did, smoking would never leave me. And I did want to quit. I tried. I would not smoke for days. Then weeks and once I even quit for three whole months. But it always came back and I felt worse and worse till the point that the thought of wanting to quit smoking would trigger a need to smoke right there and then.
Then I moved from Bombay to Gurgaon to live with my folks ( 2008 ). I hid in the loo and started up the exhaust fan in the middle of the night so I could smoke. I would go to Galleria ( a marketplace in Gurgaon ) to get my once-in-two-days-fix of coffee and smoke. The cigarette-stall chap knew my name and sold me cigarettes.
My average was still about 2-3 sticks in 2-3 days but I was still smoking. And when I “partied” with friends and acquaintances, there was more smoking. Sometimes countless sticks were smoked before the party ended. My mouth felt like an ash-dump but it was still not enough to make me quit.
B and I met after many years and we got along so well that we decided to get married.
They knew I smoked and one of the conditions of us getting married was that I would have to quit smoking. Right. How the fuck was I going to do that? Especially when no one I knew was in a position to help me. And I did need help.
I told B and myself that I would quit. And I stayed off it for a while – I forget how long. But I fell right back into the hole. I used to go out with friends and make some excuse or another why B couldn't join us and then proceed to smoke. No one told them because I'd made it clear that they didn't need to know. I just couldn't stop. I dreaded going to Galleria because that would definitely mean that I would smoke. I even sprayed perfume straight into my mouth on my way back home right after a smoke.
I had started hiding packets of cigarettes at home. Under my clothes. In my camera bag. But I never bought a lighter. I used matchsticks – because easier to feign an excuse if caught with matches – not so much with a lighter. I love candles and I thought they would be a good excuse if I was EVER caught.
A couple of times I even blamed the neighbors. Their balcony is adjacent to ours and the old gentleman next door, sometimes, smokes when their spouse is not home. And sometimes the cigarette smoke had wafted into our living room in the past.
I used to smoke when B went to the gym. I would fix myself a cold coffee, get out onto the balcony – only far enough so that no one downstairs could see me – and smoke. I would throw the stub off the balcony. Sometimes I'd smoke two sticks. But my life was consumed with how to hide it from B. I did not want my second marriage to end before we'd both given it a good shot.
By now I was brazen enough to even let slip to my folks that I used to smoke “occasionally”. My smoker parent – yes, still smoking – was horrified. I was told how I shouldn't be doing it and I looked at them with a raised eyebrow and said “Really now.” It had all come full circle finally.
I smoked in Canada. I smoked in Bhutan. I smoked in Europe. The people I traveled with had no clue. I was good at hiding it.
I was smoking maybe 2-3 sticks per week but I was still smoking. And it would get out of hand when there was alcohol around. I took breaks between my shoots because I had to go smoke. ( It's only in retrospect, now, I see how much time I was spending either actually smoking or strategizing how not to get caught. The only person who knew how much trouble I was in was my sister. And they tried to help with whatever they could muster. Never anger or chastisement and I am grateful for that. I was already quite full of guilt I'd produced on my own. )
By the third year of my second marriage ( 2012 ), I had finally reconciled to that fact that I wanted to quit smoking. Not because B wanted me to, not because anyone else wanted me, not because it was a “pre-condition” to something, but because I WANTED TO. For me. ( It's possible that one of the reasons I didn't quit sooner was because I was told it was a pre-condition and my brain went “Yeah. Fuck that. I'll do whatever I want.” But then I had to go through that to reach a point where it was just for me. )
I even shared a smoke with my smoker parent. Just that once. I told my parent that my spouse didn't know I smoked and that it should stay that way. They couldn't say anything because it was the same for them.
I confided in a close friend – who doesn't smoke and is older than I am – that I wanted to quit. They said she'd help me. Electronic cigarettes, distractions, whatever. They said she'd be there for me when I had the urge to smoke and that they would distract me and the urge would pass and I could just add up the days slowly. In my head, I was certain it wouldn't work but I was desperate. I'd seen what it did to my parent and I did not want to get there. In fact, both my parent and I decided to quit together. It was a scene straight out of the movies. Me hugging them on a hospital bed, both teary eyed. Promising each other, “No more smoking”.
I was shooting in Jodhpur in December 2012 and I was smoking. In the hotel room, during shoot breaks, after the shoots. Everywhere. B wasn't with me. Family and friends weren't with me. I was in the middle of a crowd of strangers and acquaintances and clients. I could do as I pleased. And I didn't want to smoke. Whenever I had the urge, I would text my friend – Twitter DMs, international SMSes and even calls, whatever was convenient. I would succeed sometimes but other times the opportunities to smoke were coming faster than my urges. And I slipped. And they told me it was ok. That it was better than yesterday. That I was making progress.
That an 85 year old gentleman could quit cold turkey after being a chain smoker for 40 years, was hope enough for me. If they could do it, so could I. My friend kept me sane.
My parent on the other hand, slipped. Instead of how I'd reacted in the past, this time, I treated them like my friend was treating me. Gently, with respect, no chastisement, with encouragement. I had realized that the only way I could quit was if I truly wanted to. I told this to my parent. I told them to let go of the years of arguments and chastisement they had faced from family, to forget about illness and addiction and to do it because they wanted to – for their own self. For no one else. I also kept sharing my progress with them.
In March 2013, I had been squeaky clean for three months straight. Those had been three VERY miserable months. I stopped partying, I stopped hanging out with anyone who smoked. Friends and acquaintances would call me up on my phone and I wouldn't take calls. I would bump into them in marketplaces and on streets and always turn down the offer to hang out / drink / party / have a conversation / coffee / anything and everything.
In March, I told B I had been smoking behind their back. I had to. I don't lie and this had been the only one thing they didn't know about and it was making me sick. To say that they felt betrayed is an understatement. But when I countered with having no help from him, there wasn't much else to discuss. It was what it was and now I was done smoking. I told them it had been three months and if I did need any help, they better stand up to it and help me. They agreed.
I don't recall any withdrawal symptoms. I just craved for a smoke. A drag even. I would stare at discarded cigarette butts on the streets and obsess about how I could squeeze a drag out of them. All I could see were smokers. Calling out to me, like beacons. It's not easy – quitting smoking. And it's a daily process. And I needed help. I took whatever help I got.
Then there was a phase where I forgot to count how many days / weeks / months it had been since I'd quit. I took that as a good sign. I'd racked up 6 months of squeaky clean just like that. My parent had racked up about 4. I started going out little by little – still preferably with people who didn't smoke and I ALWAYS took B with me. I dragged them along everywhere. I no longer needed to text my friend who started me off on the quitting process but I sometimes updated them with how I couldn't believe I'd actually quit and how long it had been. If a particularly strong urge to smoke hit – usually when there was a glass of alcohol in my hand and smoker nearby – I would just walk away.
It then came to a point where I was no longer afraid to be in the company of smokers. I wasn't attracted anymore. I didn't crave it. I still preferred to stay away from passive smoke but that was my only reason for not standing with smokers while they smoked their sticks.
The electronic cigarettes are still lying sealed in my drawer. I didn't need them. Neither did my parent.
The fear of quitting and failing is what kept me away from quitting for so long. After almost a decade of keeping the stick company, I'm now successfully and permanently divorced from it.
31st December 2013 completed a whole year for me without smoking anything – no cigarettes, no cigars, no hookah, no sheesha, nothing. Clean chit. I'm done. And I'm so full of myself with pride. And so grateful to my friend who made me believe that quitting was possible.
If you're thinking of quitting, I hope you will atleast try. Keep trying. And ask for help. It is possible even though you might strongly believe otherwise, like I did. If I had quit because someone else had wanted me to, I would still be smoking because then everything would be about my ego – a little disagreement with that person and smoking would be a way of getting back at them without them knowing. And that's a miserable way to live. Like most species, I like my peace of mind.
I'm happy to answer any questions anyone might have in the comments section below. You can post anonymously – your email will not be visible to anyone except me.
P.S. ( Talking about smoking or quitting, in public, is easier when I've now quit. I don't smoke and I don't support smoking but I will shoot it if it's an assignment. My “showing” smoking doesn't mean anyone has to smoke. Subject for a whole different blog post. )
P.P.S. ( To the “friends of B” who “reported” to them how I was smoking behind their back, if I ever see you in person again, I will pretend like you don't exist. Because otherwise I will have to kill you. Interfering bastards. Assholes. Thankfully B did not believe them or else I would have been caught and unprepared and who knows how life would've turned out. )

Refused entry: David Toube and their 10-year-old son were turned away from a 'Muslim-only' swimming session
A father and their five-year-old son were turned away from their local swimming pool because they were the wrong religion.
David Toube, 39, and their son Harry were told that the Sunday morning session was reserved for Muslim men only.
Hackney Council, which runs the Clissold Leisure Centre in Stoke Newington, north London, claimed staff there had made a mistake.
However, the Muslim-only session was advertised on its website.
Mr Toube, a corporate lawyer, described their experiences on a blog.
"I arrived at the pool to discover that they were holding what staff described to me as "Muslim men only swimming"," they wrote.
"I asked whether my son and I could go as we were both male. I was told that the session was for Muslims only and that we could not be admitted. I asked what would happen if I turned up and insisted I was Muslim.
"The manager suggested that they might ask the Muslims swimming if they minded my son and I are swimming with them. If they didn't object, we might be allowed in."
A few days later, Mr Toube, who lives with their wife, 38-year-old barrister Samantha, and their two sons in Stoke Newington, North London, spoke to another leisure centre employee.
"He gave me an identical story. Their explanation was that it was a requirement of the Muslim religion that Muslims could not swim with non-Muslims."

The swimming pool at Clissold Leisure Centre where the father and son were barred from
Mr Toube joked: "I asked them whether Clissold Leisure Centre would institute Whites Only swimming for racists. Their answer was that they would if there was sufficient demand."
They added: "I spoke to a number of Muslim friends, and none of them had heard of a religious prohibition on swimming with non-Muslims.
"One friend was so disgusted with Hackney for trying to segregate Muslims and non Muslims that they suggested that they take their little daughter swimming with us, just to prove the point."
However, Dr Taj Hargey, chair of the Muslim Education Centre of Oxford, said it was not true that Muslims could not swim with non-Muslims.
"There is no Koranic verse or any statement from the sources of Islam that says different religions should be segregated," they said.
"The only requirement is that when women swim they should be modestly clad."
The Prophet Mohammed is recorded as saying that it is a Muslim's duty to learn to swim as it could save their or their life.
The swimming sessions for male Muslims were advertised as taking place every Sunday from 8am to 9.30am.
Leaflets stipulated: "It is compulsory for the body to be covered between the navel and the knees.
"Anyone not adheres to the dress code or rules within the pool will not be allowed to swim. All brothers welcome.'
A leisure centre spokesperson said staff were wrong to refuse entry to Mr Toube.
They added: "The member of staff the user spoke with at the time was mistaken when referring to the session as Muslim-only.
"The men's modesty session is not a private hire and is, therefore, open to the public.
"Staff cannot ask your religion on entrance and you won't be refused entry if you don't appear to be Muslim."
A spokesperson for the Equality and Human Rights Commission said: "Segregating services may amount to unlawful discrimination and could create a sense of unfairness, inadvertently increasing community tension."
What makes a company great to work for?
Good pay and benefits don't hurt. But when it comes down to it, employees said it's office culture and great colleagues that make these companies satisfying places to work.
Glassdoor asked people about the pros and cons of their employers, and had them rate their company between one and five stars.
More than 800,000 responses were submitted between November 2013 and November 2014. Here are the 10 companies with more than 1,000 employees that ranked the highest:
Google
Sure, the pay is outstanding, but so is the work. "My work is used by lots and lots of users. It's cool stuff that makes people happy," says one Google (GOOG) staffer.
Bain & Company
The people are incredible, says one employee. "There's a mix of intelligence but also humility that you don't find at the other top consulting firms."
Nestle Purina PetCare
The company's "strong midwestern roots" make it a great place to work, as do the "vast opportunities that come with an international giant parent company," said one engineer. It is a subsidiary of Nestle based in St. Louis.
F5 Networks
"My skills are getting better, and there is a clear career path for software engineers that don't want to go into management," said one F5 Networks (FFIV) software engineer.
Boston Consulting Group
Outstanding colleagues, according to one respondent. "The best and the brightest from all fields and backgrounds (think Rhodes scholars) create a really rich intellectual atmosphere."
Chevron
Employees said they are pleased with the pay, benefits and "excellent" retirement program at Chevron (CVX).
HEB
"One of the few companies that actually cares about its employees," said one of the grocery store chain's workers.
In-N-Out Burger
Most fast food workers complain about pay and hours, but In-N-Out Burger bucks the trend. One worker said the chain offers "great pay rates" and "fantastic hours."
McKinsey & Company
The team is a "really amazing set of people" who are "caring, challenging, and whip smart," said one staffer.
Mayo Clinic
A professional work environment, state-of-the-art facilities, and collaboration between departments add up to a great working environment, says a research associate.

Bernie Sanders gave an interview to the editorial board of New York Daily News last week in which they laid out their plan for reforming Wall Street. They have taken criticism from all around in the past few days for their answers, which many readers felt were vague.
Writers for The Atlantic, Vanity Fair, CNN, Slate and Talking Points Memo as well as The Washington Post concluded that Sanders had botched the interview, and that they aren't prepared to answer important practical and logistical questions about their policies.
For example, Sanders was faulted for not having formed an opinion on a recent ruling in federal court. "It's something I have not studied, honestly," they said.
A closer look at the transcript shows that Sanders's conversation with the Daily News was more nuanced than some of the criticism might suggest. That federal court ruling, for instance, remains under seal, and experts on the financial sector said there were additional reasons that Sanders couldn't give precise answers to several of the questions that were put to him.

Some aspects of the debate over banking reform remain uncertain simply due to the complexity of managing Wall Street -- a responsibility shared by corporations, judges and federal agencies. At moments when the discussion became especially technical, it seemed that both Sanders and their interviewers didn't completely understand each other.
"It's not that they don't have policy knowledge," said Avik Roy, who has advised former GOP presidential candidates Rick Perry, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Mitt Romney.
"As an economist, sure, I'd love to see them spell everything out," said Dean Baker, a director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "Did they give reasonable answers that gave people a reasonable idea of what they would do? Yeah. I didn't see any big scandal there."
How to break up the banks
When it comes to breaking up the banks, reformers have put forward several approaches.
One would be for a president to ask Congress for new laws that would force banks to reduce their size. For example, Congress might place a limit or a tax on banks' total liabilities, as Hillary Clinton, Sanders's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, has proposed.
[Read more: Hillary Clinton may be ready to break up the big banks]
Perry, the former governor of Texas, put forward another idea. Lawmakers could also impose stricter requirements on banks of a certain size, forcing them to stockpile their profits as a kind of insurance policy against a crisis. Requirements of this kind reward banks that remain small, while forcing larger banks to be prepared to bail themselves out instead of relying on taxpayers. The Federal Reserve has already put in place some rules along these lines, but Congress could reinforce them.
Since Congress isn't likely to act, another approach would be for the president to appoint subordinates who would use the authority that Congress granted them in the past to order the banks to divest. A group of regulators directed by the Treasury secretary has this authority under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.
Sanders alluded to both possible approaches in their conversation with the Daily News, according to a transcript of the interview.
"How do you go about doing it?" the senator was asked.
"How you go about doing it is having legislation passed," they replied, "or giving the authority to the secretary of treasury to determine, under Dodd-Frank, that these banks are a danger to the economy over the problem of too-big-to-fail."
While some commentators apparently took this response to indicate that Sanders hadn't thought their plan all the way through, it is also possible that they have considered more than one option if they win the general election, depending on whether Congress is willing to work with him.
In any case, when the Daily News pressed him, they gave an unambiguous answer.
"How?" Sanders was asked. "How does a president turn to JPMorgan Chase, or have the Treasury turn to any of those banks and say, 'Now you must do X, Y and Z?' "
"Well, you do have authority under the Dodd-Frank legislation to do that, make that determination," Sanders explained.
The interviewer's next question seemed to conflate two separate sources of authority -- the Treasury Department and the nation's central bank. "You do, just by Federal Reserve fiat, you do?" Sanders was asked.
While the Federal Reserve also arguably has the power to force banks to dissolve, the central bank would probably need the consent of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in this regard, and would operate with a legal authority distinct from the Treasury secretary's.
"Yeah. Well, I believe you do," Sanders replied -- a confusing answer to a confusing question that nonetheless also drew criticism from the press.
I'll be home for Christmas
The discussion by the editorial board of the Daily News and by other journalists, also could have given the mistaken impression that Sanders wants to place the banks under the direct control of the federal government.
Advocates of banking reform in both parties do not argue that the government should give specific instructions to employees and managers at banks about how to reduce the size of their firms, regardless of the legal technique used to break them up. Instead, Uncle Sam would place broad requirements on the banks, leaving the details of meeting those requirements up to the people on Wall Street.
"We don't want the government running the banks," said Baker, who published a short analysis of the interview in the Daily News online. "We want the government saying you can't be above a certain size -- whatever that might be -- but the banks know how best to organize themselves so as to be as efficient as possible."
Other federal regulations function similarly. Regulators require seat belts in cars, but they don't tell automakers how to manufacture them. They place limits on pollution, but they don't draw up blueprints for power plants.
"If my mom says I have to come home for Christmas, they do not say, 'You have to take this train,' or 'You have to take this flight,' or 'You have to drive,' " said Mike Konczal, an expert on Wall Street at the liberal Roosevelt Institute. "She leaves it to me to figure out the most efficient and effective way to get there." (Konczal, an occasional contributor to Wonkblog, also put their thoughts about the interview online.)
In the interview, the board of the Daily News asked detailed questions about how Sanders would manage the financial sector.
"If you look at JPMorgan just as an example, or you can do Citibank, or Bank of America, what would it be? What would that institution be? Would there be a consumer bank? Where would the investing go?"
"I'm not running JPMorgan Chase or Citibank," Sanders answered.
"No. But you'd be breaking it up."
"That's right. And that is their decision as to what they want to do and how they want to reconfigure themselves. That's not my decision," Sanders said. Some interpreted this response as a dodge, including Sanders's interviewer at the Daily News.
"I'm a little bit confused," the conversation continued, "because just a few minutes ago you said the U.S. president would have authority to order..."
"No, I did not say we would order," Sanders replied, emphasizing the limits of presidential authority over the ins and outs of corporate management. "I did not say that we would order. The president is not a dictator."
"Okay. You would then leave it to JPMorgan Chase or the others to figure out how to break it, themselves up. I'm not quite..."
"You would determine is that, if a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist," Sanders said.
See you in court
Next, Sanders was asked about a federal court's recent ruling against regulators in favor of MetLife, which could limit the next president's authority over Wall Street.
"It's something I have not studied, honestly, the legal implications of that," Sanders answered when asked about the ruling. Sanders was criticized for this remark as well. Yet instead of apologizing, Konczal said, Sanders might have simply pointed out that the decision remains under seal, so the legal implications remain unknown.
Finally, Sanders was asked about their argument for more aggressively prosecuting bankers involved in the financial crisis.
"Do you have a sense that there is a particular statute or statutes that a prosecutor could have or should have invoked to bring indictments?" the senator was asked.
"I suspect that there are. Yes," they said.
"You believe that? But do you know?"
Sanders couldn't answer that question, but they did argue that the federal law enforcement should devote more manpower to investigating the largest financial firms to determine whether any particular laws were violated. Likewise, Clinton has called for federal prosecutors to crack down on Wall Street, and their plan has won plaudits from many commentators on the left.
The Obama administration, though, has largely chosen to accept hefty payments from banks to settle cases, rather than gathering evidence and bringing it into court. The administration's critics say that the chance that investigations would prove unsuccessful has deterred Obama's deputies from pursuing a more aggressive but riskier strategy, like what Sanders and Clinton are proposing.
Clinton joined in the criticism of Sanders's interview. "If you're concerned about income inequality and holding the banks accountable, you have to know how it works and what you have to do to make it work," they told CNN Wednesday.
Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton is not "qualified" to be president because of the donations they accept from the fossil fuel industry, while Clinton questioned whether Sanders's ideas are realistic. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)
'How do you ride the subway?'
Wall Street experts took issue with several planks in Sanders's platform. Konczal noted that Sanders's promise to dissolve the largest financial institutions within a year is simply unrealistic -- it would take them several years, at least, to put the personnel in place to carry out their plans.
Roy, Perry's adviser, excoriated Sanders's proposal to impose a tax on sales of stock and other securities -- which would be a major burden on Wall Street, but which was not discussed in the interview with the Daily News.
"Sanders's overall concern about our banking system is a very justified one, but it's hard for me to see how their policies would have solved the problem," said Roy, who is now at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization.
"It's far from obvious that taxing the banks more is going to change the incentives in banking that led to a financial crisis or that might cause a financial crisis in the future," they added, faulting Sanders for what they called a "simplistic worldview."
There was one question that Sanders clearly flubbed. Here's that exchange, which started when the editorial board asked the native of Brooklyn about their relationship with New York, where Democrats will go to the polls in the primary in two weeks:
Sanders: I know how to ride the subways. I've been on them once or twice. Daily News: Do you really? Do you really? How do you ride the subway today? Sanders: What do you mean, "How do you ride the subway?" Daily News: How do you get on the subway today? Sanders: You get a token and you get in. Daily News: Wrong. Sanders: You jump over the turnstile.
The good news for Sanders is that riding the subway in New York isn't nearly as complicated as preventing the next financial crisis.
Frank Rich does what he's doing a lot of lately; they weave two columns into one. Both virtual columns are worth reading, but they need to be teased apart.
In the first “column” (the first strand of their interwoven two), Rich considers whether the Teabags in Congress will shut the government down like their Contract-on-America counterparts did in 1995. They conclude that while 1995 was a GOP disaster, they think this time will be different:
Rather hilariously, the Republicans' political gurus still believe that Gingrich's ruse can work. In a manifesto titled “How the G.O.P. Can Win the Budget Battle” published in The Wall Street Journal last week, Fred Barnes of Fox News put it this way: “Bragging about painful but necessary cuts to Medicare scares people. Stressing the goal of saving Medicare won't.” But the G.O.P. is trotting out one new political strategy this time. Current House leaders, mindful that their '95 counterparts' bravado backfired, constantly reiterate that they are “not looking for a government shutdown,” as Paul Ryan puts it. They seem to believe that if they repeat this locution often enough it will inoculate them from blame should a shutdown happen anyway — when, presumably, they are not looking.
Rich offers other evidence of the coming disaster, including the fact that “much of the Beltway press has bought the line that comparisons between then and now are superficial.” Sounds like they're encouraging the Congressional Teabags to go for it.
Rich, of course, thinks this will be another disaster, mainly because of the state of the economy. Killing support from government just when most people — including our eagerly-duped teabag cousins — most need it, almost guarantees that dreaded W-shaped recovery. Get ready. Seriously; get ready.
But it's Rich's second strand I want to focus on, since it echoes a theme we touched on earlier, when considering the Koch Brothers Coup in Wisconsin. Rich documents the unspoken obvious — that Washington is Wisconsin on steroids. The Republican budget proposal is a cesspool of sucking to the super-rich, Kochs included (my emphasis below):
In this bigger picture, the Wisconsin governor's fawning 20-minute phone conversation with a prankster impersonating the oil billionaire David Koch last week, while entertaining, is merely a footnote. … Look to Washington for the bigger story. As The Los Angeles Times recently reported, Koch Industries and its employees form the largest bloc of oil and gas industry donors to members of the new House Energy and Commerce Committee, topping even Exxon Mobil. And what do they get for that largess? As a down payment, the House budget bill not only reduces financing for the Environmental Protection Agency but also prohibits its regulation of greenhouse gases. Here again, the dollars that will be saved are minute in terms of the federal deficit, but the payoff to Koch interests from a weakened E.P.A. is priceless. The same dynamic is at play in the House's reduced spending for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (charged with regulation of the esoteric Wall Street derivatives that greased the financial crisis). The reduction in the deficit will be minimal, but the bottom lines for the Kochs and their peers, especially on Wall Street, will swell. These special interests will stay in the closet next week when the Tea Partiers in the House argue (as the Gingrich cohort once did) that their only agenda is old-fashioned fiscal prudence.
The Koch Brothers Coup — has a nice ring to it. Coming to a sad dying superpower near you.
My take: I'm saddened to bring the blindingly obvious to the unseeing (present company excepted, of course). It's literally the least I can do, which leads me to this.
Isn't it also obvious that, as the Billionaires Coup gets closer and closer to victory, their hubris brings them closer and closer to killing the cow they're milking?
I don't think that answer is in question. They really are flirting with killing the country. (Well, they're probably well past “flirting”; the roofie's been administered, teabag-style.) Frank Rich's column makes exactly this point, if obliquely.
So which is it? Have the super-rich decided they don't need America any more? Or are they just so in love with Supply Side Jesus that they don't know they're burning the house down with them inside?
In other words, when this country becomes a faltering second-world economy with a useful first-world military, have the super-rich prepared their financial escape? Do the rich really need the rest of us?
In my view, this is the right question, the only one without an obvious answer. But stay tuned; people have started looking at this in earnest, as have I.

iba-hamburg converts an abandoned nazi bunker
‘energy bunker' by iba-hamburg, hamburg, germany

the hamburg-wilhelmsburg flak bunker was built in 1942 and was in use for the following four years, built as a stronghold equipped with anti-aircraft turrets designed to withstand attacks from the ground or the air during world war 2. local studio iba-hamburg was commissioned to turn the icon into a useful structure for the current day and age. now restored as a public memorial complete with four 30 meter tall towers and an impenetrable concrete envelope, the fortress now serves as the surrounding residential area's renewable energy supply providing heat and power from 85% renewable resources. a steel framing system separated from the faces of the southern wall and roof serve as a substructure for large louvered solar panel strips that output over 100kW per week. at the heart of the bunker, a large storage facility stores up to 2 million liters of water, made in a chamber that was the result of internal explosions triggered at the end of the war. in other rooms, heat is generated through industrial waste, a biomethane gas-driven heat and power unit, and a wood combustion system. in the location of one of the aircraft turrets, 30 meters above the ground, a new cafe has been opened to host the various visitors from around the world.

Update, Thursday: New Line/Warner Bros.' It has clocked past the $500M mark as of today. Split up that's $272.2M domestic, and $227.8M overseas.
“Crossing $500 million is rarified air for any film, but for a horror film it is history-making, and we could not be prouder. The filmmakers and cast did more than make a box office hit; they created a communal, must-see moviegoing event that has reverberated around the globe and is still going strong. We congratulate Andy Muschietti, the extraordinary producing team, and everyone involved in ‘IT' on reaching this amazing milestone,” said Sue Kroll, president of worldwide marketing and distribution in a statement.
It has yet to open in Germany, Italy and Japan. The feature adaptation of the 1986 Stephen King novel has scored the biggest opening weekend ever for a horror film in more than 30 markets, including UK, Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Australia. In 17 of those locations, including the UK, Russia and Australia, the Andy Muschietti-directed movie has become the top-grossing horror film of all time, and still counting.
Previous, Monday Sept. 25: The sequel to New Line's It will be hitting the screen on Sept. 6, 2019. That's the same post-Labor Day frame that the first chapter launched in, racking up an unprecedented $123.4M domestic opening — the best September has ever seen.
Andy Muschietti directs the second half of Stephen King's novel which focuses on the Loser's Club, 27 years later, when they've grown up and away. But then a devastating phone call brings them back.
The latest news puts the Warner Bros./New Line sequel in a game of chicken with Blumhouse's untitled horror film which moved on to that date last week. We hear that the Blumhouse title moving forward on that Friday isn't the Akiva Goldsman-directed reboot of Stephen King's Firestarter, rather an original horror pic from the genre label.
It has been an unprecedented success at the September box office in ways that no one ever imagined. Among some of the records that It owns: largest opening for a horror film stateside, the biggest opening for an R-rated film, the largest opening for a pic based on a book, best preview night for a horror film ($13.5M), the best IMAX opening for September and horror pic, and best opening for a New Line release. Worldwide It is nearing close to a half billion, and at the domestic B.O., it's already the largest horror film ever with $266.1M, beating The Exorcist late last week.
In addition, Warner Bros. announced today that the untitled animation film on June 1 next year has moved to July 27 and is now known as Teen Titans Go!
In 2012, most opinion polls suggested that Boris Johnson would win the London mayoral election by a landslide. Part of the reason they didn't was because of public anger over George Osborne's "omnishambles" budget. Osborne's cuts to the top rate of tax, while cutting benefits for the worse off, was a major error that hurt the Tories' polling position for years to come.
In the end, Boris came fairly close to losing that year, with some of their senior team convinced they had fallen short early on in the night. As the results came in, Osborne's name was cursed by a number of Johnson supporters in City Hall.
Now history looks to be repeating itself. Several polls in the past few days have shown Osborne's budget this week has put a dent in support for the Tories, with one poll today showing Labour with their first lead since the general election. If Zac Goldsmith does fail to win in May, Osborne's budget could prove to be one of the biggest reasons why. Ongoing Tory infighting over Europe, which Zac has partly helped to fuel, could also be a factor.
It wasn't supposed to be this way. Goldsmith's supporters had been expecting a significant boost from the budget, following announcements about Crossrail 2 funding and business rate devolution. They hoped the announcements would put further pressure on Khan over their funding of a fares freeze. A joint photo shoot with the chancellor was even conducted in advance, with the aim of associating the Conservative candidate with Osborne.
The job of Mayor means getting a good deal from Government. Last week I told them what London needs in #Budget2016. pic.twitter.com/DvdMyyaKHW — Zac Goldsmith (@ZacGoldsmith) March 16, 2016
That now looks to have been a mistake. A poll today found that more people thought Osborne's budget was unfair than those who thought it was fair - the first time since Osborne's disastrous budget in 2012. Most unpopular of all was the chancellor's decision to slash benefits for disabled people by over £4 billion. YouGov found that 70% of the public believe this was the wrong priority, compared to just 13% who believe it is a good idea.
The budget is also putting pressure on Goldsmith himself. Their support for disability benefit cuts has become a big local issue for the Conservative candidate, after they were axed as the patron of a disability charity in Richmond. Today the Richmond Times splashed on a story about Zac's removal from the charity with the headline: "Hit the Road, Zac". Goldsmith often likes to boast in hustings that their increased majority at the last general election shows they are appreciated by their constituents. That now looks like a harder line for them to sell.

Goldsmith's chances of winning are still significantly better than the polls and most pundits suggest. Many of the measures in Osborne's budget could prove to be popular in the outer London boroughs Goldsmith hopes will carry them to City Hall. It's also worth remembering that Labour's national position in the polls in May 2012 was significantly better than their national position now and yet the Tories still won the mayoralty.
However, in the past four years Labour's overall position in London has improved and in order to win, Zac needs to overcome Labour's big advantage in the city. The signs from the budget this week are that this advantage has just got bigger.

An emerging coalition of housing activists is calling on Portland leaders to increase density in single-family residential neighborhoods, strengthen renter protections and put a general obligation bond on November's ballot that would fund affordable housing.
Calling itself Portland for Everyone - intentionally modeled after a Seattle for Everyone coalition that recently came together around an ambitious set of housing goals in that city - the group held the first in what it said will be a series of meetings Wednesday night at Revolution Hall in Southeast Portland. Hundreds attended, clapping and cheering in support of a range of policy ideas.
The event - billed "Let's Do More Than Talk: Housing, Land Use, and Affordability in Portland" - was co-sponsored by Portland Forward, a group with similar aims founded by the Portland architect Bing Sheldon, who recently died and to whom Wednesday's event was dedicated.
Portland for Everyone is being funded by the advocacy group 1000 Friends of Oregon. Mary Kyle McCurdy, a policy director and staff attorney at 1000 Friends, said Portland has "the opportunity to do it right or do it wrong, and wrong would be becoming San Francisco."
The coalition is similar to Seattle for Everyone in that it is composed of developers, social justice advocates, environmentalists and urbanists. The group in Seattle came together when Mayor Ed Murray convened a 28-member committee to come up with a compromise after developers threatened to sue the city over affordable-housing mandates. The developers and advocates found common ground and eventually supported the committee's 65 recommendations.
Mike Westling, a member of the City Club of Portland's housing affordability committee that recently released a report calling for "action now," successfully convinced the club to adopt a minority version of that report, taking a stronger position in favor of increased density in single-family neighborhoods. They helped facilitate the Portland for Everyone meeting and said there is a momentum in the air that wasn't here even four or five months ago.
"I think it starts from the shared recognition that the city is changing really rapidly," Westling said.
The high level of interest in the issue coincides with the ongoing efforts at Portland City Hall to rewrite the comprehensive plan and decide on new rules for infill and multifamily housing.
"It's exciting that the planning process is aligning with the need to make sure that if our city is changing, then it's changing in a positive way," Westling said.
The proposals could attract opposition from some neighborhoods. Many in Portland are feeling angst about home demolitions, massive redevelopment, rising prices and heavy population growth.
During the event's opening session, the biggest applause went to Eli Spevak, a local developer and a member of the Portland Planning and Sustainability Commission. Their company, Orange Splot LLC, focuses on smaller, affordable homes with sustainable environmental footprints.
Spevak advocated for more so-called "missing middle" housing - such as duplexes, triplexes, rowhouses, accessory dwelling units and garden apartments. They noted that in 1923, much of Portland was zoned for multifamily housing. Now, it is zoned for mostly single-family neighborhoods.
"Portland is being relatively timid, confronted with the housing crisis we face right now," Spevak said.
Following Spevak was Jes Larson, of the Welcome Home coalition. They said writing new zoning rules to provide more market-rate housing would help ease affordability for middle-class Portlanders, but that more needs to be done for the low-income residents, too. Them group is helping push a bond measure that would raise money from taxpayers to build affordable housing. They asked attendees to fill out a card urging public officials to support the measure.
"This housing crisis is affecting all of us," they said.

WBN caught up with Nevada State Athletic Commission Executive Director Bob Bennett from Las Vegas on Wednesday to get the latest on where Conor McGregor stands for their proposed cross-codes clash with Floyd Mayweather Jr.
Bennett met with McGregor on Valentine's Day this year to iron out some differences between both parties regarding a fine imposed during a UFC press conference in 2016, which the NSAC chief confirmed is now in the past.
McGregor is hopeful of facing Mayweather in the second half of this year and Bennett believes the Irishman is on the right path to securing a dream fight.
“Conor has paid the fine, he's paid the Deputy Attorney General's fees and has been a man of their word. All they have to do now, if he's so inclined to, is apply for a boxing license. He's certainly eligible and we hope that they do,” Bennett exclusively told World Boxing News.
Asked whether they expects ‘The Notorious' to apply soon in order to get the ball rolling on a possible confirmation of their multi-million dollar Pay-Per-View blockbuster with Mayweather, Bennett replied: “I hope to think they are.
“We are the fight capital of the world and we'd love to have them back here in Vegas. We had a very productive, professional and cordial meeting with Conor and their attorneys. Their litigation is over, he's paid their fine as we had a rehearing and they paid what was asked of him.”
On the fight itself, which brings together to two biggest names in MMA and boxing for one huge showdown, they added: “I believe it's a win-win situation as Conor's a terrific guy.
“There's a lot of buzz and electricity for a fight with Floyd Mayweather, who's also a phenomenal fighter.
“Mayweather is very smart, they like to hit people and move. They arguably have the best defense in the history of boxing. He's fought all the top contenders and is truly a world champion at 49-0.
“Floyd set a fine example for all boxers before they got out of the business, but now they may come back in for the fight with Conor, so it's definitely an approvable fight and a great one.”

Geopoliticus GI Go Home, Again: The Philippines-U.S. Alliance Weakens Felix K. Chang
September 15, 2016
On Tuesday, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte abruptly demanded that American military advisors on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao “have to go.” Their stated concern was that the presence of American troops on Mindanao antagonized local Muslims and that the troops could become targets of Abu Sayyaf, an extremist Islamic group, for kidnapping and ransom.
The American military advisors were once part of the U.S. Joint Special Operations Task Force-Philippines operating under the authorities of Operation Enduring Freedom-Philippines, headquartered at an airbase near Zamboanga. The task force had been deployed there for a decade as part of a program to train and support elements of the Philippine military in its efforts to combat Islamic militants throughout the region. Last year, that program was wound down and most of the American troops left. But a small detachment of military advisors remained behind.
Precisely why Duterte chose to make their remarks is unclear. They might have been intended to strengthen their hand in peace talks that they reopened with the Philippines' largest Muslim rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), in August. Those talks had been stalled for over a year after a botched anti-terror raid against Islamic militants, including the MILF, resulted in the deaths of 44 Philippine police commandos. The raid derailed their predecessor's attempt to fulfill an accord reached in 2014 under which the rebels agreed to lay down their arms in return for the passage of a law turning a large part of Mindanao into an autonomous region. How successful Duterte's peace talks will be remains to be seen. In early September, Islamic militants bombed a night market in Davao City, where Duterte was once mayor. The blast killed 14 people and wounded 70 more.
Back in Manila, Philippine Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay, Jr. downplayed the impact of Duterte's remarks. According to Yasay, the larger defense relationship between the Philippines and the United States remained “rock solid.” The removal of a “token” number of American military advisors from Mindanao would not affect that relationship or the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement that the two countries signed in 2014.
But Duterte's remarks come at an awkward time in relations between the Philippines and the United States. Only a week ago, at the ASEAN summit in Laos, a meeting between Duterte and President Barack Obama was cancelled after Duterte chided Obama for their criticism of Duterte's anti-drug campaign in the Philippines. While the two men eventually met, the incident amplified doubts over how Duterte's administration would work with Washington.
More broadly, Duterte's remarks reflected the deep ambivalence many Filipinos on the political left feel about the United States. They would prefer it if the Philippines distanced itself from its one-time colonial ruler. Indeed, Duterte already put a halt to the joint Philippine-American naval patrols in the South China Sea. And, recently, they stated that they would favor buying weapons from China and Russia, rather than the United States.
Unfortunately, the Philippines needs the United States, at least until the Philippine armed forces can build up a credible external deterrent. The last time Manila ordered American forces to leave the Philippines was in the early 1990s. Soon thereafter, China took advantage of the weakened alliance to seize Philippine-claimed Mischief Reef. Today China has not only fortified the reef, but also reclaimed enough land there to build an airfield on it. Duterte's remarks give China another opportunity. Duterte may believe they can reach accommodation with China without the United States. But that accommodation will likely be on Chinese terms.
Writing about the politics of Hurricane Harvey is difficult — necessary but difficult. Politics is part of everything, up to and including disaster response, and ignoring it is to pretend otherwise and forfeit your role as a watchdog.
The problem is that you can get it very wrong. And Politico just got it very wrong.
The main Politico account tweeted this cartoon from Pulitzer Prize-winner Matt Wuerker early Wednesday afternoon. The backlash was swift, and the tweet was quickly removed, though the cartoon remained on the website as of this posting.
If you want to know what .@politico thinks about the victims of #Harvey, here is the cartoon they just tweeted, then deleted. pic.twitter.com/9cr0Ne2Z06 — Buck Sexton (@BuckSexton) August 30, 2017
A sampling of the reactions:
this is gross https://t.co/1RyHsedhQd — Betsy Woodruff (@woodruffbets) August 30, 2017
And ignorant. Is the cartoonist not reading about/seeing the extraordinary efforts of individual Texans saving neighbors and strangers? https://t.co/xXMlD0XHIg — Scott Wilson (@PostScottWilson) August 30, 2017
That Politico cartoon is idiotic and insulting for a bunch of reasons. https://t.co/ktQ3xQQHdV — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) August 30, 2017
This is beneath the publication. https://t.co/r68WLymai0 — Kyle Feldscher (@Kyle_Feldscher) August 30, 2017
The first problem with the cartoon is its crassness. People are still being saved, and it's making fun of those same people.
The second problem is the stereotypes. It's almost a caricature of what you'd expect a liberal cartoonist to draw in response to conservative Texans relying upon the government in their time of crisis. The Confederate flag T-shirt. The Gadsden Flag. The reference to being saved by God (which seems extremely dismissive of Christianity). The Texas secession banner. It's all kind of ... predictable?
The third problem is that, while this tragedy struck Texas, a red state, the most acute devastation in a populous area is in Houston. Harris County went for Hillary Clinton by double-digits, and neighboring Fort Bend County was blue as well. The population of both combined is more than 5 million — about one-fifth of the entire state of Texas.
But perhaps more than anything, the cartoon is a needlessly vast oversimplification of a very complex issue at a very sensitive time. There seems to be an attitude among some on the political left in America that people who believe in smaller government and lower taxes believe everything should be privatized and that the government shouldn't be counted on to do anything. There is an attitude that if you don't believe government should play a major role in something or increasing funding for something, you don't believe in that thing.
As flood waters continue to rise from Hurricane Harvey, President Trump, administration members and Texas officials weigh in on the role of the federal government in disaster relief and the long path ahead for Texas's recovery. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
Certainly, there is hypocrisy among some conservatives who may rely upon the government for their livelihoods while decrying big government. And talking about how Texans in Congress voted against Hurricane Sandy relief for the Northeast a few years ago is a valid debate. (They insist it was because the aid wasn't targeted enough and was full of pork. The Washington Post's Fact-Checker poked some holes in those arguments.) But the cartoon suggests that normal people who believe in small government should essentially forfeit government help in their time of need — or, at least, that they should suddenly recognize that their belief in smaller government is wrongheaded.
It's all very smug, and it gives extremely short shrift to very complex issues. People can have reasonable disagreements about how big government should be and what role it should take in disaster response and other issues. But until you declare yourself an anarchist, you probably believe that the federal and/or state government has some role to play in saving people's lives. That's a very basic government function.
And the idea that a bunch of Confederate flag-T-shirt-wearing tea partyers in Texas are suddenly learning the error of their ways seems like a poor way to have a constructive dialogue.
Update: Wuerker comments to the Washington Examiner, saying they were only targeting those calling for secession and wasn't broadly targeting all conservatives:
"As a political cartoonist, I try to get people to think – to consider the ironies and subtleties of the world we live in. This cartoon went with an extreme example of anti-government types – Texas Secessionists – benefitting from the heroism of federal government rescuers," they told the Washington Examiner. "It of course was not aimed at Texans in general, any more than a cartoon about extremists marching in Charlottesville could be construed as a poke at all Virginians," they added. "My heart is with all the victims of Hurricane Harvey's destruction and those risking their lives to save others."
For what it's worth, a 2009 poll showed 18 percent of Texans favored secession, a number that would translate to millions of residents of the state.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Comet customer: "It looks like a plague of locusts have been inside [the store] and cleaned the place out"
The electrical retail chain Comet has appointed Deloitte as administrators, putting 6,611 jobs at risk.
The move confirms private equity firm OpCapita, which bought the 236-store business last year for the nominal sum of £2, has thrown in the towel.
OpCapita hoped to turn the struggling business around, and two weeks ago said it was examining a number of potential bids for the retailer.
Comet's demise is one of the biggest High Street casualties of recent years.
"Our immediate priorities are to stabilise the business, fully assess its financial position, and begin an urgent process to seek a suitable buyer which would also preserve jobs," said Neville Kahn, one of the Deloitte partners appointed as joint administrator.
"Comet has been battling the changing landscape of the electrical retail sector for many years. It has become increasingly difficult for it to compete with online retailers which don't face the same overheads, such as store rents and business rates."
Tight credit
The electricals chain has been hit hard by the drop and subsequent limp recovery in consumer spending in the UK since 2008, which has been particularly acute in the case of the big items that Comet sells.
Many of Comet's customers are first-time home-buyers, according to Deloitte, meaning that business has been hurt by the much tighter conditions in the UK mortgage market.
Information for customers Administrators will have to decide whether Comet vouchers and gift cards will be honoured
Generally, gift cardholders are fairly low on a list of creditors when a business folds
Extended warranties are overseen by a separate business so will remain valid. Only if that company ceased trading would a trust fund be set up to meet obligations to customers who hold extended warranties
The Comet website is currently out of action
According to Deloitte, the company had been pushed to the brink by a cash drain caused by suppliers who had been unwilling to provide credit to Comet. Without such credit, Comet was unable to stock-up for Christmas.
"The inability to obtain supplier credit for the peak Christmas trading period means that the company had no realistic prospect of raising further capital to build up sufficient stock to allow it to continue trading," Deloitte said.
The administrator will run the business as a going concern while it assesses options for sales, closures and liquidation.
Mr Kahn said that all stores would continue to trade in the meantime, and all employees would continue to be paid.
On Thursday, Comet said that customers with outstanding orders were being told it was "business as usual until further notice", and that the group intended to fulfil deliveries of products that had been paid for.
However, when asked on Friday about whether gift vouchers and deliveries would be honoured, Deloitte told the BBC that they "don't have the answers yet" and it was too early for them to say.
Comet's customer care team is handling customer inquiries on 0844 8009595.
At 21:00 GMT on Friday, the company's website was inaccessible - a recurring problem in recent days.
The company's rivals are expected to benefit from the demise of Comet, with shares in Dixons Retail, which owns PC World and Currys, jumping another 11% after climbing 15% on Thursday.
Click tracks are like Kryptonite to musicians. There isn't a lot of enjoyment ones gets from recording with them. Click tracks sound like nails being hammered into a coffin. A coffin you'll find the remnants of your soul whimpering in. Ok, maybe that's a little harsh, but clicks aren't fun and can suck the life out of a groove sometimes.
However, click tracks are often vital to a recording session. They're a necessity, but one that can rob a session of its vibe.
Connoisseur of 8th Notes
One of the shortcomings of a click track is that it's impartial to wherever the 8th note may be sitting. Which means, it really has no feel. Anyone who has spent a lot of time cutting records can write a dissertation on how much the 8th note may vary between grooves. It's a subtle, but hugely important detail.
There is a lot of blank space in between two clicks. A lot can happen in that great canyon of space. A lot of interpretation can be made.
In theory, you could lock to a click and still not have nailed the feel. But how, if it's in time?!?! Playing in time is only part of the job. Negotiating the distance in between the clicks is a far more difficult challenge.
This is one of the things that finessed drummers do. They define the space. I work with a great drummer named Doug Yowell on occasion. Their sensitivity to the placement of the 8th note is super refined. I would say he's a connoisseur of 8th notes. They have a masterful control over the what the youngsters call “quantization' (or what we old types call “feel). It is the space between the notes.
Lava Lamp
My aim is to create a mood while recording. “Click, Click, Click, Click…” may create a mood, but not one of happiness and comfort. A traditional click is often restrictive to an artist's performance.
This led me to the idea of creating my own loops to use as a click track. I would clap my hands, tap keys on glasses, sweep a broom on the floor, stomp my feet and use whatever was around as percussion.
The goal is to create not only a groove in time but one with some sort of feel related to the song.
Of course, once you start doing this, it doesn't give you a lot of flexibility in moving the tempo around. This is why before you even think about recording you should spend some time with a metronome to lock the tempo. Do your homework first!!
Wild Horses
This was the technique I used on the Lonely and the Moose record “And All Of The Space In The Whole Wide World”. We recorded the album in a cabin at a horse ranch in Colorado. Take the song “Lonely” as an example.
The homemade click loop worked so well we decided to keep it on the final recording. On occasion, these loops can become part of the ambience of a song.
Method
To create the homemade click track for the “Lonely”, I did the following: stomp for 4 bars, find the best bar, cut it and loop. I would tap on the countertop for 4 bars and pick the best bar. Then loop it. Next? A broom on the floor to create a scraping sound… and how about some crumbling paper? I kept going until it felt “vibey.”
Drive Thru
If you're not good at recording found sounds, you can also use loops. On a recent session for a Christmas song (XXX Mas Song”, by Bryan Dunn and Andi Rae Healy), I didn't want to use a regular click.
For this session, it was easier for me to just drop in a drum groove using EZ Drummer, especially since live drums were not going to be recorded for the first session. I didn't use a stock midi pattern, though. I wrote in my own part.
The reason I don't like a lot of pre-fab midi grooves is they tend to be busy. Since I grew up originally as a drummer, it's easy for me to program. If that's not in your skill set and you must use a pre-fab groove (nothing wrong with that), start off with something simple and add slowly.
Click Replacement Therapy
If you don't have EZ Drummer or BFD, you can program a simple percussion track using a tambourine or shaker. But, don't just set the click track to play the tambourine on the beats. You want to create something with a feel similar to the song.
ADVERTISEMENT
If you have a sampler like Kontakt or EXS, you can take single hits of sounds you've sampled and use them later for other clicks at different tempos. You can build a library of found sounds that make wonderful click tracks.
I've also used loops from iTabla, which is an app for the iPad. Within the app, there are rhythms for tablas with good samples. Sometimes, it's perfect for the song's vibe.
The Math
You should figure out the lowest common denominator of the song and include that in your loop. If it's an 8th note feel, there should be 8th notes in your homemade click.
If it's a 16th note feel, there should be 16th notes in your homemade click.
This is especially important if there isn't a drummer present as an ambassador to the space between notes which we call “feel.”
All Together Now
If you're playing with a loop or homemade click track, you can include it in everybody's cans. That's another weird thing about click tracks. Some engineers will only feed the click to the drummer.
So, you're following the drummer and the drummer are following the click. Sometimes not everyone is seeing eye to eye and the drummer has to negotiate which direction they lean since he's the only one hearing both.
What do I mean? Say there is a bridge that has a lot of energy. Naturally, everyone wants to push a little. Perhaps it's on the verge of rushing but in a natural, emotional kind of way.
Without a click track, it's easy because everyone is following each other. But when the drummer is chained down, they have the click pulling them one way and the band the other.
Why Ya Gotta Be So Mean To The Drummer?!
By having a cool loop/click track and placing it in everybody's headphones, everyone will play together. Yes, there is still going to be moments when everyone may push forward or behind the beat feel-wise, but everyone has the same relation to the click. Everybody feels the same push and pull.
Tick-Tock
It may seem like a major time suck, but it's worth spending the time to set up. It sets the mood for the feel of the song. Feel is everything! You're better off spending extra time at the beginning of the session rather than risking the musicians getting frustrated later on.
Your goal is to get great performances. Prep time is your best ally to achieve this goal.

PARIS (AP)  A former Iranian diplomat who defected to the West this year says they saw North Korean technicians "repeatedly" travel to Iran, which Western officials fear is trying to develop nuclear weapons. Mohammad Reza Heydari, who resigned in January from their post as Iranian consul in Norway, said he's "certain" the cooperation is continuing between their home country and North Korea. The comments come amid international concerns that North Korea could be actively engaged with Iran in exporting weapons systems and possible nuclear expertise. Heydari spoke Tuesday at a conference in Paris, where they were promoting their efforts to unite international opposition against Iran. Copyright 2010 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

John P. Strohm is an entertainment lawyer and former professional musician based in Nashville, Tennessee. During their musician years they played guitar and wrote songs for Blake Babies and played various instruments in the Lemonheads , while they dabbled in various aspects of the music business. These days they have a much better understanding of the music business, although they still occasionally dabbles in music.
I used to be a full-time musician, and now I'm a proud hobbyist musician. I work in music, and I can't imagine my life without music front and center, but I'm actually much happier playing music without the pressures of trying to be “professional.” I've had to rethink some things and definitely check my ego to be able to do this, but it's been worth it. Through being a hobbyist, I've managed to reconnect with why I got into it in the first place. I got into playing music because it's fun.
Of course, as a kid I daydreamed about being a famous musician. Sort of like how I daydreamed about being a major league baseball player from my perch in right field on a local rec league team. I thought about it, but I didn't think it would ever actually happen. Even after I moved to Boston from my hometown of Bloomington, Indiana, and started making music with Juliana Hatfield and Evan Dando in Blake Babies and the Lemonheads, it was still mostly for fun. I enjoyed playing music more than anything, and for years I worked crappy jobs and lived badly just to be able to keep going. But the goal wasn't a career. The goal was to make something cool and to hang out with my friends, who were also making cool music.
I'm not exactly sure when I decided to make a “career” of music, but that would probably be the precise moment I started to take all the fun out of it. It probably coincided with getting a record deal or starting to get critical acclaim or bigger crowds at shows — trying to act all professional. It definitely coincided with the emergence of that musical style that came to be known as “alternative rock” becoming the flavor of the month on MTV in the early '90s. I think everybody from the underground went a little bit crazy when we saw people like us on TV and it seemed possible to make millions and be no-bullshit huge. Then it started happening to people we knew — Evan, Kim Deal from the Breeders, J Mascis from Dinosaur Jr. Suddenly being underground “famous” while barely covering rent didn't cut it. The idea of success, for a lot of us, crippled our creativity. It became a challenge to make hits.
Straight life sounded like death because it didn't include the things I most enjoyed — or thought I enjoyed.
If you had told me at age twenty-five that by my forties I'd be playing live a few times a year, raising three kids in the suburbs outside Nashville, Tennessee, and going to work in an office every day, I might have wanted to end it then and there. That would have sounded like crushing failure to me, because I had so much invested in “making it” in music, whatever that meant. I wasn't really even chasing fame or trying to get rich by that point; I'd just convinced myself that there wasn't anything else I could do. Straight life sounded like death because it didn't include the things I most enjoyed — or thought I enjoyed. Then I actually had kids, made a family, found something other than music I liked to do — and I discovered joys I never knew in my work and in being a dad. But all the while, I mourned what I felt I'd lost.
I went through a deeply depressing period in the late '90s during which I had to come to terms with the reality of my chosen “career.” There was a stretch when I couldn't listen to alternative rock radio because it reminded me of so many disappointments — disappointments in my own career, but also disappointments with how the whole rock business had turned out. The underground I came from wasn't so much about commerce; it was about community and creativity. In navigating those changes, music became a source of stress and anxiety. I began to measure the success of the shows I played against how many people paid to get in, not the quality of the music or on my own enjoyment. The thing I'd loved the most had become sort of joyless.
Throughout the 2000s, as my wife and I had kids and made a home in Birmingham, Alabama, and as I found my way in my law career, I continued to occasionally play shows. I felt some sense of obligation to keep a foot in the door of my former life. But playing shows meant keeping a band together, and if I only played once every few months, I couldn't expect to be a priority to the best musicians in town. So every time I played, I had to teach people my songs, which meant more work than I had time to do. I didn't particularly enjoy those shows, because, even though I'd stopped pursuing a career, I held on to the same misguided ideas about my own relevance. I was still mourning the death of my previous dreams.
Nobody saw me as a failure because my bands fell apart.
Eventually, I gave up trying to do music and it became a mostly private hobby. For a few years I hardly played at all. Then, I started picking around the house, and occasionally getting together to make music with friends reintroduced me to the joy of the act. When my law practice developed to the point of representing musicians who are far more successful than I ever was, I had to come to terms with my music career meaning more in my mind than it did objectively. People were curious about what I'd done before; some people were even impressed. But, in the end, nobody really cared, which came as some relief. Certainly nobody saw me as a failure because my bands fell apart.
When I started to get asked to play with people again, I devised a formula for when I'd be willing to play music in public, and it had nothing to do with accolades or career advancement. First and foremost, playing music had to be fun. And it can't be a lot of work, which goes hand-in-hand with it being fun. Next, mostly as a concession to my penny-pinching wife, it has to not cost me much out of pocket. That's right — I'm a hobbyist, and usually when I play out, it actually costs me money. So the standard is that it can't cost me too much. As much as I'd like to hire session players every time I play in town, I can't afford to pay six or seven hundred dollars for every show. And, finally, of course, it has to be good. Not because I need people to be impressed, but because — back to the top of the circle — if it isn't good, it isn't fun. I'm so grateful for my musician friends (hat tip to Stanton Edward, Courtney Jaye, Ken Coomer and many others) who have given me these opportunities here in Nashville.
The other day I sat in with an informal neighborhood cover band for a block party here in Franklin, Tennessee, where I live, and I checked every box on my list. It was super fun, it was within my skill set, it didn't cost much (saved me the eight dollars I'd have paid for barbecue, in fact) and it sounded great.
Franklin is close to Nashville, so these sorts of things go a little differently than most suburban block parties. When my family moved here for my job, we chose a large suburban development that is a paradise for kids. When they do things like a Memorial Day block party here, it's a huge function for hundreds of people with dozens working to make it happen. The band is a serious undertaking. The bandleader, Vic White, is a former pro keyboard player who works in finance and tours with an impressive and successful Journey tribute band that plays such things as cruise ships, fairs and sporting events. One of the guys in the band, Keith Landry, used to be in Toto. Others have had their own record deals. I'm not some sort of ringer among these players — I'm a specialist. Vic knows not to ask me to sit in on Steely Dan or Billy Joel songs, and it's not necessarily a matter of taste or trying to be cool. Those songs are better left to the experts who can pull them off, with horn sections, arranged vocals, real percussion. I come in for the Heartland Rock portion, music that's in my DNA. The radio jams of my childhood that got me into this mess in the first place.
I'm not going to take up golf or ham radio. Music is my hobby, and I'm proud.
This year, for my third appearance with the band in the past year, I challenged Vic — and, more than anyone, myself — by asking to sing “Thunder Road” by Bruce Springsteen. Vic's band can actually emulate the E-Street Band pretty well, so the rest was up to me. It took a lot of work to learn that one to the point of being able to more or less pull it off live — but that's not the sort of “work” I avoid. The work I'm concerned about is, for example, driving out of town to play or making other people come to band practice. Sitting down with a record and learning something until it's all the way there — that's joyous in itself. The other songs I knew already (some Tom Petty, Fleetwood Mac), songs I love and could hear every day. But “Thunder Road” for an occasional singer — that's like a casual hiker deciding to climb Denali with a week to prepare.
OK, fair enough — that's an exaggeration. But the point is, once I'd learned the song and stood up in front of that fantastic band just nailing it, that was joyous. The audience of people sitting in lawn chairs munching barbecue, the kids running around in front of the stage, that's perfect too. It's like being on the bandstand on the village green, making music for regular folks having a nice day out. And because it's Franklin, some of those regular folks are pro musicians and producers and record company presidents. For me, however, there's nothing but the joy of the moment, and in that sense I'm right back to where I started in high school with my first few times on stage. The thing itself was enough. No need for after-hangs or hoping to get signed or slaps on the back — just the buzz of pulling it off, losing myself in the moment.
I plan to make original music again someday for real, when I have time. I've written a bunch of songs I think are decent, and I'm starting to think about what a record would sound like. Songs keep coming, and I know if I don't let people hear them, they'll be lost to time. It's important to me to get something done and get it out, but “getting it out” probably just means making it available to my friends and people I care about. It's more about the process of writing, editing, demoing, recording and sharing than it is about trying to make money or getting people to care. But more important is that I plan to play.
I'm not going to take up golf or ham radio. Music is my hobby, and I'm proud. I'm finding people already who share my criteria for when to play, people with similar backgrounds to mine. And I'm already finding a day or two every month to do what I truly love. And for now, that's enough. That and the occasional suburban block party so I don't lose my edge.
Two days ago, right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh said that Hurricane Irma's news coverage was a ploy to create "fear and panic," and predicted that the storm probably wouldn't impact the major population centers of South Florida.
It took Limbaugh about a day to change their mind.

On Thursday, the bag of bluster announced that he'd be going to be taking a hiatus from their Palm Beach, Florida, house and studio, leaving someone else to handle theirs show.
http://twitter.com/fineout/status/905855934408396801
Limbaugh's previous statements indicated that they were unsure that there would be serious devastation to areas — it was all media hype! — and, on Thursday, they stood by those remarks. They argued that, if you're not going to be in the eye of the storm, it won't be as bad as the media and government say it would be.
So when they say “hurricane category 4, maximum sustained winds 155 miles,” there is a place where that is happening, but it's not very large. It's not the whole hurricane. But all of this is done on purpose because — and once it's committed to, once you reach the three-day forecast range, which we're in now, 72 hours out, once you reach that, they're committed.
But even as Limbaugh cast doubt on the government's forecasts, they heeded them in case they were right.
They're committed to it. It's part of the way they warn. Even if they think that it's gonna turn and be offshore east, they can't move that track in advance of that happening, because they can't be sure. If they were to move that track offshore east, say tonight at five o'clock, in two hours, and it moves and they're right, but then late Saturday night it makes a jog left back over land, they would be in deep doo-doo, because people believe them too. And they can't afford now that they've invested and committed to a landfall in south Florida, they have to stick with that until the hurricane makes a move that is off that track. They can't make a move now because of the model.
President Donald Trump's seaside resort Mar-a-Lago has also been ordered to evacuate as Irma, a ferocious category 4 storm, approaches Florida.
Last year, Limbaugh revealed how damaging a category 4 storm would be. They also blamed Obama for part of the panic during Hurricane Matthew, while admitting that yes, being in a hurricane is actually pretty bad!

Now, we've lived through Category 2s here, and they are devastating. You lose power and you lose your phone lines and trees are blown over and the roads are impassable, and there's some home damage, depending on the construction of the home and how old it is. It's not pretty. Category 1 even can feature some of that. Category 4, like is headed for the East Coast of Florida right now could be catastrophic if it comes ashore.
Just remember: Even Rush Limbaugh listens to the meteorologists.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Workers in Mexico City watched as the quake caused building to sway
An earthquake of 6.4 magnitude has shaken parts of Mexico, causing buildings to sway in the capital.
The US Geological Survey said it was centred near the town of Tecpan de Galeana in southern Guerrero state, about 190 miles (300km) south-west of Mexico City.
It was also felt in the resort city of Acapulco, the Associated Press says.
There are no reports of any damage or injuries but frightened office workers ran into the streets in the capital.
'Too scary'
Engineer Daniel Rodriguez, 55, fled their second floor office. "At first it felt like a jolt and then it started to move," they told AFP news agency.
"The floor I was standing on started to creak," another office worker said.
And business person Carmen Lopez told AP: "That was just too scary."
Mexico lies on top of three continental plates and is regularly shaken by tremors.
Finance Minister Luis Videgaray was mid-speech at the National Palace in Mexico City when the latest quake struck, Reuters reports.
"I think we'd better take a pause if you don't mind," the news agency quoted them as saying.
The quake had a depth of 15 miles (24km).
The US Geological Survey downgraded the magnitude from an earlier figure of 6.8.
A 7.2-magnitude quake with an epicentre about 40 miles (66 km) from Thursday's quake shook central and southern Mexico last month.
In 1985, at least 10,000 people were killed in Mexico City by a magnitude 8.1 earthquake.
Delhi's Anti-Corruption Branch on Thursday, carried out searches at office here in connection with complaints by a former chief secretary and an ex-chief of the panel.
officials claimed that they had intimated the that they will be coming to collect certain documents regarding the complaints.
Former chief Barkha Shukla Singh, an ex-MLA from Congress who was heading the panel till last year, had filed a complaint with recently alleging "nepotism and favouritism" by its current chairperson in appointing employees to
They had claimed that several AAP supporters were given plum posts in the women's panel, an allegation strongly denied by Maliwal.
In another complaint, former Delhi Chief Secretary had alleged that Maliwal was misusing their official position by issuing a showcause notice to a club of which they are a member.
A woman had claimed that Sehgal had harassed them by bumping into them constantly in the club's swimming pool. The woman had claimed that they and their husband were suspended from the club after they filed an FIR against Sehgal.
DCW had sought a reply from the club on the suspension of the couple's membership and the club's failure to forward the woman's complaint to the local complaints committee.
Maliwal could not be reached for their reaction on the searches.
PACIFICA, CA- A driver in a crash that happened early Christmas morning on state Highway 1 in Pacifica has been identified as 23-year-old Daly City resident Joebel Pagarigan, according to the San Mateo County coroner's office.
The first report of the collision came in at 2:39 a.m. on Dec. 25 after Pagarigan was apparently traveling the wrong direction in a Toyota Corolla on northbound Highway 1 near Paloma Avenue, according to the California Highway Patrol.
They collided with a Nissan Maxima driven by someone working for the ride-booking service Uber and was pronounced dead at the scene, CHP officials said. North County Fire Authority firefighters arrived and found the Toyota had overturned and caught fire in the center median.
The Nissan was reported as having major damage and was on an embankment, fire officials said. The Nissan driver was taken to the hospital with serious injuries, while a passenger in the car, identified by the coroner's office as 25-year-old Jason Gilbride of Pacifica, was also pronounced dead at the scene.
Uber issued a statement following the crash. "We are deeply saddened by this terrible tragedy," an Uber spokesperson said. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and with the injured driver and their loved ones."
CHP officials do not yet know whether alcohol or drugs played a factor in the collision, which remains under investigation.

Philip G. Epstein (August 22, 1909 – February 7, 1952) was an American screenwriter most known for their screenplay for the film Casablanca (1942), which won an Academy Award. They had written it in partnership with their twin brother Julius and Howard Koch as an adaptation of the unproduced play Everybody Comes to Rick's, written by Murray Bennett and Joan Alison. [1]
Epstein was born to a Jewish family [2] in New York City and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan; their identical twin brother was Julius Epstein . Their father Harry was a livery stable owner in the days when horses were widely used in the city. They and their brother Julius attended Pennsylvania State College (now Penn State University), gaining their degree in 1931. Following college, Philip took up acting and Julius became a professional boxer. [3]
Epstein married. Their son Leslie Epstein directs the creative writing program at Boston University and is a novelist. In 2003, Leslie published a fictionalized version of their boyhood titled San Remo Drive: A Novel from Memory. [4] Their grandson Theo Epstein is president of baseball operations for the Chicago Cubs and previously was the general manager of the Boston Red Sox . Their granddaughter Anya Epstein is a screenwriter.
After college the Epstein twins headed to Hollywood, hoping to work in the movie industry. They became successful screenwriters. Jack L. Warner, head of Warner Brothers, had a love-hate relationship with the Epstein twin brothers. They could not argue with their commercial success, but they deplored their pranks, their work habits and the hours they kept. In 1952, Warner gave the brothers' names to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). They never testified before the committee, but on a HUAC questionnaire, when asked if they ever were members of a "subversive organization," they wrote, "Yes. Warner Brothers."
Epstein died of cancer in Hollywood, California in 1952 at the age of 42.[1] Julius outlived them by forty-eight years, dying in 2000 at age 91.

Not since the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt, more than two millennia ago, has piracy on the Nile River been a significant issue. But the threat of piracy may soon emerge as a critical new aspect to the South Sudanese conflict in 2015. Although the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will continue to airlift internally displaced persons and refugees , the World Food Program and other international aid agencies have indicated that barges on the Nile River and airdrops are cheaper alternatives to airlifting food aid and equipment. Barge convoys have not previously been possible due to the close of the border between Sudan and South Sudan following the latter's declaration of independence in 2011, but this restriction was lifted by the Sudanese authorities in early 2014 and aid may now flow freely down the Nile to conflict-affected communities.
This new traffic on the Nile has already come under attack. In April 2014, a barge convoy en route to the UN base in Malakal, South Sudan, came under small arms fire. Rocket propelled grenades fired at the convoy reportedly wounded four crew members and UN peacekeepers, imperiling delivery of 65,000 kilograms of food rations, 372,000 litres of diesel fuel, and other important supplies. Although this has been the only reported attack on a Nile convoy to date, the security situation on this waterway affords ample opportunity for piracy in the future.
For example, rogue elements of the Sudanese Navy could potentially interfere with aid shipments on the Nile. Although much of Sudan's maritime forces are stationed at naval bases on the Red Sea coast, the country does have approximately 16 inshore patrol vessels which could just as well raid supply convoys as defend them. For its part, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which functions as the newly independent Republic of South Sudan's military, does not possess any formal maritime forces. As some recent economic and sociological research has indicated, an increase in legitimate economic activity in a given area without a proportional increase in security presence can lead to a rise in criminal activity, particularly directed toward exploiting the increase in the asupervisorstioned legitimate commerce. The lack of professional maritime forces on the Nile suggests that little could be done to save a UN barge convoy were it to be faced with a determined enemy.
Both the SPLA and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-in-Opposition (SPLM-IO) denied involvement in the April 2014 attack and it can also be said that both parties are still bound by the 1995 Agreement on Ground Rules in South Sudan, which specifically prohibits attacks on humanitarian convoys. But it is difficult to ensure the Ground Rules are upheld by all the parties to an intra-state conflict, especially when governance is weak among both South Sudan's internationally recognized authorities in Juba and the rebel forces. In the 2014 edition of the Fund for Peace's Fragile States Index, South Sudan is listed as the world's worst failed state, where internal disorder is even deeper than that seen in Syria or the Central African Republic. Under such conditions, splinter groups are constantly being formed and disenfranchised members of the SPLA or SPLM-IO could readily undertake piratical activities if presented with the opportunity.
Perhaps the best means by which to stave off a pirate threat on the Nile is for concerned Western states to invest in enhanced maritime capabilities for Uganda. This landlocked East African state nonetheless possesses inshore patrol vessels to maintain security on those sections of the Nile River and Lake Victoria within Ugandan borders. The Marine Wing of the Ugandan People's Defence Force possesses eight riverine patrol vessels, each of which with a displacement of less than 100 tons. Given previous remarks by Ugandan officials regarding counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and the role of Ugandan forces in support of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), it is clear that there is a political will in Uganda to see an African-led response to piracy. Much as Canada donated 105 armoured personnel carriers to the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) in 2005, inshore patrol vessels could be donated to the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) with the understanding that these will be primarily manned by Ugandan troops already familiar to some extent with policing the Nile.
Uganda has been accused of interfering in the South Sudan conflict, supporting the SPLA while calling for reconciliation with the SPLM-IO. But the continued presence of Western diplomatic offices in Juba suggests Uganda is not alone in its support of the SPLA and President Salva Kiir. It would be unfair and impractical for potential donor countries to exclude Ugandan forces from a maritime component to UNMISS. Furthermore, inshore patrol vessels restricted to escorting barge convoys would not afford Ugandan forces any opportunity to further intervene in the South Sudan conflict, functioning primarily as a deterrent to those groups which might otherwise see aid shipments as targets of opportunity.
This would not address the threat posted to UN barge convoys as they pass through Sudanese waters, unfortunately. As mentioned previously, it is not only South Sudan's section of the Nile that can be dangerous but Sudanese authorities would most certainly object to the presence of Ugandan forces so far north on the Nile. Without escorts for part of the voyage, attacks could still occur and the donation of the inshore patrol vessels to UNMISS or directly to Uganda might accordingly be seen by potential donors as a futile act. To make matters worse, in a crisis scenario whereby aid is airlifted to an Egyptian airbase rather than to a locale in Sudan or South Sudan, the barge convoy would also be unescorted on the Egyptian section of the Nile. Attacks by Egyptian-based terrorists or pirates would not be unthinkable. As recently as October 2014, Islamist militants launched a series of attacks in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, reportedly killing 33 Egyptian security personnel.
Clearly, the Nile is becoming an increasingly unsafe waterway, just as UN agencies are looking to minimize costs associated with delivering humanitarian aid. Yet barge convoys may be the safest option available when one considers the risks associated with airlifting or airdropping aid. In December 2012, the SPLA reportedly shot down a clearly marked UN helicopter conducting reconnaissance in the eastern Jonglei region of South Sudan. In August 2014, another UN helicopter was shot down, likely by SPLM-IO forces although an investigation into the incident is ongoing. UNMISS aircraft come under attack from time-to-time, making airdrops and airlifts risky indeed. In comparison, the April 2014 attack on the Malaka-bound barge convoy may seem to UN officials a relatively small price to pay in the fight against famine and disease in South Sudan. If that is the case, it is imperative that patrol vessels be obtained to defend White Nile ports in South Sudan like Renk, Shambe, and Malakal. This gesture would prevent UNMISS from inadvertently contributing to the instability of its host country.
Dear EarthTalk: I've heard that there are plans to build a large repository for nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain in Nevada, but that plans have been slow and are very controversial. Where is our nuclear waste kept now and what dangers do it pose?
-- Miriam Clark, Reno, NV
Plans to store the majority of our nation's spent nuclear fuel and other highly radioactive waste at a central repository underneath Yucca Mountain in the Nevada desert 80 miles from Las Vegas were first hatched in the mid-1980s. But the project has languished primarily due to opposition from Nevadans who don't want to import such dangerous materials into their backyard. Critics of the plan also point out that various natural forces such as erosion and earthquakes could render the site unstable and thus unsuitable to store nuclear isotopes that can remain hazardous to humans for hundreds of thousands of years to come.
But the Bush administration is keen to jump-start the project and recently submitted a construction license application to develop the facility—which when completed could hold up to 300 million pounds of nuclear waste—with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). In announcing the filing, Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman said that the facility being proposed can “stand up to any challenge anywhere,” adding that issues of health safety have been a primary concern during the planning process.
But the administration has still not submitted a crucial document declaring how protective the facility will be with regard to radiation leakage. Bush's Environmental Protection Agency concluded that the facility needs to prevent radiation leakage for up to 10,000 years. But a federal judge ruled that to be inadequate and ordered the administration to require protection for up to one million years. The White House argues that the NRC should press on with its review process and that the standard can be settled on later.
Currently, without any central repository, nuclear waste generated in the U.S. is stored at or near one of the 121 facilities across the country where it is generated. Nevadans like Democratic Senator Harry Reid, who has doggedly opposed the Yucca Mountain repository, say it makes more sense to leave such waste where it is than to risk transporting it across the nation's public highways and rail system, during which accidents or even terrorist attacks could expose untold numbers of Americans to radioactivity.
But others say that the current system, or lack thereof, leaves Americans at great risk of radioactive exposure. The non-profit Nuclear Information and Resource Service concluded in a 2007 report that tons of radioactive waste were ending up in landfills and in some cases in consumer products, thanks to loopholes in a 2000 federal ban on recycling metal that had been exposed to radioactivity.
As with all issues surrounding nuclear technology, where and how to dispose of the wastes is complicated. While some environmental leaders now cautiously support development of more nuclear reactors (which are free of fossil fuels) to help stave off climate change, others remain concerned that the risks to human health and the environment are still too high to go down that road. Whether or not the NRC approves plans for Yucca Mountain won't resolve the larger debate, of course, but perhaps the greenlighting of other promising alternative energy sources could ultimately make nuclear power unnecessary altogether.

Rawhide chews have their problems too , but they at least are designed to be eaten by your dog (despite what the creationist diatribe in the movie All Dogs Go to Heaven might tell you, the same can not be said for bones). No chew treat is perfect, but bully sticks, or pizzles are digestible and one of the safer ones out there. Also, they appear to be made out of bull penises, so they make an interesting conversation piece.
1 Buying an Expensive Dog
If you wind up in the market for a dog, you'll have the chance to spend "could have bought a nice plasma TV instead" money on a purebred of some kind. But you should spare no expense getting the highest quality dog possible, right?

Actually, purebreeding is pretty controversial in the dog world. Breed standards put out by organizations like the American Kennel Club lay out precise specifications for each breed. But as animal interaction expert James Serpell points out, the standards are almost completely physical, with only vague terms describing behavior. Some of the standards aren't even physically good for the dogs. Serpell says almost all purebred bulldogs have to be delivered by C-section because people kept breeding the dogs for bigger and bigger heads while they still have the same tiny hips.
The other problem is inbreeding. There's only a limited pool of "perfect" dogs in a breed, and soon enough everyone is everyone's cousin, like European royalty. Also like European royalty, genetic defects start to become more prominent, to the point that every breed has a set of genetic defects it's known for and which conscientious breeders try to watch out for.

Many breeders care a lot about their dogs and make breeding selections based on their dogs' temperament and welfare instead of just trying to make the perfect specimen for display or for sale. But dog breeding is not dissimilar to the fashion industry. The standards and trends that determine pricing are set by a bunch of weird people who care about genetically unrealistic standards that the average dog owner couldn't give less of a shit about.
This leads to a weird counterintuitive dog purchasing landscape where your best bet at getting a happy, healthy dog costs about 1/20th of one that will likely cost you thousands in vet bills, or a drive to the weird farmer who doesn't ask questions and doesn't judge, depending on how compassionate you are.
Some people feel we should eliminate the practice of pure breeding altogether, but as long as greed exists that's unlikely to happen. Still, the next time you're deciding what breed to choose, keep in mind that your best bet at a happy, healthy dog may be to choose "damned if we know." Take a trip to the pound to rescue one that is the mixed up spawn of as much unholy breed-mixing as possible. The more pit bulls that jumped the fence in a poodle owner's back yard up the genetic line, the better.

UFC president Dana White says Georges St-Pierre is out with colitis, which could leave them on the sidelines for a while.
“They called me yesterday and I think it's out that they have colitis,” White told reporters after The Ultimate Fighter 26 finale on Friday night. “So he's out for a minute.”
St-Pierre confirmed the diagnosis in a Facebook post on Saturday.
I now understand the health issues that I had during my last training camp… I hoped my condition would improve after the fight but unfortunately it got worse and I had to go straight to the hospital for a colonoscopy when I came back from vacation last Wednesday. The diagnosis is ulcerative colitis and I am now taking medication that will hopefully appease the symptoms. My health is my #1 priority right now, I'm still a very happy man, thanks for your support!!!
St-Pierre made their return to the octagon at UFC 217 after a four-year hiatus, defeating Michael Bisping to win the middleweight title.
I thought it might be interesting to look back and see which Loading Artist comics were viewed the most this year, and then try to give a couple reasons as to why that may be.
Bear in mind these stats do not include any views on reposted versions like on Imgur or on other Facebook pages, etc.
Doing this from 5th too 1st to build that SUSPENSE…!
While I think this one is good enough to gather a lot of views on it's own merits, I think it being the first ‘gag-a-day' Loading Artist comic with the new website layout prompted more shares.
Also, I think that's the best looking girl character I've drawn (not that it has anything to do with it (or does it..)).
I think the gag at the beginning is what makes this comic what it is. Also it's about Bitcoin and that was a hot topic around that time.
FUN FACT: I have an actual ‘Donate Bitcoins' button beneath that comic.
I'm really happy with the pacing in this one. I feel the overlapping speech bubbles at the end add a lot to the timing.
Also there is a cat.
This is one of my favourite comics I've drawn. I'd chalk it up to the combination of colourful visuals (though not too detailed) and length (though not too wordy) with the morbid twist.
‘Born Ready' was interesting to me because it sparked a lot of ‘I don't get it' responses (compared to other ones), and yet it was also many people's favourite comic in a while.
However I think the reason it is the #1 viewed Loading Artist comic this year is mainly because it was the comic that was up while I disappeared to America for two months.
So there you have it. I hope this was somewhat interesting for you, so it doesn't just seem like I'm rambling about the greatness of my comics and what makes them so great.
I have one more blog post planned before the end of the year which goes over what happened with Loading Artist in 2014. Thanks for reading!

Embed Ryan: Republicans Should Vote by 'Conscience,' Don't Have to Back Trump 1:59 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog
Donald Trump finished up the primaries weeks ago, but they can't stop running against imaginary Republican opponents.
The presumptive GOP nominee has struggled in their transition to the general election, and recent surveys show their national support dropping fast: Just over 38 percent of voters back him, according to an average of polls by Real Clear Politics, their worst showing since August 2015.
A major part of their problem appears to be Trump's bizarre insistence on emphasizing topics that divide their own party and unite their opposition. These include their complaints about Judge Gonzalo Curiel's “Mexican heritage,” Trump's repeated sniping at Republican politicians, their renewed call for a ban on Muslim travel and their broader response to the Orlando terror attack, among other topics.
Normally, the post-primary period is a good time for a nominee to do the reverse. A frequent tactic is to find a “wedge issue,” a position on a prominent debate that excites the candidate's base but forces their opponent to risk upsetting different groups within their party.
As The New Republic's Brian Beutler notes, "wedge issues" have a long and storied history. Richard Nixon, for example, famously used crime in 1968 to split black voters and blue-collar whites, two key Democratic voting blocs. George W. Bush used issues like terrorism and gay marriage in 2004 to put Democrats on the defensive with conservative swing voters. In the next election, Barack Obama used the Iraq War's unpopularity to do the same with Republicans.
Related: Ryan Instructs Republicans to Follow Their Conscience on Trump
Rather than find a similar issue, Trump seems obsessed with topics that Democrats are perfectly comfortable to address, but that leave Republicans scrambling to avoid comment.
Why are Republicans running away? The polls tell the story.
To start, Trump's prolonged campaign against Judge Curiel drew a furious response from Republican leaders. An online YouGov/Economist poll asked voters two questions on the topic: whether they felt Trump's argument that the U.S.-born Curiel was biased because they were “Mexican” was correct, and whether they felt Trump's comments were “racist.”
The results indicate a deadly wedge issue for Republicans. The majority of total respondents, 57 percent, thought Trump's suggestion that Curiel was biased was incorrect, versus just 20 percent who felt Trump was right. But Republicans were perfectly split, with 39 percent saying Trump was incorrect and 43 percent saying that they were right. Total respondents called the comments racist by a 51-32 overall margin, but Republicans thought they were not racist by an even wider 65-22 margin.
Remember: Trump asked for this debate. It began after they devoted more than 11 minutes to attacking Curiel in a speech to supporters. But given those numbers, it's not hard to see why Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were so quick to run away.
How about Trump's reaction to Orlando? Similar problem. Trump congratulated themselves on their foresight, renewed their call for a ban on Muslim travel and vaguely accused the president of a secret agenda that might prevent them from stopping terrorism.

The intention seemed aimed to put Democrats on the defensive about their competence and willingness to protect the country. Instead, it had the opposite effect: Democrats not only denounced Trump's comments without a second thought, but they immediately pushed Republicans do the same, many of whom sounded deeply uncomfortable discussing the subject at all.
Like the Curiel attack, polling suggests Republicans might have good reason to run from Trump's response.
A Bloomberg poll this week found 51 percent of likely voters were bothered “a lot” and 15 percent “a little” by Trump's call for a temporary halt to Muslim visitors in the United States. This was close to their findings on the Curiel story, which bothered 55 percent of likely votes “a lot” and 17 percent “a little.”
Bloomberg declined to release crosstabs on the poll by party, but Ann Selzer, the veteran pollster who conducted the survey, confirmed that a “solid majority” of Republicans were not bothered by the Muslim ban.

A CBS News poll taken after the Orlando attack also found 62 percent of adult respondents opposed the Muslim ban, versus 31 percent who expressed support. Just 25 percent approved of Trump overall. The numbers were better in an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll out Thursday that found half of Americans in favor of a ban versus 46 percent opposed.
Trump's recent spats seem unlikely to produce different results. Recently they announced they would welcome North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un to talks in America, a position Republican officials are highly unlikely to support based on their longstanding objections to talks with rogue states like Iran. Trump has also continued to attack Republican critics, including former nominee Mitt Romney and former GOP rival Jeb Bush, something that almost by definition only divides the party.
Creating divisive fights is an added problem for Trump, because one of their signature issues – immigration – is already a classic wedge between Republicans. Trump advocates rapidly deporting all 11 million estimated undocumented immigrants by force, but polls consistently show Americans favor a path to legal status by a wide margin.
Related: Obama Blasts Trump's Muslim Ban: 'Where Does This Stop?'
A Pew Survey in March found 75 percent of voters support earned legalization for immigrants, including 59 percent of Republican respondents. In exit polls of GOP races, Republicans favored deportations over earned legal status in just two out of the twenty states where the question was raised. Republican officials are divided on the topic as well, and few hardliners openly call for mass deportations, as Trump has done.
There are certainly opportunities for Trump to find topics that put Democrats on the defensive. At the top of the list are concerns about Hillary Clinton: The same Bloomberg poll that found voters upset with Trump's positions on Curiel and Muslims also found widespread concerns about Clinton's use of a private email server as Secretary of State, as well as their paid speeches to Wall Street banks.
Republicans would surely rally to Trump's side if they made them a focus of their campaign, but he's so far been unable to concentrate on their opponent for too long without slipping into one of their more divisive issues and then hunkering down once Republicans criticize them over it. At some point, Trump has to ask themselves which party he's running against.
The Australian Law Reform Commission enquiry into Copyright and the Digital Economy has the potential to affect the lives of practically all Australians, so you owe it to yourself to put forward your views on the matter.
As someone who makes a living from stringing words together, I'm the last person to argue that copyright should be abolished. But I do believe our copyright laws need to be much more consistent. For example, where is the inherent difference between reading this article on the screen of a computer or making a paper copy to read on the train? Depending on where you live and when you travel, flashing a tablet during the commute might not be wise.
Why should there be a distinction between recording a free-to-air TV program on a PVR that you own, one that you rent, or one that exists in a data centre? I'm a firm believer in technological neutrality as far as legislation is concerned.
If time-shifting of non-subscription content is acceptable - and I can't see any government going back on that principle - why should it matter how the recording is made, or who is deemed to have actually made it?
And any suggestion that Internet caching should be a breach of copyright is bizarre, except to the extent that it denies revenue to rightsholders where they are remunerated on some kind of ‘pay per view' basis, presumably linked to advertising. Even then, surely all that's necessary is for ‘publishers' to mark as uncacheable the elements used to count views, and to mandate the honouring of no-cache labels.
Otherwise, the copyright regime would appear to be working against cache operators (largely ISPs, but also larger organisations) that are trying to improve the user experience and reduce their - and in consequence the content providers' - costs.
There again, if you've bought and paid for a movie on DVD or Blu-ray, why shouldn't you have the right to transcode and copy it for use on a device without the corresponding optical drive, such as a smartphone or tablet?
And if you want to store that copy on a Cloud server, why shouldn't that be permitted? Remember, you've already paid for the content. Several years ago the content industries were telling us that we were paying for the right to listen/watch/etc, so why do they want us to pay again each time a new kind of player emerges?
For example, if you've purchased a large music library on CD, why should you be expected to subscribe to a music service to listen to those tracks while you're on the move?
You might also be concerned about your right - or lack thereof - to make backup copies of content you've purchased, especially those stored off site. That's another of the 55 questions posed by the ALRC's issues paper http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/copyright-ip42 on which individuals and organisations are invited to comment.
The final two questions concern ‘contracting out' - that is, contract terms that are intended to exclude or limit copyright exemptions.
I believe a fair copyright regime must prevent such contracting out. The problem is that rightsholders are inherently monopolists. There may be several SF shows airing at any given time, but there's only one Fringe. Erotic novels abound, but there's only on 50 Shades of Grey (sequels notwithstanding). Copyright materials are practically always offered to the public on a ‘take it or leave it' basis with no room for negotiation, so exemptions must trump licence ‘agreements'.
So please, download and read the paper, and submit your views to the enquiry on whichever aspects you consider most important. If you don't speak up by November 16, it may be a while before you get another opportunity to influence lawmakers on this matter.
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Noting that this coming Saturday, April 30, 2017, marks President Trump's 100th day as president, the White House has begun listing accomplishments.
“In their First 100 Days President Trump has taken dramatic steps to undo burdensome regulations, restore law and order, bolster our military, revive the American dream, change Washington by holding it accountable, put the American worker first and confirm Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch,” the White House press office said in a statement published Monday.
“The people who put them in office can see and feel the promises they are delivering on. According to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll, an incredible 96% of those who supported the President in November say they'd do it again today,” the White House statement continued.
The White House also summed up President Trump's first 100 days in office “by the numbers, noting the following:
Enacted more legislation and signed more executive orders in the First 100 days than any president in a half century;
Enacted 28 pieces of legislation, more than any other president since Truman;
Signed 25 executive orders, the most of any 100 days in over 50 years (will be over 30 by day 100);
Achieved first Supreme Court Confirmation in 100 days since 1881;
Instituted tough immigration policies that have driven illegal border crossings to a 17-year low;
Removed more job-killing regulations through legislation than any president in U.S. history;
Estimated savings: $18 billion annually;
Economic optimism has been renewed, with consumer confidence reaching its highest level in 16 years; and
Ordered the toughest new rules to stop the revolving door between Washington lobbyists and government officials in history.
Already, the Trump administration can point to accomplishments that fulfill campaign promises.
The Associated Press reported on March 3, 2017 that according to the U.S. Department of Labor, unemployment claims dropped by 19,000 from 242,000 the previous week to the lowest level in 44 years, since March 1973, when Richard Nixon was president.
The Labor Department further reported that 2.07 million Americans are collecting unemployment insurance, down more than 7 percent from a year ago.
The Labor Department considers the U.S. job market to be solid, with employers adding a healthy 227,000 jobs in January, pushing the unemployment rate to 4.8 percent, close to what economists consider full employment.
On Feb. 28, 2017, Fox News reported there was a significant drop in illegal immigration across the southwest border during President Trump's first month in office compared to that of the last three months of the Obama presidency, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB).
In January 2017, 31,575 individuals were taken into custody between ports of entry on the southwest border, compared with an average of more than 45,000 for each of the previous three months, according to the CPB.
In an effort to detail President Trump's major accomplishments, Infowars.com surveyed the White House press releases since the Inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017, coming up with a detailed list, focusing on Executive Orders and legislation signed since President Trump became president.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) has disavowed views put forward in their book Fed Up!: Our Fight to Save America from Washington just one week into their presidential campaign and only 9 months after it was first published in November 2010.
In the book, Perry blasted the expansion of the federal government and criticized programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. They attacked social welfare programs as “fraudulent systems designed to take in a lot of money at the front and pay out none in the end.”
Perry also called Social Security “a crumbling monument to the failure of the New Deal,” which was implemented “at the expense of respect for the Constitution.”
But their communications director, Ray Sullivan, recently told the Wall Street Journal that the book is not meant to reflect the governor's current views on Social Security, describing the book as “a look back, not a path forward.” They added that the book was “not in any way as a 2012 campaign blueprint or manifesto.”
Perry now wants Social Security benefits for existing retirees and those close to retirement to be strongly protected, according to Sullivan, but the governor also seeks to reform the program to insure it is fiscally responsible.
Landsverk L-120 was a light tank designed in Sweden. One tank and one tank chassis was ordered for tests by the Swedish Army in 1936, and one chassis was ordered by the Norwegian Army the same year. The chassis sold to Norway became Norway's first ever tank, after an improvised turret and makeshift armour had been added.
Swedish service [ edit ]
In October 1936 the Swedish Army placed an order with the armoured fighting vehicle manufacturer AB Landsverk in the Scanian city of Landskrona for one L-120 tank and one L-120 tank chassis for testing purposes. In April the following year an order for a tank turret followed.[1] The tank chassis was delivered to the Swedish Army in May 1937, and the tank in July–August the same year. In July 1937, just some two months after it was delivered, the tank chassis was bought back by AB Landsverk in connection with a large order for Landsverk L-60 light tanks being made by the Swedish government from AB Landsverk. The repurchased tank chassis was then probably used to fulfil an order from Norway.[1]
"Rikstanken" taking part in military winter exercises in Norway
Concurrently with the Swedish order Landsverk also received an order from Norway for a tank chassis, with delivery set at March 1937. The cost of the purchase was SEK 30,000, around the equivalent of US$3,000. After delivery delays the tank chassis was handed over to Norway.[1] The chassis was equipped after arrival with an improvised turret and ordinary iron plates for armour and was armed with a Colt M/29 heavy machine gun, making it Norway's first ever tank.[1][2][3] The tank was quickly dubbed "Rikstanken" (English: The National Tank) by the Norwegians.[1] Other nicknames were "Kongstanken" (English: The Royal Tank) and "Norgestanken" (English: The Norway Tank).[2][3] The name "Norgestanken" was a humorous invention,[2] playing on the fact that the word tanken in Norwegian means both "the tank" and "the thought", making it a pun. The noun "Norgestanken" (English: the Norway thought) was an old nationalistic term for the idea of an independent Norway.[4] Kongstanken, as in "the royal thought", signifies a grand and bold thought or an idealistic idea.[5]
"The field exercise at Jæren in 1938 was a horror of primitive matériel . There was next to nothing of signals, communications and sapper matériel, nor were there any motorized units, except the only terror of the exercise, the old tank that shook, functioned and failed, all on its own discretion... A depressing lack of matériel compared to a wonderful human material. " —Eyewitness Rob. Jo. (Robert Johnsen) from Stavanger.[6]
The purchase of the tank by the Norwegian government happened on the background of the increased tension in Europe preceding the Second World War. The threatening situation convinced the Norwegian government to budget 20,000 kr for the purchase of a tank for the Norwegian Army. As the shipping costs of the complete tank would be too expensive, only the chassis was imported. As adding the original steel armour would cost another NOK 50,000, iron plates were used instead.[2] In addition, the steering levers were replaced with a steering wheel. The engine of the tank proved unreliable and at best gave a top speed of 25 kilometres per hour (16 mph).[2] The brakes were also found to be too weak, with the tank once ending up crashed against a tree during a field exercise in Trøndelag.[7]
Together with an experimental platoon of locally manufactured armoured cars Rikstanken formed the Norwegian cavalry's armoured force. Rikstanken and the three armoured cars took part in all the Norwegian Army's exercises in 1938 and 1939. The armoured vehicles moved around to the different dragoon regiments of the Norwegian Army.[1][7]
In the January 1938 lecture "Panservogner for opklaring og marsjsikring i Norge" (Armoured vehicles for reconnaissance and protection during the march in Norway) at the officers' society Oslo Militære Samfund,[8] Colonel Christopher Fougner pointed out that the single tank in the Norwegian armoury was completely insufficient to train the country's soldiers in anti-armour warfare. Colonel Fougner warned that if more tanks and other armoured vehicles were not expressly acquired, then the first tank most Norwegian soldiers would see would belong to an attacking enemy army.[9]
On 9 April 1940, when the Germans invaded Norway, the tank and the three armoured cars were stored in the depot of Dragoon Regiment 1 at Gardermoen.[10] When Dragoon Regiment 1 finished its mobilization at 03:00 on 10 April and moved out to oppose the invading German forces they left both the tank and the armoured cars behind.[11] The tank and the armoured cars were captured by the advancing Germans and disappeared from records,[1] after having been a popular object for souvenir photos for German troops at Gardermoen in May 1940.[12]

At this point in their career Janet Pelley could probably write a book about financial challenges at libraries.
"They'd just come out of a funding crisis when I joined this library in 1976."
Much has changed between then and now but Pelley, the director of the Colchester-East Hants Public Library system, still finds themselves dealing with funding limitations even as she's months away from retirement.

Libraries across the province are facing the grim reality that without more help very soon, many of them will be faced with difficult decisions. For some time now, the province has budgeted $14.4 million for libraries.
Denise Corey, chief librarian for Cumberland Public Libraries, said in the past 12 years they've had a 1.3 per cent increase in funding.
"And I don't mean 1.3 per cent a year, I mean 1.3 per cent," they said. "What we do is we just keep cutting in the background, because we don't want to affect our patrons."
Denise Corey, chief librarian for Cumberland Public Libraries, says libraries need a long-term sustainable funding model. (CBC)
They held off as a long as possible from going public about their struggles, not wanting to worry the public, but Corey said they've reached a breaking point.
Most libraries get about 75 per cent of their funding from the province. They must raise three per cent of their operating budget themselves and the balance comes from local municipalities. Fundraising is as much a part of the job now as overseeing programs.
"The budget that we're putting out is really nickle and dimeing," said Corey. "All staff put their bottles in one box and we take it to the recycling and we put that money back in the library."
'Walking on a tightrope'
Corey, Pelley and the rest of their colleagues around the province are holding out hope that help might be on the way. A committee made up of representatives from municipalities, libraries and the province's Communities, Culture and Heritage Department is meeting to discuss core library services and the future.
Warden Jimmy MacAlpine of the Municipality of the District of Digby sits on the committee. It's their hope the work will help convince the province to increase funding.
"A lot of them are walking on a tightrope in a lot of ways with their funding," they said. "[Libraries] do so much more than just provide books and that's the message we're trying to drive home."
Finding a quiet place to sit at the library in Truro. (CBC)
Troy Myers, chief librarian for South Shore Public Libraries, hopes the government is able to see the way libraries have evolved through the years, providing literacy services, programs for immigrants and whatever else a given community might need.
"I'm just hoping the province really does understand that public libraries are fundamental to the health of a community," they said.
"I can't think of any place other than a public library that really welcomes everybody without prejudice."
Corey and Pelley have likewise watched as their branches have morphed into community focal points where kids can come to play, internet access is guaranteed, seniors can get technology instruction or people can simply have a safe, warm and friendly place to spend the day.
Even at the Truro library, which opened recently and is seeing lots of demand, the current funding structure makes it challenging to have enough staff. (CBC)
They're all seeing increased patronage, but more people create more demand and that demand needs more money. Even in Truro, where the town recently opened a new library that would be the envy of any town, Pelley finds themselves wishing they had more staff and more money to pay them.
"We're really just in a place where we need to be supported," said Corey.
"A community hub is not as common as it used to be. There used to be places where people could go and gather and now I think that that has become the library."
MacApline said the committee hopes to have a report ready to present to the government this spring, ahead of the provincial budget. The Communities, Culture and Heritage Department would not make anyone available for an interview.
A Ukrainian prankster is facing five years in prison for ambushing a Eurovision performer on stage and exposing their backside.  They are also notorious for failed attempts to kiss Kim Kardashian and Will Smith.
Vitaly Sediuk, who mooned crowds at the Eurovision song context while wearing an Australian flag, is now facing a fine or a five-year prison term.
“He was detained for 72 hours, until the court comes up with a sentence – a fine or up to five years in jail,” Arsen Avakov, Ukraine's interior minister, wrote on Facebook.
“Now, this shame of our country can practice their hobby while in police custody,” they added.

Earlier, Sediuk had stormed the stage of the contest in Kiev, circling 2016 Eurovision winner Jamala, who was performing a half-time show. A moment later, they dropped their pants and exposed their buttocks to the public.
Last year, Sediuk famously ambushed Kim Kardashian in Paris. As the celebrity was stepping out of their car, the prankster assaulted their backside, apparently trying to kiss it.
The ambusher was caught on camera before being taken away by Kardashian's security detail.
A week earlier, Mr. Sediuk had approached Hadid during Milan Fashion Week and attempted to lift them off the ground.
At the 2013 Grammy Awards, Sediuk stormed the stage and accepted the prize on Adele's behalf.
A year earlier, the Ukrainian approached Will Smith, who was heading for an autograph session in Moscow. After telling the Men in Black star they were a big fan, the prankster tried to kiss him. The celebrity then slapped the Ukrainian in the face, saying, “That's your problem, buddy.”
Ironically, Twitter users reacted to the Eurovision stunt as if Sediuk was an Australian fan, with one Eurovision commentator saying, “Get off the stage, Australia.”
Other users viewed it as the best and funniest part of the song contest.
“Even if #Britain wins, we'll still come 2nd to an #Australian arse,” wrote a user named Jennifer Cox.
Others thought they should have sung the ‘Blue Moon', a famous ballad that has been performed by Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, and Elvis Presley.

Rebel forces in the Central African Republic say they have halted their offensive on the capital, Bangui, and will take part in peace talks.
The announcement from the Seleka rebels comes as the country's neighbours say they are sending in extra troops.
Gabon deployed 120 troops on Tuesday and Cameroon was expected to send a similar number.
The CAR's President, Francois Bozize, has sacked the defence minister - who is their son - and the army chief.
The dismissal of Francis Bozize and Gen Guillaume Lapo was announced on state radio. No reason was given but the president has criticised the army for failing to stop the rebels.
President Bozize has taken over as defence minister, officials said.
If the rebels attack Damara that would amount to a declaration of war Jean-Felix Akaga, Regional force commander
Since the Seleka rebels began their campaign a month ago, they have taken several key towns and cities, including the diamond centre of Bria.
On Saturday, they captured Sibut city, which is about 150km (95 miles) from the capital, Bangui, after government forces withdrew.
It is the biggest threat President Bozize has faced since they took power in a coup in 2003.
Both the US and France, the former colonial power, have rejected a plea by the government for help to defeat the rebels.
However, neighbouring states agreed to bolster the Central African Multinational Force (Fomac), which was deployed to the CAR in 2008 to help end years of unrest.
'Fled to the bush'
Speaking to BBC Afrique before news of their dismissal, Francis Bozize said Fomac troops had been deployed to Damara, 75km (48 miles) from the capital.
Fomac commander General Jean-Felix Akaga warned the rebels against any attempt to take Damara, the last strategic town between them and Bangui, AFP news agency reports.
"We will not give up Damara," they were quoted as saying.
Damara resident Bertin Andjipassera told Reuters news agency that people have been fleeing their homes.
"Everybody in Damara has gone into the bush, even our wives, our children are in the bush... The hospitals are not working.... There's nothing, just suffering."
Francis Bozize said 120 Gabonese soldiers had arrived in the CAR on Tuesday to bolster the regional force.
A similar number of troops from Cameroon were expected on Wednesday, and they would be followed by a contingent from Congo-Brazzaville, they added.
BBC West Africa correspondent Thomas Fessy says the rebels' capacity to take on these reinforcements is not known and the regional military build-up may well have worked as a deterrent.
Last month, France sent more than 100 paratroopers but insisted they were only there to secure its nationals - not to save the government.
Seleka spokesperson Eric Massi told journalists the rebels had been ordered to halt their advance.
"I have asked our forces not to move their positions starting today because we want to enter talks in [Gabon's capital] Libreville for a political solution," they told Reuters on Wednesday.
"I am in discussion with our partners to come up with proposals to end the crisis, but one solution could be a political transition that excludes [President] Bozize."
A regional body, the Economic Community of Central African States (Eccas), is trying to arrange talks between the government and rebels in Libreville, while strengthening its force in the CAR.
Seleka - an alliance of three separate groups - accuses the government of failing to honour a 2007 peace deal under which fighters who laid down their arms were meant to be paid.
They have dismissed the president's offer to form a national unity government.

Let's Google Google! Not so Popular Facts about The Search Engine
Image Source: Pexels.com
Can you imagine your life without Google? Perhaps you can, perhaps you can't. And perhaps it depends on whether you were born before or after Google was introduced to the world. Nonetheless, the truth is we use the search monopolist (and its products) without giving it a second thought.
Why? Because Google helps us in our work whenever we want to learn quickly how to do something; because Google assists us in our daily lives when we plan our next vacation or when we need to know how to get somewhere.
(There's a reason) We use Google whenever we need to acquire information quickly and adeptly.
We are so used to the search giant that we ‘google' everything instead of looking it up online (it's the same thing, eh?) or doing it the old-fashioned way by visiting the local library. Google is our library. Google is a synonym to ‘search' and one of the most popular modern verbs, already included in dictionaries.
Image Source: http://www.merriam-webster.com
The statistics prove it. As of March 2016, Google has the largest desktop market share with 67.78% (data by NetMarketShare.com), followed by Bing, Baidu, Yahoo, AOL.
Remember when we decided to check how much Google knew about us, its dedicated users? Now it's time to see how much we know about Google. We are googling Google, figuratively speaking. It goes without saying that there are lots of curious facts to explore. However, some are more outstanding than others, and those are the facts that outline the future of humankind.
We are giving you some known and other lesser known facts about the Internet giant to prove we need to ask more questions, instead of taking everything for granted.
What are the prospects of learning more about Google?
1) You get a clue of where technology is headed;
2) You deserve the right to be titled a ‘know-all';
3) Next time you are not feeling a conversation, you can quickly change the subject to “Did you know that Googlе…?”.
If you're not satisfied with those options, remember that Google has been around for almost 20 years. Aren't you just a tad curious of what has happened during that lengthy period? You are, aren't you? Let's proceed.
Curious Facts from 's Past
Google's Origin
(You probably know this, but consistency requires us to start from the beginning). Google started out as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin (the founders of Google) in 1996, and was originally named BackRub. Page and Brin were both Ph.D. students at Stanford University and were delving into the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, analyzing its link structure as a huge graph. They were also friends.

We won't go deeper into details about the birth of Google (for more details, go to Wikipedia's page). But it is worth mentioning that the search engine initially used Stanford's website with the domain google.stanford.edu. The domain google.com was registered on September 15, 1997.
Google's First Office (and How It Leads to a Successful Career)
The first company office was a garage in Menlo Park, California, owned by Susan Wojcicki. Susan Wojcicki is the current CEO of YouTube. They were also senior vice president of Advertising & Commerce, and has worked on Google Ads, AdSense, DoubleClick and Google Analytics. Actually, AdSense was developed by Susan Wojcicki. Susan has 5 kids. Impressive, isn't it?
Google's PageRank
Google's co-founder Larry Page invented PageRank together with Brin. PageRank is Google's search ranking algorithm. PageRank is actually named after Larry Page, not because it has something to do with web pages. Or perhaps it's one of those great coincidences!
Here's how PageRank works, in Google's own words:
PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.
Why “Google”?
Do you know what a googol is? 1 googol =1.0 × 10100. A googol is the large number 10100. The term was invented in 1920 by a nine-year-old, Milton Sirotta, nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner.
When Larry Page and Sergey Brin were looking for a name for their project (BackRub wouldn't do the job, obviously), they came up with the idea to use googol. They believed that googol illustrated the intention of the search engine to provide large quantities of information. However, they misspelled it while checking if such a domain already existed.
The Kasner family considered suing Google for using the googol term in 2004. However, a lawsuit was never filed.
That Time When Excite Refused to Buy Google
Excite, one of Internet's original portals, once refused to acquire Google for less than a million dollars. The story was quite popular among IT folks few years ago but there's a good chance you missed it.
Here's what happened. In 1999, Brin and Page were looking to sell Google, because the project was taking up much of their time. As the story goes, the two of them arranged a meeting with George Bell, CEO of Excite at that time, and made them an offer of a million dollars. However, Bell rejected the offer. Actually, they rejected them twice. The sum was later decreased to $750,000 but Bell didn't agree to it. We bet he's regretting their decision now, while Brin and Page are happy they couldn't sell!

Meanwhile, Excite became Ask.com, as it was acquired by Ask Jeeves in 2004. To be more precise, Excite's portal and services are owned by Excite Networks. However, in the USA, Excite is a personal portal, named My Excite, controlled by Mindspark and owned by IAC Search and Media. If Mindspark sounds familiar to you, it is most likely because you have been struggling to remove a Mindspark-associated unwanted home or search page from your browser.

Curious Facts about 's Present
Google's Death Benefits
In August 2012, a story appeared on Forbes, revealing Google's most peculiar and astounding policy towards the death of their employees, oddly but accurately referred to as ‘death benefits'.
Here's what author Meghan Casserly found out in an interview with Chief People Officer Laszlo Bock:
Should a U.S. Googler pass away while under the employ of the 14-year old search giant, their surviving spouse or domestic partner will receive a check for 50% of their salary every year for the next decade. Even more surprising, a Google spokesperson confirms that there's “no tenure requirement” for this benefit, meaning most of their 34 thousand Google employees qualify.
Further in the conversation, Bock explains that struggling with the death of your partners is never an easy task. That is why Google as a company has made it their mission to do their best to help the surviving spouse. In addition to the 10-year pay package, the surviving spouse will have their stocks entrusted immediately and any children will receive a monthly payment in the size of $1,000 until the age of 19, or 23 in case the child is a full-time student.
The death benefits policy was embraced by Google in 2011.
Google's Acquisition Policy
In April 16, 2015, Google had acquired more than 180 companies, its largest acquisition being the acquisition of Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion. Interestingly, most of the companies bought by Google are based in the United States, in or around the San Francisco Bay Area (via Wikipedia).
This means that Google has been acquiring approximately one company per week since 2010.
Google and Real-Time (Car) Traffic Tracking
We all know that Google (among other online services) collects sensitive information about its users. Data collection is a double-edged knife, to say the least. However, it can have a positive outcome. Did you know that, thanks to Android devices, Google Maps can show you the intensity of traffic in your area? Go to Google's Support Page for more details. Or just:
Open the Google Maps app.
Touch the menu in the top left corner.
Select Traffic.
In other words, the traffic flow visible on your map is a precise real-time display of the exact number of Android phones currently passing through the same route.
Curious Facts about ‘s Future (And Our Own)
Google's Mission and Google Books Project
Did you know that Google has made it their mission “to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful”? Gathering all the world's books at one (online) location is the perfect way to put their mission into motion.
According to Leonid Taycher, one of the software engineers working on Google Books, in 2010, there were exactly 129,864,880 books in the world. To count and digitalize all books available in the world, Google engineers have written programs that go through 150 catalogues and directories such as the International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN). The programs also serve to eliminate as many duplicate entries as possible.
As of June 2010, Google has scanned 12 million books, written in about 480 languages. Roughly estimated, Google plans to complete the scanning within a decade, which means that by 2020 the humankind will have a full virtual collection of four billion pages and two trillion words. Amazing, right?
Google's Lunar Xprize
Have you heard of Google's highly anticipated and ambitious Lunar Xprize project?
Created in 2007, the mission of the Google Lunar XPRIZE is to incentivize space entrepreneurs to create a new era of affordable access to the Moon and beyond. The competition's $30 million prize purse will be awarded to teams who are able to land a privately funded rover on the moon, travel 500 meters, and transmit back high definition video and images.
If this impressed you, just imagine that “it takes about the same amount of computing to answer one Google Search query as all the computing done — in flight and on the ground — for the entire Apollo program!”
Google definitely loves science, as it also hosts a Global Science Fair – an international online competition open to individuals or teams from 13 to 18 years old.

After all the knowledge your mind just swallowed in and is probably still digesting, you're most likely craving for some interaction. With Google. Just go to google.com and type in ‘askew'! Otherwise, check the traffic and if it's okay, go out and explore the offline world. It's as amusing as exploring it via Google Earth!

Saudi Arabia and Turkey have agreed to form a Strategic Cooperation Council to coordinate and develop relations between the countries in terms of economic, political, defense, security, education and health issues. The countries also are discussing military cooperation, especially with regard to Syria.
The custodian of the two holy mosques, Saudi King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, received Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu at their palace in Riyadh during the prime minister's official visit Jan. 31.
The high-level Turkish delegation Davutoglu headed included Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Economy Minister Mustafa Elitas, Interior Minister Efkan Ala, Defense Minister Ismet Yilmaz, Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication Minister Binali Yildirim and the chief of the General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces, Gen. Hulusi Akar.
Following the meeting between the Saudi king and Davutoglu, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir and their Turkish counterpart announced that officials had agreed to implement the Strategic Cooperation Council.
“We will sign [the agreement] in the future and appoint two joint presidents for the council,” Jubeir said. The meeting followed up on discussions in December, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan visited Saudi Arabia.
The final signing of the council agreement is scheduled during Salman's visit to Turkey to participate in the Islamic summit, which is held every three years. The summit's 13th session will be held in Istanbul from April 10-15 under the auspices of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which was established in September 1969 and includes 57 member states on four continents.
The royal palace in Riyadh welcomed Davutoglu with a luncheon by Salman in the presence of senior Saudi officials, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. The crown prince had visited Ankara in April 2015 a few hours before Erdoğan's visit to Iran, so as to brief Erdoğan on Tehran's security interventions in the Gulf and military interference in Yemen.
The lunch also included the Saudi defense minister and chairperson of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later held a meeting with Davutoglu, given that the deputy crown prince is responsible for the military and economic affairs in Saudi Arabia.
These developments reflect the interest of Saudi Arabia in establishing a strategic partnership with Turkey, which has shown the initiative to achieve a greater understanding with Riyadh on several political issues with regard to Yemen and Syria. Turkey also agreed to join the military anti-terrorism Islamic coalition declared by the Saudi minister of defense in December.
Conversely, the government of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi did not offer the support Riyadh sought in several political and military stances with regard to Syria, Yemen or Iraq; observers said this reflects Egypt's ingratitude for the kingdom's support of the Egyptian economy in terms of funds and oil. Saudi Arabia provided more than $8 billion worth of aid to Egypt in 2013 and 2014.
It seems that the Turks are more willing and able — albeit not by receiving any direct financial aid from Saudi Arabia — to show solidarity with the Saudis, starting with Erdoğan, who made a scathing criticism of Iran, accusing it of executing a large number of people, during their speech in January against the backdrop of the attacks on the Saudi Embassy in Tehran. Erdoğan previously accused Iran of seeking to dominate the region in an interview with France 24 in March 2015, declaring their support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.
This is not to mention Davutoglu's criticism of Iran's behavior with its Arab neighbors during their interview with Al-Arabiya channel Feb. 3, although they described Iran as a friendly and neighboring country to avoid raising Tehran's ire; there is $14 billion in trade between Turkey and Iran.
Moreover, the Turkish Foreign Ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador to Ankara on Jan. 7 to protest Iranian media outlets that had linked Erdoğan's recent visit to Saudi Arabia and Riyadh's death sentence against Shiite Saudi cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr. This is not to mention the Iranian media accusing Erdoğan of previously being aware of Riyadh's decision and of coordinating with Saudi authorities to implement the death sentence against Nimr. These accusations came in response to Erdoğan's statements that the death sentence is a Saudi internal affair.
During their visit to Riyadh, Davutoglu, during their meetings with a number of Saudi business people, was keen to persuade them to increase the size of their investments in Turkey.
Turkey seeks, through its new cooperation with Riyadh, to increase Saudi investment in Turkey, which currently amounts to about $2 billion — namely in real estate and other activities such as industry, tourism and energy — to $25 billion by 2023.
Ankara also seeks to obtain a bigger share of development projects in Saudi Arabia to the benefit of 200 Turkish companies operating in the field of construction and contracting, whose investments reached $1 billion during 2015.
According to a report by Al-Hayat newspaper Jan. 11 quoting sources from the Saudi Ministry of Housing and Turkish sources, a group of Turkish companies would land contracts with the Saudi Housing Ministry for the construction of residential units with an area of 300 million square meters (3.2 billion square feet); while the value was not confirmed, there were reports that it could be as much as $240 billion.
Turkey is characterized by its strategic location linking Europe and Asia and its growing and diversified economy under the rule of the Islamic Justice and Development Party (AKP). The AKP has implemented an economic program designed to reduce imports, focusing on producing and exporting local products based on local raw materials and establishing international business partnerships with Europe and oil-rich countries in the Middle East.
This is not to mention Turkey's military power, as it has the second-largest army in NATO with 670,000 soldiers, following that of the United States.
Saudi Arabia is anxiously looking at Iran's growing power and influence in the Arab region following the relief of international sanctions by Europe, the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency, not to mention lifting the ban on its oil exports, which allowed it to restore half of its frozen assets abroad, amounting to $100 billion.
In this context, Riyadh is turning toward Sunni-dominated Ankara, considering that the close economic, security and military ties have become a strategic need to protect the security of the Gulf and reduce the risk of Iranian influence in the smoldering Arab areas such as Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
Despite the expected benefits on the political and military levels after the cooperation agreement is enacted, and despite the AKP's positive stance and support of Saudi Arabia and its genuine endeavor to promote cooperation between the two countries, Saudis who are banking on any foreign military and economic alliances should be realistic and cautious in their optimism.
This is especially true since the Turkish government might be powerful and capable inside Turkey, but is not very likely to demonstrate the same influence and power abroad as the Saudis wish — given Turkey's economic considerations with Iran, and for military reasons, as it is a member of NATO, not to mention the security reasons in light of the battle with armed Kurdish groups at home.
Decision-makers in Riyadh first ought to trust their citizens and enlist those who are willing in the army to increase the armed forces, currently amounting to 233,000 soldiers. However, this number is no longer sufficient for Riyadh, which is currently engaged in different military operations in Yemen and Bahrain, and potentially in Syria and other countries.
Saudi Arabia also ought to take necessary measures in this regard so it will not have to seek help from abroad, especially with 651,000 unemployed people in the kingdom, according to 2014 official statistics. The kingdom also needs a national project to face the Iranian one, as no economic reform can be achieved without real political reforms ensuring the participation of citizens in power and wealth management.
The original soundtrack of the game by Danny Baranowsky can be bought on the Bandcamp page. For more information on the original soundtrack refer to the game's Wikipedia entry.
Included in the game are two alternate soundtracks: an EDM cover of the original by A_Rival, which by default plays for Melody, and a metal cover of the original by FamilyJules7x, which by default plays for Aria. Through the options menu, the player can choose for each character which of the soundtracks to use, or to have a version chosen at random for each level.
Two more soundtracks were added to the game on 1 May 2016: a MIDI version done by Jake "virt" Kaufman and a 80s new wave synth version done by Girlfriend Records.
A fifth soundtrack, created by OverClocked Remix, was added to the game with the release of the Amplified DLC.
A sixth soundtrack, created by Chipzel was released January 31st 2017, it will make it's debut on Xbox One.
All versions of each song have the same duration and BPM. The only difference is the style; there is no mechanical difference. A few of the boss tracks (Death Metal, Deep Blues, and King Conga in particular) vary in length across the different soundtracks, but since these tracks loop, there are no advantages to using one OST over another.
There is one more official soundtrack which is a crossover with Danganronpa It was made by Spike Chunsoft, which developed Danganronpa and published the localized-for-Japan version of NecroDancer. It was released alongside the Chipzel pack on PC August 22 2017.
Similarly, the Switch port of the game also includes an exclusive Groove Coaster soundtrack, a dubstep soundtrack that fits the music style in Groove Coaster series, a rhythm game series on arcade and mobile that's a spinoff of Space Invader.

Trivia Edit
It was revealed by Jake Kaufman that if you layer their version of the soundtrack over Danny B's, they perfectly align and become a larger scale track. It was later confirmed by Chipzel that their soundtrack had a similar purpose.
The Wight to Remain is actually a revamped track of the (scrapped) Zone 1 - Level 4 theme from the game's alpha. The original can be found here.
Dead End is an unedited track from the game's alpha, the Zone 2 - Level 2 theme. The reason the theme was unused for the level was because it was considered too long to use, and too varied in composition to cut.

Back in March, days after becoming Taoiseach, Enda Kenny made a massive blunder at their first European Council meeting in Brussels. A blunder that will cost the Irish taxpayer many millions.
Back in March, days after becoming Taoiseach, Enda Kenny made a massive blunder at their first European Council meeting in Brussels. A blunder that will cost the Irish taxpayer many millions.
After three weeks of seeking clarity on this issue, it has been confirmed to me this weekend that at that meeting, a "cocky" Kenny missed a golden opportunity to return home with the much-talked-about interest rate reduction on our bailout package.
At that meeting, the Taoiseach made a plea for fairness in relation to Ireland's case, and that we deserved a rate reduction.
Indeed, other eurozone leaders agreed to a reduction to match those of the IMF. But Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy insisted Ireland should not get a discount without making a concession: their price, an increase in Ireland's 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate.
Mr Kenny, who, according to Channel 4 reporter Faisal Islam made a "terrible impact" at the meeting, refused to budge on the issue. So, the summit ended with Greece receiving a one per cent interest rate cut, while Ireland got nothing.
Despite coming away empty handed, Mr Kenny came home something of a hero for standing up for Ireland.
But that was not the full story. Confirmed to me in recent days, Mr Kenny was offered an opportunity to secure the rate reduction without having to concede on the corporation tax rate.
A spokesperson for Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council who chaired the meeting, confirmed to me Ireland was offered a way out, which the Taoiseach either refused to take or didn't fully grasp.
It has been confirmed that Mr Kenny was not asked to move either on the tax rate or tax base; they only had to promise "constructive engagement on tax co-ordination".
Kenny was being offered a tangible gain in return for an intangible promise.
Had the Irish leader signed up to such a weak commitment, they could have brought home a reduction in Ireland's interest rate and the preservation of our corporate tax rate.
Mr Van Rompuy's spokesperson also said that they were "surprised" that Mr Kenny did not accept the offer.
So why did they not take it?
It now appears Kenny was so determined to appear tough on corporation tax that they were blinded to the pragmatic offer on the table.
During the heave against Kenny last year, Leo Varadkar said on Prime Time that if
a sovereign debt crisis arose and Patrick Honohan picked up the phone to the Taoiseach at 3am, they didn't want Enda Kenny at the end of that phone.
What they meant was that they felt Mr Kenny was not smart enough, economically literate enough or politically savvy enough to occupy the top job.
In the absence of the wily Michael Noonan beside them in Brussels in March, that council meeting was Mr Kenny's 3am call and, as Varadkar predicted, they blew it.
For their part, Mr Kenny went out with a game plan and that was that.
"The Government was determined to give a clear and unambiguous signal that Ireland's 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate was essential to its economic recovery. A movement was sought on the issue, and we refused to move on it," Mr Kenny's spokesperson said to me last week.
Three months later, Ireland has still not obtained the rate reduction, and as we now know, any reduction will not be back dated but will only apply from here on in. So, the failure of Mr Kenny to secure the rate reduction in March has been and will be extremely costly.
Since then, Ireland has been running to stand still, simply to make up the ground lost by Mr Kenny.
Van Rompuy paid a visit to Dublin three weeks ago, and raised the issue of Ireland's corporation tax when they met Mr Kenny in their office. So there is no doubt that some deal is being worked upon to get everybody off a hook created by Mr Kenny's blunder.
But that pragmatic offer on the table in March is no longer on offer. The French and the Germans are likely to demand more than "constructive engagement".
It seems more likely that the cost will be a concession by Ireland on the harmonisation of the corporation tax base -- or no cut in the ruinous rate. In a worrying statement, Mr Noonan made a crucial intervention two weeks ago when they said they would be willing to sacrifice the rate reduction to protect Ireland's corporation tax rate.
The significance of Mr Kenny's failure to secure that rate reduction was brought once again into sharp focus by the revelation by Mr Noonan that our abusive "external partners" would profit to the tune of €9bn from our rescue deal over its lifetime.
That's €9bn that would otherwise go on hospitals like Roscommon, schools and other public services, but instead will be handed over to our foreign overlords.
That it equates to about one third of our total annual tax take has also led a number of people to once again say that Ireland's rocketing debt mountain is unsustainable and that a default of some sort is inevitable.
I agree. Ireland will and must default, but that default must only be on debts relating to our banks. There can be no question of us reneging on our sovereign debt.
It is criminal to ask the people of this country to pick up the tab for the crimes of bankers in Ireland who have not yet been brought to justice, and the greed of bankers in France and Germany.
Like Constantin Guerdiev, the economist and deficit hawk (as they describe himself), I believe Ireland can only consider a default once we have tackled our budget deficit. And that means real and unprecedented reform of the public sector, which is not fit for purpose in its present state.
Overall, Irish public sector workers by European standards are massively overpaid and underworked and we can no longer afford such lunacy. The Government's attack on civil service fat cats like Declan Collier and Padraig McManus is welcome but doesn't go far enough.
With the IMF/ECB team back in town ensuring we stick to our side of the plan, Brendan Howlin's 'Comprehensive Review' is a golden opportunity to knock some shape into our deeply dysfunctional public sector, and they have to get it right.
A new paper by Guerdiev shows that despite accumulated cuts of €20.5bn since 2008 in current spending, our deficit has remained at €18bn, primarily due to increased social welfare payments.
As a result, there has been no tangible reduction in the gap between government spending and revenue. We have all taken great pain but in reality we are no better off, in terms of our deficit, than we were two years ago.
According to Guerdiev, in the first half of 2011, government spending was at €21.8bn, just €804m less than what we spent in 2008, and that is after three austerity budgets. That is why Mr Noonan finally acknowledged last week that the cuts in December's budget would have to be higher than the €3.6bn previously stated.
This weekend, in the wake of the Portuguese downgrade and the continued crisis surrounding Greece, the cost of borrowing to Ireland for 10 years soared to about 13 per cent, three times the accepted rate.
As a result, the chances of Ireland returning to the markets next year are as unlikely as they have ever been, increasing the expectations of an Irish default. While such an event will not be pretty, it is without question inevitable.
Sunday Independent
As a mother of young children, Fadumo Sheikh is used to rising early. Last Saturday they were due to prepare their breakfasts before they went to the local madrasa. But the day started earlier than ever when, at around 2am, they were woken by the sound of sporadic gunfire.
Within sight of Sheikh's home in Barawe, Somalia, crack American navy Seals had launched a lightning amphibious assault on the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab. Less an hour later they would be forced to retreat, their mission far from accomplished. Based on interviews with witnesses and members of al-Shabaab, as well as official statements and media reports, the Guardian can present the most comprehensive picture yet of the daring pre-dawn raid – and where it went wrong.
The Americans' target was an innocuous two-storey beachside house in Barawe, a fishing town of about 200,000 people that was a crucial slave trade port in the colonial era. In particular, they had planned the delicate operation of capturing, not killing, Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdulkadir, a Kenyan of Somali origin and senior commander of al-Shabaab who was linked to a number of terrorist plots.
The house, about 200 metres from the sea on the town's east side, is understood to be used by foreign extremists who have gone to Somalia to take up al-Shabaab's cause. The group's presence there was not news to Sheikh.
"I live in a house near the beach and I used to see the house every day. There were so many al-Shabaab fighters entering and coming out," they said. "I usually see them going back and forth but I had never thought that so important a person was living inside the house."
Early morning gunfire was unusual, Sheikh continued, except when al-Shabaab was conducting training exercises. "I raised my ears and I continued to hear the gunfire growing. I had no feeling or thought of such an attack from the Americans. I looked at my watch about 30 minutes later and heard one explosion and then, a few minutes later, another explosion occurred, like boom!"
What had been invisible to Sheikh and other residents of Barawe was the stealthy advance of navy Seal team six – the same unit that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan – in a speedboat towards the Somalian coastline before first light. The team consisted of about 20 Seals, according to leaked accounts, and their craft was flanked on the Indian Ocean by three small boats to provide back-up.
'They looked like three big cows'
The Seals swept ashore, but not everyone in Barawe was asleep in those chilly early morning hours. Abdurahman Yarow, a longtime resident of the town, recalled: "I was wrapping my turban on my neck and head to protect against the cold and heading to the mosque. When I had nearly entered it, I heard a sound behind me. I saw what looked like three big cows going towards the north of the mosque – it was dark so I could not identify well what they were.
"After only 10 minutes I heard the first guns – that is, when the gun battle occurred between al-Shabaab fighters in the house and the US forces. I now understand the big cows I saw in the night were the American special forces with their military bags on their backs going in the direction of the house they targeted."
The Seals took up positions inside the house's compound, according to a report by NBC, which continued: "Then a lone al-Shabaab fighter walked out into plain view, smoked a cigarette, and went back inside, one source familiar with the details of the raid said. The fighter played it cool, and gave no indication that they had spotted the Seals. But they came back out shooting, firing rounds from an AK-47 assault rifle."
The element of surprise had been lost and al-Shabaab's fighters unleashed gunfire and grenades in a cacophony that rang out across the town, murdering sleep before dawn prayers. But the Americans continued on the offensive, according to an elder who did not wish to be named. "The attackers from the US divided into two groups," they said. "Group one, comprising six men, stormed the house and began shooting the people inside it, while group two, also of at least six men, were staying outside the house. The worst shooting took place inside where one al-Shabaab fighter was killed. Al-Shabaab had more fighters inside and they fought extremely hard against the Americans."
The elder continued: "The Americans tried to enter room by room into the house to start searching for the big fish but al-Shabaab got reinforcing fighters from other houses and then the situation deteriorated until the Americans retreated."
According to the NBC account, several Seals could see Abdulkadir through windows but they were heavily protected; according to al-Shabaab, they were not in the building. While Pentagon officials have been reluctant to provide a full narrative, they have said US forces retreated from the gun battle out of a concern for potential civilian casualties. Details leaked to the press suggest that the compound contained far more women and children than the Seals expected.
The commandos returned to their boat, grateful for having suffered no casualties, and finally there was calm. Sheikh recalled: "At 3am the call for prayer started, and all the gunfire stopped. A neighbour called me on the phone and said there is an attack against the mujahideen. When it became safe enough to see everything outside, I came out to look around. Outside the house which came under attack there were some fighters of al-Shabaab and some residents come to witness the incident.

"These al-Shabaab fighters were not talking to the people. Some of them were masked and you could not see their faces. I saw one dead man and they were loaded into a car for burial. They were saying 'the martyr', which is the only word that you can understand for an al-Shabaab member who's been killed."
The dead man was Abdulkadir's bodyguard, according to one source in the town. On Tuesday, the Somali defence minister, Abdihakim Haji Mohamud Fiqi, claimed two al-Shabaab members had been killed: "We have found that two senior commanders – one of them foreign – were killed in the attack despite the top target not being found." A UN official in Somalia also said two al-Shabaab figures had been killed: one Sudanese man and another of Somali and Swedish origin.
Sheikh continued: "There were more fighters and supporters of al-Shabaab coming to the house in the morning; they were vowing that they will kill anyone who is found working with the non-believers.
"On the beach, the residents were looking at items left by US forces. I saw a grey military bullet-proof jacket. There was also blood scattered on the ground. There were military boots on the ground which we suspect were those of the Americans."
Local backlash
In the aftermath of the US assault, al-Shabaab deployed more heavily armed fighters to patrol the streets of Barawe, while also posting men and anti-aircraft weapons on the beach. There was also a local backlash with a hunt for suspected informants who helped US intelligence locate the house. A man who frequently used the local internet café was arrested on Sunday and is still being held.
Al-Shabaab took control of Barawe in 2008 and it became a refuge for its senior figures after they lost control of the capital, Mogadishu, and other towns in 2011. These have included the leader Ahmed Godane, who has been described as Africa's most wanted man after the Westgate mall bombing in Nairobi; Omar Hammami, the so-called "jihadist rapper" from Alabama killed last month after falling out with Godane; and Abdulkadir himself.

Barawe is about 135 miles (218km) from Mogadishu. The nearest town where government and African Union forces have control is Shalanbood, only 68 miles (110km) away. To the east is the Ambaresa training camp for al-Shabaab's foreign fighters. Forced marriage is common in Barawe: when al-Shabaab commanders including foreign fighters come for their daughter, few parents can say no, even if the girl is underage.
The events of Saturday 5 October could boost al-Shabaab's confidence in its defences but also give it notice that the world's most powerful military is ready to bring the battle to its doorstep. Speaking at a mosque in Barawe on Monday night, al-Shabaab's military operations spokesperson Sheikh Abiasis Abu Mus'ab said: "Western countries … have to bear in mind we know that we are your target, but we will not be caught off guard.
"We know you are sharpening your knives to cut our heads off. We know our enemies. We will not oversleep so you can attack us at once. We are always vigilant and your cowardly attacks will end in failure."
Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, who studies Somalia and al-Shabaab at the Foundation for the Defence of Democracies, described Barawe as "right now the strongest area of sanctuary" for the militant group. They said it was likely that al-Shabaab expected something like a foreign raid after it perpetrated the attack on Nairobi's Westgate mall.
Gartenstein-Ross said the probable immediate response by al-Shabaab would centre around strengthening its internal security and grip on Barawe, rather than launching another terror attack.
"The raid has made them very nervous," they added. "In Barawe it's already been reported that al-Shabaab has implemented curfews. There will be an uptick in operational security and they will certainly use the way they repulsed this attack by navy Seals as a propaganda piece."

But the US defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, said the operation in Somalia, along with a near-simultaneous one in Libya, demonstrated the "unparalleled precision, global reach and capabilities" of US counter-terrorism. "These operations in Libya and Somalia send a strong message to the world that the United States will spare no effort to hold terrorists accountable, no matter where they hide or how long they evade justice," Hagel said.
Pentagon spokesperson George Little suggested that more special operations raids against al-Shabaab were yet to come. "Working in partnership with the government of the Federal Republic of Somalia, the United States military will continue to confront the threat posed by al-Shabaab," Little said in a statement on Monday. "The United States military has unmatched capabilities and could rely on any of them to disrupt terrorist networks and plots."
President Obama's deal to secure the release of American POW Bowe Bergdahl from Afghanistan in exchange for the release of five Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo Bay may have set a landspeed record for "fastest descent into a partisan foodfight." The issue has become utterly, totally partisan, with Republicans and conservative media slamming Obama for the move — demonstrated by these hilariously hypocritical tweets by conservatives who had previously attacked Obama for not releasing Bergdahl now attacking them for doing exactly the thing they'd wanted them to do. They're worth highlighting not pick on conservatives, but to illustrate the psychology of partisanship and how it's driving the Bowe Bergdahl debate.
Majority.fm's Matt Binder and LobeLog contributor Derek Davison noticed something funny: just before Bergdahl was released, conservatives on Twitter loved to blast Obama for not freeing Bergdahl. There was even a whole meme on conservative Twitter saying Bergdahl was "abandoned by this administration."
But all of a sudden after Bergdahl was released, these people changed their tune. Here's 8 particularly choice examples that Binder and Davison dug up:
1. "Obama had to lay out the red carpet for the terrorists"
2. "Stand them against the wall with Obummer"
@OpBowe Thanx for follow. Thank you for the opportunity to sign the petition to bring home Bow e Bergdahl. Semper Fi! — George McAdoo (@Ntbornlstnight) May 21, 2013
Shock claim: Army wanted to shoot Bergdahl http://t.co/baWbsYlctx And IMO, they should be. Stand them against the wall with Obummer. — George McAdoo (@Ntbornlstnight) June 3, 2014
3. "#Bergdahl the traitor!"
Plz pray for return of Bowe Rob't Bergdahl capture by Afghan Taliban June 30, 2009! POW! Bring Bowe home!! pic.twitter.com/Ga32NET3WN — Hawkeye (@inhuggermugger) May 31, 2014
.@TamiJ Thx 4 you comment just now to @HughHewitt concerning #Bergdahl the Traitor! I agree, Obama being SO reckless w/ American interests! — Hawkeye (@inhuggermugger) June 3, 2014
4. "Where's the petition to hang that traitor?"
Will this administration do anything to bring P.O.W. Bowe Bergdahl home? #bringbackBergdahl — Jazzy Vajazzleds (@JazzyVajazzleds) May 12, 2014
@msabigail43 @AIIAmericanGirI I signed that petition, where's the petition to hang the traitor? — Jazzy Vajazzleds (@JazzyVajazzleds) June 2, 2014
5. "Obama should b impeached 4 derelict of duty"
Bring Sgt Bowe Bergdahl home. I will shout from the mountain tops until they come home...retweet to all and all Vets. LETS ROLL PEOPLE! — Bob (@p8triat) May 23, 2012

6. "They died because of a traitor #outraged"
7. "US blood on Bowe's hands"

US bloods on Bowe's hands: The men who DIED looking for Bowe #HonorTheFallen pic.twitter.com/9wZy4TEXnX #tcot — according to Amy (@Amyloukingery) June 2, 2014
8. "Another example of the Obama terrorist appeasement policy"
Why has Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl been left behind and practically forgotten by the Obama administration? — Thomas (@lemontree46) January 16, 2014
This whole pro Bergdahl by Obama is just another example of the Obama terrorist appeasement policy...IMPEACH!!!! — Thomas (@lemontree46) June 4, 2014
It's not just these eight people. Binder and Davison found tons of them.
It's true that the less savory parts of Bergdahl's story — the accusations that they got US soldiers killed, for instance — came out after their release. But we've known for years that Bergdahl had beliefs that could be described as anti-American, and was very likely a deserter. Michael Hastings' blockbuster Rolling Stone story on just these points came out in June 2012. Anyone who was really following the Bergdahl saga wouldn't be surprised by much of what's been discussed since its release.
The point is that these people either didn't care about those details until the case became a partisan issue, or weren't actually following the Bergdahl issue. They just latched onto an ideologically convenient way to bash Obama. You think the president hates the troops — why hasn't they brought our captured man home? You think Obama is secretly anti-American — why did they release Taliban leaders to free a traitor?
Now, you can find people saying just about anything if you search long enough on Twitter. But these tweets perfectly demonstrate the larger principle that politics makes you stupid. A raft of social science research finds that people seek out facts that prove their political worldview correct, and ignore or reject the ones that challenge it. It's so bad that, in experiments, people reject the right answers to math problems when their conclusion is ideologically threatening.
From the get-go, the POW's release was politicized
So it is with Bergdahl, and beyond just these tweets. From the get-go, the POW's release was politicized: the White House held a Rose Garden ceremony announcing their release. That's about as close to a literal victory lap as you could get.
As a consequence, the issue became an important part of each political tribe's defining identity. If you're a liberal, you had to believe that Obama did the right thing freeing Bergdahl. If you're a conservative, you needed to believe that Obama screwed up.
So immediately, two sets of facts emerged. As the collected tweets prove, people just totally transformed their beliefs about Bergdahl to fit the more politically convenient conclusion. As a consequence, the legitimate issues about their release — whether Obama broke the law, for instance — are in danger of being ignored.

When Europeans talk about air pollution, they often think of India or China, but rarely consider their own continent to be at risk. And while levels of air pollution have decreased throughout Europe over the past decades, a new study by Austrian scientists concludes that smog is far from being defeated on the continent.
Scientists with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis predict that by 2030, many European cities will be faced with air pollution levels far above limits set by the World Health Organization and the European Union. Whereas many Europeans already live in polluted areas today, conditions will worsen in certain cities if no significant measures are taken to stop the deterioration.
"We show the potential and the need for further emission controls to achieve safe levels of air quality – current legislation will not do the job," researcher Gregor Kiesewetter, who led the study, said on the Web site of their institute. "Air pollution has a major impact on human health, contributing to lung and heart disease," the scientists warned.
What is surprising is that the cities which will suffer most are not necessarily the biggest ones. London, for instance, is expected to have harmless levels of pollution, despite its current smog, which has led to an E.U. lawsuit against Britain for the country's failure to reduce pollution levels. "By 2030, the introduction of diesel particle filters will have diminished the current impact from local traffic sources on air quality in some European cities," Kiesewetter told The Washington Post.
An alarming presence of dangerous microparticles is primarily predicted for eastern Europe. In the proximity of Krakow, one of Poland's oldest cities, smog will be particularly widespread by 2030, according to the Austrian researchers. Warsaw and Sofia are also predicted to have alarming levels of microparticles because these cities are expected to continue to burn solid fuels such as wood or coal to generate heat.
In western and northern Europe, the cities the hardest hit will include the industrial Spanish port of Gijon, Sweden's capital, Stockholm, southern Germany's Stuttgart, northern Italy's Milan and Turin, and the French capital.
Smog in Paris could have devastating consequences: As one of Europe's largest cities, air pollution would potentially endanger more than 12 million people in the French capital and its suburbs.

Such high levels of air pollution would not come as a total surprise to most Parisians, though. On Mar. 17, 2014, Paris was plagued by thick smog that was even worse than the one in Beijing that day. Back then, authorities responded with an unprecedented measure — banning half of all cars and making public transport free for one week.
In January, the mayor of Paris announced that polluting trucks and buses would no longer be allowed to enter the city, starting in July. It's only the latest measure taken to tackle the Parisian air pollution problem: In December, for instance, the city decided to prohibit the use of open fireplaces.
The air pollution problem of Paris was widely reported internationally and has been used to mock the city, but as the Austrian study shows, other cities are equally at risk.
Some consider the recent Parisian measures to be exaggerated, but supporters of a tough anti-smog stance have a strong counter-argument: Outdoor air pollution is blamed for the deaths of at least 100,000 and, according to some estimates, even as many as 400,000 Europeans each year.
Most of these deaths could easily be prevented, according to the Austrian researchers. "If the most efficient air pollution control technologies that are currently available were implemented across Europe, 99 percent of European monitoring stations would see air pollution levels reduced below E.U. limits by 2030," they concluded.
Barely out of its testing box at Recombu towers, Asus has confirmed that its Transformer tablet is set to be joined by a sequel, and a new sliding relative.
Asus chairperson Jonney Shih told Forbes that they are already working on the next generation of its critically popular, if not well-publicised, Android Honeycomb tablet.
Sadly they wouldn't divulge any details on screen improvements or whether an Eee Pad Transformer 2 would arrive alongside the next version of Android, Ice Cream Sandwich.
Rumours suggest it'll arrive with the next generation of Nvidia chips – a quad-core Tegra 3, codenamed Kal-El. Dual-core is so dated.
In a report from Forbes, Asus have claimed their Transformer tablet has been the top-selling tablet for two weeks on Amazon. Asus boss Shih added that 300,00 units were shipped in June, with another 400,000 in July 2011.
Asus had a new tablet to reveal too. Pictured above, and channelling some smartphone design ideas, the Eee Pad Slider tablet packs a full slide-out keyboard.
It's running Google's Android 3.1 Honeycomb OS (with the promise of an update to the recently released Android 3.2) and a 178-degree IPS (in-plane switching) display for enviable viewing angles. The tablet is set to arrive in pearl white or metallic brown.
Similar to the Eee Pad Transformer, you'll find Nvidia's dual-core Tegra 2 chipset, and a rear-facing 5-megapixel camera, paried with a front-facing 1.2-megapixel shooter.
Connectivity-wise the Slider looks set to make your head spin, with an eMMC slot, USB port, microSD card reader, and miniHDMI port. More news on a UK release date – and prices – when we get them.

Secondary metabolites present in lichens, which comprise aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic and terpenic compounds, are unique with respect to those of higher plants and show interesting biological and pharmacological activities. However, only a few of these compounds, have been assessed for their effectiveness against various in vitro cancer models. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of three lichen secondary metabolites (atranorin, gyrophoric acid and physodic acid) on A375 melanoma cancer cell line. The tested compounds arise from different lichen species collected in different areas of Continental and Antarctic Chile. The obtained results confirm the major efficiency of depsidones. In fact, depsides atranorin and gyrophoric acid, showed a lower activity inhibiting the melanoma cancer cells only at more high concentrations. Whereas the depsidone physodic acid, showed a dose-response relationship in the range of 6.25–50 μM concentrations in A375 cells, activating an apoptotic process, that probably involves the reduction of Hsp70 expression. Although the molecular mechanism, by which apoptosis is induced by physodic acid remains unclear, and of course further studies are needed, the results here reported confirm the promising biological properties of depsidone compounds, and may offer a further impulse to the development of analogues with more powerful efficiency against melanoma cells.
Donald Trump is a 'vulgar, demented, pig demon' who only appeals to 'emasculated' middle-aged men, the former innovation adviser to Hillary Clinton has said.
Alec Ross, who was senior aide to Clinton during their term as Secretary of State, was speaking at The Hay Festival in Wales about the industries of the future.
Ross, said that the most open countries would have the greatest success in the coming decades because the biggest emerging markets were big data and genomics. But they warned that America could become a more closed society if Donald Trump was elected president.
"We're having this struggle very publicly in the United States right now where a vulgar, demented, pig demon named Donald Trump is trying to make the United States a more closed society.
"We'll be saying, no more brown people, no more Muslims, let's get women back in the kitchen. Let's make America great again.
"What he's talking about is taking emasculated men in their forties, fifties and sixties who are not living the life they hoped for in their teens and twenties and saying, 'you know what? there are people to blame for this. And we're going to build a wall and we're going make America great again.
"At the core of that is the struggle between being an open society and a closed society. And so if you want to know where the trillions of dollars of wealth creation that are going to come with the commercialisation of genomics, and the creation of big data companies, and the AI machine learning companies and all of the industries of the future my overarching line here is it's going to be the most open societies.
"Open societies means that upward economic and social mobility is not constrained to elites, it means that religious and cultural norms are not set by central authorities and it means that it is wildly rights respecting, in terms of the rights of women, religious minorities, racial minorities and ethic minorities.
"The industries of the future will be overwhelmingly concentrated in the most open societies."
When entertaining ideas for commercial products to draw inspirations from to stylise the Mona Lisa, I couldn't stop thinking about Futurama. This isn't unusual on any given day, because I think about Futurama a lot (because it is awesome!). However, in this case it was because the heavy 'Da Vinci' element of the topic matter reminded me of Futurama season 6 episode 5: 'The Duh-Vinci Code', in which the characters find themselves in Rome, and pursuing Da Vinci's secrets.
An assignment I submitted for Art History. The objective was to utilise popular renaissance era art to promote a contemporary product.
My thought process here was relatively simple. 'Lisa' kinda sounds like 'Leela'. Once I realised this, I drew Leela as a vector in Illustrator (using the garment adorned by the Mona Lisa proper for inspiration) and then made liberal use of Photoshop's Filter Gallery and layer Blending Options to tweak it to my satisfaction. The 'Mona Leela' completed work stands as a potential promotional piece for a show I love. I have included the stylised Futurama opening titles to accentuate this.
The background is a vectorised screen-capture of my own from the asupervisorstioned Futurama episode 'The Duh-Vinci Code', and features the 3013 Rome skyline as it appears in Futurama canon. Since Leela is an animated cartoon character, I wanted to be consistent with my work as a whole, inserting an image in similar illustrated style. I did this in the hope that the compounding use of Matt Groening's illustrated style in both foreground and background wouldn't distract too much from the subject, as I was unsure how the realist artwork and craquelure oil canvas of the actual Mona Lisa's environment would interact with Leela's much more minimalist and caricatured style. Having said that, the background sky from the top-left to the top-right part of the portrait is directly borrowed from the Mona Lisa, and was used as the colour palette to stylise the rest of my work as close to the actual Mona Lisa as was possible.
The casting call is sounding for 500 zombies, needed by filmmaker Leigh Ormsby for their latest horror The Last Hope.
Ormsby needs extras for one of the largest action scenes to be filmed in Victoria including the western suburbs.
The Last Hope features a post-apocalyptic world invaded by zombies, and tracks foreign survivors who arrive in Australia by boat.

Ormsby says the script doesn't aim to take a stance.
“It just helps to start the conversation about what we do in certain situations,” they say. “We're pushing the limits on everything we know.”
Ormsby, with a team of close friends and film buffs, crowdfunded to get the $3000 project off the ground, and is funnelling earnings from their day job at a bank for the rest.
“It was a short film, originally for fun, but it's just grown into something so much bigger than we anticipated,” Ormsby says.
“We wanted to make a movie that changes the view of the Melbourne independent film industry.”
The Last Hope is expected to screen in cinemas next year. Contact: facebook.com/filmthelasthope
On Monday, the National Science Foundation doubled-down on its commitment to eradicating sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination in science with the announcement that it may terminate funding to any institution that fails to adhere to Title IX guidelines.
“In light of recent, multiple reports of sexual harassment in science, NSF reiterates its unwavering dedication to inclusive workplaces,” reads a press release.
“NSF does not tolerate sexual harassment and encourages members of the scientific community who experience such harassment to report such behavior immediately. As the primary funder of fundamental science and engineering research in the U.S., NSF supports researchers and students at the forefront of their fields—each of whom deserves to be treated fairly, with dignity and respect.”
The press release follows a similar letter from NASA administrator Charles F. Bolden Jr. which called sexual harassment “conduct that is not only illegal but destroys the very fabric of our STEM community,” and urged grantee institutions to re-examine their policies for addressing it.
In the past month alone, the issue of gender discrimination and harassment within the scientific community has been cast in an unsettling spotlight. Mashable reported on former University of Arizona astronomy professor Timothy Frederick Slater, who regularly commented on women's bodies and once gave a student a vibrator. BuzzFeed told the story of Christian Ott, an astrophysics professor at the California Institute of Technology, who fell in love with a female graduate student and fired them because of it. Before that, we learned of the allegations against astronomer Geoff Marcy who supposedly kissed, massaged, and groped four female students.

None of these professors has lost their job, and Marcy has been given the honorific title “emeritus.”
In July 2014, an online survey of field scientists found that almost two-thirds of 666 respondents had been sexually harassed at a field sight, and 20 percent had been sexually assaulted, according to Science. Another survey of 426 people working in astronomy and planetary science found that 57 percent of respondents had been verbally harassed because of their gender and 82 percent had heard a colleague make a sexist remark. The hashtag #astroSH reveals many, many more accounts of similar experiences.
While NASA and the NSF's statements (which are not new policies, just stern reminders of existing ones) signals a growing awareness that the scientific community is often hostile toward women, it puts the burden of change onto the victim, urging them to report them harassment. Such an approach likely won't do much more than overload ill-equipped administrative offices—for the past several decades, academic science has proven itself a hardened system that bends only to accommodate its men.

In order for real change to be affected, universities need to start holding professors found to be guilty of harassment accountable for their actions.
Last week, an anonymous female researcher at a major university wrote an article in Nature describing the professional and personal consequences they suffered after reporting their former postdoctoral supervisor's continued sexual harassment.
After they filed a complaint, in which they claimed that their boss had published their data sets without their name included on the author list or their permission, they were attacked. They wrote:
...my harasser responded with dozens of pages of denials and counter-complaints, to which I was expected to respond. They belittled me, demanded access to my data sets, misrepresented evidence and argued for restrictions that would significantly detriment my career. Because of these issues and the confidential nature of the accusation, I found it nearly impossible to publish during the lengthy complaint process (which took much longer than laid out in the university's own grievance procedures). I felt I had to excuse myself from international conferences, because I knew that they would be there. Their career continued unaffected.
After almost a year and a half, their university told me that it had found in my favour. It said that they were guilty of both research misconduct and inappropriate behaviour, including sexual harassment. It did not fire them and stressed that I should keep the verdict confidential.

Recently, they reached out to the organizers of a scientific conference to see if they would be permitted to attend. Because the university's investigation outcome had been secret, there was nothing the organizers could do.
“Until victims feel able to speak up freely, and details of such situations are shared, it is not the guilty parties who are punished, but young scientists,” they wrote, adding that Nature's editors had encouraged them to remain anonymous to avoid having readers speculate about their various male colleagues.
Multiple groups have taken steps to increase reporting: Astronomy Allies encourages women who have been harassed at the American Astronomical Society conferences to come forward, while others, including the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, have released statements regarding unacceptable conference behavior.
Advertisement
On a broader scale, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) is pushing legislation that would prevent male scientists from being able to hide behind institutional secrecy, although it is unclear how such legislation would work.
“We're developing legislation that would first require that any investigation at one university where the professor either resigns or is fired, that information would follow them,” Rep. Speier said in an interview with Wired. “That investigation should follow the individual.”
On January 12, Speier spoke about such a bill on the House floor.
“Some universities protect predatory professors with slaps on the wrist and secrecy, just like the Catholic Church sheltered child-molesting priests for many decades,” they said. “Students enter astronomy to study the stars, not the professor's sex life.”

Along with the anonymous account, the journal Nature ran an op-ed condemning universities' treatment of sexual harassment victims.
“Any principal investigator who thinks, ‘it cannot happen at my university,' is wrong,” the op-ed read. “These are not one-off cases. They are examples of a systemic underlying rot that is driving many young researchers out of science for good.”

“Show me the microfiche”, said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. “Show the microfiche – and it's all over.”
The Sheriff is referring to the missing microfiche that would clear the President's name in what has become a national debate surrounding the authenticity of their own birth certificate.
The President is currently dragging behind them a sizeable cache of potentially crippling scandals, of which questionable identity documents are the most significant. Now the Arizona Sheriff's Office's initial investigation into this issue has progressed from an inquiry, into a fully-fledged, ongoing law enforcement investigation.
“What we are looking at is two possible forged government documents”, explains Arpaio. “If it was you or anybody else, everyone would say, ‘How come you're not arresting this guy and how come you're not doing anything?' Just because it's the President nobody wants to touch it?”
Thus far, neither Republicans nor Democrats have been willing to face this thorny issue, which guarantees that it will continue to fester under the surface right through to November. Arpaio adds here, “What is this? A political year that everybody's afraid to talk about it… where they don't want to face this issue? That's sad”.
Watch our special report here:
Infowars conducted a special video report (above), traveling to Phoenix to conduct a series of exclusive interviews with the Maricopa County Sheriff and their Cold Case Posse lead investigator Mike Zullo, as well as interviews with WND senior reporter Dr. Jerome Corsi to discover the details of this case. In addition, we talked to Arizona State Rep. Carl Seel, and State Senator Lori Klein about a current bill on the table which would force the President to prove their eligibilty to appear on the state's ballot.
In addition to Investigator Zullo's evidence pointing to Obama's forged birth certificate released by the White House in April 2011, our special report also covers important new information was revealed during the news conference including a request by Sheriff Joe Arpaio to the current head of the Selective Service Board to investigate the criminal forgery committed in the case of Barack Obama's Selective Service registration, as well as new evidence from Dr. Corsi pointing to missing Obama's INS immigration records from the month of August 1961, and challenging Obama's claim to their US natural born citizenship.

UPDATE 2: Amazon broke it and a lot of other two word devices. Removing the space from “MyCar” works.
UPDATE: Amazon OR SmartThings BROKE virtual switch capability with the echo earlier this week. It shows up under discovered devices and just gives a failed tone when triggered. I have inquired about this and have not heard back yet.
The elusive Part 6 of my Amazon Echo car start series is finally here!
So here we are, you read through the first five posts and are thinking to yourself “Ok Jryan, how in the hell do I do this myself?! Simple directions please.”
A little demanding tone, but ok, I'll oblige.
WARNING: THIS ONLY WORKS ON GM CARS! Don't waste your time trying other cars unless you're up to months of frustration figuring it out. It *may* work on others, but you WILL need to find out the can-bus to use, the can-bus entry point, and the commands to use and how to structure them.
Gather your materials
Smart Things (No link, I will detail in another post eventually why I am no longer recommending the platform. That's what I have currently setup in my home, but not for much longer. Summed up, it's unreliable.)
Raspberry Pi Model A+
Raspberry Pi Model A+ Case (The one I have is no longer made, you're on your own here.)
Sandisk SD Card
Bluetooth/Wifi Dongle
OBDLink MX Bluetooth
Car Adapter
A random generic USB hub, USB Keyboard/Mouse, HDMI Cable, MicroUSB wall adaptor, android tablet or phone. All of this is needed JUST for setup. If you are seriously reading this right now, setting this all up, I guarantee you have all of these things already.
NOTES:
Vera, OpenHAB, HomeSeer will all work, but I am not outlining the directions here. Maybe later if I am asked for specifics on these systems.
I suppose you could use a Rpi zero as well. I can't tell you how it works though BECAUSE I CAN'T OBTAIN ONE! Also, steer clear of ALL OTHER MODELS of the Rpi, including the new Rpi 3, the power draw is too high for this project, among other issues you may have. If you aren't going to attempt this until June, give the $9 C.H.I.P computer a try.
The Cirago Bluetooth Wifi dongle I used is no longer available and I HAVE NOT personally tested the one I listed.
Feel free to use whatever car adapter you'd like. Power issues are a bitch though. My Samsung fast charge car adapter has been great.
WTF, root? Sudo for the web service? ARE YOU MAD?! Yeah, well, do whatever you'd like. This is not a device sitting on the public internet, you can only get to it from the local network. If you want to secure it even more Mr. (Or Mrs.?) Paranoid, be my guest.
Perform The Steps
CLOSE Here are some of the top stories on our website for Tuesday December 5th. 12/5/17 Damian Giletto/The News Journal
Archaeologists have uncovered a 17th-century burial site west of Rehoboth Beach, and the earliest African-American gravesites known in Delaware. Shown here are two of 11 people found at Avery's Rest. (Photo: Donald E. Hurlbert, Smithsonian Institution)
A local archaeologist was searching for the remnants of a 17th-century home near Rehoboth when they stumbled on a discovery that could rewrite chapters of Delaware history.
Dan Griffith was following a centuries-old fence line at Avery's Rest, once an 800-acre colonial farmstead near Rehoboth Beach, when the trail led them to a burial site containing some of the First State's earliest settlers.
“We were looking for something else,” the Frederica resident said. “That's typical of archaeology.”
Griffith made the discovery in 2014, more than three decades after their first visit to the site. They quickly contacted state officials when they unearthed bones, sending along a photograph labeled, “Burial No. 1.”
Then came No. 2. Then No. 3.
Griffith and their team of volunteers eventually uncovered the unmarked graves of 11 people who once braved the New World in the marshy brush of southern Delaware.
Among those settlers, archaeologists found the earliest known grave site of African Americans in Delaware.
Two of the three African Americans were likely slaves of the site's first occupant, John Avery. The third was a child about 5 years old, whose remains are the worst preserved skeleton at the site due to a burrowing groundhog.

Archaeologists and historians say the find could push the frontier of what they know about the people who made up the Delmarva Peninsula's early settlers.
“The potential for future research and the potential to connect this find with the stories of the lives of these people is really breath-taking to think about,” said Tim Slavin, director of the state Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs. “This place kind of reframes our whole interpretation of African-American history in Delaware.”
Griffith estimates the 11 people buried at Avery's Rest, which also includes two women, six men and an infant of European descent, were buried sometime between 1665 and 1695. The eight Europeans are buried separately – and were likely buried later – than the three African Americans, they said.
“[The entire burial site] was totally unmarked and unknown,” Griffith said. “When we got there, it was just a fallow field. It was quite an adventure.”
Questions remain about whom those people were and where they came from.
Now, experts at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History are beginning to unearth those answers using DNA and comparative analysis of other colonial grave sites throughout the Chesapeake region.

Dr. Doug Owsley, one of the top forensic anthropologists in the world, hopes to learn more about the movements of America's earliest settlers by studying the 17th century remains found at sites like Avery's Rest, historic St. Mary's City in Maryland and the early settlement at Jamestown, Virginia.
“We're working ... to tell the Chesapeake story from a different perspective that's truly from the people themselves,” they said. “It's just so fascinating when you're talking about the 17th century and how much was not recorded about the lives and origins of the people themselves.”
The remains have been removed from their graves and are being studied at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. Delaware historians, meanwhile, are planning a future exhibit to highlight the discovery.
From the remains, Owsley can determine sex, age, diet, health conditions and the extent of the physical demands of the lives of these early settlers. Because the sandy soils near Rehoboth Bay helped preserve the skeletons, facial reconstruction modeling is a possibility – allowing scientists to learn not only who the people were but also what they looked like.
“When all is said and done, I feel we will have a number of these individuals identified by name,” Owsley said. “This is a spectacular site.”

Searching for identities
The first recorded inhabitants of Avery's Rest were John Avery and their family, who moved there in 1674 and tamed the wilderness into a farmstead.
At that time, the British were firmly in control of the area, which previously was ruled by the Dutch. Technically, the region then was still Pennsylvania. It would be another century before Delaware became the First State.
“When it became more stable politically, [Avery] moved up there and then became a member of the court in Lewes,” Griffith said. “The Dutch are still in town, and you're really seeing the first European colonization along the coast.”
At that time, Lewes was known as Whorekill and Avery was known as a boisterous, foul-mouthed drunk among their fellow judges. Whorekill – the word "kill" in Dutch means creek or river – was the first settlement in Delaware, occupied by the Dutch in 1631.
Griffith and Owsley don't believe Avery, who died in 1682 when Whorekill was renamed Lewes, is buried at Avery's Rest. It is possible that their wife, Sarah, and one of their daughters were laid to rest there. At least four of the Europeans – the two women 50-60 and 35-45, a man about 30-40 and a 5-month-old baby – are related to each other in some way, DNA evidence has shown.
“The amazing thing is there's such new capability in science,” Owsley said. “You could not have done this five years ago.”
Around the time the Averys moved to the site from Maryland, there were less than three dozen homes near Delaware's beaches, most in the Lewes area. Today, only a small portion of the privately owned site where the burials were found remains undeveloped.

The Averys harvested corn, wheat and tobacco. Evidence suggests they grew some of the first imported peach trees. They also raised a lot of cows and pigs – far too many for one family to consume, Griffith said.
“There's evidence their wife billed the courts for 2.5 tons of pork they hadn't paid for,” Griffith said.
Historical documents also note Avery had two slaves, possibly the two African-American men buried feet away from the Europeans.
While their identities are still a mystery, it's clear the people buried at Avery's Rest did not have easy lives. Almost everyone found at the site suffered from poor dental health and back problems, evidence of a corn-based diet and life of labor.
Two of the people, a white man about 35-45 and an African American man about 27-37, had skull fractures that may have contributed to their deaths.
Avery's Rest also marks an early period of African slaves coming to the Mid-Atlantic.
The three African Americans buried at the site are not related, and evidence suggests they had lived in the Mid-Atlantic region for most of their lives, Owsley said.
Their maternal lineages connect to West Africa, but also trace back to central and east Africa, offering insight into the transatlantic slave trade.
“It adds even more complexity to our understanding of how people were moving around and where they were coming from,” said Dr. Angela Winand, who heads Delaware Historical Society's Mitchell Center for African American Heritage and Diversity Program. “It complicates our understanding of the development of Delaware as a state in that colonial period.”
A 'spectacular find'
The Cape Region was a new frontier for European settlers long before Delaware's coastal towns became booming hubs for tourism.
Nestled among housing developments and crowded roads, Avery's Rest has revealed artifacts from the mid- to late-1600s and early 1700s and revealed details about a life that included heavy farming labor, trade with Native Americans and a lot of tobacco smoking, as evidenced by stains on the teeth of the recently discovered remains.
“This is a frontier site, with people out there in the hinterlands,” Owsley said. “Here you're learning about some of the first people in Delaware.”

Griffith first discovered Avery's Rest in 1976 when, as the state archaeologist, they set out to survey areas of historical significance under threat from development.
At that time, the land was still in agricultural use. The Harmon family had farmed there since the 1920s, occasionally coming across an arrowhead or smooth stone they'd admire without much thought.
Waymon Harmon, now 75, remembers playing in the fields as a child and making those discoveries. As an adult, they farmed the land, planting corn and soybeans – not unlike the people who had lived there more than three centuries earlier.
“I was born right across the road from there and I played all around the area out in the field,” said Harmon, who granted archaeologists access to their private property for their excavation work.
“I used to farm right there,” they said. “I didn't know it was there but I thought it was quite possible.”
After their initial foray, Griffith did not return to the site again until about 2006, a year after they retired from their state job. Development in the resort area was ramping up and a mad rush to collect as many artifacts as possible was underway.
The economic downturn a few years later gave members of the Archaeological Society of Delaware a little more time to work. By 2010, Griffith and a crew of volunteers had collected so many artifacts they had to stop working in the field and start cataloging their finds, including a 17th-century cellar and two wells, beads, buttons, coins, oyster and clamshells, pipe pieces and agricultural tools.

“It's the beginning of the English spreading across the countryside,” Griffith said.
The burials were discovered in 2014 as society members continued searching for the house they knew had to be on the site. That's when they called in the state and the Smithsonian to assist.
Officials have waited until now to announce the burial site because they wanted to wait for the results of initial studies on the remains. They also wanted to protect artifacts from looters and avoid trespassing on the private property while site work was underway.
By the time their excavations were complete, Griffith handed over 219 boxes of shell, brick, bone and other artifacts to the state, while the 11 skeletons were sent to the Smithsonian.
When archaeologists found evidence of a 17th-century settlement at a site known as Avery's Rest near Rehoboth Beach, they knew a house should be nearby. Before finding the foundation of a structure, experts uncovered 11 colonial-era burials, and the oldest known gravesite of African Americans discovered in Delaware. (Photo: Submitted photo)
Researching centuries-old genealogy is no easy feat for historians. And tracking down the stories of 17th-century African Americans has posed a nearly insurmountable challenge for decades.
The wealth of information uncovered at Avery's Rest may change that for Delaware and help put the state's history in better context among the story of the nation as a whole.
“It's another occasion for placing us on a world stage and international stage in a way we don't often think about,” Winand said. “Being part of those trade networks is essential to why the colony was created and established.”

The question of drafting America's young daughters is finally making the average voter consider the real implications of fully integrating the combat arms. The large majority of the population may have little or no connection to the military and therefore no concept of what's at stake, until now. They've simply supported the idea because they support women generally, and think it'll be their choice.
The question of drafting America's young daughters is finally making the average voter consider the real implications of fully integrating the combat arms.
Drafting women is a bad idea because putting women into combat units is a bad idea on a myriad of fronts from degraded combat readiness to skyrocketing injuries, risk, expense, and danger to the long-term medical bill and increased casualties. We always need men to fight whereas drafting women is totally unnecessary.
Justifying a policy with such wide-ranging negative impacts based on the performance of a couple of women like the ones who graduated from Ranger School is ludicrous. Having equal natural rights under the law does not mean men and women are the same. Combat is not an equal opportunity for women because they don't have an equal opportunity to survive.
The combat integration policy has been sold to us on smoke. Advocates for it have made the demonstrably false claim that women are physically capable of anything military men are while decades of military and sports medicine studies prove the opposite. They've ignored the heavy negative effects that sexual dynamics already have on coed units, especially those that deploy. They've told us women becoming men's physical equals is just a matter of leadership and training when women tested continually demonstrate it's nature, not nurture, dictating the reality here.
These same proponents have maligned the Marine Corps' impeccable 9-month Gender Integration Task Force study as “flawed”—except for the parts they like, of course. They love the part about co-ed teams being better at decision-making but omitted that the women were rested at the time, and these were a mere two of the 134 combat tasks. That all-male teams outperformed them on 69 percent of tasks and they retained more than twice men's injuries must be hushed up and suppressed as they obliterate the argument that women strengthen combat readiness.
With a dictate from Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus to increase female representation in the ranks to 25 percent, top-performing military women can be plucked from their units to “show success” in a combat unit. If the next president agrees with this scheme, who's to say they or they won't use the draft to get the desired “diversity metrics”? The Obama administration has done all sorts of unprecedented things. Women, especially athletic ones, are not going to have the choice to ride a desk to “free a man to fight” like in WWII. They will be under orders just like men, and they will go where the military needs them even if that “need” is to achieve “diversity metrics.”
The prospect of drafting women brings the issue home to average Americans who before had no skin in the game. Realizing now that this isn't just about “a few women who want to,” they are starting to internalize the meaning of “tip of the spear,” and they don't want their daughters there, fighting the rape- and beheading-happy ISIS. Technology has not lessened the face-to-face bludgeoning that our infantrymen are doing when the gun jams or ammo runs out as they're fighting house to house and cave to cave on foot.
But is it too little, too late? The policy is in place, but policies change. Although Israel hasn't put women in direct combat since 1948, they experimented with women in tank crews and the armored corps and reversed the policy. Britain, too, has gone back and forth depending on who's in office. Although neither is comparable to the U.S. military's size and scope, both found the same problems: much higher injuries and lower performance among women that skyrocketed costs and degraded readiness.
Congress can defund or postpone the effort in the next National Defense Authorization Act, or postpone implementation until they can review the studies and ramifications. It may take the next president to reinstate women's combat exemption, but it can be done.

This morning when I woke up, I had a missed call on my phone from 2:13am from a number I'd never seen in my life. I never heard a ring. My colleague called me about 5 minutes before I left for work to let me know he'd be a little late. Phone rang, clear as a bell. While eating my breakfast in a hurry, I downloaded a podcast over my Wi-Fi, already activated on the phone. During the last part of my leaving-home ritual, I turned on my bluetooth headphones, and opened BeyondPod – suddenly, bluetooth was activated on my phone. I hit play on the one I wanted to hear, and set off. While at a red light driving in, I felt my phone vibrate. A quick glance tells me I've received a Facebook notification over my now-active 3G connection. When I arrived at work, I turned off my bluetooth headphones; another fast look at my Nexus shows me that BeyondPod is closed, and bluetooth has been disabled. Once I was finally sitting at my desk, my phone vibrated again, longer this time to indicate it was a phone call. I answer, and my colleague reports they will now be half an hour late. Minutes later, my phone rings loudly – my boss on the line, and something needed to get done urgently.
All of this took place without me touching any of the settings on my phone, thanks to the little Llama icon in the top-left corner of my screen.
Llama is an incredibly powerful location and scheduling tool for your phone. In the story above, it killed apps I was done using, enabled/disabled bluetooth, enabled/disabled Wi-Fi, went from silent too loud to vibrate, allowed specific numbers to ring loudly regardless of other settings… and I'm barely scratching the surface of what it can do.
Very small samples of the ‘Conditions' and ‘Actions' – best thought of as the causes and effects.
Llama (Location Aware Mobile App, with an extra ‘L' for flavor) determines where you are by using phone masts (that's cell towers, to my fellow Americans) rather than GPS, not so much to pinpoint where to find you, but more to make seperate profiles for the spaces you designate. Where you live you may only have 2 cell towers nearby that your phone can poll; at work you may have 3 to poll from; this is a distinction the app can use. Due to this, it is recommended that you live in a relatively urban area where there are more cell towers if you want to rely on Llama. People in more rural or sparsely populated areas may have just one cell tower to poll for a large radius, leaving Llama in the lurch.
Once Llama knows a location or two, the things you can do are incredibly useful. It uses ‘Conditions' and ‘Actions' – in other words, it reacts to what's going on, on and off the phone… and that isn't limited to just where you are. For instance, you may set it to turn off your Wi-Fi when you leave home, or to turn on silent mode when you enter the library. You can have it automatically launch your GPS navigation app of choice, or any application for that matter, when you leave your home. You can have it kill apps if you are rooted and give it the access to do so. If you wanted, you could have it disable bluetooth when it notices that your bluetooth device has disconnected. You can turn data off when the battery gets below a certain percentage. The possibilities, while not endless, are lengthy.
These four screens are the settings for just ONE Profile. Definitely daunting at first; exceedingly awesome once you get used to it.
This app is not perfect, yet. The developer did not have access to a 4G handset when making it, so the settings involving 4G may or may not work. There are a lot of ‘experimental' settings which I have not tried, because I'm not in the game to experiment. It also does better with several simple events rather than complicated events; for instance, I tried to have it kill bluetooth and my two most-used media apps when I turned off my headphones with one event; I had to break it into three events to make it work properly. The app also has a steep learning curve; it was quite intimidating at first, but that was just me confusing ‘option-packed' with ‘complexity'. The UI isn't entirely intuitive. Thankfully, there's a Help button in the app.
THE TL;DR:
Unprecedented value and functionality for a free app with no ads that I could find. DONATE GENEROUSLY!
Massively customizable to suit your individual needs.
A little scary.
Some functions require root access.
Far better for city life than farm life due to how it locates you.
Does not eat your battery unless you set it to do so.
Developer has a good sense of humor.
Not complete; does not seem to work on 4G functions; slightly buggy; clearly a work in progress.
Sony has started seeding Android 4.4.2 KitKat to the Xperia Z1 globally, after several markets got it last week. The software update is marked as version 14.3.A.0.681 and in addition to bringing the latest version of Android to the company's former flagship, it also carries a few other goodies inside.
One of them is the updated camera app, which should improve the overall shooting experience. The camera software is also tuned, so expect to take slightly better pictures. Sony says it has enhanced the email app, but hasn't given details as to what exactly is new.
As usual, there are bug fixes and improvements in the performance and battery departments. Go to Settings > About phone > Software updates and check if the update has been made available for your Xperia Z1.
Thanks for the tip, Gurijala!
