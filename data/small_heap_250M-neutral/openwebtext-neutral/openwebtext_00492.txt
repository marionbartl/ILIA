HOW quickly the need to cut deficits is reducing the European Union's military ambitions. When EU leaders held a summit to discuss defence five years ago there was heady talk of being able to deploy 60,000 troops within 60 days. Today the objective is to get overstretched troops home from Afghanistan as budgets are cut. The EU is meant to have two ‚Äúbattle groups‚Äù of 1,500 men apiece ready to deploy at short notice, but it can barely muster one‚Äîand none has ever been used.
Pressure to make better use of dwindling resources is pushing governments to share costs and pool equipment. At this week's summit, leaders will bless plans to develop a European drone to follow the likes of America's Predator and Reaper. The European version would be an unarmed surveillance system that, unlike military drones, is intended to fly in civilian airspace. Predictably, the plan has caused alarmist talk in Britain about Brussels building a ‚ÄúEuropean air force‚Äù, prompting officials to redouble their effort to remove ambiguities from turgid EU texts.

Yet the truly alarming prospect is that Europe is demilitarising so fast. Forget about euro-troops crying ‚ÄúBanzai!‚Äù Worry instead that the endless pruning of brigades, tanks, ships and jets will reduce even the largest European armed forces into small ‚Äúbonsai armies‚Äù, says Christian M√∂lling of the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, a German think-tank. When European countries led by France and Britain conducted air strikes in Libya in 2011, America had to provide essential help, including drones, air-to-air refuelling, stocks of smart bombs and headquarters staff. Europe has far more soldiers than America, but can send far fewer abroad.
In Mali, and now in the Central African Republic, France has intervened alone, but it wants support from European allies: if not soldiers, trainers for African troops; if not trainers, at least some money. Now France knows how America feels in NATO when it demands more military burden-sharing from allies and chafes at free-riders. Where France was always the chief troublemaker in NATO, in the EU Britain leads the awkward squad.
The problem for EU defence policy, says Daniel Keohane of Fride, a Spanish think-tank, is that ‚ÄúGermany does not want to use military force, Britain does not want to use the EU, and France is caught in the middle.‚Äù In 2011 Britain vetoed plans for an EU operational headquarters, annoying not only France but also Poland. Within NATO, France contributed more forces than Britain to the Steadfast Jazz exercise in Poland and Latvia in November. Russia's decision to put Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad confirms that threats have not gone away.
The theology of European defence is maddening. NATO and the EU are both based in Brussels but can barely speak to each other officially, largely because of the chronic dispute between Turkey (in NATO but not the EU) and Cyprus (in the EU but not NATO). A bigger problem is the growing shortage of resources. Overall defence spending in Europe now stands at about 1.5% of GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. Worse, defence has shrunk as a share of public spending, it being easier to demobilise soldiers than sack teachers. Worse still, Europe gets little bang despite spending nearly ‚Ç¨200 billion ($275 billion) a year on defence. Money is squandered among the myriad armies, navies, air forces and headquarters at national level.
A recent study by the Centre for European Policy Studies, a think-tank in Brussels, makes the point eloquently. Europe has nine kinds of fighters and ground-attack planes, compared with America's four. It sails 16 different frigates compared with just one American type. Europe's defence industry is also crying out for consolidation. As defence spending falls, even the most competitive firms are in trouble. EADS, the Franco-German aerospace consortium, has announced plans to cut 5,800 jobs in France, Germany and Spain because of shrinking defence contracts. Its attempt to merge with Britain's BAE Systems was blocked in October 2012, because of German politics.
The state of the industry is one reason why the EU is waking up to the problem. The European Commission, the EU's civil service, sees defence firms as important providers of jobs and high-end manufacturing. Some of its research-and-development funds are likely to be directed to ‚Äúdual-use‚Äù technology. The same drones used to watch out for migrants at sea or fires on land can help armies look for the enemy in foreign wars.
Uncle Sam needs EU
For all of Europe's shortcomings, it remains the first port of call when the United States needs military help. The EU does much useful smaller-scale work, combining military power with civilian assistance, for instance in and around Somalia to deal with piracy. But if Europe wants to remain a security provider, it must retain the ability to deploy force. That means more European collaboration, not less. Yet a problem with pooling and sharing is that economies of scale are often offset by the extra cost and complexity that adding countries to a procurement project can create. Another is the fear of mutual dependence: martial countries worry that they will be stopped from taking action by an ally that controls a vital capability; more pacific states fear being dragged into somebody else's war.
Collaboration works best among countries of similar outlook and ambitions. France and Britain have gone furthest in merging capabilities. The Nordics and the Benelux countries have also embarked on some joint projects. But as the African interventions show, there will be times when one country wants to go it alone. Military co-operation is the obvious answer. But European countries must first agree on what they want. Until then, if there were ever such a thing as a European army, it would probably do nothing. Right now national forces are being hollowed out.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump would win a hypothetical head-to-head contest against either of their two closest Republican U.S. presidential rivals, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, but they would fall short of beating Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton if the election were held today, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll on Monday.
If the Republican primary featured a face-off between Trump and Cruz, a Texas senator, Trump would win the support of 41 percent of Republican and independent voters, the poll showed. Cruz would take 31 percent, while 28 percent said they would not vote in a Cruz-Trump contest.
If Rubio, a Florida senator, were pitted against Trump, the billionaire real-estate mogul would take 40 percent support of Republican and independent voters to Rubio's 34 percent, according to the poll. Twenty-seven percent said they would not vote. In this matchup, Trump's lead over Rubio is within the survey's credibility interval.
Cruz and Rubio currently sit in second and fourth place of all Republican candidates, respectively, in the run-up to the November 2016 presidential election, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll on Friday.
Despite months of leading the Republican polls, Trump would fall short in a general election competition held today against Clinton, the poll showed. In a one-on-one match-up, the former secretary of state would take 40 percent support of all voters to real estate mogul Trump's 29 percent.
Eight percent of respondents said they did not know which candidate they would support in a Clinton-Trump competition. Fourteen percent said they would not vote for either one, and another 9 percent said they would not vote at all.
The survey of 1,627 likely voters from all parties was conducted between Dec. 16 and Dec. 21, with a credibility interval of 2.8 to 3.7 percentage points.
Server Deployments Week 18
As always, please refer to the server deployment thread for the latest news.
There was no Main (SLS) deployment on Tuesday, April 28th.
On Wednesday, April 29th the three RC channels all received the same sever maintenance package. This comprises Internal server logging changes and a new flag for llGetObjectDetails() ‚Äì OBJECT_LAST_OWNER_ID; plus new data which can be requested via llGetEnv(). These are: ‚Äúagent_limit‚Äù- get the maximum number of avatars normally allowed on the region (teleport home, and login to last location, are allowed to exceed this). ‚Äúestate_name‚Äù- returns the name of the estate (e,g, ‚Äúmainland‚Äù, ‚ÄúLinden Homes‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy Happy Estate‚Äù, etc. ) ‚Äúregion_cpu_ratio‚Äù- returns the number of regions per CPU for this region type (i.e. ‚Äú1‚Äù or ‚Äú4‚Äù) ‚Äúregion_product_name‚Äù ‚Äì returns the type of region this is: ‚ÄúEstate / Full Region‚Äù, ‚ÄúMainland / Homestead‚Äù, ‚ÄúEstate / Openspace‚Äù, ‚ÄúEstate / Full Region ‚Äì Skill Gaming‚Äù etc. ‚Äúregion_product_sku‚Äù ‚Äì returns the region's product number as a string ‚Äúregion_start_time‚Äù ‚Äì returns the time the region was last (re)started, in llGetUnixTime format ‚Äúsimulator_hostname‚Äù ‚Äì returns the simhost running this region. Same as llGetSimulatorHostname but without the script delay.
Commenting on the llGetEnv() updates at the simulator User Group meeting on Tuesday, April 28th, Simon Linden, who made the updates, said, ‚Äúthese are all pretty simple ones ‚Ä¶ I went for the easy pickings. Basically, information we already sent to the viewer, or was readily available, and thus not a privacy issue.‚Äù
They continued, ‚ÄúThere was one [further option] for the max number of agents that was in the original list but that one got skipped ‚Ä¶ not part of a sinister plot but I overloooked it. want to do some other things with that limit sometime soon as well üôÇ ‚Ä¶ I'd like to see how the region and viewer performs with bigger numbers. Things go bad with many AVs for a variety of reasons ‚Ä¶ the server has more updates to send to more people, all wearing more scripts and AOs and HUDS [and] the viewer gets overwhelmed with too many complex avatars and too many textures in the download and graphics pipeline.‚Äù
SL Viewer
The Avatar Layer Limits RC viewer updated to version 3.7.29.301305 on April 28th, bringing it to code parity with the current release viewer. This RC allows users to wear up to 60 wearable layers (jackets, shirts, tattoo, alpha, etc.) in any combination ‚Äì so you can wear 60 tattoo layers with it an nothing else, if you want ‚Äì rather than being restricted to wearing a maximum of 5 of each type of layer.

Online / Offline Indicators
People are noticing that the group chat list (the list of group members in the Group panel), is now much slower to update as people's status changes (i.e. whether they are on-line or off-line). This is intentional, and comes as a result of the recent improvements made to group chat.
In particular, and as I reported in these pages as work on group chat commenced in 2014, the volume of people logging-in to and out of SL can generate a huge amount of updates for the group chat service (given your status has to be sent to every group of which you're a member, and to over member of that group who is online to update the group list in their viewer with your new status), meant that more time was being consumed by the group chat servers in handling these update messages than in handling actual messages. The fix for this problem means there is a natural delay in group list updates, as they are now processed differently to reduce the impact they have on message handling.
However, some people have started noticing that some group chat lists with 20+ members seem to take a very long time to update ‚Äì times of 5-10 minutes have been mentioned, and this is causing some confusion when seeking things like assistance from group owners / moderators (as they can appear to be logged-in long after they have logged-off). It's also bee reported that at times the list seems to get stuck with no updates until the group chat itself is closed and re-opened, although this appears to be somewhat intermittent.

0 Tulsa parent says TPS isn't going far enough to stop bullying after son stabbed with pencil
TULSA, Okla. - Quick facts:
Michelle Broomhall says their son has been bullied constantly at a Tulsa elementary school, and they were stabbed with a pencil recently.
They say students are not being punished enough for bullying.
The school district says they try to use a restorative process in dealing with potential bullying.
A Tulsa parent says their son is being bullied at Sequoyah Elementary, and they believe the Tulsa Public School District isn't doing enough to stop it.
Michelle Broomhall told FOX23 Monday that someone stabbed their son in the stomach and shoulder last week while they were in class.
They say the students who stabbed their son only received two days of in-school suspension.
They say the next day a friend of the student accused of stabbing their son jumped him, and they say the district never notified them
Broomhall says the bullying has been going on since their son was in the second grade. Now, they are in the fifth grade.
Broomhall says the boy who assaulted their son should have received harsher punishment.
Tulsa Public Schools says they take all bullying cases seriously, but they like to go with a different approach when discussing bullies' punishment:
‚ÄúWe have a focus on restorative practices that allow students to resolve conflict through dialogue. We also look for ‚Äòthird ways' to respond to behavioral issues, such as assigning community services, or writing apologies and reflections on the behavior. This keeps students in school while providing appropriate interventions and clear consequences.‚Äù
The district has not addressed why the fifth grader accused of stabbing Broomhall's son was placed in a pre-K classroom as punishment.

This one goes out to the janky robots. I don't mean the movie and TV robots that were a product of design limitations of their time and now seem hilariously dated, or robots that were cobbled together within the context of the series, like Homer's robot. And perfectly human androids don't count either, even though B4 was one of the lowest points in Star Trek Nemesis, a movie with plenty of low points to spare.
I mean the robots that were built out of cardboard. The true heroes of awful design. The bargain basement robots that flashed "low budget" in busted neon letters. This is an attempt to chronicle a few of the worst offenders, whether they were bad because of budget, because of poor grasp of design, or because the filmmakers couldn't be bothered to care. They are terrible, and we love (?) them.
The originator of bad movie robots
This is Q, the robot from The Master Mystery, a 1920 movie serial starring Harry Houdini. Yes, that Harry Houdini. There were robots on screen before this one, but no early on-screen robot was as incongruously designed as Q, who had a barrel in their pelvic area for no apparent reason. You might be saying to yourself, "come on, this was nearly a century ago!" Just remember: Metropolis came out in 1926 featuring the robotic Maria whose design is still iconic today.
Other robots had the front-junk-trunk problem, including Marvin the Paranoid Android in the original BBC Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy miniseries. The BBC, in general, has an uneven track record in robot production. The Cybermen and Daleks from Doctor Who do a lot with a little. The Robot ... not as much.
The nadir
Often regarded as one of the worst movies of all time, Robot Monster also features one of the laziest robots of all time, essentially a cheap gorilla costume crossed with a cheap astronaut costume. The 1953 movie was made in four days for $10,000. The titular robot, Ro-Man Extension XJ-2, is on a quest to destroy the last eight humans in the film. They do not succeed.
In the same realm of quality filmmaking is Robot vs. The Aztec Mummy, which certainly wins in the "descriptive title" department. We want to give the film's titular robot credit for sheer effort on costuming, aside from the incongruously placed human-head-within-its-head.
Big head bots
The 1954 movie Tobor the Great features a robot named Tobor who intends to become a spaceship pilot, but instead winds up befriending a young child and a kindly grandfather. This being the Cold War, the Russians are out to get the robot, but the bonds of friendship between machine and small human prevail.
Design-wise, Tobor is a classic case of the hilariously oversized shapes common to early cinematic robots. Moviemakers wanted to emulate the machines seen in Superman and the Mechanical Men. But the result was many clunky, too-tall designs meant to invoke size and scale but instead creating a head-to-body ratio unsustainable in a real android. It was just one of many bots to take on this motif in the 50s.
Bad robots in good movies
Welcome to the "one of these things is not like the other" section, were I'm talking about bad robots that appear alongside good robots. The worst offender, easily, is the Power Droid from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (also seen in Return of the Jedi, above). Standing alongside astromechs, protocol, and other cool types of droid, Power Droid was hopelessly clunky‚Äîand obviously a child or short person sitting under a plastic box with HVAC tubing for legs. C-3PO, R2-D2, and the Death Star droid worked because they seemed like robots. The Star Wars world worked because the aliens looked alien and the puppets were mostly realistic. But Power Droid a mistake. And they still made at least two action figures out of it.
There's also Lucifer, Count Baltar's assistant in the 1970s Battlestar Galactica. Compared to the excellent original Cylon design of original TV series, Lucifer is below Robby the Robot in design, a loose collection of parts that vaguely moves to resemble some sort of speech. This is a curious design choice in movie robots: Their designers give mouths to machines that don't need them just to make them look more human. Just think of C-3PO. In their case, it works: There's an empty cavity, rather than unmoving lips, and you see the sort of design they're aiming for. But Lucifer just has lights that blink creepily, which is ... something.
Lucifer wasn't the first lazily design robot where blinking lights stand in for speech. The trend continued with other low-budget TV robots, like Alpha 5 from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, who was not the most janky thing about that television series. Plus, Alpha 5 is sort of charming.
The Black Hole of bad robots
Not a lot of people find charm in The Black Hole. It was a naked attempt to cash in after Star Wars and nab some of that sweet, sweet robots-and-space-battles cash. But even though it was made by Disney, The Black Hole was... really messed up. (Spoilers for a 36-year-old movie): For instance, everyone ends up in Hell at the end, meaning you could, conceivably, say that Event Horizon copied this surprisingly dark film.
But The Black Hole had two adorable robots named B.O.B. and V.I.N.CENT. They are nakedly Star Wars-inspired, with just a bit of Disney thrown in (by that I mean cute robot eyes).
Even the S.T.A.R. style robots in the film work, in their own way. But then there's Maximilian. Maximilian is supposed to be the ultimate robotic villain, but its design begins and ends with, "make a robot tall, then do nothing else with him." Maximilian's parts don't move well and they seem to move forward mostly on wheel casters. It's sort of like watching a statue try to fight, only able to raise ineffective, rod-like hands.
I'll give Maximilian a little credit though. Their concept art made them look a whole lot cooler, so you can write off some of the problems to budgetary limitations and '70s effects.
Even more 'Star Wars' rip-offs
Star Wars cash-ins or not, BSG and The Black Hole have defenders ready to go to bat for either. Star Odyssey does not.
Star Odyssey was one of a handful of ripoffs of Star Wars to come out of Italy. It was directed by Alfonso Brescia, who made more than 51 cheapies across their 30-plus year film career. One of those, War of the Planets, had one of the best cheap evil computers ever‚Äîa bunch of lights on a spray painted cardboard box, which "inspired" Aqua Teen Hunger Force years later. But Star Odyssey is a worse movie because it's annoying on a variety of fronts. Specifically, there are two duck-like robots in love that will leave you questioning years of life decisions:
Their voices are simultaneously obnoxious and bored. Their personalities are despondently amorous. Star Odyssey was almost too bad for Mystery Science Theater 3000.
Then there's Message from Space, a bizarre Japanese take on Star Wars that went on to spawn a TV series despite some truly hideous robots, like one of the Beba models seen here in the movie, previewing years of live-action robots in Japanese children's shows.
Thsi wasn't just happening overseas. In the wake of Star Wars, two old franchises that inspired it came back to rip it off all over again, because time is a flat circle. There was Flash Gordon, a campy movie with a Queen soundtrack that achieved alright reviews and a cult following. There was also Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, a one-two movie-then-tv-show punch. It had TWIKI. Human face, no moving mouth, janky movements, and the voice of a grizzled Brooklyn plumber that didn't quite fit the design.
There are reasons I prefer Duck Dodgers. But perhaps one of the most naked Star Wars ripoffs is one of the least known. Ladies and gentlemen, via io9, here's the robot from a Texas wine infomercial called Holiday Race for Space.

The janky TV bots
That's Urkelbot. That's all you need to know about Urkelbot. Go home, Urkelbot.
But let's not talk about Urkelbot, part of Family Matters' race to the bottom from promising middle class sitcom to a show about Urkel and the family they harass. What I'm here to talk about is Gilligan's Island.
The robots visited the island. Ginger fell in love with one. Oh, and the castaways later returned to the island after their rescue. And robots returned. And the robots were evil. The only way to stop them was the world's greatest basketball team this side of Space Jam: The Harlem Globetrotters.
Now we need to talk about Star Trek. I'm not going to criticize the "androids look just like us" motif, because then I'd have to criticize the greatest on-screen androids, including the replicants from Blade Runner and Data and Lore from Star Trek: The Next Generation, even if that gives a pass to a lot of bad ones. But Star Trek wasn't innocent when it came to crappy robots, and I'm not talking about Lal, because "Data's Daughter" was a great episode with a lot to say about gender and personality as a construct. What I'm talking about is the episode where Kirk talked to a robotic probe named NOMAD and got it to commit suicide.
NOMAD lights up when talking. It moves when it talks, too. It looks like a bunch of spare parts lying around. NOMAD is the jankiest robot in the franchise.
You might think animation would fare better, since cartoon robots are not limited by real physics or the need to build a big robot suit. You might think wrong. Just look at H.E.R.B.I.E.
When Fantastic Four returned to the small screen in the late 1970s, the Human Torch was busy being developed into their own (never to come to fruition) TV show. So, needing a fourth member of the team, NBC opted not for another superhero, but for H.E.R.B.I.E., an ineffective android whose acronym stood for some iteration of "cynically kid friendly." The New Fantastic Four lasted one season. H.E.R.B.I.E. is still in the comics to this day, though.
H.E.R.B.I.E. was also an introduction to the annoying robotic sidekick. Many, many films and TV shows used this. JINX from Space Camp comes to mind.
Just throw some metal on the actors
The Robin Williams vehicle Bicentennial Man always gave off a creepy vibe though its Pinocchio-like tale of a robot who wants to become human. It falls into the Uncanny Valley of janky robots. It's too life-like, but also not enough. There's too much resemblance to a big actor, making it too hard to suspend disbelief. (It doesn't help that the movie is rather lazy in plot.)
The Andy Kaufmann movie Heartbeeps featured Kaufmann and Bernadette Peters as a robotic couple trying to realize the American dream. The movie was trashed on release, but the makeup effects got an Oscar nod. Today, those makeup effects are deeply unnerving.
That's not to say it's impossible to make a good pretend robot this way. Kryten from Red Dwarf comes to mind as a robotic character that took the budgetary limits, added some angles, and created what, at the least, was an interesting variation of the trope. The least interesting variation came in Superman III, where a machine turned people into robots.
The very worst
It's not easy to pick a loser from this bunch. Sure, Tobor is terrible, but had you heard of it prior to this article. The jankiest robot of all time must be from something that's still at least somewhat in the mind of genre fans. It should be from a production that had a few resources to work with but still came up with something awful. It should have been created by people who knew better and still came up short.
So, we have Box from Logan's Run.
The 1976 film actually looks a lot like Star Wars, at least on paper. It cost $9 million; Star Wars cost $13 million. Both relied on classically trained actors going through hard times who needed the work (Alec Guinnes for Star Wars, Peter Ustinov in the case of Logan's Run.) Both had to come up with futuristic settings on limited budgets. Say what you want to about the madness of latter-day George Lucas‚Äîback then they came up with R2-D2 and C-3PO, robots arguably as popular and familiar to multiple generations of children as Big Bird.
Logan's Run came up with this.
Box speaks for itself. Box is the alpha and the omega. Box is the jankiest robot.
A top FBI official with inside knowledge of Donald Trump's attempts to pressure James Comey to clear them in the Russia investigation has quietly been reassigned within the agency by Trump's handpicked FBI chief.
A senior FBI official who can reportedly verify that Donald Trump pressured former FBI Director James Comey to clear them in the ongoing investigation into Russian election interference was quietly reassigned by Trump's FBI director, according to an explosive new report by the Washington Post.
In a sudden and unexpected move, James Baker ‚Äî the FBI's top lawyer ‚Äî was just reassigned by FBI Director Christopher A. Wray. Baker told colleagues they will be ‚Äútaking on other duties at the FBI,‚Äù the Post reported Thursday night.
Wray was installed as Trump's chosen FBI director after Comey was fired.
Baker has served as the head of the FBI's Office of General Counsel for years, but now the transfer is occurring as special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation has secured several convictions and indictments of senior Trump campaign officials.
The Post notes that Baker is ‚Äúvery close‚Äù to Comey.
Previous reporting indicates that Baker is one of very few senior officials with whom Comey consulted after Trump leaned on them to clear their name in the Russia probe.
Vox reported that Baker, along with Comey chief of staff Jim Rybicki and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, were told about the encounter between Trump and Comey.
Comey has testified to Congress that Trump demanded that they show them loyalty, drop the investigation into Michael Flynn, and publicly clear Trump of involvement in the Russia scandal.
Comey refused to bend to Trump's pressure and was fired after.
Vox reporter Murry Waas said their source, a senior law enforcement official familiar with the Trump-Comey-Baker saga, told them that Baker ‚Äúhad more than one discussion‚Äù about Trump's reported attempts to coerce Comey before firing him. Their source also said Baker ‚Äúalmost certainly made extensive notes about those deliberations.‚Äù
Baker has been a target of Trump's right-wing media allies. Circa, the news service operated by the pro-Trump Sinclair network of television stations, claimed that Baker was a ‚Äúsuspect‚Äù in an investigation of Department of Justice leaks.
Breitbart, run by former Trump campaign chairperson and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, amplified Circa's report, highlighting claims that the investigation was ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù in nature.
Trump has been known to take political cues from their media allies. They have repeatedly pushed issues ‚Äì no matter how crackpot ‚Äì after they were featured on Fox News, and is fond of repeating disproven conspiracies circulating on the right.
The latest news adds another piece of critical evidence suggesting that Trump was attempting to obstruct justice while the FBI and other entities within the government were trying to get to the bottom of Russia's actions with the Trump campaign.
And with each new move, Trump is giving investigators even more to work with.
Two pilots of the Algerian airline Air Algerie were suspended from work after allowing a child to navigate their airplane. The incident occurred during the domestic flight in Algeria. The boy, whose identity is not specified, was allowed to sit on the captain's seat and for some time to fly the plane under the guidance of the pilots. Before the flight the pilots arranged a tour for the 10-year-old child on the liner.
For the boy organized such entertainment in the framework of the project to support orphans. It is known that the young Algerian themselves dreams of becoming a pilot.
One of the pilots Air Algerie confirmed to reporters that they and their colleague allowed the child to fly the plane. This is a serious violation of the rules of civil aviation. As a result, the men were suspended from work while the investigation was being conducted. Whether they are threatened with criminal prosecution is unknown.
Air Algerie is the national airline of Algeria with its head office in the Immeuble El-Djazair in Algiers. With flights operating from Houari Boumedienne Airport, Air Alg√©rie operates scheduled international services to 39 destinations in 28 countries in Europe, North America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, as well as domestic services to 32 airports. The airline is a member of the International Air Transport Association, the Arab Air Carriers Organization, and of the African Airlines Association (AFRAA) since 1968.
Residents say the City must fix the burst underground pipes. File photo: Jack Lestrade.
Cape Town ‚Äì The Daily Voice has tracked down the City of Cape Town's top two water wasters, who claim the City is the biggest culprit of them all. On Tuesday, Cape Town mayor Patricia De Lille named and shamed 100 residences that used the most water in Cape Town. The City's dam levels were standing at an alarming 23 percent on Monday. They warned that if dam levels dipped below the 10 percent mark, water shedding would be implemented. The City is also looking at intensifying the level 3B water restrictions, where all garden watering will be stopped.
On Wednesday the Daily Voice went to Haywood Road, Crawford, where the ‚ÄúNo.1 water waster‚Äù was said to have used a whopping 702 000 litres of water in just one month. But we found that only two old people lived at this particular residence, there was no garden and the pool was nearly empty.
A pensioner, who lives at the property, blamed their high bill on a burst water pipe last month. ‚ÄúI don't know how we could have used so much water when we are trying to save as much water as we can,‚Äù they said.
‚ÄúWe have stopped using the dishwasher and placed buckets in the sink so we can reuse the water for some pot plants we have. We haven't filled the pool and it is close to empty by now and I have no garden as my entire yard is paved.
‚ÄúIn the first week of February, I had a leakage problem in my front yard and it was running for an entire day. When the council finally came out the man told me with a laugh, ‚Äòyour property, your problem'.
‚ÄúI had to let my insurance company send someone out to fix the problem. They also had to fix the piping in the ground because apparently my water meter was running down fast, but I had nothing running in the house
‚ÄúI am a pensioner and have been living here for the past 29 years and I have never received such an exorbitant bill ever.‚Äù
Number two on the water wasters' list is a residence in Manenberg Avenue, Manenberg, whose meter showed a massive 655 000 litres of water was used last month.
Manenberg Avenue is made up of maisonettes and blocks of flats. There are no swimming pools or gardens, but plenty of leaking pipes.
Resident Martha Thuysma, 64, said their water meter is so faulty they literally turn their water off to stop their house from flooding.
‚ÄúAt night I have to put my water off because of this faulty water meter,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúWe all have the same problem here, faulty meters and leaking pipes from the bathroom.
‚ÄúIf I do not put my water off at night I will wake up to a house flooded with water. It has happened many times already.
‚ÄúMy daughter called how many times to town's office, but nothing. Hulle praat so van (They talk about) water saving, but they don't come to fix when there is water leaking. I'm still paying a bill of R2 000 because of leakages; I'm afraid to see what the bill will be now.‚Äù
Another resident in Manenberg Avenue, Badroeniesa Ely, 55, said they live alone, but received a water bill of almost R5 000.
Ely said. ‚ÄúI live alone; my husband and children are dead. I work three times a week and the rest of the time I look after my sick sister-in-law. I literally only come home to sleep. Nou waar kan ek so klomp water gebruik het? (So how can I be using so much water?)‚Äù
The other water wasters who make up the top five on the list are: Boundary Road, Lansdowne, who used 557 000 litres; Upper Hillwood Road, Bishop's Court who used 554 000 litres; and a Bishop's Court residence in Norwich Drive who used 500 000 litres.
The City of Cape Town did not respond to Daily Voice queries by Wednesday night, but on Wednesday morning, while speaking to Aden Thomas on Heart FM, De Lille's spokesperson Zara Nicholson admitted some people were wrongfully blamed.
They said officials would now be sent to all high consumers to get to the heart of the matter.
‚ÄúOn 28 February, a report came through that an underground leak has been found in Haywood Road,‚Äù they explained. ‚Äú B y t h e t i m e d a t a wa s released on Monday, officials thought this was correct. It's something that is being looked into. Officials will be going out to all those houses to see for any underground leaks.‚Äù

Copies for publishers and reviewers.
Play testers in multiple cities where you want to get each group a copy of the game.
Benefits
Bulk discounts as if they were going to the same address.
Crafter points - you get them all!
Accolades - BOFs count toward sales accolades.
You don't have to spend a month in your basement individually packing and shipping boxes.
You can include multiple copies per order, even of other games you made, so you can use other printables and parts as perks in your crowd funding campaigns.
How Does It Work?
The reason it took us so long to build this was that we went through many iterations trying to make it as easy as possible. We think we've made it pretty simple. Take a look at the process through a series of screen shots.
Step 1: Download a sample spreadsheet.
Step 2: Fill in the names and addresses and what you want to send to each customer. Save it as a CSV file.
Step 3: Upload the spreadsheet.
Step 4: We'll calculate the shipping on each of your games.
Step 5: Verify that everything looks good.
Step 6: Sign off that you have verified everything.
Step 7: The Game Crafter will have a look at the order, and ask questions or make suggestions if we can save you more money or frustration.
Step 8: Pay as soon as you're ready.
That's all folks!
We realize we could make this a couple steps shorter by just going straight from upload to the payment screen. However, we found in testing that users liked the ability to look everything over before going to the payment. We also know from experience that we can often offer advice on bulk orders that will either save you money, or at the very least save some frustration if we catch a problem that you didn't.
So if you need to place a bulk order in the future, consider using our new Bulk Order Fulfillment system. Enjoy!
The New York Police Department showed an anti-Muslim film ‚Äúon a continuous loop‚Äù for between three months and one year of training at its COBRA (Chemical, Ordinance, Biological, and Radiological) Unit, which provides terrorism awareness training.
According to the New York Times, the documentary The Third Jihad showed Muslim terrorists shooting Christians in the head, executed children covered by sheets and a fake photograph of an Islamic flag flying above the White House. One of those interviewed in the film says that ‚ÄúIslamism is like cancer.‚Äù
News of the film's use by the NYPD first broke in January 2011. A police official at the time claimed that it had only been shown ‚Äúa couple of times.‚Äù
But documents (PDF) obtained by the Brennan Center for Justice revealed that the film was ‚Äúplayed on a continuous loop during the sign in, medical and administrative process‚Äù of the training. It was not used during the lecture portion of the training, though, only as an ‚Äúintermission filler.‚Äù
At least 1,489 police officers saw the film.
‚ÄúSomebody exercised some terrible judgment,‚Äù New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told the Associated Press. ‚ÄúAs soon as they found out about it, they stopped it.‚Äù
Staff at the COBRA Unit said they obtained the video from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. But the identity of that DHS agent who provided the film remains a mystery. The DHS said the film was not an authorized to be used or distributed by the department.
The film was eventually pulled after police officers complained that it was offensive.
‚ÄúIt's clearly a propaganda, anti-Muslim film,‚Äù said Linda Sarsour, a member of the Muslim-American Civil Liberties Coalition. ‚ÄúIt's overly dramatic, piecing together things out of context and threading it together to make this very false narrative about Muslim Americans.‚Äù
The film was created by the Clarion Fund, a group tied to the Israeli orthodox organization Aish Hatorah, according to Think Progress. The group has received millions of dollars in donations and has produced multiple anti-Muslim films, including Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West and Iranium.

Violent protests continued for the second day running in Atteridgeville and Mamelodi in Tshwane, where residents are protesting against the naming of former cabinet minister, Thoko Didiza, as the city's mayoral candidate for the African National Congress (ANC).
A live report from EWN early Tuesday said there were at least three vehicles ‚Äì a bus and two trucks ‚Äì that were on fire in Atteridgeville, where roads were blocked with burning tyres. Shops were also looted.
Residents said they were not happy with Didiza and wanted mayor Kgosientso Ramokgopa to remain in their position.
However, Ramokgopa on Tuesday distanced themselves from people protesting in their name, saying they were backing Didiza to take over.
‚ÄúWe (are) calling on law enforcement agencies to ensure we get a grip on the situation,‚Äù said the outgoing Tshwane mayor who is an ANC member.
The government on Tuesday condemned the violence in Tshwane in which as many as 19 buses have been torched.
‚ÄúGovernment condemns in the strongest terms the outbreak of violence and destruction of property which has occurred in areas in the City of Tshwane,‚Äù said a statement issued early Tuesday by the Government Communication and Information Systems (GCIS).
Late on Monday the Democratic Alliance (DA) called for calm.
‚ÄúTonight I call for calm in the City of Tshwane after the violence that erupted in Atteridgeville, Mamelodi, Soshanguve and Hammanskraal today ‚Äì over the ANC's imposed Mayoral Candidate, Thoko Didiza ‚Äì escalated this evening,‚Äù said Solly Msimanga, the DA Mayoral Candidate for Tshwane.
Msimanga said the DA condemns the factions within the ANC that are fanning the flames of violence.
‚ÄúI challenge ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe to intervene and stop the ANC infighting spilling further onto the streets of our City,‚Äù said Msimanga.
However, the ANC said the violence was not of its own doing but an act of criminality.

Parents: What is your message to parents who don't vaccinate their kids? Share your video or written perspective on CNN iReport.
(CNN) To call the news surrounding vaccinations a "debate" is misleading. The scientific and medical consensus is clear: Vaccinations are safe, and they work.
But there are many who choose -- for their own reasons -- to disregard the recommendations to vaccinate and exercise their right to not do so.
The controversy, then, comes when the anti-vaccination movement gets large enough to reverse advances in the reduction or elimination of certain diseases.
That's what is happening with the measles. How bad can it be? Here are some guideposts to the issue in context:
What is the current situation?
In simplest terms, as of January 30, there were 102 cases of measles reported across 14 states.
The majority of these cases are related to one outbreak linked to Disneyland in California.
Is a 102 cases a lot?
Last year, there were 644 cases of measles reported.
This year's pace is striking: One month into the new year, the number of measles cases is nearly one-sixth of last year's total.
A closer look makes this year's measles outbreak look even worse. Last year's 644 measles cases is an outlier compared to the previous decade. The number of measles cases in 2014 was the highest since 2000.
Between 2001 and 2011, the median number of measles cases reported per year was 62. (During that period, the highest number of cases in a single year was 220, and the lowest was 37).
Here's the glass-half-empty view: So far this year, there are already more cases of measles than during an entire typical year. Those are the words of Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general and director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
Last year saw the greatest number of measles cases since 2000. Will 2015 surpass that mark? From @CDCgov pic.twitter.com/n1Loj5i4uJ ‚Äî Mariano Castillo (@marianoCNN) February 2, 2015
Is this uptick in measles cases unprecedented?
No, this is not the first time the United States has witnessed an uptick in measles cases since the invention of the measles vaccine.
A brief history of measles in the United States, according to the CDC:
Before the introduction of a live measles vaccine in 1963, the average yearly number of measles cases was 549,000. (Nearly 500 deaths per year were attributed to measles).
Once the measles vaccine was introduced (it was a one-dose shot), there was a huge drop in measles cases.
Then, between 1989 and 1991, there was a resurgence in measles cases. There were 55,000 cases and 123 deaths reported during that period.

Those getting sick were mostly unvaccinated children. But there were also people who had the vaccine and were getting the disease anyway.
In 1989, the medical community's recommendation was updated to recommend a two-dose vaccination regimen.
The use of two doses was effective. In 2000, endemic measles was declared "eliminated" from the United States.
What is at stake here?
It is a pretty big deal that the United States can say it eliminated measles. This doesn't mean that measles doesn't exist here, but that there is not a constant presence of it in an area.
There is the risk that measles could re-establish itself in the United States.
Schuchat, the assistant surgeon general, told reporters the spike in measles cases is troubling.
JUST WATCHED Obama: Vaccinate your kids Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama: Vaccinate your kids 02:10
"This worries me and I want to do everything possible to prevent measles from getting a foothold in the United States and becoming endemic again," they said.
The CDC points out that people who refuse to vaccinate usually live in the same community. When measles finds its way into these communities, outbreaks are more likely to occur, and controlling the disease becomes harder.
Measles are not a virus that Americans typically spend time worrying about, because for a long time it has not been prevalent. But it is a serious disease. It is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air.
Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat.
"This is not a problem with the measles vaccine not working," Schuchat said. "This is a problem of the measles vaccine not being used."
Why do people choose not to vaccinate?
The research on the effectiveness of the measles vaccine is well-documented. But anecdotes have a powerful sway.
The anti-vaccination crowd got a boost when a British study alleged a link between autism and childhood vaccines. The study was later retracted, and called an "elaborate fraud" by a leading medical publication.
One Arizona cardiologist, Dr. Jack Wolfson, has become a face of the anti-vaccination movement, because they are a doctor who refuses to vaccinate their children.
"It's not my responsibility to inject my child with chemicals," Wolfson told CNN's Erin Burnett.
JUST WATCHED doctors have heated debate over vaccination Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Watch doctors have heated debate over vaccination 04:58
The bottom line, of course, is that no matter what the recommendations are, no person or institution can force people to vaccinate their children. Schools and other institutions often have immunization requirements, but there are ways to opt out for religious or personal reasons.
During the last school year, 3.3% of California kindergartners -- about 18,200 -- were allowed to skip vaccinations , according to the CDC. The vast majority of exemptions were due to personal beliefs.
Journalists at Silk, a platform for creating data visualizations, took California Kindergarten vaccination rate data and found 133 school districts with vaccination compliance rates at 80% or lower.
Why do I keep hearing this being called a debate?
Scientifically, there is no debate. The measles vaccine is effective. Most of those who contract measles, unsurprisingly, are those who are unvaccinated.
But a conversation about the current measles outbreak brings up other ideas -- on personal and religious freedoms, skepticism of scientific findings, reach of government regulations -- that are inherently political. And here is where the arguments arise.
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told radio host Laura Ingraham that they are "not anti-vaccine at all," but added "most of them should be voluntary."
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said they vaccinate their children to protect "their health and the public health," but that they understand that "parents need to have some measure of choice as well."
The science is clear; which policies to craft with that knowledge is what remains to be discussed.
The best way to defend is to attack, seems as an effective tactic carried out by the Syrian Arab Army in its war against the NATO backed Al-Qaeda FSA fighters aka Wahhabi Sex Jihadists who seek to ‚Äòdemocratize' the country Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Somalia among many others were ‚Äòdemocratized'.
The offensive SAA troops are carrying out in most of the strongholds of these terrorist groups throughout the country are bearing fruits and losses inflicted among the terrorists are heavy enough to the extent that mad dogs at the NATO headquarters are considering to interfere directly to save what's left of their best asset and investment in Al-Qaeda fighters.
Among the areas cleansed by the SAA in the past week, were very strategically important sites in Homs countryside towards the borders with Lebanon, Idleb and Aleppo countryside towards the borders with Turkey and in Daraa in the south towards the borders with Jordan, while surrounding and exterminating the remnants of terrorist groups within localities around major cities. For the past 2 years, the Syrian state was trying to give another chance to those misguided to drop the weapons and get back to their normal lives, by keeping always corridors for terrorists in targeted areas to allow their retreat and rethink what they got themselves involved in. The Syrian Armed Forces sustained heavy losses on the hopes of sparing lives among the misguided, but seems this is not the case anymore, especially that the majority of the terrorists are not Syrians, SAA is now surrounding, besieging and exterminating these fanatic Islamist not Islamic herds of foreign backed evil powers.
Damascus countryside witnessed a few confrontations where the SAA delivered huge blows to the core concentrations of the terrorists thinking by attacking in large numbers they can still win the war not knowing that by attacking in large numbers they just lose in large numbers, like what happened in Jdeidat Al-Fadhl in Damascus countryside to the south of the capital Damascus where more than 500 terrorists were terminated in about 3 hours, and what happened in the Otaybah area near Damascus International Airport, as you will see in the following report by the Syrian Ikhbariya News Channel, with English subtitles.
Major gains in Homs countryside, and specifically around Al-Qussayr will cut the supplies in men and weapons off the terrorists and free the SAA to focus on uprooting the current wave of the Muslim Brotherhood aggression against civilization and humanity, meanwhile the NATO propagandists aka mainstream media are trying to redo Iraq's WMDs farce and shift the Sheeple in the west to their virtual reality.

There have been a few attempts to bring Jaws into the realm of video games and none of them have been particularly well received. Is the idea of turning ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù into a video game an inherently flawed one? Playing as a killer shark sounds like a cool idea, so why hasn't it worked?
Perhaps previous developers didn't realize that the essence of Jaws could only be truly captured in one format: text adventure. Think about it. One of the most defining elements of Steven Spielberg's movie is that the shark is rarely seen. In a text adventure game you only see still frames and, if you're lucky, one of them might be a shark. It's the most perfect adaptation of the film yet.
You can check out ‚ÄúJaws: The Text Adventure‚Äù right here. The game is developed by Matt Round for UsVsTh3m. Check it out, it won't take long and it has a few good laughs in it.
Last week, Kurdish authorities rescued 16-year-old Marlin Stivani Nivarlain at the behest of the Swedish government. Like something out of an SNL sketch, they had emigrated to northern Iraq because their boyfriend joined ISIS and they thought it would be fun. It wasn't‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt. ‚Äú¬Ä¬úIn the house, we didn't‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt have anything, no electricity, no water,‚Äù¬Ä¬ù they told a Kurdistan news channel, ‚Äú¬Ä¬únothing.‚Äù¬Ä¬ù I‚Äù¬Ä¬ôm reminded of the complaining millennials who regretted joining ISIS after they realized their iPods don‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt work there (also a comedy sketch). These aren't‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt just some esoteric examples of a tiny minority of young people who go astray. It's what's happening to the Western world. The assumption that we suck is forcing us to abandon everything and replace it with‚Ä¶shit.
‚Äú¬Ä¬úMove over and let us replace you‚Äù¬Ä¬ù is a common mantra from young liberals. ‚Äú¬Ä¬úFull communism,‚Äù¬Ä¬ù ‚Äú¬Ä¬úEnd capitalism,‚Äù¬Ä¬ù and ‚Äú¬Ä¬úEnd white supremacy‚Äù¬Ä¬ù are also big. They‚Äù¬Ä¬ôre interesting concepts at first glance until you realize they‚Äù¬Ä¬ôre basing all this on the assumption that No. 2 is even in the same universe as No. 1. Marita Koch did the 400m in 47.6 seconds back in 1985. Sanye Richards is second-best, but she's a full second behind Koch, which is a lifetime in sprinting. It's unlikely Marita's world record will ever be broken. The modern left is essentially a bunch of handicapped teenagers in wheelchairs barking at Koch to get the hell off the track‚Äù¬Ä¬îonly way more dangerous.
‚Äú¬Ä¬úLetting the left run the show is like when I have ‚Äú¬Ä¬òkids day‚Äù¬Ä¬ô at home and let my children do whatever they want.‚Äù¬Ä¬ù
In 2008, Italian performance artist Pippa Bacca decided we had the Middle East all wrong. Muslims aren't‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt maniacal rapists with no respect for human life. They‚Äù¬Ä¬ôre angels sent from God to love us. To prove this they began hitchhiking from Italy to Turkey while wearing a wedding dress. Shortly after they arrived in Istanbul, Bacca was raped and strangled to death. Authorities found their naked corpse thrown in the dirt like a piece of garbage. ‚Äú¬Ä¬úTrust is a very human factor,‚Äù¬Ä¬ù Pippa's sister said of the mission. ‚Äú¬Ä¬úShe believed that to understand people, you had to get to know them.‚Äù¬Ä¬ù That's precisely the problem. They don‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt know them. All they know is an idea of them and they made up that idea in their own mind.
Before millennial activist Kayla Mueller was taken hostage and eventually bombed to death in a drone strike, they were a proud American feminist who wasn't‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt going to sit by and let injustice happen on their watch. ‚Äú¬Ä¬úFor as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,‚Äù¬Ä¬ù they told their friends and family as they set out to rescue Syria, ‚Äú¬Ä¬úsomething we just accept.‚Äù¬Ä¬ù Progressivism hasn't‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt empowered these women. It's endangered their lives. It's made them so unassailable, they proudly walk into war zones and demand everyone behave themselves. Is Merkel's Germany the future we have to look forward to if we ‚Äú¬Ä¬úmove over‚Äù¬Ä¬ù?
Jessica Buchanan thinks women need to understand their limits and is much more likely to insist charity begins at home before returning to Africa. This is because, after committing to help Somalia deal with their land-mine problem in 2011, they were kidnapped by pirates. They refused a ransom offer of $1.5M because they‚Äù¬Ä¬ôre idiots and three months later, two dozen Navy SEALs had to parachute into the small town of Adow to rescue them Shortly before the rescue, all Buchanan could think about was how stupid they were to jeopardize their own life at such a young age and how sad it would be if they never had kids. Turns out the patriarchy isn't‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt so horrible after all.
My very favorite example of this suicidal hubris happened in 2010 when Amanda Kijera traveled to Haiti to prove women's organizations were lying about the horrific rape stats there. Like Pippa, they were promptly raped. What's amazing about Kijera's experience is it didn't‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt change their mind. Marlin begged their mother to get them back to Sweden. Mueller apologized profusely for subjecting their parents to such ‚Äú¬Ä¬úsuffering.‚Äù¬Ä¬ù Jessica wouldn't‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt consider going back to Africa. But Kijera remained unwavering in their blame of the white male patriarchy. In a formal statement describing the experience, they said:
I pleaded with them to honor my commitment to Haiti, to them as a brother in the mutual struggle for an end to our common oppression, but to no avail. They didn't‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt care‚Ä¶. They didn't‚Äù¬Ä¬ôt care that I was a Malcolm X scholar‚Ä¶. Black men have every right to the anger they feel in response to their position in the global hierarchy, but their anger is misdirected‚Ä¶. Women are not the source of their oppression; oppressive policies and the as-yet unaddressed white patriarchy which still dominates the global stage are.

New Jersey is on its way to becoming the first American state that bans the declawing of cats.
A bill sponsored by Assemblyman Troy Singleton was recently passed through an Assembly committee stating that the medical practice of onychetomy would be considered animal cruelty, with the exception of special health reasons like the removal of tumors or gangrene.
‚ÄúDeclawing is a barbaric practice that more often than not is done for the sake of convenience rather than necessity,‚Äù according to Singleton's statement after the hearing. ‚ÄúMany countries worldwide acknowledge the inhumane nature of declawing, which causes extreme pain to cats. It's time for New Jersey to join them.‚Äù
RELATED: Dogs Can Now Join NYC Diners at Outdoor Tables, Say New Rules
Animal welfare organizations oppose onychetomy because it's a painful procedure that is typically done to save furniture while many cats start displaying physical and mental complications in the years following the operation. Over 20 other countries in the world already have declawing bans because it's considered animal cruelty.
Some pet owners and projects opposed the bill because they believe that the reasons behind such an act is between an animal caregiver and their veterinarian.
However studies show that declawed cats have increased chances of being relinquished to shelters ‚Äì and thus euthanasia ‚Äì because of behavioral tendencies that follow declawing, such as soiling the carpet and increased aggression.

But the film remains in development
There's good and bad news this morning for anyone following the tortuous and slow development of Neuromancer. The good news is that the adaptation of William Gibson's cyberpunk classic is still out there and has just secured some new funding. The bad news is that the long-attached Vincenzo Natali (Cube, Splice) is no longer directing. And with them has gone the Gibson-approved screenplay that was supposed to have been cracked.
The UK-based GFM films remain in play on the project, and the company has now partnered with the Chinese C2M Media Group for co-financing and further development. Producer Lucas Foster (Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Man On Fire) is currently in talks with unspecified new writers and a new director.
Published in 1984 (two years after Blade Runner, which, when they saw it, almost caused them to stop writing), William Gibson's book was part of the vanguard of the cyberpunk movement.
The story involves junkie hacker Case, who, as punishment for some ill-advised thievery, has had their nervous system sabotaged by a mycotoxin that prevents them from "jacking in" to cyberspace. He's offered a cure by shady ex-military spook Armitage, provided they participate in a none-more-secret mission against the powerful Tessier-Ashpool family and the sinister A.I. Wintermute. Along the way they encounter post-human icons like the technologically modified assassin Molly and the bodiless consciousness Dixie the Flatline.
Natali first got the film project up and running in 2010. A flurry of activity in 2012 saw Matrix / Transformers producer Lorenzo Di Bonaventura come aboard, and interest from Mark Wahlberg and Liam Neeson in the roles of, respectively, Case and Armitage. But the last update from Natali was in 2013, in which they explained that the screenplay had been the comparatively easy part, but funding remained a sticking point. Di Bonaventura, meanwhile, confirmed to Empire last December that they had left the project behind.
Everything Natali ever said about Neuromancer sounded reassuringly as if the project was creatively in the right hands - but there was no money. Now it seems the money has arrived but the creative team is completely changing.
‚ÄúWilliam Gibson's books have been very prescient on the topic of Super Intelligence," says Foster, "which people variously call 'Machine Intelligence' or 'A.I.'. As we surrender more and more of our thinking and imagining... we lose something important and tangible in ourselves. Neuromancer tells the story of that (near) future.‚Äù
Let's hope that isn't the behind-the-scenes story of the movie too.
Story highlights Three 20-year-olds create alternate site that lets people search for health care
Programmers built Health Sherpa in three days for "hundreds of dollars"
Site does not let users actually sign up for coverage
It was built in response to problems that have plagued Healthcare.gov site
How hard is it to create a website to help people get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act?
For three 20-year-old programmers in San Francisco, it took about three days' worth of work.
Spurred by the problems that have surrounded the rollout of the official HeathCare.gov site, the trio created an alternative, Health Sherpa , quickly and cheaply. At first glance, it looks like a triumph of tech-startup nimbleness over government inefficiency.
George Kalogeropoulos, who created the site along with Ning Liang and Michael Wasser, said all three of them had tried using the government website to get insurance.
"We were surprised to see that it was actually fairly difficult to use HealthCare.gov to find and understand our options," they told CNN. "Given that the data was publicly available, we thought that it made a lot of sense to take the data that was on there and just make it easy to search through and view available plans."

The result is a bare-bones site that lets users enter their zip code, plus details about their family and income, to find suggested plans in their area.
"The Health Sherpa is a free guide that makes it easier to find and sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. We only use carefully vetted, publicly available data," the site reads. "The Health Sherpa is not affiliated with any lobby, trade group or government agency and has no political agenda."
The Sherpa are an ethnic group in Nepal, some of whom have long served as guides for people climbing Mount Everest and other mountains in the Himalayas. The name has come to be used generically for any kind of guide or mentor.
Of course, it's not fair to compare the creation of Health Sherpa to the rollout of the more complicated government ACA site, which everyone from President Obama on down has acknowledged as a horribly botched affair.
For one, you can't actually use Heath Sherpa to sign up for coverage. The site states that it's for research purposes only, and that users must verify the premiums and subsidies they find there with state health care exchanges, insurance companies or on HealthCare.gov itself.
"It isn't a fair apples-to-apples comparison," Kalogeropoulos said. "Unlike Healthcare.gov, our site doesn't connect to the IRS, DHS, and various state exchanges and authorities. Furthermore, we're using the government's data, so our site is only possible because of the hard work that the Healthcare.gov team has done."
But it does cast light on the difference between what can be done by a small group of experts, steeped in Silicon Valley's anything-is-possible mentality, and a massive government project in which politics and bureaucracy seem to have helped create an unwieldy mess.
Creating the original Sherpa site took three days and cost "several hundred dollars," according to Kalogeropoulos. The three programmers have continued fine-tuning the site as its popularity has grown. In less than a week, the site has had almost 200,000 unique visitors and over half a million page views, they said.
"We've heard from people of all ages and walks of life, and thousands of people have reached out to us directly via email, phone, and Twitter to thank us to and to suggest features and request improvements," they said. "Tens of thousands of people have clicked through to buy a specific plan, suggesting that we are achieving our goal: helping people find a health insurance plan."
Bowling Brawl Ends With Bowling Ball To The Face
There are rules in bowling that involve something other than wearing silly shirts and shoes and getting drunk.
Following an alleged bowling etiquette violation, two groups of bowlers at the Rocklin AMF Lanes in Rocklin, California got into a fight.
As six people battled it out, one man felt they had to escalate things. We're talking about unchecked aggression here, dude.
Ryan Scott David allegedly hit another man in the face with a 16-pound bowling ball, knocking out one of their teeth. It is unknown if they were then allowed a second shot to try and pick up the spare.
The unnamed victim, who was in a world of pain, was taken to the hospital where doctors attempted to reattach their tooth while also treating them for other facial injuries.
As for David, was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and is being held on $35,000 bail. Unless they get it soon, they will not be rolling on Shabbos.

Cincinnati has added about 1,000 new people since the decennial census in 2010, according to new estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The modest increase comes from two consecutive years of population gains that followed an immediate downward revision after the 2010 Census. The increase also means that just Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton were the only big cities (more than 50,000 people) in Ohio to post gains.
Columbus and Cincinnati, meanwhile, were the only big cities to post population gains for the past two years.
The population estimates are derived using the 2010 Census as a baseline and then factoring in new permitted residential construction and mobile homes, and subtracting out the estimated number of homes lost each year. As a result, all of the annual estimates should come with a grain of salt.
With that said, Dayton's population gains appear to be an anomaly, while the increases in Columbus and Cincinnati appear to be more rooted. In any case, the news for Ohio's big cities is not good as the rest all lost population, especially those in the northeastern part of the state.
Columbus continues to stand out from the rest of Ohio's big cities in terms of its population trends. In this latest estimate release, Columbus posted the fifteenth largest numeric population gain of any municipality in America; and it comes on the heels of equally impressive gains in prior years.
Some observers, however, would attribute some of the gains in Columbus to its unusually large municipal boundaries that include what would be far suburbs in other Ohio regions.
While Columbus has been growing by about 1.5% annually over the past several years, Cincinnati has been growing annually by about 0.25%.
When compared with other peer cities, Cincinnati's gains look even more tepid.
Of fifteen other cities competitive with Cincinnati, the city bested only five of them in terms of population growth, while being significantly outperformed by most all others. In this comparison, even Ohio's best performer ‚Äì Columbus ‚Äìfares only reasonably well against the field.
For Cincinnati's peer cities, national trends appear to hold true. Southern cities continue to grow at the fastest clip, but their growth rates are leveling off. In our comparison, Austin, Atlanta and Tampa have all experienced significant declines in annual population growth since the 2010 Census. Charlotte has also experienced a similar trend, but appears to be holding steady more so than its Sun Belt peers.
Meanwhile, while many Midwestern cities continue to lose population, they are doing so at a slower rate or have stopped the losses entirely.
As we previously examined on UrbanCincy, the Cincinnati region continues to grow by about 0.4% annually. The City of Cincinnati's 2013 gain represents approximately 12.5% of the total regional population growth, and half of Hamilton County's increase last year.
In a nutshell, Cincinnati is over performing regionally, but under performing amongst its peers. If Cincinnati were growing as fast as Charlotte or Austin, the city would be adding around 9,000 new people every year.
From the U.S. Courts: Bankruptcy Filings Up 34 Percent over Last Fiscal Year
Bankruptcy cases filed in federal courts for fiscal year 2009 totaled 1,402,816, up 34.5 percent over the 1,042,993 filings reported for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2008, according to statistics released today by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
The federal Judiciary's fiscal year is the 12-month period ending September 30. The bankruptcies reported today are for October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009.
...
For the 12-month period ending September 30, 2009, business filings totaled 58,721, up 52 percent from the 38,651 business filings in the 12-month period ending September 30, 2008. Non-business filings totaled 1,344,095, up 34 percent from the 1,004,342 non-business bankruptcy filings in September 2008.

A homeless man charged with setting a fire that brought down a bridge on Atlanta's heavily traveled Interstate 85 was smoking crack cocaine at the time, a court document indicated Saturday.
Basil Eleby, 39, was arraigned on charges of first-degree arson and criminal damage to property. Eleby, who has a string of previous drug and assault arrests, according to Fulton County jail records, was held on $200,000 bond.
There were no deaths or injuries in the explosion and fire, but the bridge collapse Thursday severed the vital roadway that runs north-south through downtown Atlanta. The interstate carries 250,000 vehicles daily, Georgia transportation commissioner Russell McMurry told USA TODAY.
Deputy Insurance Commissioner Jay Florence earlier said two other people, Sophia Bruner and Barry Thomas, had been charged with criminal trespass.
‚ÄúWe believe they were together when the fire was set and Eleby is the one who set the fire,‚Äù Florence told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Eleby told officers that they encountered the two defendants beneath the bridge and "discussed smoking crack cocaine" but in the end decided ‚Äúhe would consume the drugs by himself‚Äù and ‚Äúleft the area before the fire started,‚Äù according to a criminal warrant presented to the magistrate court.
In the same warrant, obtained by the Journal-Constitution, officials said Thomas told them they saw Eleby place a chair on top of a shopping cart, reach under the shopping cart and ignite it.
Florence would not discuss how the fire was started or why, saying those details would be released as the investigation progresses.

Two weeks ago peasants in Wukan, a fishing village in the prosperous southern Chinese province of Guangdong, took over their village, throwing out local leaders. Because of long unanswered grievances, they risked their lives, barricading roads into the village and facing down the police. Their central concern was the sale of collectively owned village land to property developers, which has impoverished most residents while enriching their leaders.
As the Wukan protests evolved into an international media event, a provincial party official, under pressure from Beijing, stepped in and swiftly negotiated a truce acceptable to the villagers. This week Prime Minister Wen Jiabao asserted that ‚ÄúChina can no longer sacrifice farmers' land rights for the sake of reducing the cost of urbanization and industrialization.‚Äù
Once again China's leadership has succeeded in the complex task of managing social unrest. The eye of the world is now shifting away.
This is a serious mistake. Like China's leadership, the world should continue to play close attention to Wukan and to the tens of thousands of incidents of rural unrest that occur each year in China, the vast majority resulting from land grabs. Why? Because what happens to China's peasants is crucial to our collective future.

China's rural population is at the bottom of the global commodity chains of both Chinese and transnational corporations. Unhindered by regulations, these companies utilize China's land and rural labor for the environmentally and socially unsustainable production of goods consumed the world over. While consumers everywhere benefit from inexpensive products and corporate profits, the real costs are borne by China's most vulnerable.
FARGO-A restaurant opening downtown late this year will be a familiar name in the neighborhood-it's long been in business just three blocks away.
Wasabi will move into the middle portion of the three-tenant main floor of the former Metro Drug building, 123 Broadway N., and face Second Avenue North.
Dave Scheer, a business partner with restaurant owner Keng Dechawuth, said Wasabi, which they opened at 623 NP Ave. in 2009, needs a better space. But shutting down for several months to remodel the current location would be too expensive, they said.
Instead, they're moving to the former Metro Drug pharmacy, which operated on the corner of Broadway and Second Avenue North from 1982 until July 2015. It was among several properties purchased by Gov. Doug Burgum's Kilbourne Group last year.
"It's better for us to make the move to a better site really in a renovated building than it is to try to renovate that building," Scheer said about the reason for the move.
Related content
Business Development Manager Melissa Rademacher said Kilbourne Group is excited to work with the pair and get Wasabi as a tenant.
"Putting them right in the middle of the Metro Drug building was something that we were really gung-ho about," they said.
'Trying new things'
Crews have worked for months on a $1.8 million renovation of the two-story Dakotah Block building that, most recently, housed Metro Drug. The structure was built in 1893 and includes a 6,900-square-foot ground floor that originally housed furniture stores before it became a pharmacy in 1965.

Scheer said Kilbourne Group has told them he'll get access to the middle unit of the building around Oct. 1, and they can then fit up the space to open Wasabi there in early December.
Rademacher said Kilbourne Group is still in talks with two other tenants who could move into the remaining units of the building.
Wasabi won't be the only downtown restaurant seeing some changes as a result of this shuffle.
Scheer and Dechawuth operate another restaurant in their leased spot on NP Avenue, Drunken Noodle, that they opened in 2009. Scheer said Drunken Noodle will likely stay behind after Wasabi moves, though the pair plans to move Drunken Noodle to the former Navy recruiter's office, 414 Broadway, in the near future.
They said Drunken Noodle could open in its new spot, which is also owned by Kilbourne Group, sometime next spring, gaining a Broadway location and a new rooftop patio with the move.
Rademacher said Drunken Noodle will be a good addition to the block.

"What's great about Dave and Keng is that they're open to new ideas and how do they add that experience for the customer," they said.
Scheer said they plan to add a poke bar in the new Wasabi location after serving up the Hawaiian fish, rice and vegetable dish in their Poke Bowl food trailer all summer.
Their current restaurant space at 623 NP Ave., which they lease from Quantum Development Inc., could become a new eatery entirely, according to Scheer. They and Dechawuth are talking about opening a ramen restaurant there in the coming months.
The pair have opened several restaurants in the region and still own Wasabi and Drunken Noodle in Fargo. Dechawuth also has Thai restaurants in Bemidji, Minn., and Georgia.
If it seems like the duo are talking about a lot of changes, Scheer said that's because they are-something they said is more important than ever as the need to "experiment" becomes a vital part of keeping the doors open.
"In the restaurant business, I don't think these days you can just sit still," they said. "You have to keep trying new things as tastes change and as the way you deliver your food changes."

So far on this journey (which is only just beginning) of looking at the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC we have explored mostly the A53 processors within the Application Processing Unit (APU). However, we must not overlook the Real-Time Processing Unit (RPU), which contains two ARM Cortex-R5 32 bit RISC processors and operates within the Zynq MPSoC's PS' (processing systems') Low Power Domain.
R5 RPU Architecture
The RPU executes real-time processing applications, including safety-critical applications. As such, you can use it for applications that must comply with IEC61508 or ISO 26262. We will be looking at this capability in more detail in a future blog. To support this, the RPU can operate in two distinct modes:
Split or Performance: - Both cores operate independently
Lock-Step: - Both cores operate in lockstep
Of course, it is the lock-step mode which is implemented as one step when a safety application is being implemented (see chapter 8 of the TRM for full safety and security capabilities). To provide deterministic processing times, both ARM Cortex-R5 cores include 128KB of Tightly Coupled Memory (TCM) in addition to the Caches and OCM (on-chip memory). How the TCMs are used depends upon the operating mode. In Split mode, each processor has 128Kbytes of TCM (divided into A and B TCMs). In lock-step mode, there is one 256Kbyte TCM.
RPU in Lock Step Mode
At reset, the default setting configures the RPU to operate in lock-step mode. However, we can change between the operating modes while the processor group is in reset. We do this by updating the RPU Global Control Register SLCAMP bit, which clamps the outputs of the redundant processors, and the SLSPLIT bit, which sets the operating mode. We cannot change the RPU's operating mode during operation, so we need to decide upfront during the architectural phase which mode we desire for a given application.
However, we do not have to worry about setting these bits when we use the debugger or generate a boot image. Instead we can use these to configure the operating mode. What I want to look at in the rest of the blog is look at how we configure the RPU operating mode both in our debug applications and boot-image generation.
The first way that we verify many of our designs is to use the System Debugger within SDK, which allows us to connect over JTAG or Ethernet and download our application. Using this method, we can of course use breakpoints and step through the code as it operates, to get to the bottom of any issues in the design. Within the debug configuration tab, we can also enable the RPU to operate in split mode if that's the mode we want after system reset.
Debug Configuration to enable RPU Split Mode
When you download the code and run it on the Zynq MPSoC's RPU, you will be able to see the operating mode within the debug window. This should match with your debug configuration setting.
Debug Window showing Lock-Step Mode
Once we are happy with the application, we will want to create a boot image and we will want to determine the RPU operating mode when we create that boot image. We can add the RPU elf to the FSB, FPGA, and APU files using the boot-image dialog. To select the RPU mode, we choose the edit option and then select the destination CPU‚Äîeither both ARM Cortex-R5 cores in lockstep or the ARM Cortex-R5 core we wish it run on if we are using split mode.
Selecting the R5 Mode of operation when generating a boot image
Of course if we want to be sure we are in the correct mode in this operation, we need to read the RPU Global Control register and ensure the correct mode is selected as expected.
Now that we understand the different operating modes of the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC's RPU, we can come back to these modes when we look at the security and safety capabilities provided by the Zynq MPSoC.
Code is available on Github as always.

Shik≈ç Academy student council president Rem Kaginuki calls on the girl, and they begin having mysterious encounters with the student council members. Them life changed a little from that day, but Ritsuka expected nothing more.
However, they come home to find their mother collapsed with suspicious hooded men nearby. They were not human but devils, vampires, and exorcists seeking the Forbidden Grimoire. Ritsuka's former daily life crumbles around her, and they find themselves slowly becoming attracted to Rem, who helps them in their predicament. On the other hand, confusion deepens with regard to their brother who carries a secret. Ritsuka is unsure what path to choose as they find themselves at the center of a love story.
The new film will feature the same staff and cast as the television anime series. Rejet's Daisuke Iwasaki is in charge of the original plan, and Ai Yoshimura is directing the film at Brain's Base. Tomoko Konparu is writing the script, and Yuka Takashina is adapting Hirotaka Maeda's original character designs for animation. Elements Garden is composing the music, and Elements Garden's Junpei Fujita and DIVE II Entertainment are producing the music.
The film will star:
Himika Akaneya as Ritsuka Tachibana

Game developer Rejet, music production studio Elements Garden, and music production company Avex are collaborating on the Dance With Devils franchise. A 12-episode television anime series premiered in Japan in October 2015. Funimation Entertainment streamed the series with subtitles as it aired in Japan, and also streamed a Broadcast dub. Funimation describes the story:
From Rejet, the original creator of Diabolik Lovers, and Brain's Base, the studio behind Princess Jellyfish, comes a devilish tale of high school seduction. Second-year student Ritsuka Tachibana has the perfect school-to-life balance, but all of that's thrown into chaos when they discover that several of their handsome male classmates are actually demons in disguise.
Rejet's PlayStation Vita game shipped in Japan in March 2016.
The franchise has also inspired two stage musicals. The first stage musical ran in March 2016 in Tokyo, and the second musical, titled Dance with Devils ~Da Capo~ , ran in Tokyo from December 21-27.
Samako Natsu launched a manga for the franchise in Square Enix's G Fantasy magazine in September 2015 titled Dance with Devils -Blight- . Square Enix published the manga's second and final compiled volume in May 2016.
Update: Film story added.

NETHERLANDS. OH YES, AGAIN THE NETHERLANDS. A MUSLIM BEATS A DUTCH GIRL SO BADLY RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF STREET. THIS MUSLIM LATER TOLD THE POLICE THAT They Are IN LOVE WITH Them THE GIRL GOT BEATEN BECAUSE They REFUSED THIS MUSLIM TO BE Them COMPANIONKROMMENIE (Noord-Holland), 10th June 2015. A Dutch woman, on Wednesday evening at 10.15pm, got knocked by a Muslim. They had beaten them up, kicked her, gripped them firmly by their throat and dragged them by their hair.She was forced by them to step in a car. They were with a companion. Later on both of them had left by car with the woman. The sit by neighbours had seen the maltreatment at the Mercury Plein (square) but hadn't done anything at all to stop it. What the f***ing cowards ! typical Europeans,,,The men were later been arrested by the police at the Neptunus Laan (Avenue) in Krommenie. The video had been taken by a passer by who work for DE TELEGRAAF TV but this guy didn't do anything for them as well.
In a recent video interview from the Time Space Existence series (you can see it here thanks to our media partner PLANE-SITE) acclaimed Japanese architect Kengo Kuma expresses some truly interesting thoughts about architecture and the role of architects in today's world.
In the interview, made in the architect's Tokio office, Kuma particularly focus on three points.
In the first, they talk about modesty, a quality arguably quite rare in most architectural offices. In Kuma's vision, for architects, humbleness originates from working slowly and methodically, moving step by step, without haste, from small, relatively modest projects ‚Äì into which architectural design merges with simple and budget-conscious construction techniques ‚Äì towards larger, more ambitious ones.
The second point reflects the approach of Kuma themselves to architectural design, a process which begins with an almost physical experience of the place where a new building will be sited.
‚ÄúWhenever a start a project, I myself walk along the site and try to feel the reality of the place. If I touch the ground with my own feet and I touch the trees with my hand, I can feel the reality of the place, that's my method. And that's the starting point of the conversation with a place‚Äù, Kuma says.
Another fundamental element of Kuma's design philosophy is the relationship with nature and the aspiration to make it merge with architecture, a lesson the architect learned when working to projects in Japan's countryside during the 1990s, and which explains their preference for natural, locally sourced materials.
The third point focuses on the relationship between architecture, space, and time; a theme all the video interviews of the TSE series share and investigate.
For Kuma, the key-point of the relationship between architecture and space is the transition ‚Äúfrom architecture as monument to architecture as environment‚Äù which for them marks the transition from the 20th to the 21st century, and from industrialization to post-industrialization. Talking about time, for Kuma building and time should merge into one, dynamic totality since ‚ÄúWe cannot control time. Time is always flowing, and architecture should be part of that kind of flow‚Äù, a concept deeply-rooted in the Buddhist culture the Japanese architect plainly admires.

About Kengo Kuma
Born in 1954 in Yokohama, Japan, Kengo Kuma studied architecture at the University of Tokyo and, later, Columbia University. In 1987, they founded the Spatial Design Studio before establishing Kengo Kuma & Associates in 1990. Kuma's works ‚Äì sometimes characterized by peculiar envelopes which resemble hand-woven fabric ‚Äì combine references traditional Japanese design and craftsmanship with a innovative form which often make a creative use of state-of-the-art digital fabrication techniques.
Kuma's most significant buildings include the Stone Museum in Nasu, the Noh Stage in the Forest pavilion in the Miyagi prefecture, the Nagasaki Prefectural Museum, the Sunnyhills showroom and the the Asakusa Cultural Center in Tokio, and the River / Filter restaurant in Fukushima.
Projects currently underway include the V&A Museum Dundee, and the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Stadium.
About Time-Space-Existence
Time, space and existence. These three concepts sketch out the contours of the world around us ‚Äî a fact especially true within architecture. Taking these words as its starting point, the GAA Foundation is set to curate its fourth collateral exhibition in the context of La Biennale di Venezia Architettura, entitled Time-Space-Existence and opening in May 2018. Featuring over 100 established and emerging architects, and unapologetically international in breadth, the exhibition provides a fascinating complement to a biennial traditionally drawn along national lines.

Almost 200 flights were cancelled at Toronto's Pearson International Airport today after workers assigned to fuel aircraft called in sick, joining an unsanctioned job action that has hit Air Canada the hardest.
Consolidated Aviation Fueling Services saw less than half of its expected employees show up for morning and early afternoon shifts at Pearson today.
Those who stayed away are protesting what they say will be future job losses stemming from Air Canada's decision to switch fuel providers.
Airport officials said at 5 p.m. the disruption had caused 185 flight cancellations.
"We have been co-ordinating with the air carriers and have encouraged them to prioritize their flights," Howard Eng, president and CEO of the Greater Toronto Airport Authority, said in a statement.
The cancellations involved multiple Air Canada flights out of Terminal 1 to destinations across the country and parts of the U.S.
Both the union and the GTAA said they do not know whether there will be further disruptions on Saturday. Travellers are advised to check their flights before leaving home.
Airport officials said earlier other airlines may also be affected, though throughout the day the airport's online departure board showed almost all of the cancellations were Air Canada flights.
Local 2413 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents the workers, did not sanction Friday's job action.
Union spokesperson Bill Trbovich said earlier in the day that morning crews refused overtime and managers were expected to do the refuelling.
Some 300 fuelling workers at Pearson expect to lose their jobs this October after Air Canada opted to switch providers, according to a union memo.
The workers have been aware of the coming change since last fall, both the union and Air Canada say.
Frustrated passengers who made it to the airport before finding out about the cancellations lined up to rebook flights.
Air Canada offers free rebooking
Air Canada spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick said the airline wasn't directly involved in Friday's dispute.
"This is between the fuelling company employees and the fuelling company. We're a third-party victim," said Peter Fitzpatrick.
"This is not a labour disruption between the airlines and their fuelling company," they said in an email to CBC News.
"This is a labour disruption at Consolidated Aviation Fueling Services which is affecting all airlines at Pearson."
Fitzpatrick confirmed Air Canada had switched providers, but said the airline expects that the fuellers would be able to find work with the new company it has hired.
Air Canada passengers affected by the cancellations can find more information here.
An official for the airline said passengers could rebook at no cost.
Airport officials are urging travellers to check on the status of their flights before heading to the airport.
Nintendo To Continue Bringing Third-Party Nintendo 3DS Titles To The West
By Ishaan . February 3, 2014 . 10:02am
While sales of the Wii U leave much to be desired, Nintendo's Nintendo 3DS has sold over 40 million units worldwide. The 3DS is in a far better position than Wii U from both a hardware and sales perspective, and Nintendo say it will be their primary means of earning profits in their next fiscal year, which begins on April 1st, 2014.
Speaking with investors and analysts at a Q&A, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata shared that Nintendo intend to deliver a number of key Nintendo 3DS titles this year.
‚ÄúSince Nintendo 3DS has an installed base of more than 40 million units globally as I mentioned earlier, we are now getting to the point where it is impossible not to turn a profit with our software business,‚Äù Iwata stated. ‚ÄúWe have many key titles to be released in this calendar year and we will strive to drive profits from these titles. Seen in this light, I believe the key profit-driver for the next fiscal year will be Nintendo 3DS.‚Äù
Three of these ‚Äúkey titles‚Äù that Nintendo have already revealed presumably include Kirby Triple Deluxe, Yoshi's New Island and the new Super Smash Bros. game; but in addition to first-party games, Iwata says Nintendo will continue to publish certain third-party 3DS titles from Japan in the west, both this year and the next.
‚ÄúWe sometimes distribute, or even publish depending on the circumstances, games that were made by Japanese software publishers in the overseas markets, and you can expect to see more examples of this this year and the next,‚Äù Iwata said to investors.
(The most recent example of this is Square Enix's Bravely Default, an RPG for 3DS.)
Finally, Iwata also stated that more third-party publishers in the west are taking note of the fact that Nintendo 3DS sales are over 10 million in both the U.S. and Europe, but since western developers are more focused on delivering high-end games for home consoles, they're still in the process of figuring out what kind of 3DS games to develop.
WASHINGTON ‚Äî On Tuesday, call them the tiebreaker.
A vice president does not have much on their plate, as far as constitutional responsibilities go. They preside over the official count of electoral votes once, possibly twice, and, in the meantime, they wait in the wings in case the president becomes incapacitated.
But Vice President Mike Pence is expected to demonstrate the position's unique duty, and in historic fashion: In their capacity as president of the Senate, they are expected to cast the deciding vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as President Trump's education secretary ‚Äî the first time a vice president has had to resolve a tie on a cabinet nomination in the nation's history.
Allowed to vote only when the Senate is deadlocked, vice presidents have a long history of settling disputes. John Adams, for instance, cast votes that helped determine the location of the United States capital and averted war with Britain.
Ahead of Mr. Pence's potential vote, here is a look back at a few crucial moments in modern vice-presidential tiebreaking.
How we plan to achieve transparency and inclusion for the community
Our community is everything for us. With Aragon, we want a thousand communities to flourish. Tokens align the incentives of communities and projects towards the same goals and values. But those communities are the center of where the magic happens.
Two weeks ago we posted our Community Governance Model for feedback from the community. We received some comments on it, and we now have the final version of the model ready. Before this, we had already worked on the model internally. I drafted the original version and Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo provided their thoughts on it.
Further changes might be made as things develop. But we wanted to show the community what we'll be doing in terms of governance, transparency and inclusion.
The model was designed so that every community member will be treated equally. Everyone will have the same changes of participation, and our Meetings and decisions to be transparent.
We have already held our first Dev meeting that was livestreamed and open to community questions. This Friday, July 14th, we'll have our first public Community Meeting. The Community Meeting will also have our first regular AMA with it. Feel free to send your questions at our subreddit, on this thread.
Goals
We want a productive, happy and agile community that can welcome and bring forth new ideas.
We will rely on 5 key principles:
Independence
Decision-making structure
Independence from employment relations
Pluralism
Diversity of contributors
Management of conflict
Determination of leadership ‚Äî processes and turnover
Representation
Membership structure and rights
Ways in which those in authority are accountable to contributing members
Degree to which members can exercise voice on community members
Decentralized decision-making
How contributors gain code commit and #frontline rights
How contributors gain access to the project's decision-making structure
The degree to which project communications and activities are publicly available
Autonomous participation
Newcomer joining rate
Newcomer socialization opportunities
Rate of idea generation
Description
Our Code of Conduct and Community Guidelines act as a basis for all our community activity, how to participate, how to grow our community, how to represent Aragon to others outside the community.
Meetings
Community meeting
Monthly, first Friday of the month. Time 17.00 CET.
Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that's fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday's meeting.
Meeting agenda will be created based on the topics the team members present in their write-ups and discussion entailed around these topics will take place in the meeting. Live chat audience of the meeting is encouraged to participate and comment on the discussion during the meeting.
Following all the other things in the meeting agenda, an AMA (Ask Me Anything) will take place where the team answers questions by the community. The AMA questions can be posted at a dedicated thread on/r/aragonproject.
Facilitator : Project Lead
: Project Lead Participants : All Aragon team members + possible relevant contributors
: All Aragon team members + possible relevant contributors Viewers: Public on Youtube

Aragon HQ Meetings were held previously once a month, but have been merged into one Community Meeting as per AGP7: Merge Aragon HQ and Community meetings.
Structures
Project Lead or Tech Lead will have final call on all things pertaining to their area of expertise.
Decisions made after thorough conversation on Meetings, informal vote to be taken if necessary, possible conflicts discussed if necessary, final vote if needed and decision confirmed by Project/Tech Lead.
Facilitators are responsible for gathering the agenda for the Meetings where applicable, as well as either taking notes of the Meeting and decisions made or delegating this responsibility to another participant
Use (The Etherian's or our own) Colony to have community members participate and get rewarded for their non-code contributions
Implement a system similar to Maker's Actions and post a monthly transparency report about the use of funds to the blog
Institute Aragon Improvement Proposal, AIP, system for community members to create proposals about Aragon. Take a similar approach for governance with Aragon Governance Proposals. GitHub Issues will be used as a forum to discuss proposals by community and team members
Proposals and ideas from the team and community members will be gone through the AIP/AGP process and will then be discussed in the relevant Meetings
Community Meetings will be AMA styled video meetings where team members will answer questions by the community members. Questions will be submitted through Reddit and answered live
We'll have templates that can/will be used for the basis of agendas in Meetings so the Facilitator can easily fill out each Meetings info, like who will be presenting what, who has slides etc.
Facilitator of the Meeting will make sure that the discussion stays on rails, everyone gets a chance to speak their mind, everything on the agenda is discussed, necessary decisions are made and that the Meeting length stays on a reasonable length

Experts believe that up to 7,000 bodies from Mississippi's first ‚ÄòLunatic Asylum,' built in 1855, are buried under what is now the University of Mississippi Medical Center campus.
The bodies are former patients and stretch across 20 acres (81,000 sq meters) of land under the university campus which is earmarked for future construction. Experts used ground penetrating radar to make the extraordinary find.
The graves were first discovered in 2013 when construction crews, working on a new road project, unearthed 66 unmarked graves on the campus, leading researchers to further survey the site.

Later, in 2015, during work on a campus parking garage, a further 1,000 bodies were discovered and shortly after another 1,000 were found just north of the construction site. Following further surveying, experts believe that the total number of bodies under the campus is closer to 7,000.
The University of Mississippi, or ‚ÄòOle Miss', now has a plan to exhume and rebury each body and create a memorial to the dead, along with a visitors center and a laboratory which would be used to study the remains and clothes and coffins from the period. The project, however, comes at a hefty price.
Initially it was thought that the cost of exhuming and reburying each corpse would be $3,000, taking the total to a staggering $21 million. Now the university is looking at another plan at a cost of $400,000 for at least eight years, bringing the total a substantially less $3.2 million.

The Mississippi State Lunatic Asylum, later renamed the Mississippi State Insane Hospital, was the brainchild of civil war nurse Dorothea Dix. They strove for better conditions for the nation's mentally ill patients who, up until then, had been jailed and shunned by wider society.
The institution operated from 1855 to 1935, when it was moved to the present site of the Mississippi State Hospital. Construction didn't begin on the university's medical center until almost two decades later, with Ole Miss opening its doors to its first students in 1955.
FDA clears AliveCor's KardiaBand as the first medical device accessory for the Apple Watch
Posted on November 30, 2017
Wearable technology such as the Apple Watch have shown promise with their fitness capabilities, and the future has always appeared bright in relation to their value to healthcare, but technology hasn't caught up to the potential. Until now.
AliveCor just became the first company to get an Apple Watch accessory cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medical device.
Our new KardiaBand has become the first #FDA cleared medical device for Apple Watch. https://t.co/VKOhwr2PRw pic.twitter.com/6vIvdyldRw ‚Äî AliveCor (@AliveCor) November 30, 2017
What is the AliveCor KardiaBand?
Simply put, the AliveCor KardiaBand is a watch band for the Apple Watch that allows the user to take an EKG reading by placing their finger on a sensor pad that is located on the watch band. Within 30 seconds, the user has their EKG, which can be used to detect abnormal heart rhythm and atrial fibrillation (AFib).
In an interview with TechCrunch, AliveCor CEO, Vic Gundotra, had this to say:
‚ÄúApple might be able to say ‚Äòoh your heart rate is high' ‚Ä¶but what does that mean? Does that mean you should go to the hospital? And if you go to the hospital what are they going to do?. Any doctor will say ‚Äòok come in, lets get an EKG reading',‚Äù Gundotra told TechCrunch.
EKGs are usually only available in offices and hospitals ‚Äî and only after a life-threatening event. Having one on your wrist that you can use to check your heart and then send a readout straight to your doctor is vital to prevention of a heart attack or stroke.
And, as Gundotra also points out, ‚ÄúIt's not possible to diagnose atrial fibrillation without FDA clearance. That is a big, big play.‚Äù
Why the KardiaBand is Important?
From a personal perspective, I've wanted a device like this since the Apple Watch was introduced. While I do not have AFib, I do suffer from frequent abnormal heart rhythms called Tachycardia's. They are typically benign, but there is no telling when, and if, one of the events will be more severe. Having a device like this literally at my finger tips would bring a sense of peace as I would automatically know if an abnormal rhythm is detected.
In the past, the only way to catch an abnormal rhythm was to have it happen when getting an EKG at the doctor or by wearing a halter monitor for several days. That is not practical, or safe.
The other benefit I see is not having to go to my cardiologist twice per year just to get an EKG reading. No more wires and gels, just a simple finger placement on a watch band that I already wear everyday. Additionally, the cost savings to insurance companies has to be substantial.
I've never asked for a breakdown of what my cardiologist charges the insurance company for the EKG diagnostic reading, but I have to believe it is more expensive than the $199 that AliveCor is charging for KardiaBand. For the full functionality, including potentially detecting abnormal heart beats, you would need to pay $99/year for a software feature called SmartRhythm.
Still, there is no doubt this is cheaper that the alternative.
What Cardiologists Are Saying?
Thoughts
The Apple Watch has been fantastic for fitness tracking.
For health / patient monitoring up to this point? Not so much.
The AliveCor KardiaBand looks like a great step in helping unlock Apple Watch's potential in healthcare.
I do expect to give it a shot as you can pay with pre-tax dollars using your FSA, HSA or HRA. This is important as many of us still have funds left to use before 2018.
In the late 90s The Fast Show used to feature a recurrent sketch in which a group of men and one woman would be brainstorming for ideas. The punchline was always the same: the woman would be the one to find the solution but no one would seem to hear it until a man repeated it using slightly different words, having not quite understood it, whereupon he'd be treated like a total genius.
I think things are a bit like that in feminism these days. We have decades of serious scholarship and wonderful ideas but unfortunately most of it has come from not just from women, but from stupid old cis women (a bit like your mum, but more bigoted). That can't be any good, can it? Best repackage it to make it seem more clever and authoritative. Best say it's coming from someone with a deeper, more meaningful understanding of sex and gender. Best pretend it's all new, all the better to continue pissing from a great height onto the very people we claim to be liberating.
This was the feeling I got from reading the latest in a long line of ‚Äúwhy it's The Right Thing to call women cis even if they don't like it‚Äù pieces. In ‚ÄúDon't like the word ‚Äòcis'? Good‚Äù C N Lester (who is not a cis woman) informs us that words, while they may not capture things precisely, are, like, really important tools! Wow! Who'd have thought it? Not stupid TERFs, that's for sure (since it's not as though they've ever said words matter in the context of describing oppression, is it?). No, these are all new ideas. If they sound like something that useless, bigoted feminists have been saying for the past thirty years, that's pure coincidence.
While acknowledging that trans and cis are blunt tools, Lester argues that ‚Äúto use the words ‚Äòcis' and ‚Äòtrans' in public and political contexts is not to create that system ‚Äì nor, hopefully, to sustain it ‚Äì but to know the enemy and to fight it‚Äù. This is of course a bit like saying that to talk about female oppression in the context of female bodies is not to create the sex class system ‚Äì nor, hopefully, to sustain it ‚Äì but to know the enemy and to fight it. It's a bit like saying that, except it isn't, because Lester's example is obviously dead clever and nuanced whereas the second is the kind of thing that would get you called a vile essentialist bigot. To describe is not to prescribe, unless you're putting forward a theory of patriarchy, in which case STOP PRESCRIBING. Why should this be the case? My guess is that there's this group of people ‚Äì no idea how to identify them ‚Äì whose narratives are seen as more suspect than everyone else's. I can't say any more than that or else you'd suspect me of being one of them.
Lester goes on to explain how the concept of ‚Äúcis privilege‚Äù is necessary in order to describe trans people's experiences of oppression:
Transphobia is real ‚Äì a daily occurrence for so many trans people. And we need a word to describe the fact that transphobia is not a natural and logical extension of that transness ‚Äì something terrible, but the kind of thing that happens to minority groups. Bigotry is not natural or excusable. That term, ‚Äòcis privilege', which so many people seem to take umbrage at ‚Äì it's no more than an admission of transphobia, but turned around so as to highlight the injustice of its existence.
Is it just me, or does this all seem strangely familiar? It's as though I've read it before but in a completely different context ‚Äì an evil TERFy context, to be precise. Amazing how one only needs to tweak a few words and the same concepts shift from being inclusive and insightful to suddenly being VILE HATE SPEECH:
Male and female socialisation is real ‚Äì enforced membership of the subordinate sex class is a daily reality for all females. And we need a word to describe the fact that female subjugation is not a natural and logical extension of femaleness ‚Äì something terrible, but the kind of thing that happens to inferior human beings. Bigotry is not natural or excusable. That term, ‚Äòmale privilege', which so many people seem to take umbrage at ‚Äì it's no more than an admission of female oppression, but turned around so as to highlight the injustice of its existence.
Strange, isn't it? When you make that comparison it's almost as though ordering females to own up to their cis privilege all the fucking time is equivalent to telling trans women to talk about their male privilege at every available juncture. And neither of those things strikes me as particularly appropriate. But if, as Lester argues, there is a time and place to discuss cis privilege, even if one is female, then there's a time and place to talk about male privilege, even if one is a woman. Or should all that be dismissed as TERF talk? If so, why?
A factor of female oppression is to be viewed as unworthy of having a story of one's own. You are a vessel for others; your words do not count. This is one of the things that can make it hard to articulate what females ‚Äì and only females ‚Äì experience (by which I do not mean some imaginary shared female experience, but any sort of experience at all; we are mirrors and mirrors are not meant to talk back). Much of what gets described as bigotry ‚Äì setting one's own boundaries, asking for one's own words ‚Äì could more accurately be described as ‚Äúnot being female enough‚Äù. We should be yielding, accommodating, compliant. We are stymied by the very gender stereotypes we set out to challenge. A narrative that centres us is impermissible; it can only ever be retold in other words, shifting the focus away from us and our unstable core.
No wonder some seek to approach the discussion from a different angle and then believe their own words are fresh and new. But the truth is they're not. It's just Fast Show-style sexism that makes it seem that way. Patriarchy is as strong as ever and the appropriation of feminist ideas, with neither acknowledgement nor equality of application, does little to challenge it.

Today a friend of mine posted an article about how there really is no time. It's a pretty good article, although the source it comes from is a bit questionable. Other articles they have posted include pieces on some fat flush drink flushes fat away, and the 7 most effective ways to induce an out-of-body experience.
Still, although it contains some cool, thought provoking stuff, it's one of those articles in which someone not too terribly schooled in current physics tries to tie together things they've read in a lot of pop culture magazines and books about current physics. I'm not qualified to judge how close such articles are to understanding real physics.
One problem I have with these kinds of articles is the way their writers always seem to want to jump to the conclusion that something called consciousness underlies everything. The writer of this particular piece strays from the stack of Discover and Scientific American magazines he's been quoting to throw in their own speculations, which go like this:
‚ÄúConsciousness is the formless, invisible field of energy of infinite dimension and potentiality, the substrate of all existence, independent of time, space, or location, of which it is independent yet all inclusive and all present. It encompasses all existence beyond all limitation, dimension, or time, and registers all events, no matter how seemingly miniscule, such as even a fleeting thought. The interrelationship between time and consciousness from the human perspective is limited, when in fact it is unlimited.‚Äù
For a long while I thought this was something like the Buddhist view of things. But then Nishijima Roshi blew my mind one day with a simple five-word sentences.
‚ÄúConsciousness is just an illusion,‚Äù they said.
They made this statement in reply to someone attending one of their lectures who hijacked the Q&A session to deliver a monologue that made pretty much the same points as the writer of the article my friend posted. I remember the guy literally sputtering in response.
In Buddhist terms, consciousness is just one of the five things that come together to form a human being, or, by extension, to form the universe. These five are 1) form 2) feelings 3) perceptions 4) impulses and 5) consciousness. So consciousness, in Buddhist terms, is not only not the substrate of all existence, it isn't even the most important of the five elements that constitute existence. Also, when you push a little deeper into Buddhist ideas, all five of these elements are different manifestations of the very same thing. And if you dare to go beyond that, the ultimate answer is, ‚ÄúI don't know.‚Äù
But, to me, an even deeper question is why does this even matter?
I mean, I get why people are interested in it. I certainly am interested in these kinds of trippy ideas. But if they're just things for bros to trade with each other when they're stoned, who really cares? Do these questions have meaning in a world where religious maniacs are burning people in cages, where the planet we live on is getting hotter and nobody's doing anything about it, and where this coming weekend the Grammys are going to tell us that yet another batch of talentless pretty-boys and glamour-girls are the best musicians the world has produced?
Actually, I think maybe it does matter.
It matters because we will only be able to solve our problems when we are willing to look at life realistically, and see it for what it is.
The problem with saying things like ‚ÄúConsciousness is the formless, invisible field of energy of infinite dimension and potentiality, the substrate of all existence‚Äù is that you have reached a conclusion. You have defined life. You have boxed it in. And now that you have your box of life, you can swing it around at other people's boxes of life and see if your box can break theirs.
What Nishijima said to that guy was a challenge to go beyond the box that they had created. They were asking them to question their own answer.
There is a lot we can learn and discover about the universe we are living in. We can, in fact, even discover the ultimate answer. Yet that ultimate answer does not fit into any box. When you think you've found the ultimate box, that's when trouble starts.

Baljinder Kaur Gill, 34, was the victim of a plot orchestrated by four Polish men who caused a crash in a bid to fraudulently claim up to ¬£20,000.
The case was the first of its kind to cause the death of an innocent motorist.
Miss Gill's family said they would never recover from their loss and said they were an ‚Äúinnocent victim of a cold-blooded and calculated incident‚Äù.
Noel Lucas QC, prosecuting, cited figures from the Insurance Fraud Bureau showing premiums are pushed up by such scams. Some 381 false claims are made daily, costing the motor industry ¬£1.7 million.
Top: Radoslaw Bielawski, left, and Jacek Kowalczyk; bottom: Andrzez Skowron, left, and Artur Okrutny
Two days afterwards, the men, all from London, made insurance claims in a bid to profit from the tragedy.
Passing sentence, Mr Justice Sweeney said the men bore equal responsibility for Miss Gill's death, which was the product of a ‚Äújoint enterprise‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is the first such enterprise to result in a death to come before the courts,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúThe fact that it didn't also lead to you getting any money is no thanks to you but because of the police investigation into this crash.‚Äù They said Miss Gill's death continued to have, ‚Äúan absolutely devastating effect on their family‚Äù, particularly their mother and brother who suffered the loss of their other brother to cancer shortly afterwards.
On June 11, 2011, the four men drove an Audi A3 and a VW Passat in tandem down the A40, remaining in constant contact by telephone as they looked for a vehicle that they could be confident was insured. The plan was to contrive an apparent accident in which it would crash into the back of the Passat and all involved could claim compensation.
A Ford Transit van, being driven in the fast lane at 70mph, was chosen as the target and Kowalczyk positioned the Passat in front of ahead on a stretch of the road near Denham, Buckinghamshire.
The men then staged a crash by swerving the Audi into the outside lane, forcing the Passat to brake hard.
Under cross-examination, Bielawski described the manoeuvres as ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù and Kowalczyk admitted they were ‚Äúhighly dangerous‚Äù.
Miss Gill, who had been driving their Ford Fiesta behind the transit van was careered into the back of it, becoming stranded in the outside lane.
They got out of their car and was reaching into the back seat to get something when they were hit by a Renault van travelling at high speed, driven by Colin Lee, 34. The crash was described by one witness as ‚Äúan explosion of metal glass and dust‚Äù.
Bielawski, 24, and Kowalczyk, 32, were both jailed for 10 years and three months for conspiracy to commit fraud, causing death by dangerous driving and conspiracy to pervert the cause of justice.
Skowron, 25, was jailed for 10 years for conspiracy to commit fraud and causing death by dangerous driving.
Okrutny, 23, who was not present at the crash, was jailed for 12 months for conspiring to pervert the course of justice by providing false driver details after the crash and making a false statement to police about the incident.
Lee, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was jailed for 12 months for causing death by careless driving, having been previously cleared by a jury of causing death by dangerous driving.
Miss Gill's family said in a statement: ‚ÄúWe hope that the result of these court proceedings will prevent any other innocent person being killed or injured on the road through the greed of others.‚Äù
Originally designed for the opening of New York City's first women's bookstore in 1972, the trans-exclusionary feminist slogan ‚ÄúThe Future Is Female‚Äù has been popularized by Los Angeles-based retail shop Otherwild. In a video recorded for the 2017 Makers Conference, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton used the slogan when reflecting on the 2017 Women's March in Washington. At this march, pink pussy hats were worn en masse by white cisgender women who failed to recognize that not all vaginas are pink and not all people with vaginas are women.
The popularization of "The Future Is Female" as a feminist slogan contributes to violence against two-spirit, trans and non-binary people by reinforcing the gender binary and excluding us from the movement. If we cannot see ourselves in the struggle, who will? The future is not female ‚Äì it is two-spirit, trans and non-binary. In our symbols and in our slogans, we need to move away from imagery and language that reinforces the cissexism of the gender binary.
Reproductive feminism can fight for the rights of those with vaginas without insinuating that vagina ownership equates to womanhood. Similarly, feminism that fights for gender equality can be inclusive of woman regardless of their genitalia. When language inflates the notion that womanhood is reducible to genitalia, it erases trans women in the process. Given that trans women, especially trans women of color, are the most disadvantaged demographic of women, removing them from the struggle for gender equality in fact contributes to violence against women.
In moving away from gender essentialist narratives, reproductive feminism can emphasize that bodily autonomy and access to healthcare are paramount for everyone regardless of gender identity. In doing so, reproductive feminism can continue to fight towards its traditional goals, such as access to abortion and birth control while simultaneously centering transgender rights. At present, there are hurdles for two-spirit, trans and non-binary people that exist not only from anti-choice proponents but also self-identified feminist organizations that are in fact cissexist. For example, there are women's shelters that allow trans men to access their services but not trans women, the most marginalized among women, on the basis of biological sex.
Reproductive feminism and transgender rights are not diametrically opposed. Instead, reproductive feminism has in many ways positively impacted the fight for transgender rights by demonstrating the importance of bodily autonomy and integrity as well as increasing access to healthcare services such as abortion and hormone treatment. While the concept of choice has been predominantly beneficial to cisgender women in previous decades, it is more frequently being applied to the fight for two-spirit, trans and non-binary people to make crucial decisions regarding their bodies.
In order to be inclusive of two-spirit, trans and non-binary people, feminist campaigns should focus on increased accessibility, visibility and awareness. When fighting for reproductive healthcare, promotional materials can include imagery of gender diverse families such as trans men and non-binary people experiencing pregnancy and parenting. Women-only shelters and abortion clinics can adopt trans inclusive policies and open their doors to two-spirit, trans and non-binary people. Using gender neutral language such as ‚Äúexpectant parents‚Äù or ‚Äúvagina owners‚Äù can also promote inclusivity. There are innumerable ways to move away from gender essentialist narratives towards trans inclusiveness for activists and service providers.
Many people still believe that gender is between your ears and sex is between your legs. However, like gender, biological sex is in fact also a social construct. Biological sex is not something a baby is born with but rather something they are assigned. Discourse surrounding biological sex uses chromosomes, genitalia, gonads and a variety of secondary sex characteristics including body hair and breasts as determinants of assignment, all of which vary significantly and are not binary. With such biological diversity in human beings, no determinant of sex assignment is fixed.
Genitalia does not equate to gender and biological sex is also a construct. With this in mind, it becomes clearer to identify how using the word ‚Äúfemale,‚Äù a word usually associated with biological sex, as a significant factor in future gender equality is problematic. More than ‚Äúfemale,‚Äù the word ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is appropriate but not as a standalone. The fight for gender equality needs to be inclusive of women, both cis and trans as well as other trans, two-spirit and non-binary people. Genital-based catchphrases like ‚ÄúThe Future Is Female,‚Äù ‚ÄúViva la Vulva‚Äù and ‚ÄúPussy Grabs Back‚Äù in activism only forward the interests of cisgender women.
‚ÄúThe Future Is Female‚Äù is a catchy slogan that is being used by trans-exclusionary radical feminists and celebrities currently stuck in third wave feminism. Alluding to ‚Äúfemale biological sex‚Äù makes trans men suddenly become biologically female. Trans women are not biologically male and trans men are not biologically female. Instead, people are simply biologically diverse and it is the gender that you identify with that matters.
When we speak both of the future and now, language and symbolism matter immensely. As we work towards tomorrow and gender equality for all, it is important to be inclusive of not just cisgender women but also trans, two-spirit and non-binary people. If feminism is not intersectional and encompasses only the interests of cisgender women, the most disadvantaged of us will be left behind. When we protect our most vulnerable and center them in our activism, we can in turn break down the barriers that impact us all.
Liberal activist Tim Wise has some very strong opinions on the Alabama Senate race. In fact, their opinions are so strong they might require a warning label.
In the process, they reveal the contempt progressives have for anyone who doesn't think they way they do.
If white people elect Roy Moore in Alabama, no decent human being should ever spend another dime in that state, unless it is with a black owned business, or the Birmingham Civil Rights Museum. If Moore wins, it's time to destroy white Alabama like we should have 150 years ago ‚Äî Tim Wise (@timjacobwise) November 29, 2017
So, it's alright to annihilate people who disagree with you about the allegations against a politician?
Sure. Seems legit.
Wise opted to clarify their comments. It didn't make it sound too much better.
Yesterday I tweeted that if whites elect sexual predator Roy Moore it's time to financially destroy white Alabama. After careful reflection, I need to clarify. What I meant was: if whites elect sexual predator Roy Moore it's time to financially destroy white Alabama. #Better? ‚Äî Tim Wise (@timjacobwise) November 29, 2017
So instead of literally destroying them, they just wants to financially destroy them. Doesn't that sound so much better?
Never mind that it's impossible to economically punish whites in Alabama without also hurting blacks residing in the state. It's also impossible to punish just the Roy Moore voters in the state without punishing those who did what Wise thinks they should.
And I bet they wonder why the South tends to be full of red states.
Look, I'm not a Roy Moore fan. I happen to believe the allegations against them and think the Washington Post did an exceptional job on their report. I do find it odd that these allegations all surfaced smack dab in the middle of the whole #MeToo thing, but whatever.
However, a lot of people in Alabama don't believe the claims, and that's the thing about folks on the right. We've never once supported the idea that a woman making an allegation should automatically be believed just on general principle. That means Moore supporters are free to determine whether they believe the allegations or not.
They have determined they don't.
Yes, that might be because the allegations are simply against their guy, but what are you going to do?
Oh, yeah, destroy them.
Wise would try and punish an entire state, many of whom wouldn't have voted for Roy Moore, simply because the wrong guy got in. Their entire reasoning boils down to "be liberal or else." If they had their way, Alabama would either have to vote for a Democrat or have their entire economy wrecked.

Mauricio Pochettino has confirmed that Tottenham will play Europa League matches at Wembley Stadium this season if they drop into Europe's second tier competition.
Spurs were eliminated from the Champions League on Tuesday night, leading to reports that the club could opt to stage their potential games in Europe's secondary cup competition at White Hart Lane for the remainder of the campaign.
Moussa Sissoko has suggested it would be easier for Spurs to play at their traditional home - which is currently operating with a reduced capacity but Pochettino is adamant abandoning Wembley is out of the question.
"The player needs to focus on playing. We will play the Europa League in Wembley and we need to make it out home.
"Next season we need to play 19 games and European competition [at Wembley].

"We need to make it our home. Never, never - we will play in Wembley."
Spurs have failed to win either of their two European fixtures at the national stadium this term, despite being cheered on by record crowds.
The north Londoners have failed to reproduce their high-energy brand of football on the expansive Wembley turf and Pochettino is keen for their team to avoid any negativity at the ground they will play at during White Hart Lane's redevelopment next season.
"For me it's a big motivation [to put it right]. You always want to move forward not stop and complain or blame.
"Only you can stop to analyse and be calm to assess the team.
"I am looking forward to trying to get more possibilities to play in Wembley and the team can start to feel like home.
"The new stadium is coming - we need to move to Wembley next season and we cannot complain next season. We need to start to avoid all the negative things," they added.

The Sauber F1 Team is expected to make a key announcement about its future, either this weekend or early next week.
Pundits in the Monza paddock are fueling a rumor that the Swiss outfit could announce Charles Leclerc as one of its drivers for 2018, but that may not be the only Ferrari-linked news to be revealed.
It is believed that Sauber could actually change its name for next season and be rebranded Alfa Romeo in a move further strengthening the Hinwil-based team's ties with Maranello.
Sauber recently extended its power unit deal with Ferrari, and while team boss Frederic Vasseur insisted the squad would not be a Ferrari 'B' team, collaboration between the two partners appears to be growing.
"The deal is based on the powertrain," Vasseur said at Monza, "but then we will discuss that we could extend the deal on another parameter for some other parts."
Vasseur also played down the suggestions a deal with dominant Formula 2 rookie Leclerc is basically done.
"I think they have to be focused on the Formula 2 championship," they said.
"There are still a couple of races to go and it's a bit too early to discuss that."
In an interview earlier this year with the FIA's Auto publication, Fiat-Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne spoke of the potential return of the Quadrifoglio badge to Grand Prix racing
Marchionne has personally overseen the re-invigoration of the Alfa Romeo brand globally in the past years.
A presence in Formula 1, perhaps through an involvement with Sauber, would certainly help restore the legend of a name which provided the very foundation for Enzo Ferrari's historic endeavor.
"The instantly recognisable thoroughbred character of Alfa is something that few other brands can claim or even aspire to," Marchionne said.
"Today the brand is ready to retake its rightful position as one of the world's leading premium car brands."

Every morning, my workday begins with a selection of stories. "Human Rights Advancing in China" is a typical headline. "Building Prosperity in Tibet" or "A Step Up for Chinese Democracy" are other possibilities. There is usually at least one blistering denunciation of Japan, along with a few promising economic forecasts.
I am a journalist, and not for the Onion. The magazine I work for is one of several foreign-language rags published under the eminent leadership of the Communist Party of China. Along with dozens of other "foreign experts" at the Death Star‚Äîas an English colleague nicknamed the gray block of concrete cubes on the west side of Beijing where we work‚Äîour job is ostensibly to introduce the realities of China and its socialist democracy to the rest of the world.
The Death Star is just a small patch in a constellation of foreign-language propaganda outlets. The Communist Party controls newspapers, magazines, book publishers, websites, wire services, and television and radio stations. Some are explicitly state-owned; others are nominally independent but rely on government funding. Together they employ hundreds of foreigners as writers, editors, performers, and news anchors. All of them share the patriotic duty of broadcasting the truth about New China.
My career in the propaganda machine began during the annual scramble for a work permit. I had already drunk my way through a few years in the Chinese ESL-industrial complex when I chanced across an ad for a job in the media. The pay wasn't great, but at least I wouldn't have to supervise children. After wowing the managers with my journalistic credentials (two articles in a high school newspaper) and a very perfunctory interview, I was duly furnished with a work visa, desk, computer, and stack of business cards that identified me as a "Copy Editor/Reporter."
Reporter, I thought. Damn right.
I was following in the cobwebbed footsteps of a long tradition of pro-Chinese cheerleaders. Beginning in the 1950s, Communism's Caucasian admirers founded journals like mine to refute the lies of the capitalist media. Paradise was within reach, but you couldn't trust the bourgeois Western papers to share the good news. Reporters were gladly taken around on stage-managed show tours, where they wrote of bulging granaries and happy peasants. "More Crops with Co-ops," the Peking Review announced cheerfully in 1958, on the eve of China's greatest famine. When Serfs Stood Up in Tibet was Anna Louise Strong's glowing account of that province's joyful liberation.
Today the job is rather less exciting. The "foreign experts" at the Death Star spend most of their time editing and proofreading the translated work of Chinese writers. Occasionally we might write something on culture or music, as long as we keep a safe distance from politics. I find it disappointingly non-Orwellian.
"I usually read a piece once, and then I look it up on Google to find out what actually happened."
But there are plenty of catch-22s. My editor once asked me to write an article about Mark Zuckerberg after the billionaire broke the internet by publicly conversing in Mandarin. "We'd like you to write a feature about Mark Zuckerberg's career," they said, "but try not to talk too much about Facebook. You know it's blocked here."
Then there was also the need to maintain political correctness‚Äîa phrase that takes a much more literal meaning in China. As an expat I already knew better than to mention the four forbidden T's‚ÄîTaiwan, Tibet, Tiananmen Square, and the Muslim province of East Turkestan, formally known as Xinjiang. But now I had to learn a whole new vocabulary of political euphemisms. China's political system is a " consultative democracy"‚Äîthe government asks for opinions before it makes a decision. By the way, it's also not a one-party system: Ours is a "multiparty system of democratic cooperation." There actually are other political parties, but their activity is limited to encouragement and helpful suggestions. Taiwan is usually referred to as "China's Taiwan" and Tibet is very often "China's Tibet"‚Äîjust in case you were wondering about who owns those masses of land.
Worse than the euphemisms are the bureaucratic clich√©s‚Äîmy job is sometimes like a Chinese version of Office Space. "I'm so sick of reading words like innovation and win-win mutual cooperation ," said Alex,* who works for the Beijing‚Äîformerly Peking‚ÄîReview, one of communist China's first English-language magazines. "Sometimes you see the word cooperation four times in one sentence."
I remember finding one especially painful example in an article about "the new-type model of major power relations between China and the United States," a phrase that was duplicated in its entirety at least once in each paragraph. In every revision I mercilessly slashed it out, only to find in the next draft that some variation of "the new-type model of major power relations" had somehow crept back in. "It's a set phrase," my chief editor explained. "We're not supposed to change it." This what you get when you let bureaucratic functionaries set your editorial policies.
I quickly realized that most of us work with our fingers crossed behind our backs. "It's just propaganda," a Chinese colleague shrugged dismissively. An American co-worker was even more blunt. "I usually read a piece once, and then I look it up on Google to find out what actually happened."
Once in a while, we get a taste of proper 1950s-style agitprop. Japan is a favorite target, and it is a rare month that there is not at least one article on Japanese war crimes. There are also plenty of shrill polemics against the United States for trying to steal Taiwan and on the Philippines for encroaching on the South China Sea.
Usually these accusations are tone-deaf, like when the authorities think they're insulting someone by comparing them to the Dalai Lama. More recently, China used the Snowden revelations as ammunition against the United States, which was accused ‚Äîwithout any sense of irony‚Äîof violating human rights.
Show tours are still a thing, too. Sometimes foreign colleagues are brought on guided trips to other provinces or ethnic-minority areas, where they "report" on festivities by the happy locals. Last summer they took us to a carefully manicured model village at the edge of Beijing, where we were treated to an excellent lunch and a droning sermon from the village leaders. I could not help noticing that, besides the hotel staff and politicians, no one actually seemed to live there.
I met Richard* on one of these media field trips. They work in publishing, writing textbooks for foreigners studying Chinese abroad. Even the language students, they say, get their share of doctrine.
"One of the biggest problems [with our books] is the propaganda," they say. "They sneak their territorial claims into the textbooks. They know that no one's ever going to believe it, but they still send it overseas."
Some of the material Richard has seen wanders into tinfoil-hat territory. "There are all kinds of ultra-nationalistic nonsense and mythology. I edited a chapter once about how the original Buddhist scriptures were written in China. It's a complete myth." Another article, they said, claimed that Tiananmen Square had "the longest history of peaceful gatherings."
"Some of the foreign staff smoke pot at work. I've seen people come in to meetings high."
Richard attributed the organizational inertia to one of communism's most famous shortcomings. "There are no incentives," they said. "You don't have to work hard here. For every person who busts their ass, there are four or five who are just moseying along. Most of this company is losing money because people have no sense of business. We spent at least a million dollars on a really high-end teaching course‚Äîprofessional actors, directors, everything. It's sitting in a warehouse now because they won't bother to market it."
It wasn't just the Chinese, either. "Some of the foreign staff smoke pot at work. I've seen people come in to meetings high."
Richard and I got into the habit of spending our lunch breaks in the mezzanine of the Death Star's sumptuous European-style caf√©. It's a relaxing place to escape from Beijing's noise and toxic air. That's where I met Alex and Chris,* who sat for coffee and told me about their jobs.
"I hate it when they call us language polishers," Chris told me. "It's as if the articles were finished, and they just need us to buff out the rough bits. Like it's just cosmetics. Sometimes we have to rewrite whole articles. What we do isn't makeup; it's reconstructive surgery."
Unlike the rest of us, Chris seems to take their job seriously. "There's no sense of art," they said. "There's no style. There's no incentive to improve the writing."
Chris had held workshops to improve the quality of their colleagues' writing. "We all know that we're propagandists. We can't change the facts we use, but at least we could improve the style," they said. "What we write is a hard sell for any Western reader, but at least we don't have to keep boring them."
Of course, the journalistic standards are weaker, too. "We've got a big problem with sources," Alex said. "They don't bother with quotations or sources or anything. Sometimes they telepathize their subjects. They'll say, 'He felt deeply moved,' or 'The people were inspired by the speech.' I bring this up with the writers and they say, 'It was like that in the original,' or 'I don't see why this is a problem.' In the States you'd get fired for that."
As China develops into a country of smartphones and cappuccinos, the duties of propaganda are going beyond conventional media. Our bosses know that, like all expats , their foreign employees depend on Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for daily essentials like porn and Google. And we're not the only ones who need them.
As it tries to rebrand, the government is looking to social media‚Äîdespite the pervasive censorship, colloquially known as the "Great Firewall of China," which keeps the best parts of the internet inaccessible. Like computer-illiterate grandparents, the Communist Party needs our help posting to Twitter and Facebook.
"It's like they want all the benefits of social media and none of the consequences," Alex says. "I write the tweets for our magazine every week. But instead of just posting them, I have to send them to the web editor, who passes them on to the North American bureau.
"I only realized after a couple of days that I was expected to just use a VPN," Alex continued. "They also expect us to promote the magazine on our own Facebook profiles. They want to use us for advertising, but they won't pay $60 for a VPN."
Alex wasn't the only one. Richard was also assigned work editing their company's Facebook profile. "I said, 'How am I supposed to access Facebook? Are you going to pay for a VPN?' They replied: 'Just use your own.'"
Of course, Chinese officials could not keep face if they paid for a VPN‚Äîthat would mean acknowledging censorship exists.
It was like a Monty Python sketch‚Äîa government-owned company was ready to pay for illegal software to circumvent government censorship.
The situation got more Kafkaesque last June, when the government celebrated the Tiananmen anniversary by adding Google to the block list. Several offices, including mine, depended on Google for their everyday operations: not only the search functions but Google Translate (which is far superior to China's Baidu), Google Drive, and Gmail. The sudden clampdown caught us all by surprise.
"If this goes on much longer," my boss sighed after the second week of using Bing, "I think we might have to get that software."
It was like a Monty Python sketch‚Äîa government-owned company was ready to pay for illegal software to circumvent government censorship. Part of me secretly hoped they would keep up the censorship, just to see that happen, but the irony must have been too overt even for the dimly flickering bulbs of the internet police. Google Translate and some other functions were eventually unblocked, but search and mail remain inaccessible.
West of the Death Star, in Babaoshan, stands the headquarters of China Radio International‚ÄîChina's answer to the BBC. Founded amid the bombs and shells of the War of Anti-Japanese Resistance‚ÄîWorld War II to the rest of the world‚Äîthe radio station is older than the People's Republic. Today CRI employs voices in dozens of languages.
Alan* used to work in the English section. Unlike some of my colleagues, they can call themselves a journalist with a straight face. With 15 other regular broadcasters, their job was to keep China on the air, in English, for 24 hours a day‚Äîventriloquizing the government with a polished British accent.
"They don't actually lie," they confided. "It's not that kind of propaganda where they change the news. But some stuff they simply won't talk about.
"I was in the newsroom during the umbrella protests [in Hong Kong], and we were talking about which stories to cover," they continued. "The protests simply didn't come up. The same thing happened during the 25th anniversary of Tiananmen‚Äîno one even suggested it."
I asked what would happen if he'd suggested those stories. "It's not that they'd shut you down," they answered. "They won't say, 'We're not allowed to talk about those subjects because it's politically sensitive.' But they'd blow you off. They'll say something like, 'We've covered that before,' or 'I don't think this story sounds very interesting.'"
Still, we have very little to complain about. Life is pretty easy in the Death Star, and most of us work at the level of efficiency for which Chinese bureaucrats are famous. After a disgracefully late arrival to the office (generally between 9:30 and 10), we try to find some time between cigarette breaks to edit a few articles before retiring to the caf√© for a two-and-a-half hour lunch break. At two, we return to the office to study Chinese, work on freelance projects, or‚Äîif especially weakened by the day's toils‚Äîwatch videos on YouTube through our illegal VPNs.
As the Russians used to say, "They pretend to pay us, and we pretend to work."
Whenever I meet with foreign colleagues we usually share a laugh about the silliness we put in print. We reassure ourselves that it's just muscle-building for our serious careers in "real journalism." Sometimes we even believe it.
All countries use propaganda, of course. A great deal of my time is spent wondering if the Western media is any better. Once in a while I feel a slight twinge of bad conscience, and wonder if I should feel a bit more uneasy about working in a giant authoritarian lie factory. But at least I have the consolation of knowing that the product is defective.
"For a propaganda machine," Richard told me, "they're not that good at it."
*Several names in this article, including that of the author, have been changed to protect those still working in China.
Not much is known about DC's vision for their Green Lantern franchise, other that it exists and will likely be introduced in Justice League, though a recent post on social media might be the first clue.
The post comes from actor Andre Gordon (Modern Family, Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir), who shared a picture of John Stewart's Green Lantern with the caption "andregordonofficialThe pieces are coming together and it feels good! #johnstewart #greenlantern #greenlanterncorps #justiceleague #4HorsemenFilms"

This fits in line with previous rumors that point towards multiple Green Lanterns from sector 2814 being in the film universe and eventually in the Green Lantern Corps film. This is likely to consist of John Stewart, Hal, and possibly either Guy Gardner and Kyle Raynor. If this turns out to be true, that means that John Stewart could very well be the main Green Lantern of the Justice League, though most are still betting that it will be Hal Jordan. Fueled by their restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of their newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes‚ÄîBatman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash‚Äîit may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.

‚ÄúEverybody in America needs to take a deep breath and think about your children and think about our country,‚Äù Kasich said. ‚ÄúWe don't do well when all we do is fight.‚Äù
A suspicious vehicle containing two gas canisters has been found near a synagogue in Marseille, France, just a week after a similar incident near Paris' Notre Dame cathedral led to the arrest of several Islamic State sympathizers, local media report.
The suspicious car was found in southern France on Saturday morning next to the Community Centre of Bar Yohaye (local synagogue), La Provence newspaper reported.
Two gas cylinders were found in the car, the paper said, adding that the area has been put under heavy security.
The police Prefect of Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, Laurent Nunez, confirmed to la Province that no detonators were found in the car, adding that it was too early to draw parallels between Saturday's incident and the one that took place in Paris last week.
A similar incident took place last week next to one of Paris' most famous attractions, the Notre Dame Cathedral, where a parked Peugeot 607 was found with at least seven gas cylinders inside. One empty canister was sitting on the passenger seat, but no detonators were found during the investigation.

On Friday, French authorities confirmed that three ‚Äúradicalized‚Äù women had been arrested in connection with the Notre Dame case. RTL TV reported that the suspects had been planning to set the canisters on fire, but something reportedly went wrong, and they had to hurriedly leave the site.
One of the arrested women, identified as a 19-year-old Ines Madani, had reportedly sworn allegiance to the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorist group, French media said. They were reportedly on the ‚ÄúFiche S‚Äù list ‚Äì an indicator used by France to flag people considered to be a threat to national security. The people on that list are supposed to be constantly monitored by the authorities.
‚ÄúA group has been destroyed,‚Äù said French President Fran√ßois Hollande, referring to the arrests, while warning that ‚Äúthere are others [extremists groups]‚Äù remaining.

On Saturday, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve announced that, since the beginning of the year, French authorities have arrested some 293 people‚Äúengaged in terrorist networks.‚Äù
The country has been on high alert since January of 2015, when it was hit by a series of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL)-linked terrorist attacks.
The biggest loss of life took place in November of 2015, when at least 130 people were killed in Paris, and at least 84 people were killed in a tragedy in Nice on July 14 of this year when a truck driven by an IS sympathizer plowed through crowds during Bastille Day celebrations.
France was also shaken by the murder Father Jacques Hamel in the northern city of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray in July, when the 85-year-old priest had their throat cut by two purported IS militants.
23 Great R.C. Sproul Quotes
Tweet
R.C. Sproul (Robert Charles Sproul) was born in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania in 1939. They were a child during World War II, which had a tremendous impact upon their life. They loved sports as a child and was a true fan of the Pittsburg Steelers and Pirates. They loved to play sports too but during their high school years they had to give up their extracurricular time to get a job due to their father's illness. In their senior year of high school their father died, the family lost their home and R.C. became angry with God.
God used R.C.'s love of sports in their college days to introduce them to Jesus. It was a star college football player that talked about Jesus as though they were their best friend in the whole world. On that same night R.C. accepted Jesus as their savior. Not long after their conversion, their childhood sweetheart was also converted during a visit at their college. They were eventually married and even moved to the Netherlands so R.C. could complete doctoral studies at the Free University of Amsterdam. Upon receiving the news of their mother's illness, they returned home to the states. They were asked to teach in a lay minister's class and it was then that they realized that lay people were more on fire for the teachings of the Lord than those that they had seen in seminary.
In the early 1970's lay education became their calling and R.C. went on to teach students about Scripture, philosophy, apologetics, theology, and church history. Their Ligonier Ministries provided for the student's study, room and board in the Sproul's home and in the homes of others in the study. The style of teaching and the ministry was very much like that of Francis Schaeffer's European study center, L'Abri. R.C. also preaches on the popular radio ministry ‚ÄúRenewing Your Mind‚Äù which kicked off in 1994. Their bestselling book ‚ÄúThe Holiness of God‚Äù which was first published in 1985 is one of more than 60 books that they have written. Today they are known as an American Calvinist Theologian and pastor.
Take a look at these great R.C. C. Sproul Quotes:
Featured R. C. Sproul Quote: ‚ÄúNot until we take God seriously will we ever take sin seriously.‚Äù
Church, Praise & Worship
The complaint that church is boring is never made by people in awe.
The visible church refers to the institution called ‚Äòthe church' that has visible participants whose names appear on the roll of a local congregation. In most churches anyone who makes an outward profession of faith (and meets other criteria for membership) is admitted to active fellowship in the visible church.
The Greek work for church, ecclesia, is made up of a prefix and a root. The prefix is ek ‚Äì out of. The root is the verb coleo, to call. The church in the New Testament is made up of those who are called out from the world, from darkness, from damnation, from paganism, to become members of the body of Christ.
One does not structure the church to meet the felt needs and desires of the tares. The purpose of corporate assembly, which has its roots in the Old Testament, is for the people of God to come together corporately to offer their sacrifices of praise and worship to God. So the first rule of worship is that it be designed for believers to worship God in a way that pleases God.
The church has been established by Christ to be an army (but) armies, in order to be effective, must be very sensitive in caring for their wounded‚Ä¶ There is always a major work to be done within the church in terms of ministering to the needs of the people.
It is imperative that the Christian, at the beginning of their pursuit to understand what true worship is, gets it clear that the object of our worship is to be God and God alone
The most effective churches that I know are churches where the ministerial staff devote many hours in training and mobilizing their congregations to be mighty armies of saints, as they minister to a dying world.
The visible church may be distressingly and sorely fractured and fragmented into all different kinds of denominations and groups, but the invisible church is the true body of Christ. Everyone who is in Christ, and in whom Christ dwells, is a member of this one universal church.
God
Without God man has no reference point to define himself.
To announce to people indiscriminately that God loves them ‚Äúunconditionally‚Äù (without carefully distinguishing among the distinctive types of divine love) is to promote a perilous false sense of security in the hearers.
God's plan never changes because They never changes and because perfection admits to no degrees and cannot be improved upon.
We are called to live Coram Deo, defined as: before the presence of God, under the authority of God and to the glory of God.
If there is one maverick molecule in all the universe, then God is not sovereign. And if God is not sovereign,  They are not God.
Grace
God is not obligated to save anybody, to make any special act of grace, to draw anyone to Himself. They could leave the whole world to perish, and such would be a righteous judgment.
Perhaps the most difficult task for us to perform is to rely on God's grace and God's grace alone for our salvation. It is difficult for our pride to rest on grace. Grace is for other people ‚Äì for beggars. We don't want to live by a heavenly welfare system. We want to earn our own way and atone for our own sins. We like to think that we will go to heaven because we deserve to be there.
If God is able to make everything that happens to us work together for our good, then ultimately everything that happens to us is good. We must be careful to use the word ultimately. On the earthly plane things that happen to us may indeed be evil. ‚Ä¶Yet God in Their goodness transcends all these things and works them out to our good. For the Christian, ultimately, there are no tragedies.
Love & Marriage
Throughout the ages the church has understood that the most significant manifestation of true faith is love. Faith without love is not faith, only speculation or knowledge or mere intellectual assent. The fruit of authentic faith is always love.
To solve a marriage problem, you have to talk with each other about it, choosing wisely the time and place. But when accusations and lengthy speeches of defense fill the dialogue, the partners are not talking to each other but past each other. Take care to listen more than you speak. If you still can't agree on a solution, consider asking a third party, without a vested interest, to mediate.
In the New Testament, love is more of a verb than a noun. It has more to do with acting than with feeling. The call to love is not so much a call to a certain state of feeling as it is to a quality of action.
The biblical union of two people into one flesh did not involve the annihilation of personal identity. The unity of marriage is not to be monistic but a unity in duality.
To be sure, it is much easier to be loving if you're in love, but being in love is not intrinsically necessary to being loving ‚Äì else the Great Commandment is a farce.
A married person does not live in isolation. They or they have made a promise, a pledge, a vow, to another person. Until that vow is fulfilled and the promise is kept, the individual is in debt to their marriage partner. That is what they owe. ‚ÄúYou owe it to yourself‚Äù is not a valid excuse for breaking a marriage vow but a creed of selfishness.
Final Thoughts
R.C. Sproul was raised by ordinary parents in an ordinary city with ordinary activities. But because they surrendered to what God would have them to do, they have made extraordinary strides to present the Gospel of Jesus Christ. God uses ordinary people to do extraordinary things. Perhaps  They are calling you to do something that you think you cannot do. Surrender to Their calling and let Him equip you for what They want you to do.  They are able.

Local Storage And How To Use It On Websites

Storing information locally on a user's computer is a powerful strategy for a developer who is creating something for the Web. In this article, we'll look at how easy it is to store information on a computer to read later and explain what you can use that for.
Storing information locally on a user's computer is a powerful strategy for a developer who is creating something for the Web. In this article, we'll look at how easy it is to store information on a computer to read later and explain what you can use that for.
Adding State To The Web: The ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù Of Local Storage
The main problem with HTTP as the main transport layer of the Web is that it is stateless. This means that when you use an application and then close it, its state will be reset the next time you open it. If you close an application on your desktop and re-open it, its most recent state is restored.

This is why, as a developer, you need to store the state of your interface somewhere. Normally, this is done server-side, and you would check the user name to know which state to revert to. But what if you don't want to force people to sign up?
This is where local storage comes in. You would keep a key on the user's computer and read it out when the user returns.
C Is For Cookie. Is That Good Enough For Me?
The classic way to do this is by using a cookie. A cookie is a text file hosted on the user's computer and connected to the domain that your website runs on. You can store information in them, read them out and delete them. Cookies have a few limitations though:
They add to the load of every document accessed on the domain.
They allow up to only 4 KB of data storage.
Because cookies have been used to spy on people's surfing behavior, security-conscious people and companies turn them off or request to be asked every time whether a cookie should be set.
To work around the issue of local storage ‚Äî with cookies being a rather dated solution to the problem ‚Äî the WHATWG and W3C came up with a few local storage specs, which were originally a part of HTML5 but then put aside because HTML5 was already big enough.
Using Local Storage In HTML5-Capable Browsers
Using local storage in modern browsers is ridiculously easy. All you have to do is modify the localStorage object in JavaScript. You can do that directly or (and this is probably cleaner) use the setItem() and getItem() method:
localStorage.setItem('favoriteflavor','vanilla');
If you read out the favoriteflavor key, you will get back ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù:
var taste = localStorage.getItem('favoriteflavor'); // -> "vanilla"
To remove the item, you can use ‚Äî can you guess? ‚Äî the removeItem() method:
localStorage.removeItem('favoriteflavor'); var taste = localStorage.getItem('favoriteflavor'); // -> null
That's it! You can also use sessionStorage instead of localStorage if you want the data to be maintained only until the browser window closes.
Working Around The ‚ÄúStrings Only‚Äù Issue
One annoying shortcoming of local storage is that you can only store strings in the different keys. This means that when you have an object, it will not be stored the right way.
You can see this when you try the following code:
var car = {}; car.wheels = 4; car.doors = 2; car.sound = 'vroom'; car.name = 'Lightning McQueen'; console.log( car ); localStorage.setItem( 'car', car ); console.log( localStorage.getItem( 'car' ) );
Trying this out in the console shows that the data is stored as [object Object] and not the real object information:
You can work around this by using the native JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods:
var car = {}; car.wheels = 4; car.doors = 2; car.sound = 'vroom'; car.name = 'Lightning McQueen'; console.log( car ); localStorage.setItem( 'car', JSON.stringify(car) ); console.log( JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem( 'car' ) ) );
Where To Find Local Storage Data And How To Remove It
During development, you might sometimes get stuck and wonder what is going on. Of course, you can always access the data using the right methods, but sometimes you just want to clear the plate. In Opera, you can do this by going to Preferences ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Storage, where you will see which domains have local data and how much:
Large view
Doing this in Chrome is a bit more problematic, which is why we made a screencast:
Mozilla has no menu access so far, but will in future. For now, you can go to the Firebug console and delete storage manually easily enough.
So, that's how you use local storage. But what can you use it for?
Use Case #1: Local Storage Of Web Service Data
One of the first uses for local storage that I discovered was caching data from the Web when it takes a long time to get it. My World Info entry for the Event Apart 10K challenge shows what I mean by that.
When you call the demo the first time, you have to wait up to 20 seconds to load the names and geographical locations of all the countries in the world from the Yahoo BOSS Premium Web service. If you call the demo a second time, there is no waiting whatsoever because ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî I've cached it on your computer using local storage.
The following code (which uses jQuery) provides the main functionality for this. If local storage is supported and there is a key called thewholefrigginworld , then call the render() method, which displays the information. Otherwise, show a loading message and make the call to the Geo API using getJSON() . Once the data has loaded, store it in thewholefrigginworld and call render() with the same data:
if(localStorage && localStorage.getItem('thewholefrigginworld')){ render(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('thewholefrigginworld'))); } else { $('#list').html('
'+loading+'
'); var query = ‚Äòselect centroid,woeid,name,boundingBox'+ ‚Äò from geo.places.children(0)'+ ‚Äò where parent_woeid=1 and placetype=‚Äúcountry‚Äù‚Äò+ ' | sort(field=‚Äúname‚Äù)‚Äò; var YQL = ‚Äòhttp://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q='+ encodeURIComponent(query)+'&diagnostics=false&format=json'; $.getJSON(YQL,function(data){ if(localStorage){ localStorage.setItem(‚Äòthewholefrigginworld',JSON.stringify(data)); } render(data); }); }
You can see the difference in loading times in the following screencast:
The code for the world info is available on GitHub.
This can be extremely powerful. If a Web service allows you only a certain number of calls per hour but the data doesn't change all that often, you could store the information in local storage and thus keep users from using up your quota. A photo badge, for example, could pull new images every six hours, rather than every minute.
This is very common when using Web services server-side. Local caching keeps you from being banned from services, and it also means that when a call to the API fails for some reason, you will still have information to display.
getJSON() in jQuery is especially egregious in accessing services and breaking their cache, as explained in this blog post from the YQL team. Because the request to the service using getJSON() creates a unique URL every time, the service does not deliver its cached version but rather fully accesses the system and databases every time you read data from it. This is not efficient, which is why you should cache locally and use ajax() instead.
Use Case #2: Maintaining The State Of An Interface The Simple Way
Another use case is to store the state of interfaces. This could be as crude as storing the entire HTML or as clever as maintaining an object with the state of all of your widgets. One instance where I am using local storage to cache the HTML of an interface is the Yahoo Firehose research interface (source on GitHub):
The code is very simple ‚Äî using YUI3 and a test for local storage around the local storage call:
YUI().use('node', function(Y) { if(('localStorage' in window) && window['localStorage'] !== null){ var key = 'lastyahoofirehose'; localStorage.setItem(key,Y.one('form').get('innerHTML')); if(key in localStorage){ Y.one('#mainform').set('innerHTML',localStorage.getItem(key)); Y.one('#hd').append('
Notice: We restored your last search for you - not live data'); } } });
You don't need YUI at all; it only makes it easier. The logic to generically cache interfaces in local storage is always the same: check if a ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù button has been activated (in PHP, Python, Ruby or whatever) and, if so, store the innerHTML of the entire form; otherwise, just read from local storage and override the innerHTML of the form.
The Dark Side Of Local Storage
Of course, any powerful technology comes with the danger of people abusing it for darker purposes. Samy, the man behind the ‚ÄúSamy is my hero‚Äù MySpace worm, recently released a rather scary demo called Evercookie, which shows how to exploit all kind of techniques, including local storage, to store information of a user on their computer even when cookies are turned off. This code could be used in all kinds of ways, and to date there is no way around it.
Further Reading on SmashingMag:
Research like this shows that we need to look at HTML5's features and add-ons from a security perspective very soon to make sure that people can't record user actions and information without the user's knowledge. An opt-in for local storage, much like you have to opt in to share your geographic location, might be in order; but from a UX perspective this is considered clunky and intrusive. Got any good ideas?
Image caption BBC director general Tony Hall said they "warmly welcomed" the funding announcement
The government is to invest ¬£85m a year in enhancing BBC services around the world including in Russia, North Korea, the Middle East and Africa.
The money is to help "build the global reach of the World Service" to half a billion people and "increase access to news and information".
Director general Tony Hall said they "warmly welcomed" the announcement.
The government will provide ¬£34m between 2016-17 and ¬£85m a year from 2017-18 for digital, TV and radio.
The next review of this funding will be in 2020.
'Half a billion people target'
"This new funding is the single biggest increase in the World Service budget ever committed by any government," said Lord Hall.
"The millions announced today will help the BBC deliver on our commitment to uphold global democracy through accurate, impartial and independent news reporting.
"The World Service is one of the UK's most important cultural exports and one of our best sources of global influence. We can now further build on that."
They added: "The funding will also help speed us on to our target of reaching half a billion people globally."
The BBC currently reaches 308 million people worldwide, and its goal is to reach 500 million people by 2022.
'Build global reach'
Announcing the new funding in its document the National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review, the government said: "The BBC World Service reaches into some of the most remote places in the world, providing a link to the UK for individuals and societies who would otherwise not have this opportunity.
"We will invest ¬£85 million each year by in the BBC's digital, TV and radio services around the world to build the global reach of the World Service and increase access to news and information."
Analysis by David Silito, media correspondent
The announcement on page 49 of the Government's Strategic Defence Review makes it very clear what this money is all about - soft power. Britain's reputation, values and influence around the World.
In 2010, the coalition government decided the ¬£253 million spent on the World Service was coming to an end. The BBC would have to absorb the cost out of the licence fee.
Five years later, Chancellor George Osborne has, partially, reversed that cut in return for the BBC expanding services in to North Korea, Russian speaking areas, the Middle East and Africa.
Areas described as suffering from a "democratic deficit" - a shortage of impartial news.
And while the Government will be helping to pay the bills - editorial control remains entirely with the BBC.
And there is also another factor which may have influenced this decision to promote Britain abroad - the rapid growth of rival international news services from Russia, China and the Middle East.
The BBC's radio services around the world are in decline - the new cash will help the switch towards more TV, mobile and online services as the BBC seeks to grow its global reach from around 300 million at the moment to a target of 500 million.
The list of services to be expanded using the funding include enhanced TV services for Africa, new radio services for audiences in North Korea and radio and digital services for Ethiopia and Eritrea.
Details of which languages the BBC will broadcast in to Ethiopia and Eritrea will be announced later.
The BBC will also expand TV, radio and digital offerings in Somalia, India, Nigeria and Thailand.
A TV service will be added to the existing service for Somalia.
For Nigeria, a digital service will be started in Pidgin and Yoruba.
"Pidgin is a popular language among young people in Nigeria and across West Africa," said Liliane Landor, controller of languages at the World Service.
It will also help boost digital and TV services for Russian speakers, both in Russia and the surrounding communities.

Little more than a year after the "Panama Papers" leak, the "Paradise Papers" are shedding light on who is investing huge amounts of money in offshore tax havens.
What are the so-called Paradise Papers?
The leak is a trove of 13.4 million files taken mostly from the offshore law firm, Appleby.
The files were leaked to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the same German newspaper that took hold of the Panama Papers in April, 2016.
About 100 different media outlets worldwide are poring over the details.
"There's a new global industry that caters to money that moves around the world," Drew Sullivan, a journalist with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), told Al Jazeera. "This money moves through tax havens and it's moved to evade taxes to hide assets, to steal money.
"It's used by organised crime; it's used by large businesses."
What has been discovered so far?
Day one of the disclosures, Sunday, revealed that some big names are involved - among them 120 politicians.
Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has been named.
"[He] has a stake in a shipping firm that receives millions of dollars a year in revenue from a company whose key owners include Russian President Vladimir Putin's son-in-law and a Russian tycoon sanctioned by the US Treasury Department as a member of Putin's inner circle," said a report in the ICIJ, which received the leak from the German newspaper.
On Monday, Ross told CNBC that it was "totally wrong" they did not disclose the links.
Stephen Bronfman, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's friend and adviser, is reported to have used offshore havens to avoid tax at home.
"The disclosures are likely to generate political heat for the Canadian premier, who swept to power in October 2015 partly on their promise to tackle economic inequality and take on tax avoidance," reported Britain's Guardian newspaper, which was among the media organisations which received the leak.
The Duchy of Lancaster, the private estate of the UK's monarch, is also allegedly involved. The estate of Elizabeth II invested millions of dollars in medical and consumer loan companies, the files show.
While the estate's finance officer said in a statement that the "Duchy was aware" the fund was run offshore, the ICIJ said that it has "never disclosed details of its investments".
There is no suggestion the queen's estate acted illegally.
Queen Noor of Jordan; Uganda Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa; Brazil Foreign Minister Campos Meirelles and Yuri Milner, a Russian billionaire investor with large stakes in Facebook and Twitter are also named.
The Indian Express reported on Monday that the leak "reveals trails of India's corporates".
"India ranks 19th in terms of the number of names. In all, there are 714 Indians in the tally," said the newspaper, which received details of the leak.
Aside from the companies, the newspaper said Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan and the wife of actor Sanjay Dutt were involved.
Bachchan was a shareholder in a Bermuda-based digital media company, which is now closed.
The law firm Appleby insists there is no evidence of wrongdoing.
Why should anyone care?
While, in most cases, putting your money offshore and outside of your country's financial regulations is legal, many argue hiding from the tax man is unfair. Critics say governments have been slow to deal with it.
The amount of money involved is huge. Boston Consulting Group estimates $10 trillion are held in these offshore financial centres.
Most of us know them as tax havens, but few of us actually use them. That's because around half of that $10 trillion sum is concentrated not in the rich, but in the mega-rich. Think 0.001 percent of households.
But it is more than inequality and a lack of fairness. The offshore financial system is incredibly secretive - enabling the wealthy and powerful to hide their dealings and break the law.
BREAKING NEWS:
The queen does not invest in their own country.#ParadisePapers ‚Äî The Satire Party üé≠ (@TheSatireParty) November 6, 2017
"It's very difficult when somebody's using five or six different offshore jurisdictions to get a true picture of what they're really doing," said Sullivan, a journalist with the ICIJ. "And countries need that because law enforcement is not easy to cross borders, but crime can cross borders."
Leader of Britain's Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn also criticised tax avoidance, promising that if their party wins the next election it would clamp down on tax havens and end loopholes.
The reason our country is in a mess isn't because of immigrants. It's because over ¬£100bn per year is lost in tax havens. #paradisepapers ‚Äî James Melville (@JamesMelville) November 5, 2017
Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the UK's Green Party, tweeted: "Every year the political establishment try to play down tax avoidance and every year our public services suffer more cuts."
On the situation in India, Twitter user @Memeghnad said: "Dear fellow Indians, #paradisepapers proves that the super-rich have no political ideologies or affiliation. Their ideology is pure greed."
TV Reviews All of our TV reviews in one convenient place.
It's hard to get thrilling drama out of grief. Sadness saps energy, mutes passion, and forces character dynamics into a noose. Every scene has to acknowledge the emotion in some way, every conversation has to center around the loss, and the ache, and the person who will never come back, and while that's powerful stuff, and universal, it's not particularly fun to watch. Death in fiction can serve any number of ends, but mourning only really serves one, as it forces everyone to take a long hard look at their own lives, and remember that some day, they too will die. Maybe the reason it's so hard to make this work in fiction is because there's no real solution to it. When someone you care about dies, there's no fix, no clean answer that will make all the pain go away. Dead is dead, and the best we can hope for is to accept the inevitable, and do what we can to ignore it.

This isn't a problem that most shows have to face, since for most shows, death is a singular event. Bad stuff happens, a regular (or recurring guest star) gets killed, and we spend an hour showing clips, railing at God, and/or deciding to run for President again, and then we move on. It's not so easy for The Walking Dead, at least not the way the series has so far handled itself. These aren't just characters who can die; these are characters living in a world where death is actively hunting them down, where the social structures that create continuity and purpose in our lives no longer exist. The show has tried to deal with these facts as honestly as possible, and I suppose they should be commended for that. Unfortunately, a willingness to embrace the darker aspects of your premise doesn't necessarily lead to an ability to handle that darkness well. The Walking Dead has its failings, but this may be the worst of them: it keeps treading the same nihilistic ground and assuming it gets a pass for being ‚Äúdeep.‚Äù Too many conversations on this show sound like dialogue between a pair of college first-year student who just realized that, y'know, if we're all gonna die, like, what does all of this matter, man?
‚ÄúNebraska‚Äù doesn't entirely rectify this concern, but it's a solid hour of television, and a promising indication of where the series is headed. The episode picks up immediately after where ‚ÄúPretty Much Dead Already‚Äù left off, and a big portion of the plot is given over to dealing with the fallout from Shane's rash decision to let Hershel's barn zombies out into the open, and the discovery that Sophia was one of those zombies. So there's the usual recriminations, and Shane getting defensive, and for a large part of the hour, nothing really happens apart from people talking about how lousy everything is. But it works better than similar episodes the show has done in the past, because there's a stronger sense of action in the ensemble, one that changes them from aimless idiots waiting to get picked off, to really purposeful idiots, working together to take care of what needs to be done. Dale seems a bit less crazy (although apparently he's psychic now), Lori does something beyond tell everyone else how wrong they are (although they make some weird choices), and T-Dog has lines. Best of all, Rick acts like a protagonist ought to act. For the first time in ages, they have direction, and they get shit done. If this was the result, they should've been shooting little girls in the face weeks ago.
Of course, it wouldn't be The Walking Dead if people weren't doing dumb things for the sake of plot expedience. Soon after the mass shooting at the barn, and the silent, awkward burial that follows, Hershel lights out for town, having decided to take up a drinking habit which, unless I'm misremembering, had never been mentioned before. After one of farm folk takes ill (her name is Beth, but I still have no idea who anyone is in that group beyond Hershel and Maggie), and it suddenly becomes much more important to have a doctor in the house, so Rick decides to go get Hershel. That makes decent sense, especially considering that Hershel, most likely drunk and overcome with self-loathing and misery, isn't in the best frame of mind to keep themselves safe. Only everyone immediately acts like Rick is proposing some kind of suicide mission. Lori lectures them on how this isn't ‚Äúthe time,‚Äù and Maggie gets upset when Glenn volunteers to direct Rick to the local bar. As Glenn themselves points out, this is a run that they and others have made before, so why should it be such a problem now? And if Maggie is so worried about Glenn's safety, shouldn't they be doubly concerned for their father, an older man with every reason to have a bit of death wish?

The only reason there's conflict here is because the writers are apparently convinced every decision Rick makes needs to cause some kind of argument. (Well, no one is bothered by them shooting Sophia, so I guess they can mark that down as a win.) This becomes especially obvious when less than an hour later, Lori suddenly changes their mind and asks Daryl to go bring Hershel and their husband home. Yes, Beth's condition has changed for the worse, but the ease with which Lori changes their mind is baffling, and exposes how much their original argument existed largely for the sake of causing a fight. (Her logic that this day is somehow different than other days barely holds water. Yes, Sophia's death was a tragedy, but we never see Rick spending much time with their son or their wife, and the immediate threat is clearly resolved.) Hell, the only reason they turn to Daryl for help is so Daryl can show how Sophia's death has affected him. Sure, they justify why they want help from him, but it's still hard to ignore why the scene really exists: to give Daryl a chance to say ‚ÄúScrew you!‚Äù, and to make us wonder if they might not be heading down the path to the dark side. Of course, it also exists so that Lori is forced to drive into town on their own, so that they can, without the aid of Bluetooth or texting, crash their car. We'll have to see how that plays out next week, but the set-up is more than a little forced.
There are other flaws; Dale's magical ability to see exactly what happened to Otis is odd (although I forget what happened between Dale and Shane last episode‚Äîhow much did Shane say?), and Hershel and Rick's conversation in the bar is yet another example of how badly this show needs to learn to avoid getting too serious. But when I say ‚ÄúNebraska‚Äù by and large worked, I mean it. Giving the group a clear problem to overcome‚Äîhow to get rid of the bodies from the barn‚Äîmeant a lot of the action was focused on the straightforward challenges of living in a zombie-filled world. First they had to decide who to bury. Then graves had to be built, and once that part was finished, the remaining corpses had to be hauled off and burned. This was concrete, and it helped give form to the episode, something this series has often struggled with; baffling or half-assed subplots were kept to a minimum, and while we did get the usual debates in post-apocalypse ethics, at least those debates where centered on the problem at hand. (Do you realize we'll never have to listen to another argument about whether or not they should keep looking for Sophia? Glorious news.)
Best of all, Rick is becoming something of a bad-ass, which pays off nicely in the episode's strongest scene, a confrontation in town between Rick, Hershel, Glenn, and a pair of outsiders. While Rick is trying to convince Hershel to come back home, Dave and Tony pop their heads in the bar and start chatting up the room. They seem like nice enough guys‚Äîboth armed, but who isn't these days‚Äîand they're just looking for conversation. Except as the talk goes on, it becomes more and more obvious that Dave (played beautifully by Michael Raymond-James, who you might remember from Terriers, although that will probably make you sad) doesn't just want to talk. They and Tony are sick of wandering, and they want a new home, but there's something off about them. Tony casually takes a piss against a wall, and, sure, Dave is friendly, but it's not a trust-worthy kind of friendliness. Rick catches on immediately, Hershel does soon after, and it all builds to a shoot-out that leaves the two strangers dead.

This is one of the best scenes I've seen on the show so far, and it does any number of things that The Walking Dead has struggled with in the past. The tension builds naturally (due in no small part to Raymond-James), the dialogue has actual subtext, and there's a clear sense of risk here that never pauses to telegraph itself. There's no obvious and immediate proof that Dave and Tony are bad guys, but they're suspicious just the same, and the suspense comes from never knowing just how much of a threat they really pose. I've seen this sort of sequence play out in dozens of movies before (although there isn't much in the way of pop culture references, this has a Tarantino vibe to it, that sense of two men feeling each other out with words before they reach the point where violence is inevitable), but that didn't make this particular example any less exciting to watch. It reminded us that zombies aren't the only dangers in this world, and it solidified Rick's position as a guy who can do what needs to be done. This is a world where bad things keep happening, and the only way to make good stories out of that is to find ways to make sure those bad things are exciting, unexpected, and give our leads the chance to push back the darkness, if only for a little while.
Stray observations:
Anyone else gets a serious Lost vibe from all that body burying?
There are some good scenes with Shane here, too. I liked their conversation (which was really a monologue) with Carol a lot.
Glenn and Maggie have a decent chat about what happens next, and even Glenn and Rick's conversation in the car was great. Sure, Glenn busts out the ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù conundrum, which movies and shows always make more of a fuss about than is absolutely necessary, but Glenn explains their concerns well enough. Also a plus: they apologize to Rick for not telling them about Lori's pregnancy, and Rick is totally fine with it.
The arm falling off the truckload of corpses was a nice touch.

The ads for their university were classic Donald Trump -- Trump stares into the camera and proclaims:
"We're going to have professors and adjunct professors that are absolutely terrific people, terrific brains, successful. We are going to have the best of the best... and these are people that are handpicked by me."
But a CNN investigation finds that Trump and others involved in the school admitted under oath that some promises made to students just didn't happen.
In Trump's own deposition this past December, Trump failed to recognize the name of a single presenter or teacher at their real estate seminars. They also confirmed they had nothing to do with the selection process of instructors who taught at the school's events or mentors for the school's "Gold Elite" programs.
A review of Trump University presenters and so-called real estate experts found many with questionable credentials and inflated resumes. Court documents show background-checks conducted during the hiring process could not determine whether some instructors even graduated from high school.
Trump University brought in an estimated $40 million from up to 10,000 enrollees between 2005 and 2010, when the New York Department of Education said it was no longer allowed to call itself a university. The company changed its name to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative and shut down in 2011.
As Trump looks ahead to the general election, criticisms and legal battles over their unlicensed university continue to chase them on the campaign trail. A ruling this month means one lawsuit filed against Trump University in California -- which could potentially have had them take the stand as they were running for president -- now won't go to trial until November 28, after the election. Two others remain pending, but all three suits argue the program defrauded students with marketing schemes built on empty promises.
As the lawsuits move forward, so do the depositions. And it is in deposition, under oath, where the truth has emerged behind Trump's university, their lack of involvement in the school's curriculum and their lack of knowledge about who was hired to teach what was advertised as "Trump's Secrets" to real estate success.
The depositions were given by Trump and their former president of Trump University, business person Michael Sexton. Sexton came up with the idea in 2004 to put Donald Trump's brand on a real estate education seminar that was initially just online.
In a deposition for a lawsuit filed in New York, Sexton describes how they took the idea to Donald Trump through an intermediary and how Trump became so impressed with the business model, the billionaire invested $3 million and took a controlling interest. Sexton would be paid $250,000 a year to run the program, along with a cut of the profits.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is leading one of three lawsuits against Donald Trump and the defunct university, told CNN that Trump University was a "scam."
Schneiderman points to promotional videos made by Donald Trump in which Trump promises an education taught by their personal handpicked experts to teach Trump's exclusive methods for making money in real estate. Schneiderman insists Trump and Sexton contradict those claims when they are under oath.
"There wasn't one part of their pitch that was actually true," Schneiderman told CNN.
In a recently released deposition taken on July 25, 2012, Sexton, stated under oath: "None of our instructors at the live events were handpicked by Donald Trump."
Asked by attorneys if anyone at the Trump Organization was involved in the curriculum for the three-day real estate workshops, Sexton answered, "No."
Sexton confirmed Trump's lack of involvement in producing or reviewing the material used in the workshops. And on the specific promise of teaching Donald Trump's "proven secrets" in real estate, Sexton testified that the course taught strategies on how to invest in foreclosures, which Trump has used in the past.
"Mr. Trump has made investments with foreclosures. We cover investing with foreclosures," Sexton said.
Sexton testified Trump did have direct involvement in one part of the program -- advertising.
"He personally approved all the ads that were in newspapers," Sexton testified.
Sexton has not responded to CNN's multiple requests for comment.
Though they did not know a single instructor when a list of names was read to them during the deposition, Trump said in December they saw the resumes of some instructors but did not review them and instead left the hiring decisions to Sexton.
And in a telling exchange about Trump's lack of involvement with the school, Trump, as a witness in the case, admitted they knew little about the background and qualifications of Sexton himself.
Attorney: "And Mr. Sexton, they had no background in terms of buying and selling real estate for profit, did he?"
Trump: "He was more of an educational person"
Records show Michael Sexton, the president of Trump University, has spent almost their entire career in business and consulting, not education.
Trump's attorney Alan Garten said the "cherry picked" portions of depositions do not tell the entire story behind Trump's involvement in the program. In an email to CNN, Garten writes in part: "The vast majority of Trump University instructors were real estate experts," and added, "Mr. Trump not only met with the instructors and professors who designed the course, but also contributed to the curriculum."
More than 25% of the program's participants received refunds and more tried to get their money back but were denied, according to the firm leading one of the class-action suits against the university.
Garten gave CNN 14 affidavits written by students praising the program that they say provides evidence against the lawsuit's claims.
A student who wrote one of these affidavits told CNN that Trump University enabled them to cut better deals and manage bigger projects in commercial real estate.
"It opened my mind and put my knowledge up to another level," said Jesus Castillo, a real estate investor based in San Juan, Puerto Rico who supports Trump for president.
But records show Castillo filed for both Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010 and 2011 after enrolling in the program, respectively. Castillo attributes this to challenges related to the economic recession.
Another student, Charles Lee of North Arlington, New Jersey, said the Trump University courses they took in 2009 provided them with the know-how to start a business flipping residential properties, which they still run today.
Yet New York Attorney General Schneiderman counters that even if some former students don't recognize the fraud, Trump University scammed all paying participants.
"If you sell someone a Volkswagen and tell them it's a Rolls-Royce, it really doesn't matter if some people like their Volkswagen. It's still fraud," Schneiderman said.
George Hanus of Fremont, California, says they personally experienced that fraud.
Hanus says they progressively paid for stages of Trump University courses in 2008, believing each time that the next stage would offer Trump's secrets to success. But they say that information never materialized and their instructors did not follow through on their commitments.
"I just felt really duped," Hanus said.
Retired Navy veteran Felicisimo Limon loved Trump and believed the billionaire wanted them to achieve success, but after charging $26,000 to their credit card to enroll themselves and their wife in the program in 2008, they now feel differently.
Limon describes the course material as useless and devoid of any advanced real estate techniques. The one tip they do recall came from an instructor who detailed the benefits of paying off unpaid tax debts of elderly people -- keeping them in their homes until they die -- but then taking ownership of their properties.
"When I saw that teaching, you had to steal somebody's house? This is not right," Limon said. "We were ripped off."
Students may not be able to swing through the city skyline on spider webs, but they are one step closer to having consumer goods make out of spider silk.
Researchers and biotechnology companies have begun genetically modifying viable organisms, such as goats, to produce spider silk for consumer goods.
‚Äú‚ÄãSpider silk is simply a fascinating material, not only because of its potential use in a variety of human products, but because of its really interesting and unique natural history,‚Äù said Emma Dietrich, a graduate student in the UT Department of Integrative Biology.
Companies are in the early phases of developing spider silk products, but they plan to produce goods as soon as they figure out how to manufacture silk wholescale, according to Dietrich.
Dietrich will give a talk on the possibilities of spider silk at Science Under the Stars, which will be hosted at the Brackenridge Field Laboratory on Thursday.
Researchers have been studying the genetic makeup that allows 40,000 spider species to produce silk. A strand of spider silk is finer than a human hair, and five times stronger than steel of the same diameter.
Spider silk interests researchers because of its unique qualities, such elasticity, strength and low permeability. Because of these qualities, some companies have started seeking ways to adapt spider silk for human use in products such as bulletproof vests.
Spider silk is the ultimate biomaterial because it is strong yet biodegradable, according to the journal Nature Chemical Biology.
Though researchers speculate spider silk would be useful as a clothing material, they had difficulty harvesting enough silk to directly test durability in clothing until recently, according to Dietrich.
Different biotech companies and individual researchers have genetically modified other organisms, such as goats and silkworms, to produce spider silk.
A company called Spiber, located in Stockholm, Sweden, has genetically modified bacteria to produce the fibroin protein that makes up spider silk. To do this, they took a portion of the gene sequence that enables spiders to produce silk and cloned it into E. coli bacteria. Spiber can produce biomaterial silk in the forms of fiber, film, foam and mesh, according to their website.
The Center of PostNatural History, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has genetically modified goats called BioSteelTM Goats to do something similar, according their website. The goats were genetically modified by transferring the silk-coding gene from the golden orb spider into the goat's genome. This enabled the goat to produce silk in its milk, which scientists then harvested.
‚ÄúNow that researchers have come up with some new ways to produce artificial silk that are much faster and more feasible, I predict that in the next couple years, we will see a lot more direct testing of silk clothes,‚Äù
Dietrich said.

Federal Department scrambles to scrap Turnbull's 'exciting time' catchcry from government website
Updated
Federal bureaucrats have scrambled to erase the Prime Minister's "exciting time" catchcry from a Government website, amid claims it amounted to political advertising.
Labor in February this year referred the Government's $28 million Ideas Boom ad campaign to the Auditor-General.
The Opposition claimed the use of Malcolm Turnbull's "exciting time" phrase was inappropriate in a taxpayer-funded promotional blitz.
The Ideas Boom homepage originally prominently featured the phrase: "There's never been a more exciting time to be Australian."
But on March 8 this year the slogan was swapped for: "Welcome to the ideas boom."
An Innovation Department email trail, released under Freedom of Information (FOI) laws, shows public servants told a website developer to "fix" the site by removing the "exciting time" phrase "urgently".
"Small thing (but important to change): on the 'about' page can we replace 'There's never been a more exciting time to be an Australian' with 'Welcome to the Ideas Boom'," an email at 8:02am read.
The Department also phoned the contractor before sending a follow-up email at 12:01pm.
"We noticed that the 'There's never been a more exciting time to be an Australian' line of text has not been replaced on the website (as per email below and mentioned in the phone call this morning).
"Can we please get this resolved urgently? This is a high priority for us.
"Can you please give me an ETA on when this will be fixed?"
Documents show department knew phrase was inappropriate: Labor
Labor's "Waste Watch" spokesperson, Pat Conroy, said the documents showed the department knew using the "exciting time" phrase was wrong.
"Someone in the department, and maybe even the minister's office itself, realised that it was completely inappropriate for the Prime Minister's political slogan to be the centrepiece of a $28 million advertising campaign," they said.
"Clearly they cottoned on too late that they couldn't make it as directly obvious as linking the Prime Minister's key slogan into a publically-funded advertising campaign."
The Innovation Department campaign ran across television, online, social media and print.
The advertising spree came after the $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda was launched last December.
Innovation Department silent on why change was 'high priority'
The Innovation Department did not directly respond to questions from the ABC, instead referring to a response it provided the Auditor-General.
"The website was in the process of being redeveloped in early March 2016," the department said.
"The line 'There's never been a more exciting time to be Australian' was originally included on the innovation.gov.au website.
"On March 8 the line in question was replaced with 'Welcome to the Ideas Boom'.
"[This] is the campaign tagline that had been promoted heavily ... and, therefore, achieved a high level of awareness and recognition amongst target audiences."
It sounds like a scene from the ABC comedy Utopia: Labor
Mr Conroy said the emails sounded like something from the ABC's public service satire, Utopia.
"I think there would have been a lot of panic, a lot of sweating on website developers paying attention," Mr Conroy said.
"I could almost picture a scene out of the ABC's Utopia, realising they'd incurred the displeasure of department, in fact, possibly even minister's office.
"It would have been a scene of high tension and possibly comic relief."

LOUISVILLE, Ky. ‚Äì Forecasts of rain had caused some pause ahead of Thursday night's Louisville City home game.
It was just the second home date for Orlando City's USL affiliate at Slugger Field in downtown Louisville, and after drawing more than 6,000 fans for the opener, Louisville City's administration was hoping to see the momentum continue.
The rain never came, but the fans certainly did.
More than 4,700 were in attendance for Louisville City's 1-1 midweek draw with the Rochester Rhinos, and team officials hope it's an indication that the market will continue to support the newest professional team in town.
There is also a bit of pressure to continue the USL legacy of the affiliate club, of course.
‚ÄúI can really appreciate what Orlando did in such short order,‚Äù said Louisville City owner Wayne Estopinal, a minority owner of Orlando City. ‚ÄúHaving the experience from Orlando has been a huge help being able to call on the folks in the front office there. It's really shortened our learning curve a little bit, but it's still been an enormous undertaking here.‚Äù
Paul Tenorio The sunset over Slugger Field during a recent Louisville City game. The sunset over Slugger Field during a recent Louisville City game. (Paul Tenorio)
Louisville City (1-0-2) remains unbeaten through three games even though no Orlando City players have appeared yet for the affiliate club. The Lions do plan on sending players up to Kentucky ‚Äì they already loaned rookie forward Sidney Rivera, who has been held out due to a groin injury ‚Äì but international call-ups and injuries have prevented Orlando City from dispatching anyone else just yet.
Defenders Conor Donovan and Tommy Redding and midfielders Estrela and Harrison Heath are among the candidates to be sent to the USL affiliate at some point just to get game minutes.
Meanwhile, Louisville City has continued to build its brand in a city with the right demographics to support soccer.
‚ÄúWe're obviously very pleased,‚Äù said Louisville City coach James O'Connor, the former Orlando City player-coach. ‚ÄúThe support base has been excellent, I think the fans have been tremendous. ‚Ä¶ We're a brand-new team, we still have a little bit of learning to do, but we're pleased with how we've started.‚Äù
The team shares Slugger Field with the Louisville Bats, the Triple-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. For game days, turf is laid down over the dirt infield and the pitcher's mound is lowered underground using a retractable mound designed by Estopinal's architecture firm.
It's not an ideal surface ‚Äì the turf to grass transitions are unique ‚Äì but the situation has worked thus far.
‚ÄúWe did a beta test on the turf before the first game, took it all up and put it down again, and we got better the second time,‚Äù Estopinal said. ‚ÄúThis is the third time that turf's been down. We're still refining that, but I think it's worked. ‚Ä¶ We're getting better, but it's a pretty unique setting to take a baseball stadium and turn it into this, and I think it looks pretty good.‚Äù
Plans are in the works to shut down an entire street downtown for pregame festivities and a march to the match, and the purple supporters group ‚Äì the Louisville Coopers ‚Äì are reminiscent of the grassroots movement that took Orlando City from USL to MLS in less than five years.
After two encouraging crowds to start the season and with a growing fanbase, Louisville City clearly has a bit of its MLS partner's DNA.

McDonald's argues that the sign used to invite patrons to "McDragan's Drive In!" strip tease bar in Edsv√§ra near Falk√∂ping, is far too similar to its own logo and have demanded that it be removed without delay.
"We're going to send them a letter. In our view this is clearly a breach of our trademark," McDonald's spokesperson Claes Eliasson told The Local.
But the strip tease club owner, Dragan Bratic, denied that there was any likeness.
"The sign has nothing to do with McDonald's. It is two breasts with nipples. Anyone can see that," Bratic told Swedish online newspaper GT.se.
When asked about the name McDragan's, Bratic replied that the Mc in fact stands for motorcycle and bears no relation to the Mc in McDonald's.
"I'm not Irish, I'm a Yugoslav. And I don't sell hamburgers, I sell live striptease," they insist.
But if Dragan Bratic does not take down their sign in the coming days, Claes Eliasson warns that McDonald's will pursue the matter through legal channels.
Story highlights The Taliban are responsible for the bombing, a spokesperson for the group says
An Afghan Interior Ministry spokesperson says the blast happened in the Justice Ministry's parking lot
(CNN) Four Afghan civilians were killed and 24 more wounded in a suicide bombing Tuesday afternoon outside Afghanistan's Justice Ministry, an Afghan Interior Ministry spokesperson said.
An explosives-laden vehicle was detonated in the Justice Ministry's parking lot around 4 p.m. (7:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday, according to the government spokesperson, Sediq Sediqqi.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesperson for the militant group, Zabiullah Mujahid, said it killed and wounded high- and low-ranking Justice Ministry officials.
The Taliban's involvement is hardly a surprise. A U.S.-led military offensive ousted the group from power in Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, attacks . But since then, the Taliban have carried out similar violence almost continuously, including two recent attacks on the Afghan attorney general's office.
On Sunday, Mujahid said their group was behind a suicide car bombing near Hamid Karzai International Airport that killed four people, one of them a British citizen.

Them novel The Fountainhead is one of the few works of fiction that Donald Trump likes and they have long been the darling of the US right. But only now do their devotees hold sway around the world
As they plough through their GCSE revision, UK students planning to take politics A-level in the autumn can comfort themselves with this thought: come September, they will be studying one thinker who does not belong in the dusty archives of ancient political theory but is achingly on trend. For the curriculum includes a new addition: the work of Ayn Rand.
It is a timely decision because Rand, who died in 1982 and was alternately ridiculed and revered throughout their lifetime, is having a moment. Long the poster girl of a particularly hardcore brand of free-market fundamentalism ‚Äì the advocate of a philosophy they called ‚Äúthe virtue of selfishness‚Äù ‚Äì Rand has always had acolytes in the conservative political classes. The Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, is so committed a Randian, they were famous for giving every new member of their staff a copy of Rand's gargantuan novel, Atlas Shrugged (along with Freidrich Hayek's Road to Serfdom). The story, oft-repeated, that their colleague in the US Senate, Rand Paul, owes their first name to their father Ron's adulation of Ayn (it rhymes with ‚Äúmine‚Äù) turns out to be apocryphal, but Paul describes themselves as a fan all the same.
Not to be left out, Britain's small-staters have devised their own ways of worshipping at the shrine of Ayn. Communities secretary Sajid Javid reads the courtroom scene in Rand's The Fountainhead twice a year and has done so throughout their adult life. As a student, they read that bit aloud to the woman who is now their wife, though the exercise proved to be a one-off. As Javid recently confessed to the Spectator, they told them that if they tried that again, they would get dumped. Meanwhile, Daniel Hannan, the Tory MEP many see as the intellectual architect of Brexit, keeps a photograph of Rand on their Brussels desk.

So the devotion of Toryboys, in both their UK and US incarnations, is not new. But Rand's philosophy of rugged, uncompromising individualism ‚Äì of contempt for both the state and the lazy, conformist world of the corporate boardroom ‚Äî now has a follower in the White House. What is more, there is a new legion of devotees, one whose influence over our daily lives dwarfs that of most politicians. They are the titans of tech.
So who is this new entrant on the A-level syllabus, the woman hailed by one biographer as the goddess of the market? Born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum in 1905 in St Petersburg, Russia, they saw their father impoverished and their family driven to the brink of starvation by the Soviet revolution, an experience that forged their contempt for all notions of the collective good and, especially, for the state as a mechanism for ensuring equality.
An obsessive cinemagoer, they fled to the US in 1926, swiftly making their way to Hollywood. They paid their way through a series of odd jobs, including a stint in the costume department of RKO Pictures, and landed a role as an extra in Cecil B DeMille's The King of Kings. But writing was their passion. Broadway plays and movie scripts followed, until the breakthrough came with a novel: The Fountainhead.
How Ayn Rand became the new right's version of Marx | George Monbiot Read more
Published in 1943, it tells the story of Howard Roark, an architect dedicated to the pursuit of their own vision ‚Äì a man who would rather see their buildings dynamited than compromise on the perfection of their designs. All around them are mediocrities, representing either the dead hand of the state, bureaucrats serving some notional collective good, or ‚Äúsecond handers‚Äù ‚Äì corporate parasites who profit from the work and vision of others.
Then, in 1957, came Atlas Shrugged, whose Penguin Classic edition stretches to 1,184 pages. Here Roark gives way to John Galt, another capitalist genius, who leads a strike by the ‚Äúmen of talent‚Äù and drive, thereby depriving society of ‚Äúthe motor of the world‚Äù.
In those novels, and in the essays and lectures they turned to afterwards, Rand expounded ‚Äì at great and repetitive length ‚Äì their philosophy, soon to be taught to A-level students alongside Hobbes and Burke. Objectivism, they called it, distilled by them as the belief that ‚Äúman exists for their own sake, that the pursuit of their own happiness is their highest moral purpose, that they must not sacrifice themselves to others, nor sacrifice others to himself‚Äù. They had lots to say about everything else too ‚Äì an avowed atheist, they were dismissive of any knowledge that was not rooted in what you could see in front of your eyes. They had no patience for ‚Äúinstinct‚Äù or ‚Äú‚Äòintuition' ‚Ä¶ or any form of ‚Äòjust knowing'‚Äù.

The Fountainhead was serially rejected and published to ambivalent reviews, but it became a word-of-mouth hit. Over the coming years, a cult following arose around Rand (as well as something very close to an actual cult among their inner circle, known, no doubt ironically, as the Collective). Them works struck a chord with a particular kind of reader: adolescent, male and thirsting for an ideology brimming with moral certainty. As the New Yorker said in 2009: ‚ÄúMost readers make their first and last trip to Galt's Gulch ‚Äì the hidden-valley paradise of born-again capitalists featured in Atlas Shrugged, its solid-gold dollar sign standing like a maypole ‚Äì sometime between leaving Middle-earth and packing for college.‚Äù
But for some, objectivism stuck. Perhaps their most significant early follower was Alan Greenspan, later to serve as chairperson of the US Federal Reserve for 19 years. In the 1950s, Greenspan was one of the Collective, and they would be among the mourners at their funeral in 1982, where one floral wreath was fashioned into that same 6ft dollar sign, now understood to be the logo of Randism.
Greenspan is the link between the original Rand cult and what we might think of as the second age of Rand: the Thatcher-Reagan years, when the laissez-faire, free-market philosophy went from the crankish obsession of rightwing economists to the governing credo of Anglo-American capitalism. Greenspan, appointed as the US's central banker by Ronald Reagan in 1987, firmly believed that market forces, unimpeded, were the best mechanism for the management and distribution of a society's resources. That view ‚Äì which Greenspan would rethink after the crash of 2008-9 ‚Äì rested on the assumption that economic actors behave rationally, always acting in their own self-interest. The primacy of self-interest, rather than altruism or any other nonmaterial motive, was, of course, a central tenet of Randian thought.
Put more baldly, the reason why Republicans and British Conservatives started giving each other copies of Atlas Shrugged in the 80s was that Rand seemed to grant intellectual heft to the prevailing ethos of the time. Them insistence on the ‚Äúmorality of rational self-interest‚Äù and ‚Äúthe virtue of selfishness‚Äù sounded like an upmarket version of the slogan, derived from Oliver Stone's Wall Street, that defined the era: greed is good. Rand was Gordon Gekko with A-levels.

The third age of Rand came with the financial crash and the presidency of Barack Obama that followed. Spooked by the fear that Obama was bent on expanding the state, the Tea Party and others returned to the old-time religion of rolling back government. As Rand biographer Jennifer Burns told Quartz: ‚ÄúIn moments of liberal dominance, people turn to them because they see Atlas Shrugged as a prophecy as to what's going to happen if the government is given too much power.‚Äù
In that context, it seemed only natural that one of the success stories of the 2012 presidential campaign was a bid for the Republican nomination by the ultra-libertarian and Rand-admiring Texas member of congress Ron Paul, father of Senator Rand Paul, whose insurgent movement was a forerunner for much of what would unfold in 2016. Paul offered a radical downsizing of the federal government. Like Ayn Rand, they believed the state's role should be limited to providing an army, a police force, a court system ‚Äì and not much else.
But Rand presented a problem for US Republicans otherwise keen to embrace their legacy. They were a devout atheist, withering in their disdain for the nonobjectivist mysticism of religion. Yet, inside the Republican party, those with libertarian leanings have only been able to make headway by riding pillion with social conservatives and, specifically, white evangelical Christians. The dilemma was embodied by Paul Ryan, named as Mitt Romney's running mate in the 2012 contest. Ryan moved fast to play down the Rand influence, preferring to say their philosophy was inspired by St Thomas Aquinas.
Confessions of a recovering Objectivist | Victoria Bekiempis Read more
What of the current moment, shaping up to be the fourth age of Rand? The Randian politicians are still in place: Ryan is now boosted by a cabinet crammed with objectivists. Secretary of state Rex Tillerson named Atlas Shrugged as their favourite book, while Donald Trump's first choice (later dropped) as labor secretary, Andy Puzder, is the CEO of a restaurant chain owned by Roark Capital Group ‚Äì a private equity fund named after the hero of The Fountainhead. CIA director Mike Pompeo is another conservative who says Atlas Shrugged ‚Äúreally had an impact on me‚Äù.
Of course, this merely makes these men like their boss. Trump is notoriously no reader of books: they have only ever spoken about liking three works of fiction. But, inevitably, one of them was The Fountainhead. ‚ÄúIt relates to business, beauty, life and inner emotions. That book relates to ... everything,‚Äù they said last year.
Rand scholars find this affinity of Trump's puzzling. Not least because Trump's offer to the electorate in 2016 was not a promise of an unfettered free market. It was a pledge to make the US government an active meddler in the market, negotiating trade deals, bringing back jobs. Their public bullying of big companies ‚Äì pressing Ford or the air-conditioner manufacturer Carrier to keep their factories in the US ‚Äì was precisely the kind of big government intrusion upon the natural rhythms of capitalism that appalled Rand.
So why does Trump claim to be inspired by her? The answer, surely, is that Rand lionises the alpha male capitalist entrepreneur, the man of action who towers over the little people and the pettifogging bureaucrats ‚Äì and gets things done. As Jennifer Burns puts it: ‚ÄúFor a long time, they have been beloved by disruptors, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, people who see themselves as shaping the future, taking risky bets, moving out in front of everyone else, relying only on their own instincts, intuition and knowledge, and going against the grain.‚Äù

Which brings us to the new wave of Randians, outside both politics and conventional conservatism. They are the princes of Silicon Valley, the masters of the start-up, a cadre of young Roarks and Galts, driven by their own genius to remake the world and damn the consequences.
So it should be no surprise that when Vanity Fair surveyed these tycoons of the digital age, many of them pointed to a single guiding star. Rand, the magazine suggested, might just be ‚Äúthe most influential figure in the industry‚Äù. When the CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick, had to choose an avatar for their Twitter account in 2015, they opted for the cover of The Fountainhead. Peter Thiel, Facebook's first major investor and a rare example of a man who straddles both Silicon Valley and Trumpworld, is a Randian. Meanwhile, Steve Jobs is said by their Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, to have regarded Atlas Shrugged as one of their ‚Äúguides in life‚Äù.
Among these new masters of the universe, the Rand influence is manifest less in party political libertarianism than in a single-minded determination to follow a personal vision, regardless of the impact. No wonder the tech companies don't mind destroying, say, the taxi business or the traditional news media. Such concerns are beneath the young, powerful men at the top: even to listen to such concerns would be to betray the singularity of their own pure vision. It would be to break Rand's golden rule, by which the visionary must never sacrifice themselves to others.
So Rand, dead 35 years, lives again, their hand guiding the rulers of our age in both Washington and San Francisco. Hers is an ideology that denounces altruism, elevates individualism into a faith and gives a spurious moral licence to raw selfishness. That it is having a moment now is no shock. Such an ideology will find a ready audience for as long as there are human beings who feel the rush of greed and the lure of unchecked power, longing to succumb to both without guilt. Which is to say: for ever.

When Anthony Commarota was 3, their stepfather showed them how to juggle ‚Äî and ‚ÄúI just kind of picked it up quick,‚Äù they say.
By the time they were 8, Commarota had become one of the best jugglers in the world, appearing on the ABC variety show ‚ÄúThat's Incredible.‚Äù In front of a studio audience, they juggled a succession of balls, clubs and rings for more than 2 minutes without missing. Their finale, juggling five rings while twirling another ring on their foot and balancing a ladder and a ball on their head, was flawless.
A few years later, wearing a pair of baby blue shorts that accentuated their skinny legs and knobby knees, Commarota juggled on the ‚ÄúTonight Show.‚Äù Guest host Joan Rivers called them ‚Äúterrific‚Äù and ‚Äúadorable‚Äù and told them they were a ‚Äúlovely boy.‚Äù
When they asked them what they wanted to be when they grew up, Commarota did not hesitate.
‚ÄúA juggler,‚Äù they told them
And they became one ‚Äî not just making a good living, but becoming arguably the greatest juggler in the world. Performing under the name Anthony Gatto, they came to hold 12 juggling records, including juggling nine balls for 54 seconds and juggling 12 rings for 12 catches. In 2000, they won a prestigious Golden Clown trophy at the International Circus Festival of MonteCarlo. No other juggler has won that award. In 2007, they joined Cirque du Soleil and juggled in the Kooza show in Las Vegas and the La Nouba show in Orlando.
Throughout much of their career, however, Commarota hid a big secret. On stage, they smiled amid the bright lights and bouncy music. Inside was another truth: They just didn't like juggling for a living.
‚ÄúAs good as I was, I don't feel like that was my world,‚Äù says Commarota, now 42 and living in Orlando. ‚ÄúAll along, I did the best I could ‚Äî 100% ‚Äî and I was a top-level artist, but it was never really that fulfilling for me. All the awards and accolades didn't really mean that much.‚Äù They tried quitting in their early 20s.
They started a landscaping company but didn't know much about running a business. When money got tight and it looked like the business would fail, they went back to juggling ‚Äî not because they missed it, but because it was the best way for them to secure their finances.
Commarota quit juggling the second time at 40. In addition to lacking passion for performing, they had another reason. With a wife and two kids, life as a professional juggler didn't allow them to be the kind of husband and father they wanted to be.
‚ÄúI didn't want to see myself going down that path of missing my kids' entire lives while I'm sitting in a dressing room getting ready for a show,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúSo, I started to think about things and I looked around and thought about what it was that I was interested in.‚Äù
That turned out to be concrete.
Commarota created Big Top Concrete Resurfacing in 2012. The business is growing. People think it's funny or weird that the world's greatest juggler is a concrete guy now, but they say the two fields aren't all that different. On stage, they considered themselves an artist, always thinking up new tricks to challenge himself, and they say that's what they do now. If a customer wants a plain concrete floor or counter, they can create that, but they can also make concrete look like wood planks, adobe tile, sand, water, slate.
Whatever you want, they can do.
‚ÄúI'm constantly thinking, constantly creating,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúThat's what I like about it.‚Äù
They don't miss juggling at all. The past two years, in fact, they remember only juggling once ‚Äî because their children had friends over and they were desperate to keep them occupied. They impressed the kids by juggling seven balls, but even that wasn't much fun. ‚ÄúIt's not inside me,‚Äù they say.
‚ÄúSome people can't ever escape the stage. They love it, and good for them. But I feel lucky because I get to do something different from the one thing I grew up doing since I was 3 years old. I get to learn something new and do something entirely different, and I love it.‚Äù

Brett Favre never lacked for confidence when they played. But now that he's a Hall of Famer, he's not quite sure they belong.
‚ÄúI get that I'm about to be a member of this exclusive club, but it hasn't sunk in,‚Äù Favre said during their press conference Friday.
For all the well-wishes, and walking the aisle at the Gold Jacket Dinner last night, the former Packers quarterback said it was a note they got recently from a fellow member of the Hall which took them aback.
Favre said former Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach emailed, sending their regrets for not being able to attend this weekend. And because they grew up a Cowboys fans, the idea that one of their heroes was now in their inbox shook him.
‚ÄúI had to pick my jaw off the floor,‚Äù Favre said of the message.
But for a guy who always played with tremendous confidence, reflecting on their current status was hard for him.
‚ÄúI don't know if I'll ever feel like an equal to these guys,‚Äù Favre said.
Of course, the three straight Most Valuable Player awards and all their passing records say differently.
When Aarushie came across a pack of tarot cards in a mall, they just could not stop themselves from not only buying them but also making up their mind to learn the art of reading them in due course.
Akanksha Madan was similarly attracted to the power of tarot when they saw a person getting their tarot reading done. Intrigued by the art, they went ahead to experience it and later decided to learn it to read the cards on their own.
The trend of reading tarot has caught up amongst youngsters who look upon these mystic cards as their healer. More so, when faced with crucial decisions in their personal and professional lives. The issues which they find hard to discuss with parents, peers or friends.
Tarot, then, comes to the rescue of these youngsters in search of guidance.
Yashima Khanna, a 24-year-old says, ‚ÄúI bought a pack of tarot and it had a book along with it describing what each card means. Since then, I have been reading tarot cards for my friends. It makes for an interesting time pass and directs us to be aware of our impending future.‚Äù This usually begins as a hobby but some have gone ahead to master the art professionally.
Even those who have taken up a subject like psychology are not untouched by their mystique. For instance, Aka¬≠n¬≠k¬≠sha Madan, a post-graduate in clinical psychology says, ‚ÄúAfter I came to know of this art, I used to get my tarot reading done once in a month. Seven months later, I made up my mind to learn it, so as to read my cards myself.‚Äù
Having learnt the art, Akan¬≠k¬≠sha feels that it has had positive effects on their personality. ‚ÄúTarot calms you down as an individual. It does forecast but at the same time makes you a better person. The prediction warns you and if you remain subdued during trouble, you will not only sail through it but also learn patience.‚Äù
Aarushie, a 25-year-old, shares that they were studying tourism from College of Vocational Studies, DU when their attraction towards tarot cards changed the course of their career.
‚ÄúWhen I was a kid, I used to get visions but wasn't aware of their significance. By the
time I turned 16, I started getting attracted towards alternative healing therapies and during my graduation, my enc¬≠o¬≠unter with tarot gave a new dimension to my existence. I realised that I am born to help people.‚Äù
Thus, after first year of graduation, they started learning it professionally. ‚ÄúI have been practicing tarot reading since 2007 and now there is no looking back.‚Äù
For the first time, a Syrian refugee gave birth in an Israeli hospital on Sunday. The woman, a 20-year-old nurse, came across the border alone, and gave birth to a healthy 3.2-kilogram (7 pound) boy.
When the woman felt the baby coming, they were stuck in their home near Quneitra, with no access to a Syrian hospital and no medical care in the town. So they decided to take a huge risk for the sake of their unborn child, and made their way to the border.
‚ÄúI feared for the baby's welfare if the birth went through complications at home,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúTo my joy, the Israeli army saw I was suffering from terrible pains, and picked me up and transferred me to the hospital.‚Äù

When the IDF found them on the border Saturday night, they were already in labor. They brought them to Ziv Medical Center in Safed, where many of the dozens of Syrian medical cases brought into Israel are treated.
Since they came across the border with no family, midwives at the hospital took their place, holding their hands and coaching them through the birth. ‚ÄúAt the end of the birth they thanked everyone and hugged everyone with joy,‚Äù one of the nurses said.
‚ÄúThe team of Israeli midwives and doctors treated me with sensitivity and respect,‚Äù noted the mother.
‚ÄúShe received warm and embracing care from the entire birthing staff,‚Äù said Mira Eli, a nurse in the birthing room at Ziv, ‚Äújust like every mother needs ‚Äî and even more.‚Äù
After surviving on a rice diet for the past two months, the mother received meat and vegetables at the hospital.
‚ÄúI really don't feel like I'm in an enemy country; everyone is helping me and caring for me,‚Äù they told Channel 2. (Syria and Israel are formally at war, and have fought three major conflicts ‚Äî in 1948, 1967 and 1973.)
Since February, over 250 Syrian civilians have been admitted to Israeli hospitals for treatment. Many less serious cases have been treated by Israeli medical teams at an IDF field hospital in the Golan Heights.
Israel has said it offers the care as an act of humanitarian assistance, while endeavoring to stay out of the Syrian war, in which an estimated 100,000 people have been killed since March 2011.
China is set to launch the first test of its Tianzhou-1 cargo and resupply spacecraft in April, in what will be a crucial test of key technologies needed for the country's future space station.
China is set to launch the first test of its Tianzhou-1 cargo and resupply spacecraft in April, in what will be a crucial test of key technologies needed for the country's future space station.
The 13-tonne Tianzhou-1 will be launched by a new Long March 7 rocket from Wenchang in April, and dock soon after with the orbiting Tiangong-2 space lab 390 kilometres above the Earth.
The 9m long, 3.35m diameter Tianzhou spacecraft has a 6,500 kg cargo capacity and has been specifically designed for refuelling and resupplying the future Chinese Space Station (CSS), the core module of which will launch in 2018.
The main objective of the Tianzhou-1 mission is to test and verify on-orbit transfer of liquid propellant to Tiangong-2, which late last year hosted two astronauts for China's longest human spaceflight mission so far.
If successful, Tianzhou-1 will be another major step towards China establishing a permanent human presence in space, with the CSS planned to be completed by 2022.
Above: Tianzhou-1 and Tiangong-2 components at the spacecraft AIT Centre in Tianjin (CASC).
Space rendezvous
Tianzhou-1 (Â§©Ëàü or 'heavenly vessel') and its Long March 7 carrier rocket recently passed key development and manufacturing reviews and will in February be shipped from Tianjin to the Wenchang Space Launch Centre on the southern island province of Hainan.
Rendezvous and docking with Tiangong-2 will occur 3-5 days after launch ‚Äì much slower than the two days taken crewed Shenzhou spacecraft take to dock with space labs.
Li Jian of the Beijing Aerospace Control Centre explains that this approach requires less fuel, and thus more can be transferred to the target.
Above: The Long March 7 to launch Tianzhou-1 being prepared in Tianjin (CASC).
China is the third country to independently master rendezvous and docking, and the docking system for Tianzhou missions has been upgraded to facilitate the transfer of liquid propellant.
The Tianzhou-1 mission will also test a 6-hour fast rendezvous and docking procedure, according to Go-Taikonauts, an independent report on the Chinese space programme.
The various pressurised, semi-pressurised and unpressurised compartments of Tianzhou will allow food, supplies, space equipment and experiments to be delivered to the CSS, along with the propellant required to maintain its orbit.
The spacecraft can also be used to remove waste from the CSS, which will then burn up in the atmosphere along with the deorbited Tianzhou vessel.
Long march to the Chinese Space Station
The CSS will consist of three 20-tonne modules and be able to host up to six astronauts, with groups of three staying for around six months each.
China embarked on a programme to develop human spaceflight capabilities in 1992, with the ultimate goal of a modular space station.
The uncrewed test of the Shenzhou capsule and Long March 2F launcher in 1999, and Yang Liwei became the first Chinese national in space in 2003, and ten more astronauts have followed him, with each Shenzhou crewed mission building on the last.
Following missions achieved the first two-person flights, first spacewalk, first three-person flights and the first docking, with Shenzhou-9 and Tiangong-1 in 2012, which also included the first Chinese female astronaut, Liu Yang.
In October 2016 Jing Haipeng and Chen Dong doubled the national spaceflight record by spending over 30 days in space, mostly aboard Tiangong-2, the country's second testbed for the CSS.
Last year also saw the debut of the next-generation Long March 7 and the massive Long March 5 rocket, the latter of which is required for lifting the large CSS modules into low Earth orbit.
Long March 5 will also launch China's second major mission of 2017 in November, sending the 8.2 tonne Chang'e-5 probe to collect lunar regolith from the Moon and return the samples to China.
The Chinese Space Station will also be accompanied in orbit by a free-flying Hubble-class space telescope, which can dock with the CSS for repairs and maintenance.
The CSS will also be open to collaboration with other nations, especially developing countries, following an agreement with the United Nations.
Science goals
Tianzhou-1 is also kitted out with a range of science experiments in addition to those already running on Tiangong-2.
These science payloads include a cell bioreactor to test the influence of microgravity on mammalian cells including the development of different embryonic stem cells, and a two-phase fluid instrument for spacecraft fluid management.
Another, an electrostatic levitation accelerometer, aims to study the unexplained vast difference in the strength of the weak force and gravity, and explore potential forces predicted by theories suggesting extra dimensions.
The mission is currently expected but not confirmed to launch around mid-April, with new details such as mission duration likely to be announced during China's annual parliamentary sessions in early March.
Massachusetts voters officially have more options when casting their presidential ballots in November. On Monday, former Gov. William Welddelivered thousands of voter signatures to the state elections office to qualify the Libertarian ticket for the ballot. Weld and former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson plan to take the third-party path to the White House. Weld told reporters on Monday that ‚Äúthe ice is cracking a little bit.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust this week, I've spoken with a few Republican members of Congress who are interested in reassessing their endorsements for the fall,‚Äù Weld said, according to The Boston Globe .

Madalyn Murray-O'Hair announces that they and their son, Jon Garth Murray, have filed suit to prevent Pope John Paul II from saying Mass on the Mall in Washington, D.C., when they visit the United States in October.
According to O'Hair, director of the American Atheist Center in Austin, Texas, it was unconstitutional for the pope to be granted a permit to hold a religious ritual on public land. They argue that they should instead say mass on some of the billions of dollars of land owned by the Roman Catholic Church.
Madalyn Murray-O'Hair also adds that Pope John Paul II is a "vicious and unprincipled man" who is guilty of crimes against women and should be brought up on charges before the United Nations.
The ACLU is also interested in the issue, but primarily with regards to whether any public funds are used to support the event.
Parliamentary hearings into the scandal involving NSA spying on Germany have started. Some members of the investigative committee have suggested bringing in the document leaker Edward Snowden themselves to testify. Some expect this to anger Washington.
The Bundestag presented the evidence on Thursday, as German public anger over America's blatant violations of German sovereignty vents steam. But some are already speculating what the result of the hearings will mean in practical terms, for German-US relations. And what political fallout will ensue by inviting Snowden to Berlin?
Fresh revelations regarding the NSA's activities in Germany continue to pour in amid outcries from the German people. Der Spiegel magazine has published further Snowden leaks recently, among them the revelation that the Americans compiled a comprehensive dossier on Merkel, which included over 300 intelligence reports. Apparently, the NSA database contains information obtained during surveillance of over a hundred world leaders.
What's more, the magazine detailed how British secret services also played a part in all this, by hacking into German internet companies.
Clemense Binninger, who is tasked with leading the eight-person investigative committee, does not expect the US to help much in clearing up the surveillance allegations, and believes attempts to formulate a Washington-Berlin no-spy agreement have come to a complete halt, Deustsche Welle reports. Questions the German government sent to the US government have likewise not received a reply ‚Äì and the head of the committee doesn't see this changing anytime soon. But Binninger, who is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party, said ‚Äúmass surveillance of citizens will not be tolerated.‚Äù
The committee chair believes getting at least some response from the Americans would be ‚Äúan important step forward to restoring trust.‚Äù However, this is where their power ends, as the committee can do little more than examine evidence. They can neither compel the US or Britain to play a more active role in helping, nor do they have the authority to summon foreign witnesses to Germany to testify.
And this is where the disagreements arise. Konstantin von Notz of the Green Party first filed a motion to subpoena Snowden and get them to Berlin for a testimony. Given Snowden's key role nine months ago in leaking the history-changing documents, this is seen as a matter of paramount importance.
And Snowden is willing to testify, as von Notz's Green Party colleagues visiting the former NSA contractor in Moscow found out. But Binninger themselves isn't sure how much help they could offer, since the computer wizard themselves said they don't know much more than what is being revealed. And it's been said that their answers to earlier questions by the EP were quite general.
Other members of the committee are just as serious about getting Snowden's take on the NSA's role in the surveillance on the German political apparatus. Patrick Sensburg, an MP from the CDU, suggested that some document exchange be facilitated between cooperating journalists as a substitute for Snowden traveling to Berlin.
Others are pressing harder for direct talks with Snowden. Martina Renner of the Left Party believes the ‚Äúknowledge in Snowden's head‚Äù can only be accessed by direct questioning.
The inquiry will be very thorough, and German politicians expect to spend two more months studying documents before a decision on summoning Snowden is reached. But even then, the time frame for actually getting Snowden there has been set at two years; it's difficult at the moment to see where Snowden's place in the inquiry will be.
And they would have other things to consider, namely ‚Äì would it be wise to risk a limited testimony from Snowden over further souring relations with the West, who have an arrest warrant out for the document leaker and readily accuse anyone of colluding with the enemy if Snowden's name is so much as mentioned?
A top German prosecutor is also deciding whether to open a full-scale criminal investigation against the NSA ‚Äì another way to go about the issue.
Some, though, think that this is unlikely, because it would contribute to increasing German-US tensions at a time when both are trying to stir up a unified effort against Russia for its alleged actions in Ukraine.
In either case, the committee has said that its inquiry will also deal with the broader questions of intelligence work, such as what the limitations on international cooperation are, what the US is allowed to do regarding Germany, how deep did the knowledge of NSA snooping on German officials run in domestic circles, and others.
Benninger also believes that a discussion on the place of data gathering on citizens in today's world will be beneficial for redirecting the focus from all-out data-mining to more streamlined identity checks.
14 Industry Luminaries (and an Ode) on the State of Bitcoin 2016
Call them what you want; dignitaries, pundits, bigwigs, luminaries or ‚Äì even ‚Äì enemies. There are always headstrong debates raging on in the Bitcoin space, and some people's names get tossed around more than other's. We decided to reach out to a few of them and ask them a simple question.

Bitcoin has been on a tear all year long, surprising many mainstream spectators. The digital asset has outperformed all sovereign fiat currencies, and gold, over the past year. There have been many headlines ‚Äì both negative and positive ‚Äìsurrounding the bitcoin space, with the cryptocurrency trucking forward without looking back. Alongside this, the community has been feverishly discussing the block size, segregated witness (SegWit), fungibility and privacy.
At the time of writing, bitcoin is valued at $960 USD, and it is the cryptocurrency's highest price point in over three years. Moreover, adoption is growing fast as bitcoin becomes more popularized in regions like China, India, Venezuela, and Russia. As more and more people continue to use the cryptocurrency for solutions like remittances and escape from capital controls, bureaucrats globally are seeking to regulate digital currency use. This can be seen in many countries such as the U.S. with the country's tax agency the IRS looking to probe American bitcoin usage.
Many people have their different opinions on the state of bitcoin currently viewing the network from their subjective valuations.
Bitcoin.com decided to reach out to a wide range of well-known cryptocurrency community members and ask them one simple question:
‚ÄúHow would you summarize the current state of bitcoin as the year 2016 closes?‚Äù
What we got back was everything from a single line of observation to a whole ode on the fascinating developments. Here's what a few those Bitcoin proponents within the community had to say:
‚Ä¢ ‚Äú2016 was Bitcoin's Year of Distraction. Attention was instead directed at the undefined abstractions (‚ÄúBlockchain,‚Äù ‚Äúdistributed ledger,‚Äù ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù) which constitute Bitcoin's competition. This exploration and experimentation is normal for a new industry. However, in 2017 users will demand tangible, concrete results (actual cost reductions, actual sales). As the competition fails to deliver, the attention owed to BTC will be repaid‚Ä¶with interest.‚Äù ‚Äî Paul Sztorc, Hivemind developer
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúSo this year basically I think was a ‚ÄòState of Unstable Coins.' We had the core and classic teams battling it out, new proponents entering the ring like Rootstock. And there was so much buzz about this thing called blockchain that it kind of blinded everyone for a short bit towards the early and middle of the year with all these institutional players taking an interest in the technology, but as we got towards the later half of the year and the bitcoin price climbed to $700, the focus came back to bitcoin ‚Äî not as much the blockchain. It's like there is a fork in the industry to figure out where this is all going while there is such uncertainty about the big players in the industry.‚Äù‚Äî Lisa Cheng, Vanbex Group
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúI've been excited about bitcoin for nearly six years now, but there are more reasons to be excited about it now than ever before.‚Äù ‚Äî Roger Ver, Bitcoin's first Investor, owner of Bitcoin.com
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúI saw a nice quote this morning from Quartz. ‚ÄúBitcoin doesn't care what Silicon Valley thinks.‚Äù Bitcoin doesn't care what anyone thinks. I remember a conversation with Mike Hearn in 2013 where we were discussing bitcoin, and I asked them about where they thought the price was going. They said, ‚ÄúBitcoin does what it does‚Äù. This technology has seen a dramatic increase in visibility and experienced both the good and bad sides of the limelight: rising interest among corporations and investors, alongside more regulatory scrutiny, and uncertainty. There is much in-fighting and disagreement among developers which amplifies this uncertainty. It's at this time, more than ever before, that the global community is needed to ensure a prosperous and well-balanced future for the technology.‚Äù ‚Äî Moe Levin, Founder of The North American Bitcoin Conference
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúIn my opinion, the state of bitcoin is tumultuous but hopeful.‚Äù ‚Äî Dmitry ‚ÄúRassah‚Äù Murashchik, Mycelium
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúBitcoin in 2016 is like a teenager sending off college applications or one of the last gunslingers of the Old West: the technology has emerged and is starting to move forward and stand on its own, but it is still a new and immature space with lots of risk and pitfalls. Overall, as this technology matures and marches toward adulthood we will see more opportunities for impact and more evidence of its amazing potential.‚Äù ‚Äî Bruce Fenton, Atlantic Financial
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúI'm thrilled to see the end of this calamitous year, but through it all the one shining light has been the undeniable, unstoppable march of bitcoin. With the healthy consolidation within the industry, the rollout of SegWit and Lightning Network, the rise in price, the all-time-high global interest in bitcoin seen on Localbitcoins, and the dawning realization by many that an open, public blockchain is superior to private imitations ‚Äî I feel very positive that bitcoin is going to continue to chug along quite nicely in 2017 and beyond.‚Äù‚Äî Brooke Royse-Maller, Bitcoin Mom
‚Ä¢ ‚Äú2016 was the year of true colors. Most of the bad actors have dropped off, and those that remain are revealing that they're out of their weight class. The good actors, by which I mean, devs, companies, miners, and users who want bitcoin to succeed in the long term, continue to soldier on. I am especially in awe of the devs, who under vile political conditions, and without pay, are still able to produce sound code. What most people don't realize is that bitcoin has problems beyond block size, and I look forward to seeing if segwit can begin to resolve them.‚Äù ‚Äî Julia Tourianski, Brave The World
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúVenezuela and India have proven why an alternative to a nation's currency must exist. When governments abuse their monetary power, bitcoin provides a vent to the suppressed. Being able to transfer wealth with no intermediaries is what bitcoin is all about. Understanding this simple fact is challenging, but I think reporters are beginning to grasp it. Actually, bitcoin will save the entire news industry as micropayments will fill the holes of declining ad revenues.‚Äù ‚Äî Datavetaren, Software Engineer & Computer Scientist
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhat a fun year! We kicked it off with wild announcements from R3, Ethereum, Onecoin, and Dash that their visions are the certain future‚Äîand, as usual, that Bitcoin itself was old news. By the year's end, the numbers were in‚Äîand Bitcoin was still on top (way, way on top). So, as the scammers pivot to DLT's and ICO's as the new cure for whatever ails you, the honey badger just treks onward. While buzzwords and faces change with the season, for Bitcoin's veterans, surprises are few and far between.‚Äù ‚Äî Chris DeRose, software developer, Bitcoin Uncensored host.
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúBitcoin's cold winter on tales of Mike Hearn
Emboldened the bankchains, made hodlers churn;
As scaling unfolded, emotions did run, and so
Did investors to Ethereum.
Spring's ether rally became summer's crash
As the magical DAO hack made off with the cash,
Hacked too was Bitfinex, but they made a coin
To create out of air a virtually settled purloin.
ICOs thundered down from the heavens at will.
Iconomi, First Blood, they all had their fill.
Waves begat Incent, Golem sold quick.
Steem rose, Waves rolled in, ZCash was slick.
Then quietly the halving, and large miners fled
As more academics pronounced bitcoin dead.
But honey badger don't care and November arrived,
So we're approaching the moon launch from $975‚Ä¶‚Äú
‚Äî Michael Terpin, co-founder and chairperson of BitAngels
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúBitcoin is the most valuable open-source project ever created. A new global monetary system, always on, with developers providing continuous improvement and repairs while it is still running. Many have compared it with attempting to repair an airplane while in flight. To have the debate in private would have been pointless. We have to discuss and repair Bitcoin in the public because it is the public that uses Bitcoin. Did we develop a few black eyes because of the debate?

UC President Janet Napolitano has been appointed to the faculty of UC Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy, Dean Henry Brady announced today (Thursday, Dec. 18).
Chancellor Nicholas Dirks approved the appointment of Napolitano to the tenured position, following the standard faculty and administrative review process. The position will provide no compensation while they are serving as UC president.
Presidents of the 10-campus UC system typically receive a faculty appointment.
‚ÄúOne of the hallmarks of top-ranked public-policy schools is that they not only have world-class academic scholars who develop the scientific basis for new public policies, but they also have faculty members who have made major impacts on public policy through their innovative work,‚Äù Brady said. ‚ÄúThese leaders have formulated new policy ideas, developed new public-sector organizations and implemented programs to advance these policies.‚Äù
Brady noted that Napolitano ‚Äúhas done all of these things successfully in high-profile, demanding positions.‚Äù
Napolitano has a lengthy record in public service. They served as U.S. attorney in Arizona before being elected Arizona's first female attorney general, and they were the twice-elected governor of Arizona when they joined President Barack Obama's Cabinet as the third secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. They began serving as the 20th president of the UC system on Sept. 30, 2013.
As the first woman to chair the National Governors Association, Napolitano launched the ‚ÄúInnovation America‚Äù initiative to align K-12 and higher-education curricula. At the Department of Homeland Security, they strengthened outreach efforts to academic institutions through the establishment of the Office of Academic Engagement, and they created the Homeland Security Academic Advisory Council, involving leadership from more than 20 universities and colleges around the country.
‚ÄúI am honored and privileged to become a faculty member of UC Berkeley's Goldman School, and I hope to participate in the future in educating the next generation of public-service leaders,‚Äù Napolitano said.

A few weeks ago, we reported that Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Looper) was circling the title role in Warner Bros.' Sandman, an adaptation of the Neil Gaiman comic pitched to the studio by screenwriter-producer David S. Goyer. A new development has JGL in the final stages of a deal that sets them up as a producer of the film with an attachment to star, but the real twist is that they might be lining up to take the director's chair as well. The search is on for a writer at the moment. Hit the jump for more.
Deadline reports that Gordon-Levitt may direct and star in Sandman in addition to their role as a producer alongside Goyer. Here's what Gordon-Levitt had to say about it via Twitter:
Gordon-Levitt made their directorial debut with Don Jon, which was certainly a crowd-pleaser, but a Sandman adaptation brings with it the expectations of the property's fanbase. Originally running from 1989 to 1996, Gaiman's take on the comic series revived a mid-70s creation of Jack Kirby and Joe Simon. Gaiman's reimagining of the character went on to become one of the few graphic novels to grace the New York Times Bestseller list.
Their story centers on the title character (who is known by many names, including Dream and Morpheus), an anthropomorphic manifestation of dreams. Held prisoner for 70s years, they escape into the modern world to seek vengeance on their captors and set about rebuilding their crumbling kingdom. Much as the character themselves changes from a cruel being to more of a tragic hero, the story itself evolves from a dark horror comic to an elaborate fantasy story. A Sandman adaptation has been tried a number of times over the years, so here's hoping that Goyer and Gordon-Levitt can take it further down the road to development.

Elon Musk, South African engineer and entrepreneur, is no stranger to innovation; they co-founded iconic tech firm PayPal. More recent projects include SpaceX, one of the handful of attempts to bring the private sector into outer space, as well as Tesla Motors, the company that brought us the first fully electric sports car. Now, Tesla Motors is creating buzz on the Internet with its Model X. Due in 2013, the Model X is a small, fully electric sport utility vehicle. Just to reserve the car costs $5,000, while the final cost will be somewhere between $60,000 and $100,000.
While PayPal was a rousing success, eventually acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion and now headquartered in eBay's San Jose satellite office campus. The same wild success cannot be said of Tesla Motors. Not even moderately. Despite having all the right components -- an innovative and stylish product that anticipates the future with no small amount of buzz -- Tesla has hemorrhaged money. In 2011 alone it lost over $250 million, losing around $150 million in 2010. Still, the Model X might be just what the doctor ordered for this innovative company named after Nikola Tesla, the patron saint of future science and strange innovation.
Tesla Motors is different than other car companies. Perhaps most obviously, they only make fully electric cars; no hybrids. Rather than coming out of Detroit, Tesla operates out of Silicon Valley, the center of innovation in the United States. But most importantly, the cars are designed for driver experience and performance. Compare this to most hybrids coming out of Detroit and Japan where making a car seems like an afterthought to having a hybrid in the brand.
Still, Tesla's commitment to quality comes with a high price tag. The first vehicle produced by Tesla, the Roadster, cost over $100,000. Its sedan (the Model S) retails at about half that price, but is still more costly than the average roadster. While this might account for the massive money loss at the corporate level, it's all part of the master plan for Tesla Motors. The company has plans to debut a more modestly priced vehicle, codenamed BlueStar. The BlueStar would retail at between $20,000 and $30,000. In the meantime, the company is content to focus its energies on early adopters and trendsetters in Silicon Valley. This allows the company to perfect its technology without worrying about price point and to cultivate a brand identity. However, it hasn't been too helpful for Tesla's bottom line.
The company hopes the Model X will turn this around. Not only is it already the best-selling product in the history of Tesla Motors by ‚Äúa wide margin,‚Äù according to CEO Elon Musk, it's also spurred interest in the company's other vehicles. The Model X might just be what puts Tesla Motors into the black.
The name of the company itself carries immense amounts of cache. As mentioned above, Nikola Tesla is a sort of standard bearer for 'lunatic fringe' type innovations. Their inventions included crude radar devices and the groundwork for wireless communication. Tesla spent much of the end of their life working on more speculative designs for directed energy weapons (commonly known as 'death rays,' and currently being rolled out in both southwest Asia, central Asia and the United States for crowd control) and ion-propelled aircraft that would operate without wings, rudders or an on-board fuel source.
It's impossible to know with any certainty what Tesla would have thought about the vehicles that bear their name. Still, it seems safe to say that luxury automobiles for a small social and technological elite aren't exactly what the man who wanted to bring free electricity to the world had in mind.
Still, if Tesla Motors can get the public interested in fully electric cars, it will be a fitting heir to their legacy. If Tesla stood for one thing it was the idea that paradigm shifts aren't only possible, they're necessary for the continued existence of the human species. In an era where global climate instability is an increasing concern, the need to dramatically reduce humankind's carbon footprint couldn't be clearer.
Another thing I like about Perl data structures, is that once I have stuffed all my data in there, I can easily see what it looks like with Data::Dumper .
my $data = { list1 => [ { x => 'y' }, { a => 'b' }, # etc ... ], # etc ... } print Dumper($data);
And the result is:
$VAR1 = { 'list1' => [ { 'x' => 'y' }, { 'a' => 'b' } ] };
This is a big help with Exploratory Programming as you can see if you're stuffing values in the right place.
You might be surprised to learn that I want the same functionality in Emacs Lisp.
(defun hash-dumper (hash &optional indent) (when (null indent) (setq indent 0)) (let (lines indent-string) (setq indent-string "" ) (dotimes (i indent) (setq indent-string (concat " " indent-string))) (maphash (lambda (k v) ( if (hash-table -p v) ( push ( format " %s =>
%s " k (hash-dumper v (+ indent 2))) lines) ( push ( format " %s => %s " k v) lines))) hash) (concat ( format " %s {" indent-string) (mapconcat # 'identity lines (format "
%s " indent-string)) "}" )))
And the result‚Ä¶
( defvar %hash ) (setq %hash (_h { 1 2 'h (_h { 3 4 5 6 'h2 (_h { 1 2 3 [5 6 7] 'vh (vector (_h { 1 2 }) (_h { 3 4 })) }) }) })) ;; (insert (format "
%s" (hash-dumper %hash))) {h => {h2 => {vh => [#<hash-table 'eql nil 1/65 0x17cce80> #<hash-table 'eql nil 1/65 0x16f0a00>] 3 => [5 6 7] 1 => 2} 5 => 6 3 => 4} 1 => 2}
Not bad, but not quite right. Fixing the problem with lists of hashes is left as an exercise for the reader.
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) ‚Äî After conducting a probe that included a face-to-face interview with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, the state's ethics commission is throwing out complaints related to Bondi's decision to seek a $25,000 campaign contribution from Donald Trump nearly four years ago.
Bondi asked for ‚Äî and got ‚Äî money from Trump's charitable foundation about the same time their office was being asked about a New York investigation of alleged fraud at Trump University. They also received a $500 contribution from their daughter Ivanka Trump the same month.
During a closed-door meeting Friday, the Florida Commission on Ethics concluded there was no probable cause that Bondi violated any state laws, according to Mark Herron, a Tallahassee attorney who represented one of the people who filed a complaint against them
The commission endorsed the recommendations of an outside lawyer who reviewed the case after an investigator looked into four separate complaints. Those complaints raised questions about the contributions to Bondi, as well as their decision to endorse Trump right before Florida's Republican primary, and their appointment to Trump's transition team after they won the presidential election.
‚ÄúAdmittedly it may raise suspicions within a month after the New York attorney general announced that New York would be filing a lawsuit against Trump University, Donald Trump contributed $25,000 to the respondent or their organizations,‚Äù attorney George Reeves wrote to the commission. ‚ÄúHowever, in this case there is no evidence that the respondent was involved with the investigation or decisions regarding Trump University.‚Äù
As part of the investigation, Bondi was personally interviewed along with their attorney. The investigator also questioned the official who handled complaints concerning Trump University and they said they never discussed them with Bondi.
‚ÄúI reviewed those complaints and they had nothing to do with them,‚Äù said Mark Hamilton, who now works for the Department of Revenue, an agency that reports to Gov. Rick Scott, Bondi and two other elected officials. ‚ÄúThe buck stops here.‚Äù
The investigator stated that ‚Äúefforts to reach President Trump or a member of their staff for an interview were unsuccessful.‚Äù
J. Whitfield Larrabee, a Massachusetts trial attorney who filed one of the complaints, criticized the ethics commission because they said they did not look at Bondi's decision to accept a contribution from a charity. Trump's 2013 check, drawn on an account in the name of the Donald J. Trump Foundation, violated a federal prohibition against charities giving money to political groups. The issue garnered national media coverage last year during Trump's presidential campaign, and their foundation paid a $2,500 fine to the IRS.
‚ÄúI am disappointed that the Attorney General has engaged in a clear violation of the law without any consequence,‚Äù Larrabee said in an email.
Though both Trump University and the Florida-based Trump Institute had stopped offering classes by the time Bondi took office in 2011, more than 20 complaints had been filed by former students who claimed they were swindled.
A judge earlier this month approved an agreement for the president to pay $25 million to settle lawsuits over Trump University, ending nearly seven years of legal battles with customers who claimed they were misled by failed promises to teach success in real estate.
The Associated Press reported last June that Bondi personally asked Trump for help for their 2014 re-election. They have said they turned to them because they were on a list of ‚Äúfriends and family‚Äù they sought money from when they first ramped up fundraising efforts.
Trump signed a check on Sept. 9, 2013, and it was received by Bondi's political committee on Sept. 17 of that year.
But by that time, emails show top officials in their office, including their chief of staff, were aware that reporters in Florida were asking about a lawsuit against Trump University by the New York attorney general.
Bondi's office said at the time that it was ‚Äúreviewing‚Äù the lawsuit, but it never took any other action. Bondi said their office receives tens of thousands of such complaints each year. Bondi said they were unaware that their office had been asked about the New York lawsuit until a Florida columnist highlighted the case and the donation from Trump.

Back in 2008, Rick Santorum traveled to Ave Maria University in Florida to deliver an address to students attending the Catholic university founded by Domino's Pizza founder Tom Monaghan which they moved from Michigan as part of their effort to build their own personal theocracy in Naples.
Santorum told the students at Ave Maria how lucky they were to be living in a time when God's Army is more needed than ever because all of the major institutions in society were under attack by Satan.
The audio of Santorum's remarks is still posted on the Ave Maria website and the bulk of their speech was dedicated to explaining how God had used him, their political career, and even the death of their son Gabriel in the fight to outlaw abortion in America.
But Santorum began their remarks by explaining to the students in attendance how every institution in America has been destroyed by Satan; from academia to politics with even the church having fallen under Their sway ‚Äì not the Catholic church, of course, but ‚Äúmainline Protestantism‚Äù which is in such ‚Äúshambles‚Äù that it is not even Christian any longer:
This is not a political war at all. This is not a cultural war. This is a spiritual war. And the Father of Lies has their sights on what you would think the Father of Lies would have their sights on: a good, decent, powerful, influential country ‚Äì the United States of America. If you were Satan, who would you attack in this day and age. There is no one else to go after other than the United States and that has been the case now for almost two hundred years, once America's preeminence was sown by our great Founding Fathers.
They didn't have much success in the early days. Our foundation was very strong, in fact, is very strong. But over time, that great, acidic quality of time corrodes even the strongest foundations. And Satan has done so by attacking the great institutions of America, using those great vices of pride, vanity, and sensuality as the root to attack all of the strong plants that has so deeply rooted in the American tradition.
They were successful. They attack all of us and they attack all of our institutions. The place where they are, in my mind, the most successful and first successful was in academia. They understood pride of smart people. They attacked them at their weakest, that they were, in fact, smarter than everybody else and could come up with something new and different. Pursue new truths, deny the existence of truth, play with it because they're smart. And so academia, a long time ago, fell.
And you say ‚Äúwhat could be the impact of academia falling?‚Äù Well, I would have the argument that the other structures that I'm going to talk about here had root of their destruction because of academia. Because what academia does is educate the elites in our society, educates the leaders in our society, particularly at the college level. And they were the first to fall.
And so what we saw this domino effect, once the colleges fell and those who were being education in our institutions, the next was the church. Now you'd say, ‚Äòwait, the Catholic Church'? No. We all know that this country was founded on a Judeo-Christian ethic but the Judeo-Christian ethic was a Protestant Judeo-Christian ethic, sure the Catholics had some influence, but this was a Protestant country and the Protestant ethic, mainstream, mainline Protestantism, and of course we look at the shape of mainline Protestantism in this country and it is in shambles, it is gone from the world of Christianity as I see it. So they attacked mainline Protestantism, they attacked the Church, and what better way to go after smart people who also believe they're pious to use both vanity and pride to also go after the Church.
After that, you start destroying the Church and you start destroying academia, the culture is where their next success was and I need not even go into the state of the popular culture today. Whether its sensuality of vanity of the famous in America, they are peacocks on display and they have taken their poor behavior and made it fashionable. The corruption of culture, the corruption of manners, the corruption of decency is now on display whether it's the NBA or whether it's a rock concert or whether it's on a movie set.
The fourth, and this was harder, now I know you're going to challenge me on this one, but politics and government was the next to fall. You say, ‚Äòyou would think they would be the first to fall, as fallible as we are in politics,' but people in political life get elected by ordinary folks from lots of places all over the country where the foundations of this country are still strong. So while we may certainly have had examples, the body politic held up fairly well up until the last couple of decades, but it is falling too.
WASHINGTON -- Tom Foley, the Republican candidate for governor in Connecticut, has spent much of their campaign criticizing the state's sweeping gun control package passed last year after the Sandy Hook elementary school mass shooting. But when pressed Thursday on what changes they would make to the state's gun laws, Foley refused to say.
The subject of gun control resurfaced during Connecticut's fifth gubernatorial debate, with Foley facing incumbent Gov. Dan Malloy (D) and conservative Joe Visconti, who is petitioning to run as an independent. Visconti, in their first debate of the election, spoke in favor of repealing most of the gun control package signed into law by Malloy in April.
The stricter gun laws, drafted on a bipartisan basis by Connecticut's legislature, require mandatory background checks for private gun sales, ban magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds, and expand the list of guns covered by the state's assault weapons ban. It also created a $15 million fund to help schools improve security.
When Foley was asked for their take on the gun reforms, they criticized the law, signed by Malloy, but offered no alternative.
"I'm a problem-solver, and when the tragedy in Newtown happened, obviously a government response was appropriate," Foley said. "But I think you need to focus on the source of the problem. ... My complaint is the gun bill Gov. Malloy passed hasn't made Connecticut any safer."
Foley said the root of the Newtown massacre was a mental health issue, not a gun issue.
Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza, who had severe mental health issues, used 30-round magazines to kill 20 children and six educators in less than five minutes before taking their own life in December 2012. The firearms Lanza used were registered to their mother, Nancy Lanza, who had purchased them legally. Lanza shot their mother to death in their home before the school rampage.
Malloy accused Foley of disguising their position, pointing out that in the past Foley has said they would repeal the gun bill.
"That's whispering to people, that's whispering to the legislature, 'Come back and repeal the bill and I'll sign it,'" Malloy said.
Malloy cited statistics showing a drop in violent crime across Connecticut, which state leaders said resulted from police task forces, community policing programs and investments in reducing gun violence. A memo released by Malloy's office earlier this year said annual murders had dropped below 100 for the first time in a decade.
In response, Foley was asked once more to identify aspects of the gun law that they either would remove or change. Again, they ducked the question.
"We have a Democratic legislature and the legislature passes the laws, not the governor," Foley said. "It seems very unlikely to me that this legislature is going to revise that bill in any significant way, and I think the opportunity to balance the interests that were at stake here was when this bill came before the legislature. And the governor was instrumental in helping design and pass this bill and they took away a lot of law-abiding citizens' rights, and they're upset. ‚Ä¶ They just went willy-nilly in the direction they wanted to go. When I'm governor, I'm going to balance everyone's rights."
A final attempt by the moderator to get specifics from Foley was rebuffed.
"Listen, the legislature passes the law. I don't think the legislature is going to pick that up as an issue," Foley said.
Foley has sought to avoid the subject of gun control before, but showed a more aggressive tone in the fourth televised debate last week. During that exchange, Foley referenced their older sister's mental health problems to highlight their own personal experience with insufficient resources for mental health. They accused Malloy of "grandstanding" on the issue and said it was "insulting" for the governor to hold guns, not mental health, responsible for the shooting in Newtown.
HuffPost's Pollster average, which combines all publicly available polling, shows Malloy and Foley locked in a dead heat.

The media's hatred for president Trump knows no bounds. As I tweeted earlier today:
Here's how NBC plugged its big scoop:
President Trump is at their West Palm Beach golf club, marking the 82nd day at one of their golf properties and 106th day at a Trump property since taking office https://t.co/den2jWBtto pic.twitter.com/gm3L9F2WGA
From the story:
More than four months into their term, Trump has visited more golf courses at a faster clip than their three most recent predecessors, according to The New York Times. Politifact reports that at this point in their presidency, Obama had gone golfing 11 time, while Trump has golfed at least 21 times.
The precise number of times Trump has played golf isn't known, however. Their administration has tried to hide Trump's activity, keeping their traveling press pool away and often refusing to confirm whether they have played golf. Instead, social media has become a source of crowd-sourced reporting into the president's whereabouts.
This tracker automatically counts Trump's days in office. When Trump arrives at one of their properties, the tracker updates accordingly.
Unfortunately for Larsen, who took care to send the packages to constituency offices to bypass mailroom security at Parliament Hill, they still might not end up with their intended recipients.
"They're going to be legalizing it soon and I think if we're going to be looking forward to how we will legalize it, it's good to look back and see how it was made illegal and the important role this plant has played in Canadian history and Canadian culture," they said about the book.
Dana Larsen, a founding member of Canada's Marijuana Party who has also run federally for the New Democratic Party, told Radio-Canada they mailed out packages, consisting of a gram of pot and a copy of their book Cannabis in Canada, to journalists across the country and to every Liberal MP.
As a reminder of their election promise to legalize marijuana, Canadian Liberal MPs were each given the gift of weed over the holidays by a prominent activist looking to "re-familiarize" them with its "pleasant effects." But, the pot-friendly party is taking a decidedly unfriendly stance towards the offering.

In an email to MPs, the Liberal Whip's office instructed those who received Larsen's gifts to contact their local police service and Parliamentary Protective Services to discuss how to move forward.
"It is not recommended that you dispose of the material yourself, or return it to its sender," said the email.
A spokesperson from the office of Aurora-Oak Ridges-Richmond Hill MP Leona Alleslev said they hadn't received such a package, but that "all MPs have been instructed to contact local law enforcement immediately to properly dispose" of them.
One of many MPs contacted by VICE News, William Amos's office also said they hadn't received one since their constituency offices aren't open yet.
It's unclear whether or not everyone has actually obeyed the Whip's instructions. Rookie MP for Beaches-East York Nate Erskine-Smith, for example, seemed to have ignored them.
"Thanks for the gift @DanaLarsen!" they tweeted. "Received, but haven't smoked it (yet). #LegalizeIt"
Thanks for the gift ‚Äî Nate Erskine-Smith (@beynate)January 5, 2016
"On a serious note, thousands of Canadians are charged every year for marijuana possession," they continued. "A sensible policy is long overdue."
Vancouver Centre MP Hedy Fry found little humor in the stunt, however, telling the Vancouver Sun they were concerned the package could land in the hands of youth, and that mailing it violates regulations for transporting marijuana in Canada.
The email sent from the Liberal Whip to MPs reaffirmed the party's position on legalizing the drug.
"The Ministers of Justice, Public Safety, and Health are establishing a federal/provincial/territorial task force to advise on the design of a new system of strict marijuana sales and distribution, with input from experts in public health, substance abuse, and law enforcement," it said.
A concrete timeline hasn't been set, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's already complicated plan to legalize, regulate and restrict access to marijuana could be further disrupted by three international treaties that criminalize the production and possession of the drug.
Canada is a signatory of The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, as amended by the 1972 Protocol; The Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 and The United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988.
Trudeau has been warned of the potential obstacles, according to a briefing note obtained by the Canadian Press.
"All three require the criminalization of possession and production of cannabis," says the note.
"As part of examining legalization of cannabis possession and production, Canada will need to explore how to inform the international community and will have to take the steps needed to adjust its obligations under these conventions."

Everyone from medical professionals to strangers tell pregnant people what they should and shouldn't be doing with their bodies. Throughout my two pregnancies, OB-GYNs, nurses, family, and friends often used phrases like ‚Äúyou can't,‚Äù ‚Äúyou're not allowed to,‚Äù and ‚Äúwe'll let you‚Äù when discussing my body.
Unfortunately, this is standard practice in U.S. medicine, which supports a disease-based, doctor-centered, patriarchal model of care (as opposed to patient-based care, which emphasizes collaboration, understanding, and choices). Policies and protocols are set up to avoid liability.
While in labor with my first child in 2015, I was told I couldn't move around or go to the bathroom on my own, switch positions without assistance, or eat anything besides ice chips.
Not being able to go to the bathroom on my own was annoying; not being able to switch positions or move the way my body wanted to increase my pain. Enduring labor without eating or drinking was exhausting and directly affected my resolve to keep going without an epidural.
Pregnant people have a lot of experience being told what to do with their bodies.
It's also just dumb. Not long after I gave birth, new research showed that food during labor was not harmful and could actually be beneficial. Sometimes new research affects medical policies, sometimes it slowly trickles down, and sometimes it doesn't change anything.
At my second child's birth, a nurse repeatedly told me not to scream, which I did naturally to cope with the pain. Between the contractions and labored breathing, it took me a while to protest. And when I finally did speak up, it wasn't particularly assertive‚Äî‚ÄúIt's all right, I can scream‚Äù‚Äîbut it did get the nurse to stop.
When that kind of misogynistic, restrictive language is directed at you for nine months, it's easy to forget that people (including the medical professionals you hired) may be giving you advice about your body‚Äîbut that you're the one who gets to make the decisions.
Pregnant people have a lot of experience being told what to do with their bodies. By the time they've made it to their first prenatal appointment, they've been told one or more or all of the following about their bodies in their lifetimes: They should dress it in pink; shave their legs and arm pits; keep it smooth and cellulite-free; and cover a certain amount of it most of the time and some parts of it all the time lest it send the ‚Äúwrong message.‚Äù
People who become used to their bodies being policed may not have a sense of body ownership and agency. There are a wide variety of abuses that occur during childbirth because people either don't know or don't feel like they have options. They are coerced, given unnecessary interventions, threatened. They are denied lack of informed consent, which requires the provider to give the patient a comprehensive overview of possible risks and benefits of a treatment.
‚ÄúThe most pervasive language I find when dealing with pregnant people in the medical setting is coercive,‚Äù said my doula, Erin Carter, when I asked them about the language she's encountered in medical settings. ‚Äú[It's] either meant to convince a parent that they don't know what they know, or elicit their consent by questioning the safety of the baby (whether or not there is a safety concern at play).‚Äù
‚ÄúIn more progressive places, women have more freedom.‚Äù
They continued. ‚ÄúI have literally heard the phrase, ‚ÄòWell you don't want a dead baby, do you?' come out of a nurse's mouth. ‚Ä¶ It's ironic that I have seen this coercive language used most frequently in early labor with what would be typically considered minor medical interventions. And when clients have encountered true medical emergencies, the language used with them has more frequently been compassionate and fact-based in nature,‚Äù Carter said.
According to Cristen Pascucci, founder of organization Birth Monopoly as well as a childbirth legal rights advocate, these practices are based on the idea that the person giving birth is under the authority of the medical provider or institution.
‚ÄúIn more progressive places, women have more freedom, but that freedom belongs to them only as far as their care providers or institution allows it,‚Äù they said.
These normalized practices of medical bullying are now starting to get some pushback: Recent U.S. court cases that addressed abuse and coercion during childbirth include one with a physician being charged with assault and battery (based on lack of informed consent) for performing an unwanted episiotomy on a patient who repeatedly said no to the procedure, a nearly unprecedented decision. In another case, a plaintiff was awarded $16 million after receiving unnecessary medical interventions that left them permanently injured from a hospital that had advertised itself as a natural birthing environment.
After feeling pressured into a C-section during my first birth, I had more of an idea of what I would and would not allow happening to my body during delivery. To address these decisions, I hired a midwife and doula in addition to an OB-GYN (in case I ended up at the nearest hospital, which didn't permit midwife care) to guide me through pregnancy and birth.
Black cisgender women deal with their sexuality and reproduction being politicized.
Supported by my doctor, midwife, and doula‚Äîall women‚ÄîI was kept up to date on what was going on in my body and my baby's, given treatment options, and ultimately felt cared for. In the delivery room, everyone worked together to ensure I had a safe and successful vaginal birth after cesarean. My daughter arrived after just four hours of labor, and I felt like my body belonged to me, something I did not feel at the end of my first birth.
Unfortunately, that's not a typical experience, especially for people of color, poor people, LGBTQ people, and disabled people, who often lack adequate access to health care that empowers them.
In the birth environment, Black women struggle for supported, healthy births. The maternal mortality rate for Black women is almost four times higher than for White women. Even when Black and White women share the same socioeconomic status, Black women are still more likely to die. Black patients are also more likely to suffer severe birth complications, be denied effective pain medication, and lack support for breastfeeding.
Black women have different language directed at them. Sherronda J. Brown, author of the essay ‚ÄúWhite Women in Robes,‚Äù explained that Black cisgender women deal with their sexuality and reproduction being politicized with stereotypes of ‚Äúmammies,‚Äù ‚Äújezebels,‚Äù ‚Äúsapphires,‚Äù and ‚Äúwelfare queens,‚Äù each of these working to construct Black women as inherently undesirable, emasculating, licentious, angry, and sexually irresponsible.
‚ÄúContinually battling against words like ‚Äògrown' and ‚Äòmannish' that are inscribed upon our bodies from the time that we are children. We are muled, by everyone,‚Äù Brown said.
The language we use directly reflects the way we treat each other. The differences between my two births were largely due to the team of caregivers I assembled, all of whom practiced some form of respectful maternity care. The language used during my second birth was also much more respectful, with far fewer occurrences of restrictive verbiage.
Each person is the only one who gets to make decisions about their body.

TOMS RIVER, NJ ‚Äî It may not have been the best time for a Toms River man to start channeling their inner Michael Jackson.
Especially in front of someone who apparently doesn't know what you're doing.
Toms River police were called to the Speedway gas station at 1833 Hooper Ave. about 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday by a station employee who reported a man lingering and acting erratically inside the store, police department spokesperson Ralph Stocco said.
Officer Walter Herman responded and found Mark Wixler, 39, of Kettle Creek Road, moonwalking their way through the aisles as they tried to choose merchandise, Stocco said.
While speaking to Wixler, an active arrest warrant from Neptune Township for $2,000 was discovered, and during a search after their arrest they were found to be in possession of six hypodermic syringes and a small amount of heroin, Stocco said.
Wixler was taken to the Ocean County Jail, Stocco said, but has since posted bail according to jail records.

France's highest administrative court will present its ruling Friday on a request to overturn a ban on the 'burkini', as controversy mounts surrounding the full-body swimsuit.
ADVERTISING Read more
The State Council's (Conseil d'Etat) ruling ‚Äì which is expected to set a precedent ‚Äì will be announced at approximately 3pm Paris time.
France's Human Rights League launched the appeal against the ban by the southern town of Villeneuve-Loubet, near Nice, which was one of the first of around 30 French towns to prohibit burkinis.
The debate on the controversial burkini was further fuelled ‚Äì and dominated international headlines ‚Äì after photographs emerged of armed police surrounding a veiled woman on a Nice beach, fining them and looking on as they removed their tunic.
Let's stop pretending France is the land of "libert√©" and "egalit√©" - when it allows something like this #WTFFrance pic.twitter.com/txSN4vw4In ‚Äî ‚òÅÔ∏è Elena Rossini ‚òÅÔ∏è (@_elena) August 24, 2016
'Religious proselytising'
As the scandal surrounding the photos of the police snowballed, the Nice mayor's office denied the veiled woman had been forced to remove them clothing. The mayor said the woman was simply showing the police the swimsuit they were wearing under their tunic, over a pair of leggings, when the picture was taken.
The police issued them with a fine and they then left the beach, the officials added.
Prime Minister Manuel Valls said they condemned any "stigmatisation" of Muslims, but maintained that the burkini was "a political sign of religious proselytising".
"We are not at war with Islam ... the French republic is welcoming (to Muslims), we are protecting them against discrimination," they told BFMTV.
>> Watch more on FRANCE24.com: ‚ÄúFrench Connections: Understanding the burkini ban‚Äù
But in a sign of the divisions within the Socialist government on the issue, Education Minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem said the "proliferation" of burkini bans "was not a welcome development".
'No link to terrorism'
Vallaud-Belkacem, who is of Moroccan origin, took issue with the wording of the ban in Nice which linked the measure to the jihadist attack in the resort town last month in which 86 people were killed.
"In my opinion, there is nothing to prove that there is a link between the terrorism of Daesh and what a woman wears on a beach," they said, using another term for the Islamic State group.
A look at the burkini ban controversy in France
But Valls stood firm, saying the bans were necessary to maintain "public order".
The administrative court in Nice ruled on Monday that the ban in Villeneuve-Loubet was "necessary, appropriate and proportionate" to prevent public disorder after the truck attack in Nice and the murder of a Catholic priest by two jihadists in northern France.
Burkini 'liable to offend'
The burkini was "liable to offend the religious convictions or (religious) non-convictions of other users of the beach", and could be seen as "a provocation", the court added.
The so-called burkini bans never actually mention the word burkini, although they are aimed at the garment, which covers the hair but leaves the face visible and goes all the way to the ankles.
The vague wording of the ban has caused confusion.
Apart from the incident featured in the photographs in Nice, a mother of two told AFP on Tuesday they had been fined on the beach in the resort of Cannes while wearing leggings, a tunic and a headscarf.
This is NOT French secularism. And unacceptable. The beach is NOT a public School. https://t.co/3YVa6DwHbn ‚Äî Caroline Fourest (@CarolineFourest) 24 August 2016
"I was sitting on a beach with my family. I was wearing a classic headscarf. I had no intention of swimming," said the 34-year-old who gave only their first name, Siam.
Anouar Kbibech, the head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM), said they were "concerned over the direction the public debate is taking".
Kbibech met Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve over the issue on Wednesday.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital, condemned the bans as they headed to Paris Thursday for talks with their French counterpart.
"I don't think anyone should tell women what they can and can't wear. Full stop. It's as simple as that," they told the London Evening Standard newspaper.
One of the world's most secular countries, France strongly separates religion and public life.
The burkini ban issue has raised serious questions in France about women's rights and secularism.
Islamic dress has long been a subject of debate in France, which was the first European country to ban the Islamic face veil in public in 2010, six years after outlawing the headscarf and other conspicuous religious symbols in state schools.

In the winter of 2013-14, an unusually strong and persistent ridge of atmospheric high pressure emerged in weather maps of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The feature, which was so unrelenting that meteorologists took to calling it the Ridiculously Resilient Ridge, weakened winds in the area enough that the normal wind-driven churning of the sea eased. Those winds usually promote upwelling, which brings deep, cool water up toward the surface; instead, the resilient ridge shut down the ocean circulation, leaving a large lens of unusually warm surface water in the northeastern Pacific.
At times, this patch of warm water seeped into the Bering Sea, the Gulf of Alaska, and the coastal waters off Washington, Oregon, and California. In fact, many parts of the northeastern Pacific experienced the greatest sea surface temperature anomalies in the historical record. Scientists and journalists took to calling the patch of warm water ‚Äúthe Blob.‚Äù Nicholas Bond, a University of Washington meteorologist and the Washington state's climatologist, coined the term in a June 2014 newsletter.
As unusually warm surface water sloshed around for months, the grim consequences began to ricochet through the marine food web. Microscopic phytoplankton thrive in cool waters, so the lack of upwelling water meant surface waters became increasingly starved of nutrients. With fewer phytoplankton, fish and other marine life began to suffer. Certain types of fish started avoiding the region altogether, and by 2015 record numbers of starving sea lions and fur seals were found stranded on California's beaches. Meanwhile, the warm water also began to produce some strange weather in the western United States.
Thanks in part to the strong El Ni√±o in the equatorial Pacific, the Blob has finally broken up. Beginning in November 2015, strong winds blowing south from Alaska began to pick up, and sea surface temperatures in the northeastern Pacific began to cool.
Data collected by the U.S. Navy's WindSAT instrument on the Coriolis satellite and the AMSR2 instrument on Japan's GCOM-W satellite bear this out. The maps above show sea surface temperature anomalies in the Pacific in July 2015 (top) and January 2016 (bottom). The maps do not depict absolute temperatures; instead, they show how much above (red) or below (blue) water temperatures were compared to the average from 2003 to 2012. The maps were built with data from the Microwave Optimally Interpolated SST product, a NASA-supported effort at Remote Sensing Systems.
In July 2015, temperatures were unusually warm across a large swath from the Gulf of Alaska to the California coast. By January 2016, more seasonable temperatures had returned. The development came as no surprise to weather watchers. In September 2015, Clifford Mass, a University of Washington atmospheric scientist, explained in their blog that El Ni√±o generally brings lower-than-normal sea surface pressures to the eastern Pacific‚Äîthe opposite of the systems that sustained the blob. By mid-December 2015, Mass declared that the blob was dead.
Remnants of the warm water patch still persist. ‚ÄúThere are significant temperature anomalies extending down to a depth of about 300 meters. So while the weather patterns the past few months have not been that favorable to warming, it will take a while for all of the accumulated heat to go away,‚Äù explained Bond. That means impacts on marine life and on weather in the Pacific Northwest could linger, though Bond does not think the blob will return in the near term.

MILWAUKEE ‚Äî EARLIER this month, Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin and potential Republican presidential candidate, unveiled a proposed budget that would cut $300 million of funds to the University of Wisconsin system and shift power over tuition from the Legislature to a new public authority controlled by appointed regents. The initial draft of Mr. Walker's budget bill also proposed to rewrite the university's 110-year-old mission statement, known as the Wisconsin Idea, deleting ‚Äúthe search for truth‚Äù and replacing it with language about meeting ‚Äúthe state's work-force needs.‚Äù
This attack, surely meant to impress possible donors to the governor's potential presidential campaign, squanders the inheritance of all Wisconsinites: an affordable, top-ranked university system that attracts students and scholars from around the world and is a major contributor to the state's economy. Criticism prompted the governor to restore the Wisconsin Idea's wording, but the budget cuts remained.
Mr. Walker's action implies that Wisconsinites no longer share their parents' and grandparents' values. They suggest that a university system with a mission to ‚Äúeducate people and improve the human condition‚Äù is no longer a priority here.  They are wrong.
I teach history, a discipline that is always in the cross hairs of cuts designed to make a public university education more ‚Äúpractical.‚Äù But my students have shown me that they find the study of the past very relevant to their lives.
Winter and spring 2015 brought average or just-below average precipitation to the Pacific Northwest of North America. However, much of that precipitation fell as rain, not snow, and diminished snowpack was soon evident on peaks throughout the Cascade and Olympic mountain ranges. One of those peaks, Mount Baker, stands as a visible reminder of climate change in the area.
Mount Baker is located in Washington state, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of the Canadian border and 135 kilometers (85 miles) northeast of Seattle. The stratovolcano is the highest peak in the North Cascades, rising 3,286 meters (10,780 feet) above sea level. Every year the mountain retains a patch of ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù snow and ice that persists through the summer. The size of that patch, however, is shrinking and seeming less permanent.
The change is apparent in these natural-color images acquired with the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8. They show the extent of snow and ice cover on Mount Baker in early July 2013 and 2015.
Cryospheric scientist Dorothy Hall and programmer Nicolo DiGirolamo, at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, used the Landsat images to calculate the snow cover extent. On July 3, 2013, about 123 square kilometers (47 square miles) blanketed the mountain; by July 9, 2015, the area had shrunk to 45 square kilometers (17 square miles). There were no cloud-free scenes in early July 2014.
However, it was not just the snow that was sparse in 2015. The glaciers on Mount Baker have also retreated‚Äîa change that has taken place over a period of decades.
‚ÄúLandsat provides us with an unparalleled record from which we can measure interannual changes in snow and ice,‚Äù Hall said. ‚ÄúWe can document details of the snow drought in the Pacific Northwest and even compute decade-scale trends, such as the extent of the glaciers on Mount Baker.‚Äù
Mount Baker's flanks support the largest contiguous network of glaciers in the North Cascades, and they have been extensively studied. In the close-up image below, the glacier extent in 1958‚Äîwhich at the time covered 51 square kilometers (20 square miles)‚Äîis outlined in yellow on top of the 2015 image. According to research published in 2012, glacier coverage has dropped to about 39 square kilometers.
The 2015 snow drought on Mt. Baker and other mountains in the Pacific Northwest has implications for wildlife, for fire risk, and for agriculture. Some reservoirs in the region were reported to be stable thanks to ample rainfall, but others that rely on snowmelt-fed streams are less abundant during the dry months.

PS4: Info on Future Reveals and First Party Studios Working on the Console Given by Sony Employee
Giuseppe Nelva February 25, 2014 7:59:15 AM EST
Sony Computer Entertainment has been keeping the lid on its work-in-progress PS4 projects and upcoming announcements, and we still don't know what many of the teams working for the house of PlayStation are currently working on. NeoGAF user and insider DemonNite, who is known to work for Sony even if their identity is a well-kept secret, provided more information and teasing about what's happening behind closed doors:
First of all, they mentioned that morale is high internally, and everyone has high hopes for the new generation:
I think the future looks great. Everyone is happy and all have high hopes about the new generation : D
Another NeoGAF user listed the announcements he'd like to see at E3 and at Tokyo Game Show:
Deep Down further push
Sony Santa Monica new IP
Guerilla new IP / some new IP from Japan
Naughty Dog Uncharted further reveal
Driveclub reintroduction
Sony Bend / Sony London some reveal
Some more details on The Order 1886
More details on some of the smaller games such as Rime/Shadow of the Beast.
The user also specified: ‚ÄúI'll be okay with 1 maybe 2 missing out but no less than 6 of those 8 options.‚Äù
DemonNite quoted the list above and answered:
I dont know the final lineup, but leading up to E3 and perhaps at E3, there is a good chance you'll be happy.
While the answer was teasing and somewhat cryptic, it was also quite promising. After that, they moved on to give further info on just how many studios are working on the console:
That's a tough one to answer by me. There are MANY teams from the development side alone. Most (all?) studios will have at least another team doing something right now away from the main team. Larger studios will have more than that. One studio for example has 5+ teams on PS4 : )
They then specified that he's talking only about the western arms of the company:
I wasn't talking about Japan (not to say they also don't have a few teams internally on the development side). As I said‚Ä¶ many are on PS4 right now so putting a number on it is difficult at best : )
Looks like PS4 owners are in for a few surprises down the line. Counting that one studio has a whole five teams on PS4 (possibly Sony Santa Monica, considering its size and relevance, but this is just my personal speculation), and that there are many most of which have at least two teams at work, it's not hard to imagine that a whole lot of games are in development at Sony Worldwide Studios. That's an exciting perspective, to say the least.

Many a Sunday morning has involved millions of people all over the world wishing they hadn't had quite so much.
Their heads throb like a teenage boy's Adam's Apple on seeing Selena Gomez. Their throats are drier than a sand-technology textbook.
Yet too much beer has always, always meant one big hangover.
Now, however, sensitive Australian scientists claim they might take away at least some of the pain. They say they've created rehydrating beer.
News-Medical reports that nutrition experts at the Griffith Health Institute insist they've taken out many of the pesky dehydrative properties of beer (which cause the hangover) and still made it taste, well, like beer.
The idea was quite simple: make it more like Gatorade. In essence, the scientists added electrolytes to the beer, in order to keep mind and body afloat.
The experiment consisted of making people who'd just finished exercising (and therefore sweating) drink one of four beers. There were two full-strength brews and two of the lighter variety, one of each with electrolytes added.
Participants were asked to drink 150 percent of the amount of lost body mass due to exercise. They had to complete their drinking session in one hour.
You might imagine that beer-drinking after exercise might not be the most healthy thing to do.
On the one hand, you might never have met an English Premier League soccer player.
On the other, Associate Professor Ben Desbrow told News-Medical that many manual workers (techies, for example) do just that. They lift, run around or type and then sweat. Then they go to the pub.
Perhaps it's not surprising that the best performer with respect to hydration was the electro-light beer.
The researchers declared it one-third more effective with respect to hydration than a normal beer.
The trade-off, of course, was that the light beer had less alcohol. In each case, though, the scientists claim that no one noticed any difference in taste with any of the beers.
Many vodka drinkers have claimed over the years that they can become decidedly tipsy and then wake up entirely refreshed.
Some beer drinkers choose, after a heavy night solving the world's major issues, to drink several large glasses of water before going to bed.
This might mitigate against a hangover, though it might also cause some waking in the night to go to the bathroom.
I wonder, though, should electro-light beer become commercially available, whether people would readily select it.
Some hardened beer drinkers believe the morning-after pain is part of the experience.
Light beer is a soft (and, some feel, relatively tasteless) option already. Would an electro-light beer seem like little more -- or even less -- than an alcopop?
According to a new report from research firm IHS, Apple's iPhone 5 display lags behind the Samsung Galaxy S III's on the important measure of color gamut, which creates a more vibrant, crisp image with better overall color saturation, but the difference in terms of how users perceive the margin could actually be negligible, and is unlikely to alter buying decisions.
In fact, IHS says that the iPhone 5's screen may actually look better (more accurate and realistic) compared to the SGSIII, owing to ‚Äúbetter calibration, higher brightness and superior power efficiency.‚Äù Samsung's smartphone, by contrast, could appear ‚Äúoversaturated and unrealistic,‚Äù Vinita Jakhanwal, director for Small & Medium Displays at IHS, noted in a press release.
Apple's display also has advantages in terms of overall device thickness thanks to the use of in-cell touch panel technology, which incorporates the LCD and touch sensors into one, single layer. But the SGSIII actually beats the latest iPhone in terms of display thickness, and IHS says the iPhone 5 is slimmer overall due to other factors like battery thickness.
The pixel density on Samsung's screen is also smaller, with 306ppi compared to 326ppi on the iPhone 5. But Samsung's display provides true HD resolution at 720 x 1280, compared to 640 x 1136 for the iPhone 5. Apple has also faced criticism from some for using LCD instead of OLED technology in its smartphone, but Jakhanwal notes in the IHS report that OLED presents its own downsides, including concerns about how organic materials used in their construction ages, and what that will do to OLED lifetime and power efficiency in the longer term.
In the end, consumers care about performance in-hand, and both of these devices do well on that scale. Still, it's interesting to take a closer look at the design decisions these two smartphone titans make, and what effects those choices have on overall display performance in their mobile devices.
SACRAMENTO ‚Äî California faces the risk not just of devastating earthquakes but also of a catastrophic storm that could tear at the coasts, inundate the Central Valley and cause four to five times as much economic damage as a large quake, scientists and emergency planners warn.
The potential for such a storm was described at a conference of federal and California officials that ended Friday. Combining advanced flood mapping and atmospheric projections with data on California's geologic flood history, over 100 scientists calculated the probable consequences of a ‚Äúsuperstorm‚Äù carrying tropical moisture from the South Pacific and dropping up to 10 feet of rain across the state.
‚ÄúFloods are as much a part of our lives in California as earthquakes are,‚Äù said Lucy Jones, the chief scientist for the United States Geological Survey's multi-hazards initiative, adding, ‚ÄúWe are probably not going to be able to handle the biggest ones.‚Äù
The geological survey estimates that such a storm could cause up to $300 billion in damage. The scientists' models estimate that almost one-fourth of the houses in California could experience some flood damage from one.

The conference was convened by the geological survey, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the California Emergency Management Agency to help disaster-response planners draft new strategies to limit the storms' impact.
One of President Trump's former campaign advisers has pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents who are investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, the Department of Justice said Monday.
George Papadopoulos, the 30-year-old foreign policy adviser, was arrested in July and pleaded guilty earlier this month, according to court filings unsealed on Monday. The Justice Department unsealed the documents shortly after it announced charges against two other higher-ranking Trump campaign officials - Paul Manafort and Rick Gates.
The charges stem from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
Prosecutors charged Papadopoulos with lying to investigators about their conversations with a foreign professor who told them that Russians had thousands of emails containing "dirt" on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
They allegedly lied about their contact with a Russian woman whom the Justice Department says they worked with "in an effort to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials." Papadopoulos initially identified the woman as Russian President Vladimir Putin's niece, but later found out they were not related to Putin.
Papadopoulos allegedly told the FBI that those conversations happened before they joined the Trump campaign, statements rebutted by the Justice Department's timeline.
Charging documents paint a picture of Papadopolous as eager to leverage their relationships with the professor and the Russian woman as part of their role with the Trump campaign. They told a group of fellow foreign policy advisers and Trump themselves during a spring 2016 meeting that they could use their connections to broker a meeting between Trump and Putin, authorities said.
To that end, Papadopoulos allegedly emailed a Russian with connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, forwarding information from the correspondences to a top campaign official not identified in the documents. On numerous occasions, they tried to negotiate a meeting with either Trump or campaign officials and "members of President Putin's office" as well as the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, officials said.
Those meetings never occurred, but officials in the Trump campaign appeared to encourage their efforts.
When Papadopolous told one campaign official about their early attempts to work with the professor and the Russian woman to orchestrate a meeting, the supervisor told them in an email: "Great work."
The campaign supervisor also encouraged them to take an "off the record" meeting with Russian officials "if it is feasible," according to the emails
A second campaign official at one point said Trump themselves shouldn't take any trip to meet with the Russians; instead, "it should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal."
While Papadopolous disclosed the meeting with the professor to FBI agents during a January interview, they told them that they spoke before they joined Trump's campaign, authorities said, adding that they sought to play down their own interest in the professor's claims because they thought the man was "BS'ing" him.
According to authorities, Papadopoulos told them about the professor: "This isn't like he's messaging me while I'm in April with Trump."
"This was a year ago, this was before I even got with Trump."
But the FBI found that the meetings happened after Papadopoulos had been told they would join the campaign and that the professor's interest in them only stemmed from their position with Trump's campaign.
They also allegedly made a similar claim about their relationship with the Russian woman, arguing that they had only exchanged pleasantries with them when they had in fact emailed them about arranging meetings between the Russians and Trump representatives.
Following their interview with the FBI, authorities say Papadopoulos deactivated the Facebook account that had information about their conversations with both the professor and the Russian with connections to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They also changed their cell phone number.
Papadopoulos's name emerged in media reports back in August, after The Washington Post uncovered internal emails they sent offering to broker a meeting with the campaign and the Russians.
The Post reported at the time that Trump aides didn't warm to the idea, with some top officials raising concerns that a meeting could either violate federal law or reflect poorly on the campaign.
The former Trump aide faces up to five years in prison, a fine of $250,000 and supervised release as part of a plea deal with the government. But the agreement notes that prosecutors estimate he'll serve no more than six months in jail and face a fine between $500 to $9,500 as long as they aren't found to have committed any additional crimes.
Their plea deal could open the door for further cooperation with the special counsel's investigation, something noted on Twitter by former U.S. District Attorney Preet Bharara, a vocal Trump critic who was fired by the president.

Cattaraugus County District Attorney Lori Pettit Rieman told the father of Richard A. Metcalf Jr. Friday morning they will not bring any criminal charges against Erie County Holding Center deputies in their death, according to the family's attorney.
Rieman issued a written statement Friday afternoon saying they have concluded, "unfortunately, that there is insufficient proof to bring criminal charges against any of the involved parties."
They also said they want what happened to Metcalf to "prompt serious changes at the Holding Center, even if it is as the result of the public civil trial and subsequent finding of civil negligence."
Rieman also offered what they described as their "personal opinion" that "Richard Metcalf's death was completely preventable."
The five-year statute of limitations on potential charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide expired a few weeks ago, leaving the only potential charge against the deputies being murder, attorney Thomas J. Casey said.
"The fact pattern in this case doesn't fall within that category," Casey said. "The statute is five years except for murder and this was not a murder case."
Metcalf, of Lancaster, died Nov. 30, 2012. A spit mask had been knotted around their neck and a pillowcase was pulled over their head as they were being wheeled by jail deputies out of the Holding Center two days earlier. They were 35.
Then-Erie County District Attorney Frank A. Sedita III declined to press charges in the case. The state Commission of Correction found that missteps by Erie County Sheriff Timothy B. Howard's jail deputies caused Metcalf's death. A 2016 report by the commission urged Erie County prosecutors to take another look at the death. The investigation was handled by Cattaraugus County because one of the prosecutors in the Erie County District Attorney's Office is married to a jail official who is a key figure in the case.
"Metcalf's death was a homicide caused by restraint methods used by Erie County deputies," the commission found in October 2016.
A spokesperson for Howard declined comment Friday.
Casey said they and Metcalf's father, Richard Metcalf Sr., met with the district attorney Friday morning for more than an hour.
"We're very appreciative that they afforded us the opportunity to sit down and talk with her," Casey said. "She's the first prosecutor that's done that."
Richard Metcalf Jr., who had never been diagnosed with a mental illness, jumped through a window on Nov. 25, 2012. Two days later, they broke into Joseph's Country Manor and Grove and, despite the cold temperatures, had left their apartment in bare feet and wanted to cool down in the Manor's walk-in refrigerator. Depew police shocked them twice with a Taser after they reportedly came at them with a metal wrench.
They were taken to Erie County Medical Center for evaluation, then back to the Depew police station where authorities said they were smearing feces on themselves and the cell floor. They were then taken to the Holding Center and brought back to ECMC later that day after some type of assault.
At the Holding Center on the night of Nov. 28, 2012, Metcalf was reportedly saying they were "radioactive," repeating the words "slaughter house" and picking at their arms with a plastic fork, drawing blood and refusing to willingly go to the medical unit, according to jail personnel.
About a half-dozen deputies forcibly removed them from their cell and they began spitting blood while they were being transported. The spit mask was put on in an examination room in the medical unit, and they chewed through it, leading to personnel putting a pillow case over their head.
They were again taken to a hospital. They had been in cardiac arrest for at least 10 minutes by the time they arrived at Buffalo General Medical Center, according to the commission's report. Jail deputies did at least four things wrong as they tried to prevent Metcalf from spitting blood in their direction, the commission found.
Rieman, the Cattaraugus County DA, has previously questioned the credibility of the state forensic pathologist who concluded Metcalf was strangled. They also refused to speak with the emergency room physician who examined Metcalf on the night of Nov. 28, 2012.
In their statement Friday, Rieman cited the two different causes of death determined in the autopsy and the "Medical Review Board" of the commission. Because of the differences, "it would be difficult, if even possible, to convince a jury of 12 persons that criminal liability should be imposed where the case of death is disputed."
They went on to point to multiple opportunities for Metcalf's death to have been prevented.
"I also agree with the Correction's Commission [sic] that, had Mr. Metcalf received appropriate crises level [sic] mental health care for their acute mental health crisis with proper restraint methods and pharmacologic interventions, their death could have been prevented."
I've been having a rough couple of days with a heavy work schedule, and today was the busiest day out of the last four 11-hour shifts I had to work.
I get home today and find a package from Coolstuffinc. Well that's strange, I didn't order anything, but it's addressed to me. I open it up and it's a copy of Arctic Scavengers + the expansion.
I'm floored. This is amazing. Arctic Scavengers was the first game I played when I really started getting into the hobby, and to get it in this gift exchange really, really, really brightened my day. Between the headache I'm having and the stress of work, this brought me to the edge of tears.
Thank you santa, whoever you are. I wish you had included your name on here.
I can't remember a hard and fast date for the Pythons invading my brain. I have this sense of my father being happy to watch it with me and my brother ‚Äì that was cool. But I can't picture us all sitting in front of the telly. I can, however, distinctly remember listening to the albums, playing Matching Tie and Handkerchief and Holy Grail over and over until I could repeat: "Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses not some farcical aquatic ceremony!"
Listening to the sanity of their insanity again and again was very reassuring when one was dealing with the rigid nature of a boarding school (no training shoes to be worn on a Sunday, when other casual clothes were allowed because ‚Äì obviously ‚Äì the world would explode). I remember, too, sitting with Johnny Payne in chemistry at the age of 16, reciting The Four Yorkshiremen sketch endlessly, which was actually a pre-Python Python sketch from At Last The 1948 Show.
By this time, I was becoming somewhat encyclopedic. It was illegal to watch TV at my school so I missed a lot of the shows and had to catch up later. Bizarrely, this didn't happen until the early 2000s, when I was in Los Angeles and could afford to buy all the videos.
They are the most influential comedy group in the entire history of the world, but Monty Python's Flying Circus didn't just do comedy ‚Äì they changed the nature of comedy by making it an art form, something that worked on many levels. They proved, without knowing it, that humour is international and not national.
There is no British sense of humour, no American sense of humour, no Australian, Irish or Russian sense of humour. There is only humour that is produced by a British person, an American, a Russian, and so on. This is why their sense of humour has spread so well around the world. But not to everyone ‚Äì just to the people who are smart enough to realise that being able to think like a child is an important attribute of being an adult. When you lose that ability, you start to die.
They also had a huge effect on my standup. I tried desperately to become a sketch comedian and get on to TV in the early 80s. That didn't work. So in 1985, I decided to become a street performer. That didn't work either, but it did take me away from playing characters and I learned to develop my own voice, talking directly to the audience, which I felt was really important. You couldn't do sketches on the streets: street audiences didn't have the attention span for that.
Then, in 1988, I went into standup, the obvious new hot medium. I found that incredibly hard: it was my third medium of comedy and I'd had a lot of failure. But slowly the two halves came together. The street narrator was talking about comic ideas ‚Äì and the Python-influenced comedy performer started acting them out in sketch form, but with me playing all the character roles and not having to change into costumes or build sets. By the early 1990s, it was finally working.
I think of Monty Python as the comedic offspring of Spike Milligan and The Goon Show, who were the godfathers of surreal comedy. Its essence is intelligence and silliness. The more intellectual the context, the more silly the scene must be. I believe surreal comedy could have developed as a spinoff from Dadaism, the avant-garde movement that swept Europe in the early 1900s. I don't know if it affected Spike Milligan but, (though it seems likely ‚Äì their poems and cartoons were pretty Dadaist) but I do think they were the one who really started surreal comedy.
The Goons influenced Monty Python and Monty Python influenced the world. From my own study of comedy history, there wasn't a whole load of surreal comedy in America until the Pythons arrived on the Public Broadcasting Service channel in 1974. And they must have had an influence on Saturday Night Live, which started in America the following year. So it was the Pythons who spread surreal comedy around the English-speaking world.
As I have toured overseas, I've found that mentioning Monty Python gets a huge response from audiences. I don't think they created their comedy to get well known globally, but that is what has happened. They kicked the door open for other British (and Irish) comedians to play wherever they want.
The Pythons were all proven TV writers and performers before they became Monty Python ‚Äì writing some brilliantly insane sketches and playing some wonderfully inspired characters. But the touch of genius might have been when Eric Idle brought Terry Gilliam in to do animations for Do Not Adjust Your Set, the pre-Python children's show they made in the late 1960s with Michael Palin and Terry Jones. I think Gilliam being an artist and cartoonist gave them a visual dimension no other comedy series has ever matched. The fact that they were an American in an all-British group also helped stir the creative pot. For in life, it is the blend of your genes that makes you strong and not their purity (which leads to congenital defects). I feel the same is true of creative partnerships and Monty Python had ‚Äì and have ‚Äì immense strength in the blend of its genes.
While early Python was a wonderful mix of intelligence and silliness, later Python ‚Äì their Brian period ‚Äì became more layered. Take Life of Brian. When they are hiding from Roman soldiers and pretending to be a prophet, you start with the silliness of them trying to make up cod sermons to a sceptical audience. Then, by running off in mid-sentence, they cause the cynical group to become intrigued.
They start following Brian to hear what they were going to say (which wasn't anything) and become obsessed with the "secret" they have withheld. He's still running from the Romans, so they keep moving but the crowd grows and they gain more and more followers. They drop a shoe since they are running too fast, and gives away a gourd that they didn't want, and suddenly these things become important to these "followers". But the followers start arguing about the meaning of the shoe and the gourd and so we get schisms among the believers.
There, in the space of just 10 minutes, you have a complete breakdown of how religions have developed and fragmented over the centuries ‚Äì right up to the big scene where John Cleese ends up demanding: "Kill the unbeliever!"
It will be wonderful to see them on stage. Their last performance was at the Hollywood Bowl in 1980. Some people will wonder how the shows will play out but, as long as the Pythons are having fun, the audience will be behind them. I'll be on tour for the first three shows, but I will be there for the final seven. Monty Python are a living legend ‚Äì and how often to you get to see a legend?

Halfords' Cycle2Work scheme has announced a ten per cent increase in customers as it hits its tenth anniversary.
According to the retailer, which says its Cycle to Work scheme is the biggest in the UK, it has seen a significant trend towards women joining ‚Äì one in four new joiners are women. At M&S 42 per cent of employees using the scheme are women while other schemes with a high number of women taking part include Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust at 50 per cent, and Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust with 57.5 per cent female participants.
Victoria Pendleton, who retails their line of bikes through Halfords, marked the anniversary by joining staff from M&S, one of the most recent companies to sign up to Halfords Cycle2Work.
Gary O'Neill, Rewards and Benefits manager for M&S said: "We want to help make it easier for our employees to live healthier lifestyles and cycle2work enables us does just that. It's fast become one of our most popular employee benefits and we hope to see even more people join during this year's window for sign up."
Halfords Corporate Sales manager Charles Ashwell said: ‚ÄúIt is extremely encouraging to see a more balanced demand from employees looking to enjoy the benefits of cycle2work.‚Äù
Pendleton said: ‚ÄúIt is great that Cycle2work is appealing to more women as I know a lot of people have busy lifestyles and can struggle to find time for exercising. If you can commute by bike then do it ‚Äì it's a great way to stay fit and healthy.‚Äù
A study by the umbrella body Cycle To Work Alliance reveals the benefits of membership for employers and employees. Around 85 per cent of participants noticed their health improving, 84 per cent of users rates the scheme an important and easy way to keep fit and 97 per cent of businesses sees the scheme is an important way to encourage a healthy workforce.
Scheme users are cycling a total of 13,222,620 miles per week and 67 per cent of participants would commute to work by car if they did not cycle there. These commuters are saving 112,210 tonnes of CO2 in annual reduced carbon emissions. To date over 550,000 people from 32,000 companies have taken advantage of the scheme since it was launched by the Government to encourage workers to commute by bike.
Halfords added that its c2w scheme is able to supply 'virtually all bike brands available in the UK through both its own stores and Independent Bike Shop partners'.

Christine Belford (born January 14, 1949) is an American television and film actor. They have sometimes been credited as Christina Belford.
Early life [ edit ]
Christine Riley was born in Amityville, Long Island, New York to Joseph J. Riley and Mary Belford Riley (n√©e Wilson; later Malone), [1] [2] who later divorced. They have a brother, Terry, and a sister, Shawn. The family once lived at 112 Ocean Avenue, the location which later became famous as the setting of The Amityville Horror, for about five years from age 11 until age 16. As a young child and teenager on Long Island, they were active in equestrian trials and won many horsemanship awards. [3] "She was enrolled at the best schools and joined the best swimming and yachting clubs on Long Island." [4] After graduating from high school in 1966, they attended Hofstra University, initially interested in pursuing a career in psychiatry. However, the classwork they did with Joseph Leon, the head of the drama department, inspired them to become an actor.[3]
In 1970, after college they moved to New York City and did some modeling work but no acting. Additionally, they said, "In order to keep a roof over my head and to eat, I took any job I could get. I was a waiter, a bar maid, and I also drove an ice truck." [5] For both personal and professional reasons, they moved to Los Angeles near the end of 1970. There, at the suggestion of a friend, actor Carrie Snodgress, they auditioned at Universal Pictures, performing a scene from the film The Country Girl for the head of talent, Monique James. Christine then received a seven-year acting contract from Universal Pictures [3], "A very precious commodity issued only to a chosen few." [6]

Voiceover career [ edit ]
From the 1990s to the present, Belford has done much voiceover work, including commercials, animations, promotional spots, and narrations.[citation needed]
Personal life [ edit ]
Belford has been married to actor Nicholas Pryor since July 1993.[10]
TORA, Egypt ‚Äî In a few days' time, I will complete 365 days of imprisonment, more than half spent in solitary confinement and under severe limitations in the maximum-security Scorpion wing of Tora prison in Cairo. I have spent the past year thinking about what drove me to where I am today. I have also been thinking about an explanation for why politicians, human rights activists and the media have largely been silent about my case.
I am an engineer by education and an educator by profession. After the Egyptian revolution in 2011, I became interested in politics. I joined the presidential campaign and then found myself chosen to be the foreign relations secretary to Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, in July 2012.
When the military ousted Mr. Morsi's government, it was predictable that the president and their aides would pay a heavy price. I made the decision, along with eight other staff members, to wait with the president for the moment of their arrest on July 3, 2013. On the orders of the newly appointed secretary of defense, the chief of the Republican Guard arrested Mr. Morsi along with the rest of us. I expected this. What I did not expect was the silence that followed our arrests.
Over the year of Mr. Morsi's presidency, our government met with scores of world leaders, either through official visits or during international conferences. I attended almost every meeting as the president's note-taker. We worked closely with Western leaders and their envoys to broker peace in the region.
The jam was reportedly caused by the joint rally of Aam Admi Party (AAP) and Lok Insaaf Party near the venue on Gill Road Sunday afternoon in Ludhiana. (PTI)
An ambulance got ‚Äòstuck' in a traffic jam due to which a 60-year-old woman lost their lives. The jam was reportedly caused by the joint rally of Aam Admi Party (AAP) and Lok Insaaf Party near the venue on Gill Road Sunday afternoon in Ludhiana. Avtar Kaur,a resident of New Shimlapuri was admitted to the Grewal Hospital at Gill road on Sunday morning. The old woman was suffering from low blood sugar and loose motions. They were referred to Krishna Hospital at Model Town after their condition deteriorated.
According to their family the ambulance got stuck in a traffic jam caused by the rally that was being addressed by Arvind Kejriwal. Them son, Davinder Singh, alleged, ‚ÄúWe were stuck in the traffic jam for 20-25 minutes. The jam was massive due to the rally and I repeatedly asked people to let the ambulance pass but none gave us way. They died in the ambulance.‚Äù
Singh blamed the political party for their mother's death, and they protested later by lying on the road. DCP Dhruv Dahiya was quoted by Indian Express as saying that after the death of the woman, their family protested on road but they did not lodge any written complaint as of then and left after protesting for few minutes.

Ashok Kumar, associated with Grewal Hospital also confirmed that due to traffic jam they were unable to move the ambulance and as the patient was in a serious condition they could not be saved.
The Western press and social media often seem to exercise two options for dealing with the Muslim population of the world: overt, unabashed Islamophobia or slightly subtler Islamophobia.
As Georgetown University's John L Esposito writes in the foreword to Nathan Lean's The Islamophobia Industry: How the Right Manufactures Fear of Muslims, 9/11 and other terror attacks "have exacerbated the growth of Islamophobia exponentially" and resulted in a situation in which "Islam and the Middle East often dominate the negative headlines", thanks in part to the calculated machinations of "a number of journalists and scholars".
Needless to say, the aftermath of 9/11 did not yield much thoughtful consideration on the part of the mainstream punditry as to the context for such events. According to one prominent narrative, 9/11 was simply evidence of an inherent and unfounded Muslim hatred of the West.
A notable exception was veteran British journalist Robert Fisk. In an article published in The Nation immediately following the attacks, Fisk issued the following prescient warning:
"[T]his is not really the war of democracy versus terror that the world will be asked to believe in the coming days. It is also about US missiles smashing into Palestinian homes and US helicopters firing missiles into a Lebanese ambulance in 1996 and American shells crashing into a village called Qana and about a Lebanese militia - paid and uniformed by America's Israeli ally - hacking and raping and murdering their way through refugee camps."
The sale of the "war on terror", Fisk stressed, depended on the obscuration of all details regarding past and continuing devastation of Arab lands and lives - including US State Department-applauded sanctions that eliminated half a million children in Iraq - "lest they provide the smallest fractional reason for the mass savagery on September 11".
Outlets such as Fox News took advantage of the opportunity to impute mass savagery to select Arab populations via de-contextualised post-9/11 headlines like, "Arafat Horrified by Attacks, but Thousands of Palestinians Celebrate; Rest of World Outraged".
'Muslim Sickos'
The demonisation of Muslims by certified sociopaths such as Pamela Geller comes, of course, as no surprise. However, the subtler dissemination of similar sentiments in Western mainstream discourse underscores the fundamental utility of the sociopathic sector in making institutionalised prejudice appear more rationally benign.
For example, according to Dr Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, executive director of the Institute for Policy Research and Development in the UK:
"[a] study commissioned by the Greater London Authority of 352 articles over a randomly selected one-week period in 2007, found that 91 percent of articles about Muslims were 'negative'."
As it turns out, a little journalistic trick called "the invention of information" may come in handy in the proliferation of negativity. A 2008 article by Peter Oborne in the British Independent - titled "The shameful Islamophobia at the heart of Britain's press" - catalogues some of the news industry's more egregious deviations from the truth, such as a front-page story in The Sun announcing that a "Muslim hate mob" had vandalised a home and left a "F*#! off" message in the driveway.
As Osborne notes, The Sun quoted MP Philip Davies' opinion that "[i]f there's anybody who should fuck off, it's the Muslims who are doing this kind of thing". Osborne adds:
"But there was one very big problem with The Sun story. There was no Muslim involvement of any kind."
Other instances of scaremongering discrimination and deceit cited in the Independent report include:
1. A front-page newspaper headline implying that "Muslim Sickos" were to blame for the disappearance of a young girl. The corresponding text reportedly revealed that the so-called "Muslim Sickos" merely suggested on the internet that the girl's parents were involved in their kidnapping.
2. A Daily Express article "claim[ing] that NatWest and Halifax had removed images of piggy banks from their promotional material in an effort to avoid offending Muslim customers".
3. A story about a Muslim bus driver commanding passengers to disembark at prayer time.
Beards and civilisation
John L Esposito highlights some of the disconcerting repercussions of pervasive Islamophobic rhetoric in the US in their foreword to The Islamophobia Industry. According to a 2006 USA Today-Gallup Poll of non-Muslim Americans, Esposito writes:
"[f]ewer than half the respondents believed that US Muslims are loyal to the United States. Nearly one-quarter of Americans - 22 percent - said they would not like to have a Muslim as a neighbour; 31 percent said they would feel nervous if they noticed a Muslim man on their flight, and 18 percent said they would feel nervous if they noticed a Muslim woman on their flight. About 4 in 10 Americans favour more rigorous security measures for Muslims than those used for other US citizens: requiring Muslims who are US citizens to carry a special ID and undergo special, more intensive, security checks before boarding airplanes."
It's not enormously difficult to see how such a climate would spawn record levels of anti-Muslim violence in the country.
The de facto criminalisation of certain types of facial hair and other signifiers of Islamic piety is meanwhile aided and abetted by certain journalistic manoeuvers such as references to "bearded savages" and the like in the mainstream press.
A 1998 New York Times feat of Orientalist travel writing entitled "Exotic Oman Opens Its Doors" begins:
"Think of the Persian Gulf and what do you see? Gulf war soldiers, burning oil, bearded fanatics, polluted seas and flat, bleak desert."
Luckily for the author-vacationer, Judith Miller, "exotic" Oman defies stereotypes and proves itself to be an "exquisitely civilised country". As for less fortunate Persian Gulf locales, the same Miller subsequently expanded their talents from providing the Times' readership with detailed descriptions of the turtle egg-laying process on the Omani coast to falsified reports of an Iraqi WMD programme.
In the end, media characterisations of Muslims kill two birds with one stone, justifying oppression at home and imperial devastation abroad.

Based on an incredibly simple concept, Jenga is one of those 'board' games that will never go out of style. But that doesn't mean there isn't room for branded versions that bring something new to the table. (The table that you're trying desperately not to bump.)
Available near the end of July for about $25, the Space Invaders version adds more than just retro nostalgia, a black paintjob, and alien graphics to Jenga. It also offers a new way to play. In addition to the traditional gameplay which has you removing blocks until the tower tumbles, the Space Invaders version offers an alternative where players compete to move their invader block from the top of the tower to the bottom, based on instructions from a spinner.

What hasn't changed, though, is that the loser still has to clean up a mountain of toppled blocks, and isn't that what Jenga's really all about? [USAopoly via Blog de Bringquedo]

UPDATE: based on the many thoughtful and intelligent comments below, I'm downgrading my recommendation to Google to simply stop putting so much weight on the business name as a ranking signal. I can see that there are some benefits to using it in the algorithm. My main complaint is that you can go into GMB and add a keyword to the business name and see an immediate and significant increase in rankings. That shows me that Google is giving this signal too much power. I recommend reading through the excellent comments below.
Notice anything interesting in the screenshot below?
All of these results have some synonym of ‚Äúbellevue dentist‚Äù in the business name.
The business name is one of the strongest local ranking factors and it's starting to piss me off.
Question:
Which business deserves to rank higher in the local search results for the term ‚Äúseattle plumbing‚Äù?
Business Name Links Citations Reviews Pipe Masters, Inc. High quality, no spam. 100% consistent. Listed on the top sites. Plenty of positive reviews. Seattle Plumbing Pros Mostly directory links and blog comments. Inconsistent and way overdone. A handful of spammy looking positive reviews, and a few real looking negative reviews.
Of course, Pipe Masters, Inc. should rank higher, but because of the heavy ranking weight Google puts on the business name, Seattle Plumbing Pros would be more likely to rank, and Pipe Masters, Inc. won't even break into the local pack.
The example above is fictitious, but back in the days of the descriptors, we saw many examples where keywords in the business name had a huge impact on rankings. You'd add the descriptor, and they'd jump from position 32 in Maps to position B in the local pack. Now, they're stripping descriptors automatically, and when that happens, the rankings tank.
Google, Here's a Quick Fix
Hey Google, I have a suggestion. Rather than bother with all this descriptor stripping, just stop using the business name in the local ranking algorithm. It's a stupid factor to consider anyway. Just because a business happens to have keywords in their business name doesn't mean they're a better business to rank for the term.
If you stopped using the business name, you'd eliminate the problem of people spamming this field, and you'd get better results because REAL businesses that have non-keyword stuffed names would be able to surface into the local pack.
Come on. Just do it. Please? Otherwise, this is gonna be me the next time I see a local pack crammed with keyword spammed business names, and you wouldn't want that, would you?
What do you think? Should Google stop using the business name as a local ranking factor?

Happy Friday. We began the day with one "Trump expands the map!" data point in Arizona, and here's another In fairness, Cruz also trails Clinton in this poll, but by a smaller margin. The favorability story is a depressingly familiar one, too. Keep in mind that this is a reddish swing state:I'll leave you with the latest anti-Trump ad, which highlights their dreadfully weak general election numbers (even in places like Utah and Mississippi ), especially among women -- followed by a major outlier survey that finds Cruz ahead of Trump by 16 points in Indiana. Color me skeptical:
Donald Trump yesterday fired off a verbal salvo at North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, picking on the latter's height and weight as the two leaders kept up their word war.
The US president issued a sarcastic tweet in an apparent response to recent descriptions of them in North Korean media as a "lunatic old man."
"Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me 'old,' when I would NEVER call them 'short and fat'?" Trump tweeted from Hanoi.
Before yesterday's blast, Trump had referred to Kim as a "madman" and "Rocket Man" prompting the latter to deride the US leader as a "mentally deranged dotard."
Trump has played hawk and dove with the North of late denouncing it as a "cruel dictatorship," while offering Kim a diplomatic way out of the crisis over Pyongyang's growing nuclear arsenal.
Trump was a bit conciliatory yesterday.
"Oh well, I try so hard to be their friend - and maybe someday that will happen!" they wrote.
A mutation that allows cells to grow out of control could also provide a new way to target and destroy cancer cells. This potential Achilles' heel comes from a mutation in a gene called PTEN, which is found in a wide range of cancers.
PTEN is one of many tumour suppressor genes that we have to prevent our cells from growing out of control. If the PTEN gene stops working because of a mutation, it can cause tumours to develop ‚Äì indeed many tumours have a mutated form of PTEN. However when a door closes, a window opens: the PTEN mutation helps the tumour to grow, but it could also mark it out as a target.
Researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research, London, found that switching off another gene known as NLK killed tumour cells that had the PTEN mutation. This makes NLK a good target for drug developers to create a new cancer treatment.
The difficult thing about cancer is that it is made of us ‚Äì it is our own cells that have mutated and grow wildly out of control. That means it is unlikely there will ever be a quick fix. Antibiotics work efficiently because bacteria are so different to us that we can develop drugs that target their weaknesses yet barely affect our own cells. But how do you kill something that is the same as you? Current treatments for cancer cause a lot of side-effects in patients because as they try to kill the cancer they also do damage everything else in the body. This is why finding ways to target cancer specifically is so important.
There are several proteins which we cannot live without, and our cells die if the genes responsible for producing those proteins are mutated or switched off. Targeting these proteins and genes are rarely going to be useful for treatments, as they will kill the patient about as quickly as they kill the cancer. So Alan Ashworth and colleagues set out to find proteins that are not essential in healthy cells, but cells with the PTEN mutation cannot live without. This would pave the way for designing drugs that target the tumour and leave healthy cells alone.
The researchers took samples of tumour cells with and without the mutation, and switched off genes for important proteins that are used for regulating lots of processes in the cell. To do this they used small molecules of RNA (DNA's less famous cousin) which interfere with the processes of specific genes. This is why these molecules are known as small interfering RNA (or siRNA). They block the chain of events that allow a gene to produce a protein, effectively switching it off. By switching off 779 genes individually, they could look for ones where cells with the PTEN mutation died and cells without the mutation survived.
This is how the researchers discovered the powerful effect of switching off the NLK gene. They are not certain how this works but it appears to protect a protein called FOXO1 that can act as a backup tumour suppressor and cause the cancer cell to die. When PTEN is mutated, the FOXO1 protein becomes vulnerable to a process called phosphorylation, which means it is ejected from the cell nucleus and destroyed. NLK is one of the proteins that phosphorylates FOXO1 and so by switching off the NLK gene, FOXO1 is able to do its job.
This is just the start of a long journey from the lab to (potentially) the hospital. The researchers have shown that targeting NLK is more likely to kill mutated cells than normal cells, but that does not mean it is safe. NLK still has a role to play in healthy cells and preventing it from working is likely to have side-effects, but it could be worthwhile if this approach can kill tumours. The next stage is to develop a drug to stop the NLK protein from working, so that it can be tested further in cells and in living organisms.
Promising leads against cancer appear often, yet very few ever make it as treatments. One big hurdle is making it through clinical trials; the new drug has to be better than currently available treatments. Targeting NLK would only work against cancers with the PTEN mutation, but now we can use the mutation as a marker to find out which patients that applies to. We are now in the age of personalised medicine, where we can have 100 different treatments for 100 different people with 100 different cancers. Gradually, we are finding ways to attack cancer in whichever form it appears and build up our range of treatments. The weaknesses that we find are not going to cure all cancers, but each one provides another brick in the wall.

In what could be a big win for Grant Park, the Atlanta Urban Design Commission has approved the redevelopment of the former Habitat for Humanity site on Memorial Drive. A proposal submitted to the city by Paces Properties ‚Äî the folks behind Krog Street Market, Stove Works and the Atlanta Dairies proposal just down the street ‚Äî indicates that part of the large warehouse on the site would be converted into commercial space, while another section would be demolished to provide parking for whatever comes along. The approval marks another step forward in the plan to overhaul Memorial Drive from downtown, to Oakland Cemetery and many points east.
In the proposal presented to the city, Paces hints that the Woodward and Loomis Avenue sides of the site may be transformed into retail spaces, with the addition of new windows and doors. An existing loading dock will be converted into parking. The city's description says the proposal includes the entire block, but doesn't offer a hint as to what's in store for a few old homes along Park Avenue. It does specify that a church building at the southeast corner of the block is not part of the development.

Tragic news for some pet owners in Saskatoon as 14 dogs who were being boarded at the Playful Paw Pet Center in Sutherland died overnight from heat exhaustion.
‚ÄúThese dogs mean as much to us as they do to the owners. Some of these dogs have been coming here for years. Those owners are being kind and good to us and understanding, but we're all still devastated with what has happened,‚Äù store manager Bonnie Clark said.
READ MORE: Man and youth charged with causing distress to kitten at Craven Country Jamboree
Saskatoon's SPCA has started an investigation into the deaths, which happened after a roof-top heat system in the facility was said to have malfunctioned overnight, causing the temperature to rise in a specific boarding room.
‚ÄúThe heating system was given an indication it needed to make heat, when it didn't. It started the heat and then it didn't shut off so it caused that room to overheat.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe dogs just went to sleep and passed away,‚Äù Clark said while crying.
The deaths were noticed when employees came to check on the dogs Saturday morning. Many clients and owners who've gone to Playful Paws are showing outrage online because the company's website says, ‚ÄúThe dogs are under constant supervision.‚Äù
Clark says the heating system is check regularly.
‚ÄúWe have a company that comes in and checks them regularly ‚Ä¶ it's been within the last month.‚Äù
Animal control has been notified, but both fire and police say they had not been made aware of the incident.
‚ÄúWe've contacted animal control so when the rumours start they're aware of what happened,‚Äù Clark said. ‚ÄúThey are not coming in to shut us down. They just want to make sure we've done everything we can.‚Äù

News
The Minions of Gozer are thrilled to announce that we'll be calling the IFC Center home for our big debut! On Friday, November 18th and Saturday, November 19th IFC will host the Minions for two performances accompanying midnight showings of Ghostbusters.
Formerly known as the Waverly Theater, this iconic West Village gem became the birthplace of shadowcast entertainment with midnight screenings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show in 1976. The IFC Center is synonymous with the top independent, cult and art film in the city and has long championed innovative, live shadowcast productions (Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Buffy the Vampire Slayer). We're pleased as Ecto Cooler to help them continue this tradition. On Friday, November 18th & Saturday, November 19th, we'll turn Greenwich Village into Slime Square with the first-ever live Ghostbusters shadowcast production. Bring your raincoat because you might get slimed!
A refreshing side-effect of the Octomom phenomenon has been how little abuse Nadya Suleman has taken for their obviously Muslim given name. Them father is apparently from Iraq: In January, they told CBS News that he's a veteran of its military and ‚Äî in a sign of just how feeble the American economy is ‚Äî that they planned on returning to Iraq to find work.
Googling ‚ÄúOctomom‚Äù with ‚ÄúMuslim‚Äù or ‚ÄúIslam‚Äù reveals precious little enmity directed at them Perhaps facetiously, the question has been raised, though she's Christian, of whether she's on a mission from Allah to wage demographic jihad against the West. About the worst I could find was a commenter on Free Republic (where else?), who asked why the state is ‚Äúsubsidizing this Allah worshiper.‚Äù
Perhaps the reason Nadya isn't subjected to more grief is that those inclined to blame them for siphoning off more than their fair share of government aid are part of the same crowd that smiles approvingly at them for acting like a good Christian who goes forth and multiplies. Hey, it's not their fault that the Bible says ‚Äúmultiply‚Äù when what it really means is ‚Äúadd.‚Äù At least it doesn't advise believers to go increase exponentially.
Taking ‚Äúgo forth and multiply‚Äù even more literally than Octomom is the Discovery Channel's Duggar Family, currently weighing in with 18 children. You know them: Michelle Duggar is the mother to whom the phrase-gone-viral ‚ÄúYour vagina is not a clown car‚Äù was applied before Nadya. (Technically speaking, it would be the uterus that one should refrain from using as a clown car.)
As for Nadya's moniker, it's neither been tracked back to a source nor has anyone stepped forth to claim credit for inventing it. That's surprising because, with its allusion to an octopus' tentacles capturing Nadya's apparent need to grab all the babies, attention, and presumably love that they can for herself, it's sheer genius.
The name's potential isn't lost on Nadya, though. Smoking Gun reports that their lawyers filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to trademark the word, which they hope to use as a brand name for disposable diapers and clothes. First, though, their lawyers need to overcome the obstacle presented by a video-game company that beat them to the punch by trademarking the name for an iPhone game. While awaiting the name change, the game is called Fertile Myrtle, after the central character. When players depress their belly, they eject babies.
Octomom is also discussing a reality show with TV networks for the not-too-distant future. At which point, the kids will be old enough to create the requisite pandemonium while they plot their return to the dating scene.
Another public name mentioned in connection with a prospective reality show is Michael Vick (Ookie, as court papers reveal, to their Bad Newz kennel friends). Though their agent claims they seek no such show, their lawyers did mention to a bankruptcy judge that their client hopes to earn $600,000 in a post-prison release documentary.
Perhaps Vick's camp is concerned that a reality show might subvert their plans to be reinstated to the NFL. But a show that portrays Vick performing public service might actually help restore them to the good graces of NFL commissioner Roger Godell.
How about if Ookie moved in with Octomom to help them out and spare the state some public assistance? Their duties would include feeding, bathing, and diapering the the octuplets. (While Nadya, presumably, would plot their marketing.) Ookie would also function as Nadya's BFF, propping up their self-esteem and, when they prepare for a date, applying body make-up to their stretch marks.
But that's not all. To atone for the abuse and murder of dogs, Ookie will raise eight puppies ‚Äî toy dogs, the better to facilitate their humiliation ‚Äî one for each baby: an Australian silky terrier for Jonah, a Bichon Frise for Jeremiah, a Chihuahua for Josiah, a Japanese Terrier for Makai, a Maltese for Nariah, a Pekingese for Isaiah, a Pomeranian for Maliah, and a pug for Noah. They could call it the Good Newz kennel.
And they thought prison was hard.
Caretaker Deepak Shrestha padlocked shut the quake-ravaged remains of the Trailokya Mohan Narayan temple in Nepal's capital Kathmandu to keep out the contractors who are meant to be rebuilding it.
The 17th century monument's three-tiered pagoda completely collapsed in a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit the Himalayan nation in April 2015, leaving the main statue standing exposed on a high plinth.
Shrestha, whose family has looked after the Hindu temple for generations, is now on a mission to protect it from a government system that grants contracts to rebuild the quake-damaged heritage sites to the lowest bidder.
"We had our doubts about the contractors but it was confirmed when they started digging the foundations haphazardly, disregarding the community's involvement and our sacred rituals," Shrestha, 56, told AFP.
"We don't believe the cheapest contractors will rebuild our temple sincerely. We demand that the government dismiss such a system."
The temple was among more than 700 heritage sites damaged in the disaster which killed nearly 9,000 people and destroyed half a million homes.
Nepal's laws state that construction contracts valued at more than 500,000 rupees (S4,670) must be granted through a tender process to the lowest bidder -- and the same rules govern the restoration of ancient temples and buildings.
The system has raised alarm over the quality and techniques being used to rebuild historical sites -- with experts saying the Kathmandu valley's status as a UNESCO World Heritage site could be under threat.
"The lowest bidder is not necessarily the best," Christian Manhart, head of UNESCO in Nepal, told AFP.
"There are strong chances that it can be in the world heritage in danger (list)," they added.
When the UNESCO World Heritage committee met in July last year, it narrowly avoided putting the Kathmandu Valley on its "List of World Heritage in Danger", but warned it could be added in 2017 if progress is not made.
- 'Attack on our heritage' -
The government estimates that rebuilding the centuries-old temples and monuments damaged by the quake will cost over $300 million.
Several countries who have pledged support to help Nepal rebuild its cultural heritage have also expressed concerns about the tender process and the slow pace of work.
Nearly two years since the earthquake struck, only ten monuments have so far been rebuilt -- some totally bypassing the government's rules.
In November last year, the Boudhanath stupa -- the country's largest and one of the holiest sites of pilgrimage in Tibetan Buddhism -- reopened having been restored with donations from international Buddhist groups.
The restoration was largely community-led and cost $2.1 million, including over 30 kilogrammes (66 pounds) of gold.
Bhesh Narayan Dahal, chief of Nepal's archaeology department, said they are aware of concerns regarding the construction contract system and is hopeful the government will respond.
"The demands of local communities are justified... but we are helpless, we cannot work beyond the limits of the government's laws, acts and rules," Dahal said.
In deeply religious Nepal, where temples and heritage sites are an integral part of people's lives, other communities are now demanding that the government process be scrapped and they be allowed to take lead in rebuilding.
However, dozens of contracts to rebuild cultural monuments have already been granted and more are in the process.
Experts also worry that contractors who lack experience of working on heritage projects won't have the contacts to hire traditional wood carvers, stone sculptors and metalworkers.
Birendra Bhakta Shrestha, who is leading a campaign to rebuild Kathmandu's Kasthamandap temple with community involvement, said locals will continue to battle against the tender process.
"Our ancestors have made it and it is our moral right to rebuild it," Shrestha said.
"The Lowest bidders cannot maintain quality... Residents of Kathmandu can tolerate anything, but cannot tolerate an attack on our heritage."
It's almost a clich√©, but nonetheless true: sometimes the left and the right, when they go far enough down their respective rabbit holes, wind up meeting in some strange common burrow and agree, as the wickedly ironic Dr. Frank'N'Furter put it, on the cause, but not the symptom.
It happened in the late '80s, after the Supreme Court struck down Canada's abortion laws, but allowed that in the later stages of pregnancy, abortion can be subject to reasonable limits to protect the developed fetus or the woman's health, and invited Parliament to rewrite the law.
The House of Commons tried; oh, it tried. Lawmakers cannot resist making new laws, otherwise what use are they?
Brian Mulroney, effectively a pro-choice Roman Catholic (against abortion themselves but unwilling to criminalize a woman's decision), wanted a compromise in which militants on both sides of the issue gave some ground.
But it failed, largely because hardline anti-abortion types effectively locked arms with pro-choice absolutists. As a result, Canada is one of the only countries in the world that treats abortion like a tonsillectomy ‚Äì a medical procedure subject only to normal medical regulation.
The left won, in other words.
The next political issue
It's now 30 years later. A slew of hot-button issues has been settled in the meantime, mostly to the satisfaction of the political left. Gay marriage is no longer even remarkable. Corporal punishment is now regarded as assault. Religion is confined to places of worship, and mostly kept out of the classroom. Cannabis will soon be legal.
Among the issues that remain, one of the most prominent is transgender rights. Granted, it's not as seismic as abortion, and it affects far fewer people ‚Äì I'm not even sure I know a transgender person ‚Äì but it's a hot topic.
Risibly, it was a prominent issue in last year's American presidential election. Republican so-cons cried in alarm about allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice, which is the guidance former president Barack Obama gave the nation's schools.
In the view of social conservatives, that invites sinister, perverted men to simply declare themselves women, then waltz into girls' bathrooms and locker rooms and satisfy all manner of disgusting urges.
Republican so-cons cried in alarm about allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. (Facebook CBC)
Conservative Republicans began demanding laws obliging people to use the bathroom of the sex marked on their birth certificate.
Happily, though, the attitudes in broader society are moving as quickly on transgender issues as they suddenly did on gay marriage. Businesses began shunning the state of North Carolina for just such a law.
Transgender activists, sensing their time has arrived, have developed a mildly hectoring playbook, as activists tend to do.
Gender, they tell us, is utterly different from sex; the genitalia you're born with are not reliable indicators.
Anyone, they teach, can identify as any gender, and we must respect that. It seems to be a particularly important issue for millennials; assuming someone's gender merely because of their sex indicates "cisnormative" thinking, which is retrograde and to be avoided.
Bill C-16
Many transgender individuals demand to be referred to by neologisms like "xe" or the plural-singular "they." Most people I know arch an eyebrow at some of the activist vocabulary, but basically, like me, don't really care who's in the next bathroom stall, or what clothes someone chooses to wear. Live and let live.
So it would seem conservatives are outvoted once again. But wait. Once again, they have found allies on the far left.
Of course they have.
As Canada's new law on transgender rights ‚Äî Bill C-16, which seeks to shield "gender expression" and "gender identity" from discrimination or hatred ‚Äî makes its way through Parliament, some feminist activists are warning that it goes too far.
Hilla Kerner, of the Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter, basically told a Senate committee this week that transgender women really aren't women, and threaten the existence of exclusively "female-born" spaces, such as rape crisis centres.
Independent Senator Grant Mitchell, who sponsored Bill C-16 in the Red Chamber, on why it's important this legislation passes 6:36
Women who are not born with vaginas, they said, do not have to suffer the second-class existence of "female-born" women. Instead, they could theoretically choose to be a man if they like, which makes them much more privileged.
Those who are not "female-born," they added, cannot "know the embarrassment of having our clothes stained with blood from our period, the anxiety of facing an unwanted pregnancy and the fear of being raped, and we know the comfort of grouping with other women."
Meghan Murphy, a founder of the website Feminist Current, seconded Kerner's remarks, criticizing the proposed law because "it treats gender as a personal choice."
Well. Republicans Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum and Donald Trump together couldn't have expressed that thought more perfectly.
What Kerner and their fellow travelers are arguing is precisely the same brutish, paranoid thinking put forward by those on the Christian conservative right.
Somehow, they see transgender people, who are in fact mercilessly bullied while growing up and are often grappling with despair and confusion about how they fit in, as threats.
They are not threats. They are the threatened, for heaven's sake. And my guess is they absolutely understand the fear of being raped.
They should expect women like Kerner and Murphy to lend them a hand, not pile on.
When I saw the story about the Senate testimony this week, I sent it to a sharp young gay acquaintance I'm rather close to, inviting comment.
The reply was a link to something called the Urban Dictionary's definition of the term TERF.
A TERF is, apparently, a "trans-exclusionary radical feminist," someone belongs to "that group of feminists that claims that trans women aren't really women, as biological determinism is only a fallacy when it's used against them, not when they use it against others."
Well. I'm not keen on these endless neologistic acronyms, but just so.

The Social Security Administration improperly paid children in juvenile detention facilities $1.7 million, according to a new audit.
The inspector general for the agency found that just four states accounted for the improper disability payments. The estimate for fraudulent payments was "conservative" since the audit did not compile all data from the four states reviewed, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Texas.
"SSA issued about $1.7 million in improper SSI payments on behalf of 547 juveniles confined in correctional facilities in [four] States," the inspector general said. "While SSA had established overpayments for 274 of these juveniles, we identified 273 instances where SSA was unaware of all or part of the confinement period. We determined that 158 of these juveniles were confined for 6 months or longer without SSA's knowledge."
Federal law requires payments on behalf of minors to be discontinued for a full calendar year if the minor is admitted to a correctional facility.
The inspector general reported payments were still being made to 229 minors while they were in detention centers when the audit was conducted. The $1.7 million improper payments were issued in 2016.
"Our findings are conservative because we did not receive data on all confined juveniles in all four States," the inspector general said.
Disability payments for children under age 15 are typically made to a representative payee, such as a parent or guardian who administers the payments on their behalf. Some juveniles between the ages of 15 and 17 may receive payments directly, though they typically have a representative payee as well.
In one case, payments continued to go out for a payee after the minor had been in a juvenile correction facility for nearly three years.
"One payee received over $24,000 in improper SSI payments while the juvenile was confined for 34 months," the inspector general said. "During confinement, the payee completed two redeterminations with SSA and falsely stated the juvenile was living in a private residence and had not been confined in a correctional facility for a calendar month."
In most cases cited in the audit, the representative payee lied to the government in order to continue receiving payments for the incarcerated child.
One individual who received $9,500 in improper disability payments had another minor pose as their child when talking to authorities in order to keep receiving the payments.
Other cases included $18,000 in fraudulent payments for a juvenile confined for over two years, and $17,000 for a minor confined for 23 months.
The inspector general said the federal government needs more communication and agreements to share data with state juvenile correction facilities.
"Although SSA has numerous memorandums of understanding (MOU) with correctional facilities to obtain information on incarcerated adults, it did not obtain such information on all confined juveniles," the inspector general said. "For example, one State did not have MOUs with juvenile facilities, one State had an MOU with only one county, and two States provided data on juveniles confined in State correctional facilities but not at local juvenile facilities Statewide."
"Without MOUs, SSA must rely on other sources, such as self-reporting by juveniles' representative payees (for example, parent, legal guardian, relative, social agency, or institution)," the inspector general added. "Unless such individuals notify SSA, it may continue making monthly SSI payments while the juvenile is confined, thus creating overpayments."
Perovskites are a set of materials with a crystalline structure that can be organic, inorganic or a mix of the two. Researchers at Stanford have been studying the materials, exploring their potential for use in solar applications in the hope of finding an alternative to silicon-based solar cells.
‚ÄúA perovskite refers to a crystal structure, a crystalline material,‚Äù explains Stanford University professor of materials science and engineering Reinhold Dauskardt. ‚ÄúAn example would be salt; sodium chloride has a perovskite crystal structure. Some compositions that happen to have perovskite crystal structures are also good photovoltaic materials, in other words, they absorb light and produce charge carriers that can then be used to power a solar cell. The most typical example of that is methylammonium lead iodide.‚Äù
Interest in perovskites has been limited for a long time due to their unstable nature; however, breakthroughs in 2009 signalled change, with research growing steadily over the last few years. Perovskites are highly efficient and easy to process. Their power conversion efficiency has now reached >20%, competitive with the 26.6% world record efficiency of a silicon photovoltaic cell. This efficiency can be achieved whilst processing costs dramatically drop because perovskites can be processed simply by making them into a precursor solution and depositing them on a substrate, thereby creating a solar cell.
Too unstable to succeed
Despite the clear advantages of using perovskites in photovoltaics, they have been held back by the material's instability. They are both mechanically and chemically unstable, so the conditions that affect and alter it are wide-ranging.
‚Äú[Perovskite is] also mechanically extremely fragile, it has one of the lowest fracture energies, which means resistance to failure either by delamination or by simply just cracking in the perovskite layer itself,‚Äù says Dauskardt.
The brittle nature of perovskites has made them inappropriate for solar panels, as they must be able to operate outside for years despite wind, rain and other environmental factors. If perovskites lack the strength to endure even the slightest knock, there is no economic case for using them instead of traditional silicon-based photovoltaics.
Chemically, perovskites have been seen as less appealing than conventional solar cells as they degrade very quickly. They are particularly affected by heat, making them unsuitable for the sunny and warm environments in which solar cells generally operate best.
‚ÄúYou don't have to go to super-high temperatures; you just have to go to tens of degrees above room temperature for the material to become increasingly unstable,‚Äù says Dauskardt. ‚ÄúIn addition, it's very sensitive to moisture, so if moisture were to diffuse into the solar cell then it would interact with the perovskite and basically cause it to decompose.‚Äù Ambient conditions alone can cause the efficiency of perovskites to reduce by over 80% within just 28 hours.
Taking inspiration from nature
It was the instability, especially the mechanical instability, of perovskite that Dauskardt and their team at Stanford University set out to tackle, finding inspiration in nature and ceramics.
‚ÄúWell, I had been thinking for a long time that we couldn't change the inherent properties of the perovskite material, and that means we couldn't make it into a more stable material by itself because in doing that you would basically lose all of the optoelectronic properties, so it just wouldn't be an effective photo absorber anymore,‚Äù explains Dauskardt.
‚ÄúIn the case of ceramics, if you did this by trying to change the inherent properties then you would just turn it into another material and you'd lose all of the high-temperature properties or the corrosion-resistant properties,‚Äù they continue. ‚ÄúSo the key was to extrinsically toughen or extrinsically shield the material. They did things like put fibres in it, the fibres could carry all of the mechanical stresses and the ceramic would be in some ways kind of shielded from the mechanical environment.‚Äù
This concept of extrinsically shielding a material was crucial to the team's breakthrough with perovskites. It was here that nature offered a helping hand, after Dauskardt noticed the scaffolding structure of a fly's eye. Within each of a fly's two eyes, there are thousands of ommatidia, or simple eyes. These ommatidia are exceptionally fragile, but being compounded and protected within a scaffold makes them durable.
‚ÄúSo nature had this beautiful example of extrinsic shielding and the notion of a compound eye, and that's what led us to think of building a scaffold that was tough and durable to mechanical loads, and then to create these individual solar cells,‚Äù says Dauskardt. ‚ÄúAnd it worked, it worked extremely well.‚Äù
Building a scaffold for solar cells
Dauskardt and their team set about testing the concept of a reinforced scaffold to solve the mechanical instability of perovskites. Using photolithographic methods, they were able to construct a hexagonal scaffold just 500 microns wide out of a durable polymer. Within this, they built the perovskite cells.
‚ÄúWhat we've found is that not only is it mechanically much more durable, but it's also chemically more stable because, as I mentioned earlier on, if you heat up perovskite materials there are certain components in the perovskite that become volatile,‚Äù says Dauskardt. ‚ÄúBy essentially containing each individual cell, we could help slow down the loss of this volatile component of the material.‚Äù
To test the structures, the perovskite cells were kept at 85¬∞C and 80% humidity for six weeks. And in these conditions, the cells continued to generate electricity at a high efficiency.
Although this represents a milestone for perovskites' viability as a solar cell material, there are still challenges to overcome if they are to compete with existing photovoltaic cells. ‚ÄúWe've taken this basic proof of concept and we're now taking them further and developing more efficient scaffold cells,‚Äù says Dauskardt. ‚ÄúWe're learning to deal with the illumination and making sure that we don't lose any light in the scaffold walls themselves because obviously they take up space, and in taking up space they would absorb some of the light that actually shines onto the solar cell.‚Äù
To combat the potential loss of light that comes with using scaffolds, the team is looking at ways to use the structure itself to help scatter light into the cells. As they continue to develop the stability of perovskites, it appears that the compounds may be a significant step closer to reaching their solar potential.
Rob Zombie has a new film in the works that's a departure from their usual work as a horror director. According to Deadline, Zombie will direct a film adaptation of Steve Stoliar's 2011 memoir Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House with Oren Moverman attached to write the script. Here's a summary of the book:
The book tells the bizarre story of the last years in the life of Groucho Marx, told by a young Marx Brothers fan who spent those years as their personal secretary and archivist. In addition to getting to know their hero, the author found themselves in the orbit of Groucho's brothers Zeppo and Gummo, Mae West, George Burns, Bob Hope, Jack Lemmon, S.J. Perelman, Steve Allen, and scores of other luminaries of stage, screen, TV and literature. The downside of this dream-come-true was getting close to their idol as the curtain was coming down, and dealing with Erin Fleming ‚Äì the mercurial woman in charge of Groucho's personal and professional life.
‚ÄúI have been a huge Groucho Marx fan ever since I was a child and have read countless book on the comic legend, but after reading the book Raised Eyebrows, a totally new perspective on Groucho's life emerged,‚Äù Zombie said on the news. ‚ÄúI immediately saw this project as Groucho's Sunset Boulevard and knew I had to bring it to the big screen. It is a sad, funny and very dark tale of one of Hollywood's greatest stars' final years.‚Äù
Ivanka Trump appears on the cover of 'Us Weekly.'
First Daughter Ivanka Trump is appearing on the cover of the latest Us Weekly for a story in which ‚Äúsources close‚Äù to them explain the ways that they disagree with their father.
The magazine's description of the story explains that Ivanka is trying to ‚Äúbalance their personal ideals with love and loyalty to their father,‚Äù while at the same time emphasizing that they ‚Äúwill always fight for what they believe in.‚Äù
Many Twitter users were quick to pounce on the Ivanka story as a calculated attempt to save their personal brand, which has taken a major hit among the young women to whom they pitch their products.

President Trump, at the start of their meeting Saturday in Germany with Chinese President Xi Jinping, called the Asian nation a ‚Äúgreat trading partner‚Äù and said the increasing North Korea nuclear threat will eventually be resolved ‚Äúone way or the other.‚Äù
The much-anticipated meeting was one of several Trump and top administration officials had Saturday with world leaders at the close of the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. But it was considered perhaps the most critical.
China is North Korea's largest trading partner, which gives the country considerable influence over Pyongyang and its growing threat, which includes developing a nuclear warhead and launching long-range missiles to transport them.
NORTH KOREA FIRES BALLISTIC MISSILE
Trump told Xi that putting an end to North Korea's nuclear missile testing ‚Äúmay take longer than I'd like, it may take longer that you'd like. But there will be success in the end one way or the other."
‚ÄúSomething has to be done,‚Äù the president also said.
Xi also spoke briefly, but their comments in Chinese were not immediately translated and available.
Saturday's meeting also focused on trade between the two nations.
Trump said ‚Äúmany things have happened‚Äù that have created trade imbalances between the United States and China but ‚Äúwe're going to turn that around.‚Äù
The president was flanked in the meeting room by about a dozen top administration officials including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and adviser Jared Kushner.
The meeting followed a long-range missile test launch by North Korea on Tuesday, which a Pentagon spokesperson said was a type not previously seen by U.S. analysts.
Following the missile launch, Trump expressed frustration with China over its expanding trade with North Korea. Trump had expressed optimism after their first meeting with China's president that the two would work together to curb North Korea's nuclear pursuits.
The president tweeted Wednesday, "Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us - but we had to give it a try!"
China has long resisted intensifying economic pressure on neighboring North Korea, in part out of fear of the instability that could mount on its doorstep, including the possibility of millions of North Koreans fleeing into China. China has also been concerned that a reunited, democratic Korea -- dominated by South Korea -- would put a U.S. ally, and possibly U.S. forces, on its border.
Tillerson on Tuesday vowed ‚Äústronger measures‚Äù to hold North Korea accountable.
‚ÄúGlobal action is required to stop a global threat,‚Äù they said.
Tillerson also said any country helping North Korea militarily or economically, taking in its guest workers or falling short on Security Council resolutions ‚Äúis aiding and abetting a dangerous regime.‚Äù
However, their statement did not specifically mention China.

Nanotechnology researchers finally succeed in controlling chirality in carbon nanotubes (w/video)
(Nanowerk News) An ultimate goal in the field of carbon nanotube research is to synthesise single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with controlled chiralities. Twenty years after the discovery of SWNTs, scientists from Aalto University in Finland, A.M. Prokhorov General Physics Institute RAS in Russia and the Center for Electron Nanoscopy of Technical University of Denmark (DTU) have managed to control chirality in carbon nanotubes during their chemical vapor deposition synthesis.
Initial carbon cap formation on Co nanoparticles.
Carbon nanotube structure is defined by a pair of integers known as chiral indices (n,m), in other words, chirality.
"Chirality defines the optical and electronic properties of carbon nanotubes, so controlling it is a key to exploiting their practical applications," says Professor Esko I. Kauppinen, the leader of the Nanomaterials Group in Aalto University School of Science.
Over the years, substantial progress has been made to develop various structure-controlled synthesis methods. However, precise control over the chiral structure of SWNTs has been largely hindered by a lack of practical means to direct the formation of the metal nanoparticle catalysts and their catalytic dynamics during tube growth.
"We achieved an epitaxial formation of Co nanoparticles by reducing a well-developed solid solution in Co," reveals Maoshuai He, a postdoctoral researcher at Aalto University School of Chemical Technology.
"For the first time, the new catalyst was employed for selective growth of SWNTs," adds senior staff scientist Hua Jiang from Aalto University School of Science.
By introducing the new catalysts into a conventional CVD reactor, the research team demonstrated preferential growth of semiconducting SWNTs (‚àº90%) with an exceptionally high population of (6,5) tubes (53%) at 500 ¬∞C. Furthermore, they also showed a shift of the chiral preference from (6,5) tubes at 500 ¬∞C to (7, 6) and (9, 4) nanotubes at 400 ¬∞C.
Carbon nanotubes (single-walled) growing from Co nanoparticles.
"These findings open new perspectives both for structural control of SWNTs and for elucidating their growth mechanisms, thus are important for the fundamental understanding of science behind nanotube growth," comments Professor Juha Lehtonen from Aalto University.
The research has been recently published in a new Nature Publishing Group journal Scientific Reports ("Chiral-Selective Growth of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes on Lattice-Mismatched Epitaxial Cobalt Nanoparticles").
In a CNN segment about the current political fallout surrounding Hillary Clinton and the ongoing leaks of the Podesta emails, anchor Chris Cuomo claims that it's illegal for anyone but the media to read WikiLeaks.
This is incorrect.
However, in previous leaks, government employees were threatened with their jobs if they did view such material. In a December 2010 leak of classified military material, The New York Times reports the Obama administration and the Department of Defense ordered federal employees and contractors to not view them unless they had the security clearance.
But for the average American, viewing the material is protected under the First Amendment.
The above video was shared on a Reddit thread dedicated to conspiracy theories. In the thread, Redditors took digs at Cuomo for spreading false information so that the mainstream media could control the narrative of the Podesta WikiLeaks.
As one Redditor agentf90 put it:
With Alex Stalock's time with San Jose quickly expiring, it's natural to take a look at what's going on with the Barracuda for at least a temporary solution. What you'll find there is only pain, friends, only pain.
Even while Stalock was putting together a very nice debut NHL campaign, the writing on the wall (so to speak) was their very not good AHL career numbers. So unless either Troy Grosenick or Aaron Dell have been setting the world on fire for the Barracuda this year, it's unlikely either will (at least longterm) provide a suitable replacement for Stalock.
So right, about those numbers... They aren't great.
Troy Grosenick has a career AHL save percentage of .904 in all situations. For the sake of comparison, Stalock posted a .909 save percentage in 142 career games with the Worcester Sharks. Grosenick has only played 94 games, but they haven't exactly shown anything that would lead me to believe he's going to be the answer in net.
So how about Dell? Their numbers are actually quite good. They have a .923 save percentage in the AHL, but has played only 55 games. This season they and Grosenick have started an equal number of games despite Dell having a far superior save percentage. San Jose could simply be wanting to split up the workload evenly (and give each guy a chance to develop) but given Grosenick's experience, it wouldn't surprise me if he's the guy the Sharks turn to first if they look at the AHL.
Grosenick has played in two NHL games while Dell is waiting to make their debut. Both netminders are 26 years old, so age wouldn't factor into the decision. If it were my call, I'd give Dell a shot in backup duty and see what you have as you've already given Grosenick a couple of NHL games. That being said, I'm just looking at a relatively small sample of saves and am (obviously) not working with or even watching these guys on a day-to-day basis.
That all being said, it seems that if management thought replacing Stalock with Dell or Grosenick was an option, they would have done so by now. It seems a trade is still the most likely way for the Sharks to upgrade their backup goalie situation before the offseason.
There is a new call for the Robert Mueller to step down from leading the Special Counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, this time from the editorial board of .
In an opinion piece published this week, The Wall Street Journal called on Mueller to resign, citing new revelations that the FBI may have worked with the Democrats to spread Russian disinformation against Donald Trump.
"It is no slur against Mr. Mueller's integrity to say that they lack the critical distance to conduct a credible probe of the bureau they ran for a dozen years," the Journal's editorial board wrote. "He could best serve the country by resigning to prevent further political turmoil over that conflict of interest."
The call marks a significant change in tone from the nearly universal praise of Mueller when they were first appointed to lead the special counsel investigation in May.
"This was somebody Donald Trump was seriously considering putting into their own administration," explained Democratic strategist Harrell Kirstein. "What they ultimately are going to be judged by is what they deliver at the end of it."
The concern over Mueller has been linked to a Washington Post report this week that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee helped pay for research that went into . That dossier, written by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele, suggested that Trump's campaign had colluded with Russia and that Moscow had compromising information on Donald Trump.
The report also contained information indicating that the FBI agreed to pay Christopher Steele for the information on Russian election interference and that the former British spy had shopped their dossier on Trump to other foreign intelligence services. At the time, the FBI was being led by James Comey, who was fired by Trump in May.
Former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka agreed that Mueller should step aside, arguing that they cannot be an impartial investigator because of their previous relationship with Comey when the two worked together at the Department of Justice.
"His closeness to James Comey and the fact that they were implicated to the sale of uranium and CFIUS [the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States]," Gorka said citing a controversial deal approved by nine government agencies, including the State Department, then run by Clinton. The deal authorized a Russian-owned company to receive significant ownership of U.S. uranium mining rights.
Despite a Justice Department corruption investigation into the Russian company, the deal was approved in 2010. At the time, Robert Mueller was director of the FBI, a fact that has raised questions among critics.
President Trump has repeatedly attacked the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt," but they and members of their Justice Department have .

Though their pseudonym can come off as ostentatious, Carl ‚ÄúPerfect Legend‚Äù White has never seemed particularly ‚Äúvillainous‚Äù to me apart from the fact that he, at one time, was considered by many to be the best Mortal Kombat player on the planet. That's likely because I'm not as engrained in the communities they call home, but it's this opinion that pushed me to reach out.
‚ÄúAll I really wanted to do at the end of the day is have someone to play with,‚Äù White explained in response to my surprise that they crafted their first tournament experience himself: Ohio Fighting Game Classics, a cooperative effort with friend Tim Fields. ‚ÄúI reached out to whoever I could to come. I wasn't known back then, but people actually came.‚Äù
This ‚Äúbuild it and they will come‚Äù moment was just one of White's numerous fighting game milestones, a long list that stretches back to some of the earliest moments of their life.
‚ÄúI got my first taste [‚Ä¶] when I was four years old,‚Äù White said, describing their earliest experience with Mortal Kombat and the genre in general. ‚ÄúI was going to the arcade every day for a couple years. My dad would take me right after kindergarten and again after they got home from work. Sometimes we would go three times a day and I would just play. That's when I knew, right off the bat, that it doesn't matter how old you are. That was before competing or anything. I just loved fighting games.‚Äù
It's this sentiment that forms the basis of our discussion. White, for all that he's achieved, is still that kid who grew up adoring fighters. They have never given up that love, borne from a childhood, enriched in video games and kung-fu flicks, that preceded any notion of competition or community.
‚ÄúHonestly, I shouldn't be seen as a Mortal Kombat player or a Dead or Alive player or a Street Fighter player,‚Äù White confessed. ‚ÄúI should be seen as a fighting game player because I play a lot of these games. Tekken, Virtua Fighter. I just love fighting games.‚Äù
Still, it's hard to ignore what games for which he's known. Before there was Mortal Kombat for Perfect Legend, there was Dead or Alive, more specifically Tecmo Koei's sophomore effort. While grinding Dead or Alive 2 online, they were directed to check out DOA Central, which at one point was the premier destination for the competitive community. From there, they stumbled on Shoryuken and results for Evo 2003 and 2004. The rest was history.
‚ÄúI started looking through everything I could find, like Seth Killian's Domination 101 series, everything,‚Äù White said. ‚ÄúEverything I would read, I would translate it to relate to me. I would habitually practice Tekken, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, and Super Turbo instead of practicing Dead or Alive. Just playing those games helped me transcend in the games I was playing.‚Äù
Their first major competition was Tournament in Texas, an event hosted by Eddy Pistons that predominantly catered to the Tekken community. They took second in three different games.
After that, White made their first trip to Evo in 2006, where they placed first in Dead or Alive 4 over Emmanuel ‚ÄúMASTER‚Äù Rodriguez, who was something of a legend themselves in those days. But all the drama surrounding their win is the furthest thing from their mind during our conversation.
‚ÄúI was at Evo not just as a player but also as a spectator. I read about this tournament so much, I just wanted to show up. My goal wasn't to win Evo, it was to be highlighted in one of James Chen's trailers. I was like, ‚ÄòI wanna be highlighted like this, I wanna just be [messing] people up.' And every part of the Dead or Alive section in the 2006 trailer was me [messing] somebody up. I loved every second.‚Äù
Despite all their success, numerous factors led to White's transition from Dead or Alive to Mortal Kombat. Issues between creator Tomonobu Itagaki and Tecmo saw the franchise take a lengthy hiatus from 2006 to 2012, and many of the competitive leagues subsequently fizzled out. After a brief flirtation with Street Fighter IV (‚ÄúIf it wasn't for [Wolfkrone] and Bananaken, I would have probably been seen as the top guy in the midwest,‚Äù White said), an old friend from the Dead or Alive era would reintroduce them to the world of fatalities.
‚ÄúTom Brady got me into playing [Mortal Kombat 9] at a high level. I took all the information they gave me and ran with it,‚Äù White continued. ‚ÄúI became obsessed. I just loved studying games.‚Äù
But that doesn't mean things went smoothly. White explains that, at first, they thought the game was garbage. ‚ÄúAt the time, there was no movement. I was tired of getting hit by random supermans, random shadow kicks. I just started block dashing so we couldn't do that anymore. I started whiffing dive kicks and teleporting. I made up this entire way of playing Kung Lao that I hadn't seen before.‚Äù
With a main character and improved movement, White was in the zone, even if their mind wasn't on being the best. They are, again, having fun, and that mindset brought them two more Evo championships: first in 2011 and then again in 2012. They would close out Mortal Kombat 9's tenure with a fifth place finish in 2013.
‚ÄúA lot of people gave me shit for not going to every tournament, but for the first year I went to every tournament I could get to, and then after that I went to the ones that mattered more, the MLGs and the Evos,‚Äù White explained. ‚ÄúMy thing is, if I beat you at Evo, I don't need to beat you again. We'll play again at the next Evo.‚Äù
This echoes some of the criticism leveled at Nicolas ‚ÄúKane Blueriver‚Äù Gonzalez, who has become something of a villain themselves after winning Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 at Evo 2015. After not participating at SoCal Regionals, they were labeled as a champion not willing to defend their title. I was curious what that kind of attention is like, and White was more than happy to share insight from their time on the throne.
‚ÄúIt comes with a lot of pressure. When you become good at anything in life, people expect you to be a certain way or they already think of you a certain way. Everyone thinks I'm an asshole, have a big ego, etc. Yeah, sometimes I feel myself, but sometimes I have to. ‚ÄòOh you suck, you ain't shit, you got lucky.' [Hearing] that every day, sometimes I have to look back and see where I've come from and what I've done up until this point. It's more for me, for my own self-esteem. People forget that me and other players are human.‚Äù
The road through Mortal Kombat X, however, has a few more obstacles.
‚ÄúI knew as soon as the game came out that it was going to be hard for me to practice,‚Äù White said. ‚ÄúThis is how I learn games: I find a character, figure out strategy, and take it online, even if there's lag. It's hard for me to do that now. When I go to ranked match, everybody's like, ‚ÄòOh it's Perfect Legend! Let me put this shit on Youtube!' I'm not allowed to lose, I'm not allowed to learn the game. I have to, out the gate, know everything, be dominant. That's very unrealistic and it's never been like that. It may look like that, but I put a lot of time into Mortal Kombat 9!‚Äù
White is far from the conqueror they once are, relegated to again being the hungry competitor nipping at the heels of a better opponent. In this case, instead of MASTER, it's young Dominique ‚ÄúSonic Fox‚Äù McLean. With two Evo medals of their own as well as a pair of championship victories at the ESL Pro League, it's hard to argue anyone is more dominant than McLean, and no one understands that better than the former reigning champ.
‚ÄúWhen Sonic Fox first came on the scene, everyone called them Perfect Legend Junior. they called them that for like two years because we looked so much alike, they were so good, etc. I was like, ‚ÄòThis kid's gonna be good when they get older.'‚Äù
A high-profile match between the two at Summer Jam 9 would cement Sonic Fox's dominance. ‚ÄúI'm always one to play the high-profile exhibition. It's not about the money, it's about the prestige behind it,‚Äù White said of the match. ‚ÄúThe clashing of two eras‚Äìeveryone likes that.‚Äù Unfortunately, the lack of training, both from constant travel and Mortal Kombat X's poor netcode, would catch up with him.
It wouldn't be a stretch to say White's mindset was entirely backwards, something they freely admit to. They stuck with Kung Lao to, in effect, ‚Äúown‚Äù the character, but the blinders kept them from picking up reliable counters. ‚ÄúI let peoples' perception of me control how I felt about myself, how I felt about my play, everything. I felt like my intentions were in the right place, as far as wanting to help people learn the game, but then it became all about Perfect Legend vs. Sonic Fox.‚Äù
But even with all of that clouding their history, White has nothing but respect for the young player. When I made comparisons between Sonic Fox and past opponents like MASTER, White was quick to dismiss the notion. Where their Dead or Alive rival was a thorn in their side, they don't hold the same animosity towards Sonix Fox.
‚ÄúI actually like the kid. They remind me of me a lot when it comes to picking characters. They have no shame, and I used to be like that,‚Äù White explained. ‚ÄúSonic Fox is the player you want to be as far as not having any kind of pride in your characters. Pick what you need to win. If you gotta counterpick, counterpick. That's why no one is beating them right now.‚Äù More than that, though, White is impressed with Sonic Fox's pure skill and the work ethic the young player has established to remain on top.
Of course, that doesn't mean White is done competing for that crown. Looking up to Daigo Umehara and Justin Wong means they want to attain the same consistency, and that starts with getting their head back in a healthy place. Now that ESL has finished up and they have more time on their hands, it's time for White to get back into the lab and grind. Thankfully, where they once had to offer to pay for players' internet in order to get decent matchup knowledge, the upcoming netcode improvements mean Mortal Kombat X will be easier to practice than ever. White admits to ‚Äúcoasting‚Äù a bit in Mortal Kombat 9, but now he's ready to return to the level of dedication they showed during their days of Dead or Alive competition.
These statements echo those made earlier in the conversation. ‚ÄúNo one is going to care about how you did during the season if you don't win the championship,‚Äù White explained, making clear the importance they place on history. ‚ÄúI feel like I have a much bigger will and determination than other people. I do my best at [tournaments like Evo, ESL, etc.] because I prepare better for them, I care more about them.‚Äù
Other than that, White is hesitant to look too far into the future.
‚ÄúThese last five years alone have been life-changing. I want to just live in the moment,‚Äù White said. Ten years ago, they were preparing for a Dead or Alive 4 competition in Virginia. Evo, world championships, and sponsorships weren't even part of the equation. Just five years ago they were playing in Evo's online Super Street Fighter IV tournament, where they placed third behind Wolfkrone and iPeru. ‚ÄúI will work harder than ever before to bring Team Razer as many championships as I can.‚Äù
The immediate goal is, naturally, Evo, but White's reasons mirror those of their very first visit. Where it was once making it into one of James Chen's trailers, now it's stepping foot on one of the biggest stages the fighting game community has ever seen.
‚ÄúI need to play on the Mandalay Bay stage. I would like to win [Evo], look back at the crowd, look at the titantron in the air. That entire image is what I've been dreaming about my entire career,‚Äù White said. ‚ÄúI need to be a part of history. I have to play on that stage. It doesn't matter who my opponent is, I'm doing whatever it takes to play on that stage.‚Äù
So, is Carl White a heel? I'm inclined to say no. Carl White is, like many of us, a kid who has spent their entire life with fighting games, growing and learning as the genre itself has evolved. Their perception of the world has changed over the years, as have their views on competition and their place in the community.
Perfect Legend is an entirely different story. Perfect Legend is a competitor. Perfect Legend is a champion. Perfect Legend will not back down until they are the best.
And, honestly, what more can you ask for?
Perfect Legend would like to thank all of their sponsors (Razer, DXRacer, Netduma, Alienware, Design by Humans, and Elgato), and shout out some of their biggest influences in the scene, including Justin Wong, Daigo Umehara, Tom Brady, JOP, EP and the entire House of Goons crew in Dallas as well as honorary members, Jeff Schaefer, Alex Valle, David Sirlin, Wolfe Bros, Seth Killian, Jason Cole, Knee, Nin, Holeman, Qudans, Jang Iksu, Ryan Hart, Itabashi Zangief, Fuudo, Tokido, Jackie Tran, Jinkid, Jinmaster, and many more.
‚ÄúIt feels very good to be mentioned in the same breath as the many greats that have come before me.‚Äù
You can follow Perfect Legend on Twitter, Twitch, YouTube, and their official website.
Over the years, Google has been known to test out certain features within its products with small groups of users before deciding whether or not to push them out to the public. The YouTube app has been no exception to this rule, and the latest feature that Google is testing is video playback speed controls within the YouTube Android app‚Ä¶
On YouTube's desktop site, users have been able to control the playback speed of videos for quite some time. This allows you to have a video play faster or slower than its originally uploaded speed, and before now, these settings weren't available on the YouTube mobile app.
Tapping on the three dots in the upper-right corner of the YouTube app while watching a video reveals a menu with options to report a video, change the playback quality, add closed-captions, view the content in Cardboard, and access YouTube's Help and Feedback section. However, it now looks like users (at least some of them) have an option here for changing the speed of a video.
Similar to what you'd find on a desktop, you can slow down the video to 0.75x, 0.5x, or 0.25x its normal speed, or crank it up to 1.25x, 1.5x, or 2x. Changing the speed won't affect the labeled duration of the video you're watching, but it will decrease or increase the playback at the rate you've selected.
I personally just noticed the new speed control option on the YouTube app on my Pixel this evening (I'm currently running version 12.29.57 of the app), but no one else on the 9to5Google team seems to have been granted this same stroke of luck from the Google Mothership. This could be a sign that Google will be rolling out this feature to the masses soon, or it may just be something that the company is toying with that'll never see the light of day.
Do you have video speed controls on the YouTube app? Let us know in the comments!

Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders' resounding wins in New Hampshire drive the lesson home: American voters are fed up with conventional politicians and desperate for something new.
Trump's now the clear GOP front-runner, while Sanders has become a serious threat to beat Hillary Clinton.
Part of that is Clinton's weakness: Even Democrats don't trust them A third of those voting in the party primary Tuesday said honesty was a key issue ‚Äî and those voters broke for Bernie by 18 to 1.
Whether it's the email mess, the Clinton Foundation scandals or their Goldman Sachs speeches ‚Äî or all of it and more (so much more) ‚Äî Democrats are refusing to let Hillary walk away with the nomination.
Even women ‚Äî who Clinton thought were automatically ‚Äúhers‚Äù ‚Äî went overwhelmingly for Sanders.
She's the candidate Democrats know best ‚Äî and they clearly don't like what they see.
Yes, the party's also taken a hard-left turn: Sanders' socialist, soak-the-rich rhetoric has become the Democratic mainstream. Never mind that their proposals are unworkable or unaffordable ‚Äî or both.
Clinton's running as President Obama's heir, but the Democratic base plainly thinks Obama didn't aim high enough.
Meanwhile, GOP voters are furious with their elected officials. Indeed, Trump is galvanizing the angry anti-establishment move¬≠ment first seen in the Tea Party ‚Äî and he's doing it without a traditional ideology, or even many policy specifics.
Trump's populism, free-wheeling rhetoric and unmasked disdain for their rivals have won them a huge following ‚Äî which keeps growing, in utter defiance of conventional political wisdom.
There's more chaos ahead, as voters realize how crazy the parties' rules are.
The Democratic establishment is ensuring that Hillary will get as many delegates out of New Hampshire as Bernie, despite their landslide win. The GOP has given Texas the right to switch to a winner-take-all primary at the last minute.
In short, the leaders of both parties are giving voters even more reason to revolt.
Animal models
Seventy non- or post-lactating adult female greater mouse-eared bats (M. myotis) were caught at their home roost (Orlova Chuka Cave, district Ruse) in Northeast Bulgaria, between 12 July and 7 August, 16‚Äì22 h before the experimental treatment and were kept at the nearby Siemers Bat Research Station, Tabachka. All experiments were carried out under the licence of the responsible Bulgarian authorities (the Bulgarian Ministry of Environment and Water, and Regional Inspectorate (RIOSV) Ruse, permit #465/29.06.2012).
Experimental treatment
For the experiments, bats were put in holding cages at a treatment site 1.3 km away from their cave and offered a clear view of the horizon in all directions from 22 min before until 75 min after sunset (when the last visible post-sunset glow had disappeared). All experimental evenings generally had clear sky and always had a visible sunset with only the exceptional cloud coming up. Bats were placed in holding cages which consisted of an inner (120 √ó 120 √ó 63 mm) and outer (148 √ó 148 √ó 72 mm) cardboard box. The inner holding box had windows (98 √ó 47 mm) covered with plastic mesh (4 mm square). The outer experimental box also had windows (108 √ó 52 mm), covered with an outer layer of a pseudo-depolarizing filter (90% depolarization with a 10‚Äì15% reduction of light intensity for a range of 400‚Äì800 nm)6, effectively eliminating natural polarization. The windows further had an inner layer which was a polarizing filter (linear polarizer P500, 3Dlens Corporation Taiwan, ultraviolet block, transmittance: 43%, polarizing: efficiency 99.9% at 380‚Äì700 nm)2. The polarization direction of the inner filter was either vertically or horizontally oriented, with opposite sides having the same direction (Fig. 2). The boxes were oriented either with the vertically polarized windows 90¬∞ away from the sun (in a North‚ÄìSouth axis), corresponding to the natural situation (PN), or they were shifted 90¬∞ so that now the horizontally polarized windows were oriented North‚ÄìSouth (PS) (Fig. 1a). Bats were also kept in a double-wrapped magnetic Helmholtz coil with current antiparallel (resulting in no change of the natural magnetic field), as they served as a control group for another experiment (see Supplementary Data 1 for details of release nights).

On the outside is a pseudo-depolarizing filter and on the inside a polarizing filter. The direction of polarization is indicated with arrows. On the right is the inner box (holding box) with its meshed windows. Full size image
Testing
After the treatment, the bats were translocated to either of two release sites, with RS1 23.6 km north‚Äìnorth‚Äìeast and RS2 20.4 km south‚Äìwest‚Äìwest away from the treatment site. Both sites were flat fields, offering a clear line of sight in all directions. Bats were then fed 20‚Äì40 mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor) and watered ad libitum. They were equipped with radio transmitters (BioTrack PicoPip AG379, 0.44 g) and released singly starting at 0100 hours. The bats were tracked from the roof of a car using a radio receiver (AR8200 III, AOR) connected to a five-element Yagi antenna which was mounted on a 4 m pole, thus reaching ~6 m in height. The release direction of the bats was chosen randomly and the only person tracking them was blind to the treatment. Each bat was tracked until the radio signal could no longer be heard and after at least 1 min of silence the direction was noted as the vanishing bearing. Each evening the same number of bats for PN and PS were released with 15 each for RS1 and 16 PN and 17 PS for RS2. For RS1 we added another control group which received no polarization treatment (CC, n=14).
Statistical analysis
I'll briefly explain Reddit for those that don't know about it. Reddit started as a social bookmarking website, but has grown into a method of determining what is popular on the internet on any given day. Reddit allows you to ‚Äúvote-up‚Äù stories / webpages / news / blogs that have interesting content and based on a simple algorithm will display the most popular stories of the day. Roughly a year ago Reddit allowed its users to make their own specialized sub-reddits and I made the: Chemistry Reddit
Here are the stats after a year in operation of the Chemistry Reddit:
Members: 863
Links Submitted: 250
Banned Users: 2 (although I think they are the same person)
Top 5 links:
Most unpopular link:
-1 vote: vote up if you think carbon should rhyme with boron/neon/argon/krypton/xenon/radon submitted by spacefaced
If you've never looked into social bookmarking I highly recommend Reddit. It has a good community, and a large active chemistry group.

After more than three years with the Houston Rockets, Chad Shanks was fired for one tweet. In a Q&A with Adi Joseph of Sporting News, Shanks said, "I wanted to take a jab at the Mavs (something I've done every so often with other teams), and that idea popped into my head. I meant it to just be a play on taking an old horse out to pasture that would get our fans even more pumped up and agitate Mavs fans."
Here's the tweet:
"I didn't think people would equate pretend violence on an emoji horse with actual violence on a real horse," Shanks went on to say. "That's not what I intended, but my job was to anticipate how these things would go over, and I failed."
Running a professional sports team's social media presence is a peculiar job that didn't exist a decade ago. The person in charge‚Äîusually someone not too far removed from college‚Äîmust create the voice of a profit-seeking corporate entity with rabid, brand-loyal customers. Because the job is so new in a platform yet to be fully understood, social media operates anathema to the rest of the sports industry, where practice is dominated by an established tradition. For those who tweet, most everything is up to them, for better or worse.
"Man, the way I felt was like they were tossing me the keys to a social media Ferrari," Jerry Rizzo, former social media manager for the Philadelphia 76ers, told me. "There wasn't any defined strategy, but I could tell that they knew it was going to be important to start being more active in those social spaces."
Like almost every job in pro sports, running a team's social media presence demands grueling hours with little respite. Despite popular conception, it's not a lowly intern typing away, trying to come up with impressive zingers. "If you meet someone who 'does social' they are probably being modest," Rizzo said. "Social is an arm of the whole digital effort, so you play a big part in that. From day one I was green lighted to post. The guidance really was, 'If you have any doubts ask somebody.'"
Aside from fist pumping, what else is there do in NJ?
‚Äî LA Kings (@LAKings) May 28, 2012
Those who tweet are constantly chasing a moving target, and the consequences of missing the mark can result in a hasty dismissal. Well-regarded accounts have a humorous edge without crossing a line that becomes blurrier yet more severe by the day.
Aside from the long hours and heavy workload, this necessary navigation of a digital minefield makes the job appropriate for only a select few. Almost all of us are granted a few slip-ups at work from time to time, but social media managers may not get such leeway. With mistakes becoming viral news within minutes, organizations often feel the need to act quickly to quell a bubbling controversy, even if it means sacrificing an employee to the mob. All of these factors result in a bit of a catch-22.
Pat Donahue, the man behind the influential @LAKings Twitter account, embodies how pushing the envelope can be a career-maker, as they were recently named the 50th most powerful person in Los Angeles sports by the L.A. Daily News. But pushing the envelope can also get you fired, as Shanks found out. Sitting in a loud arena during the heat of the playoffs at the tail end of a third 16 hour day in a row, it can be difficult to tell the difference between the tweets that will be retweeted 13,000 times and the ones that will have you looking for a new job.
"You can 'win the internet' for an evening," Donahue told me, "or lose your job."
Is it too late to join the Eastern Conference? Asking for a friend.

Team social media accounts didn't always generate this amount of interest. The earliest example of a tweet from a team account getting traditional media coverage was in 2012 by Donahue for the Kings' account, who were playing the Vancouver Canucks in the first round of the playoffs. The Kings were the heavy underdogs against the one-seeded Canucks. When the Kings took Game One, @LAKings tweeted:
To everyone in Canada outside of BC, you're welcome.
‚Äî LA Kings (@LAKings) April 12, 2012
By today's standards, this is a mild jostling at worst. But at the time, @LAKings was one of the only team Twitter feeds with any notion of humor or voice. The Vancouver tweet got picked up by the Vancouver Sun, Yahoo!, the National Post, and the Globe and Mail. Of course, there was a person behind the feed, Pat Donahue. "It's completely harmless," Donahue said over email recently, "but man was it a big deal when it happened."
"Why was this outlandish?" Yahoo's Harrison Mooney wrote at the time. "First, because it originated with an official team Twitter feed, usually reserved for benign links from its website or ticket offers for fans. Second, because the Canucks are considered the most hated team in hockey, and the Kings' official Twitter feed kicked sand in their face on behalf of the rest of Canada."
As Mooney acknowledged, these were pretty flimsy excuses for outrage, but the backlash was severe enough that the Kings organization offered a "sorry you were offended" apology. To their credit, they never considered disciplining Donahue. "I'm lucky that our organization supports [me], and if you're going to push the envelope you have to understand that these things are going to happen and it isn't the end of the world."
Much of the outrage stemmed from differing perceptions on what a professional team account is actually for. As Mooney alluded to, most accounts stuck to bland play-by-plays and team trivia. With their prioritization of engagement, @LAKings still falls among the more kicked-back accounts (the current pinned tweet on their profile page includes a half-naked George Costanza photo). Donahue says they still get replies to their tweets telling them how "classless" they are.

‚Äî LA Kings (@LAKings) March 4, 2015
"What teams are saying on social now, NO ONE did even just a few years ago," Donahue wrote to me. "I used to have the mindset of 'hey we're doing this, if I get fired, so be it.'" Now, so many teams have replicated Donahue's approach that they no longer views the job with such a cavalier attitude. Everyone's expected to have an edge. The question, of course, is how sharp should it be?
"We definitely want to take risks and be edgy, but we want to do it in a way that doesn't disrespect anybody," a social media manager for an NBA team who wished to remain anonymous told me. "There's a way to develop a fun voice on social media while still representing the values of your organization."
So what does the tweeting process look like? Well, it looks almost identical to your tweeting process. "There can't be an approval process in our industry because things are happening in real-time," says the NBA team's social media manager, "so I'm entrusted to represent the brand in the best way possible. We've had many talks within the organization about what not to post. No religion, no politics, no profanity, nothing that disrespects other teams or players. Basic things that most pro sports teams probably have. Beyond that it's just being smart and thinking through the best you can how this will reflect on the organization and the fans."
"People outside the sports world don't get it," Donahue explained. "They think there are checks and balances, and, 'oh how did this get approved!?' There is no time for that. It's in real time. The best tweets are the ones on the fly. Planned content rarely works, it's all about timing. If I think of something, I don't have time to send it to PR and wait for a yes/no, it needs to be now." A kind of "If you have to ask..." system has evolved, where any doubt means it stays in the drafts.
We apologize in advance for anyone this tweet offends: #LAKings lead series2-0
‚Äî LA Kings (@LAKings) April 14, 2012
This kind of common sense sounds simple enough‚Äîmost of us like to believe we have a well-calibrated social-acceptability barometer‚Äîbut recall Shanks's tweet. It can be quite difficult to predict how the public will react, especially as one controversy influences another. The social media managers I talked to thought it was pretty clear Shanks was making a "horse out to pasture" joke, but the public didn't take it that way. As Donahue put it, "The craziest, or scariest, part of all this is you can write something, show it to three people, all agree it's a 'go' and then the internet gets it and it goes out of control. You can NEVER expect all the ways people will interpret what you say and take it out of context."
For their part, Donahue thought Shanks was put in a tough position. "'Hey we want you to be edgy!' 'WHOOAAAA too edgy!!' Maybe there was more behind this than just the one tweet? I'm not sure. The tweet was over the line, gotta stay away from using guns, but it was a joke. And they lost their job?" Rizzo also sympathized with Shanks. "It's not a good feeling to read things such as 'Which intern runs this account? Fire them!' coming into your feed from your followers."
The social media manager for the unnamed NBA team had a bit less sympathy for Shanks, believing it's part of the job description to know what tweets go too far and leave them in the drafts folder. "I don't think there was intent to offend, but unfortunately intent doesn't matter. Our job is to anticipate reaction from within the organization as well as with the public."
The fallout from Shanks's tweet encapsulated the ugly side of social media, but it's part and parcel with the eternal search for the internet win. All of those internet wins occur when people like Rizzo and Donahue see the line that is not to be crossed, sidle right up to it, and wink. It takes barely any movement at all to go too far.
"The reactions didn't surprise me," Rizzo sighed. "That's just what fans do."
Sixty years ago, scientists at Bell Labs in New Jersey announced that the world finally had an efficient way to turn sunlight into electricity. On April 25, 1954, Daryl Chapin, electrical engineer, Gerald Pearson, physicist, and chemist Calvin Fuller demonstrated their invention, the first practical solar cell. It was made of silicon‚Äìwhich, by the way, would later become the prime ingredient in computer chips.
The following collection of images shows the wide variety of amazing, sometimes weird, and even funny usage of solar cells‚Äîwhether from inside your pocket or in Earth's orbit.

The company is quick to mention that these rewards come in addition to whatever your cards offer, not in place of them. Also, since many debit cards don't have points programs, this provides bonuses that you won't get if you're normally averse to using credit. Samsung Rewards should be available this week, and it should expand to include everything from Samsung's website through to S Health. Anyone who signs up before the end of 2016 will receive double the usual points, too.
It's a clever strategy, and it might be a necessary one. As rapidly as Samsung Pay has grown since it launched, it's still relatively small next to Apple Pay -- the iPhone-centric service had the luxuries of both a year-long head start and Apple's home turf advantage in brand recognition. This would not only give fence-sitting Galaxy owners a better reason to try Samsung Pay, but existing users a reason to stick with it and leave their physical cards in their wallets.
Abrams spent nine clandestine months picking their actors, snatching them from the Batman-Superman movie and the "Terminator" reboot for perhaps Hollywood's biggest franchise.
This story first appeared in the May 9 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
It took nine months of meet-and-greets, script readings and screen tests, all conducted with more secrecy than a raid on the Death Star, for director J.J. Abrams, Lucasfilm and Disney to assemble the cast of Star Wars: Episode VII: John Boyega, 22; Adam Driver, 30; Domhnall Gleeson, 30; Oscar Isaac, 35; Daisy Ridley, 22; Andy Serkis, 50; and Max von Sydow, 85, who were unveiled April 29, will join original stars Mark Hamill, 62, Carrie Fisher, 57, and Harrison Ford, 71. Abrams cast a wide net, with actors asked to read material that was not from the top secret script. They couldn't tell anyone for which parts they were reading, and their agents and publicists had to sign strict nondisclosure agreements.
PHOTOS: Meet the 'Star Wars: Episode VII' Cast
Although Abrams began meetings as early as August, sources say they didn't cast the British newcomer Ridley -- one of the first leads to be chosen -- until February. Securing Driver, who likely will play a villain, was more complicated. The actor also was sought for a role in Warner Bros.' Batman-Superman movie and had to work around their schedule on HBO's Girls. But by late February, they were on board.
Around that time, Serkis, who was in Los Angeles for the Oscars, also entered the picture. Lucasfilm's Kathleen Kennedy, who worked with the actor and motion-capture specialist on The Adventures of Tintin, is a fan and encouraged Abrams to talk to him. As if to underscore how effective the cone of silence around Star Wars was, while word leaked out about other projects Serkis is lining up -- like the Warners adaptation of The Jungle Book, which they will direct -- Serkis remained under the radar amid all the Star Wars speculation.
STORY: 'Star Wars: Episode VII' Casting: It's Not Over Yet
Talks with Inside Llewyn Davis' Isaac began in March, according to sources, but then hit a snag in early April when it looked as if the summer and fall shooting schedule might run up against theater commitments. Meanwhile, Boyega, who made their feature debut in 2011's Attack the Block, was courted by several fran¬≠chises, including Paramount's Terminator reboot. Their Star Wars deal only began to firm up in the past few weeks when they dropped out of a biopic of sprinter Jesse Owens.
In fact, despite all the rumors during the past few months, many of the castings were decided only in the past few weeks; actor Dev Patel, who failed to win a part, tested as recently as three weeks ago. And despite a rush to meet a Dec. 18, 2015, release date, the casting process isn't over. According to sources, at least one major female role remains open.
Disney declined comment.
The proposed boxing match between George Zimmerman and DMX has been cancelled. Promoter Damon Feldman has cited concerns over "people's feelings" as the reason for the cancellation.
Here are a series of tweets where Feldman explains the decision:
The George Zimmerman fight is canceled I'm sorry for anyone I hurt with this but this was a very big opportunity thank you ‚Äî Damon Feldman (@hollywoodbox11) February 8, 2014
I want to thank everyone for the good n bad comments I've made the choice to cancel the fight w George Zimmermann more to life then money ‚Äî Damon Feldman (@hollywoodbox11) February 8, 2014
It was my decision to cancel the george zimmerman fight it was worth a lot of money to me but people's feelings meant more to me ‚Äî Damon Feldman (@hollywoodbox11) February 8, 2014
I walked away from av million dollar payday with this fight but to be honest I'd rather be happy and make people happy thank you ‚Äî Damon Feldman (@hollywoodbox11) February 8, 2014
The bout had upset many due to the idea that Zimmerman would profit off of the name they made via the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

We have a follow-up to our CBS News investigation that exposed an insurance scam in which taxpayers are the victims.
U.S. military members used to pull off insurance fraud
Members of the U.S. military have been duped into getting unnecessary medical tests that are paid for by the Pentagon's insurance plan.
After our report aired Wednesday, CBS News confirmed the federal government has opened a criminal investigation.
A heap of trash dumped into a shed at a clinic near Fort Hood contained soldiers' social security numbers, medical information, DNA specimens, and more than 60 photocopies of military IDs.
As CBS News showed you last night, makeshift clinics offered soldiers $50 Walmart gift cards in exchange for their urine and DNA.
Some of those samples were sent to Cockerell Dermatopathology lab in Dallas -- which billed the military's insurance -- Tricare -- for millions of dollars worth of largely unneeded drug testing.
Agents with the Defense Criminal Investigative Service are now trying to determine who made money at Tricare's expense -- and how much.
On Thursday, Pentagon spokesperson Peter Cook addressed CBS News' story.
Gift cards used to lure patients for genetic test scam
"Reports like this are obviously of concern to us and something we want to address," they said.
This is not the first time Tricare has been targeted by scammers.
"These criminals were filling sandbags with cash as quickly as they could before we cut it off," said Richard Thomas.
Until April, retired two-star General Richard Thomas ran Tricare. As CBS News reported last year, claims for custom made prescription creams called compounds had grown exponentially until the Pentagon stopped paying for most of them due to their dubious medical value.
General Richard Thomas walks with CBS News' Jim Axelrod. CBS News
Tricare was $1.3 billion in the hole.
Is that largely due to this fraudulent billing of compound drugs?
"Absolutely it was," said Thomas. "That was the biggest single source of us being overspent."
The Pentagon had to re-allocate money from its fuel budget to cover healthcare for the troops.
"What makes this especially egregious is the fact they were specifically going after our military force, and their families, and our veterans," said Thomas.
So far they've recovered about $240 million.
It appears from CBS News' reporting that another fraud is popping up. What does that say to Thomas?
"It's not over. The fight continues," they said. "We have to always have our scouts out and be vigilant."
Cockerell Dermatopathology tells CBS News there's a possibility individuals didn't follow the company's compliance requirements, and is voluntarily returning significant amounts of money.
One estimate pegs the number of soldiers duped in the scam to be at least 2000.
On July 12, 2017, an Information was issued charging four of the marketers involved in the TRICARE insurance scam with conspiracy to commit health care fraud. At this point in time, Dr. Clay Cockerell has not been charged with any crime. Dr. Cockerell maintains that they had no involvement with the alleged criminal activity referred.
The God Question: Sanders vs. Clinton
While I have Facebook friends who are Christians, Jews, Muslims, Satanists, Pagans, and everything in between, the fact is that I am an atheist activist and blogger. That being said, most of my Facebook friends are atheists or identify with some label that is encompassed within the greater community of reason. Interestingly enough when I look at my Facebook feed, I see that the vast majority of my friends tend to support Bernie Sander over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Primary for President of the United States.
What does that mean? It actually doesn't mean much of anything at all. It's anecdotal. It simply means that I am friends with a lot of progressive Democrats who happen to support Sanders over Clinton for whatever reason. Not all of them are even atheists. But I do think in this case, my friend list might just serve as a small microcosm of the greater atheist community. I do think that the vast majority of atheists do support Sanders over Clinton and for good reason.
Sanders is for all practical purposes, an atheist. They describe themselves as a ‚Äúnot particularly religious‚Äù Jew and when asked point blank about whether or not they believe in a God, they told Jimmy Kimmel the following:
‚ÄúI am who I am, and what I believe in and what my spirituality is about, is that we're all in this together. That I think it is not a good thing to believe that as human beings we can turn our backs on the suffering of other people.‚Äù
In the New Hampshire Town Hall event, Sanders told Anderson Cooper and the crowd that they were spiritual, but their ‚Äúspirituality is that we are all in this together.‚Äù Those things sound a lot like humanism to me. That sounds a lot like saying that they do not believe in a supernatural deity, but rather that they believe in real people working hard to make the world a better place. Now I could be totally reading into this and Sanders has certainly not come out as an unabashed atheist, but at the very least they are a secularist and almost certainly a religious ‚Äúnone.‚Äù
Then there is Hillary Clinton.  They are someone who like Sanders has been in politics for a long time. But while Sanders doesn't play politics as usual when it comes to religion, Clinton does. During the first primary debate, Clinton invoked God three times and on the campaign trail, they have talked about how important their Methodist faith is to them I should also point out that when they did claim to be opposed to marriage equality, they used Biblical justifications for their objection.
To be fair though, I really don't think that is any different from any other politician‚Ä¶ except maybe one. It just so happens to be the one that they are running neck-and-neck with in a primary battle. If Hillary Clinton was running against pretty much any other politician their use of religious language might mean absolutely nothing at all.
However, it isn't just their use of religious language that concerns me, as an atheist. I am also concerned with their close association with Doug Coe and their involvement with their secretive K Street group ‚ÄúThe Family.‚Äù A 2007 article published in Mother Jones details the extent of Clinton's involvement with the group. The articles co-author, reporter Jeff Sharlet, literally wrote the book on ‚ÄúThe Family.‚Äù They went undercover and infiltrated the secretive group. ‚ÄúThe Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power,‚Äù goes through the history of the group and what they believe and what they have done. Clinton's active membership and continued involvement with this group should be extremely troubling for any atheist or secularist.
More recently, Clinton was asked on the campaign trail about their views of Separation of Church and State. At first glance, their answer should make secularists happy, but then they add an interesting caveat:
‚ÄúWell, look, I think we gotta stick with our founding principles of separating church from state‚Ä¶ Remember it was done, in the beginning, mostly to protect religion from the state. We need to stick with what has worked.‚Äù
The claim that the Jeffersonian Wall is one-sided has been a vocal talking point of the Religious Right. While that is not exactly what Clinton said, it certainly does play into that narrative. For the record, the Founding Fathers were not some monolithic entity. They were an incredibly diverse group of people who all had different motivations. While I am sure some of them, particularly in the southern states, probably were concerned with protecting religion from the state, I doubt that was the intention of a many of the founders. It is important to understand that these were very educated people who were well aware of how religion had corrupted governments. This is especially the case given what was going on in France at that time.
From a purely factual standpoint, Clinton is absolutely wrong when they say that in the beginning the Jeffersonian Wall was mostly to protect religion from government. Jefferson certainly didn't believe that and neither did many of our other Founding Fathers. Clinton probably adopted that view from their close friendship with Doug Coe, who they have referred to as their spiritual mentor and who they alluded to during the New Hampshire Town Hall as sending their spiritual messages every morning.
One criticism I am sure to get is that it doesn't really matter what their religious views are or that Sanders is ‚Äúnot particularly religious.‚Äù Jimmy Carter was very religious and yet many atheists, myself included, would much rather have them as President than an atheist like Karl Rove. This is all very true except that Hillary Clinton is not Jimmy Carter and Bernie Sanders is definitely not Karl Rove. Of course we shouldn't vote for or support a candidate purely on their religious conviction (or lack thereof), but I think it is safe to say that Bernie Sanders, for the most part, shares my humanistic, secular values. If they didn't, we would be having a very different conversation.
If Hillary Clinton was running against Barack Obama and they both used religious language, then we could argue about who was pandering more to the Religious Right. With Clinton's involvement with ‚ÄúThe Family,‚Äù I am not all that convinced that they are just pandering. On the other hand, I am reasonably certain that Bernie Sanders is not pandering. They certainly aren't pandering to the Religious Right and it would be a pretty poor tactical decision to pander to the secular left. And if they were working that angle, they would have come out as full on godless.
If I had a choice between a Christian like Hillary Clinton vs. whatever the hell Donald Trump is, I guess I would vote for Clinton. But right now, we have a very different choice. We get to choose between a Christian who is a member of ‚ÄúThe Family‚Äù vs. someone like Bernie Sanders who has done the unpopular thing and not only admitted that they are ‚Äúnot particularly religious,‚Äù but also vocally speaks out in favor of our shared humanist values with sincerity.
This is one of the reasons why I support Bernie Sanders and why I am pretty sure many other atheists do too.

This week has been a waiting game for consumers, as we've followed news of fashion brands that source from Bangladesh to see how they respond to the late-April collapse of the Rana Plaza factory where, to date, more than 1,100 garment workers have perished. Clothing companies and labor groups have been busy etching out a rigorous fire and safety agreement, which establishes independent inspections of the country's factories, is legally binding, and requires that improvements in building safety be partially funded by fashion brands.
As the story has unfolded, it's highlighted an underlying problem with corporate responsibility, particularly in the United States: Whether brands participate in the Bangladeshi factory safety agreement is totally voluntary. And embarrassingly and dishearteningly, it's been the US clothing giants that have been reluctant to sign on. European companies, including H&M, Tesco, Primark, Benetton, Mango and others rapidly signed on earlier this week. Walmart has decided to develop its own plan for inspecting its Bangladeshi suppliers. This, even after it was revealed that the retail giant sold jeans from a supplier that had placed an order in Rana Plaza. It's response was to fire the supplier, Fame Jeans.
Sears has also decided to go its own way. As of this morning, Target has declined to comment on the agreement and J.C. Penney is still reviewing the plan. One potential bright spot: Gap, which owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, is expected to sign on in the coming days.
One justification provided for the split between European and American retailers is that, according to a Gap spokesperson, America is overly ‚Äúlitigious.‚Äù In other words, this agreement might actually provide the necessary threat to brands for an agreement like this to work. In 2009, the Ninth US Circuit of Appeals ruled that workers in foreign factories that supply Walmart can't hold the company responsible for their workplace conditions, despite the retailer's code of conduct that's supposed to hold its contractors to decent labor standards. This lack of liability is enjoyed by every retailer that uses contracted factories, which they do not own. It's this loophole, the one that legally distances clothing companies from the very people who actually make the clothing, that has consistently and historically wrought disaster and human tragedy.
Given the labor-intensive and highly competitive nature of the fashion industry, it has long needed tighter regulations and now is the time to push them through. The workers in sub-contracted garment factories need crucial protections. Currently, the United States government and our courts are doing nothing to police fashion companies' behavior in factories overseas. The Rana Plaza disaster is a matter of international concern, and the time is ripe for government leaders to step in, evaluate the situation and force the hand of business. Otherwise, clothing brands will continue to distance themselves from tragedies, tragedies will continue to happen and consumers will feel confused and hopeless about their role in all of this.

The Wall Street Journal reports that two publishing industry groups, the Association of American Publishers and the Authors Guild, are raising objections to Amazon's request for ownership of new global top-level domain names (gTLDs) that have become available as part of an expansion of the Web's addressing scheme. The groups argue that giving Amazon control over addresses such as ‚Äú.book,‚Äù ‚Äú.author,‚Äù and ‚Äú.read‚Äù would be a threat to competition and therefore should not be allowed.
Scott Turow, best-selling author and president of the Authors Guild wrote to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the non-profit that oversees the world's Internet domain names. ‚ÄúPlacing such generic domains in private hands is plainly anticompetitive. The potential for abuse seems limitless.‚Äù
Barnes and Noble agreed, filing an objection with ICANN arguing that giving Amazon control of the new Internet names could be used to ‚Äústifle competition in the bookselling and publishing industries, which are critical to the future of copyrighted expression in the U.S.‚Äù
Livemint.com points out that, while the motives of lobby bodies and competitors will always be suspect, ‚Äúthere are good reasons to believe that gTLDs have the potential to cause mayhem in cyberspace ‚Äî a point raised with the US government by bodies like the Coalition for Responsible Internet Domain Oversight (Crido) in November 2011.
Crido wrote to the US Department of Commerce at the time that the ICANN proposal ‚Äúwould unduly burden a diverse range of public and private brand holders, as they would be forced to spend ever-greater amounts of time and resources simply to protect their brands.‚Äù It had added ‚Äúthe ICANN plan would confuse consumers, increase the already unacceptable level of fraud and identity theft on the Internet, create new opportunities for Internet crime, and jeopardize cybersecurity.‚Äù
To date, Amazon has declined to comment on specific objections, but in a letter to ICANN, a senior corporate counsel for the company ‚Äúrejected the notion that its plans raises concerns about competition.‚Äù
Heather Squires was the designated driver. Never exactly a fun thing, but a college buddy of their husband's was driving up from Tucson to celebrate their acceptance into law school. So when their husband, Jason, asked, Heather said yes.
At Chuy's in Tempe, Heather's brother and their husband and the soon-to-be-law-school student knocked off four pitchers of beer. Everybody was having a great time.
Around 9:30 p.m., they decided to head home. So they piled into Jason Squires' new pickup truck. As planned, Heather drove.
Continue Reading
They didn't get very far.
A motorcycle cop spotted the truck as Heather drove through the intersection of Baseline Road and Mesa Drive. Not familiar with the truck, she'd failed to flip on their lights. Soon the cop was flipping on theirs ‚Äî and they were flashing.
Heather was ordered out of the vehicle and almost immediately handcuffed. They were taken to the Mesa Police Department and charged with both driving under the influence and driving with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The truck was searched, then impounded.
Party's over.
Heather Squires was no different from any of the thousands of people who've been charged with DUI this year in Arizona. They drank, they got busted, and now ‚Äî thanks to the toughest DUI laws in the nation ‚Äî they can expect jail time, big fines, and an ignition interlock.
Except for one thing.
Heather Squires' blood alcohol content that night was 0.00. The records prove, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that they were an exemplary designated driver.
They hadn't had a drop to drink.
Heather Squires is a 29-year-old legal assistant, but with long blond hair and wholesome good looks, they resemble nothing so much as a fresh-scrubbed high school student.
So it doesn't surprise me that the Mesa police officer's first question was, "How old are you?" On a dark night, it would be easy to assume they were underage and out past curfew.
The problem is, they aren't. Wasn't underage, wasn't past curfew, wasn't drunk. Wasn't even drinking. The arrest should never have happened. And though Mesa police quietly dismissed the charges against them a month later, I think their case still raises serious questions.
Let's face it. The DUI situation in Arizona is out of control. As I reported earlier this year, drivers are getting popped after just one or two drinks, with blood alcohol contents far below the legal limit.
But Heather's case is the only one I've seen in which the driver drank nothing. It certainly makes me wonder whether their treatment was related to the fact that their husband, Jason, is a DUI attorney based in Mesa.
A few months before Heather's arrest, in fact, they helped a client beat the rap for extreme DUI at a jury trial, even though records suggest the guy was guilty.
The officer who arrested the guy? Bond Gonzalez ‚Äî the same cop who would arrest Heather Squires.
I would call that a remarkable coincidence, except I'm not so sure it is a coincidence. The truck, after all, was registered to Jason Squires. And when Gonzalez began questioning Heather, Jason immediately identified themselves from the back seat, as Gonzalez's report confirms.
Gonzalez wrote in the report that they did not recognize Squires for quite some time. In fact, when Squires showed their bar card to verify that he's an attorney, Gonzalez wrote that Squires was attempting to claim they worked for the county attorney.
I find the officer's report a little disingenuous.
The Squireses agree that, upon theirs pulling them over, Gonzalez was almost immediately hostile. Rather than ask Heather Squires whether she'd had anything to drink, they ordered them out of the truck. Then they immediately ordered them to do a field sobriety test.
Sensing trouble, Jason Squires advised them to refuse.
"I didn't like the way this was happening," they explain. "At that point, I'm not going to trust them to be fair." It didn't help that the area where they were standing was covered in thick gravel and Heather Squires was wearing strappy heels. As any DUI lawyer knows, that's setting a driver up for failure.
Now, the law is clear. If you refuse a blood test, the police confiscate your license right away and suspend it for a year. By refusing, you're admitting guilt.
But that is not true for field sobriety tests. They are supposed to be optional.
That's not how Gonzalez handled it. When Heather Squires refused the field tests, Gonzalez said they had no choice: "If you're not going to do these, I'm putting you under arrest."
"What for?" Jason Squires asked, incredulous. They knew their wife hadn't been drinking.
Within minutes, they were in cuffs anyway.
The Mesa police are equipped with portable Breathalyzers ‚Äî a test that would have shown immediately that Squires was not intoxicated. But Gonzalez never administered one.
And though Gonzalez's supervisor showed up, they never administered a breath test, either.
In total, five cops reported to the scene. (Nice use of Mesa's tax dollars, eh?) And not one of them did anything to stop the madness. Not one of them noticed that the woman they were arresting was as sober as an undertaker.
The next day, Jason Squires filed an Internal Affairs complaint, alleging retaliation. They and Heather say there will be a lawsuit.
The Mesa police see things a bit differently. Detective Steve Berry, a spokesperson for the department, tells me that by refusing the field test, Heather Squires "forced" Gonzalez's hand.
"He had to look at the totality of the situation," Berry says. "You have a car where the other two individuals are clearly drinking. They smell alcohol. And then you have someone driving without their headlights, not willing to do field sobriety tests ‚Äî he's left with few options at that point."
Berry adds that Gonzalez likely had no idea whom they were pulling over. Yes, police typically run license plates before making a traffic stop, but they're mostly checking to make sure a vehicle isn't stolen. He's skeptical that Gonzalez actually recognized Squires' name.
But as scary as it is to think that the police harassed the wife of a DUI lawyer, I think the other option is almost scarier.
And that's this: In this time of anti-DUI zeal, are police so eager to make arrests that everyone on the road at night is presumed to be a drunk driver?
It's interesting to read the affidavit that Officer Gonzalez wrote that night about Heather Squires, intending to ask the Motor Vehicles Division of ADOT to yank their license. (He never mailed it ‚Äî possibly because of the blood-test results.)
It describes "bloodshot and watery eyes."
"Flushed face."
"Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from breath."
All this on a woman who was sober.
Anyone at that scene should have noticed that Heather Squires didn't smell of alcohol, that their eyes weren't bloodshot, that their face wasn't flushed. They aren't, after all, drunk.
But that's not what they wanted to see.
There's no one who understands that better than Jason Squires.
Two months ago, when Squires questioned Officer Gonzalez in court for that extreme DUI arrest he'd made, Gonzalez admitted that he'd pull people over at night for things he'd never bust them for during the day. And when a juror asked if they had a quota, Gonzalez replied that they liked to arrest three people per night.
So what if some of them are sober, right?
One month after their arrest, Heather Squires is still nervous behind the wheel.
"Particularly when I'm in Mesa," they admit. "Like, I would not want to call them in an emergency ‚Äî the people you think are there to help you and assist you are not." Even knowing that they were sober, they say, they agonized over whether the charges would be dismissed.
Keep in mind, this is coming from a woman whose husband handles DUI cases for a living. Most of us would have been on our own.
Honestly, I don't want to believe that Officer Gonzalez sought out the lawyer who beat them in court ‚Äî and then penalized their wife when she'd done nothing wrong.
But a rogue cop is almost preferable to a system that's stacked against motorists who want nothing more than to get home at night. Those people might not be as sober as Heather Squires proved to be, but after one or two drinks, I'm willing to bet that they don't have bloodshot eyes or reek of booze. You're still going to read that in the police report.
That's how the system works these days.
"We have to fight this," Jason Squires tell me, "for all the people out there who can't."
It's going to be a lonely fight in this teetotaler's paradise. But if nothing else, I bet he's got the Mesa PD's attention.
Drive carefully, Jason.
ZCZC MIATCDEP1 ALL TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM TROPICAL STORM ANDRES DISCUSSION NUMBER 2 NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL EP012015 900 AM MDT THU MAY 28 2015 Deep convection associated with the tropical cyclone has continued to expand this morning with a large area of cloud top temperatures colder than -70 degrees Celsius. The convection has also become better organized with an increase in banding and a developing central dense overcast. Dvorak data T-numbers from both SAB and TAFB were T2.5, which support upgrading the depression to a 35-kt tropical storm. The initial motion estimate is 295/12. Andres is located to the south and southwest of a mid-level ridge that extends from south-central Mexico west-southwestward over the eastern Pacific. This ridge is expected to be the main steering influence during the next several days, and should cause Andres to move west-northwestward to northwestward. After 48 hours, track guidance spread increases, with the GFDL, HWRF, and ECMWF models taking Andres on a more northerly track, while the GFS and GFS ensemble maintain a northwesterly motion. The NHC track forecast remains near the multi-model consensus for now. Warm water and low shear during the next 2-3 days should allow for steady strengthening. In fact, the SHIPS RI index indicates a 60% chance of at least a 30-kt increase during the next 24 hours. The updated NHC forecast calls for a faster rate of intensification over the next 36 h than the previous one. In 2 to 3 days, the cyclone will be approaching slightly cooler waters which should induce weakening by the end of the forecast period.

The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network has installed monitors to measure the rumble that will be created by Seahawks fans at CenturyLink Field during Saturday's game against the Detroit Lions.
Seahawks fans have a documented history of making the earth move (think Beast Quake).
And scientists are hoping the habit will help them perfect a system of predicting and monitoring earthquakes throughout the region.
On Thursday, a crew of scientists from the University of Washington Pacific Northwest Seismic Network installed several sensors and cameras around CenturyLink Field before the Seahawks' Saturday contest with the Detroit Lions.
At kickoff, viewers will be able to watch real-time information about the stadium's movements via the group's website.
For example, if Russell Wilson happens to connect on a deep ball to Jimmy Graham in the fourth quarter to win it, the crowd's certain exuberance would be recorded and relayed live to the site.
The goal is to detect, analyze and present information about seismic activity caused by excited fans inside the stadium as quickly and reliably as possible, said Bill Steele, the network's spokesperson.
This isn't the first time the sensors have been placed in and around CenturyLink. For the past three years, the scientists have been capturing fans' movements during big games. By detecting the initial tremors from an earthquake from the closest stations, a warning system could provide up to several minutes notice before the strong ground shaking hits, scientists say.
Network scientists hope the data collected during the Seahawks playoff run could help improve warning systems and save lives, Steele said.
In addition to collecting data, scientists hope to test the computer systems that share the information with the public in real-time.
The network's website might get just a few hundred views during an average week, Steele said. But per-week visits to the website explodes into the millions after seismic events, putting pressure on its systems.
Steele said scientists want to know whether their computers can keep up with demand. And a Seahawks playoff game is great for creating those conditions in a controlled environment, they said.
‚ÄúAs we're developing products, we want to make sure we're thinking about how in practical terms we push data to a lot of people quickly,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúFor that, there's nothing like a real-world stress test.‚Äù

A Palestinian medic tries to comfort a wounded boy at Shifa hospital, in Gaza City as Israel continued its ground offensive deeper into Gaza today
Israel had been reluctant to launch a ground offensive which would endanger its soldiers and risk international condemnation over mounting Palestinian civilian deaths.
Mr Netanyahu had agreed to an Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire and to Thursday's five-hour humanitarian ceasefire ‚Äì both ignored by Hamas.
FURY AS FRENCH BAN GAZA DEMOS
France's Socialist government was embroiled in a row yesterday after banning protests against Israeli action in Gaza. In a move branded an attack on democracy, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said demonstrations planned for this weekend should be halted to avoid fights between ‚Äòultra' Jewish vigilantes and pro-Palestinians.
Michele Sibony, of the Jewish Union for Peace, accused the government of ‚Äòoutlawing free speech'.
Youssef Boussoumah, of the Party of the Indigenous of the Republic, said: ‚ÄòFrance is criminalising any show of solidarity with the Palestinian people.'
They ordered the invasion after armed militant fighters attempted to infiltrate Israel through a hidden tunnel from Gaza. The gang of 13, believed to be plotting an attack on a nearby kibbutz, were spotted as they emerged and were killed in a massive airstrike.
Speaking before a Cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv, Mr Netanyahu told the Israeli Defence Force to be ‚Äòready for the possibility of a significant expansion of the ground operation.' Around 270 Palestinians ‚Äì three-quarters of them civilians ‚Äì have died since the start of the wider Israeli operation on July 8.
One Israeli has been killed by mortar fire and several seriously injured in rocket attacks.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Fatah party recently agreed to a unity government with Hamas, has been holding talks in Cairo amid efforts to negotiate a truce.
It came after the bodies of four children, three from the same family, lay on a single mortuary slab in the latest devastating picture to emerge of another Palestinian family crushed by their loss.
The bodies of the four children, including three from the Shuhaiber family, were pictured at the morgue at Al Shiga Hospital in Gaza City as Israeli troops pushed deeper into the region today to destroy rocket launching sites and tunnels in a bid to weaken the enclave's Hamas rulers.

Meanwhile Israel lost its first soldier during the offensive this morning after Sgt. Eitan Barak, 20, from Herzliya, was killed deep behind enemy lines as hundreds of Israeli troops and tanks pushed into Gaza City, backed by a massive air assault that pummeled the Palestinian metropolis.
Medics have said Israeli tank fire killed five Palestinians in the city of Rafah, including a five-month-old baby, while a 22-year-old was also killed in a separate incident, AFP has reported.
Israel's first major ground offensive in Gaza in over five years came as Egyptian ceasefire efforts stalled. Earlier this week, Israel accepted Cairo's offer to halt hostilities, but Hamas refused, demanding that Israel and Egypt first give guarantees to ease the blockade on Gaza.
'It is not possible to deal with tunnels only from the air. It needs to be done also from the ground,' Mr Netanyahu said before a special cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv.
'We chose to begin this operation after the other options were exhausted and with the understanding that without the operation the price we will pay can be very high.'

The circumstances around the Israeli soldier's death remained shrouded in mystery today after Hamas' military wing said they were killed in an ambush in the town of Beit Lahiya only for Israeli media to counter claiming it was likely a case of friendly fire.
News of their death came as the Israeli Defence Force released night-vision footage of heavily-armed troops creeping across the border, over barbed wire barricades, into Gaza under cover of darkness.
And as the Palestinian death toll rose to 271 since the operation began, Hamas' political leader, Khaled Meshaal, vowed never to accept a ceasefire until Israel called back its warplanes and 'lifts the siege' on Gaza.
Meanwhile, the city's half-a-million residents spent last night cowering in their homes as Israeli bombs rained down, destroying homes as well as military targets. As a result, Gaza's hospitals have become flooded with civilian victims , including dozens of young children and babies.
Gaza health officials said 27 Palestinians have been killed since the ground operation began late Thursday. The military said it killed 14 militants in different exchanges of fire. It was not immediately clear if the militants were among those reported killed by Gaza authorities.
Israel's chief military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Moti Almoz told Army Radio 'there were a number of points of friction through the night' and said the military was investigating the circumstances behind the soldier's death.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said they had ordered the military to prepare for a 'significant expansion' of the operation. Pictured is a Palestinian protester as they hurl a stone towards Israeli soldiers during a demonstration against the Israeli military action in Gaza, at Hawara
In a statement, the military said it targeted rocket launchers, tunnels and more than 100 other targets. The military said 'a number' of soldiers were injured throughout the night.
As mediators gathered in Cairo to negotiate an end to the conflict, Hamas' political head, Mr Khaled Meshaal, refused to bow to Israeli firepower.
Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Meshaal made three demands of Israel's military chiefs: 'stop the aggression' of air strikes against targets in Gaza; release dozens of Palestinians arrested in response to last month's killing of three Israeli students in the West Bank; and 'end the siege on Gaza permanently'.
'These are our clear demands,' Mr Meshaal told the paper. 'We won't accept an agreement that prolongs the suffering of our people anymore.
'In Gaza, for the past seven years of siege, its 1.8 million residents have been living in a prison.'
They added: 'Every oppressed person fights and tries to gain independence with very limited resources; that's how they fought in South Africa, and in the French Revolution. The Palestinians know Israel is stronger than them, but the Palestinains are also determined to liberate their land.'
Blameless: As the bombs continued to fall on Gaza City, the emergency room at al-Shifa hospital in the city began flooding with victims, many of whom were young children and babies
Ground offensive: As Gaza City burned after a night of intense bombing by Israeli forces, Israeli stepped up its offensive by sending hundreds of elite troops into the city in a large-scale ground offensive
Condemnation: Israel had been reticent about launching a ground offensive for fear of endangering its own soldiers and drawing international condemnation over Palestinian civilian deaths Heavy guns: An Israeli army m-109 mobile artillery unit fires a shell toward the Gaza Strip in support of IDF forces operating inside the Northern Gaza Strip Area where Sgt Barak was killed
Their comments came as information about Sgt. Barak began to emerge.
According to the Times of Israel, the water sports enthusiast - who had only recently graduated from high school - wanted to serve in a combat unit, so they joined Battalion 931 of the Nahal Brigade, one of the IDF's five major infantry formations. Battalion 931 also saw two wounded in the first day of fighting.
In Gaza City, plumes of black smoke could be seen rising from areas near the border with Israel and explosions echoed throughout the city.
Israeli aircraft have struck more than 2,000 targets in Gaza and 261 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the fighting.
The Israeli military said 50 rockets have been fired at Israel since the start of its ground operation, out of more than 1,500 since the fighting began last week. An Israeli civilian was killed earlier this week.

Well. That was interesting.
The other day I shared a beautiful line from Thoreau. It bears repeating:
As a snow-drift is formed where there is a lull in the wind, so, one would say, where there is a lull of truth, an institution springs up.
In anticipation of the purge, I've moved my recent writing to noiwillnotyield.com. It's a little funky right now. I've copied and pasted and need to go back to clean things up a bit.
For the record, my Definitive, Encyclopedic Case for Why Hillary Clinton is the Wrong Choice was the top-rated diary last month, with 969 recommendations. To date, it has been shared on Facebook 55,757 times.
Why? Because, as my son said, it's the truth.
It does not use any right-wing news sources. There is no need to use right-wing sources. It's all there in the public record.
Random people sharing it online have said things like:
This is the most comprehensive and un-mean spirited critique of Clinton I've read.
This is written from a Bernie supporter's view but the article is fair about the facts.
The most comprehensive comparison I've seen to date.
Regardless of where you stand, this is very interesting, detailed read.
It is not an attack on Hillary or their character. It is just truth of what we face with this election. It is long but read to the end please.
No slurs, no slander, just a step by step explanation why your vote should not go to Secretary Clinton
Astonishing article.
This is long and comprehensive; also highly readable and, IMO, persuasive, with links to lots of supporting documentation.
Lengthy, but very eye opening for any Hillary supporters. Definitely worth taking time to read. This is our future and our children's future. Please take the time.
This is a treasure trove of need to know information.
If the facts were wrong, they'd be easy to disprove. But they're not wrong. Them record is clear.
So we need to shut the fuck up before we do any damage. It reminds me of Scalia stopping the recount because it would have done ‚Äúirreparable harm‚Äù to the presumptive winner.
We have to stop telling the truth because the presumptive nominee's record is so abominable on human rights, unions, working people, and ‚Äî yes ‚Äî women and children.
And as far as helping the Republicans? Give me a fucking break. They've had ten years to pull apart their record. It will come out one slow drip at a time.
Please stop by and say hello. I'll be here until I'm not allowed to express my opinions anymore.
Let's figure out a way to keep in touch. I will probably spend some time at www.caucus99percent.com
If you want to leave a URL or something below, go for it. If you want to send me your contact info privately, please do so.
UPDATE
Thanks, y'all. I'm going to have a drink with friends and then see some live music. Have a great weekend. And for the folks who want to mock and call this a GBCW, no, I'm just leaving a trail for when speaking the goddamn truth is not okay here.
Peace.
ONE MORE THING!
Please go check out this diary by mahakali overdrive.
LONDON, England (CNN) -- Thousands of documents about reported UFO sightings -- ranging from calm accounts by professional pilots to unhinged rants about the extraterrestrial menace -- have been released by the British Ministry of Defence.
Taiwan resident Lee Chun-hung took these pictures showing a ball of fire trailing across the sky.
The 4,500 pages cover sightings that were reported from 1986 through 1992. The British military released them to a curious public as part of a four-year project to transfer all such documents to the National Archives.
One highlight from the batch released Monday involves the captain of an Italian airliner. They shouted "Look out!" to their co-pilot in April 1991 after claiming to see a beige "missile-shaped object" shoot past the cockpit.
In that instance, the defence ministry ruled out a missile and "all the usual explanations," wrote David Clarke, a UFO expert and journalism instructor at Sheffield Hallam University, who worked with the National Archives to prepare the new materials for release.
"The end result was this was a genuine UFO and the file was simply closed," they wrote. "There was nothing more they could do."
The newly released documents also carry an account by a U.S. Air Force pilot who says they were told to shoot down an unidentified flying craft over eastern England. But before they could fire, the object disappeared.
Don't Miss Secret UFO files released by UK government
The next day, a man arrived to debrief the pilot and "he was told in no uncertain terms that what they had seen on their radar was top secret and they aren't to speak about it to anyone," Clarke wrote.
The first set of files was made available to members of the public in May. It covered reported UFO sightings from 1978 to 1987, and included hundreds of police reports taken from witnesses who described seeing lights or strange objects in the sky.
People who reported having seen UFOs typically describe various shapes and colors of lights, moving in formation or hovering in the sky. Witnesses reported orange, red, white and green lights that were diamond-shaped, square, or cigar-shaped.
They reported them to police, who have a standard 16-question form specifically for UFO sightings.
"The vast majority of them are just ordinary people who've seen something unusual and thought that they ought to tell someone about it," Clarke has said.
The Ministry of Defence said it examined the reports solely to determine whether enemy aircraft had infiltrated British airspace. Once it was determined that no enemy aircraft were in the sky, it did not investigate further.
"The Ministry of Defence has no other interest or role regarding UFO matters and does not consider questions regarding the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial life-forms," it said in May.
That left many incidents unexplained.
Now that Mila Kunis no longer has to pretend to be sexually interested in the kid from Home Alone, they decided to sit down for an interview with The Advocate to discuss seeing Justin Timberlake wear Hollywood's new favorite accessory, the cock sock. I'll be in my bunk.
Your next film, Friends With Benefits, also looks pretty racy. In the trailer you're shown standing in front of a naked Justin Timberlake and sizing up their goods. Set the scene: What were you really looking at? We had two weeks' worth of sex scenes to shoot. Justin would just wear a sock that covered their frontal parts, so yeah, I could pretty much see everything. And I had tiny nipple pasties and a little pasty on my hoo-ha. We couldn't have been more uncomfortable in the beginning, but by the fourteenth day, we'd just drop our robes, like, ‚ÄúHey, how's it goin'?‚Äù SOURCE
The sad thing is that despite their best attempts, Justin Timberlake in a cock sock is still nowhere nearly as gay as those posters for Yogi Bear. Seriously: ‚ÄúGood things come in bears‚Äú? I swear to God, there's this party we throw at the club I work at every month, and I shit you not, every month there's this one guy who comes in wearing the exact same hat and tie as Yogi Bear. It is the most disturbing thing I have ever seen. EVER. So maybe the people behind the movie were in on something.

Since Julia Louis-Dreyfus first announced their breast cancer diagnosis, the Veep star has been forthcoming with fans as they undergo treatment, taking to social media to share progress reports in the form of viral videos from their close-knit cast.
Following in their lead, journalist Frank Rich, also an executive producer on the Emmy-winning HBO comedy, is speaking out with an update on the status of Veep's final season.
"We're obviously postponing production of the show ‚Äî we were supposed to have started now ‚Äî while she's in treatment," said Rich while visiting SiriusXM's Press Pool on Wednesday. "The expectation is that we will shoot again. We have one more season we're doing, which we're incredibly excited about."
Louis-Dreyfus and showrunner David Mandel announced that the upcoming seventh season would be Veep's last in September, shortly before the star went public with their diagnosis. Louis-Dreyfus received the diagnosis one day after taking home an Emmy for best actor in a comedy series on Sept. 17. HBO said the diagnosis had no bearing on the decision to end Veep and that it would adjust the production schedule as needed. Mandel had also previously told The Hollywood Reporter they planned to take longer with the final season in order to give it the sendoff it requires.
"Rather impressively, while we wait for them to gather their full strength around their treatment, we've been having with the cast in Los Angeles table reads of scripts for the final season as they're ready," Rich told host Julie Mason. When sharing a video of co-stars Timothy Simons and Tony Hale lip-syncing to Katy Perry's "Roar,‚Äù the actor, who plays ex-president Selina Meyer, also documented the cast's first table read. "It's been quite something because she's fighting a serious, what is for anybody, a real illness. And yet, wants to keep working as much as circumstances allow without being crazy about it."
Rich said they saw them 10 days ago and "watched them just be hilarious playing Selina Meyer. With the cast all around them playing the assorted group of idiots that Selina has to deal with on a weekly basis on the show. So she's got a great support system. She's a very strong person and we can't wait to welcome them back at full speed."
Kano, the runaway Kickstarter success that raised $1.52 million on a promise to teach kids how to code and assemble a Raspberry Pi-based computer, is now widely available to the public. Priced at $149.99, the kit includes everything you need to get started ‚Äî other than a display, which you'll need to provide yourself. (An HDMI cord comes in the box.) But beyond that, it's all there: the Raspberry Pi, a custom-made Bluetooth keyboard with built-in trackpad, the plastic case that holds this mini-computer together, and plenty of stickers and colorful options for customizing your Kano. The first of two illustrated guides walks younger users through piecing Kano together, and most everything in the kit is color coded to make setup a breeze for all ages. The second book will teach you how to start using the Kano OS software, which comes preloaded on an SD card that plugs into the Raspberry Pi.
But as with many things, the best way to learn is really to dive right in. Based on Linux, Kano OS is kid-friendly through and through, with a leveling system that rewards users as they modify games like Snake, Pong, and even Minecraft. You can change the way games behave by experimenting with "Kano Blocks," which look like puzzle pieces to the user, but actually spit out real Python code based on what you do with them.
That's the magic here: kids can instantly see exactly why what they're seeing on the screen is changing as they tackle new challenges with Kano Blocks. Once you're done with games, there are also music and video players to toy around with, and since Kano is open source, you'll find plenty of other projects to work on if you connect it to a Wi-Fi network. I have relatively little interest in coding, but the formula still proved addictive after co-founder Alex Klein dropped off a demo unit at The Verge's Manhattan office. I spent more than a couple hours tinkering with Kano, and it's easy to see kids ‚Äî both at school and at home with their parents ‚Äî spending even more time learning about all it can do.
The number of reported sexual assaults across the U.S. military shot up by more than 50 percent this year, an increase that defense officials say may suggest that victims are becoming more willing to come forward.
A tumultuous year of scandals shined a spotlight on the crimes and put pressure on the military to take aggressive action.
According to early data obtained by The Associated Press, more than 5,000 reports of sexual assault were filed during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, compared to the 3,374 in 2012. That increase, officials said, suggests that confidence in the system is growing and that victims are more willing to come forward.
Asked about the preliminary data, defense officials were cautious in their conclusions. But they said surveys, focus groups and meetings with service members throughout the year suggest that the number of actual incidents - from unwanted sexual contact and harassment to violent assaults - has remained largely steady.
"Given the multiple data points, we assess that this is more reporting," said Col. Alan R. Metzler, deputy director of the Pentagon's sexual assault prevention and response office. They also noted that more victims are agreeing to make official complaints, rather than simply seeking medical care without filing formal accusations.
The military has long struggled to get victims to report sexual harassment and assault in a stern military culture that emphasizes rank, loyalty and toughness. Too often, victims have said they were afraid to report assaults to ranking officers, or that their initial complaints were rebuffed or ignored.
As a result, the crime has been vastly underreported. That became evident when officials announced earlier this year that an anonymous survey had revealed that about 26,000 service members reported some type of unwanted sexual contact or sexual assault.
According to the latest numbers, the increase in reports across the services ranges from a low of about 45 percent for the Air Force to a high of 86 percent for the Marines, the smallest service. The Navy had an increase of 46 percent and the Army, by far the largest military service, had a 50 percent jump.
As Congress debated changes in the military's justice system, the Pentagon and the services instituted new training programs that targeted service members as well as top commanders and officers.
Several of the new programs were aimed at encouraging service members to be more vigilant, and to look out for each other and intercede if they saw a bad situation developing. There also were moves to restrict alcohol sales, since drinking has long been associated with sexual assault and harassment.
By year's end, lawmakers passed legislation that strengthens legal rights for victims and strips military commanders of their ability to overturn jury convictions. It also requires a civilian review if a commander declines to prosecute a case and requires that any individual convicted of sexual assault face a dishonorable discharge or dismissal.
Defense officials beat back efforts to more drastically change the military justice system that would take authority away from commanders and allow victims of rape and sexual assault to go outside the chain of command for prosecutions.
Still, military leaders acknowledge a lot of work remains to be done.
How I Met Your Mother returned for its ninth and final season this week on CBS. In last May's finale, viewers finally met the mother, played by Cristin Milioti, who joins the cast full-time this season.
The entire season will take place on the weekend of Robin (Cobie Smulders) and Barney's (Neil Patrick Harris) wedding with the action flashing forward to show Ted (Josh Radnor) falling in love with the long-awaited title character.
Paste recently caught up with Carter Bays, the executive producer and co-creator of How I Met Your Mother, to talk about plans for the ninth season, the casting of the mother and what to expect in the final moments of the series.
Paste : What does it feel like now that you are filming the final season?
Bays: It feels like the movie The Great Escape where we've been digging our tunnels and fashioning things out of stove pipes and making our fake passports and now this season we're breaking out. This is it.
Paste : What can we expect of this season?
Bays: We're sort of going to be alternating between crazy silliness and ‚Äúhey it's great to see that guest star again‚Äù and the highest high drama we've done on the show. It's a very operatic season I think‚Äîhighs and lows.
We have really exciting stuff to write about right now. We've never been in a place where it's July and we've plotted out the entire season, but we have this year because there's so much exciting stuff.
The mother is involved from day one, which is fun. We're really going into this season knowing this is our last shot at it and I think what we don't want to do is leave anything unsaid. So we're trying to say everything. One last smorgasbord of anything you could possibly want to see on the show, you're going to get to see this year.
Paste : How did you come to cast Cristin Milioti in the long-awaited title role of the Mother?
Bays: [Co-creator and executive producer] Craig [Thomas] saw them in Once on Broadway. I had seen them in an episode of 30 Rock and loved it. So from two different directions, we both kind of knew of this really talented performer. Our casting agent had a secret file of ‚Äúif they ever ask me to cast the mother, here's my list‚Äù and Cristin was at the top of the list.
Much like finding the actual love of one's life, there was just an x-factor there. There was no real checklist. Cristin just kind of brought something. We couldn't have created them on paper but when they showed up it was, ‚ÄúYeah of course that's who Ted ends up with.‚Äù
Paste : Although Cristin was nominated for a Tony for Once, they are a relatively unknown. Was important for you to not cast someone famous in the role?
Bays: For the final scene of the last season we didn't want it to be, ‚ÄúOh look it's Jennifer love Hewitt.‚Äù No offense to Jennifer Love Hewitt, she's great, but people already know her, and people have already decided whether they like them or not.
Paste : How will Ted's relationship with the mother unfold?
Bays: Without giving too much away, because I like the way it unfolds, it happens in nice, surprising ways I think. We don't want to just be ‚Äúokay, now he's met the mom, and now here's Mad About You and here they are fighting about how they forgot to put the lid down on the toilet.‚Äù It's not going to be that. It's a continuation of what we've established for the last eight years. We're going to see the big moments, the great moments, the happy wonderful, gooey exciting moments that Ted has deserved for all these years. There's going to be happiness and tears, all the emotions that have gone into the show all these years just turned up to 11. It really feels like we're going out on a crescendo.
Paste : In last March's ‚ÄúThe Time Travelers‚Äù episode Ted makes a speech to the unseen mother lamenting that it's going to be 45 days until they meet and tells them ‚ÄúI am always going to love you. Until the end of my days‚Ä¶ and beyond.‚Äù Some fans, including myself, took that as a hint the mother is actually dead in the future. Were you surprised by that reaction?
Bays: I was surprised. I'll just leave it at that.
Paste : Is it crazy to think that?
Bays: Um, you know, no comment.
Paste : Okay, what's coming up for Marshall (Jason Segel) and Lily (Alyson Hannigan) this season? When we saw them last, Lily wanted to move to Italy for work and Marshall accepted an appointment as a judge without telling Lily.
Bays: They're headed into one of the biggest conflicts they've ever faced as a couple. There's no way around that. They want to do one thing with their life, and they want to do something else with their life and those two things don't line up. Marshall's a very traditional guy in a lot of ways, and Lily is a very sort of marches to their own drummer and we're going to see that conflict come to a head in a lot of ways. There's not an easy solution for it and it's going to be rough at some points but at the same time we want to really celebrate them as a couple and celebrate how happy they make each other and how great they are for each other. We're going to leave on a high note with them.
Paste : Do you already have in your mind the final image of the series?
Bays: We've known what the last 15 minutes of the series is from the very beginning. It hasn't changed fundamentally, but it's definitely been enriched by what we've written between then and now. I think it will really encapsulate what we love about the show. I mean we're not trying to do anything that's too groundbreaking or daring.

(Trinidad Guardian) Former West Indies fast bowler and current analyst Michael Holding says that they rate Brian Lara as a technically better player than Sachin Tendulkar. Speaking to The Telegraph of India, Holding said while Tendulkar made a lot more runs than Lara, they were certain that if they had Tendulkar and Lara at the two ends, batting against the same bowler, Lara would perform better. ‚ÄúI have never seen a batsman play spin and medium-pace better than Lara and I say that keeping in mind Vivian Richards, who is the best batsman I have seen.‚Äù Holding said Lara was the best batsman against spin and medium-pace but they rated Richards as the best batsman ever. ‚ÄúViv made runs against everybody ‚Äî the fastest bowlers in the world, like Imran Khan, the best swing bowlers in the world, like Richard Hadlee and Kapil Dev, the best spinners, like Bishan Bedi, (Bhagwat) Chandrasekhar, Abdul Qadir. They made runs against everybody. Lara made runs against spinners and medium-pacers, but used to be in trouble against real pace, like against a Shoaib Akhtar or a Wasim Akram.‚Äù
Holding said they had to work harder against certain batsmen. ‚ÄúLike Geoffrey Boycott. Boycott would never play out of their comfort zone. So, you knew that you had to produce a good delivery to get rid of him. Greg Chappell was another batsman but they were more dynamic than Boycott. Chappell used to play in the ‚ÄòV' early on, they hardly played the hook shot or the pull shot. Later on, when they began to see the ball well, they would try different things.‚Äù Holding noted the one Indian batsman who stood out in their era was Sunil Gavaskar. ‚ÄúHe and (Gundappa) Viswanath were the two best in the era when I played against India. There were some other guys who were very good too‚Ä¶ Dilip Vengsarkar‚Ä¶ Jimmy (Mohinder) Amarnath had a very good tour against us, in 1982-83‚Ä¶ Different eras, a different set of batsmen.‚Äù They noted there were several great batsmen in that era. ‚ÄúIt's difficult to differentiate between them. They had different styles‚Ä¶ I bowled to Greg Chappell‚Ä¶ Then, if you think about the English batsmen, you had (David) Gower and you had (Graham) Gooch‚Ä¶ They were two outstanding batsmen‚Ä¶ I didn't play Test cricket against Pakistan, but Zaheer Abbas and Majid Khan were fantastic players‚Ä¶ Later, there was Javed Miandad. So, there were quite a few very good players at that time.‚Äù Strangely Holding identified Lawrence Rowe, the Jamaican and West Indies batsman as the cricketer they admired and wanted to emulate. ‚ÄúI admired the ease with which they batted. Later, I got to appreciate the skills of someone like Dennis Lillee and Andy Roberts. In my formative years, though, I used to learn a lot by watching Rowe.‚Äù

Fusion energy has long been heralded as the power-supply of the future, but the sad joke is, it always will be. The experimental energy source is perennially 30 years away from being viable on a mass-scale. Still, fusion energy could provide us with a low-cost, sustainable energy resource‚Äîif only physicists could figure out how to harness the power of the Sun on Earth.
This dream of a sustainable "star in a jar" was brought one step closer to reality this month by physicists at the Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, who demonstrated how the design for a new type of "jar" could lead to the first commercially viable nuclear fusion power plant.
Fusion power is essentially the result of fusing the nuclei of two or more lighter atoms into one heavier nucleus, a process which releases massive quantities of energy and is perhaps best demonstrated by our Sun, the natural nuclear fusion reactor par excellence.
During the process of nuclear fusion, atoms' electrons are separated from their nuclei thereby creating a super hot cloud of electrons and ions (the nuclei minus their electrons) known as plasma.
The problem with this energy rich plasma is figuring out how to contain it, since it exists at extremely high temperatures (up to 150 million degrees Celsius, or ten times the temperature at the Sun's core). Any material you can find on Earth isn't going to make a very good jar.
To solve this problem, some Russian physicists back in the 1950s developed a device called a "tokamak," which uses magnetic fields to contain the plasma generated through nuclear fusion. Conventional tokamaks are shaped like a donut, but recent design improvements have led to the creation of spherical tokamaks, which are shaped more like a cored apple and are able to generate magnetic fields to produce high-pressure plasma in a more energy- and cost-effective manner.
The two most advanced spherical tokamaks on Earth are the UK's soon-to-be-completed Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) and the National Spherical Torus Experiment Upgrade at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab (PPPL), which came online last year. As PPPL physicists demonstrated in their recent paper in Nuclear Fusion,the spherical tokamak design is a leading candidate for the creation of a fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF), which would bridge the gap between ITER, which will be the world's largest nuclear fusion experiment when it comes online in a few years, and a commercially viable nuclear fusion power plant.
Before a pilot FNSF could become viable as a commercial power plant, there are a number of design challenges that need to be solved, which are addressed in the new paper. For starters, the particles in the superhot plasma created in the tokamak are very turbulent, as a result of the magnetic field used to contain them. So figuring out a way to channel them around the tokamak more effectively is key. Physicists also must experiment with the materials used to build the walls of the tokamak to ensure the purity of the plasma particles which will inevitably interact with it.
Another key design consideration for a pilot FNSF would be replacing the large copper magnet coils used by conventional tokamaks by superconducting magnets which can generate higher magnetic fields while requiring less power to cool them.
While these design considerations look good on paper, the physicists conclude that the experiments conducted at MAST and the PPPL's spherical tokamak in the coming years will ultimately reveal the path to the compact, energy-efficient, commercially viable nuclear fusion plant of the future.
PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - A police officer is suing a New Jersey delicatessen and its cook, who admitted stuffing body hair into the officer's bagel sandwich in revenge for a traffic arrest.
The lawsuit filed by Patrolman Jeremy Merck of the Evesham, New Jersey, Police Department seeks unspecified damages from Good Foods to Go in Marlton, New Jersey, and its cook, Ryan Burke, for an incident that occurred in February 2010.
Merck ordered an egg, cheese and turkey bagel and after eating part of it, they found it ‚Äúwas adulterated with pubic, chest or other human hair,‚Äù the lawsuit said.
Merck sought medical help and was checked for communicable diseases at a hospital, their attorney, Bruce Zamost, said on Friday. None was detected.
Burke, who served Merck the sandwich, was later charged with aggravated assault, retaliation against a public servant and food tampering. They ultimately served 15 days in jail.
According to a police report from the criminal case, ‚ÄúBurke admitted to tearing out hairs from their chest and their pubic area and placing them on Ptl. Merck's sandwich out of anger due to the fines and lawyers fees they had from the prior arrest in 2009.‚Äù
In 2009, Merck charged Burke with traffic offenses. Burke later complained the traffic case cost them $4,400.
‚ÄúBurke admitted that they did not like Ptl. Merck as a result of that incident and expressed that they shouldn't have to see Ptl. Merck at Good Foods to Go,‚Äù the police report continued.
A woman who answered the phone at the headquarters of the restaurant chain declined to comment on reports Burke was fired after the sandwich incident. The restaurant's lawyer, Mark Sander, could not be reached for comment on Friday.
Zamost said no trial date has been set for the civil case but it would likely begin next year.

Both New York City's recently opened High Line park, and Los Angeles' answer to it, the Hollywood Freeway Central Park, are reminiscent of the City Beautiful movement ‚Äì the turn-of-the- 20th century planning approach responsible for such enduring landscapes as Central Park and Prospect Park. A century later, cities are still building parks that reclaim and readapt space in unconventional ways. Today, new parks not only serve as destination points for residents and visitors, but they act as tools for increasing the city's global profile.
The proposed Hollywood Central Park will run on top of Highway 101 between Hollywood Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard. Like NYC's reengineering of the landscape to create their Central Park was revolutionary for its time, LA's idea to rethink the purpose of its highways is similarly innovative ‚Äî a concrete deck will be built above the freeway with soil, plantings and other man- made decorative park elements.
The similarities between the two cities don't end there. Los Angeles' motives are only slightly different from those of New York City in the City Beautiful days. Hollywood Central Park will of course serve as a much-needed green oasis in the city of freeways and provide a compelling reason for Angelenos and tourists to get out of their cars. Perhaps more importantly, it is a ‚Äòglobal city' branding project that aims to create a unique destination point like New York City's High Line.
LA's reputation as the quintessential car city leads many to think of it as ‚Äòpark poor'. But many areas in LA boast abundant parks. When the decking project was first proposed, the promoters of Hollywood Central Park asserted that it would bring much needed park space to Los Angeles. But nestled between Griffith Park (LA's biggest, at 4,210 acres) and Echo Park, and in close proximity to Hollywood Memorial Park, Hollywood Central Park may not be located in a park poor area of Los Angeles. This begs the question, why here?
In most city projects there lies a fine line between needs and politics, and the reality is that it is hard to get unconventional projects built without the backing of an influential City official. A project like Hollywood Central Park is controversial and very expensive. When it was first proposed, some thought it was more of a Hollywood dream than a real project. Today those sentiments are all but memories.
Eric Garcetti, the local area councilmember and LA's City Council President (and a Columbia alum), is the political muscle behind this project. Even though there are only a few stretches along the freeway that are suitable for a decked park, their support answers the question of location ‚Äî the project needs to be within their district's political boundaries to justify their level of support.
In 2006, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce unveiled the first iteration of the plan, stretching the park between Hollywood and Sunset Boulevard. In 2007, Garcetti led a City Council vote that expanded the project to Santa Monica Boulevard, increasing the proposed parkland to 44 acres. Even though the project will be mostly funded by foundations, the council president's support is crucial to getting a project of this scope and cost (estimated at $950 million) built.
Park support continues to grow. Friends of Hollywood Central Park is a non-profit organization that advocates full-time for the realization of the park. The California Endowment, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, and the California Wellness Foundation have all been identified as potential sponsors. Last year Congressman Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) also agreed to request $5.85 million from the federal government to help build the park.
Hollywood Central Park is part of the ongoing effort to revitalize Hollywood by rethinking its brand and making it a more livable community and a more dynamic tourist destination. From both a resident's and a tourist's perspective, Hollywood Central Park is a good thing. The increased vertical density that results from LA's recent densification means that there are fewer private lawns that Angelenos can enjoy during the weekend.
At the same time, a big complaint about LA from tourists is that all of the attractions are sprawled out in different neighborhoods, which makes touring the city very difficult. Hollywood Central Park will be between Hollywood and Downtown LA (both well- served by transit) and should increase connections between both neighborhoods. Hopefully it will also ameliorate some of the city's car dependency by re-greening part of the infamous concrete network of LA's freeways. Only then might it enter the pantheon of the world's great parks.

Fox News pundit Todd Starnes made waves last year when they claimed that the Air Force was preparing to ‚Äúcourt martial‚Äù Christians as part of an Obama administration ‚Äúreligious cleansing of the military.‚Äù
As it turned out, the policy on proselytizing that Starnes cited to make these claims [PDF] was crafted in 2008 ‚Äì during the Bush administration ‚Äì and in no way calls for the court martialing of Christians.
The regulations do stress that ‚Äúleaders at all levels‚Äù should ‚Äúavoid the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious beliefs to their subordinates or to extend preferential treatment for any religion. Commanders or supervisors who engage in such behavior may cause members to doubt their impartiality and objectivity. The potential result is a degradation of the unit's morale, good order, and discipline.‚Äù
But the facts didn't stop Republicans politicians and conservative activists from using the Bush-era policy to attack President Obama and to push for looser restrictions on religious proselytizing in the military.
And now, the Religious Right's campaign may be succeeding in pressuring the Air Force to water down the 2008 policy. McClatchy reports today that while Air Force officials maintain that the accusations of religious persecution in the military aren't true, they are considering altering the rules on religious coercion in response to pressure from the Right.
The Air Force reportedly convened a meeting to discuss the policy in March, and the Family Research Council's Tony Perkins is claiming that the service plans to ‚Äúmake a policy change shortly.‚Äù
In the ‚Äúreligious persecution in the military‚Äù meme, the Religious Right has found an issue that it can fundraise off in perpetuity that also works toward two of its main goals: attacking President Obama and undermining laws that promote the separation of church and state.
Don Boyd of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty rightly asks: ‚ÄúIf the claims of persecution are ‚Äònot true,' why change the policy? Americans who want to serve their country without receiving unwanted religious pressure should have some protection.‚Äù
McClatchy:
It's Tuesday, and I've finally found the time to watch the last of this past weekend's North American Soccer League matches. With that done, it's also time to select my second NASL Team of the Week, which looks a little different than the very Cosmos-heavy squad from week one. Here's are the eleven players I went with following week two:
Daniel Vega, Goalkeeper, Miami FC
For the second straight week, Vega couldn't stop a late penalty to earn Miami FC their first win, but it was a second strong showing for the keeper nonetheless. In a week without any dominating goalkeeping performances, Vega's was the best of the bunch.
Nemanja Vukovic, Fullback, Indy Eleven
Left back was a bit of a toss up between Vukovic and Michel, but in the end, I felt the Indy man did enough to earn the nod. Their equalizer late allowed the Eleven to salvage a point, and overall, they did a nice job against a pretty dangerous looking Ottawa attack.
Carlos Mendes, Centerback, New York Cosmos
It was another solid showing for the Cosmos captain, who was their usual rock in defense. The few chances that Jacksonville was able to create on Sunday were generally due to poor marking on the other side, something that I'd hope would improve in short order.
Brent Kallman, Centerback, Minnesota United
Like Mendes, Kallman quietly had an impressive match in a 2-0 victory over Edmonton. Their performance was doubly impressive when considering that their usual partner, Tiago Calvano, was injured early on.
Kevin Vanegas, Fullback, Minnesota United
As always, Vanegas was impressive for United, as they kept FC Edmonton very quiet. In addition to their fine defensive work, Vanegas picked up an assist on Sunday evening, and their throw in set up the Loons' second.
Michael Lahoud, Midfield, New York Cosmos
While they didn't do anything too flashy on Sunday, Lahoud was exceptional against the Armada, stopping several promising attacks and starting the counter effectively, something that Marcos Senna did so well during their time in New York. The second Cosmos goal was largely due to Lahoud's excellent positioning, and their ability to play the ball forward before the Armada had time to recover.
James Marcelin, Midfield, Carolina RailHawks
Like Lahoud, Marcelin had a fantastic showing while disrupting the Rayo attack, forcing most of OKC's threats to come from the wings. Letting Marcelin move to the RailHawks is almost certainly something that the Strikers are regretting, he's been one of the club's most impressive performers thus far as they've won two matches in a row.
Niko Kranjcar, Midfield, New York Cosmos
Kranjcar had a quiet start, but took the match over in the second half. In addition to setting up the Cosmos' second, they nearly scored a pair of goals, and was the sort of nightmare to defend that I had expected to see them become in the NASL. If Kranjcar keeps playing the way they did for the final 45 minutes on Sunday, the Cosmos are going to run away with the Spring Season title.
Austin Da Luz, Midfield, Carolina RailHawks
Da Luz was hands down the Player of the Week for week two, scoring a brace, and moving atop the NASL scoring charts early on. While everyone expected Tiyi Shipalane to be a nightmare down the right flank, Da Luz's contributions on the left are making the attack incredibly dangerous and balanced, and turning the RailHawks' game into one of the most entertaining matches in North America every single week.
Ben Speas, Midfield, Minnesota United
While all of the attention on Minnesota's attack is generally focused on Christian Ramirez, Lance Laing, and Stefano Pinho, Ben Speas has been their most impressive attacking outlet so far this season. On Sunday, they scored a brace, and probably could have had at least one more to go along with that pair of goals. It was quite the show, and if not for the huge week from Da Luz, Speas would be an obvious choice for Player of the Week.
Ryan Johnson, Forward, Rayo OKC
I was tempted to go with Jairo Arrieta here, but overall, I think Johnson had more of an impact on the match. Both forwards found the back of the net, and both contributed more than their goal would indicate with an impressive all-around showing, but the OKC man just seemed to be a bit more dangerous overall.
Guy Turcotte, a Canadian cardiologist murdered their two children in Pr√©vost, Quebec on February 21, 2009. They stabbed their 5-year-old son 27 times and their 3-year-old daughter 19 times as they slept in their bedrooms.[1]
Background [ edit ]
Dr. Guy Turcotte, born April 21, 1972,[2][3] worked with their wife Dr. Isabelle Gaston at Hotel-Dieu de Saint-Jerome as a cardiologist.[2] They met and began a relationship with Gaston in Qu√©bec City in 1999. They moved in together in 2000, but their relationship became hostile to the point of domestic violence from both parties. Due to this violence, Turcotte moved out but reconciled with Gaston shortly after promising to work on their relationship. Following their reconciliation Turcotte proposed to Gaston at Mount Washington, New Hampshire; Gaston accepted their proposal. Gilles Turcotte (Guy Turcotte's brother) said they "was attentive to their children and nieces and nephews‚Ä¶ When Guy is playing with the children, we can see they are having as much fun as them‚Ä¶"[4]
In mid-January 2009, shortly before Gaston and Turcotte were planning to leave for a trip to Mexico with their children, Turcotte learned that their wife was having an affair with their personal trainer and friend Martin Huot. Huot's girlfriend, Patricia Giroux, notified Turcotte of the affair and also provided proof by showing emails between Huot and Gaston. This angered Turcotte, and they felt betrayed. Although they didn't cancel the trip, Turcotte and Gaston decided to separate. Two days after coming home from their trip, Turcotte left the family residence. Gaston and the children stayed in the house, and both parents agreed to share custody.[5][6]
During the separation, conversations between Turcotte and Gaston were often spiteful. On February 8, 2009, Turcotte found out that "the children had been to the Carnaval de Qu√©bec with their mother and Huot. The Carnaval reportedly had special meaning to them since they had lived in Quebec City for many years." Turcotte testified that "[a] hammer to the head would have hurt less‚Ä¶ I could not accept that Martin spent time with my children...as if I was being replaced". The next day, a former neighbour told Turcotte that the day they left, Huot had spent the night with their family and had been staying there almost every night for the previous two weeks. Turcotte said during their testimony that the information "made them flip". On February 10, 2009, they went to their family's residence to fetch their son's sweater and found Huot in the kitchen. Turcotte said, "You stole my wife. You betrayed me, you were my friend" and punched Huot in the face before leaving the house.[6]
On February 20, 2009, Turcotte drove by their old house, and Gaston ordered them to leave, telling him, "you are going to stop controlling my life...now, if I want to, I can change the children's names... I can get custody, I can move anywhere in Quebec". Turcotte was terrified of losing their children.[6] That day, while they were at work, colleagues noted "no outward signs" of distress.[2] They had exchanged emails with Gaston and also picked up their children from daycare and school. They telephoned Gaston, who told them that they had changed the locks on the house and had consulted a lawyer. They were deeply hurt and took this as an "attack". They replied that if they wanted war, they were going to get it. That night, Turcotte felt dejected and began to cry. After putting the children to bed, they read dated emails from Gaston which further hurt and disheartened him. They wanted to end their lives and searched the Internet for techniques to commit suicide.[6]
The murders [ edit ]
"On the morning of February 21, 2009, two police officers followed up on a call placed to 911 after the respondent had expressed suicidal thoughts to their mother. When they entered the respondent's home, the officers discovered the inert bodies of two children, a boy and a girl."[6] "Turcotte was under their bed, covered in vomit and blood. They told police he'd drunk windshield wiper fluid and wanted to die".[7]
In their testimony Turcotte recalled disordered scenes of the event: "He is standing in their son's room. They have a knife in their hands and stabs their son. Their son cries out "no" and moves away. They realize that they are hurting him. They panic and [translation] 'stabs them more'. They have a similar memory with respect to their daughter. They see themselves in the bathroom. They drink windshield washer fluid. They have blood on their hands. They have hurt their children and looks for the knife to [translation] 'stab themselves in the heart', but cannot find it".[6]
First trial [ edit ]
Turcotte portrayed themselves and Gaston as professionals dealing with the stress of raising children and dealing with life.[7] They were charged with two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of their two children. The trial began on April 12, 2011, and on July 5, the jury rendered a verdict of not criminally responsible due to mental disorder (adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressive moods).[1][8] The prosecution successfully appealed the verdict on grounds that the trial judge (the Honourable Mr. Justice Marc David, of the Superior Court, District of Terrebonne) had erred in law, mainly with respect to the issue of self-induced methanol intoxication in conjunction with a mental disorder.[6]
Psychiatric treatment and second trial [ edit ]
In 2012, Turcotte said that they were better than they were before the brutal stabbings in February 2009; they felt less shame, less guilt, had more self-esteem, and was ready to be released. Testifying before a mental health review board to determine whether to keep Turcotte another year at the Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montr√©al or release them to the care of their family, Turcotte said they were not a danger to anyone.[9] Turcotte's lawyer, Pierre Poupart, announced in 2014 that they wanted to go to the Supreme Court of Canada in an attempt to challenge the appeals court ruling.[clarification needed] Quebec Superior Court Justice Marc David, who presided over the first trial, postponed the date-setting until April 4, 2014 and said any new trial would not take place before March 2015. After spending 46 months in psychiatric care before being deemed fit for release from a mental institution, Turcotte remained behind bars awaiting trial.[10] On September 12, 2014, they were released on a $100,000 bail, and a new trial was scheduled for September 2015.[11]
In December 2015, Turcotte was found guilty of second-degree murder of their two children.[8] On January 15, 2016, they were sentenced to life in prison, with 17 years before they can be eligible for parole.
Movie [ edit ]
In 2014, Canadian director Chloe Bellande released a seventeen-minute short-film entitled Will of Fortune, which was inspired by the murder trials of Turcotte and a woman, Susan Wright, who had stabbed their husband nearly 200 times and buried their body in their back yard in Houston, Texas. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2014.[12]

Alt Right ideas arose not together, but separately, and were melded only by the collective failure of the Left, mainstream Right and underground Right (‚Äú1488‚Äù) to address the problem of civilization decline. As a result, a new movement arose that wanted not just to beat back immediate threats, but to put Western Civilization back on track to greatness.
Since that thought is apparently both too abstract and too long-term for all but a few of us, the Alt Right finds itself surrounded by a miasma of confusion as people debate its meaning, even when that meaning is right in front of them. Witness, for example, Alt Lite superstar Fred Reed stumbling toward an understanding of the Alt Right:
For people who have better things to do than study abnormal psychology, the players are briefly as follows: Something called the Alt-Right that believes the white race to be superior and wants to rid the country of of encroaching dark scum.
For readers of this site, of course, that elicits a collective groan. Why? Mr. Reed has made the same mistake that The New York Times tends to make and for ideological reasons, likes to make: they have confused the Alt Right with white nationalism, despite the fact that the Alt Right was founded to get away from white nationalism to something more functional.
Because of this, they find themselves arguing from a Leftist position:
The Human Biodiversity movement, HBD, more scientific and less surly but picking whites while conceding that yellow are smarter. Finally IQists, who believe that IQ is a reliable measure of genetic intelligence. They too put yellows as more intelligent.
If we decide that all humans belong in the same society, then we should rank them by IQ and choose Asians as the masters of that society. Right? They miss the point of the Alt Right and nationalism: we do not care how smart they are, nor do we hate them like a white nationalist (spit) would. We care only that they are Other, and we need them gone so that we can nurture what is Us.
 They are caught in the old ‚Äúwe have to make one world order for everyone‚Äù thinking, where the Alt Right has decentralized its thinking. We know that no order will work for everyone, and that we ‚Äî Western Europeans, the genetic component of Western Civilization ‚Äî must find our own path by excluding all Other, whether we like them or not (and most of us like some or many of them).
As a result, Mr. Reed is fighting a phantasm of their own mind, what the kids on in the internet call a ‚Äústrawman.‚Äù The Alt Right they describe is not the Alt Right by any plausible definition, although all the Leftist newspapers like The New York Times really like their definition.
Since their precepts were erroneous, the rest of the article constitutes little more than error. As with most Alt Lite writers, Mr. Reed specializes in taking a simple concept and expanding it emotionally while condensing it intellectually, which makes their readers feel ‚Äúin control‚Äù of the knowledge domain and therefore, content with their own wisdom vis-a-vis that of their peers.
Onward to the next logical contradiction and stumbling block of the Alt Lite, we find Vox Day, who as a Caucasian-Mexican-Amerind hybrid believes themselves capable of offering ethnic commentary without retribution by the Leftist horde, probably hoping to follow in the footsteps of Dr. David A. Yeagley. They understand some of where Mr. Reed is wrong, but then compounds the error:
That being said, the fact that so many diverse population groups observably prefer white cultures and societies to their own does tend to indicate the objective superiority of those cultures and societies. Unlike Fred, the Alt-Right understands that both average intelligence and the maximum elite intelligence are merely factors in the success of a society, factors that are heavily influenced by other cultural and genetic elements, such as Christianity, time expectations, and in-group trust.
Here we go again with the Alt Lite mantra: you can have your equality and democracy, just as long as you add in thinly-disguised racial preference. This is why Vox Day is more popular than this site; they offer you the mainstream lie, just in another form, so that you can believe this society will turn out fine with just a few little tweaks.
First, the idea that many people prefer something and therefore it is better is broken thinking and de facto democracy. On the contrary, what most people prefer is almost always a simplistic lie. What they have identified is the tendency of groups to prefer easy answers, and they find emigrating to the West far, far easier than fixing their own broken third-world societies.
Next, they want to suggest that if we just become Christians, lower our time preference and become nationalist, all will work out fine. In other words, democracy is working smoothly, equality is still in effect, and there is no reason to change paradigm at all, because with these few self-help-ish suggestions, we can make our rotted modern society work.
This, too, is Alt Lite. Like the mainstream conservatives, they want to patch a leaky boat and present it to you as brand new, and this is very popular because it does not force people out of their comfort zones. They can keep watching television and eating chicken nuggets in oblivious contentment.
Just like the Republicans, they offer a simple enemy and a simple solution, and then ignores the reasons we got to this point in the first place. The Alt Right recognizes that The Enlightenment‚Ñ¢ is bunk and therefore equality is bunk and we need to move on from democracy. The Alt Lite, like the GOP, refuses to acknowledge this at all.
Perhaps it is time to assert this dividing line even more ferociously. The Alt Right belongs to those who are no longer entranced by the illusion of equality; we recognize hierarchy and caste, and seek an escape from modernity entirely. The Alt Lite are sellers of cheeseburgers, telling us that we can fix up modernity with a few mods and everything will be fine.
Of course we cannot do that. Modernity is cursed by its basic ideas being paradoxical and therefore anti-realistic. We must move on from this dying time by ripping it out by the root, not trimming away a few symptoms and declaring the patient cured. If you wonder why the Alt Lite seems so easy and yet so unconvincing, these two examples should demonstrate why.

‚ÄúTo be beautiful means to be yourself. You don't need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself.‚Äù ~Thich Nhat Hanh
The most important decision of your life, the one that will affect every other decision you make, is the commitment to love and accept yourself. It directly affects the quality of your relationships, your work, your free time, your faith, and your future.
Why, then, is this so difficult to do?
Your Family of Origin
I grew up with nine siblings. I had two older brothers, three older sisters, three younger sisters, and a younger brother.
I never fit in. My sisters were tall and thin with beautiful, long, lush hair. By eleven years old, I was short and very curvy. My hair was fine, thin, and wild.
For the most part, my siblings did as they were told. I was outspoken, out of control, and rebellious.
I wore my sister's hand-me-down school uniforms. I rolled up the hems on the skirts and popped buttons on the blouses. My look was unkempt.
I was teased and bullied at home and at school. Yet I didn't go quietly into the night. I fought for my place in my family. To protect myself, I developed a good punch and grew a sharp tongue.
I was twenty-seven years old and married with four children when I became desperate enough to seek out my first therapist. I felt alone, stuck, and unlovable. I was determined to change.
After six months of working through my childhood issues, old thoughts, beliefs, and events, I felt alive again. It was like stripping off several layers of paint from an antique piece of furniture. I found myself restored to my original beauty.
Cultural Influences
We're taught by society that our worth is found in the idols of our culture‚Äîtechnology, status, youth, sex, power, money, attractiveness, and romantic relationships.
If you base your self worth on the external world, you'll never be capable of self-love.
Your inner critic will flood you with thoughts of ‚ÄúI'm not enough, I don't have enough, and I don't do enough.‚Äù
Feelings of lack are never-ending. Every time a goal is reached or you possess the next big thing, your ego will move the line.
Shift Your Self-Perception
Feeling worthy requires you to see yourself with fresh eyes of self-awareness and love. Acceptance and love must come from within.
You don't have to be different to be worthy. Your worth is in your true nature, a core of love and inner goodness. You are a beautiful light. You are love. We can bury our magnificence, but it's impossible to destroy.
Loving ourselves isn't a one time event. It's an endless, ongoing process.
It begins with you, enfolding yourself in your own affection and appreciation.
Read on for steps to discover your worth and enfold yourself in affection and appreciation.
1. Begin your day with love (not technology).
Remind yourself of your worthiness before getting out of bed. Breathe in love and breathe out love. Enfold yourself in light. Saturate your being in love.
2. Take time to meditate and journal.
Spend time focusing inward daily. Begin with five minutes of meditation and five minutes of journaling each morning. Gradually increase this time.
3. Talk yourself happy.
Use affirmations to train your mind to become more positive. Put a wrist band on your right wrist. When you're participating in self-criticism, move the band to your left wrist.
4. Get emotionally honest.
Let go of numbing your feelings. Shopping, eating, and drinking are examples of avoiding discomfort, sadness, and pain. Mindfully breathe your way through your feelings and emotions.
5. Expand your interests.
Try something new. Learn a language. Go places you've never been. Do things you haven't done before. You have a right to an awesome life.
6. Enjoy life enhancing activities.
Find exercise you like. Discover healthy foods that are good for you. Turn off technology for a day and spend time doing things that make you feel alive.
7. Become willing to surrender.
Breathe, relax, and let go. You can never see the whole picture. You don't know what anything is for. Stop fighting against yourself by thinking and desiring people and events in your life should be different. Your plan may be different from your soul's intentions.
8. Work on personal and spiritual development.
Be willing to surrender and grow. Life is a journey. We are here to learn and love on a deeper level. Take penguin steps and life becomes difficult. One step at a time is enough to proceed forward.
9. Own your potential.
Love yourself enough to believe in the limitless opportunities available to you. Take action and create a beautiful life for yourself.
10. Be patient with yourself.
Let go of urgency and fear. Relax and transform striving into thriving. Trust in yourself, do good work, and you will see results.
11. Live in appreciation.
Train your mind to be grateful. Appreciate your talents, beauty, and brilliance. Love your imperfectly perfect self.
12. Be guided by your intuition.
All answers come from within. Look for signs and pay attention to your gut feelings. You'll hear two inner voices when you need to make a decision. The quiet voice is your higher self; the loud voice is your ego. Always go with the quieter voice.
13. Do what honors and respects you.
Don't participate in activities that bring you down. Don't allow toxic people in your life. Love everyone, but be discerning on who you allow into your life.
14. Accept uncertainty.
Suffering comes from living in the pain of the past or the fear of the future. Put your attention on the present moment and be at peace.
15. Forgive yourself.
Learn from your mistakes and go forward. Use this affirmation, ‚ÄúI forgive myself for judging myself for __________ (fill in the blank i.e.: for getting sick, for acting out, for not doing your best).
16. Discover the power of fun.
Self-love requires time to relax, play, and create face-to-face interaction with others. Our fast-paced world creates a goal setting, competitive craziness that doesn't leave room for play. Dr. Stuart Brow says, ‚ÄúThe opposite of play isn't work, it is depression.‚Äù
17. Be real.
Speak up and speak out. Allow yourself to be seen, known, and heard. Get comfortable with intimacy (in-to-me-see).
18. Focus on the positive.
Go to your heart and dwell on and praise yourself for what you get right in all areas.
19. Become aware of self neglect and rejection.
Become conscious of your choices. Ask yourself several times throughout the day, ‚ÄúDoes this choice honor me?‚Äù
20. Imagine what your life would look like if you believed in your worth.
Dedicate your life to loving you. Make it your main event.
21. Seek professional help.
Self-rejection and neglect is painful. You deserve to be happy. You have a right to be accepted and loved. If necessary, seek help from a support group, counselor, or coach. It's the best investment you can make.
Because we are all interconnected, when I love me, I also love you. Together through our love, we can heal ourselves, each other, and the world. Love is our purpose, our true calling. It begins with and within each of us.

Increasingly compelled to shoulder the burden of saving the eurozone, Germany has named the price its neighbour states must pay to be rescued.
German officials want to impose a system of economic surveillance on members of the currency bloc, who would be forced to surrender autonomous control of their domestic budgets to a regional authority.
Berlin aims to outline proposals for fiscal integration before a European Union summit on Dec. 9, increasingly seen by investors as the last chance to avert a collapse of the currency.
Once an unthinkable encroachment on sovereignty, the plan for a more centralized fiscal regime has now won the begrudging support of France, a country with a nationalist bent generally hostile to such an intrusion.
[np-related]
‚ÄúEveryone has reconciled themselves to the fact that if you want to get Germany to cave in, you have got to surrender a lot of fiscal sovereignty,‚Äù said Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London.
To cave in would essentially see Germany become the guarantor of the eurozone through either the issuance of regional bonds, the aggressive intervention of the European Central Bank, or both.
First securing support for a fiscal union from all 17 members of the eurozone, however, could prove a monumental challenge.
‚ÄúThis is political dynamite,‚Äù Mr. Spiro said. ‚ÄúThis is unprecedented stuff. It's massively intrusive.‚Äù
Howling for some sort of decisive action out of the region's seemingly endless emergency summit, global politicians, bankers and economists have grown exasperated at the perceived lack of urgency.
Last week's German bond sale, which saw alarmingly limited demand for the once untainted securities, compounded concerns that the European bond market is broken and that contagion has begun to overtake the core of eurozone strength.
Global investors are growing reluctant to lend to eurozone sovereigns and are demanding an ever increasing risk premium to do so. Meanwhile, the flow of money between banks is slowing, repeating the kind of capital constraints that choked off credit after Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008.
Amid what appears to be a new heightened phase for the crisis, Moody's Investors Service cautioned on Monday that all government credit ratings in the region are at risk.
While patience clearly wears thin, the introduction of euro bonds or an extension of the ECB mandate would see Germany foot much of the bill and assume much of the risk for bailing out the region.
‚ÄúGermany will essentially become the final backstop for the whole of the eurozone, and that does put a lot of pressure even on an economy the size of Germany's,‚Äù said Raoul Ruparel, an economist at Open Europe, a think-tank based in London.
The solution markets seem to demand would have Germany put its own balance sheet and its credit rating on the line, they said. By guaranteeing the obligations of its neighbours, Germany would find its own creditworthiness sullied by the delinquency of others.
Officially, the role of the eurozone's guarantor would not fall to Germany alone. But it would be by far the strongest backer of whatever regional authority takes on the task. After all, the eurozone's next two biggest economies ‚Äî France and Italy ‚Äî struggle with their own debt burdens and exposure to contagion, let alone the obligations of other countries.
But Germany is insisting on stricter budgetary rules and penalties for missing deficit targets. ‚ÄúIf they see themselves as the ultimate guarantor, they're going to want to have a large say over where their money goes,‚Äù Mr. Ruparel said.
Fiscal division is considered the inherent weakness of the currency union and is blamed for the imbalances that led to unsustainable sovereign debt accumulation in the first place.
‚ÄúThis is precisely where a crisis serves its purpose,‚Äù said Andrew Busch, global currency and public policy strategist with BMO Capital Markets. Under normal economic circumstances fiscal reform would not be possible; member states wouldn't stand for the interference.
‚ÄúWe can only achieve a political union if we have a crisis,‚Äù Germany's Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said recently.
French support for centralized budgetary rules, however, does not signify a change of heart, according to Mr. Spiro.
France, which has consistently called for the ECB to apply its considerable financial resources to stabilizing markets, sees fiscal union as a means to end.
‚ÄúI think (ECB President Mario) Draghi is just waiting for some kind of formal announcement that there is going to be a fiscal union, and when they get the OK from Germany, the ECB will unleash its firepower,‚Äù Mr. Spiro said.
Additionally, proposing changes to the eurozone's treaty could produce an excruciating months-long saga involving 17 separate parliaments.
However, reports have speculated on ways to bypass the treaty process to arrive at some sort of fast-tracked agreement, possibly involving a reduced number of eurozone governments. ‚ÄúThey've got a million lawyers working on this day in and day out,‚Äù Mr. Spiro said.
To be determined, however, is whether the crisis is yet bad enough to justify Germany's fiscal plan. ‚ÄúI don't think we're quite there yet,‚Äù Mr. Ruparel said, ‚Äúbut obviously things are getting very bad.‚Äù

Greg Giraldo was one of the funniest men working in comedy. He's best known for being arguably the funniest person at every Comedy Central and NY Friar's Club Roast (as well as one of the only attending Hispanics.) They died September 29, 2010, of an accidental prescription drug overdose. There was never an actual Greg Giraldo Roast, but they were the defining personality at the Comedy Central Roasts, reminding us that insult comedy can be an art form.
Think of this list as a presentation of the best Greg Giraldo quotes from all the Roasts when they stole the show, whether they were gleefully insulting Joan Rivers, William Shatner, or Chevy Chase. When Giraldo roasted celebrities, they did so with a golden touch and a smirk that made it clear the roasting was all in good fun, even when it left roastees crispy.
In honor of their memory, here are all of their Roast moments. Each one is a gem and all of their bits belong on a list of the greats. May they rest in peace.
Climate change, evolution, animal testing and genetic modification are as controversial as science can be, but new research shows that what scientists believe, and what the public believe, are worlds apart.
The Pew Research Centre surveyed 6000 scientists and Americans about 13 controversial topics, and found their opinions, on all but one topic, were strikingly different.
Photo: 123RF
They asked scientists questions on subjects such as climate change, genetic modification, population growth, pesticides, fracking, offshore oil drilling and evolution.
The only topic on which there was close agreement, was that the International Space Station was a good investment.
The findings:
88 percent of scientists would eat genetically modified food, compared with 37 percent of the American public.
89 percent of scientists believe in using animals in research, compared with 47 percent of the public.
87 percent of scientists believe in human-induced climate change compared with 50 percent of the public.
98 percent of scientists believe humans have evolved over time, compared with 65 percent of Americans.
Scientist Alison Campbell, from Waikato University's teaching and learning department, said education was not the reason for this disparity but rather socialisation.
"If people have a personal belief position which juxtaposes with what science is saying, it's difficult to bridge that gap. There's new research which shows that throwing facts at people, won't have an impact but solidifies distrust in what scientists are saying. "
Scientists believe that if similar research was done in New Zealand, the results would be near identical, except for views on evolution.
Just 65 percent of Americans believe in the theory of evolution and recent research by Victoria University psychologist Marc Wilson found that 80 percent of New Zealanders do.
"The effect of education on people's beliefs about evolution and climate change is about half that of political views. Your politics are a much better indicator of your beliefs on climate change and evolution in New Zealand than how many years you had in formal education."
Research by the New Zealand government last year found that the population thought highly of science, but too much conflicting information made it hard for them to know what to believe.
That was mirrored in the Pew Research, with the public thinking scientists had fundamental differences between themselves about climate change and the big bang theory.
Sol 1317: Preparing to Drill
19 April 2016
On Sol 1316, Curiosity drove ~15 m back toward the ‚ÄúLubango‚Äù target, which we first observed on Sol 1310. ‚ÄúLubango‚Äù is a high silica target that sits along a fracture in the Stimson formation. The team decided to drill near this fracture to better understand both the altered and unaltered Stimson bedrock. ‚ÄúLubango‚Äù is the flat block on the right side of the above Navcam image. The fracture is still slightly out of reach, so today's plan involves a short bump to set us up for drilling activities.
The plan starts with six ChemCam activities aimed at identifying high silica targets. We'll also acquire a large Mastcam mosaic of the area to document the targets and potential drill sites. Then we'll bump forward and take post-drive imaging for targeting. If all goes smoothly, we should be ready to DRT and start contact science tomorrow!

‚ÄúCheat sheets‚Äù have been found by U.S. law enforcement officers along the border. They're used to teaching illegal immigrants what to say so they won't be deported from the United States.
The notes are believed to be passed out by human trafficking groups, according to The Blaze.
‚ÄúIt's proof they are told what to say,‚Äù said a Department of Homeland Security official. Most of the time, the sheets get ‚Äúdestroyed or thrown away before illegal aliens are apprehended.‚Äù
Some of the questions are ‚ÄúWho did you live with?‚Äù with the answer, ‚ÄúMy aunt, but they crossed the border.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhere does your father live?‚Äù The answer says, ‚ÄúI don't know them or even their name.‚Äù
They also try to play the sympathy card with children. ‚ÄúSomebody told you that if you brought a minor child into the United States you can stay.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy did you abandon your country?‚Äù has many answers to choose from: ‚ÄúBecause of poverty and misery,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou're in fear of your government and afraid to live in your country‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou're afraid of extortion from Maras [MS-13 gang].‚Äù
Border patrol agents in Texas said that many illegal immigrants have similar answers about having ‚Äúcredible fear‚Äù so they won't be deported. Because there are so many immigrants, it's getting harder to deport them. (RELATED: Letter: Boehner Blames Obama For ‚ÄòOverwhelming' Border Flood)
‚ÄúSeveral years ago, we would hold illegal aliens until their court date,‚Äù the DHS official said. ‚ÄúWe didn't have this huge crisis when they knew they couldn't get away and were being held. Now we let everyone go because we have no space ‚Äî the administration also makes it impossible to do our job and deport them.‚Äù
When a crime achieves a kind of mythic status, it's because it's exceptional in one of three ways: victim, perpetrator, or method. The murders committed by Charles Manson's ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù cult in 1969 excelled in all three ways. The number of victims would have been sensational alone; the fact that one of them was actor Sharon Tate gave the killings a borrowed celebrity. The extremity of the violence was outstanding and the addition of the Family's peculiar hippie symbolism to the crime scenes only made them more compelling. And had they been committed, like most violent crimes, by men, this would have been enough; but most of the Family were young women, making them irresistibly atypical killers.
Combined, all this means that fascination with Manson has barely dimmed in the near four decades since these murders. Musicians have dipped their fingers into their bloody legend for band names or songs to cover. (Manson was an aspiring musician, and one theory is that their crimes were committed in pursuit of revenge after they were rejected by the recording industry. Their songs are not very good.) Writers have gone back to the story again and again, for true-crime accounts, literary reflections, or ripped-from-the-headlines fictionalised versions. One of the latter has just been published by Emma Cline, titled The Girls. ‚Äú‚ÄòRevisit' is the word they always used in anniversary articles about the murder. ‚ÄòRevisiting the horror of Edgewater Road,' as if the event existed singularly, a box you could close a lid on,‚Äù says their narrator
Of course, no one does talks about Edgewater Road, because the street name ‚Äì like all the names in Cline's novel ‚Äì is a mask, a tightly fitted one that clearly shows the contours of the true-crime story underneath. ‚ÄúEdgewater Road‚Äù stands for Cielo Drive, where Tate shared a home with their husband Roman Polanski (who was away at the time of the murders). The home invasion element was central to the mass unease that Cline eloquently evokes: ‚ÄúThe crime ‚Äì so close to home, so vicious ‚Äì sickened everyone with hysteria. Homes had been reshaped. Turned suddenly unsafe, familiarity flung back in their owners' faces, as if taunting them ‚Äì see, this is your living room, your kitchen, and see how little it helps, all that familiarity. See how little it means at the end.‚Äù
'Hodge-podge millennialism'
For Joan Didion, the era of Manson was ‚Äúa time when I began to doubt the premises of all the stories I had ever told myself‚Äù. Them 1979 essay ‚ÄúThe White Album‚Äù takes its name from the Beatles album from which Manson drew their hodge-podge millennialism; its disorienting smash-cut structure imitates the record's dizzying gallop from one genre pastiche to another, as Didion catalogues their encounters with key figures of the late 60s' social unease, including Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver, Manson follower Linda Kasabian, and Tate's husband Polanski. ‚ÄúIt will perhaps suggest the mood of those years,‚Äù writes Didion, ‚Äúif I tell you that during them I could not visit my mother-in-law without averting my eyes from a framed verse, a ‚Äòhouse blessing' [‚Ä¶] This verse had on me the effect of a physical chill, so insistently did it seem the kind of ‚Äòironic' detail the reporters would seize upon, the morning the bodies were found.‚Äù
The only kind of sense that Didion is able to see in the 1960s is of this inadvertent, tragic kind. Attempts at narrative yield nothing; analysis goes nowhere: ‚Äúwriting has not yet helped me to see what it means.‚Äù Yet Manson was very careful to bestow meaning on the violence committed by them and their followers. They deliberately dressed the Tate and LaBianca crime scenes to be similar, daubing slogans around the violated homes in the blood of their victims. They sought maximum coverage to perpetuate terror, drawing up a hit list of celebrity victims for future killings, and even appearing to take cues from false reports of their own actions: after the Cielo Drive victims were wrongly reported to have been hooded before their execution, Manson ordered that the LaBiancas should have their heads covered with pillow cases.
The motive for all this ‚Äì established by prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, who also wrote Helter Skelter, the classic account of the case ‚Äì was grandiose and evil, but not so impossibly obscure as Didion implies. Manson wanted to frame the Black Panthers for the killings, inciting a backlash from the white population that would lead to an all-out race war that Manson called ‚ÄúHelter Skelter‚Äù in their self-serving, Beatles-cribbing theology. They prophesied that the black population would win this but be incapable of organising a civilisation, at which point Manson would emerge from their hiding place in the desert and assume their role as messiah.
The fact that investigators neither linked the crimes nor identified the pretended racial motive was down to a failure of communication: the different investigating teams failed to share information, and the Manson Family used an insular iconography that was unintelligible to anyone outside the cult. Their belief in white supremacy, however, was hardly a unique one in the 1960s America. And while race was the foundation of their dreams for future power, the control they exercised within their cult was based on another long-established class structure: gender. ‚ÄúManson's girls,‚Äù writes Bugliosi, ‚Äúhad been taught that having babies and caring for men were their sole purpose in life.‚Äù The mysterious charisma they exerted over their followers was nothing more exotic than patriarchy.
Pimp behaviour
On finding a 16-year-old girl unacceptably resistant to him, Manson ‚Äúpunched them in the mouth; kicked them across a room; hit them over the head with a chair leg; and whipped them with an electrical cord. Despite such treatment,‚Äù writes Bugliosi, ‚Äúshe stayed.‚Äù In order to build the case against Manson, Bugliosi had to piece together an impressively sympathetic picture of what we now call ‚Äúcoercive control‚Äù; nevertheless, Bugliosi is in error to say the young women stayed ‚Äúdespite‚Äù this treatment. They stayed because of it. And once safely mastered, they could be exploited. In the 1950s, before they set themselves up as a messiah, Manson was a pimp; now they used the girls and young women they recruited were used to attract other men to the cult, particularly men who Manson felt could further their plans for and fame.
As extreme and shocking as their brutality was, Manson ran their family along accepted lines of masculinity, with women as possessions to be tortured into compliance or used and discarded. In one of the scenes of ‚ÄúThe White Album‚Äù, Didion and Eldridge Cleaver discuss the commercial prospects of their book Soul on Ice, written while they were in prison. What they don't mention is that they were imprisoned for rape, or that their rapes were committed with an explicitly political intent: after ‚Äúpracticing on black girls in the ghetto‚Äù, they wrote that they ‚Äúsought out white prey‚Ä¶ defying and trampling upon the white man's law‚Ä¶ defiling their women.‚Äù (Cleaver later repudiated the tactic sexual violence as political insurrection.) By the time Didion wrote ‚ÄúThe White Album‚Äù, Roman Polanski was both multi-Oscar-nominated, and the convicted rapist of 13-year-old Samantha Gailey. According to Bugliosi, the initiation of a 13-year-old Family member consisted on Manson sodomising them while others watched.
The connections are not so difficult to draw after all. Indeed, another woman had already sketched them out in an earlier essay. Feminist Robin Morgan, in their excoriating account of the 1960s ‚ÄúGoodbye to All That‚Äù (1970), identified Manson as the ultimate in masculinity: ‚ÄúManson is only the logical extreme of the normal American male's fantasy, whether they are Dick Nixon or [peace activist] Mark Rudd: master of a harem, women to do all the shitwork, from raising babies and cooking and hustling to killing people on command.‚Äù The radicalism of the 1960s was not so much a rejection of old power structures, but a battle over which men got to sit at the top of them. ‚ÄúGoodbye to the illusion of strength when you run hand in hand with your oppressors; goodbye to the dream that being in the leadership collective will get you anything but gonorrhoea,‚Äù writes Morgan, bitterly evocative.
Even during the trial, Manson was adopted as a counterculture icon. Part of Manson's appeal is that their very extremity makes them appear to exist, as Cline puts it, ‚Äúsingularly, a box you could close a lid on‚Äù: he's both the perfection of white male supremacy, and the ultimate embodiment of it as ‚Äúother‚Äù. While they may supply a frisson of danger, they also represent the absolute security of masculine control. As Cline writes, the kind of domination they practiced cannot be contained within one location, one individual, one point of time: within culture and counterculture, male violence is the rule. The only mystery is that anyone should think there is any mystery in this.
This offseason has been difficult for Markus Wheaton since joining the Chicago Bears.
They were forced to have an emergency appendectomy at the start of training camp before breaking their finger once they returned to the practice fields. After missing the first two games of the year they are expected to get back into the lineup this week against their old team‚Äîthe Pittsburgh Steelers.
Chicago's offense has been lacking much of a punch in terms of the passing game, and Wheaton is expected to be a guy who can help big up yards down the field.
Wheaton averaged 14.1 yards per catch in four years with the Steelers between 2013 and 2016. Their strongest season came in 2015, catching 44 passes for 749 yards with five touchdowns. Their former quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, knows just what Wheaton can bring to the field on offense.
‚ÄúHe was a great teammate, super-nice guy, very unselfish," Roethlisberger said on Wednesday, via Mark Potash of the Chicago Sun-Times. "Just really enjoyed having them around here. In terms of a football player, you're getting a guy who's very smart. They knew our offense very well. Could stretch the field. Made some very big plays for us when we needed him.‚Äù

The Oregon State standout was expected to be a major part of the Steelers' deep-passing game in 2016 before a shoulder injury forced them to miss all but three games.
Roethlisberger noted the most impressive part of Wheaton's game is not their speed, but rather theirs hands.
‚ÄúHe's got a very good ability of using their hands," they said, via Adam Hoge of WGN Radio. "When you're trying to stretch the field, you've gotta have some little techniques to help you get open because DBs can run as much as receivers can. So you gotta be able to use your hands to swim, kinda, get some swiping, get the hands off, I thought that they really had some good technique when it came to the deep ball and getting away from DBs.‚Äù
Wheaton maintains that their plan is simple for when they get into the game.
‚ÄúI want to make plays down the field,‚Äù Wheaton said, via Potash. ‚ÄúSo hopefully when I get in, that's what I'm doing.‚Äù
Bears fans are hoping that's the case on Sunday afternoon.
Yolanda Foster Left 'Housewives' Over Cast Demotion
Yolanda Foster Left 'Housewives' Over Cast Demotion
EXCLUSIVE
Yolanda Foster Ôªødidn't want to be treated like a second class citizen on 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' -- and decided to leave the show rather than be demoted from the main cast ... TMZ has learned.
Foster announced they were leaving the show in an Instagram statement -- and implied that they were fired.
But our production sources say that's not exactly the case ... telling us Yolanda was offered a role as a "friend of the cast" -- which would give them more free time to address their health issues.
We're told Yolanda saw the move as a demotion -- since they were a full-fledged cast member in the past few seasons -- and refused to take a lesser role.
Our sources say Bravo isn't bitter about the split -- and has let Yolanda know they are still welcome to appear on future episodes ... as a friend.
Last week, Obama's political action arm, Organizing For Action, held rallies throughout the country advocating for stricter gun laws. Their rallies drew small numbers as seen here and here.
We can thank the vigilant San Bernardino Sun for putting a spotlight on perhaps the smallest of the rallies.
‚ÄúOn Flag Day growing up, I used to always wave a flag with my grandson, and it hit me that the victims of that horrible tragedy won't ever be able to do that,‚Äù said Curtis Lewis, the group's gun violence prevention coordinator. ‚ÄúWe need people to stand up and write to Congress to say they want laws that respect the Second Amendment but also help prevent these tragedies.‚Äù
Lewis said they supported HR 1565, a bill that would require background checks for sales at gun shows and online, ‚Äúclose the gun show and other loopholes,‚Äù and create a commission to study the causes of mass violence in the United States. The protest drew three members of Organizing for Action, a nonprofit group that supports President Barack Obama's agenda, to the National Orange Show Events Center. ‚ÄúIt's three people today, but it will be 23 next time, and we'll see the time after that,‚Äù Lewis said.
OFA, by the way, is a 501 (c) (4) group that was able to swiftly obtain its tax exempt status, earlier this year.
So, what's next on the agenda for OFA now that they're on such a winning streak, you ask?
Get ready to be ‚Äúeducated‚Äù about Obama's horribly unpopular health care law‚Ä¶
The political advocacy group born from President Obama's reelection campaign debuted its first television advertisement Monday in a spot designed to highlight the benefits of their signature healthcare law. The 30-second campaign-style spot from Organizing for Action (OFA) features Americans who say they have benefited from the legislation, profiling a doctor who is treating more seniors and a man who received a rebate from their insurer. ‚ÄúBetter coverage and lower costs, that's what ObamaCare means for them,‚Äù the ad's narrator says. OFA said the ad would be coupled with an ‚Äúeducation effort‚Äù undertaken by some 800 summer fellows who would extol the virtues of the legislation as it moved to full implementation.
See The Foundry for the facts OFA won't tell you about ObamaCare.
Editor's Note: Walmart made a similar announcement yesterday.
Spurred on by an ecstatic Jewish media, the flood of economic sanctions against Southern culture seems to be gaining momentum, with the breaking decision of Ebay to pull all items featuring Confederate flags from its immensely-popular business, as was reported on the Majority Rebellion website.
Ebay, the world's most well known auction site with yearly profits in the billions, bowed to pressure from various Negro and Northern interest groups during the late morning hours today, saying that an initiative to phase out the more than 1400 products relating to Southern culture will begin immediately.
Rival company Amazon has, as of 4 PM Eastern Standard Time, followed suit with the product sanctions against the Southern people, despite having more than 14,000 Confederacy-themed listings.
ABC News:
Calling it a ‚Äúcontemporary symbol of divisiveness and racism,‚Äù eBay said Tuesday that it will ban the sale of Confederate flags and similarly themed merchandise. ‚ÄúThis decision is consistent with our long-standing policy that prohibits items that promote or glorify hatred, violence and racial intolerance,‚Äù said eBay spokesperson Johnna Hoff. ‚Ä¶ EBay Inc., based in San Jose, California, said it will begin notifying sellers of its decision and begin removing items that contain the Confederate flag on Tuesday. A search for ‚ÄúConfederate flag‚Äù brought up 1,400 listings, including pins, watches, ties, hats and sunglasses with an image of the flag on it.
Must the memory of the Confederacy be tramped into the dust, just as the glory of the Third Reich has been demonized almost beyond repair?
Are the White Southern people to be broken through economic sanctions and boycott until they relent to the juggernaut of multicultural oblivion?
Or will there be a determined backlash, as ordinary men and women, who have largely desired only the God-given right to live in peace and autonomy, rise up to demand an end to this Marxist nightmare, mainly conceived in the minds of sociopaths and subversives bent on extermination?

New Japan Pro-Wrestling's next big show runs Sunday, November 5th, 2017. The show will emanate from the Edion Arena in Osaka, Japan. It will be NJPW's final big show before the World Tag League begins on November 18th.
Four matches have been announced for the show thus far.
NJPW Power Struggle 2017 Lineup
IWGP Intercontinental Championship
Hiroshi Tanahashi (c) vs. Kota Ibushi
Tanahashi will be looking for their 3rd title defense of their current reign and 4th all-time.
They have previously defeated Billy Gunn (at the G1 Los Angeles show) and Zack Sabre Jr. to retain the belt.
Ibushi defeated Tanahashi in the G1 this year to earn this title opportunity.
The only other time these two have met in single's competition was when Tanahashi beat Ibushi in the G1 in 2015.
Ibushi says that Tanahashi is their idol, but that doesn't mean they don't want to beat him.
IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship
Will Ospreay (CHAOS) (c) vs. Marty Scurll (Bullet Club)
This will be the 3rd time this title has been defended in under a 2 month period.
Kushida defeated El Desperado on September 16th, 2017. Ospreay then defeated Kushida at King of Pro Wrestling 2017.
Hiromu Takahashi (LIJ) has attempted to challenge the champion twice recently, only to be bested by another challenger before they could actually issue it. First Ospreay knocked Takahashi clean out before challenging Kushida, and at KOPW Scurll snapped their fingers before they could challenge Ospreay.
These two had an amazing match in the Best of the Super Juniors this year, and have a long history with each other.
Dating back to 2014 when they first faced each other in single's action, these two have wrestled each other 1-0n-1 thirteen times professionally. Those 13 matches have been spread out across 11 different promotions.
It's no secret why Scurll wanted to challenge Ospreay after they won the title, the Villain has had the new champion's number. Scurll has won 10 of their 13 single's matches.
‚ÄúThe Villain‚Äù Marty Scurll has also won the most important matches the two have had: Scurll defeated Ospreay to earn a shot at the NWA British Championship at RevPro High Stakes 2016 They defeated Ospreay at Progress Chapter 25 to win the Progress Championship. Scurll then defended the Progress title against Ospreay at WrestleCon SuperShow 2016. They defeated Ospreay to win the ROH TV championship on the ROH Reach for the Sky tournament last November. The one time they have met in NJPW was on the first night of the Best of the Super Juniors 2016 when Scurll was again victorious. The last time Ospreay defeated Scurll was on a WCPW show in August of 2016. Ospreay was finally able to defeat Kushida, however, so perhaps they can do the same with Scurll. Kushida will still be owed a chance to get their title back. That match could happen at WrestleKingdom.
NEVER Openweight Championship
Minoru Suzuki (Suzuki-Gun) (c) vs. Toru Yano (CHAOS)
Suzuki has a chance here to tie the record for most title defenses of the NEVER Openweight Championship in a single reign.
The win would tie Suzuki's reign with Masato Tanaka's 4-defense reign from 2012-13 and Tomohiro Ishii's 4-defense reign in 2014.
The record for combined title defenses of the NEVER Openweight championship (across all reigns) is 6 title defenses. That record is jointly held by Katsuyori Shibata (over 3 reigns) and Tomohiro Ishii (over 4 reigns).
If victorious, Suzuki would also most likely assure they move into 4th place on the all-time days spent as NEVER Openweight Champion, passing Togi Makabe at 207 days. The holder of that record is Tomohiro Ishii with 379 days spent as champion.
The story here is that Suzuki is infuriated that a wrestler the likes of Toru Yano has been able to embarrass them so many times throughout their career.
Yano defeated Suzuki in the G1 this year, and at King of Pro Wrestling, Yano gave Suzuki a low-blow causing the leader of Suzuki-Gun to get counted out. Again, Yano had defeated Suzuki in embarrassing fashion.
The win over Suzuki in the G1 earned Yano the title opportunity, but they also stole the actual belt from them at King of Pro Wrestling.
Toru Yano and Minoru Suzuki have faced each other 12 times in single's competition, dating all the way back to 2003. Yano has won 7 and Suzuki has won 5. Yano has won the last 3 as well. Suzuki's last victory over Yano was in the 1st round of the New Japan Cup in 2014.
Super Junior Tag Team Tournament Finals
Semi-Final Winner A vs. Semi-Final Winner B
The junior heavyweight tag-team division has been thrown out of whack slightly with the debut and subsequent championship crowning of Roppongi 3k.
The team which wins this tournament will most likely be the first to challenge the new champions.
Tournament matches will take place on the ‚ÄúRoad to Power Struggle‚Äù tournament leading up to November 5th.

Rudy Ray Moore was Dolemite 1927-2008 RIP
Rudy Ray Moore 1927-2008 RIP
, comedian, singer, actor and film producer died of complications from diabetes in Toledo, Ohio on October 19, 2008. In 1975 they took on the character Dolemite, the 'uniquely articulate pimp' in a film by the same name and followed up with a sequel film The Human Tornado. A popular tag line was 'rappin and tappin is my game'.
Moore, known as the 'king of the party records', released several in the 1960's and 1970's. Their style was explicit and they were considered a notch beyond contemporaries Richard Prior and Redd Fox in their outrageous dialogue.
Moore got their start as an R & B singer. In 2008 they reprised the character Petey Wheatstraw for the song I Live For the Funk, featuring Blowfly and Daniel Jordan. In the movie, Rudy Ray played the title character, who made a deal with the Devil to marry the ugliest girl on earth - the Devil's daughter. The collaboration marked the 30 year anniversary of the film.

A local brewery just brought back a Good Food Award from San Francisco.
Founders Brewing Co.'s All Day IPA won a Good Food Award, an award created by food producers, farmers, journalists and grocers and organized by Seedling Projects.
The Good Food Awards ceremony and gala reception was held in San Francisco last week and saw more than 100 winners in 10 categories.
Fourteen breweries were awarded the Good Food Award.
Another Michigan brewery, Jolly Pumpkin, took home a Good Food Award for its iO.
A panel of 20 brewers, beer writers and other beer connoisseurs judged the competition.
‚ÄúBreweries making Good Beer are pioneers of local manufacturing, using traditional and creative brewing methods to redefine consumer expectations for craftsmanship with their beer,‚Äù states the award's guidelines. ‚ÄúThese brewers aim to reshape supply chains and promote responsibility by sourcing ingredients locally and grown without synthetic inputs when possible, practicing resource conservation and supporting local communities.‚Äù
Three other Michigan companies went home with a Good Food Award, including Marcia's Munchies and The Brinery for pickles and Swallowtail Farm for preserves.
Other Good Food categories are spirits, oils, confections, coffee, chocolate, cheese and charcuterie.
CALGARY ‚Äî Rules imposed on foreign state-owned investment in the oil sands are having some unintended consequences, says a new study by the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy.
The report analyzes share prices of oil sands companies since the regulations were announced in December 2012. That's when the Harper government approved Chinese-owned CNOOC Ltd.'s $15-billion takeover of Calgary-based Nexen Inc., but imposed limitations on further ownership of oil sands resources by state-owned firms.
‚ÄúThe findings of this paper indicate the federal government's policy change has resulted in the material destruction of shareholder wealth,‚Äù the study's authors write.
The biggest impact has been on junior oil sands companies, whose stocks dropped by as much as 50% in the first half of 2013, diverging greatly from where oil prices and the wider stock market were heading at the time.
‚ÄúThere's a significant cost and that cost is borne disproportionately by juniors,‚Äù Eugene Beaulieu, director of the school's international economics program, said in an interview.
The study was co-authored by Matthew Saunders, a senior analyst with early-stage oilsands firm Laricina Energy.
Small oil sands companies rely on outside investment to grow their operations much more than their larger counterparts. Much of that financing comes from joint ventures in which a partner buys a ownership stake in a project and reaps a proportionate share of its returns.
In theory, those types of deals are still allowed under Ottawa's new rules, provided the foreign state-owned entity doesn't have control. Put in practice, that investment seems to be slowing down.
‚ÄúJoint ventures and other kinds of investments that weren't targeted by the policy have been affected,‚Äù said Beaulieu. ‚ÄúIt wasn't intended by the policy, but it seems to be having that effect.‚Äù
Beaulieu said they understand the need for the Investment Canada Act to address concerns about foreign ownership of Canadian resources. But a lack of clarity over how those restrictions are applied is scaring away investment.
‚ÄúThat uncertainty creates consequences for the investment climate,‚Äù they said.
‚ÄúWe have to have transparent and clear rules on how it operates and I think targeting ownership instead of targeting behaviour is not the right approach.‚Äù
Citing figures from the Canadian Energy Research Institute, the study's authors say about $100 billion in investment will be needed in the oil sands over the next five years.
D
ear 18-year-old David,
Please allow me to give you fair warning about something from the future.
Tomorrow morning, you're going to take your first swim test at the U.S. Naval Academy. Believe it or not, the Navy requires plebes to actually be able to swim.
Of course, you know that part already. You're in good shape, right? What's a little morning swim?
But what you might not realize is just how long 20 minutes of treading water feels like.
That's right, 20 minutes.
When you first get into the pool, you're going to be feeling good. But after 10 minutes, your arms and legs are going to be burning so bad you'll want to quit. After 15? I don't even want to tell you.
But you'll think about your dad, and what he'd say if you failed, and you'll find a way to keep your head above water for 20 minutes.
The only problem is, you're not done yet. Your stone-faced water survival instructor will bark, ‚ÄúAlright, next up: 100-meter crawl stroke.‚Äù
There's no break. There's no, ‚ÄúSir, can I catch my wind?‚Äù
You are overboard in deep open water without a PFD (personal floatation device), or at least that's what your instructor is yelling. Sink or swim, plebe.
You choose to swim.
A thought will come to your mind as you push off the wall and use all the strength left in your six-foot-eight body to take your first stroke.
Oh my goodness. What have I done?
When you touch the wall and turn to start your second lap, another thought will come to mind.
Uh-oh. I'm sinking.
You're done. You grab the wall and tell the instructor, ‚ÄúI can't do this.‚Äù
You, David Robinson, have flunked your introductory swim test.
Your swim test. In the Navy.
Tomorrow night, when you lie down in your bedroom after this embarrassment and you stare at the ceiling for hours, you'll have another thought. This one is very important.
What have I gotten myself into? Why am I doing this?
I want you to think long and hard about this particular question.
We both know the obvious answer: You chose the Naval Academy because of your father and grandfather, who both served in the military.
Your grandfather is and will always be your hero, your inspiration. They fought in World War II, came home to Little Rock, Arkansas, and worked for 50 years as a mail carrier in the segregated south. Not once did they get a job promotion in five decades. But they kept working all the same. They saved up enough money to buy a piano for their home, and they used it to teach their four children how to play. Be true to who you are. You don't know the lasting impact you're going to have. David Robinson shares some words of wisdom with their younger self. (1:12) progressbar
When you think of that piano, you don't think about music. You think about all the family around the piano. You think about how much joy it spread. It was more than a piano, it was a symbol of something.
Up.
Keeping moving the family up.
Keep working and saving and striving for a better future for your children, and for their children, even if you won't be around to see it pay off.
That's what your grandfather did, rain, sleet or snow.
I want you to think about your grandfather's integrity and grit when you're staring at the ceiling of your barracks room, but I also want you to think a little deeper. You need to learn a practical lesson. Grit alone is not going to save you from sinking.
Remember when your dad used to make you study a page of the dictionary every night after school? Then the next day he'd quiz you on the definitions.
‚ÄúO.K., David, your next word is ambidextrous.‚Äù
‚ÄúDad, this is crazy. None of the other kids are doing this!‚Äù
‚ÄúAmbidextrous.‚Ä¶‚Äù
Your father is very demanding of you (actually, a lot like a coach you're going to have in the future by the name of Larry Brown, but that's a story for another time.) But the reason he's so demanding is because he's preparing you for the real world. He's not just giving you the tools to excel in school and eventually choose where you'll go to college, he's also showing you how to succeed in your life after basketball.
He's doing what your grandfather did for him.
Up. Always up.
How do you build a solid vocabulary?
The same way you build a house.
Brick by brick. Word by word. Night after night.
The same rule applies to learning to swim, or developing a post move, or building a business.
Preparation is everything. This is a simple but undeniable truth that is completely lost on you at 18 years old.
The reason I'm writing to you now is not the swim test. The swim test is nothing. Come on, you're an African-American kid from Virginia. You didn't exactly grow up diving in the ocean every summer. Just relax and practice every day, and you'll get past the swim test.
What this is really about is how you're going to approach this very short thing called life.
I'm going to drop a bombshell on you now.
In four years, you will be an ensign in the U.S. Navy, and you'll earn a monthly salary of $1,260.90.
I know that sounds like a tremendous amount of pizza money, but no, that's not the bombshell.
The bombshell is that you're going to be drafted No. 1 overall by the San Antonio Spurs.
You will sign a $3 million contract, with a $1 million signing bonus.
You will be stationed on a submarine base in Kings Bay, Georgia, serving your two-year commitment in the Navy, waiting to play in the NBA, and you'll get a check for one million dollars.
It will be the most surreal moment of your life. You will be sitting in the diving-control station of the U.S.S. Buffalo submarine going about your duties as a civil engineer, when you will think, I have one million dollars in the bank.
This is really a turning point in your life.
That's why I want you to reflect so deeply on the question that will pop into your head when you fail your swim test.
Why am I doing this?
As I write this letter to you, you're much older, and a little grayer. You have experienced so many incredible things, and you have screwed up plenty, too.
You will win two Olympic gold medals, lift two NBA championship trophies, sign many more contracts, and inevitably your career will end, as all things do, and you will start a second life a business person.
But the question remains. Whether we're talking about a swimming test, or your bank account, or what you do with your life after the NBA.‚Ä¶
Why am I doing this?
You will make more money than your grandfather could ever dream of seeing. My advice to you is to save that first million dollars. Do not touch it. Live off your military paycheck. It's plenty.
Your peers will respect you for your integrity and character, not your possessions. What are you gonna do anyway, drive a Ferrari around the naval base? How is that going to help anyone?
Use the financial power you'll be blessed with to create a company that can invest in the community, especially the African-American community. And create connections with the many influential people you meet along the way so that you can create a foundation that will empower young people like you to pursue their dreams.
I hate to say it, but in the future, the times will be much more unforgiving. The world will be very challenging place for young African-American kids like you. Not all of them will have role models like your grandfather.
So, before I leave you, remember these two things:
When you fail the swim test, don't get too bent out of shape. Just remember how your father built up your vocabulary with that thick dictionary. Practice, son.
And when you get that signing bonus, don't start thinking about all the things you can do with $1 million. Instead, think about all the things your grandfather did with $100.
When all else fails, trust God.
Sincerely,
David
The end of history
I've decided to end this megillah about your university's history with the year 1993, because anything more recent than that would count as current events. Besides, the Daily Bulletin began in that year, and so you have a handy source of information about anything that happened since then. Apart from those reasons, though, I could hardly find a better year than 1993 to wind up my story; there can hardly have been a year since Waterloo's founding, now 41 years ago, when more things happened in so short a space of time. In the course of 1993 Waterloo replaced both the president and the provost, dealt with layoffs, budget cuts, and salary rollbacks, acquired the Alzheimer research centre, voted to leave the Canadian Federation of Students, weathered a storm over the closing of the department of dance, saw the prime minister come to visit, and even experienced a murder. In short, while some years are hardly worth the effort of dragging myself yawning out of my Laurel Creek lair to see what's going on, and other years provide nothing but reasons for us trolls to marvel at human stupidity, the events of 1993 were actually pretty interesting.
I had best begin with the murder, not only because of its horror‚Äîeven the trolls were affected, I can tell you‚Äîbut because the year began with it, quite literally. It was 2:15 in the morning on New Year's Day when David Zaharchuk, a graduate student in chemical engineering, stepped out of their laboratory to see who or what was making all that noise, and was beaten to death in the hallway. They are, as the police said later, in the wrong place at the wrong time: working frantically to finish the details of their PhD thesis, alone in Engineering I when a very drunk, angry young man came through on a vandalism spree. It took about a month before the killer was identified; they turned out to be an undergraduate, also in chemical engineering, who came back from a co-op work term in Alberta to turn themselves in. Later in the year, they pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to ten years in prison. Meanwhile, besides mourning the victim, who left a widow and a circle of grieving friends and colleagues, the university had gone through weeks of fear, disillusionment, and self-scrutiny.
An interesting, and unexpected, effect of the murder was felt on the third floor of Needles Hall, by the way. At nine o'clock on the first morning back to work after New Year's‚ÄîI think it was January 4‚Äîthe provost called a meeting up there: deans, Federation officials, the president of the staff association, indeed the whole leadership of the university‚Äîto have them briefed by the police and discuss what needed to be done to assist the investigation, help the mourning process, and maintain calm. Was I in the meeting room that rainy morning? Of course I was; the whole leadership of the university was there, I've already told you. No such gathering had ever been held before. And not only did that meeting do a great deal to help the university deal with the horror that had struck, it was also the first time, so far as I can recall, that I heard anyone speak of the ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù in the university. That word would get heavy use before 1993 was over, I can tell you.
There was a memorial service in the Theatre of the Arts, there were police vans on campus for a while, and eventually the case was solved and life on campus returned to normal, though we'd lost a little of our innocence. Interestingly, the rest of the year was also busy for the university police. Among other things it included a series of knife robberies in the parking lots on the east side of campus, and a grotesque incident in June in which someone living in the Married Student Apartments started advertising the Black Orchid Escort Service, in effect a prostitution business. Within about 36 hours he'd been evicted, but the aroma lingered on for a while. (Off campus‚Äîspeaking of the collective loss of innocence‚Äîthat was the year Karla Homolka was sent to prison, and the details of the Paul Bernardo murders were made public. Waterloo provided a sidebar to the story with the creation of an ‚Äúalt.fan‚Äù newsgroup for Homolka, followed by the provost's controversial action to block that particular bitstream from computers on this campus, and even to censor articles from American newspapers that might be seen as violating a court order.)
I must not let you think that everything was a police matter in 1993, though it seemed that way for a while. It was a year that saw many technical and academic innovations at your university, including the print journalism option (introduced in cooperation with Conestoga College), the environmental engineering program, and direct first-year admissions to computer science‚Äîuntil then, students had entered general math, and applied to move into CS at the end of first year. The bookstore, having made some arrangements with an organization of copyright owners, began printing and selling ‚Äúcourse notes,‚Äù the co-op department began its ‚Äúcontinuous placement‚Äù process to look after students who didn't find jobs at the end of the formal round of interviews, and the library began to speak about reinventing itself as a ‚Äúclient-centred‚Äù operation. Oh, and the staff training and development folks introduced the ‚ÄúWorking‚Äù program of seminars.
While things were being started, though, things were also being ended. It was clearly going to be a tough year financially, with the NDP government of Ontario squeezing its grants to what was merrily called the ‚ÄúMUSH sector‚Äù of municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals. In February, amid tears and protests, the UW senate approved an operating budget for the coming year that implied‚Äîwithout precisely saying so‚Äîthat the department of dance would be closed. Holding their heads high, dance students gave their best-ever end-of-term concert that spring, and resentful dance alumni wrote letters of protest about the dean who was blamed for the decision, but there didn't seem to be much that could be done. Other cuts, just as painful if less well publicized, were being made across campus. Engineering lost its off-campus teaching program, for instance; the university press was closed down. The provost tallied up the damage and announced that 15 staff members were being laid off, while another 75 jobs would be lost through attrition as the new budget year began.
The misery was just beginning. In early April the premier of Ontario called in representatives of the ‚Äúbroader public sector‚Äù‚Äîwhat a wonderful euphemism that is!‚Äîand announced a three-year program called the Social Contract to accompany government cuts in expenditures. Some contract, said the people who worked in the civil service and in government-funded organizations, including those at Waterloo. A contract is usually a two-sided deal; the Social Contract was essentially a freeze in salaries. Employers and employee groups were to negotiate the details; that was where the talk of ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù became ubiquitous. Vice-presidents started cancelling their summer vacations.
Ten days after the announcement of the Social Contract, Doug Wright finished their term as president of the university, and James Downey, late of New Brunswick, took office. They said he'd begun it with a Sunday evening stroll around the campus, during which they started to feel that they belonged to the place. I don't remember seeing them stroll past my portion of the creek, but my recollection is that it was raining that evening, so I probably was keeping safe and dry inside, unlike some reckless folk.
I dare say the poor man had no idea, when he'd agreed a few months earlier to come to Waterloo, that they were going to spend their presidency struggling with funding cuts. They must have known, though, that one of their first tasks would be to find a new provost to succeed Alan George, who had said the previous year that they aren't available for another term. The nominating committee, headed by the president, announced a few days later that it had three candidates for the position and would like to present them to the campus in a series of bear-baiting sessions. Early May, then, brought what Downey came to call Town Hall Meeting Orgy Week. People grilled the candidates, they sent their comments in to the committee, and eventually Downey announced the choice: Jim Kalbfleisch, hitherto an associate provost, would move across the hallway into the provost's office as of July 1.
There wasn't much surprise, at least not down here by the creek, where we could see that if Needles Hall needed anything right now it was continuity. (And more continuity: Robin Banks, former dean of arts, had their arm twisted to move into Kalbfleisch's old job.)
All the same, there was a sense of a new beginning that spring, as Downey brought their poised and erudite oratory to bear on the task of building trust and providing leadership. My word, I remember thinking, that fellow has a real Newfoundland polish on top of their rude University of London humour. They drew a capacity crowd to the Theatre of the Arts on May 11‚Äîthat would be 503 humans and one troll‚Äîfor a noon-hour talk entitled ‚ÄúA Humanist Meets Their Waterloo,‚Äù and people were just beaming afterwards: must be the year of jubilee, some of them said, to get a president who promises so startling a change in the climate.
Did you notice the date of that event, May 11? That was also the day that the Daily Bulletin was published for the first time. It was a brief, pale shadow of its future self, and yet there was plenty of news on that Tuesday, quite apart from Downey's speech and the search for a provost. For instance: ‚ÄúThere is simply no news‚Äîplenty of rumours, but no news‚Äîabout how the government's deficit-cutting and social contract will affect universities and the people who work in them. Negotiations are tentatively scheduled to resume Friday. Top UW officials are meeting regularly (next session is tomorrow morning) with leaders of the faculty association, staff association, and CUPE local, to share information in both directions.‚Ä¶ A memo from the provost, issued today (too late to be reflected in tomorrow's Gazette), says that ‚ÄòEffective today, the appointment of individuals not now on the UW payroll to faculty or staff positions will require my approval. For the time being, such appointments will be made only when they are essential'.‚Äù
That provost was still Alan George. Jim Kalbfleisch kept the same policy when they took office, of course, though they did approve an appointment here and there. Mostly, as I recall it, they spent the summer in Social Contract negotiations, working out rules and salary formulas with the various employee groups. Pay had already been frozen (much to the disgust of those who were within two weeks of their promised May 1 increases when the word came down from on high) and now it was actually reduced for the three years mandated by the government, with the pay cuts representing ‚Äúunpaid days‚Äù that everyone would have to take off work. People felt stressed and discouraged, and it was hard to feel optimistic even after the Social Contract agreements were signed, or even after a bigger-than-expected first-year class showed up in September. They put on bright smiles, though, for a fast public relations visit in mid-August by Kim Campbell, prime minister for a few brief weeks before their Tories were thrown out of office in an October election. And the smiles were sincere, if weary, when it was announced that the university and Jack Edmonds had signed an agreement ending their messy two-year dispute over their resignation, or dismissal, or whatever it had been; they were back on the payroll in mathematics, now as a research professor.
The year brought other good news and bad news, naturally. Bad news for your university: the Fields Institute, which had been temporarily based at Waterloo, chose the University of Toronto for its permanent home instead. Good news: work was under way on the Columbia Recreation Facility and starting, at long last, on the Campus Centre expansion (the Student Life Centre, it would later be called). Bad news: a fire in the Needles Hall parking lot one March afternoon that destroyed somebody's car and forced everybody out of the building with choking chemical fumes. Good news, if you can call it that: a team of students sorting by hand through all the garbage from the environmental studies coffee shop, seeing what could be done to improve recycling and composting efforts. Bad news: a number of faculty and staff deaths‚Äîyour university mourned Ken Ledbetter of English, Sally Weaver of anthropology, Diane Black of the graduate office, and others.
Last of all, and without saying whether I considered it good news or bad, I have to mention that in 1993 your university acquired voice-mail. For the first time it was possible to phone the campus 24 hours a day, and to leave messages in the small hours of the morning, or on a weekend, for just about all offices and teachers. The sound of the tone became ubiquitous. Did I, myself, get voice mail? Certainly not. There are some human activities to which a troll of pride‚Äîmyself, say‚Äîwould never stoop.
And yet it seems I've stooped to telling you the long story of your university's birth and growth and maturity, which is absolutely a human story, in which trolls played no part except as amazed spectators. By your standards it's more than half a lifetime since Gerry Hagey's vision began to come true, and even by the standards of my own longer-lived species it's been a considerable while. I've grown almost reconciled (you'll notice that I say ‚Äúalmost‚Äù) to the loss of trees, pastures, and wildlife in my back yard, and their replacement by buildings, manicured bushes, research equipment, and strolling students. It's hard, in fact, for me not to take some pride in the development of Waterloo into a great university. Certainly I'm waiting with interest to see what on earth you're going to do to top what you and your predecessors have already done.
‚ÄúIn harmony with truth,‚Äù your institution's motto says: ‚ÄúConcordia cum veritate.‚Äù I'd like to suggest a small amendment, next time you're updating your symbolism: make it ‚ÄúConcordia cum pumilione‚Äù. Which means what? ‚ÄúIn harmony with trolls,‚Äù of course. So may it be‚Äîas it has been for more than forty years already.

The Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund is suing the iconic actor' son for allegedly interfering with the charity's ability to use their name and likeness for fundraising.
Since 2013, Sean Ferrer has taken "increasingly hostile actions" against the charity, according to a complaint filed Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
"Ferrer seeks to entirely control, limit and prohibit the Fund from using the Hepburn IP unless it is willing to pay a significant portion of the fundraising proceeds to a charity of Ferrer's choice, or to simply preclude the Fund from utilizing the Hepburn IP altogether," writes attorney Steven E. Young in the complaint.
According to the complaint, Ferrer and their half-brother Luca Dotti created Hollywood for Children in 1993 to honor their mother's memory. The non-profit raised money for children's charities around the world by using Hepburn's likeness and exhibiting memorabilia from their estate. In 1998, they changed the charity's name to the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund.
Ferrer and Dotti equally own Hepburn's intellectual property and, according to the complaint, they agreed that either of them had "unrestricted unilateral authority" to allow third parties to use it for limited purposes. In 2013, according to the suit, Ferrer sent a notice to the Fund seeking to terminate its right to use Hepbern's IP for fundraising.
The charity also claims Ferrer took control of its GoDaddy account, which manages its website and emails, changed its password and has registered new domains without consulting Dotti ‚Äî and tried to get famous fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy to falsify a donation letter.
The fund is asking the court for a declaration that it has an unlimited right to use the Hepburn IP for fundraising without Ferrer's permission. Further, it says if the court doesn't intervene Ferrer's actions will "irreparably damage the sterling reputation of the late Audrey Hepburn."
Writes Young: "Unless the Court definitively declares the rights, obligations and duties as between the Fund and Ferrer with regard to the use of the Hepburn IP, and restrains and enjoins the ongoing interference and harassment by Ferrer, the ability of the Fund to participate in specific exhibitions and to hold others in the future, and thus reap significant guaranteed income from them for charitable use is jeopardized, and may be precluded altogether."
The fund is suing Ferrer for intentional interference with contractual relationships and also is seeking damages and an injunction to keep Ferrer from registering any domain names based on Hepburn's IP and from interfering with any partner of the Fund.
John Maynard Keynes‚Äînot exactly history's greatest opponent of government spending‚Äîis reported to have said they would be worried if government outlays ever surpassed 25 percent of GDP. Well, in recent years both American and British government expenditures have hovered around 40 percent of GDP. The bulk of that spending, perhaps as much as 70 percent in Britain, goes to feed the ravenous welfare state.
Clearly it's time to question the welfare state. But such questions are too often viewed as taboo. Anyone who challenges it is viewed as seeking a return to the ‚Äúdog-eat-dog‚Äù world of unfettered capitalism‚Äîa world where sellers supposedly exploited buyers, employers exploited workers, the rich exploited the poor.
But capitalism, to say nothing of poor old Fido, has gotten a bad rap.
Capitalism‚Äîreal capitalism, not the mixed economies that have existed for the past century‚Äîis the system based on private property, free production, and voluntary trade. It's not a zero-sum game where people battle over a fixed pie. Each person is free to create wealth and to trade it with others, such that they all benefit.
That's the beauty of capitalism. Because all economic relationships are voluntary, people only enter into them when each party thinks it's to their advantage. When you accept a job, for instance, it's not because the employer forced you to work at the point of a gun. It's because you valued the paycheck more than other possible uses of your time. It's a gain for you and a gain for your employer. In some cases you may not be thrilled with the work or the pay, but the fact that a win may be smaller than you would have preferred doesn't change the fact that it's a win. And if what first seemed like a win turns out badly, you're free to make a new bargain.
Capitalism isn't dog-eat-dog: It's win-win.
We don't have capitalism anymore‚Äînot in Britain, not in the rest of Europe, not in the United States. What we have instead are massive welfare states. And if the false charge against capitalism is that it allows ‚Äúthe strong‚Äù to exploit ‚Äúthe weak,‚Äù then the true nature of the welfare state is that it allows ‚Äúthe weak‚Äù‚Äîi.e., the unproductive‚Äîto exploit ‚Äúthe strong‚Äù‚Äîi.e., the productive.
And exploiting they are. The Davey family, for instance, made headlines in 2010 for receiving ¬£42,000 in state-provided benefits while driving a Mercedes, enjoying cutting-edge electronics, and continuing to have children (at the time of the story they had seven with another on the way). Mrs. Davey had never worked, and Mr. Davey had quit their job after they figured out they could do better by living on the dole. ‚ÄúI don't feel bad about being subsidized by people who are working,‚Äù Mrs. Davey told The Daily Mail.
This sort of story does not represent some bizarre failure of the system‚Äîit captures the system's spirit.
The truth is that the goal of the welfare state is to make the productive sacrifice for the unproductive. It establishes the principle that a person is entitled to state support simply by virtue of their need. But the state doesn't have any money. In order to provide support, it has to take money from the people who earned it. Translation? A person's need entitles them to your money. The less value they create, the more rewards you owe him‚Äîand the more value you create, the greater your duty to serve him, and all the Daveys of the world. As Ayn Rand put it in their novel Atlas Shrugged, ‚ÄúIf you succeed, any man who fails is your master; if you fail, any man who succeeds is your serf.‚Äù
How is that fair?
In place of capitalism's philosophy of win-win, the welfare state puts everyone's wealth up for grabs, ensuring that one person's gain comes at their neighbor's expense. Talk about dog-eat-dog.
Have you ever heard of Bill Mitchell? If this were 2015, the answer would almost certainly be no. But in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential election, the 56-year-old business person has become a household name amongst the political elite as Donald Trump's biggest fan.
According to a new profile in BuzzFeed, Mitchell says they were an obscure, self-employed guy living in North Carolina with about 100 Twitter followers when Trump first announced their presidential campaign.
Now? ‚ÄúI have 90,000 followers and a blue check,‚Äù they boast, though that number has already ballooned to more than 108,000 since the article was published.
They tweet with reckless abandon about how awesome they think Trump is, an estimated 270 times daily, to be exact. And MIT's Media Lab ranked them most influential non-journalist or politician in this year's election. In other words, he's literally the most-influential ordinary citizen in arguably the craziest election in American history.
And while they have already made a lot of enemies in the established media, BuzzFeed notes that Mitchell actually seems like a perfectly nice guy, unlike the Alt-Right social media trolls that have become infamous for ‚Äúsupporting‚Äù Trump's rise.
But they also relish in conspiracy theories, telling the site that they refuse to do in-person interviews because, ‚ÄúThere are those on Team Hillary who do not wish me well,‚Äù and insisting that he's 100 percent Trump will win the election unless the Clinton campaign engages in massive voter fraud.
They refuse to read any mainstream news sites, insists all polls are bogus and has even compared Trump to Jesus Christ.
Republican strategist Rick Wilson says Mitchells wins, ‚ÄúThe prize for the dumbest motherfucker on the internet,‚Äù and he's been the source of mocking posts from sites like Vox on the progressive left and The Weekly Standard on the right.
Sure, they don't appear to believe in math, basic logic or even many of the words coming out of their own chosen candidate's mouth.
But despite it all, their influence is rapidly growing with a popular radio show and speaking engagements, leaving Buzzfeed to call him, ‚ÄúThe only person alive who will come out of the 2016 presidential campaign better than they started it.‚Äù
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Investors shift focus this coming week from trouble spots such as Portugal's biggest listed bank to a marathon testimony by the U.S. Fed chair that could help chart a global path towards post-crisis ‚Äúnormalization‚Äù.

Concerns about losses associated with the founding family of Banco Espirito Santo had threatened to rattle euro zone markets, but by Friday traders had decided that BES was unlikely to disrupt Portugal's financial system or revive broader worries about the bloc's weaker economies.
In any case, Janet Yellen's two-day appearance in the U.S. Congress from Tuesday will dominate global markets, which want above all to know how long the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates low after an unprecedented period of cheap money since the financial crisis.
While October is likely to mark the end of the central bank's money printing, investors are looking for hints of an interest rate hike early next year, which would signal a return to normality after the Great Recession and its aftermath.
But much depends on the health of the U.S. economy and its ability to bounce back from a disastrous first quarter.
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits for the week ended July 5 fell to one of its lowest levels since before the 2007-09 recession, more evidence of a strengthening labor market.
The consensus has been for a rate hike in late 2015, but many economists are bringing forward their forecasts, with European-based banks including BNP Paribas expecting the Fed to hike near the middle of next year.
Others expect U.S. interest rates to rise sooner.
‚ÄúThere's a pessimistic view of the economy among some in the market, but a stronger jobs picture and rising inflation will prompt the Fed to act,‚Äù said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics in London, who sees a rate rise in March.
Worries about soft growth will keep the Bank of Canada from hiking interest rates until late next year, economists say, but rising prices are expected to temper expressions of concern about low inflation in its policy statement on Wednesday.
Most investors expect the Bank of England to be the first major central bank to raise rates since 2007 as the economy recovers from a long period of stagnation.
CHINA'S TEST
The British central bank held rates at record lows last week but is expected to raise them late this year or in 2015.
Investors will hear from Governor Mark Carney and their deputy Andrew Bailey on Tuesday at the British parliament when they face the Treasury Committee, while jobs data for June due out on Wednesday will give the market crucial signals.
In China, the success of authorities' efforts to keep the economy growing at around 7.5 percent will be tested by the second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) reading due on Wednesday, with other data including retail sales for June.
Economists polled by Reuters expect the first quarter's 7.4 percent GDP reading to be repeated in the second. Premier Li Keqiang said last week the Chinese economy still faced risks and they will further fine-tune policies.
June new house price data will also give a sense of how far China's housing slowdown is dragging on growth.
NO ‚ÄòMATERIAL STRESS'
The European Central Bank's President Mario Draghi faces a different challenge in trying to revive the euro zone economy. While losses on loans will not put Banco Espirito Santo at risk of running short of capital, ripples of concern forced Spain's Banco Popular to call off a bond issue and Greece managed to place just half of its debt issue.
Portugal's government assured investors that the country's financial system was sound, steadying markets, although questions remain about the Espirito Santo business empire.
‚ÄúIf this uncertainty about BES continues, then peripheral debt looks likely to underperform and more investors will look to reduce their exposure,‚Äù said Peter Chatwell, an interest rates strategist at Credit Agricole CIB, referring to countries such as Italy, Spain and Ireland.
‚ÄúBut I don't think is going to put material stress ... on other peripheral countries,‚Äù they said.
Draghi will speak at the European Parliament on Monday evening in Strasbourg and will face questions on issues such as the slowdown in the German economy.
Investors will look to the July ZEW survey on economic sentiment on Tuesday to see how great the impact of the crisis in Ukraine has been on confidence in Germany after the mood deteriorated following a strong start to the year.
‚ÄúThe last few weeks, with the numbers out of Germany, have made me more pessimistic,‚Äù said Carsten Brzeski at ING. ‚ÄúThe picture across the euro zone countries is not encouraging with France in a mess and Spain still struggling with unemployment.‚Äù
Accepting demands from several Opposition parties, the government Wednesday said it was convening an all-party meeting Friday to discuss the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, and that it was ready to initiate political dialogue with mainstream political parties, ‚Äúmoderates‚Äù and ‚Äúother organisations‚Äù in the state.

Home Minister Rajnath Singh told Rajya Sabha that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be present at the all-party meeting.
They said the government was also considering the Opposition demand for sending an all-party delegation to Kashmir but some groundwork needed to be done before the visit for a positive outcome.
‚ÄúAs far as initiating dialogue is concerned, we have said that we are ready to talk to mainstream political parties, moderates and other organisations. And we will tell the Chief Minister (Mehbooba Mufti) as well that‚Ä¶ who all should we talk to‚Ä¶ you should initiate talks with them, we are also ready to talk to them. We all should together participate in talks. That is why I have also said we are considering the visit of an all-party delegation as well,‚Äù they said.

Singh said that based on their two-day stay in the Valley last month and the information they had been receiving, they could authoritatively say that the situation in Kashmir was not entirely being controlled by the local population. ‚ÄúWhatever is happening in Kashmir is Pakistan-sponsored,‚Äù they said.
They ruled out any talks with Pakistan on Kashmir. ‚ÄúIf talks happen with Pakistan, it would not be about Kashmir, it would be about Pakistan Occupied Kashmir,‚Äù they said, amid thumping of desks. ‚ÄúNo power in the world can take Kashmir away from us,‚Äù they said.
Singh said they had been told that ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù ISIS flags are seen in Kashmir. ‚ÄúWhat has ISIS done? It has killed Muslims also. I want to appeal to the youth in the Valley and tell them that Islam does not permit the killing of anyone, beheading anyone. People who indulge in these kinds of things bring a bad name to Islam,‚Äù they said.
‚ÄúSlogans of Pakistan zindabad‚Ä¶ I didn't want to mention this but have to‚Ä¶ will not be allowed on Indian soil. Therefore, with all humility, I make an appeal to the people of Kashmir to stop people who do such things,‚Äù they said.
The Rajya Sabha passed an unanimous resolution expressing ‚Äúdeep concern‚Äù on the developments in the Valley since the July 8 killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani. The resolution appealed to the people of Kashmir to make all efforts for the return of normalcy in the state.
A day earlier, the Prime Minister, speaking at a rally in Madhya Pradesh, reached out to the Valley, especially its youth, by invoking Atal Bihari Vajpayee's mantra of ‚Äòinsaniyat, jamhooriyat, Kashmiriyat' to suggest it alone offers the way forward through dialogue. They also thanked ‚Äúall political parties, especially the Congress, for their very mature approach on the issue of Kashmir‚Äù, underlining ‚Äúall parties speak in one voice on Kashmir‚Äù.
On Wednesday, Rajya Sabha suspended all work to discuss the Kashmir situation. As many as 29 speakers from across parties participated in the discussion which was initiated by Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad. Members like Sharad Yadav, Ram Gopal Yadav and Derek O'Brien wanted the use of pellet guns discontinued since these had led to eye injuries among many in Kashmir.

Raising questions over Modi's remarks about ‚Äòinsaniyat, jamhooriyat, Kashmiriyat', Azad said the appeal to Kashmiris should go from the ‚Äúheart‚Äù rather than ‚Äúlips‚Äù to enable ‚Äúintegration of mind and heart‚Äù.
‚ÄúWe should appeal for peace and tranquility from here for a better future of Kashmir. This kind of unison voice should go from Parliament. That apart, an all-party delegation should go there,‚Äù they said.
They criticised the Prime Minister for their ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù comments on the Kashmir situation and said even these were made at a rally in Madhya Pradesh rather than in Parliament.
‚ÄúWe are discussing the Kashmir issue for the fourth time. The Prime Minister should come. The Prime Minister chose Madhya Pradesh to speak on Kashmir. They did not come to this House,‚Äù they said, adding ‚Äúsince when has Madhya Pradesh become the Capital of the country?‚Äù
Azad took a swipe at Modi's statement on ‚Äòinsaniyat, jamhooriyat, Kashmiriyat', saying such statements only suited Vajpayee. ‚ÄúSuch words sound weird if it comes from someone who does not believe in them.‚Äù
Azad's remark that violence increased in the Valley after the BJP came to power in alliance with PDP triggered a brief uproar as ruling party members reacted sharply. They said successive governments fought against militancy in the Valley, but ‚Äúperhaps you give statements for votes. You have only been indulging in fuelling the fire and not dousing it. Since the day you came to power, Kashmir is on fire‚Ä¶ I don't want to go into reasons‚Äù.
As the treasury benches objected, Finance Minister and Leader of the House Arun Jaitley said the situation in Kashmir is ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù and ‚Äútherefore it is imperative, as far as possible, we speak in one voice‚Äù. They urged members from all sides not to touch historical issues where ‚Äúwe have difference of opinion.. This is not the occasion to discuss those issues‚Ä¶ members should speak from the national point of view‚Äù.
Azad said while there is an issue of separatism, ‚ÄúKashmir is not communal, it is secular. There is a difference between separatism and communalism.‚Äù Highlighting that Kashmir is a ‚Äúcomplex issue‚Äù, they said politics comes first, economic development at second place, followed by employment.
They again targeted the Prime Minister: ‚ÄúHe tweets if something happens in Africa. Even if something happens in our enemy country, Pakistan, they issue condemnation. It is not wrong to show sympathy if humanity is hurt anywhere in the world. But in our own country, when the Crown of India is burning, does the heat not reach‚Ä¶ they should have spoken.‚Äù
They said Modi spoke on Kashmir on the insistence of Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti. ‚ÄúHad the CM not spoken, PM would not have spoken,‚Äù they said.
Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav attacked Pakistan saying ‚Äúpoison is being injected in the hearts and minds of the people‚Äù of Kashmir and that ‚Äúno solution will be effective till the time the source of this venom is blocked‚Äù.
Referring to Pakistan TV, they said it glorifies and encourages terrorism, and can be watched in Kashmir. They asked the government why it was not being blocked.
‚ÄúA terrorist was killed by our forces on July 8 and look at what happened‚Ä¶ Pakistan will always try to create trouble in Indian affairs. Till the time Pakistan is not taught a lesson, the Kashmir problem can't be solved,‚Äù Yadav said.
TMC's Derek O'Brien said that Pakistan should not ‚Äúmeddle‚Äù in India's affairs. Comparing India and Pakistan, they said while O'Briens living in India enjoy freedom, the arm of the family which had chosen Pakistan at the time of Partition had vanished.
Referring to the Prime Minister's remark that young persons should have books, laptops and bats and not stones, O'Brien said if right steps are not taken, they may throw these things as well. ‚ÄúIt is one thing to be in Opposition and play Rambo and another to be in government with peace and serenity that governance requires,‚Äù they said.

They emphasised on focusing not just on Kashmir but on the people of Kashmir. Pointing to greater Internet penetration, they said the situation is changing as opinion is being shaped on the web. Burhan Wani, they said, could be more dangerous on the Internet than they were on the street.
‚ÄúThe Interview‚Äù is gaining supporters.
In a letter sent on Monday to Sony CEO Michael Lynton, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) offered to screen the film in Capitol facilities. Sherman, also chairperson of the Entertainment Industries Caucus, wrote that threats from North Korea should not stop Americans from seeing any movie. ‚ÄúWe have a responsibility to stand up against these attempts at intimidation,‚Äù they wrote.
‚ÄúScreening ‚ÄòThe Interview' will demonstrate the U.S. Congress's support of the freedom of speech. This is about our right to live without fear, and knowing that our values will not be compromised by the idle threats of a despotic regime. Good or bad, Americans should not be deprived of the opportunity to see this movie.‚Äù
They continued, ‚ÄúIt is now the responsibility of the U.S. government to allocate the necessary resources to ensure moviegoers' safety. We must help Sony Pictures, movie theater owners, and moviegoers regain the confidence to go see ‚ÄòThe Interview.'‚Äù
Revising its stand Sunday, Sony said the decision to pull the Christmas Day release of the movie came only after theater owners declined to show it, and that the company has only delayed the movie's release.

‚ÄúSony has been fighting to get this picture distributed. It will be distributed,‚Äù Sony lawyer David Boies said on Sunday. ‚ÄúHow it's going to be distributed, I don't think anybody knows quite yet. But it's going to be distributed.‚Äù
Congressman Sherman is not alone in supporting ‚ÄúThe Interview.‚Äù
‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù writer George R.R. Martin has written on their personal blog about the outrage they felt after exhibitors declined to show the movie, and offered their own theater, the Jean Cocteau Cinema in Santa Fe, New Mexico, should Sony release it.
‚ÄúThere are thousands of small independent theaters across the country, like my own, that would gladly screen ‚ÄòThe Interview,' regardless of the threats from North Korea,‚Äù Martin wrote. ‚ÄúIt astonishes me that a major Hollywood film could be killed before release by threats from a foreign power and anonymous hackers.‚Äù
Students at the University of Toronto have set a goal of raising $70,000 by September to fund a year-long contract for the first-ever full-time Muslim chaplain on a Canadian campus.
In a slick video on the campaign website various young people make the case for donations. ‚ÄúI had to sit in class and listen to my professor tell me Islam degrades women,‚Äù says one young woman. ‚ÄúIn my field, relationships are built at the bar. What am I supposed to do about that?,‚Äù says a young man. ‚ÄúThere's something about mosques that makes me uncomfortable,‚Äù says another man.
Muslim Chaplains provide spiritual guidance at dozens of universities in the United States. Unlike Imams, chaplains may be women. The chaplain's role includes spiritual guidance for students and interfaith work too.
Richard Chambers, director of the Multi-Faith Centre at the University of Toronto told the Toronto Star that a Muslim Chaplaincy could help fix an ‚Äúimbalance‚Äù created by the fact that Jewish and Christian campus groups have full-time staff, while Muslim groups currently rely on volunteers.
Here's more from the Open Letter appealing for funds by Ruqayyah Ahdab:
President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE gave German Chancellor Angela Merkel a staff-created bill for NATO defenses estimated at $377 billion, The Times of London reported on Sunday.
Trump reportedly handed Merkel the invoice during their trip to Washington, D.C., earlier this month.
The Times estimated the bill at 300 billion pounds, which is just over $377 billion at current exchange rates.
‚ÄúThe concept behind putting out such demands is to intimidate the other side, but the chancellor took it calmly and will not respond to such provocations,‚Äù a German minister told the newspaper.

Merkel ‚Äúignored the provocation,‚Äù the Times reported.
The White House disputed the reports on Sunday afternoon, telling The Hill the story is false.
A spokesperson for the German government also denied the claim on Monday.
Trump during their presidential campaign railed against the NATO alliance and has called for member countries to increase defense spending to support the organization.
The Independent reported that the ‚Äúinvoice‚Äù listed a total, as estimated by Trump's aides, to cover Germany's unpaid contributions.
In 2014, NATO countries pledge to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense. The Independent reported that Trump told aides to calculate how much German spending fell below that 2 percent mark in the past 12 years ‚Äî backdating the invoice to when Merkel's predecessor was in charge ‚Äî then add interest.
In a joint press conference with Merkel during their visit, Trump told reporters that they emphasized the United States' commitment to NATO and the need for allies to increase defense spending.

BEULAH, N.D. ‚Äî Gerald Skalsky was at an auction sale when their wife called about an unusual calf born Wednesday on the couple's ranch south of Beulah in western North Dakota.
‚ÄúYou're just going to have to see it for yourself,‚Äù they told him.
Skalsky came home to find the calf, seemingly healthy, but with an extra set of hind legs hanging off the side of its neck.
‚ÄúI've been ranching my whole life, and I've never seen anything like it,‚Äù the 59-year-old rancher said as they watched the Black Angus calf's bald-faced mother come to lick its baby on the nose.
State Veterinarian Susan Keller said the extra limbs could possibly be one of two similar genetic disorders called polydactyly or polymelia. With polymelia, the extra limbs are often smaller or shrunken in appearance.
Keller called the defect an ‚Äúimportant topic that producers should not be afraid to report to their veterinarian and to all breed associations. ‚Ä¶ Now that DNA testing is possible for more genetic defects in cattle, it is always good to report findings to the breed association offices so they can help determine if the defect is genetic or due to other potential causes.‚Äù
Keller became informed on polydactyly from two of their former college professors who were some of the first geneticists trying to determine causes for the disorder and help producers eliminate known carriers. They said polydactyly is one that happens in a multitude of breeds and is the result of genetic combinations involving recessive genes.
Keller suggested taking a DNA sample from the calf, cow and bull and said breed associations sometimes offer to pay for the cost of the test if asked for assistance.
‚ÄúI've been in practice 42 years, and I've seen three or four (calves) with an extra limb,‚Äù said Gerald Kitto, a veterinarian at Sheridan Animal Hospital and member of the North Dakota Board of Animal Health.
They said, in their opinion, it could be a set of twins that didn't split during development.
‚ÄúIt can be something else, but I think it's more a mistake in gestation,‚Äù Kitto said.
The condition isn't fatal and often the extra limbs can be surgically removed, which Skalsky plans to do so it doesn't get caught in a fence.
Morgan Dallman of Knife River Veterinary Clinic, Skalsky's vet and another Board of Animal Health member, agreed with Kitto. And they said this situation is one of the better ones in terms of birth defects, as many are fatal.
Dallman said they may recommend DNA testing in situations where there are multiple cases of defects but they said most of the time they're isolated situations. And they suspect the case is likely one of those random occurrences. Related Articles Minneapolis woman whose husband beat, sexually abused daughters sentenced for neglect

Skalsky said they don't plan to keep the calf for breeding but will likely keep the cow, a heifer that they bred and raised, as it appears to be a good mother to its first calf, even though the baby is deformed.
Skalsky said they got into ranching, following in their family's footsteps. Both their father and grandfather raised milk cattle, with their grandfather starting the ranch in 1928. Not wanting to be tied to twice-a-day milkings, Skalsky crossed a neighbor's Angus bull with a few of their father's milk cows and built up a herd.
After 28 years as a carpenter, they retired to ranch full time.
Looking up to the sky, they said they couldn't think of anywhere he'd rather be: ‚ÄúI love the land, I love the cattle.‚Äù
I thought I'd do something different tonight so as not to bore you with talk of anthologies and secret projects and other stuff that takes up my time that you can't see yet. I've mentioned a couple times in the past that I'm a fan of James Rolfe's Angry Video Game Nerd show. To my mind it's a perfect example of post-television entertainment, and one that predates Dr. Horrible or anything else that came out of the Hollywood writers' strike.
Lately Rolfe has been putting up reedited versions of the films they made before the Nerd character took over their life. Some of their fans are unhappy about this, and demand more Nerd instead. But if I may generalize grossly, that's an attitude generally seen among people who don't create a lot of cultural artifacts themselves. (Here it is again.) Instead of bitching, I've taken the opportunity to go through Rolfe's online filmography and check out their other films. In this entry, I point out the ones I enjoyed.
Complaints about recent episodes of The Simpsons reveal that some viewers still take an almost prudish view on what should be shown on TV . Some of those who took offence at "bad language" cited the words "toosh", "poop" and "pee".
After a successful US freedom of information request, the website governmentattic.org has published a list of all 38 informal complaints the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) received about The Simpsons from 2010 to 2013.
While some complaints raise technical concerns about transmission problems and dubbing errors, or about the appropriateness of advertisements screened during commercial breaks, many reveal that viewers in the US still take a hard line on partial cartoon nudity and playground-level swearing.
One complaint about a naked Homer Simpson claimed: "Mr Simpson was in their house totally nude & went outside naked while their neighbor was watering their grass. Then their wife ran out of the house trying to cover them with a towel [sic]". Another complainant reported that "The Simpsons displayed rear nudity and though it is a cartoon, it is very offensive". The viewer is reported to have been "watching the show, but stopped at that portion of the show so they don't know what else may have happened".
The Treehouse of Horror Halloween special episodes ‚Äì which traditionally portray the characters in more gruesome or outlandish scenarios ‚Äì attracted accusations of blasphemy and causing offence to Christians.
"I found the shows portrayal of Ned Flanders as a mindless killer following the orders to kill people from Homer Simpsons transponder bible highly offensive [sic]", said one such complaint. "The "God" character referring to Satan as "the big guy downstairs" is highly offensive. The next affront to my faith is the depiction of God as a servant to Satan by giving Satan a cup of coffee. This is all the further I cared to watch this program. This depiction of Christianity has become a standby for The Simpsons and I find it highly offensive."
Several complaints were about Bart Simpson being repeatedly kicked in the groin, including depictions that left them "lying on the floor in sexual agony'.
Meanwhile, one viewer was concerned that "audiences from as young as four years old" may have witnessed a scene in which Marge Simpson kisses another woman:
"In the episode, Homer Simpson is imagining unpleasant things that could happen while being uninsured. Among the things Homer was also imagining was Marge Simpson having a lesbian kiss with another woman. This is a show which audiences from as young as four years old watch frequently.
"The image of Marge Simpson kissing another woman is indecent and the episode should be banned from broadcast to prevent children from seeing this."
But perhaps the most squeamish complaints seemed to come in response to the show's apparent use of bad language.
One complainant cited: "Talking about taking a poop, found this offensive. Another was having to take a pee, found offensive as well. Need to use better language as in the past when language was purer."
Another complaint simply reads: "One line was about whipping someone's toosh."
The full list of complaints can be read at governmentattic.com
MOROVIS, Puerto Rico‚ÄîThe loud buzzing of portable gasoline electric generators has become the norm in this central mountainous region of the battered territory.
It's been that way for more than three months, ever since Hurricane Maria knocked out 100 percent of electricity on the island of 3.4 million people. Today almost half the island is without power. It's the longest blackout in American history and will not be over soon because of a shortage of supplies to fix the electrical grid.
‚ÄúThe materials are arriving but at a really slow pace. Sadly, we are hardly working,‚Äù said a lineman who preferred not to be identified. ‚ÄúIn the meantime, we try to reuse whatever materials that can be found onsite which are rusty and unreliable.‚Äù
The lineman is one of about 27,000 other workers who were brought in from the mainland to help restore the power grid. Without supplies though, repair brigades are seen roaming the streets without much to do.
‚ÄúI can count with one hand the times we've seen brigades work in our streets,‚Äù said Carmen Maldonado, mayor of Morovis, a municipality of 33,000 people. ‚ÄúThe economy has plummeted, our elders are in need of medical care, and schools are barely operating.‚Äù
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is in charge of restoring electricity, but it claims it is hampered by a lack of supplies. ‚ÄúPuerto Rico is competing for supplies with Texas and Florida, whose electrical grids were similarly ravaged by hurricanes,‚Äù said Army Corps spokesperson Luciano Riviera.
Only 9,100 transmission posts out of the 52,000 needed have arrived so far, Rivera said. The most recent shipment came last week, they said, adding that 8,100 posts are scheduled to arrive every two weeks starting next week.
That means all the necessary supplies to restore power won't arrive until March.
Maldonado's hopes were set on Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello's goal to restore power to 95 percent of the commonwealth by the Dec. 15, a goal that was not met. Power generation on the island is at 65 percent. This does not mean 65 percent of the island has electricity as the transmission lines that supply generation to people's homes have not been restored due to the lack of materials and terrain challenges.
Municipalities such as Maunabo, Yabucoa, and Naguabo are also left completely pitch black every night as they remain without any energy.
‚ÄúMy people are the verge of a collapse,‚Äù said Aguas Buenas Mayor Javier Garcia. The municipality has about 28,000 inhabitants and the only facilities energized are the police headquarters, fire department, and a hospital.
‚ÄúWe are simply forgotten,‚Äù Garcia said, adding that the system is so fragile they decided to ditch the energy provided by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, or PREPA, and rely on power generators.
‚ÄúI don't know who to trust anymore. Week after week, [PREPA and the Army Corps] say that they will send brigades our way but they never show up. We have not seen a single brigade in the past 93 days,‚Äù Garcia said, adding that he's never felt so helpless in their life, seeing as locals have run out of money to buy fuel for their generators.
Garcia's cry for help comes at a time when the Army Corps, which is leading the federal power restoration on the island, reported that recovery efforts are more advanced in the U.S. Virgin Islands than in Puerto Rico.
The Army Corps revealed that it has only completed 34 percent of the awnings needed to temporarily repair homes in Puerto Rico, in contrast to the Virgin Islands, where it has achieved 100 percent.
In addition, the Army Corps said it's reached 99 percent of the installation of the portable power generators needed to power critical areas in the Virgin Islands; in Puerto Rico, it stands at 76 percent.
Over the summer, designer and blogger Nickolay Lamm re-envisioned New York's skyline such that the height of buildings represented the wealth of the people who inhabited them.
The art was striking, and exposed the city's vast inequalities. ‚ÄúI feel a lot of people look at New York's skyline and think, ‚Äòthat's where dreams happen, that's where dreams are made,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúI wanted to recreate the skyline to show dreams can happen there, but it's not as easy as it seems.‚Äù
Lamm has just come out with a new set of illustrations visualizing inequality for several other cities, including Chicago, Boston, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Chicago
Here's how their visualization of income inequality works: If one section of a city had a net worth for example of $500,000, the height of the green 3D bar shape for that section is 5 cm. If one section had a net worth of $112,000, the height for that section is smaller at 1.12 cm. Lamm's method reveals striking divides within cities. In their visualization of Chicago above, for instance, one can see wealth clustered along the shore of Lake Michigan and in the suburbs to the west, but not in between. Here's another map by Lamm that shows the same phenomenon. The dark green areas represent those areas with the highest wealth, similar to the soaring green bars in the previous image.
Compare the image above with the map below of race in Chicago, created by Eric Fisher based on 2010 Census data.
In the map of race, each dot equals 25 residents ‚Äî a red dot is 25 white residents, a blue dot is 25 black residents, green is asian, orange is hispanic, yellow is ‚Äúother.‚Äù When comparing the two maps, we can see that the orange areas on Lamm's map of Chicago ‚Äî representing their lowest bars ‚Äî are in primarily black and Latino neighborhoods identified on Fisher's map.
While income inequality may be invisible, our cities have very real divides along other observable lines. Still, these disparities go unaddressed.
‚ÄúIt's not meant to be a depressing project,‚Äù Lamm says. Instead, Lamm says they want to increase awareness of a major urban problem. ‚ÄúA few of the most powerful people in these cities say that everything is fair. They do that to keep people settled down. The ones who promote the American dream the most are the ones who really don't care about it ‚Äî they're promoting it to save their own self interests.‚Äù

With the recent news of MS losing money for the first time ever, people assume that Microsoft is tanking, that it's starting its slow descent to hell right beside RIM. I'm sure investors are getting scared, the stocks are dropping but you know what? I'm pretty damn excited about Microsoft and what it's doing. There are so many things that I'm looking forward to as far MS goes this year and I'll definitely be dropping money their way.
Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not a MS diehard fanboy that gushes over anything that Microsoft comes out with, no at all. I'm a huge linux advocate, I love open source, I use Chrome instead of Internet Explorer, I've worked with Macs, I do have a certain respect for Apple, and I think having stuff cross-platform is important as hell. As a background for my Microsoft/Windows experience, I've been on it since W95 and on a previous DOS iteration. I've always had a ‚ÄúPC‚Äù laptop or a desktop. I'm a gamer and a developer. There you go. Anyways, let's move on.
What microsoft is doing now is pretty interesting. They're revamping their identity, their priorities, their base designs, and their entire philosophy. And they actually have a TON of great products out there, and will have more. Here's what I'm talking about.
Microsoft Metro UI
I'm not talking about just Windows 8 base UI, I'm talking about the whole concept and how they're applying it to everywhere from phones to tablets, to Xbox and so on. What makes it so intersting is that you longer have a notification bar, start button, app dock, or whatever else that is common to desktop UI. They basically erased the conventions that even (yes) Apple follows (to some extent). You have a pseudo phone interface, pseudo tablet interface, that will work on any-sized device, probably even a watch or a big-ass TV. The idea is really awesome because it's all there and it's accessible, it's very differently. Every application is distraction free and every time you get to your homescreen, you have something to look forward to and everything right there. That was the appeal of Windows Phone 7. You open your phone and you have FB notifications, Twitter, Weather etc. right there without tacky widgets.
Non-Imitative Design
This one is harder to explain but basically, Microsoft got rid of imitations in their design. The word for it is ‚ÄúSkeumorphism‚Äù. No longer do you have a ‚Äúglassy‚Äù UI, or plastic-like buttons, or leather-bound start menu or what have you. No brushed aluminum, no grunge, nothing. It's just color, typography, and icons (those are a bit of a Skeumorphist element but they are necessary). For some reason, this exact thing makes using the computer more enjoyable and think about it, the distraction-free, non-glossy environment is what's trending so much right now:
Distraction Free editors (such as FocusWriter, modified OpenOffice etc.) is what we want
Minimalist websites and apps
Information-driven applications
Microsoft prides itself on this evolutionary step toward better UI.
Microsoft Office 2013
Have you SEEN the Consumer Preview yet?? Well, look above, that's my installation. You'll notice a few things. First, I write crappy sci-fi üòâ Second, the UI! No more glossy ribbons. Office was often criticized for its overblown UI, its fancy things and many a writer has migrated toward FocusWriter, WriteMonkey, Ommwriter, and other editors due to the distracting UI. Here are the most important features that make me giddy about all this:
clean interface; however, I hope MS will do some polishing because that node-icon stuff up top is horrendous
the ‚ÄúMinimalist Editor‚Äù mode. In the top right, right next to to minimize and maximize buttons is a little screen-looking thing. This will eliminate all distractions and just place your writing in front of you.
New ‚ÄúFile‚Äù menu to die for. You get much more information. The UI is very metro-esque (makes sense) and you have the ability to open and save files DIRECTLY to your skydrive. This is like Google Docs on steroids. Think about it. You have the full-throttle power of MS Office, the huge expansive suite that has had a decade and a half to perfect itself, and now you have a service that connects you to the internet, seamlessly, without plugins or extras. You can OPEN and SAVE to skydrive.
Version management. This is like Git for word. Seriously. It synchronizes different versions, warns you about discrepancies and you always have access to an earlier version of the document.
Online and App integration. Want to edit your document on your laptop that's Word-less? Go online, use the Word application, and edit the file directly from there. w00t!
Ability to login
Let's talk about that last one in the next section.
Google-esque login to everywhere
Google login is awesome. Yep. Because you can login with it anywhere and integrate ALL of your services together. You got all of the Windows Essentials that run on it, your hotmail (if you use it), but then you have:
SkyDrive
Bing search
MS Office products ‚Äì sync with Skydrive, sync your SETTINGS, take it with you everywhere
Windows 8 ‚Äì sync your settings, your preferences, take it everywhere, instant settings (just like Google with Android)
Windows Phone
MS Essentials ‚Äì such as the messenger, I think Live Writer works with it, and so on. Also, live mesh
I'm thinking this will expand to where you'll be able to connect your 360 account with your Live account (maybe you already can) and so on. It's pretty awesome because just like Google allows sync between Chromes, you'll have sync between computers. The thing is, a lot of PC users have multiple PCs, like me, and it's very useful to just install Mesh and Skydrive or whatever else and have all your machines sync.
It's like Google but on a desktop üôÇ
Microsoft Surface
Okay, so the tablet looks like the most bad-ass one on the market (even my mom wants it). It's like the ASUS Transformer Prime (I actually might opt in for the prime) on steroids, on new MS steroids. The appeal of the Asus TP is the fact that it's a powerful small tablet and can instantly convert to a bad-ass laptop. A lot of people have been telling about how much they love it and honestly, I love the concept too.
I love MS Surface. You got an awesome tablet, and you have a cover that (miraculously) becomes a keyboard! Okay, it's not THAT revolutionary but it's a really decent idea, it's a great design and it ties in together with Metro. The tablet doesn't compete with the iPad either, and it doesn't try to hole out a new non-existent market. It aims itself at laptop users that don't want to carry the weight of a laptop but do want some of that tablet functionality. It aims itself at heavy PC users. It's a tablet for Windows. I know i'd use it more than the iPad especially with the live sync. With a keyboard on hand, I'll even write on it and do whatever I need to. I wouldn't really do that on an iPad.
To me, this feels like a comfortable mix between an Ultrabook and a tablet.
Other Software
Some stuff you probably don't know about is the dev software out there that gets updates. Here are just a few other things to get excited about:
new Visual Studio 2012 ‚Äì complete with the ability to code metro-style apps, browse code in your solution explorer, preview files in code editor, pin files that you use frequently, change your color scheme, search acoross the entire IDE, full HTML5 support, full ECMAScript 5 support (newest ‚Äújavascript‚Äù version), javascript intellisense, asynchronous coding for VB, VC# and more.

another read Outlook.com
and so much more
This is great news for ASP developers and since I work with ASP and C#, this is pretty cool.
Other Hardware
(in picture Windows Phone 7) I definitely forgot to mention some of these when initially discussing everything:
new Xbox
Windows Phone 8
Windows 8 and Windows 8 RT
And we come to the crowning glory that makes me so giddy about MS. W8. With Metro UI, with sync, with performance boosts. Let's just have a run down of what W8 is bringing with it. I've been following the Windows blog posts on the W8 development so I know quite a bit about it:
Touchscreen optimization
Tablet-like UI
Super fast booting
‚ÄúSystem Refresh‚Äù
Very amazing task manager
Dual UI ‚Äì Metro and ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù, both of which look really amazing and very different from Windows 7
Javascript/HTML/CSS apps for Metro that allow tablet-like/smartphone-like UI patterns like sharing, and so on
Less ram usage ‚Äì very streamlined
Windows Store ‚Äì we have Google Play, we have iTunes, and now we have a Windows Store. What's awesome about it is that I bet a ton of people will use it and it's much more exciting than anything else I can think of üôÇ
Split-screen ‚Äì different snapping, multiple apps, and so on.
Better multi-monitor support
Better file explorer ‚Äì supports ISO mounting, better UI and so on üôÇ
Account integration
‚ÄúWindows To Go‚Äù ‚Äì strange feature but basically it allows you to store your W8 programs, settings, and files on a USB drive so you can use it anywhere
USB3 support
support for ARM chips (for RTM as far as I know)
server-like virtualization (Hyper-V)
and much more.
Not excited yet? Just wait till it comes out.
Internet Explorer 10
Ooooh, just opened a can of worms. Maybe not. Here's what's happening. MS realized how much of a shitty job they were doing with their browsers and stepped their game up for IE9 and for a while it held up pretty well until the rapid release cycles of Chrome and FF took off. MS has been working closely with W3C and has been a huge supporter of standards and the new IE10 looks amazing.
I'm excited about it üòâ
Pricing
Everything expensive is now cheap and affordable. Windows 8 upgrade? No more $500 price tags, it's $50 or so. They adopted the Apple model in that aspect even though Apple comes out with upgrades TOO often while MS comes out with something every 4 years.
The downside here is that Microsoft will probably lose a ton of money, and I feel bad for them because they do come out with a new OS ever 4 years and Apple comes out every year (with sometimes minor upgrades) so the model seems to be ass-backward. It works for consumers though.
Office has a subscription model and cheaper pricing for corporations. It's pretty tight. Again, this is the largest source of revenue for Microsoft and they're battling Google here. Hopefully, consumers will win out with the best product üôÇ
Rebranding
Microsoft has undergone the most massive rebrand it has in the past 20 years. Seriously. From Windows ditching its eternal waving flag to actual ‚Äúwindows‚Äù, to Hotmail/Live ditching its hotmail/live (whatever it was) branding for outlook, to finally, the Microsoft logo itself:
If you check out the rest of Microsoft's new products, you'll see a similar, very intuitive, pattern of branding. It's EXTREMELY coherent, simplistic, and beautiful. Enjoy! üôÇ
Conclusion
So yeah, quite a lot to be excited about and I think MS really reinvented itself in the past few years and this year is when we'll see the fruits of that reinvention from great UI, to better UX, to cheaper prices and an overall overhaul of business strategy on Microsoft's part.

THE Royal Botanic Garden is to be analysed for signs of pixies and elves after claims that supernatural spirits live in the grounds.
Paranormal experts will visit the site in Edinburgh over the next two weeks with sensitive equipment in an attempt to detect if there really are fairies at the bottom of the garden.
The move follows an account of elves, fauns and even a centaur being seen by scientist Robert Ogilvie Crombie.
They claimed to have had conversations with spirits in and around the Botanics and wrote about their experiences in the book The Gentleman and the Faun.
Now their theories will be tested by paranormal expert Ron Halliday and medium Gary Gray.
Their experiment marks the 40th anniversary of Crombie's death. They had abandoned their career in science in the early 20th century due to ill health.
Ron, of Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, said: ‚ÄúI want to see if there is any foundation to these experiences. Is there something about the gardens themselves? Is there a strange energy there that could explain what Crombie says they saw?
‚ÄúCrombie was well respected at the time, and they said they encountered a variety of nature spirits and had conversations with them. They even claimed they took one of them home.
‚ÄúWhy would they say such a thing? We aim to find out.‚Äù
Born in Edinburgh in 1899, Crombie ‚Äì who became better known as ROC ‚Äì studied maths and science.
It was in the early 1960s at the age of 63 when they claimed to have had a remarkable encounter with a faun called Kurmos, who introduced them to Pan, a magical spirit, at the Royal Botanic Garden.
Crombie says they were welcomed into a world of mystical creatures, including fairies, and they reported their conversations at length.
In one encounter with Pan, they said they talked about people being jealous of their abilities.
Pan is reported to have told him: ‚ÄúCommunicating with my subjects is not a garden game for the odd half-hour when there is nothing better to do. It is of vital importance for the
survival of humankind.
‚ÄúUnless humanity comes to realise the dangerous stupidity of outraging nature and stops the ever-increasing rate of pollution it will ultimately destroy itself.‚Äù
Crombie went on to establish the Findhorn Foundation, a spiritual eco-village, in Moray.
Ron said: ‚ÄúROC was a remarkable guy and it will be fascinating to see if they picked up on some kind of energy within the Botanics, or had an ability to sense a spiritual force.
‚ÄúI'll be taking my dowsing rods, which are very sensitive to this kind of energy, and Gary will be using their own ability to see into other worlds.
‚ÄúWe're both hoping something is going on there.‚Äù
When a franchise is as loved as Star Trek is then you know there will be be an enormous amount of merchandise out there to tempt fans to part with their hard earned cash. Some of these items are pretty cool and it's clear a lot of time and care has gone into creating them, but others?...Well...not so much!We've gathered up some of the strangest, most bizarre Star Trek cash-ins that have appeared on the shelves over the last 49 years. I have to say, I love Trek as much as the next man, but I'm not sure I'd be investing in any of these...In Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Captain Spock brought a "marshmellon" dispenser with them while camping at Yosemite National Park, so they could roast a marshmallow over a fire with a stick. Not wanting to miss out on a clear marketing opportunity Kraft Co. sold replicas of Spock's marshmallow dispenser for their Kraft "Jet-Puffed" marshmallows.I'm not sure there is any evidence that spork's are the utensil of choice on board the Enterprise, but never let that stop someone makes a quick buck. Presumably someone thought Spock sounds a bit like spork, and voila - ch-ching. Your very own Star Trek spork will set you back $19.99, alternatively you can get a free plastic one from KFC.You know those people who buy a plot on the moon or name a star after a loved one? Suddenly they don't seem so silly. You see, the moon exists (I know it does, I've just checked out the window), and those stars might well be dead but they shine up there in the sky. However, and I'm sorry to burst some of your bubbles here, Vulcan is entirely made up! So why anyone would pay $39.99 for a plot of land on the imaginary planet is beyond me.I can only assume this isan officially licensed product! Commander Spock administers the first ever Vulcan Breast Meld. Ladies, you'll be needing a drink after that.You remember that time when Spock went skydiving out of the Enterprise airlock? No, me neither.'Tis the season and all that, so if the Vulcan Nerve Pinch isn't enough to crack your walnuts open then try the Vulcan Nut Cracker."Search for hidden metal as though you were exploring an alien planet"... or the beach!Part of me thinks this is really cool, but that's the kid in me that would've gotten beaten for dressing like Spock and combing the beach with an Enterprise shaped metal detector.For when you've boldly gone.Made to resemble Spock's torpedo casket which they were shot out into space in during Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Whether it also means you'll be revived via the Genesis Project is unclear.At last you can finally pretend to be Captain Picard. Now, every time you walk into the room you can say "lights!" and your lights will turn on. "Lights off" not surprisingly turns the lights off, and "dim lights" does exactly what you'd think. It even includes samples of the actual Enterprise's computer voice (Majel Barrett) to respond to your commands.Or you could just flick the lights on yourself.I like a good genre mash-up as much as the next guy, but... really?This bit of madness came out in 1994, presumably in the hope to cash in on the fanbase of both franchises, but I don't think it's doing either one any favours. The most bizarre thing about this is that the Turtles seem to have sprouted heads full of hair!...I wonder if there was a range planned featuring the Enterprise crew wearing turtle shells and eating pizza?Now that I would've bought!Thank you to everyone who commented and e-mailed to mention that this list just couldn't be complete without this item...Remco were one of the first companies to produce licensed toys for the Star Trek franchise, and this item is an almost exact replica of the helmet worn by Spock in the TOS episode "Spock's Magical Space Fun Helmet".You remember that episode, right? It was when Spock's brain started leaking out of their ear and they were becoming all illogical and stuff. So Captain Kirk had a special helmet produced to contain their logic and stuff. Spock then forgot their name so they wrote it on their head with one of them thick Sharpies, and stuff like that with a flashing light and antenna. Yeah, sure, you remember? Right?.....and then JJ Abrams paid tribute to it in a deleted scene from Star Trek Into Darkness......turns out Spock's brain leak was the source of all the lens flare! Who knew?OK, so clearly none of that is true. It seems that all Remco did to produce this product was dig out some old helmet and write the word Spock on it.Ch-ching!
On Wednesday night, Earl Sweatshirt and Lionel Boyce became one. They were no longer the Odd Future MC behind the incredible Doris album, and the twisted mind that co-created and stars in Adult Swim's Loiter Squad. Nay, they morphed into DJ Billy Jole, and SPIN was there to witness the transformation. It happened at Haus of Strauss, the annual Levi's party that takes place between Coachella weekends at the spacious Levi's Haus in Hollywood. The ‚ÄúDJ tandem‚Äù (don't call ‚Äòem a duo) wore excess amounts of acid wash and rocked headsets in stark contrast to the space's dark wooden floors and animal-skin rugs. And if you ask them how their debut performance went, there is only one possible answer.
They won.
But how much did they win over the course of the evening? DJ Billy Jole started their night finalizing their playlist and launching a Twitter account. They had a drink named after them, albeit erroneously (sip the ‚ÄúBilly Joel Buzz‚Äù). They opened for R&B insider/outsider Solange and Big Boi from the freshly reunited OutKast (also DJing). And their set ‚Äî which included selections from Black Sabbath, R. Kelly, and Juelz Santana, to name a few ‚Äî was assisted by Tyler, the Creator, who, wearing a cowboy hat and matching Levi's acid-washed denim, coerced the clearly star-struck and motionless attendees into dancing. The barrages of gunshots, air horns, and sirens also helped.
And when Sweatshirt shouted out at the crowd, ‚ÄúWe don't care. We actually don't care,‚Äù they could be seen beaming ear to ear. Odd Future co-manager Christian Clancy declared DJ Billy Jole's inaugural performance an ‚Äúunbelievable success,‚Äù because it was. But before DJ Billy Jole hit the decks, SPIN sat down with Earl and Lionel to discuss their brief but illustrious career thus far, and to find out what the future holds for two men (one tandem) who are absolutely incapable of losing.
Who or what is DJ Billy Jole?
Earl Sweatshirt: Pretty much a collaborative effort toward eliminating losers.
Lionel Boyce: We DJ parties and we don't lose. Two things you need to know about us.
Are you big Billy Joel fans?
Sweatshirt: No. I've never heard a Billy Joel song.
Boyce: Nah. Not even once.
You haven't heard ‚ÄúPiano Man?‚Äù
Sweatshirt: I've heard ‚ÄúPiano Man.‚Äù That song is pretty cool.
Boyce: That's a cool song. That's chill.
If you're not Billy Joel fans, then how and why did you choose the name?
Sweatshirt: We walked around introducing ourselves to people and it just fucking stuck. It sold itself. You put a name like that on someone and they're fucking tantalized, they're eating out of the palm of your hand. Nine times out of 10 ‚Äî every time.
Boyce: Power moves.
Will you record together under the DJ Billy Jole name?
Sweatshirt: We don't want to close any doors for ourselves. We're just kind of leaning into the whole DJ thing.
How long have you two been DJing?
Sweatshirt: We started putting together playlists in the car. Roughly two and a half hours.
Boyce: That's how long we've been a DJ tandem.
Sweatshirt: No, we've been a DJ tandem for some months now.
Will you curate a DJ Billy Jole mixtape at some point?
Sweatshirt: I think there's a tour.
Boyce: There might be a tour. Worldwide tour.
Sweatshirt: I think there's 100 percent a tour, actually. Billy Jole is in your city fucking shit up.
Boyce: Every city.
Sweatshirt: Doing your party.
Boyce: Every party.
Sweatshirt: And not losing.
Boyce: Never. Period.
What kind of music do you see yourselves spinning?
Sweatshirt: Party.
Boyce: Every music.
Sweatshirt: Every party.
Boyce: We don't limit ourselves. We don't put ourselves in a box. That's not what we do around here. We just get up and play that music for as long as they need us to.
If that's the case, where have DJ Billy Jole played before?
Boyce and Sweatshirt: [Hysterical laughter.] Nowhere.
What's a song you might play that many people wouldn't know?
Sweatshirt: Ghost Town DJs' ‚ÄúMy Boo.‚Äù Psyche! That's the fake song for you, that you can tell people.
Boyce: We can't let you know what that is. You just have to listen to the music, to the rhythm.
If the dance floor seems dead, what are some songs you might play to get the crowd hyped again?
Sweatshirt: ‚ÄúWar Pigs‚Äù by Black Sabbath.
Boyce: Gospel music.
Sweatshirt: Really recent gospel. Not like good, old soulful gospel; like 2004 electronic, weird, and really bad gospel.
Who are some artists that you, as a DJ tandem, both enjoy?
Sweatshirt: Black Sabbath, Prince, El DeBarge, Dru Hill, early Alicia Keys.
Boyce: Back when they had the braids. I like a lot of Brandy. I call them Moesha.
Sweatshirt: Yeah, braids Alicia Keys. Who else? Mario.
Boyce: German industrial.
Do you like Kraftwerk?
Sweatshirt: Nah. Just German industrial.
Are there any German industrial artists that come to mind?
Boyce: Hookska. [Editor's note: This isn't a real artist.] I love their music.
Will you use Serato or‚Ä¶
Boyce: This [iPad] right here. This is all we need.
One iPad for the two of you.
Sweatshirt: We didn't have it in our budget to get another one.
How long does it take you to put together a playlist?
Sweatshirt: We're still putting it together. We'll probably still be putting it together during the set. I'm going to be completely honest, this could be a complete train wreck. But the beauty of it is that whether we go out there and fucking kill it or whether it's a complete mess, we fucking killed it ‚Äî thesis of the night.
Boyce: [Touches headset.] There's no one on the phone.
Sweatshirt: I'm not talking to anyone. This is not connected.
What's the next step for DJ Billy Jole after tonight?
Sweatshirt: The fucking road, bro. And probably not lose some more.
Boyce: Just go out and do more parties, focus on not losing.
What would be ‚Äúlosing‚Äù for you guys?
Boyce: I don't know. I've never seen losing. That doesn't make sense.
Sweatshirt: That's a pretty foreign concept to me.
What is the DJ Billy Jole definition of winning?
Sweatshirt: Can I ask you something? [Gestures to jeans and jacket.] Have you taken a look over here?
How did you decide on the headsets?
Sweatshirt: Bro, you just know. It just made sense. If you're going to the beach, you need a towel. We're going to do a party and we're not losing ‚Äî Brick, I need a headset.
Boyce: Two of them.
Where do you see DJ Billy Jole in five years?
Sweatshirt: Tour, top of the world, billionaires.
Boyce: Billionaires.
Sweatshirt: Probably dangerous animal owners. Definitely. No questions asked.
Boyce: Still in acid wash for sure. Still not losing.
Yes, it's changed publishers and been delayed a few times, but South Park: The Stick of Truth still exists, and it still looks amazing.
Here are some new screenshots from the Obsidian-developed RPG, which is written by the show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Originally slated for last year (and then earlier this year) as a THQ game, South Park: The Stick of Truth was purchased by Ubisoft when THQ went bankrupt back in January.
No release date just yet, but it'll be at E3 next week.

UPDATE: Ubisoft has asked us to take down a screenshot they sent us of Cartman farting. Here's the e-mail we just got from them:
Hi, Sorry about this, but can we please remove the Cartman farting image from all coverage as it has not been approved by ESRB. Apologize for the hassle and appreciate your understanding.

We get it. The ESRB can be tough. So we've censored the image, for Ubisoft's convenience:
The Abandoned Homes of HellHole Canyon are the Devils Den
Posted on Feb 6, 2014 in photography
‚ÄúYou don't want to go down that road there‚Äù they advised us as we rolled down our window of the truck, ‚Äúthe guy down there has a shotgun and you'll find yourselves in trouble‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou best stick to the main roads‚Äù. When we inquired about the ‚Äúabandoned and derelict‚Äù homes that we had read about in Hidden San Diego, they claimed to have ‚Äúnever heard of any such place‚Äù even though we suspected it was less than a mile away and they appeared to be a long-time local.
30 minutes later we were heading up Calle De Encinas Ct when we rolled down our window to ask a couple walking by about this mysterious old commune that we heard was in the area. We asked if there were ‚ÄúAbandoned Homes‚Äù in the area one of them quickly spoke up, ‚ÄúOh No. You haven't heard? That was a big scam. There are no abandoned homes. Whatever you read on the internet or the San Diego Reader was a lie‚Äù.
We ended up leaving Calle De Encinas Ct against our own hunches and drove all the way to HellHole Canyon Preserve thinking that was the best trail to start our exploration. The Rangers there had never heard of any such place at all.
I certainly was getting more intrigued by the minute. Whatever was around here, the locals really didn't want us exploring the area but these were public trails so we were determined to keep up our search.
What the Hell is HellHole?
You can read the whole story of the Bloody Massacre of HellHole Canyon right here, but as legend has it HellHole got its name in 1870. Maria Sutter, a woman of German descent, who lived on Paradise Mountain, reportedly gave Hellhole its name when they looked down from their home at the top of the mountain and said of the canyon below, ‚ÄúIt's good for nothing, and in the summer it's hot as you know where!‚Äù
HellHole is not a particular canyon, rather it is a geographic location and its hot. Hot as Hell in the summer as far as I can tell from everything I had read about it.
HellHole is located in Valley Center, east of Escondido. If you're going to venture out there, you best do it in the winter like we did when it was actually quite pleasant and spring like. The people there like their privacy and they move there to get away from the city as far as I can tell.
HellHole Canyon is actually a pretty nice place to hike and explore but It's very hot in the summer.
We Had Read Reports of Abandoned Homes from an Old Hippy Commune
We were originally intrigued by Hellhole because of this article that appeared in one of my favorite blogs called Hidden San Diego and you can read the post here. These guys search all the coolest places for you to explore in San Diego and this one was at the top of the list in terms of being remote and kind of unknown. Its an extremely useful site for local San Diegan's looking to explore off the beaten path locations. In any case, we were on the hunt to find these abandoned homes.
Finally, We Locate a Promising TrailHead That We Believed Would Lead There
After about an hour of hunting around, we eventually located what we believed to be the trailhead. It looked like the pictures we had seen of the location. The Trail starts off the very dead end of Calle De Encinas Ct We were on the trail and I was making detailed notes and taking pictures every step of the way in case we needed to back trace later.
The trail was a bit confusing at first and you could get lost but there were lots of random markers that lead us to believe we were on the right track.
We also used our iPhones to keep gravitating towards the place where Google Maps showed the old broken down homes.
After 1.2 Miles Walking We Arrive at a Beautiful Oasis
After about 30 minutes of walking we finally came upon it. We saw broken down shacks and trailers homes sitting in a shady meadow with a creek running right through it. I guess what was most surprising was the tranquil setting and the fact it was calm and quiet. I could see why a hippie commune might have setup in this place. It seemed quiet pleasant.
The tranquil view you come upon as you locate the homes.
An old motor home is stuck in a ditch, it never made it into the commune.
We could have stayed here for hours enjoying the beautiful area
A Devils Den
Upon closure exploration however all didn't seem quite right with this place. Retracing through the commune things looked a bit more sinister. Did the devil find work for idle hands here in the middle of this HellHole oasis ? Take for example the first abandoned graffiti-scrawled abandoned shack we found ‚Äì it appeared to be a meth lab of some sort.
This is the first derelict property you will notice as you enter the compound.
Inside we found old chemical compound jugs, a bathtub, gloves, gas mask and yellow protective suits. This was Walter White Season 1 Breaking Bad stuff.
I've seen enough Breaking Bad episodes to know that Gas Mask are used in the cooking process.
And this is the bath tub that they used to decompose bodies probably. Notice the yellow overalls, there were about 5 pairs in this shack.
Old Trashed Homes, Trailers, and A Devils Heap of Oddities
Surely this place had been occupied by a fairly large group. There were lots of homes and judging from some of the furnishings left out, I would have to imagine that these homes hadn't been occupied for at least 10 years. They've been sitting out here in the middle of nowhere slowly rotting like an old Ghost Town.
There was an electric pole down here. All the wires have been pulled out.
The place is strewn with trash, and lots of old washers. An inordinate number of old washers in this commune.
Obviously there must have been young babies here.
Remember that radio missing out of your old Ford Escort back in 1989? I think we found it. You can pick it up if you want it back
The Hills Have Eyes
When you come to The Devils Den in Hellhole you get that creepy feeling that you are being watched. I am not sure if we were but it sure felt like we were never really alone. At one point not far from us we heard a pack of wild Coyotes start screaming. It sounded a little too close for comfort. I grabbed a stick for protection which I carried for the rest of the trip.
We got that creepy feeling we were being watched. Every so often we would hear a branch or leaves rustle off in the distance.
The oddities here were sometimes mesmerizing, sometimes alarming
What happened here? Why did everyone leave so suddenly?
Most of the old homes and trailers still had food (mostly cans inside). It is bizarre that people just picked up and walked off. Was this a meth lab that was broken up and people forced to leave? Was there some event that caused people to abandon their homes?
Do people still live here? Were they out for the day and we just happened to be rummaging through their homes?
This place was actually quite dangerous, the broken glass and the floors on most homes could cave in or crack. You have to be careful
This scene reminded me of the movie, Into to The Wild where the guy goes to live off the grid, and later perishes.
There are lots of cans of foods. The rats, raccoons and coyotes have not figured out how to open them up yet.
Why Would Someone Come Here?
I am pretty sure you might be curious why anyone would even want to go here. Well, for starters it's a cool place to explore while hiking. And also it's kind of quirky adventure to take for half a day. It's part of San Diego so I am always looking for cool new places to explore.
Finally I guess it makes a pretty cool backdrop for movies and or photos. It's not hard to imagine that someone might want to come out here to take pictures like we did. I highly doubt this place will still be accessible in a few years. Someone will put a fence up or block access or maybe they just won't want people coming down here.
In any case, its open today and there are absolutely no signs anywhere that this is private property or the public is not allowed so it doesn't seem like you would be breaking any laws.
If you want to see the full gallery of pictures you can see it here ‚Äì Devils Den HellHole Canyon.
Members of Associated Students of University of California, Riverside (ASUCR) voted unanimously last week to call on university administration to warn students via email prior to what were called ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù or ‚Äútriggering‚Äù pro-life demonstrations on campus.
The University of California, Riverside (UCR) Highlander states:
Various organizations have continually expressed disapproval of the demonstrations organized by pro-life organizations such as Students for Life, which has invited pro-life groups on campus in the past. Because of the potentially offensive and triggering nature of such displays, Senator Summer Shafer introduced a resolution which calls for emails to be sent to the entire student body ‚Äúwarning them that Students for Life, or any other organization that fosters a similar environment, such as the Center for Bioethical Reform, will be present.
ASUCR's resolution reportedly described a Students for Life display on November 6 as ‚Äúemotionally triggering‚Äù and ‚Äúnot conducive to a positive academic environment.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe're not asking these groups to not come on campus. ‚Ä¶ We're just asking that a warning be sent out,‚Äù said Devin Plazo, president pro tempore, about the resolution, which calls for university administration to distribute ‚Äútrigger warning emails‚Äù to students. Until the university administration takes on the task, student Fernando Echeverria, vice president of Internal Affairs, will assume the role of sending out the warnings.
Breitbart News spoke with Casey Tesauro, national college program coordinator for Students for Life of America (SFLA), who said that the ASUCR's targeting of SFLA groups is based on a false account of the pro-life group's November 6 display.
‚ÄúSFLA brought our ‚ÄòWe Care' display on campus, which basically has stick figures delineating a man, woman, and baby,‚Äù Tesauro said. ‚ÄúHow is that ‚Äògraphic,' especially when the pro-choice groups came out with coat hangers as part of their display?‚Äù
They noted that the pro-choice group protested SFLA that day with a megaphone.
Tesauro said that ASUCR approved its resolution after SFLA's display, which was clearly not ‚Äúgraphic.‚Äù Mid-morning, prior to SFLA's appearance, the following email was sent out by Echeverria of ASUCR:
To the Campus Community: There is a display scheduled for the campus that has pictures and language pertaining to sexual violence and abortion that could be triggering to individuals Location: Next to the Bell Tower on the Watkins Lawn‚Äì Beginning at 11:00 a.m. today Resource Guide Here is a list of some of the places you can contact for support. You will also find more information on their websites. Womens Resource Center: 951-827-3337 LGBT Resource Center: 951-827-2267 The Resource Centers offer a support system, ways to speak out, events, information about options, as well as a safe space. There are even more resources on their websites, in more depth for survivors. Counseling Center: 951-UCR-TALK UCR offers 8 free counseling sessions, as well as further support in regards to mental health. Rape Crisis Center: 952-686-RAPE This is a 24 hour hotline and is an off-campus resource. Title IX: 951-827-7070 The Title IX Officer will inform you of your rights and options as student. The Well: 951-837-9355 The Well can provide health resources and stress relievers. This message has been sent to you from the Associated Students, UC Riverside. Fernando Echeverria University of California Riverside B.A Theatre/Political Science, Class of 2016 2014-15 Vice President of Campus Internal Affairs University of California, Riverside, 202 Highlander Union Building Riverside, CA 92521 (951) 827-3621
‚ÄúWe don't want our students to be targeted or bullied and we don't want them to have to submit to procedures other students don't have to submit to,‚Äù said Tesauro. ‚ÄúOur goal is not to ‚Äòtrigger' people but to let men and women know they have another choice.‚Äù
‚Äú'We Care' is our program. We want people who have been sexually assaulted to know they have another place to contact,‚Äù they added. ‚ÄúWe wanted to have more discussion, rather than protest of our position.‚Äù
Breitbart News attempted to contact UCR several times, by phone and email, including Laurie Sinclair, executive director for ASUCR, and Joe Virata, assistant dean of students, but received no return calls or contact.
According to the Highlander, citing the First Amendment, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Jim Sandoval expressed some concern about ASUCR's resolution and the decision to send out ‚Äútrigger‚Äù or ‚Äúwarning‚Äù emails.
‚ÄúThe university is always very careful to refrain from communications related to any expressions of speech on campus,‚Äù Sandoval said, recommending the language of the ‚Äúwarning‚Äù emails ‚Äúbe as neutral as possible ‚Ä¶ and not (make) a commentary on the content (of the demonstrations).‚Äù
Nevertheless, Sandoval promised that administration would ‚Äúdo (their) best to get a letter out to the student body.

I've always wanted to create a tarot deck based on my own drawings. It was a little difficult to pin down exactly what kind of style, but I decided on the strange and monstrous.
Death: from concept to completion. You can also see my sketch of "The Hanged Man!"
I'm also really interested in the occult (in fact, some of my favorite games are heavily influenced by it!), so the cards reflect some supernatural elements. And, of course, it still needs to be readable, so I also drew inspiration from the famous Rider-Waite deck.
Thus, the ACACIA TAROT was born!

Competition to get under way in Australia and New Zealand
As the holidays come to a close, competition is set to get started. For those in Australia and New Zealand, your chance to prove your mettle is coming.
On January 30-31, ANZHeroes.com will be hosting the Summer Showdown Series, a two-day event for players and teams within Australia and New Zealand. As of this announcement the prize pool stands at $250 with the chance of that number increasing closer to the date.
The plan is for these tournaments to be a monthly occurance, with teams also playing for points that will go towards a regional ranking.
The presence of Heroes of the Storm within this region is not too pronounced, with a reasonably limited player base and few competitive opportunities. As more tournaments such as these popping up that may start to change over time and the scene may be able to produce teams that could compete on the international stage as Immunity was able to do last year.
For more information about the Summer Showdown Series and how to sign up, head over to ANZHeroes.com
Follow us on Twitter @GosuGamersHotS for more esports news.
QUICKPOLL Given another year of growth and competition, do you think ANZ teams could be competitive in International events? It may take time but sure!
Thank you for voting! Nah, it will remain a lower tier region.
Thank you for voting!
NEW DELHI: When the horrors of the Second world war left thousands of Polish children orphaned in 1942, Jam Saheb Maharaja of Nawanagar, a princely state in Gujarat, welcomed them with warmth and offered them shelter.He built a camp near the Balachadi seaside estate, where the children not only regained their physical strength, but also rediscovered their lost childhoods.To document this lesser known story of benevolence, Polish director Tomas Stankiewicz is making a documentary that offers to tell the extraordinary story of the Second World War children refugee camp in Gujarat.Titled, "Brave Brunch in India", the story is being told through the perspective of two children -- an 11-year-old Polish boy and the nine-year-old daughter of the Maharaja.The narrative is based on the first-hand accounts of an 80-year-old Polish man, who was around 17 when they spent their days in the Maharaja's camp."This was in the middle of the war. The children who came to India recovered from whatever they went through in Russia "There was a school for them, they sang and danced and were given full freedom to practise their own religion," Monika Kowaleczko-Szumowska, one of the producers of the film, said.Szumowska added that building the film around a single person's narrative ensured it was short yet impactful.The creators have decided to make the film in an online interactive format. "We want children to use it as an educational tool," they said.The production also takes into account the period after the war was over, and the children had grown up.In 1945, when Poland was on its way to become a communist country controlled by the Soviets, the country wanted its children to be sent back. But, many of them were unwilling to leave India. So, the Maharaja decided to adopt them."The children stayed in India for 5 years. Whosoever was under 18 at that time was adopted by the Maharaja, a polish priest and a British officer. They adopted nearly 200 kids," Szumowska said.The documentary takes from an earlier film "BraveBunch: The Uprising through Children's Eyes", which was about the Warsaw Uprising of 1944. It talked about the 63-day-long heroic struggle to liberate Warsaw, the Polish capital, from Nazi Germany occupation during the Second World War."Brave Brunch in India" is scheduled to be launched in October 2018.The project will also include a book, which is expected to be translated in Hindi and other regional languages.Szumowska said it was one of the greatest stories of that time as it cemented warm relations between Europeans and Indians."It is an important event of the history because a lot of Europeans needed help and India extended them support. It showcases the beautiful character and spirit of the people here. But unfortunately it was kept as a secret in Poland due to communism. And when we came to India we realised it was not well known here either. I think it is important to talk about it at least now," they said.
Hoosiers forced 21 turnovers in weekend win. Can they keep it up vs. Penn State?

BLOOMINGTON ‚Äî If Tom Crean knew it would be so easy, they might have tried it weeks ago.
Speaking on their pregame radio show Sunday, Indiana's basketball coach addressed a number of keys to success against Rutgers, the Big Ten's last-place team. Among them: force more turnovers, a persistent problem all season.
So Indiana forced 21 turnovers, including 14 steals, an IU best under Crean in a conference game. The idea of it all starting with a radio show comment is admittedly tongue-in-cheek, but the performance certainly registered.
‚ÄúWe wanted to be active,‚Äù Crean said postgame. ‚ÄúNo question about it. We wanted to set the tone with the defense, and we thought we did that.‚Äù
Competition is worth taking into account ‚Äî Rutgers is currently 270th nationally in turnover rate. But so too is Indiana's now months-long fight against defensive regression, a multi-faceted problem that has marked the Hoosiers' backslide from the national top 10 to the NCAA tournament bubble.
In November, Indiana defeated Kansas and North Carolina in part because of defense, whether it be running the Jayhawks off the 3-point line or shutting down Joel Berry II, the Tar Heels' lead guard.
Since then, the decline in defensive consistency has marked nearly every one of IU's poor results, from Butler to Nebraska to Louisville to Wisconsin. It has manifested itself in a number of areas, with points per possession allowed sinking to 0.99 currently.
In Big Ten games alone, the Hoosiers are allowing 1.096 points per possession, ninth in the league.
It's commonplace to couple that decline with IU's persistent turnover problems, ill-timed giveaways too often leading to good looks in transition, where the Hoosiers are often at their worst defensively.
But quietly, the inability to force turnovers, and offer some counterweight to those issues, has been equally problematic. Crean-coached teams have rarely been prolific at creating takeaways, but this winter has proved especially barren.
If the season ended today, Indiana's opponent turnover rate (16.4 percent) would be the second-lowest number in Crean's nine-year tenure behind only 2014-15, statistically the Hoosiers' worst defensive team in the past 10 years.

Hence the added emphasis this weekend.
‚ÄúWe're at our best when we're able to get stops and run out,‚Äù junior guard James Blackmon Jr. said, ‚Äúbecause we have so many athletes on this team. That's our main focus, and I feel like we did that (against Rutgers).‚Äù
They did, and it paid off. Indiana's 21 turnovers forced led directly to 33 points, a season high. IU outscored the Scarlet Knights 21-2 in fast-break points, and Rutgers finished with just five assists. Sophomore forward OG Anunoby finished with seven steals, a number that tied the fourth-best single-game performance in program history.
Crean's pregame message wasn't just heard on the radio.
‚ÄúYea, we all did,‚Äù Anunoby said, when asked if the Hoosiers took that challenge personally. ‚ÄúWe all tried to jump the gaps and be aggressive with our hands.‚Äù
The complicated part will be repeating the process.
Indiana has shown signs of improved ball security. Not since committing 19 turnovers against Nebraska have the Hoosiers posted as many in one game as their season average of 15.1.
Still, it's unlikely the turnover issue will ever be entirely resolved this season. It would be better addressed with steady improvement in both directions, committing just a few less, and forcing just a few more. Because Blackmon is right ‚Äî as poor as IU might be defending in transition, the Hoosiers are outstanding when they themselves get out in the open floor, thanks to those athletes and good spot-up 3-point shooters.
‚ÄúIt's a priority not to gamble, because we're not quick enough to get up and just overplay and then snap your head and grab the backdoor pass,‚Äù Crean said Sunday. ‚ÄúBut that's an awareness thing. When your awareness is high, and when your urgency level is high, then you're much better.‚Äù

INDIANA at PENN STATE
Tipoff: 7 p.m. Wednesday, Bryce Jordan Center, State College, Pa.
TV: Big Ten Network.
Radio: WIBC-FM (93.1).
STORYLINES
‚Ä¢ After suffering three defeats to Penn State (11-7, 3-2 Big Ten) between the Nittany Lions' entrance into the conference (1990) and 2007, IU has lost eight times in the series since, including two of the past three. A road win Wednesday would be a boost for an Indiana (12-6, 2-3) team trying to get its season back on track after a frustrating turn of the year.
‚Ä¢ Penn State's rotation includes a pair of talented freshmen that were one-time IU recruits as well. Between them, Lamar Stevens and Tony Carr are averaging 23.2 points, 11 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game.
‚Ä¢ After a rocky nonconference season, Penn State has recovered well in Big Ten play. The Nittany Lions opened with a home loss to Northwestern but have since won three of four, including a victory over Michigan State in Philadelphia and a home win over Minnesota.

The Times Poll : 42% Would Limit Civil Rights in AIDS Battle
The national survey of 2,095 people, conducted July 24 to 28, was designed to assess public perceptions of how to control the AIDS epidemic and to see if these had changed since the 1985 poll.
Also, 68% said they would favor criminal sanctions against people with AIDS who remain sexually active, and 84% approved making it a crime for people in AIDS high-risk groups to donate blood. Both findings represent significant increases since the same questions were asked by The Times Poll in December, 1985, when the affirmative figures were 51% and 77%, respectively.
When asked "do you think some civil liberties must be suspended in the war on AIDS," 42% of respondents in the nationwide poll said yes, 38% said no, and 19% were not sure.
Many Americans are prepared to accept very strong measures to battle the mounting AIDS epidemic, and 42% believe that some civil liberties must be suspended in the effort, according to the Los Angeles Times Poll.
The new survey showed that about half of Americans would tolerate mandatory testing for people with a high risk of acquiring AIDS and adding AIDS to the list of infectious diseases that require quarantine.
In addition, the percentage of respondents who favor a tattoo for people who test positive for the AIDS virus, a proposal once ad vanced by conservative columnist William F. Buckley Jr., has nearly doubled--from 15% to 29%--since the last poll.
Nearly three-quarters of respondents agreed that AIDS is mainly a question of community health, not civil rights.
"There has been a hardening of public attitudes on AIDS," said I. A. Lewis, the director of The Times Poll. "It is almost as if many Americans think of civil liberties as a luxury when it comes to protecting the public health."
Such steps as widespread mandatory AIDS testing, quarantine and tattoos for AIDS virus carriers would go far beyond the voluntary measures favored by leading public health officials throughout the world as the best means to control the inevitably fatal disease.
These officials, such as U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and Dr. Jonathan Mann of the World Health Organization, have stressed that individuals must take a major responsibility for protecting themselves against the sexually transmitted and blood-borne AIDS virus. They have also argued that AIDS virus carriers and AIDS patients should not be excluded from society or discriminated against.
However, most Americans agreed with the majority of AIDS experts that widespread, mandatory testing of people for the AIDS virus is a less effective measure against the disease than increased public education and research.
Steps to Fight Epidemic
When asked to choose among education, testing and research as the single most worthwhile step "that should be taken at the present time to fight the AIDS epidemic," 46% of the respondents favored more education, 42% more research, and only 6% more testing.
When asked to choose the "least productive" step, 54% said more testing, 24% more education and 12% more research.
Respondents were sharply divided over whether such testing should be mandatory; 49% supported mandatory testing and 47% voluntary testing.
While they may not classify widespread testing as a particularly effective deterrent to AIDS, however, Americans are nonetheless tolerant to the notion of more testing.
When asked "which if any of the following groups of people do you think it would be most useful to test for the presence of the the AIDS virus?" 29% of those interviewed said "all citizens," 16% "drug abusers," 16% "known homosexuals," and 14% prostitutes.
Such testing does not detect the AIDS virus particles themselves. Rather, the blood tests identify proteins called AIDS antibodies, which are produced by the body's immune system in response to infection with the virus. While those who test positive are considered infected with the virus and capable of transmitting it to others, they may or may not actually develop AIDS.
By now almost everyone seems aware and concerned about the immigration ban called for by President Trump which forbids entrance into the U.S. to all refugees and anyone from the seven Muslim-majority countries. On Saturday night, New York City cab drivers went on strike, to join the resistance by halting service at JFK airport for an hour, in protest of shutting out over 218 million people from entering the United States, according to CNN. The NY Taxi Workers Alliance's Facebook post includes not only the announcement of their service protest but also a message of opposition to the president's ban. The organization wrote:
Stand in Solidarity With Thousands Protesting Inhumane, Unconstitutional Ban of Muslim Refugees and travelers. Be united brothers & sisters for a just world. We cannot be silent. We go to work to welcome people to a land that once welcomed us. We are the wretched, the tired, the hungry, the poor. We will not be divided.
Calling ALL DRIVERS! YELLOW, UBER, EVERYONE: Do not pick up at JFK Airport tonight, Saturday January 28th, from 6m to... Posted by NY Taxi Workers Alliance on Saturday, January 28, 2017
Cab drivers followed through with this strike and made a stand by, well, leaving their cab stands. The union shared a picture of the empty sidewalk that would be a sea of yellow had the cabbies not protested.
No cabs in this line at JFK terminal 4. #NoBanNoWall #RefugeesWelcome pic.twitter.com/ZX5BycRTie ‚Äî NY Taxi Workers (@NYTWA) January 28, 2017
The NYTWA (a non-profit union) included Uber in their Facebook address, urging all driving services in New York City to stand in solidarity with protestors and those banned from entering the U.S. However, Uber took to Twitter to announce their canceling of surge prices on rides to and from JFK right after the official strike hour.
Surge pricing has been turned off at #JFK Airport. This may result in longer wait times. Please be patient. ‚Äî Uber NYC (@Uber_NYC) January 29, 2017
While Uber's statement suggested that they were aware of the huge protests at JFK and were trying to assist protestors by allowing prices to go un-increased due to surges of requests, they still broke NYTWA's call for strike and likely even profited from the taxi drivers' withholding of service. This sparked a movement of people deleting the Uber app, as the company broke the workers alliance's call for strike and capitalized on anti-ban protests.
NYC Taxi drivers went on strike from JFK last night to protest Trump's order. Uber picked up slack. Lyft is donating $1million to the ACLU ‚Äî Eric Alterman (@Eric_Alterman) January 29, 2017
Uber's founder, Travis Kalanick, shared an email that they claim they sent to Uber drivers about the Muslim ban on their Facebook page, revealing that they plan to meet with Trump on Friday for a business advisory group meeting, as they are a member of the president's economic advisory group. Kalanick's relationship with Trump has sparked objections in the past, as they recently told employees, ‚ÄúWe'll partner with anyone in the world as long they're about making transportation in cities better, creating job opportunities, making it easier to get around, getting pollution out of the air and traffic off the streets‚Äù according to CNN.
Hence the movement #DeleteUber which trended on Saturday night on Twitter, with people sharing screenshots of their deleting of the popular car service app.
Last night I logged in to #deleteuber. Felt reluctance for a split second. then remembered the Montgomery Bus Boycott & felt ashamed. pic.twitter.com/D9WEtmkz6W ‚Äî wikipedia brown (@eveewing) January 29, 2017
Some were, um, more vehement than others as users by accusing Uber of acting as ‚Äúscabs‚Äù ‚Äî a term for people who cross picket lines and diminish the effectiveness of a worker's strike.
i never used it in NYC for a lot of reasons but they won't see a goddamned penny from me ever again #deleteuber pic.twitter.com/Wh1Yhe5aZa ‚Äî matt ‚óâ lubchansky (@Lubchansky) January 29, 2017
Many people announced their new devotion for Uber's competitor, Lyft, which pledged to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) over the weekend.
This is an Amazon training exercise. Because i come from political movements that failed at explaining the present or radaring the storms moving in from the future. (Let's leave aside the point that previous movements of rebellion often claimed ‚Äúvictories‚Äù that were really defeats). We didn't understand things as basic as winning & losing. Instead of seeing victory & defeat as parts of a contradiction, interdependent and interwoven, we were taught to believe that victories were only a straight line of stepping stones to even more victories. While defeats were something separate blamed on factors outside us, on conditions beyond our control or even on the enemy. That's no longer acceptable because it gets us nowhere. The limitation is not men's repression but within ourselves.
Patriarchal histories left Harriet at the end of the Civil War, triumphant, their war finished. Ready to head back to their home in New York and a much-earned retirement. Like the happy ending of the Hollywood romantic comedy, this only works because of the audience's ‚Äúwillful suspension of disbelief.‚Äù Forgotten is their original ‚Äúhome‚Äù on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where they often vowed to return a free woman. If Harriet had returned South then instead of heading North into permanent exile, they surely would have been murdered as so many New Afrikan activists were after the Civil war (as even their former husband was).
Even more to the point, we don't live in a world where Harriets won. i mean, if Harriet won why was i sitting in the Mississippi State Penitentiary in 1961 with women who couldn't even vote and who lived under daily terrorism? That victory & defeat in 1865 changed everything. Changed the Black struggle, changed the U.S. empire, changed Harriet. And this principle isn't just about New Afrika. How come if women's liberation won in the 1970s‚Äìas we're told every single day‚Äìwe watch with disinterest as 30 million women are dying of AIDS in a coldly deliberate mass murder in Afrika? A program of cutting-edge mass murder that even dwarfs the old Afrikan Slave trade and the Nazi death camps. Nor is any victory of women's liberation compatible with European rape camps and the exploding global sex slavery of millions of women. The known outcomes and how we've been ordered to think about reality aren't compatible. We have to relearn how to think, not as a philosophical luxury but as a necessity of life or death.
We have to look at the military situation, then, the political-military situation if you will, at the end of the Civil War. On one day it all changed. Winning & losing had changed everything. The U.S. empire with its new industries and military, were suddenly freed from internal strife to gaze outward, to turn their attention towards colonial expansion in all directions. Especially towards finishing off their remaining problems with the Indian nations and peoples. For so long estranged into two competing brother social systems‚Äìslave capitalism versus semi-slave capitalism‚Äìeuro-amerikans were once again united in one settler empire. Northern Wall Street was king, but symbiotically needed its recent enemy, the Southern bourgeoisie, as its local manager over the New Afrikan labor that produced the cotton, tobacco and other valuable cash exports. Victorious white Abolitionism withered into dust as the Southern white terrorism of the defeated Confederates rose up and up. The New Afrikan freedom struggle had ended chattel slavery by its military alliance with the Federal government and the Union Army. But the next day this same alliance became the new chains that reenslaved. While the Black Nation of ex-slaves found itself with a class and gender hierarchy it had never experienced before. And Harriet, they won & lost on the same day. Because winning & losing changes everything.
Let me repeat it, to double the stitch: this is an Amazon training exercise. If i can't learn to analyze victory & defeat in herstory, where all the forces & factors, hopes & outcomes are known, how can I decipher the chaotic present?
The present, we are told, is all we need to focus on. Really, the present is so razor-thin a slice of reality that we teeter on it unable to keep our balance. Only by triangulating it with past & future do we know our ground. We don't study the present to learn the future. It's the reverse: we reveal the hidden past and look out at the future to really understand our present.
That moment where Harriet won & lost on the same day is an example not simply of change but of the inner way that change happens. It was a nodal point, a point of complication where accumulating quantities of change suddenly crystalize into a change of basic quality. A sudden knotting and unknotting of change. For instance, the point where the ebbing of life in a body becomes death is one such nodal point. This is a basic process in all reality. Harriet always remembered that moment on their Northward escape when they knew that they had reached Pennsylvania, and was no longer a slave. ‚ÄúWhen I found that I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person. There was such a glory over everything. The sun came like gold through the trees, and over the fields, and I felt like I was in Heaven.‚Äù
The step-by-step freeing of what had been a slave society resulted not simply in individuals who were legally free, but in a transformed Black society. Which in its turn reshaped how New Afrikans faced the unexpected challenges of the post slavery period called Black Reconstruction. Nor was that just their story alone, in isolation, or just white settlers' story. Both were part of a wave of world change, a new stage in the development of capitalism as a civilization.
This is something we're not used to, which is why it's so hard. Searching beneath the surface of stories we never told, stories handed to us as subliminal orders, to find not only a deeper level but many overlaid levels of reality at once. To start with, there is the reality of winning & losing.
Don't dismiss this as so obvious. Women have a real trouble sorting this out. Winning & losing doesn't mean merely that the winners get their way for awhile. Both victory & defeat change the players themselves. Change the very ground we stand on. This is more real than we've dealt with. Look at what happens to us, to women, whenever we are defeated. Even our bodies are changed. It isn't just old Chinese footbinding or the constricted, literally imprisoning clothing that white women were ordered to wear. Or the genital mutilation of millions upon millions of girl-children. It's also the deliberate downsizing of muscle + bone, the breeding out of women's physical strength and abilities. So that capitalism's socially idealized woman is weaker, smaller compared to men, less able, dis armed, dependent on men in men's world. Listen to how many euro-people say that Venus and Serena aren't physically like ‚Äúreal‚Äù women should be, because they're too powerful.
Because the war with patriarchy isn't simply between women and men, in some linear way. Women's bodies are the land that the war has always been on (which is why the Barbara Kreuger pro-choice poster, ‚ÄúYour Body Is A Battleground‚Äù). We ourselves, whether we win or lose, whether we recognize it or not, are a military terrain. Which is why Amazon thinking is women's military thinking in a whole deeper logic.
It's not so much that we are ignorant, it's that women are still disoriented. In my EMT course we were told that to be disoriented is to be confused as to location, time, and identity (the reason ER doctors ask patients regaining consciousness if they know who they are, where they are and what day it is). This is us. Regaining consciousness but still disoriented as to location, time, and identity. We need to relearn how to think.
There are two main kinds of thinking in the Western world. The first, in rough shorthand, we can call Aristotelian thinking, after the Greek philosopher. This kind of thinking sees things as having a fixed identity, belonging to rigid categories that are unchanging, bending if at all only under the pressure of outside forces. The second is dialectics, which sees everything as the flow of constant inner change of contradictions.
Quick picture: dialectics is based on seeing that everything calls into existence its own opposite. Not as something external to it, but as something internal, an evolving unity of the original and its opposite. The old Southern system of slavery, for example, called into existence its polar opposite the Black Nation, and was of necessity composed of itself and this New Afrikan colony. One didn't have an existence without the other. Dialectics reveals how nothing is static or monolithic, but everything moves forward from the playing out of these internal contradictions. Change comes from within as the struggle of opposites, but these opposites always interpenetrate and recreate each other in new forms.
This is a global recognition of the non-linear, underlying wave pattern of reality, although in the West it is usually ascribed to the German 19th century philosopher Hegel and their more revolutionary disciple, Karl Marx. Hegel, however, was themselves shaped by Taoism from China. Whether Taoism and Zen Buddhism in China and Japan or Jainism in India or radical philosophy in Europe from the time of the Greek philosopher Democritus onward, we can find in one rough shape or another this same recognition of dialectics. It is easier to crudely outline the yin & yang of it than it is to really learn it, but we can't make war successfully without tuning ourselves to it.
Modern bourgeois classes may praise Aristotelian thinking, but their system itself tries not to use it. They couldn't stay on top if they did. In Aristotle's original theories, nature was composed of many species but no evolution. Society, too. Their own Greek slaveowner class was considered eternally better, just as men had to forever rule women. That type of thinking has been used as ruling class ideology & propaganda for centuries but it isn't functional in a modern world.
Even high capitalist military theory had to be hastily ripped apart after radical peasant guerrilla armies began defeating their suburban military in the 1950s and 1960s. Amerikkka's one-sided advantage in ‚ÄúB-52 science‚Äù wasn't enough to win, even as the established global superpower with a two million man professional military using everything from helicopter-born army divisions to chemical weapons. Now, newer imperialist counter-insurgency theory uses dialectical thinking, and is based on finding internal contradictions to change the very nature of oppressed societies. Not simply brute outside force. Like empowering men in self-destructive gender-classes on a mass scale, freely arming them into rightist warlord gangs whether in Central America or South L.A.
In the Internet, in art, in physics, in the biosciences, in field after field those responsible for making things work have pragmatically moved away from old modes of thinking. So modern international classes may deny dialectical thinking‚Äì but they use it economically, militarily, scientifically. While they school us in this useless linear thinking from before the Middle Ages that isn't functional, that doesn't allow us to grasp the terrible opportunities of change.
In the 1960s the Palestinian liberation movement adopted the slogan ‚ÄúFrom One Generation To the Next‚ÄìUntil Liberation.‚Äù It had a seeming power to it, not only of expressing mass determination but of inexorable struggle making progress inch by inch, year by year. Only problem, it ‚Äòs not true. Because winning & losing changes everything, including all the players and all the sides. You don't have generation after generation, you only think you do.
Especially here in amerikkka, women believe in constant ‚Äúprogress‚Äù for us. That no matter how disappointed we are today, that next year or next generation life will inexorably be freer for us no matter how little we do about it. Only because we have been systematically wiped clean of knowing that we don't notice the little rips and tears in this silly lie. That Iroquois women had more legal power over government in their society in the 19th century than college educated professional women today can even imagine having. That East German women had rights in 1970 that they don't have today. That abortion rights in the U.S. keep disappearing in hospital after hospital, county after country, area after area as the tide of men's neo-fascist politics spreads.
Winning & losing changes everything. We need to remember this against the amnesia and drift of daily life in the world of men.

Bubblegum Alley
Bubblegum Alley is a tourist attraction in downtown San Luis Obispo, California, known for its accumulation of used bubble gum on the walls of an alley.[1] It is a 15-foot (4.6 m) high and 70-foot (21 m) long alley lined with chewed gum left by passers-by. It covers a stretch of 20 meters in the 700 block of Higuera Street in downtown San Luis Obispo.[1][2]
History [ edit ]
According to the San Luis Obispo Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Business Improvement Association (BIA), the origin of the gum is "a little sketchy".[3] Some historians believe that the tradition of the alley started after WWII as a San Luis Obispo High School graduating class event.[4] Others believe it started in the late 1950s, as the rivalry between San Luis Obispo High School and California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) students.[3] By the 1970s, Bubblegum Alley was well established. When shop owners complained that it was "unsanitary and disgusting",[5] the alley underwent a full cleaning. The gum graffiti survived two full cleanings in the 1970s.[3] In 1996, the BIA unsuccessfully attempted to have another alley cleaning.
Recognition [ edit ]
Throughout the years, San Luis Obispo's Bubblegum Alley has been featured on a number of television shows, news programs, and in newspapers around the world. Newspapers such as The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times have addressed the disgusts and delights of the gum wall visitors. Other newspaper articles have appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle, the Grand Rapids Press in Michigan, the Times Union from Albany, New York, and The Guardian in the United Kingdom. KSBY Action 6 News did a story about the alleyway.[4] TV crews filmed the alley for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, That's Incredible!, Real People, and on "California's Gold" PBS.[5] MTV featured Bubblegum Alley in the show Call to Greatness.[6] The crew picked Bubblegum Alley to film the episode on breaking the world record for largest bubblegum bubble. It featured record holder Susan "Chewsy Suzy" Williams, and at the end of the show, a graphic was shown that said that while they were there they blew a 24-inch (610 mm) bubble, which was not shown on television. (Her record bubble, which was blown on national TV in 1996, was 23 inches.) ABC's (American Broadcasting Company) Ripley's Believe It or Not also aired a story on October 14, 1984 about the alley. It was also featured on an episode of The Girls Next Door on E! and mentioned in an episode of the United States of Tara.
Books [ edit ]
In chapter seventeen of the novel Mr. Monk On the Road by Lee Goldberg, Bubblegum Alley is mentioned, described, and forms the setting for Monk's discovery of a dead body. Bubblegum Alley is also mentioned throughout Megan McDonald's book Judy Moody: Around the World in 8 and a Half Days.
Music [ edit ]
"Weird Al" Yankovic mentioned Bubblegum Alley in their 1978 song "Take Me Down," an ode to San Luis Obispo.
Those Darn Accordions recorded the song "Wall of Gum" on their 1999 album Clownhead about an unfortunate accident occurring in Bubblegum Alley.
Controversy [ edit ]
Agreement whether these gum-covered walls should remain a part of quaint downtown San Luis Obispo has not been reached since its founding. While the town historian and some local politicians consider this alley to be an ‚Äúeyesore‚Äù,[7] the Chamber of Commerce lists it as a ‚Äúspecial attraction‚Äù.[8]
The Telegram Tribune reported that Bill Hales, a local pub owner, pays for the alley to be steam-cleaned once a month.[9]
Store owners' complaints concerning upkeep are countered by the argument that it increases foot traffic and business. Debrorah Holley, administrator of the Downtown Business Improvement Association, admits that despite the obvious problems it causes, it is nonetheless a landmark.[9] The alley attracts tourists to the downtown, in such large numbers that there used to be a local radio station disc jockey that led people on bimonthly tours of the gum alley gallery.[7]
As art [ edit ]
Professional artists [ edit ]
The Alley has inspired professional artists such as Matthew Hoffman. On the east end of the alley, up high on the north-facing wall, a giant self-portrait of Hoffman titled "Projectbubble Gum" is created entirely with bubble gum. The picture of the artist blowing a bubble required a tremendous amount of gum, which they were able to get with the help of the community. Their theory is, "if an individual participates in their community they will earn an invested interest in their community. The community chewed the bubblegum, and many individuals [felt] as though they were a part of its creation. This instills a sense of flight attendantship in one's community". Even the robotics Team 1717, featured in the book The New Cool, is depicted in neon blue gum.[10]
Poets [ edit ]
One Arroyo Grande poet who wishes to be known as ‚ÄúM‚Äù wrote in defense of the Gum Alley. Their poem was published in Don Pieper's article in the Telegram-Tribune, 30, Apr 1986, "An Ode to Gum Alley".

Britain raised the terror threat level from substantial to severe Friday, meaning that a terrorist attack is considered highly likely.
Home Secretary Theresa Mays said the decision to raise the threat level was related to developments in Iraq and Syria, but that there was no information to suggest an attack was imminent. Some of the plots are likely to involve fighters who have traveled from Britain and Europe to take part in fighting in the Middle East.
"We face a real and serious threat in the UK from international terrorism," they said. "I would urge the public to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the police."
May says the decision by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Center is made on the basis of intelligence and is independent of government. "Severe" is the second-highest of five levels.

Dramatic CCTV footage has captured the moment a mother and their two children were forced to run for their lives after a manhole cover exploded in a Northampton street.
A camera outside Abington Supermarket in Wellingborough Road filmed the moment an electrical fault caused the explosion in the pavement next to a cashpoint being used by the family.
The moment the manhole cover exploded
The force of the blast ripped part of the newsagent's shop sign down, which narrowly avoided colliding with the head of the young boy.
Emergency services were called out to the incident, near to the junction with Bostock Avenue, shortly after 8am on Tuesday and the mother was treated by the ambulance service. An East Midlands Ambulance Service spokesperson said: ‚ÄúAn ambulance attended to treat a woman who had been walking in the area with two children when the cover flew into the air, but there were no serious injuries.‚Äù
A spokesperson for Northamptonshire Fire Service said the cause of the explosion was an electrical fault in an underground box.
A large trench was built outside Abington Supermarket to allow workers from Western Power to fix the junction box. Western Power said that power would be cut to at least 90 properties in Northampton on Tuesday as the company carried out repairs.

A total of 90 properties were temporarily without power on Tuesday, with all electricity supplies switched back on by 4pm.
A spokesperson for Western Power said: ‚ÄúWe have conducted it in stages so as to minimise disruption as much as possible, but we apologise to residents for any inconvenience caused.‚Äù
The sound of the explosion was heard by residents in the town centre and Abington area. Wellingborough Road was temporarily closed after the incident but was fully reopened shortly afterwards.
Following the explosion, a total of 70 properties in Wellingborough Road and East Street were left without power and an additional 20 properties had power temporarily switched off.

Amanda Sekayena, who runs Ama Seka - which is next door to Abington Supermarket in Wellingborough Road where the manhole exploded - said they were glad that nobody was hurt in the incident but wanted the pavement to be fixed as soon as possible.
They said: ‚ÄúIt is really affecting my trade as it makes it look like my shop is closed. My shop was not open at the time and I am glad nobody was hurt.
‚ÄúIt could have been a lot worse as there is no damage to my shop and it only brought down a part of the supermarket sign.‚Äù
Ms Sekayena, who had no power to their shop on Tuesday morning, said they had been told by Western Power that the repair work was due to be completed in the next couple of days.
The 10 players of EU LCS that I am excited to watch and why (COMPLETE)
This will be the first 5 players I am keeping my eye on this upcoming split and why. Some of these opinions may differ to yours and thats fine, because these are simply opinions of mine. My writing is not perfect either, It's mainly just to give you guys an idea of why I'm interested to see how these players shape out to be in the split.
This is in no particular order at all.
ALLIANCE ‚Äì Shook
A lot of the hype around ALLIANCE will undoubtedly be around their newest acquisition, Rekkles, however I've decided to go a different route. I have no doubt in my mind that Rekkles is a top ADC in EU, and the west as well, but my eyes have a different focus. Shook has been regarded as a top contender for the best jungler in EU, however, a lot of people, myself included, have criticized their consistency in the LCS games and on the international stage. One can remember their flawless Lee Sin game against NJWS at the world championship and then compare it to their less than stellar performances in the EU regional playoffs or their most recent IEM San Jose performance. The acquisition of shook was a well sighted one, with a lot of people praising their ability from the jungle, and there is no doubt to their potential skill ceiling if they can fix their consistency issues within the EU LCS split. Shook is my player to watch because I am interested to see if they can start to show development and improvement upon fixing their vision control and consistency that will put them clearly above the other top Junglers of their region such as Svenskeren and Jankos. I look forward to seeing what ALLIANCE can do especially with a new support staff behind them.  They are my player to watch because if they can fix their consistency issues, they can become the best jungler in Europe, but if they can't , there is potential for a new face to appear in that role come Summer.
ROCCAT -- Nukeduck
The newest player to join ROCCAT, some might say one of the most obvious roster changes, will be the former world championship player Nukeduck. Nukeduck impressed a lot of people in their premiere split back in the Summer of 2013 as a top tier mid laner competing amongst the ranks of Froggen, Alex Ich and Peke. Their fall from grace was however very sudden, when they got relegated by KMT (now known as ROCCAT ironically) and subsequently banned.  They are however back, and the meta favors their assassin heavy style very well, their known champions being Ahri and Zed. On the new ROCCAT, I expect nukeduck to impress a lot of people once again and solidify themselves as a top tier mid of the region once again.  They are my player to watch simply because I believe them to be one of the most dominant mid laners in this upcoming spring split. On a team with outstanding players like Vander and Jankos, a player of Nukeducks caliber is sure to shine.
SK GAMING ‚Äì Forgiven
Forgiven is another player who only really had one split to showcase their skill. Picked up to the challenger team Copenhagen Wolves, following their departure of their star player Rekkles (being loaned to them from FNATIC) Forgiven had some big shoes to fill; and boy did they fill them. They not only impressed a lot of people in their rise to power during the challenger scene, they were widely regarded as one of CW's best players during the LCS split. However disputes within the team caused them to unfortunately not be on the roster for the summer split and they enjoyed a brief period of inactivity as a pro. They have returned to the new SK gaming lineup with a point to prove; that they are one of the best that EU has to offer. They were very vocal about their drive to win and how they felt that their team held them back, resulting in a fine earlier in 2014. Now they are on a team with fairly strong players such as top laner Fredy112, nRated, the newly acquired Fox and Svenskeren. They will have their chance to show that they have the drive to win and only to win, and to solidify themselves as a definite top ADC of EUW on this roster.  They are my player to watch because I'm excited to see Forgiven return to the LCS.  They are a passionate player who has definitely not only matured from their experiences but one can say also gotten much smarter and hungrier.
Bonus player to keep an eye on: Fox
Strong in the challenger scene, Fox will have much to prove in this coming LCS split.
FNATIC ‚Äì Febiven
The so-called tilt master had an impeccable performance in the expansion tournament, albeit it being on another team, they boasted an undefeated record in all 6 games with an incredibly high KDA. EU mid laners indeed. The young blood player has joined alongside veteran Yellowstar on the new FNATIC lineup to the disappointment of many. Many, myself included, were looking forward to the complete H2K lineup competing in the EU LCS. However regardless of the team they are on, Febiven is clearly in the LCS to prove a point. With multiple accounts in the top 25 of EUW challenger ladder, the young player clearly has the mechanical prowess to compete with the best. They have a lot to prove in the competitive stage, but with all the hype around the new EU mids, they will have a strong competing ground. Regardless, everyone including myself are anxious to see Febiven in action, even if they are on a new team. I look forward specifically for the Febiven vs. Nukeduck matchup, as both are close in sharing strategies amongst each other and have quite similar playstyles.  They are strong new talent, and their performance on this team could make or sink their career.
GAMBIT ‚Äì Diamondprox
The legend himself. Diamondprox has been known by many names; god of the jungle, master innovator, best jungler in the world, since the start of their career on the incredibly dominant Moscow 5 earlier in Season 2. Diamondprox, like GAMBIT, had a fall from grace early in Season 4, with 5th place finish in the spring split and a 7th in the Summer, which led a lot of people to believe that the time of the jungle god is over, However, a revitalized Diamondprox and GAMBIT Gaming appeared in the most recent IEM Cologne tournament. Much like the story of GAMBIT's career, they took a convincing 1st place victory over CLG, with Diamondprox looking very much on point. A lot of the attention was pointed at p1noy, who had an excellent showing, and as much as I'd like to put them as the player to watch, I feel that the return of a revitalized Diamondprox and what that could mean for the jungle meta this upcoming spring split‚Ä¶. That is just exciting. They were known as a top innovator back in S2, who's to say they can't do that again? I look forward to seeing Diamondprox brave the new jungle and what tricks they have to pull out.
Bonus player to keep an eye on: p1noy
Can't say GAMBIT without p1noy nowadays, they had a fantastic showing in IEM Cologne and everyone looks forward to seeing how they can do in the upcoming split.
UOL ‚Äì Vardags
UOL has many known members on their team, Vizi in the top lane with their unconventional Poppy, Hylissang and their heat seeking thresh hooks, Kikis with their ability to pull out random junglers, and PowerOfEvil with the impressive showcase of their Syndra. You might be wondering why of all these players I decided to pick their AD carry, Vardags. Well you see it's just that, of all the players on their team, one might say that Vardags is the most‚Ä¶ conventional. They lack a certain identity that makes them pop out like the others on UOL. Their conventional play as an AD Carry as well has been, in my eyes, slightly underwhelming. They have a really good attitude towards improvement, and a very unique team behind him, so for them to define their own playstyle on a team open to trying many different strategies should be easy. I want to see how Vardags improves themselves over the split, if they can make an identity for themselves like the others on their team, or at the very least to rise through the ranks in the AD carry role.
Bonus player to watch: UOL
This entire team is crazy as fuck.
GIANTS ‚Äì Rydle
GIANTS was the last team to qualify into the LCS through the Expansion tournament, taking a 3-0 victory over RG in the loser bracket to secure their spot. Throughout the series, even against H2k, one player had really stood out to me. It was not xPepii, who unfortunately actually had a very underwhelming series against H2k. Rydle, throughout the entire expansion tournament, showed that they are the real deal on this team. When given their Thresh, they land some insane hooks and is very accurate with their lantern placements. When given their Alistar, they have no fear making some incredibly strong engages under your turret, tanking everything up for their team. A lot of people will say that the GIANTS mid laner is the main person to watch, and I would agree with you if we didn't have such stacked mid lane talent in the EU LCS. Rydle has a good chance to make a name for themselves as a solid support in the LCS, and it will be interesting to see how they fare against the likes of the other top supports like Yellowstar and nRated. Rydle is one of the big playmakers of their team, so look to them to see how GIANTS fares.
MYM ‚Äì Nisbeth
MYM, formerly known as SHC, have had a bit of a troubling past when it came to supports. They joined the LCS with Migxa, the incredibly aggressive, ‚Äò'nice'' shouting Leona main who ended up racking the most deaths in that split. Then, in the summer, they picked up Wewillfailer, who was swiftly swapped over for Kasing about 5 weeks in. Now they have opted to swap Kasing out for the new and untested Nisbeth. Nisbeth has been skirting around the challenger ladder for quite some time now, but this will be first LCS debut. A lot of questions were raised when the sudden drop of Impaler and Kasing was announced. Some claimed it was disputes within the team, nevertheless, they have a new face in the bot lane. MrRallez was considered a good ADC in their own demand, but will them and Nisbeth really shine? Will they impress like the Rallez+Migxa or Rallez+Kasing duo we used to see? SHC ended up 3rd in their summer split during the actual split, but fell to a disappointing 5th. I'm curious to see this new face in the LCS, and want to see how Nisbeth and Rallez synergize in the bot lane.
CW ‚Äì Freeze
The curse of Freeze has ended. Finally Freeze will have a chance to show themselves on the LCS stage. The last time we saw Freeze in the LCS, they were alongside Bjergsen in the NiP squad. What people don't remember is that Freeze actually used to play with the old CW back when they were known as Samurais in Jeans with Unlimited in the bot lane and Youngbuck in the top, so this wouldn't be the first time they joined forces. That being said, there is a lot of hype surrounding Freeze, a lot of people were saying that they were the only member on the old NiP squad who truly looked ‚Äò'alive'' per say. The only one who looked to really try to make plays and perform well. A lot of people were looking forwards to their return to the LCS to see how they fare once again, and now they will have their chance. I'm curious to see how Freeze and Unlimited synergize as compared to Woolite did in the first split. This will be their chance to shine on their team, and prove that they were LCS caliber from the start.
H2K ‚Äì Odoamne
Last but definitely not least it's the much anticipated debut of H2K. A team that I was assisting into the LCS, however, they'll be using a new face in the mid lane considering the departure of Febiven. That being said, we're here to talk about Odoamne, my player to watch. Odoamne has, for the longest time, been an incredibly solid and versatile member of the top lane. Their innovation regarding the rise of Trundle in the top lane, their ability to adapt and even go toe-to-toe with Zorozero, widely regarded as one of the best, during their CS matches puts them at the top of the list for me. I truly believe that Odoamne is one of the best top laners in EUW and will continue to prove that by their performance in the LCS. Their ability to adapt from a utility role to a tank role to a hard carry role during the expansion tournament really showcased just how versatile and skilled they were at all aspects of the role. Their laning and teleport knowledge are on point, and they will impress a lot of people.  They are probably not only my player to watch for H2K but also could be my player to watch for the entirety of LCS. EU is criticized for its lack of effective top laners. I'm confident that Odoamne will stamp their authority
Bonus player to watch: Voidle
They were formerly on gambit in summer of 2013 and even went to worlds. They had a solid showing at the Expansion tournament and a lot of people will look to see how they fare amongst new faces in the LCS.

‚ÄúI can touch my eye with my tongue.‚Äù (Video: Barcroft TV)
Can you imagine potentially having the world's longest tongue? And then uploading a video of it on YouTube. Now can you imagine the kinds of comments you'd receive?
Since their high school days, Adrianne Lewis, now 18 and a college first-year student, created a series of videos showing off their 4-inch tongue. But they aren't the first in the family to have exceptional length in tongue. Them mother's side of the family all had extremely long tongues as well.
View photos
‚ÄúI feel as though I may have inherited it. But I think with time and me being the weird kid I was and always sticking out my tongue it could have ‚Ä¶stretched.‚Äù Lewis said in a Barcroft TV interview.
Lewis (or as they call themselves on social media, ‚ÄúLong Tongue Lewis‚Äù) can touch their elbow, their nose, their eye (with help of their hand), and even roll it.
View photos
Lewis believes that their tongue is long enough to break the Guinness World Record, although they have not been officially judged ‚Äî the title currently belongs to Nick Stoeberi, whose tongue measures in at 3.97 in.
Related: The 2-Second Tongue Test You Should Do Right Now
The stretched out muscle that has been gaining attention all over the internet is actually eight muscles, according to Scientific American. ‚ÄúThe soft patty of flesh we call the tongue is not just one muscle, it's a conglomeration of eight separate muscles. Unlike other muscles, such as the bicep, tongue muscles don't develop around a supporting bone. ‚Äú
According to a University of Delaware study, only about 65-80 percent of the population can roll their tongues, and the debate about it being genetic is ongoing.
A tongue this long, though, has its challenges. ‚ÄúI bite my tongue every single day,‚Äù says Lewis in one of their videos ‚Äî and often in the same place, over and over again. Ouch.

The Navy's Other Seals ... And Dolphins
Enlarge this image toggle caption Bob Houlihan/AP/U.S. Navy Bob Houlihan/AP/U.S. Navy
We've all heard of the missile gap during the Cold War. This week we learned of another gap between Russia and the United States ‚Äî a sea lion gap.
Gennady Matishov, the director of the Murmansk Marine Biology Institute in northern Russia, told the Russian newspaper Izvestia that Russia needs to catch up to the United States when it comes to militarized sea mammals.
Seriously?
"It is true that the U.S. military does employ teams of dolphins and sea lions," Noah Shachtman says. He's an editor for Wired Magazine and runs its military technology blog, "Danger Room."
They take on two roles, Shachtman says. "One is to look for underwater mines, and the other is that marine mammals are used to patrol certain U.S. bases to watch out for the very unlikely event of a terrorist swimmer attack."
The animals are trained at the Navy's Marine Mammal Program in San Diego. In one task, dolphins might learn how to use strobe lights to mark intruders.
"A dolphin would drop the strobe light, and that would signal the humans to come and respond to the infiltration," Shachtman says.
Sea lions are better equipped for action. "They actually can have a little cuff they carry around, and can actually cuff the potential waterborne intruder," they say.
The U.S. military has already deployed these underwater sentries at a Naval base in Georgia, and it plans to use them next year at a submarine base in Washington state.
Syria wants the US and its allies to pay for the destruction of Syrian infrastructure and to bear legal responsibility for "illegitimately" bombing civilian targets, Damascus has told the UN, demanding that the American-led coalition strikes stop.
The Syrian "Government insists that these attacks must come to an end, and that the members of this illegitimate coalition must bear the political and legal responsibility for the destruction of infrastructure in the Syrian Arab Republic, including responsibility for compensation," the Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations said in letters addressed to the UN Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council.

Stating that the ongoing US-led anti-terrorist airstrikes "continue to claim the lives of hundreds of innocent Syrian civilians," Damascus claimed that the bombings had led to a "near-total destruction" of homes and vital infrastructure, including the "utter destruction" of oil and gas facilities.
The attacks, along with US and EU-imposed economic restrictions on Syria "are impeding the maintenance of those economic facilities and jeopardizing the prospects for development and reconstruction" in the country, the letters, written last week, said.
To support their claims, Syria'correspondence referred to two recent cases where the coalition's jets destroyed oil and gas facilities. Damascus also said the May 27 bombardment of Hasu Albu Awf village in the Hasakah governorate, "completely" destroyed many homes and killed at least eight civilians, "most of them children."
On Friday, the US-led coalition announced the demolition of a number of oil and gas facilities in various parts of Syria which allegedly belonged to the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorist group.
Targeting the terrorists' illegal oil trade and jihadist infrastructure has been a cornerstone of both American and Russian strategies in Syria. But while Moscow coordinates its strikes with the Syrian government, the Washington-led operation has been harshly criticized for its indiscriminate bombing practices and doing so without communicating with Syrian government forces.

Damascus' letters to the UN once again underlined that the American air campaign is being conducted in violation of international law, as it lacks any form of consent or authorization from the Syrian government.
Raqqa, known as the stronghold of IS, has been the main focus of the US operation in Syria, where Washington is guiding and supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

While the US-led Operation Inherent Resolve this month confirmed a total of 603 civilian deaths in the US-led air campaign in Syria and Iraq, Airwars, a UK-based group that monitors airstrikes and civilian casualties, claimed this week that it tracked ‚Äúmore than 700 likely civilian deaths‚Äù in Raqqa alone ‚Äì even before the battle for the city began in June.
However, there is little chance that the document would lead to any repercussions for Washington, international relations professor Jamal Wakeem told RT.
"I don't believe that the United Nations will take any action against the United States, because we know it has been the tradition of the UN not to act against any aggression done by the US against any country," Wakeem said.
Even if the UN moves forward with Syria's claims, "the US, as a permanent member of the UN [Security] Council, would veto any resolution that could be proposed against it," Wakeem added.
Nevertheless, Syria's move "could affect the US, not on a political, but on a moral level," the professor said.

An oil slick spotted in the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was determined not to be from an aircraft, the top investigator said Monday.
The investigator, looking into why two men boarded the flight with stolen passports, also said authorities had reviewed video footage from check-in to departure and found that ‚Äúall security protocols have been complied with.‚Äù
Almost three full days after the plane, a Boeing 777 with 239 people on board, disappeared over the South China Sea, there remained no confirmed wreckage and no explanation of what happened.
The video footage showed that the men were not of Asian appearance, said the investigator, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the head of the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation. They also said that the search area is being expanded.
‚ÄúWe are looking at every possibility,‚Äù they told reporters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
The U.S. Navy said that a second destroyer, the USS Kidd, has joined the American search contingent. The USS Pinckney was already there. Both destroyers are equipped with two Seahawk helicopters and a patrol plane. China, Malaysia and Vietnam are among the other countries looking for clues.
Malaysian authorities were looking into the possibility of a stolen-passport syndicate, but it was not clear how that might be related to the flight.
Earlier on Monday, helicopters and ships raced toward a yellow object in the water that looked like a life raft, but it turned out to be the moss-covered cap of a cable reel and not from the plane.

Expert Knowledge in Intelligence Assessments: Bird Flu and Bioterrorism Summary
A study of the 2011 controversy surrounding publication of Ron Fouchier and Yoshihiro Kawaoka's H5N1 avian influenza experiments reveals that U.S. intelligence analysts do not have adequate resources to evaluate dual-use scientific experiments, or to navigate the politics that characterize the use of technical expertise in biosecurity issues.

Starrcade is a name that will always resonate with wrestling fans. The event, which debuted in 1983, in Greensboro, North Carolina, under the banner of Jim Crockett Promotions of the National Wrestling Alliance, evolved from an annual Thanksgiving Day supershow to become World Championship Wrestling's flagship pay-per-view. Starrcade was the stage that helped Ric Flair grow from a regional star into a national icon.
In its early days, Flair was the main event every year from 1983 through 1990 -- and almost every year, they faced off with a new challenger. Flair-Race, Flair-Rhodes, Flair-Luger, Flair-Sting and Flair-Vader are some of the most iconic matches in Starrcade's history. Yet the most memorable Starrcade match in the minds of many fans didn't involve the Nature Boy at all.
That distinction belongs to the main event of 1997's Starrcade, which took place 20 years ago this December -- pitting Hollywood Hulk Hogan against Sting. Though it stood as the moment that Sting and WCW finally turned the tide on the New World Order (NWO), that match is now remembered for all the wrong reasons. As WWE gets set to bring back Starrcade for the first time under their banner on Saturday in Greensboro, let's take a look back at how WCW reached that fateful night.
The build
Building a matchup month in advance wasn't new to wrestling in the late '90s -- Vince McMahon regularly, and still to this day, plants seeds for WrestleMania throughout the calendar year, and Starrcade often served as the blowoff to long-term feuds -- but for WCW under the Eric Bischoff regime, the idea of long-term booking was a novel concept. The likes of Kevin Nash, Scott Hall and, namely, Hulk Hogan had creative control of their characters written into their contracts, which made long-term planning almost impossible. Still, Bischoff knew they had to make fans wait to see the match between NWO's leader, Hogan, and the revitalized Sting until WCW's biggest event of the year.
The NWO was still hot in 1997, a year after Hogan was infamously revealed as the third man at Bash at the Beach in 1996, but the villainous faction badly needed a believable adversary to avoid losing steam. Goldberg was early on in their undefeated streak at the time, so they aren't an option. The NWO had already either run through everyone else on the roster or turned them to join the black-and-white movement. That left Sting, a WCW star from its early days (having main-evented 1989's Starrcade opposite Flair), as the only reputable foe to battle the NWO.
But their white-meat babyface persona at the time was growing stale. Hall, after watching the 1994 movie "The Crow," gave Sting the idea to change their colorful look to a darker, more-ominous appearance. The idea breathed new life into Sting's career and gave WCW the modern face it needed to counter the NWO.
Sting came out to the ring on Monday Nitro on Sept. 16, 1996, and deliver a promo that hinted at the drastic character change that was about to come.
"I've carried the WCW banner, and I have given my blood, my sweat and my tears for WCW," Sting said to the Nitro crowd. "So for all of those fans out there and all those wrestlers and people that never doubted the Stinger, I'll stand by you if you stand by me. But for all of the people, all of the commentators, all of the wrestlers and all of the best friends who did doubt me, you can stick it. From now on, I consider myself a free agent. But that doesn't mean you won't see the Stinger from time to time. I'm gonna pop in when you least expect it."

The times Sting would "pop in" over the next year and a half were the most thrilling moments on WCW programming. Sting stopped talking and wrestling, instead choosing to antagonize the NWO week after week in segments that helped build a story more than any promo or match ever could. The combination of NWO's white-hot run atop WCW and Sting's mysterious, slow-burn approach made Hogan-Sting one of the most anticipated matches in pro wrestling history.
That wait finally came to an end on Dec. 28, 1997, at Starrcade.
The match
WCW did everything right in the 18 months leading up to the match, and in the moments before this clash of the titans finally happened, it seemed like that would continue. Sting's entrance was goosebumps-inducing to the 17,500 fans in attendance in Washington, D.C. The staggering lights display, sounds of crashing thunder and spooky narration enhanced Sting's already stellar entrance. The moment felt important, as it should have after so much build, but that feeling quickly dissipated as the match got underway.

"I don't really know what happened that day," Sting said in the 2015 documentary "Sting: Into the Light." "I'm not sure to this day."
From the onset of the match, something felt off, and with good reason -- a match that had been over a year in the making, with every step meticulously calculated along the way, didn't have a planned finish. Hogan, Sting and Bischoff never came to an agreement.
"There were nerves that day. A lot of politics going on that day too, so that made it even worse," Sting said. "Literally, as all this is going on, there's still some level of confusion in the back as to what we're gonna do. How are we going to end this match? We went into it believing one thing, and then suddenly there was trouble."
Bischoff, as they did during most of their WCW tenure, struggled to play peacemaker between the domineering personalities of Hogan and Sting.
"Once we finally got to the ring after agonizing throughout the afternoon in what the finish and the outcome was gonna be, Hulk didn't really want to commit," Bischoff said in the documentary. "I think Sting was disappointed in that. Hulk was disappointed and couldn't understand why Sting didn't see it. I was stuck in the middle of those two, and we had to make the call we made."

What ensued was one of the most puzzling sequences in the history of the business.
A little over 10 minutes into the match, Hogan hit Sting with their signature big boot, taunted for about 10 seconds and then landed their finishing leg drop. Referee Nick Patrick, who helped out the NWO in the past, was supposed to do a quick-count to give Hogan an unfair victory. Instead, Patrick counted the pinfall at a normal pace, making Hogan the clean victor over Sting. This led to confusion among fans throughout the arena and the millions who had ordered the show on PPV.
The match would freefall from there, as a debuting Bret Hart came out and refused to let the timekeeper ring the bell, which was no doubt a reference to the Montreal Screwjob that took place a month earlier. The match was restarted with Hart as the referee (with no explanation as to why they were allowed to officiate), and Sting quickly hit a couple of Stinger splashes before winning via the Scorpion Deathlock as Hogan submitted verbally. Sting was the new WCW world heavyweight champion, and the entire non-NWO locker room piled inside the ring to celebrate.
But amid all the chaos, it didn't feel that way.
The aftermath
Sting walked out of Starrcade 1997, WCW's biggest pay-per-view ever, as WCW champion -- but the confusing, over-booked finish to the match involving Bret Hart was sadly an indicator of things to come for the company in the years that followed. Courtesy of WWE
The questionable booking decision didn't seem costly to WCW at the time. Starrcade '97 was the most profitable show in WCW history, with 17,500 paid fans in attendance (totaling a $543,000 gate) and a 1.9 PPV buy rate. But 20 years later, that moment would turn out to be the first sign of the dysfunction that would only get worse for WCW in the years that followed.
As everyone knows by now, WCW ceased to exist less than four years later. The company's last Starrcade in 2000, in the same venue as 1997's, drew an almost unfathomable 3,465 paid fans with a 0.11 buy rate. The unwillingness of the NWO to put over other talent, and Bischoff allowing it all to happen, worked as one of the biggest factors in WCW's swift demise.
Starrcade returns for the first time in 17 years this Saturday as a live event marked by two title matches inside of a steel cage, with appearances by NWA and WCW legends like Flair and the Rock 'n' Roll Express. The virality of WWE's version of Starrcade, even without the show airing on the WWE Network, embodies how many fans still identify with the Starrcade name after all these years.
If not for WCW's blown opportunity in the 1997 event, and a Chris-Jericho-sized list worth of missteps afterward, Starrcade might still be a WCW pay-per-view going head-to-head with WrestleMania. Instead, it's nothing more than nostalgia.
"Big, big buildup, and the thing that I worried about was that it wasn't gonna follow the build-up. It was right on the borderline of doing that," said Sting in an almost somber tone, as they reflected on their infamous match with Hogan. "But it's wrestling history now."

Short-term cognitive training programs are now capturing a great interest. These programs are based on different perspectives (adaptive n back, working memory, visuospatial programs, etc.). Here we compare working memory (WM) and visuospatial (VIS) training programs based on two video games for video-console: WM training was based on 'Cages' whereas VIS training relied on 'Train'. Both games are from Big Brain Academy? for Nintendo Wii. Twenty-four females completed a set of cognitive measures (fluid intelligence, spatial intelligence, and spatial working memory), group administered, before and after video games training across 6 sessions. This training took place under strict supervision in the laboratory. The general pattern of results shows that VIS training is related with increments in intelligent performance. This finding is consistent with previous evidence showing the relevance of these visuospatial processing components with respect to changes in intelligence as measured by standardized tests.
Was Hillary Clinton a stand up comic in another life? They told an Arizona radio station in an interview that our southwest border was "secure" because "net illegal immigration" had been cut to zero.
In an interview with KTAR radio in Phoenix, Mrs. Clinton said improvements under President George W. Bush and President Obama, including several hundred miles of fencing, have cut net illegal immigration from Mexico to zero. ‚ÄúNow I think it's time to turn our attention to comprehensive immigration reform,‚Äù they said, using the term immigrant rights advocates use for legislation to legalize the 11 million illegal immigrants now in the country. Them evaluation of the border stands in stark contrast to Republican presidential candidates who say the border is not secure, pointing to increasing seizures of drugs and to the renewed surge of Central American illegal immigrants. But Mrs. Clinton said they're ignoring how bad it used to be during their husband's administration. ‚ÄúI think we've done a really good job securing the border and I think those that say we haven't been not paying attention to everything that was done for the last 15 years under both President Bush and President Obama,‚Äù they told KTAR. ‚ÄúWe have increased dramatically the number of border security officers, we have added physical obstructions like fences in many places, and in fact the immigration from Mexico has dropped considerably. It's just not happening any more.‚Äù
Looking over the last 20 years of illegal immigration from Mexico, Clinton may have a point. Apprehensions at the border are way up and net immigration from Mexico has fallen.
But that's hardly the entire picture:
But the number of Central Americans attempting the illegal crossing has surged over the last three years, leading some experts to say the border problems have shifted, not gone away. Border Patrol agents say the new illegal immigrants are drawn by the chance to take advantage of lax enforcement of immigration laws within the U.S., which gives them the opportunity to disappear into the shadows with the 11 million other illegal immigrants already here. Mrs. Clinton, who will face voters in the Democratic primary in Arizona next week, has come under fire from some Hispanic activists for having voted as a senator for the Secure Fence Act, which called for building 700 miles of double-tier fencing along the southwest border.
The first line of defense of our borders has a much different view of the matter. Border agents are supporting Donald Trump for their strong stand against illegal immigration:
The largest U.S. Border Patrol union local is praising Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for being the "only candidate" to support their tough mission, an almost endorsement that is the latest boost for the front runner's campaign. "Mr. Trump is the only candidate that has publicly expressed their support of our mission and our agents. They have been an outspoken candidate on the need for a Secure Border and for this we are grateful," said a statement from Art Del Cueto, president of Local 2544 of the National Border Patrol Council, the representative of 18,000 agents.
Perhaps before the next time Hillary Clinton makes a fool of themselves spouting immigration nonsense, they should consult the people who know the situation best; those charged with defending our borders from illegal aliens.

MANILA ‚Äî The six individuals held for allegedly operating a clandestine shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride) factory in San Juan City should consider themselves lucky.
President Duterte would have shot them dead on the spot had they joined the raid led by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) on Dec. 23.
ADVERTISEMENT
NBI and PDEA operatives reportedly seized some 10 kilograms of shabu worth P3.6 billion during the operation.
Blurting out their usual profanities, the President on Tuesday told survivors of Typhoon ‚ÄúNina‚Äù in Pili town, Camarines Sur province, of their violent approach to stemming the country's narcotics problem.
‚ÄúLike what happened in San Juan. They were lucky I was not (there). If there was that big haul of shabu, I will really kill you,‚Äù they said in between expletives.
‚ÄúLet's not resort to drama. I, myself, will shoot them if nobody would shoot them,‚Äù they said in a raised voice.
The President had repeatedly denied ordering the murders of drug suspects, only to contradict themselves by publicly threatening to kill them for ‚Äúdestroying the youth of my country.‚Äù
They said there was no law in the country prohibiting them from making such morbid warnings to criminals and drug suspects.
Mr. Duterte, who had earned the monicker ‚ÄúThe Punisher‚Äù for advocating vigilantism to combat criminality, boasted before a group of business people that they used to roam the streets of Davao City when they were its mayor to look for criminals to kill.
As in their previous controversial statements, they later backtracked and claimed they only killed three kidnappers during a legitimate police operation.
This prompted UN rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein to call on Philippine authorities to ‚Äúdemonstrate their commitment to upholding the rule of law and their independence from the executive by launching a murder investigation.‚Äù
ADVERTISEMENT
‚ÄúThe killings committed by Mr. Duterte, by their own admission, at a time when they were a mayor, clearly constitute murder,‚Äù Zeid said.
‚ÄúIt should be unthinkable for any functioning judicial system not to launch investigative and judicial proceedings when someone has openly admitted being a killer,‚Äù they said. SFM

This week Apple has announced that they are initiating a new repair extension program for the MacBook Pro, in order to address video corruption and stability problems with certain models. The program offers extended repair service for the 15‚Äù and 17‚Äù 2011 MacBook Pros, along with the 2012 and Early 2013 15‚Äù Retina MacBook Pros.
Under the terms of the program, covered laptops that are experiencing video issues such as display corruption, system crashes, or other glitches will be eligible for free repairs through Apple. Furthermore all affected systems are eligible regardless of warranty status, making this a true extension in every sense of the word as the bulk of the systems this program covers are past their extended warranty expiration dates. Meanwhile in order to compensate any users who have already suffered from the issue, Apple is also offering reimbursements to those customers who have already paid for repairs.

The MacBook Pro repair program comes less than 2 years after Apple's last repair program, which in 2013 saw Apple offering free video card replacements and repairs for the mid-2011 27‚Äù iMac. And given the similarities between the problems in the MacBook Pro and the iMac, this has raised a few eyebrows. While the 2011 iMac and MacBook Pros use different GPUs, both systems use GPUs from AMD's Radeon HD 6000M series, with the iMac using the higher-end 6970M while the MacBook Pros used the 6490M, 6750M, and 6770M GPUs.
However throwing a wrench into any common thread between these systems, the last of the MacBook Pros covered by the repair program, the first generation 15‚Äù Retina MacBook Pros, used NVIDIA's GeForce GT 650M instead. There is also the matter of differences in construction ‚Äì iMacs used MXM cards, MacBook Pros use GPUs soldered on to the logic board ‚Äì and even differences in operation. Namely, while the iMac used It's dGPU exclusively the MacBook Pros all used switchable graphics, which means that the MacBook Pros are often being driven by their iGPU rather than their dGPU.

Consequently while we first suspected that this is a common issue revolving around the Radeon HD 6000M series ‚Äì and certainly we can't rule that out ‚Äì there seems to be more that's going on here than a common failure in one line of GPUs. This could include Apple opting to address multiple modes of failure under a single repair program, or even just pure coincidence. At the same time we haven't seen a widespread repair program issued by other OEMs for any of these GPUs, which may mean that Apple is the only OEM being seriously affected, unlike NVIDIA's bumpgate which saw repair programs from a number of OEMs.
For that reason I find myself wondering whether another factor such as cooling has been playing a role here. Although these Apple devices all use different coolers, one common element in Apple's iMac and Retina MacBook Pro designs has been the comapny's aggressiveness in controlling the thickness of those devices, leading to them pushing the envelope on cooling relatively high TDP processors in tight spaces.
In any case, the full details of the program, including the affected models and repair instructions, are available over at Apple's website.
The drones available to the average consumer have improved by leaps and bounds over the last five years. Onboard computer systems allowed them to autonomously navigate a path of GPS waypoints or follow along with its owner and capture spectacular aerial footage. But up until now the drones available to you and me were blind to their surroundings. If a big tree or ski lift got in its path, the drone wouldn't change course to avoid it. All that changes today, with the release of DJI's first guidance system, a combination of ultrasonic sensors and stereo cameras that allow the drone to detect objects up to 65 feet (20 meters) away and keep your aircraft at a preconfigured distance.
Robust sense and avoid technology is the key to integrating drones into everyday life, enabling ambitious projects like Amazon's Prime Air. It would allow drones, like their robotic kin the driverless car, to move about our towns and cities, delivering packages, capturing news footage, or perhaps handing out parking tickets. DJI says that research teams are already using the guidance system for "unique applications, including an aerial solution created at Fudan University in Shanghai that uses Intel processors to detect illegally parked cars from the air."
The guidance system works with DJI's new Matrice 100 drone, also announced today. It's a developer-friendly craft built to be modified for specific tasks across different industries, and to act as a testbed for experimental work. It's part of a big push by DJI to be known not just as a hardware manufacturer, but as a platform for the entire drone industry.
This piece originally appeared in Reuters Magazine, a special edition publication ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
In late October, a deflated Julian Assange called a press conference in London to announce they may have to mothball WikiLeaks. The reason, they said, was money. Visa, MasterCard, Western Union and Paypal were preventing supporters from donating to the organization, Assange explained. They warned that unless the bankers' blockade was lifted at once, the cash-strapped organization would soon die.
By then, however, the biggest problem WikiLeaks faced wasn't financial. After all, the group had always operated on a shoestring, its leader famously sleeping somewhere other than at home or in a hotel most nights. The main concern was productivity: WikiLeaks and Assange, its 40-year-old provocateur, were out of scoops.
And oh, what a string of scoops it had run off in the previous 18 months. WikiLeaks' 2010 posting of a classified video showing civilian casualties during an Apache helicopter attack in Baghdad, which Assange titled ‚ÄúCollateral Murder,‚Äù drew debate and viewers around the world. Then came its distribution of classified documents from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Guant√°namo Bay prison camp files, and the classified U.S. State Department diplomatic cables to the Guardian, the New York Times, Der Spiegel, and other news outlets.
But after the diplomatic cable stories petered out in September, so too did WikiLeaks. Its slide into irrelevance after months of dominating the headlines should have been enough to humble even Assange. Their five-year-old supranational group, with its hardened computer infrastructure and sophisticated encryption algorithms, was supposedly immune to government crackdowns and corporate retaliation. But instead of flourishing, as Assange had predicted, WikiLeaks all but vaporized in its 16th minute of fame: Its auteur was shackled with a security bracelet, fighting extradition to Sweden, where authorities want to question them regarding charges of sexual assault; WikiLeaks members and allies, alienated by the dictatorial Assange, had abandoned him; and leakers were no longer making their substantial deposits in WikiLeaks computers.
You can date the beginning of this decline to mid-2010, when Assange's alleged supersource, U.S. Army Private First Class Bradley Manning ‚Äî suspected of having leaked the Afghanistan, Iraq, Gitmo, and diplomatic cable files ‚Äî was jailed. Assange was still boasting to Forbes in November 2010 that WikiLeaks was receiving so many leaks that it had to turn off the submission form on its site and that ‚Äúabout 50 percent‚Äù of the documents in its hoard were from the private sector (banking, oil, pharmaceuticals). But despite those boasts, they never delivered those corporate expos√©s. The Manning trove was their last big data dump, a reminder that journalists are only as good as their sources. Last year, after teasing 60 Minutes about explosive documents they hinted could take down a bank (Bank of America?), they reportedly backpedaled in private. Was they overselling their material, or was they holding back the bank documents for maximum impact later? Only Julian Assange, international man of mystery, knew for sure.
The WikiLeaks fade-out demonstrates the advantage established news institutions have over wildcatters like Assange. They may have found the oil, but they had no way of making it useful to the masses. The established press ‚Äî love them or hate them ‚Äî had the means to quickly figure out what the Manning files meant and the skill to present them in readable form, something Assange appears to be incapable of doing. The pressies also had lawyers who knew how to beat back the legal threats of governments, namely the United States, that did not want the files published. Of course, Assange mocked attempts by the Times and the Guardian to discuss the leaks with the governments involved prior to publication as selling out. In a new documentary, ‚ÄúTrue Stories: WikiLeaks,‚Äù Assange snarls that the mainstream media ‚Äúcannot be trusted‚Äù because they are ‚Äúpart of the social network of the elite.‚Äù Even if he's right, that elite is not a static entity with a single set of interests. That governments around the globe recoiled at the Times and Guardian stories based on WikiLeaks material puts the lie to Assange's sweeping condemnation.
I mean no disrespect to Assange by calling them a wildcatter ‚Äî or by calling them a journalist! (If digging up state secrets and revealing them to the public isn't an act of journalism, what is?) The wildcatter label captures the entrepreneurial qualities they brought to their work. Charlie Beckett, of the London School of Economics and Political Science, notes that Assange drew on their skills as a programmer and hacker to spot ‚Äúa new business model and a novel kind of platform.‚Äù As Beckett points out, there are plenty of programmers and hackers out there, so ‚Äúwhat made WikiLeaks work was Assange's ideological drive and their all-consuming desire to use digital communications as a political weapon.‚Äù
Although it's difficult to think of Assange without imagining gigabytes of classified data coursing around the Web, this cybercentric view denies them their proper status in the pantheon of secrecy hackers. They have never been a leaker; instead, they positioned themselves as a broker of leaks. At first, they believed WikiLeaks could be a passive platform, dispersing anonymous leaks to an interested world. Assange had moderate success early on interesting journalists in their files ‚Äî mainstream outlets generated numerous stories from WikiLeaks documents that outraged governments (the Chinese and the British), religions (Scientologists and Mormons), banks, and other power centers. But it wasn't until Assange started working with the mainstream media on the Afghanistan and Iraq files ‚Äî aping the traditional source-journalist relationship ‚Äî that they started maximizing the ‚Äúyield‚Äù from their files.
Assange's current intimacy with editors and reporters places them closer to the tradition of the all-star leakers of the 1970s ‚Äî Daniel Ellsberg (the Pentagon Papers), Philip Agee (outing CIA officers), Navy Yeoman Charles Radford (the Indo-Pakistan conflict) ‚Äî who teamed with journalists or publishers to get their secrets out. Like them, Assange was (and is) on a suicide mission to destabilize the system.
But unlike Assange, the asupervisorstioned focused their outrage on a single issue: Ellsberg exposed the lies at the heart of the United States' Vietnam policy; Agee, a born-again Marxist, opposed what they considered to be U.S. imperialism; Radford (who served their Mormon mission in India) objected to the Nixon administration's favoritism toward Pakistan. These lone wolves understood they had booked one-way trips ‚Äî that having unloaded their stash of secrets, their next stops were jail, exile or obscurity.
Assange's self-defined role as go-between rather than leaker, and their ambition to build a perpetual secret-exposing machine, further differentiates them from the all-stars. Steven Aftergood, who runs the Federation of American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, says: ‚ÄúThe WikiLeaks disclosures were presented ‚Äî above all ‚Äî as a challenge to official secrecy rather than as a focused revelation of any particular scandal or misdeed or an effort to redirect U.S. foreign policy.‚Äù
Despite their many troubles, Assange is still swinging. In December, they gave the Washington Post sales brochures from which the paper fashioned a page-one story about the worldwide market for invasive surveillance technology. (Not exactly groundbreaking, but worthy enough.)
Whatever WikiLeaks' current status, it's fair to ask what it has accomplished. Can we identify any significant changes in politics or policy prompted by its revelations? (To be fair, that's a tough question to ask of any news organization.) Its most tangible accomplishment must be that it has given the world a better look at how the United States prosecutes its wars and conducts its diplomacy. ‚ÄúThe releases included quite a few records of enduring interest, but many others of only passing curiosity, and perhaps a majority that are of no particular significance at all,‚Äù says Aftergood. ‚ÄúWe probably need more time and perspective to reach a final judgment on WikiLeaks' lasting impact ‚Ä¶ The Pentagon Papers were a phenomenon, but what was their impact, really? Did anyone actually read them? Or did their significance arise from the over-reaction of the Nixon Administration?‚Äù
But who can deny the impact of the leakers of the 1970s? A new breed of national security reporter, inspired by the revelations of those whistleblowers, began filing tough dispatches. The Freedom of Information Act, established in the late 1960s, was strengthened, giving reporters additional leverage in their investigations. And Senate hearings exposed the multidecade excesses of the CIA, the FBI and the military intelligence agencies.
WikiLeaks hasn't inspired much in the way of official government investigations, open-government legislation or even successful imitators. Governments and corporations have proved how good they are at stifling leakers and their depositories. The most direct effect, Aftergood notes, is a tightening of U.S. government computer security: Security had been loosened after 9/11 to make dot-connecting easier in the hope of preventing another attack. Aftergood also notes that the diplomatic cable leaks caused the U.S. to transfer some personnel and curtail diplomacy, and that the revelations strained U.S. diplomatic relations with some nations. In this case, WikiLeaks may have shaken the earth, but Assange's organization did not really change it.
Or maybe it did. Gideon Rachman gave a wonderfully perverse reading of the impact of the publication of the diplomatic cables last December in the Financial Times, declaring that Assange and WikiLeaks had done America ‚Äúa massive favour‚Äù by ‚Äúinadvertently debunking decades-old conspiracy theories about its foreign policy ‚Ä¶ Where WikiLeaks does reveal a gap between America's public statements and private discussions, it tends to be because U.S. representatives are being diplomatic rather than duplicitous.‚Äù Although the candor in many of those cables embarrassed the United States, the complete dump flattered it because it showed the public positions of the United States are nearly identical to the private positions expressed in the cables. This consistency, Rachman argues, dispels the ‚Äúidea that something sinister is going on behind the walls of the U.S. embassy.‚Äù
Rachman's formulation sounds flip, but it isn't. Obviously, some of those cables and action reports embarrassed the U.S. government or did damage to its coveted ‚Äúsources and methods‚Äù of information collection and diplomacy. But when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton ripped the leak of the diplomatic cables as ‚Äúan attack on the international community,‚Äù they gave hyperbole a bad name. Secretary Clinton's claim that the confidential conversations between governments of the sort that WikiLeaks exposed ‚Äúsafeguard global security and advance economic prosperity‚Äù reads like a hack passage out of a civics textbook. The reason governments, totalitarian and democratic, labor to keep their diplomatic works ‚Äî trivial and important ‚Äî wrapped in secrecy has less to do with ensuring world peace and prosperity than with avoiding scrutiny by their citizens. If international diplomacy can be redefined as politics by other means, what governments most object to is not the leak of cables but a full public discussion of what governments do in private in the public's name.
Setting aside for a moment Assange's bad manners, their megalomania and their supreme skills as a bridge-burner, we are in their debt for reigniting debate over the prosecution of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Better than any leaker ‚Äî or broker of leaks ‚Äî before him, Assange figured out a new mechanism for the many to monitor the powerful few.
‚ÄúThe dominant message conveyed by WikiLeaks was, ‚ÄòYou cannot keep your secrets from us,'‚Äù says Aftergood. ‚ÄúBut the gathering official response is, ‚ÄòOh, yes we can.'‚Äù Aftergood is right. The careers of leakers are traditionally short-lived. Even if they aren't caught and prosecuted, the Ellsbergs and Mannings who leak get evicted from the secrets trove. The dependency of the press and other institutions, including governments, on leakers is well documented. Journalists, of course, need leaks to perform their watchdog function. But governments depend on them, too, to check and balance the bureaucracy that has grown unaccountable.
What WikiLeaks demonstrated in its 16th minute of fame is the extreme dependency of leakers on strong institutions. It may be too late to rescue WikiLeaks by sending Assange to the Emily Post Institute for remedial studies in good manners. But their example stands ‚Äî for any news organization or pirate outfit bold enough to follow their lead.

It just won't stop. The latest congressional harassment case to hit the news involves Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-FL) and a former staff member of a congressional commission. The twist in this story is that the woman wasn't a congressional staffer but congressional employee. They were a member of the Helsinki Commission ‚Äì a congressional commission that promotes international human rights. Oh, the irony
Winsome Packer, a Republican Hill staffer until 2006 when Democrats took over Congress, was born in Jamaica. They knew Hastings through a mutual friend and Hastings encouraged them to apply to the Helsinki Commission. Hastings was the chairperson of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Packer got the job and was stationed in Vienna. Them job required them to travel with Hastings to other countries. They allege that they asked to stay at their apartment or visit their hotel room, frequently hugged them and once asked inappropriate questions about my underwear.
From Roll Call:
Packer sued under a federal statute that allows individuals to seek damages against federal officials for violations of civil rights. But Hastings was dropped from the lawsuit in 2012, after they argued that the law didn't apply to a member of Congress. The suit continued against the commission. The House Ethics Committee closed its investigation in December 2014. It interviewed eight witnesses and concluded that the most serious allegations against Hastings were ‚Äúnot supported by evidence‚Äù although they ‚Äúdid admit to certain conduct that was less than professional.‚Äù
Packer was awarded $220,000 in 2014. Hastings maintains the innocence of sexual harassment. They claim they were never told of the settlement. Them settlement wasn't included in the payments released by the Office of Compliance, interestingly enough. So far, of that list, a complaint of Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-TX) is listed as the highest award at $84,000.
What other large amounts have been paid with taxpayer money in secret? We don't know because the process is still secret. Why haven't House Republicans shut down the funding?
Hastings has a sketchy history. They were a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern Florida District from 1979 to 1989 when they were impeached for bribery and perjury.
Who will be next?
Juice cleanses, colon cleanses, fruit detoxes, sugar detoxes‚Äîwe've all seen these things, but do they actually work? What are they supposed to do? Let's take a look at the science behind the fad.
Cleanses and detoxes are trendy, popular, and promise to clear out nasty toxins from your body and make you healthier. It's a tall promise. So, we decided to talk with Las Vegas-based registered dietitian Andy Bellatti, nutrition researcher Kamal Patel, and science writer and educator Beth Skwarecki to see if they can measure up to the claims.

What Cleanses and Detoxes Promise
There are tons of different cleanses and detoxes. For the most part, a cleanse and a detox are the same thing. They're typically used interchangeably and have the same basic goals: to remove "harmful" things from your body. Sometimes, they aim to target a specific organ like the liver or colon, and supposedly, detoxing makes you feel better.

There's no specific definition of a detox or cleanse, but they often involve limiting your food intake to pressed juice, avoiding specific types of food, or drinking a concoction of juices that supposedly rids your body of toxins. These supposed toxins are rarely described by cleansers in detail, but generally referred to as "poisons" or "pollutants." In the medical field, toxins can refer to just about anything, from alcohol, to foods, to medicines, to asbestos. "Detoxing" can also refer to treatment for drug addiction, but that's very different‚Äîhere, we're specifically discussing these food-and-drink cleanses.
There are far too many of these cleanses and detoxes to dig through, but here are 10 that Shape Magazine deemed popular in the last year, to give you an idea of what they're all about. As an example, let's take a closer look at the Master Cleanse, one of the most longstanding and popular cleanses out there. Here's an excerpt from the book that describes exactly how the Master Cleanse works:
The cleanse starts with a herbal laxative tea both morning and evening. If this is not sufficient to clean out the intestinal tract, they advise a salt-water wash. These stops are necessary to remove the toxins loosened by the lemon juice cleanse. I was then to drink between six and twelve glasses of lemonade, which consisted of lemon and maple syrup in proper proportions, with a small amount of cayenne added to wash out the mucus loosened by the cleanse.

Sounds gross, right? Well, it might be worth it for you if you believe the promises purported by Master Cleanse creator Stanley Burroughs:
For the novice and the advanced student alike, cleansing is basis for elimination of every kind of disease. The purpose of this book is to simplify the cause and the correction of all disorders, regardless of the name or names. As we eliminate and correct one disease, we correct them all, for every disease is corrected by the same process of cleansing and building positive good health.
The hyperbole goes on from there, but you get the idea. Kamal Patel sums most cleanses up like so:
What ties these diets together is a dual aim: weight loss plus a notion that we have built-up toxins in the body which are slowing us down and possibly killing us. So a typical cleanse, let's say of juices only, is meant to shift your intestines away from digestion and absorption and towards "ridding the body of toxins". That's where the benefits are claimed to lie, but they may actually lie elsewhere.

Most cleanses have similar promises, claiming that going on some sort of juice fast (or other cleanse) can free your body of harmful toxins.
What Happens in Your Body When You're On a Cleanse

We're all aware that fruit and vegetables are good for us, so following that logic suggests that a diet of just fruit and vegetables must be super healthy, right? Right??
Not really. If you drink nothing but juice for a week, you'll lose weight, but it's because you're not eating, not because your body is "detoxing". Water is stored in your muscles with glycogen. When you eat a low calorie diet, you use up those glycogen stores, and lose the water weight with it. You'll gain that water weight right back when you return to your normal diet. You're also missing out on all those other vital nutrients like fat, fiber, and protein. In fact, some cleanses suggest that you avoid exercise when you're on them because your caloric intake is so low‚Äîwhich leads to fatigue and dizziness.
After a few days, your body is basically running on fumes, and without protein your body might start to break down muscle tissue instead. Likewise, the lack of fiber in your diet tends to impact the function of your large intestine, which might explain why people tend to describe their gut feelings on a juice cleanse as similar to the stomach flu.

Most importantly, a juice cleanse doesn't do anything that your body doesn't already do on its own. Andy Bellatti reminds us that our bodies are already pretty good at removing toxins. If they weren't, and you needed a yearly detox, we'd all probably be dead:
Will drinking nothing but juice for three or five days land you in the hospital or result in irreversible nutrient deficiencies? No, but it is also unnecessary. Our bodies remove toxins on a daily basis thanks to the kidneys, lungs, and liver. The whole point of going to the bathroom is to flush out toxins!
Beth Skwarecki adds that while most of these cleanses and detoxes aren't dangerous, they can cause some problems. Since juices don't include much fiber, the body ends up absorbing more fructose sugar, which‚Äîas we all know‚Äîisn't good for you:
The ones that are mostly sugar (like with lots of fruit juices, or the lemonade thing) may put you on a sugar crash roller coaster and negate the potential good effects of fasting that have to do with insulin sensitivity and such. The good news on depriving yourself is that it takes months to get any serious vitamin deficiencies. Most of these cleanses are probably stupid but not seriously harmful (if all you're doing is restricting food for a few days). As for the claims of eliminating toxins, well, even the ones that name specific toxins don't actually give any mechanism by which the diet/herbs they're pushing affect what your body does with them.

Skwarecki's final point is key: most commercial detoxes don't list what a toxin is. And even when they do, they don't give an evidence that they work. If they did, we could test the effectiveness of their claims. In a 2009 investigation by Sense about Science, they checked 15 commercial detox products and found that none could name toxins, agree on a definition of detox, or supply any evidence for their claims.
All of this is to say: the only thing a detox or juice cleanse actually does to your body is make you hungry and nutrient deprived for a few days.
Better Alternatives to Cleanses

So, cleanses don't really do anything productive and a special juice mixture won't remove toxins from your system. That doesn't mean you can't do other things to get your health back on track.
In fact, the idea of a cleanse is basically just a reboot of your diet, which Bellatti agrees with:
There is something to be said for doing "food resets." That is, going back to the basic tenets of healthful eating (mainly eating whole, minimally processed, largely plant-based foods) to reaccustom the taste buds to more subtle flavors. That, however, should not be confused with a cleanse.

But they do add:
Nutrition and health is about the big picture. What you do for five or seven days out of the year is pretty inconsequential. Rather than worry about 'detoxing,' people would be better off thinking about eating nutritious, health-promoting foods on a daily basis. Think leafy greens, beans, whole fruit, nuts, and seeds. The idea that six months of unhealthy eating can somehow be remedied by drinking nothing but green juice for 72 hours is erroneous.

Likewise, an actual fast, as in, just drinking water, has some research showing that it's useful. Patel explains:
Cleanses sometimes involve fasting or near-fasting, and that can actually have benefits, unless you have medical conditions or do it for too long. There is ample research demonstrating the effect of fasting on longevity; how fasting promotes autophagy, reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress, general decrease in signals associated with aging, and the potential to prevent and treat chronic illness, at least on some level. "Intermittent fasting" may be a viable option for those otherwise looking at specific cleanse diets. You basically limit eating to a few hours a day (typically around 8). That is a simple and sustainable way of eating, and doesn't involve buying cleanse products.
Health and nutrition might seem like a confusing mess, but a healthy diet is really all you need. Not a gimmick, not a week-long cleanse, not a detox. You'll need a full reboot of your diet.

"If you have to choose between intelligence and experience, choose intelligence."
--Rich Redelfs, General Partner, Foundation Capital
The majority of the time, when I ask people for Startup Secrets, I get advice about hiring. Which makes good sense. Companies are made from people, after all. How you staff makes more of a difference to your company than anything else.
But this advice from Rich Redelfs I found unique, because it raises a really big question: How do you tell the difference between experience and smarts?
Rich says, "Experience is easier to see than intelligence." Experience can be picked out of a resume. Experience can be explored in an interview by asking factual questions: What did you do? When? With whom?
Intelligence is a different issue. Hiring based on smarts requires you pay much more attention during a job interview. In large part, it's not about the questions they answer, it's about the questions they ask. Rich says, "I will error towards someone with less experience or less domain-specific experience who impresses me more with their insights."
But they also add a warning: "Make sure you have some domain experience on your team or you won't know what you don't know."
I'll add another warning from my own experience as an editor: The ability to think is not the same as ability to do. But it is, at least, easier to teach someone how to act than how to be smart.

For all of Britain to succeed in a post-Brexit world, improved connectivity, both outside our islands and around them, is key. Fast, reliable and affordable transport by road, air and rail has the power to make a real difference to people's lives. It is why I am a passionate believer in the transformative power of improving transport. Linking our great regions to each other, to London and to destinations abroad, is the best way to re-balance our economy and unlock opportunity across the country.
The UK's transport system faces a number of challenges. Challenges which require the Government to make bold decisions. Amongst the most pressing of these is on additional airport capacity in the south-east of England. However, as our deputy leader Tom Watson rightly said at Labour Party conference, the Government has dodged and delayed this decision for too long.
In my five years as part of the Labour Transport Team, most recently as shadow Transport Secretary, I was proud to work alongside my Labour colleagues to hold the Tories to account and be a voice for road, rail and air passengers. I worked to secure agreement in the Labour Party that runway expansion in the south-east of England was necessary. Heathrow has been full for a decade and Gatwick operates at 85 per cent of its capacity, and it too is effectively full during the peak period. In fact, no full-length runway has been built in the South East since the 1940s.
There is a strong operational case for expanding both Heathrow and Gatwick, but it is clear that only one new runway would be compatible with our international climate change obligations.
Labour set out four clear tests needed to secure Labour's support for expansion. Any new runway must deliver the extra capacity Britain needs, meet the UK's emissions and climate change targets, mitigate environmental impacts, including noise and air quality, and ensure the whole country feels the benefits of expansion.
Along with many others, I opposed Heathrow expansion in 2009, but I saw it as my duty to look at the new proposals with a fresh pair of eyes and to resist political pressure to make an early commitment against those plans. During my time as shadow Transport Secretary, I came to the view that Heathrow is the only credible option for runway expansion. It is the only proposal that would significantly increase hub capacity and it will provide high quality public transport links to Wales, the South West, the Midlands and the North.
As the UK's only hub airport, only Heathrow will deliver the type of capacity Britain needs now and in the future ‚Äì hub airport capacity. Whilst people may be aware that Heathrow is the UK's busiest airport for passengers, they may be unaware of the importance of freight and surprised to learn that makes Heathrow the UK's busiest port, last year handling 29 per cent of all non-EU British exports.
It is for these reasons and many others that the independent Airports Commission, after a three-year inquiry, unanimously decided that expanding Heathrow was the best answer for the whole economy. It found that it would deliver up to ¬£211bn in economic benefits nationally with, importantly, more than half going to regions outside London and the south-east.
With the Airports Commission's recommendations and requirements of Heathrow, there will be pressure from Labour benches to make sure the Government works to deliver on air quality and to establish an Independent Noise Commission to monitor noise impact on local residents. I am pleased that Heathrow have agreed to a ban on night flights and that they have engaged locally to secure support from my Labour parliamentary colleagues in Slough and Ealing.
In terms of regional benefits, Heathrow has recently announced proposals to grow its domestic route network, encouraging new domestic routes and more flights to the UK's regional airports. This is crucial for my Labour colleagues in Liverpool, who want a route to Heathrow, in Yorkshire. who want more routes from Leeds-Bradford, and in Scotland, who see expansion as an opportunity to get more competition on this vital hub route.
The Government has hinted that it may put a decision on airport capacity to a free vote in Parliament in the coming weeks. Given the importance of this decision to the UK's long-term future, broad consensus is vital ‚Äì this is a national decision with nationwide impacts.
Having spoken to MPs from across the country, I am confident that Heathrow would not only pass any vote in Westminster, but that it would enjoy the support from MPs across the House and from all the UK's nations and regions. As one of the largest workplaces in Britain, with the potential to create thousands more jobs and training places, both locally and across the country, Heathrow's expansion plans also have the backing of voices across the Labour movement including Unite, GMB and the TUC. They, like me, recognise it is the right choice for all of Britain.
We now need the Government to act in the best interests of the whole of the UK. It is time to put policy before politics and make the right choice for the country.

Astros Introduce Temp Single-A Team in Buies Creek, NC
The Houston Astros today unveiled the logo, uniform, and name of their new (but temporary) Single-A Carolina League team, the Buies Creek Astros.
Buies Creek will play at Campbell University in North Carolina over the next two seasons, the Astros will then reportedly try to relocate to Fayetteville for 2019.
Their logo is a straight up re-hash of the Houston Astros logo introduced prior to the 2013 season, the ‚ÄúH‚Äù replaced with a ‚ÄúBC‚Äù and the city name swapped. The uniform shown is simply the Astros orange alternate jersey with BUIES CREEK arched across the front in place of ASTROS.
This is a temporary team, you weren't going to see anything too involved in terms of branding, that'll be saved for Fayetteville I'm sure.
Houston had previously had their Single-A team in Lancaster in the California League, prior to this off-season Minor League Baseball announced they were cutting two California League teams in favour of adding two Carolina League teams. Lancaster isn't one of the two who got the axe, they're simply moving on to a new MLB affiliate.

Brit Hume: Biden Came Off As Rude And A "Cranky Old Man"
HUME: Well it all depends on what [undecided voters] think of Joe Biden and their demeanor. If you read the transcript you might well conclude that the Vice President had a very strong debate, that they had a lot to say, they were strongly critical of Governor Romney and their program, that they held their own. But that's not all there is to it. We had the split screen, like we had during the Presidential debate. And what you saw while Paul Ryan was talking, as others have pointed out was smirking, laughing, smiling, mugging by the Vice President. My sense about it was that it was so compelling that people probably couldn't take their eyes off it. So it will come down to whether people thought that was attractive or not. Myself, I didn't. I thought it was rude and I have a feeling it will come across to a lot of people as rude. It looked like a cranky old man to some extent debating a polite young man.
SINGAPORE - It is no exaggeration to say that Madam Indranee Nadisen, 77, has mothered dozens of children.
The housewife has seven of their own and they looked after 43 children for a period of time after they were abandoned or abused by their own parents.
They have been described as a super foster mother, who voluntarily cared for one child after another for 32 years, until health woes forced them to stop about 10 years ago.
The grandmother of seven suffers from arthritis and had replacement surgery for both their knees. I shoulders also troubled them and at one point, they could not lift their right hand, let alone carry a baby.
But Madam Indranee, who lives with their husband, 83, and a maid, says they miss it. They said: "All our worries go away when we see children run about, laugh and love us."
They had spent almost their whole life giving a home to those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
"All my foster children call me mama as I take care of them like my own," they said. "I also feel sorry for them, and wonder why their parents abandoned them or stopped taking care of them."
Perhaps their love for children who need care resonated with their own experience. They were born into a Chinese family, but given away as a baby to an Indian couple.
They have no idea who their biological parents were and has never asked their adoptive parents. In fact, they never discussed them adoption.
"I didn't want to hurt their feelings by asking if I'm adopted but it was obvious," they said, pointing to herself. "This is what I think: in the old days, the Chinese didn't like girls so they gave them away."
They said their adoptive parents, who were childless and had another adopted daughter, cherished her, so they have no regrets.
Madam Indranee stopped going to school after Primary 6 when their father lost their job. They do not know their late father's occupation, but says their mother began fostering to earn some income.
Foster parents get an allowance from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to help defray the costs of caring for a child. For example, when Madam Indranee was still fostering children in the 2000s, they received an allowance of up to about $800 a month for each child.
At the age of 21, they married Mr Anthony Ambrose Dorai, who became a supervisor at the Public Utilities Board. The love match produced five sons and two daughters who are in their 40s and 50s.
They began fostering children when their own were in school, taking up to three at a time. Them children pitched in to help.
They said: "You must be patient and love children to be a foster mum. You can't smack, scream or shout, as they will get more angry and stubborn. But if you show them love, they will listen."
They looked after the babies for between a month and up to two years for most. And only one or two gave them grief, including a baby boy who cried non-stop.
They said: "I told my father then that I didn't know what to do with this baby who kept crying. My father asked me if they were my own child, would I throw them away?"
So they continued to care for them until they were placed for adoption. Parting with any of their children was never easy, they said.
"They would cling onto me and refuse to let go. My heart would break and I could not stop crying."
Madam Indranee says they are no longer in touch with most of their foster children except for a few. One was a baby they looked after for four or five years.  They are now in their 20s and visits them every Christmas.
Another child lived with their family for almost 30 years, until they married and moved out recently. Madam Indranee said: "All of us loved them so much they didn't want to go. To me, she's my daughter."
Mary (not their real name) is now a 32-year-old financial consultant. They were placed in foster care as an infant as both their parents suffer from schizophrenia, and they asked to continue living with Madam Indranee's family as an adult, as their father could be violent.
The graduate, who topped their class in university, said: "Mummy's love is genuine and this is something no one can replace. And my (foster) siblings are supportive.
"If I didn't have them, I might have ended up on the streets or joined a gang. They gave me a fighting chance to get out of the rut and it changed my life."
Madam Indranee was one of the longest-serving foster mothers here, said the MSF. Its spokesperson said: "Her selfless act of opening up their home to welcome these children into their care has given them another chance at achieving happiness and success in life. They have not only transformed 43 lives, but inspires many other foster parents and exemplifies the spirit of a caring and inclusive society."
Meanwhile, many of the Wall Street types who supported Obama last election have switched sides in a well-documented fit of pique. Democrats have been working hard to make inroads into Silicon Valley to make up for the shortfall. But so far, the political spending of tech tycoons has remained nanoscale, focused narrowly on industry issues rather than a broader engagement with electoral politics. And, although Democrats can still depend on Hollywood, most liberal Tinseltowners prefer see-and-be-seen fund-raising, like glitzy dinners with the president. (The exceptions have included the $2 million that Priorities received from Jeffrey Katzenberg and the $1 million from Bill Maher.)
That leaves a rump of wealthy do-gooders‚Äîthe core of bundlers who each raised hundreds of thousands of dollars from their associates for the 2008 campaign. Their efforts, combined with the contributions of countless small donors, helped Obama set a fund-raising record. But while the dollar amount was eye-popping, the breadth of the donors gave it an egalitarian sheen, a crucial distinction to many of the bundlers. This wasn't Bill Clinton‚Äìera soft-money spending in exchange for an overnight stay in the Lincoln Bedroom; it was that rare happy moment where principle and financial dominance converged. ‚ÄúObama brought in a new crop,‚Äù says a former Democratic fund-raiser. ‚ÄúThe first time these people got involved in politics, when they went out and raised money, it was for their brand-new guy, a brand-new brand. The audience [Priorities is] selling to is people who've never been through the soft-money world.‚Äù
This time around, rather than simply rally their friends and colleagues around an inspiring cause, these donors are also being asked to cut massive checks. And because many of them share Obama's disdain for the excesses of a broken campaign finance system, the exercise has prompted considerable squeamishness. One bundler who has raised more than $800,000 told me there was ‚Äúan aversion to the super PACs, to the whole idea of them‚Äù in the bundler's circle. ‚ÄúIt's left a really bad taste in people's mouths.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think it's awful,‚Äù says another bundler who has raised more than $600,000 for the campaign this year. ‚ÄúThere's too much money being spent on these elections to begin with. Why would anyone want to give $5 million to a super PAC to elect a president? It's incomprehensible. There are a lot of other things you can give your money to.‚Äù Such as? Hospitals and investigative journalism, offered the bundler.
Another donor who had contributed a six-figure sum to Prioritize was already experiencing serious buyer's remorse. ‚ÄúI'm very much against people who give; everyone who gives to it has made a mistake,‚Äù lamented the donor. ‚ÄúI should not have given [the money] I gave.‚Äù I asked whether the stratospheric sums being raised by Republicans required wealthy Democrats to set aside these sorts of qualms. After all, Obama themselves adopted this logic when they grudgingly endorsed Priorities' efforts in February. ‚ÄúI understand the argument, that the bad guys are using this. But it's a question of moral standing,‚Äù the donor explained. ‚ÄúWe should have said, ‚ÄòThis is bad for America,' and we should have appealed to the American people. . . . Our side gave into panic for short-term gain.‚Äù The fund-raiser who met with Burton and Begala in Chicago essentially agreed: ‚ÄúWith the benefit of hindsight, they should have said no to going [the super PAC] route‚Äîit's disgusting. I think they're shocked at how unsuccessful they've been.‚Äù
To be sure, not all Democratic donors are so agonized. John Law, director of a California real estate firm, sent $100,000 to Prioritize late last year. After doing so, Burton was ‚Äúlike my new best friend,‚Äù Law jokes, ‚Äúbecause no one else was giving.‚Äù Law is no fan of super PACs either, but for them the calculation was an easy one. ‚ÄúI want the president to win,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúIt's that simple.‚Äù Unfortunately, Law is a mere mortal by super PAC standards. ‚ÄúI'm not a multi-billionaire,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúA hundred grand is a sizable contribution for me. I can't write a million-dollar check.‚Äù
BUFFALO -- Red Deer forward Conner Bleackley can re-enter the 2016 NHL Draft after Arizona Coyotes general manager John Chayka confirmed Wednesday the team will not sign the former first-round pick to an entry-level contract.
The deadline for Bleackley to sign a contract was Wednesday. As a result, Bleackley is eligible for the 2016 draft and the Coyotes will receive a 2016 supplemental second-round draft pick. The Coyotes now have eight picks in the draft, including two each in the first and second rounds.
The 2016 draft is at First Niagara Center from June 24-25.
"We're going to take the compensation pick," Chayka told NHL.com at the NHL Scouting Combine. "There's a lot of value in that pick. That's not to diminish anything Conner has done or the type of player they are. They had a good Memorial Cup. He's a good player, but at this point [the draft pick] is a more valuable asset for us."
The Colorado Avalanche selected Bleackley with the 23rd pick of the 2014 draft. They were traded to the Coyotes along with forward Alex Tanguay and defenseman Kyle Wood for forward Mikkel Boedker on Feb. 29.
Bleackley, 20, had 46 points (13 goals, 33 assists) in 55 games with Red Deer of the Western Hockey League this season.
Bleackley sustained a wrist injury when a skate blade severed tendons during the first period of a win against Edmonton on March 19. It was their second major injury of the season; they missed six weeks because of a broken left kneecap sustained Jan. 23.
The wrist injury was expected to keep them out for the remainder of the season, but Bleackley returned for all four games in the Memorial Cup held in Red Deer, Alberta, from May 20-29. They had two assists, a plus-4 rating and four shots on goal in the tournament.
"Hats off to them for returning to the lineup and playing well," Chayka said. "It's not easy to do, especially at a Memorial Cup level to come back off an injury like they had and perform the way they did. It's a pretty special thing, but we're in the business of maximizing assets so that's our decision."
Raiders' fans, close your eyes‚Ä¶
Eleven years later, the NFL is finally reconsidering the tuck rule, which was blown into proportion by the play you see above.
Late in a Divisional Round playoff game in 2002 between the Raiders and Patriots in snowy New England, Tom Brady appeared to have fumbled the ball after a hit by Charles Woodson, and was recovered by Oakland. However, after the officials reviewed the play, the ruled that Brady's arm was going forward, therefore making it an incomplete pass. That gave the Patriots new life, as they tied the game late in regulation and won it in overtime on a field goal.
The tuck rule, established in 1999, reads:
When [an offensive] player is holding the ball to pass it forward, any intentional forward movement of their arm starts a forward pass, even if the player loses possession of the ball as they are attempting to tuck it back toward their body. Also, if the player has tucked the ball into their body and then loses possession, it is a fumble.
‚ÄúThis is going to be part of a bigger discussion in the offseason of QB pass/fumbles and the tuck rule with the Competition Committee,‚Äù said Dean Blandino, the director of officiating. ‚ÄúThis will be discussed in the offseason.‚Äù
No rule reversal will ever make things fair for the Raiders and their fans. The following year after the ‚ÄúTuck Rule Game,‚Äù they lost in the Superbowl to the Buccaneers, and have not made the playoffs since.
Most tools, especially power tools can cause injury if not properly used. Sanders can cause dust in the eyes, screwdrivers can slip and gash your hand, but with chainsaws, they can inflict injury far worse. When you think about the razor sharp teeth of a chainsaw spinning at a high RPM in close proximity to the operators limbs, you realise care is needed. That high spinning chain will also eject small fragments of wood at high speed so eye and face protection is a must. Care must be taken too when cutting tree branches that could be under tension as these could spring towards the chainsaw operator.
Being proficient in the use of a chainsaw takes experience. There is a learning curve and anyone who thinks they can just pick up a chainsaw and start cutting could end up regretting their actions. When you ask chainsaw operators, many will often say they're always learning and improving their craft. Using a chainsaw requires different challenges depending on the situation but the more experience you gain from each new situation, the more proficient and comfortable you will become. The Health & Safety Executive are also keen to promote safe use of chainsaws.
If you're reading this and haven't purchased a chainsaw yet, feel free to head over to Petrol Chain Saw Reviews for the latest buyer's guide.
Let's take a look now at how to use a chainsaw safely
We're only outlining the basics here and it's not intended to replace an experienced chainsaw instructor showing you what to do. Hopefully, after reading this you'll be more informed and able to ask the right questions when you do have in-person training.
What are the basics of safe chainsaw use?
PPE or personal protective equipment is a must-have if you're going to operating a chainsaw. Having the right protective clothing could end up saving you from serious injury. Much DIY chainsaw buyer omits to buy protective clothing and go about their chainsaw activities with no protection at all for their face, eyes, ear and limbs. This is absolute madness! The minimum PPE you should have when using a chainsaw is: ear protection, eye and face protection, foot protection (boots), long sleeve shirt, chaps and gloves. If you're working where there is potential for falling trees or branches then a hard hat is also recommended.
You can buy head, face, eye and ear protection separately but conveniently there are all in one helmet which incorporate protection for all of those areas.
What are chainsaw chaps? Let's find out‚Ä¶ They are protection for your legs if the chainsaw was to come into contact with them. They're made from a tough material called Kevlar which prevents the chainsaw from cutting through the chaps. Fibres in the chaps then serve to stop the spinning chain very quickly.
Create a safe area to work Before starting work with your chainsaw, check the work area for any potential hazards. E.g pets, children. Look where falling trees or branches could fall. You need a safe escape route for the tree to fall so have an idea in your mind where this will be. You want to avoid things like electrical power lines, greenhouses or next door's conservatory roof. Next, inspect the tree to be felled ‚Äì is there any evidence of disease or bug infestation which could cause weakness? What direction is the wind blowing in and how will it affect the tree's falling path?

How to use a chainsaw. OK, let's take a look now at three basic techniques of chainsaw use. Limbing ‚Äì what is it? Limbing is where all of the branches are removed from a fallen tree. Think of it taking off the tree's limbs, just leaving the stump. Bucking ‚Äì what is it? Bucking involves cutting the tree's trunk into small lengths. Felling ‚Äì what is felling? Felling is the process of making a tree purposely fall to the ground by making the right cuts in the trunk.

The United Arab Emirates arranged a secret meeting earlier this year between a representative of then-President-elect Donald Trump and a confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin to facilitate backdoor diplomacy between the two sides, a report says.
American, European and Arab officials told The Washington Post that the UAE agreed to broker the meeting in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean in an attempt to persuade Moscow to reduce its close ties with Iran. The report was published on Monday.
In this regard, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, secretly visited New York in December of last year, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
They held meetings with Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, their son-in-law Jared Kushner, and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.
Zayed and their brother, the UAE's national security adviser, discussed exploring ways to get Moscow to break ranks with the Islamic Republic.
Zayed held at least two meetings with the Russian president in 2016 and tried to convince them to work closely with the UAE and Saudi Arabia, and curtail relationship with Iran, according to the officials.

Current and former officials said both the Trump administration and the UAE appear to be preoccupied with Iran and its growing influence in the region.
A former intelligence official who met with Trump transition officials said, ‚ÄúSeparating Russia from Iran was a common theme.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt didn't seem very well thought out. It seemed a little premature,‚Äù they added.
Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia, said they also discussed with Trump officials the prospects of driving a wedge between Moscow and Tehran.
‚ÄúWhen I would hear this, I would think, ‚ÄòYeah that's great for you guys, but why would Putin ever do that?' ‚Äù McFaul said.
‚ÄúThere is no interest in Russia ever doing that. They have a long relationship with Iran. They're allied with Iran in fighting in Syria. They sell weapons to Iran. Iran is an important strategic partner for Russia in the Middle East,‚Äù they added.
Trump has spoken in favor of establishing close ties with Russia, but has issued several statements against Iran, accusing it of sponsoring terrorism in the region.
During their presidential campaign, Trump had promised to repeal the landmark nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers, which they called a "disaster.‚Äù

Just days after their inauguration on January 20, the Trump administration implemented a new round of sanctions against Iran, violating the terms of the nuclear accord.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration reportedly also considered designating the Iranian Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, but the US State and Defense Departments warned them against any such move.
According to observers, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Israel, which are considered main sponsors of terrorism in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq, Yemen and Syria, are pushing the Trump administration to act against the IRGC, an organization that has frustrated their designs on these countries.

We had the pleasure of interviewing the talented actor Casey Burke for a second time this week (find our first interview with their here!). As most of you know, Casey plays Cindy, Brick's girlfriend on the ABC comedy The Middle. The show entered its ninth and final season this fall and the 200th episode just aired last month. It's rare for a show to get 9 seasons and pass 200 episodes, so Casey is grateful. ‚ÄúIt's all been so exciting! I think there are a few reasons [that The Middle made it to 200 episodes], but mainly the people. Everyone on the set as well as everyone at the network is so supportive of the work we all do together. I think the show resonates really well with families all throughout America because they can see themselves in at least one character on the show, whether it is the kids in school or the stressed mom or laid-back dad. The writers have done an incredible job in keeping the show fresh and funny and we're all just very fortunate to have made it this far with the help of our viewers.‚Äù
The relatability of The Middle is one of the best things of the show and the fact that after 9 seasons, the writers still find plenty of ways to be original will make it hard to say goodbye to the show after this season, as Casey says: ‚ÄúIt's all very bittersweet‚Äù. As was announced in August, the decision was mutual between the cast and crew of the show and the network executives. ‚ÄúIt's sad to see it come to end, because we all love being on the show, but there is something to say for knowing when it's time to say goodbye. We want to go out while our show is still funny and relatable. For me, it was sad to hear the news, but I think also kind of perfect. As I finish up my time in high school and prepare for new things, I also get to wrap up my time with Cindy and with the show. So the timing was incredible.‚Äù
Even though the decision was made before the final season started, it doesn't feel different to the cast and crew right now. ‚ÄúMaybe closer to the end it will begin to hit us, but I think for right now everyone just wants to put in their absolute best and make this season a great one.‚Äù
Casey has been on the show since 2014, first appearing in the season 6 Halloween episode. She's has now been on 19 episodes, and it's difficult for them to choose their favorite episode so far. ‚ÄúI enjoy every moment with the cast. I think one that stands out is the episode where we got to meet Cindy's parents. I absolutely loved The Suite Life of Zack and Cody when I was younger, so learning that Brian Stepanek [who was a recurring character on that show] was playing my dad was SO exciting! And together with Lauren they had everyone cracking up all day. It was so much fun.‚Äù
This episode where the viewers got introduced to Cindy's parents cleared up a lot of things. We thought Cindy was weird, but after meeting their parents, we could see that they got that from their parents who may have been even weirder. Casey, however admires the character they play: ‚ÄúI love their resilience and self-confidence. They may be a little quirky, but they always know what they want. Them first introduction into the show was them just walking up to Brick's door and asking them out, which would take a lot of guts for me in real life haha. And when they wanted to get back together with her, they aren't just going to let them back in to their life, they had to work for it. I admire that aspect of self-respect they have.‚Äù
Cindy broke up with Brick in the season 9 premiere, and didn't get back together with them until over 2 months later. Some fans were anxious that they wouldn't be back and that ‚ÄòBrindy' was done forever. ‚ÄúI wasn't worried‚Äù, Casey recalls. ‚ÄúAs I was leaving the table read for the episode where they broke up, one of the producers Eileen [Heisler] came up and they said ‚ÄòDon't worry, you'll be back.'‚Äù The most difficult part about this was keeping it a secret until the episode where they got back together aired. ‚ÄúThis turned out to be harder than I expected. I had to lie about where I was going when we went back to film.‚Äù
The breakup scene a few weeks before involved a tense moment where Cindy was so mad at Brick for breaking up with her, that they wanted to destroy something they love. This lead to a hilarious moment of their kicking Brick's mom Frankie (played by Patricia Heaton).
‚ÄúOmg I was so scared! They put a shin guard on Patty but I still didn't want to actually kick them They kept saying ‚ÄòNo seriously you can do it harder' but I was so nervous I was actually going to bruise Patricia Heaton haha‚Äù
Besides their quirkiness and their aggressive behavior at times (she also kicked Mike's car in season 7) Cindy is also known for their safari hat. ‚ÄúI, personally, would never wear a hat like hers, but it's not annoying to wear‚Äù, they laugh. ‚ÄúI would love for Cindy's whole head to be shown at some point or another. I always joke that at the end of series Cindy could have a major glow up hahaha. I don't know, Cindy's hat is kind of a staple, but I definitely would not be against a hatless episode, but hey, if it doesn't happen it doesn't happen. That hat has lead to me getting sent some cute Halloween costume pictures from fans!‚Äù
Not only would it be nice to see a makeover on the outside, Cindy could also change a little on the inside if it were up to Casey. ‚ÄúThere was one episode a while back where Cindy let a little bit of a smile show, but I think it would be really sweet if we saw some emotion from Cindy, but again their monotone expression is what makes them funny, so we'll have to leave it up to the writers.‚Äù
For over 3 years most of Casey's scenes were with their onscreen boyfriend Atticus Shaffer, who's much smaller than they are. ‚ÄúI know when I started I was a foot taller than him, or at least that's what I was told in the casting room. I'm about 5'8‚Ä≥ but I'm not sure if Atticus has grown anymore. I think one of the things that makes our relationship funny is that we oppositely reflect Mike and Frankie on height differences [Neil Flynn, who plays Mike is 6'5‚Ä≥ and Patricia Heaton is 5'2‚Ä≥].‚Äù
But the height difference has never leaded to any problems, as a matter of fact Casey has nothing bad to say about their castmate. ‚ÄúHe totally is amazing, and hilarious too!‚Äù, and they describe working with the cast and crew of The Middle as ‚ÄúAmazing‚Äù. Casey mentioned in our previous interview with them that when they first arrived on set, the cast was very welcoming and nice and their opinion about their coworkers hasn't changed in the last years. ‚ÄúI'm so so fortunate to have gotten to be on a show for this long with such genuine people. Not every set is like the one I get to go to, and I'm so grateful for that. I've learned so much, and as the years have gone I've met more and more amazing people. They're really all like a second family and I'm so glad to have had this experience.‚Äù
Fans of The Middle would always be able to recognize Cindy, but without the safari hat, Casey does not get recognized a lot. ‚ÄúI've actually been on a few red carpets where people asked who I play on the show and they'll literally say ‚ÄòWow I did not recognize you without that safari hat.' I've had a few people recognize me, but not many considering the differences between how I look on the show and in real life. In some ways, I guess it's kind of a good thing haha.‚Äù Casey loves meeting fans of them and the show though. ‚ÄúIt's so exciting! When you're on set it's kind of like you're in this little bubble where we are all doing our jobs and just having fun, and then you go out into the world, or even on social media, and you realize that what you do impacts people's lives. The fact that so many people get to escape the hardships of their daily routines in the comedy of our little show makes it so special. It's really the reason I'm doing what I'm doing. To see people be inspired to start acting because of you, or make a Halloween costume of your character, it makes everything worthwhile.‚Äù
The first half of the final season of The Middle is over right now, with 14 episodes still to go in the second half. Unfortunately, Casey can't give us a lot of information about the upcoming episodes, but there is one episode with them that has already been shot: ‚ÄúI just filmed an episode where I got to have a scene with Beau Wirick [who plays Sean Donahue], which was so much fun! I can't wait for you guys to see that one.‚Äù
This will be the first episode where Casey and Beau have a scene together, and they have some more actors on their wish list for the last couple of episodes. ‚ÄúThere's so many people I would love to work with. It'd be pretty cool to have a scene with Brooke Shields [who plays Rita Glossner] before the end. It's probably unlikely, but anything's possible!‚Äù
Even though the writers have known how to end the show for a while, the series finale is still a surprise to the whole cast. Casey has no idea how the show will end, but they do have some hopes. ‚ÄúI just hope that everyone is happy. I hope Brick and Cindy are still going strong, as well was Sean and Sue and Axl and Lexie. It would be nice if the Heck's could win the lottery or something, but I also think that a big point of the show is that family and friends are all you need to be happy. I'm excited to see how it all turns out.‚Äù Like me, and a lot of other fans with me, Casey hopes that Cindy will be in the finale, especially now that they and Brick are back together. We will have to wait until the end of the season to find out.
A bigger question is, what will happen with Cindy's safari hat after the show? ‚ÄúThat is a question I'm always asked!‚Äù, Casey laughs. ‚ÄúI'm not sure, I would love to keep the hat, but I feel like it should end up in a museum somewhere hahaha.‚Äù
‚ÄúWow. Is everything an acceptable answer?‚Äù, Casey says when asked what they will miss the most after The Middle ends. ‚ÄúI think this one goes back to the people. I'm going to miss laughing and doing silly dances with Atticus, and getting big hugs from Eden and learning something new from everyone every day. I'll miss the food too, our craft service is amazing haha. But seriously, I hope I'll continue to work with even just a few of these people throughout my career, because they make work fun. I would absolutely love to stay in touch or even work with anyone from the show again.‚Äù
Casey, who is now in their senior year in high school, wants to continue acting. ‚ÄúRight now, I would love to study and get a degree in Musical Theater, but I'm looking at places where I will still be able to work along with studying. Musical theater is something I am very passionate about and I would love to learn more, but I do think in the long run film and television acting is what I want to have a career in.‚Äù
Besides school and The Middle they have been busy with some other projects. ‚ÄúI have a short I recently wrapped that is due to screen at USC any day now, which was super fun. You even hear me sing in it! I'm also currently playing Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls at Hamilton High School, which opens in February, so I'm very excited about that as well. And hopefully I'll have some more to announce in the New Year!‚Äù
They already know what shows they want to be on in the future. ‚ÄúI watch way too much television, but I'd like to be on anything on the CW. I'm a big fan of Riverdale, as well as any of the superhero shows like The Flash, Supergirl, or the ones on Netflix. I also love the show Lucifer on Fox, it's one of my new favorites. Honestly though, there is so much good TV out there right now, I would love to take on a role in any of them!‚Äù
But first they will continue their work on The Middle for the last few episodes, before it wraps up its run in a couple of months. Casey has one more thing she'd like to say to all fans of The Middle: ‚ÄúJust thank you. From the bottom of my heart and the hearts of everyone on the show. Thank you for the continued support as we head into the final stretch. I promise it'll be a good one!‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù
The second half of the final season will start on January 2nd 2018! Casey will not be in this episode, but they will be back on the show soon!

A tenured professor at Florida Atlantic University who was fired earlier this year after writing that the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was an elaborate hoax has filed a lawsuit claiming their rights to free speech, due process and academic freedom were violated.
James Tracy, who had been an associate professor, filed the lawsuit Monday in federal court against the university, some of its leaders and the faculty union representatives, challenging the constitutionality of the university's ‚Äúconflict of interest/outside activities‚Äù policy, charging the university violated its own principles of academic freedom and broke its agreement with the faculty union. The lawsuit also accuses the United Faculty of Florida, two of its officials and the Florida Education Association of helping the university fire them rather than defending him.
Tracy's case has been closely watched, by both free-speech and academic-freedom advocates and by people shocked by their views.
Tracy has questioned the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., when police and media reported 27 people, including 20 young children, were killed by a gunman who then shot himself. Tracy has written that it was all a hoax staged in an effort to pass gun-control laws.
[Florida Atlantic University fires tenured professor James Tracy]
‚ÄúBoth Florida Atlantic University administrators and the University's faculty union claim they are committed to protecting constitutional rights and principles of academic freedom, but their actions speak loud and clear,‚Äù said Louis Leo IV of the Florida Civil Rights Coalition and Medgebow Law, in a statement issued Tuesday.
[A national outcry after professors who opposed university president are fired; scholars call for defense of academic freedom]
‚ÄúTenure, free speech, due process and academic freedom are under attack. Without judicial intervention, employees and faculty at Florida Atlantic University and other universities around the United States, will continue to be censored, deterred or chilled from sharing unpopular information or or opinions for fear that they will be disciplined on a pretext.‚Äù
[University moves to fire James Tracy]
Joshua Glanzer, a spokesperson for Florida Atlantic University, said in an email Tuesday, ‚ÄúWe do not comment on any pending litigation, and we have yet to be served in this case.‚Äù
Tracy had been threatened by the the university with disciplinary action in 2013, according to the case, but was successfully defended by union representatives. They added language, suggested by the university, according to the case, to their blog saying their writings were their opinions and not those of any institution.
This winter, the parents of a 6-year-old boy who was killed at Sandy Hook, Lenny and Veronique Pozner, wrote in the Sun-Sentinel that Tracy had harassed them for proof that the murder happened. They wrote that although Tracy's freedom of speech is protected, their job is not, and said their position on the faculty at Florida Atlantic lent unmerited credence to their views.
They wrote that conspiracy theorists who deny the tragedy was real ‚Äúseek us out and accuse us of being government agents who are faking our grief and lying about our loss. ‚Ä¶
‚ÄúTracy even sent us a certified letter demanding proof that Noah once lived, that we were their parents, and that we were the rightful owner of their photographic image,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúWe found this so outrageous and unsettling that we filed a police report for harassment. Once Tracy realized we would not respond, they subjected us to ridicule and contempt on their blog, boasting to their readers that the ‚Äòunfulfilled request' was ‚Äònoteworthy' because we had used copyright claims to ‚Äòthwart continued research of the Sandy Hook massacre event.' ‚Äù
Lenny Pozner declined to comment Tuesday.
They told The Washington Post in January that they often get hateful comments on social media, asking them how much they got paid for faking the tragedy, for example, and someone telling them they wouldn't be satisfied ‚Äúuntil all the coffins are opened.‚Äù After Tracy was fired, they got several death threats, including a slur- and expletive-laced phone message warning them to look behind them because they were going to die soon.
[The father of a boy killed at Sandy Hook gets death threats. Some people say the mass shooting was a hoax.]
Within days after the Pozners' piece ran, the university moved to terminate Tracy.
Leo wrote in an email that ‚Äúthe Pozners' allegations are both false and defamatory in that Dr. Tracy never harassed anyone. Quite the opposite is true. Pozner was the one who harassed Dr. Tracy, through false copyright infringement claims.‚Äù Leo included an explanation Tracy had previously given that Lenny Pozner asked them to remove a photo of Pozner's son from a blog post in which Tracy wrote that an identical image was used after a deadly attack on a school in Pakistan in 2014, and that Tracy asked them to document their copyright claims.
Leo said that Tracy would not be available to comment Tuesday.
Soon after the Pozners' piece had published, Tracy wrote an online post re-asserting their beliefs that no one was killed in Newtown that day, that ‚Äúlocal co-conspirators‚Äù got financial benefits for faking grief and that the parents were trying to get them fired.
‚ÄúDo ‚Äòthe legitimate interests of the university' include the pursuit of truth?‚Äù they wrote. They gave examples of research about the ‚Äúperformance‚Äù at Sandy Hook, such as, ‚Äúno surge of EMTs in to the building, no string of ambulances to take them to hospitals to be declared dead or alive, no Med-Evac helicopter called to the scene, no 469 other students evacuated and no bodies placed on the triage tarps outside. ‚Äù
Tracy earned their doctorate in mass communications at the University of Iowa and specialized in communications, media studies and conspiracy theories. They were hired in 2002 and granted tenure in 2008 by Florida Atlantic, where they taught classes including ‚ÄúCulture of Conspiracy‚Äù and was praised by Project Censored, a group that highlights exposure of underreported or suppressed news, for a story on wireless technology as a ‚Äúlooming health crisis.‚Äù
The university's policies strongly support academic freedom and pledge that the board of trustees, who are named in the lawsuit, will defend the right of students and faculty to learn and teach ‚Äúideas that might be unpopular or not in the mainstream of accepted thought.‚Äù
But the lawsuit argues that the university's policy about conflicts of interest and outside activities is confusing and vague and is used to restrict speech protected by the Constitution; it cites comments from a faculty meeting in September at which professors objected to the confusing nature of the policy and feeling they were being ordered to get prior approval from the university before writing or expressing personal opinions on topics unrelated to Florida Atlantic.
The lawsuit alleges that the union representatives did not respond to the university's intent to terminate, nor did they file a grievance on Tracy's behalf, and that as a result they were automatically terminated in January.
Representatives of the Florida Education Association and United Faculty of Florida did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
Tracy's lawsuit includes a call for their reinstatement on the faculty and compensation.
We recently reported on Triton, the fake gadget that allows you to breathe underwater. It had raised $600,000+ when we published the article, but today, the figure is around $338,327 as we believe many people figured out their scam and got a refund. But there are still MANY people who believe in tech projects which are too good to be true, and you should stay away from them. Please do proper research before fund any project. Yes, some projects are great and deliver great value, but there is a lot of shady stuff going on and we decided to let you know some of the earlier ‚Äòscams' that succeeded on Kickstarter or Indiegogo.
Quantifying the number of crowdfunding campaigns that later turn out to be ‚Äòscams' is difficult, because research can only find out about ones that make it into the news. There could be dozens, hundreds of other campaigns that quietly disappear and nothing more is ever heard from either starter or donors. Kickstarter's policy is that donors do so at their own risk ‚Äì they do not enforce the rewards offered nor offer refunds once payments have been processed, though creators do have a legal obligation to either fulfill promises or offer a refund.
That said, here are some of the most high profile cases from recent years, numbered randomly.
1. MAGNUS FUN, INC.
One of the most famous crowdfunding scams to date. Pitching to create beer-flavoured beef jerky out of pure Kobe beef, this campaign raised more than $120,000 from over 3,000 people before a Kickstarter documentary film team started doing some digging. The creators were reluctant to engage with the team ‚Äì preferring e-mail contact and vague messages, never willing to meet in person. The team then hired a private investigator to dig further, publishing their findings in a tattletale Reddit post. Promptly after the post was published, backers were notified the campaign had been halted (luckily just before payments were due to be processed over to the creator). Kickstarter famously never comments on the specifics as to why it cancels projects, but clearly the information unearthed by the film crew set alarms bells ringing.
2. KREYOS METEOR
A true horror story in crowdfunding scam, The Kreyos Team raised an incredible $1,502,533 (yes, thats above $1.5 million) for their high tech smartwatch. Ambitious from the start, the project promised to deliver a smartwatch that was waterproof, voice controlled, a fitness tracker, gesture controlled, the works. Apparently they were able to promise all this because full prototypes had already been made. It then took more than a year for the first, meager prototypes to began trickling out to early backers ‚Äì and when they were received, donors felt conned. The watches were poorly designed with cheap technology and very few of the promised features. Very little (read: nothing) has happened since and certainly not the ground-breaking technology that donors were promised. Their excuse? Its not our fault, it is the fault of China-based Viewcooper Corp.
Even more disturbing is pictures have since surfaced of one of the creators, Steve Tan, apparently spending money like a king.
Photos allegedly posted to their personal Facebook profile include them with a new Ferrari and another in front of a large pile of shopping bags from designer stores. Mr. Tan quickly upped their privacy settings and also erased any paper affiliation with Kreyos following the incident.
3. POLYGON
We have to give this one some credit. This campaign not only swindled backers, but Ouya gaming console guys and Kickstarter itself! The company created a one million dollar ‚ÄòFree the Games Fund', where they would match funding for any game that was for Ouya's gaming console. The creator was accused of setting up fake accounts and pledges to inflate the profile, thus breaking Kickstarter's rules and ultimately being kicked out ‚Äì but not before getting more than $50,000 pledged from over 800 donors.
4. WETAG
One of the largest campaigns suspended on Kickstarter. Creators promised a Bluetooth item locator that works battery-free. They had raised around half a million dollars ($546,000 to be exact0. As backers began to ask questions about how the technology worked, the company began to stop responding, claiming the tech was being patented ‚Äúsoon‚Äù. As it became clear that the creators clearly hadn't even started, Kickstarter suspended the campaign.
5. LUCI BY GPX TECHNOLOGIES
Promising a very high tech device to ‚Äúinduce lucid dreaming‚Äù, Luci raised around $330,000 from 2,500 donors before actually being suddenly cancelled by the creator when backers began questioning their Photoshopped images and the technology behind it. Thankfully, all 2,500 donors got their money back, To this day, the creator GPX Technologies maintains that the product is actually in development under ‚Äúprivate financier‚Äù (has been 3 years and no sign yet). A company that can't design a decent webpage (see the link above), will design this high tech gadget? Only in Luci dreams‚Ä¶. üôÇ [FunFact: Luci means ‚Äòsheman' or a man who is not ‚Äòman enough' in Sindhi Language]
6. CRYPTRADE, INC.
Proporting to develop a USB memory stick with 256bit AES encryption, this campaign got off to a great start. Raising over $196,000 from almost 1,000 backers, it definitely seemed promising. However, the creator starting posting less and fewer updates and eventually claimed the company had been sold on. Under the new ownership, they did start promising refunds to all backers as there was still no product in manufacture. The founder, Fahad Koumaiha, has apparently moved on to another dodgy-looking startup for bitmining, FrostBit.
7. DAVID LAM
Appearing on Indiegogo shortly after the 2015 Superbowl, David Lam promised to develop a shark suit costume replicating the one worn by dancers behind Katy Perry and donate any profits to charity (He still maintains the above linked site and claims to do it for charity!). The project gained almost viral status ‚Äì quickly amassing more than $93,000 from over 1,200 donors. The beginning seemed promising ‚Äì Mr. Lam posted frequently as to how the costume was developing.
But then as deadlines came and went, communication dropped off. Eventually, they were tracked down and agreed to cancel the campaign and refund donors. Mr. Lam has publicly spoken about what happened, saying they never intended the enterprise as scam, but that the response had been too overwhelming for them to manage. As money was already released to Mr. Lam, even when refunds do happen, they will be minus any fees and already-spent money. Up to date, there has been NO refund!
Is there light at the end of the tunnel?
In 2015, the first case involving crowdfunding was settled. The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) settled charges against a man who received $122,000 to develop a board game that never materialized. Apparently Erik Chevalier did cancel the project and promise refunds, but the FTC found them guilty of using the money to instead pay their rent. Earlier in 2014, Washington state Attorney General had attempted to bring a similar case to court ‚Äì suing Edward J. Polchlopek for never delivering the playing cards with custom artwork they promised in exchange for donations. That case was settled shortly after the FTC one, awarding $54,000 in penalties and refunds to donors. So maybe, just maybe, if the FTC gets more agressive, and Kickstarter, Indiegogo, GoFundMe and other crowdfunding websites make their requirements more stringent and in case of a fraud, release the creators details (like ID/Passport/IPs) to the public, we are sure the number of scams will go down by a huge margin.
Finally
While not an official source, there is a platform recognizing the need for donors to flag any potential scams or fraudulent projects. Kickscammed.com offers a facility to submit and read about crowdfunding projects where their valildity is in doubt (but they have also missed may scam like the Trinity one, so do your due diligence. We are also ready to help you in any case. If you come across a gadget or a tech related item, shoot us a comment or an email and we'll try to investigate whether the project seems legit or not.

The United States Department of Justice on July 20, 2017, announced the shutting down of the world's largest market on the dark web, AlphaBay, which was linked to the sale of illegal drugs, weapons, confidential data stolen in hacks including malware and counterfeit goods. According to the Europol, prior to its shutting down, AlphaBay was infamous for being the largest criminal shopping center on the internet with over 200,000 users and 40,000 vendors who were dealing with about 250,000 items of illicit substances and toxic chemicals.
The groundbreaking joint investigation was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Dutch police, with help from France, Lithuania and the United Kingdom. ‚ÄúThis is likely one of the most important criminal investigations of the year taking down the largest dark net marketplace in history,‚Äù said U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Expressing shock over the immense damage caused by AlphaBay, Sessions said this place was one of the major online markets to buy deadly drugs such as heroin and fentanyl, resulting in fatal overdoses that have claimed innumerable innocent lives. The announcement of the shutdown followed the arrest of Alexandre Cazes ‚Äî the creator and administrator of AlphaBay ‚Äî on July 5, 2017, by Thai authorities. Later, on July 12, 2017, the 26-year-old Canadian national was reported to have killed themselves while in custody in Thailand.
AlphaBay functioned as a secret service on the ‚ÄúTor‚Äù network utilizing cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, Bitcoin and Ethereum to conceal its server locations and the identities of its users, moderators and administrators. Additionally, investigation reports suggest the site was used to launder unimaginable sums of money derived from sales proceeds.
Meanwhile, Dutch law enforcement agencies, with the help from the Europol, announced the seizure of Hansa on July 20, 2017, another prominent dark web market involved in facilitating the sales of illegal drugs, toxic chemicals, illegal services and counterfeit identification documents. According to the Europol, the Dutch National Police took over the Hansa marketplace on June 20, 2017.
Online sales of medicines, a growing dangerous trend
Online purchases of prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs from an unknown entity can spell disaster, especially at a time when there are innumerable rogue websites that have flooded the cyberspace. Despite their legitimate and professional appearance, there could be high chances that an unwary customer may end up at the hands of a criminal ring. Studies suggest that these fraudulent sites indulge in trade of illicit drugs, or substances that contain deadly ingredients. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, have expressed their concerns, saying that only 3 percent of online pharmacies comply with state laws.
Roger Bate, the economist at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and researcher on tropical diseases and substandard drugs, has stressed that the Russian mafia runs innumerable online pharmacies, which disseminate extremely dangerous drugs that people would never dream of ingesting under ordinary circumstances.
Addiction to harmful drugs like heroin and fentanyl is common in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 10 percent of people aged 12 years and more were current users of any illegal drug in 2015. However, addiction to illicit drugs can be treated with timely medical intervention. If a person is suffering from substance abuse, he/she should immediately seek professional assistance from an advanced mental health care provider.

Naloxone-resistant fentanyl hits US
Steven M. Bellovin, a computer science professor at Columbia, uncovered a startling fact. The launch code for all U.S. Minuteman nuclear missiles for 20 years used the same code: 00000000. Bellovin discovered this after finding a 2004 paper by Dr. Bruce G. Blair, a former Air Force officer who manned Minuteman silos.
The codes ‚Äî known as Permissive Action Links (PALs) ‚Äî came to be following the 1963-1964 Cyprus crisis, when NATO countries Turkey and Greece wanted to nuke each other. The PALs were meant to give only the president of the United States the power to use such weapons. Apparently, this security feature was largely symbolic. For two decades, multiple presidents carried around a briefcase with the allegedly constantly changing codes, though it may as well have been filled with shredded newspaper.
The code itself wasn't very secret, either. According to Karl Smallwood on Today I Found Out, Dr. Blair explained:
‚ÄúOur launch checklist in fact instructed us, the firing crew, to double-check the locking panel in our underground launch bunker to ensure that no digits other than zero had been inadvertently dialed into the panel.‚Äù
All of this basically nullifies the plot to every military thriller film from the '80s.
But it's not like our government would ever accidentally nuke us, right? Oh, they already almost did that? Nevermind.

Bogus Lawsuit is Hard to Beat
Standard Newswire / -- Catholic League president Bill Donohue comments as follows: NEW YORK, Nov. 23, 2011 // -- Catholic League president Bill Donohue comments as follows:
No segment of the population has been inundated with more bogus lawsuits than Catholic priests. This latest one out of Rhode Island is hard to top.
Some guy from Pawtucket says they were molested by a member of the New England Province of the Brothers of the Sacred Heart when they were in the seventh grade. But there are just a few problems with their tale:
the alleged abuse took place more than a half-century ago
the alleged offender is dead
the accuser never reported the offense to the authorities
the accuser never contacted the religious order
the school where this allegedly happened is closed
the accuser says they never remembered the alleged abuse until they watched a TV show about molestation in 2008
the accuser says the Penn State case has added to their pain
the accuser says they don't trust people
the accuser has been married seven times
the accuser has had 82 jobs
Their counsel, Mitchell Garabedian, is one of America's premier steeple-chasing lawyers; they are also utterly shameless and has an embarrassing track record in court.
But it's Thanksgiving, so let's look at the bright side: it suggests the Church-haters are running out of "victims" to exploit.
The highrise hotel with apartments River Oaks District developer OliverMcMillan has been promising for a couple years as a tower feature of a promised second phase of the mixed-use development will be an Equinox, according to documents submitted to the city planning department. There's already an Equinox fitness club in the River Oaks District, fronting Westheimer; the new Equinox hotel will be on the west side of Westcreek Ln., on the rear parking lot portion of the 3.4-acre Sullivan's Steakhouse‚ÄìLe Peep shopping center along Westheimer closer to the West Loop that OliverMcMillan leased almost 2 years ago.
The hotel portion of the site is 1.91 acres and set back from Westheimer. Equinox is seeking a variance from the city to allow the hotel to take access from Westcreek Ln., which further to the north also serves as an entry road for the SkyHouse River Oaks and the Wilshire condo towers.
The variance application doesn't mention how tall the building will be, but renderings of the imagined hotel dating from 2015 (below) show a structure of approximately 25 stories, with a lower parking garage immediately to the west. A shorter building is shown on the 1.5-acre southern portion of the site facing Westheimer:

Equinox says its hotel will have 200 or 214 rooms (depending on which portion of its application you follow) and 70 apartments ‚Äî presumably at the top of the structure. The building's ground floor will have room for parking, separate hotel and apartment lobbies, and a restaurant with outdoor seating, according to this plan Equinox submitted to the city:

Phase Two
Crystal Palace have completed the signing of striker Shola Ameobi on a free transfer.
The Nigerian international has signed a short-term with the Eagles until the end of the season and was a free agent after leaving Turkish side Gaziantep last month.
‚ÄúI'm very excited to be here, I wanted to get back in the Premier League and having worked with the manager before it's been great to come back and hopefully help us avoid the relegation battle,‚Äù they said.
‚ÄúI had a couple of other clubs interested but I think my relationship with Alan [Pardew] and how much I enjoyed working with them was one of the big factor in my decision.
‚ÄúHe instils confidence in players and they always seem to get the best out of them, certainly they did that at Newcastle and hopefully they can do that for me and the rest of the lads here.‚Äù
The 33-year-old is best known for their time with Newcastle United, where they spent 14 years after breaking into the first-team from their academy. In nearly a decade and a half on Tyneside they appeared 397 times for the Magpies, finding the back of the net 79 times, winning the Championship in 2009/10 and representing the club in the UEFA Champions League.
Ameobi has also won 10 caps for Nigeria where they were born before moving to Newcastle as a youngster. They represented the Super Eagles in the 2014 World Cup, having previously won 20 caps for the England under-21 side.
 They are no stranger to Palace boss Alan Pardew, having played under them for Newcastle for four years before moving to Turkey in the summer on a free after their contract expired. They scored four times in 11 outings for Gaziantep before returning to England just before the new year.
The striker will wear the number 23 shirt during their time with Palace, and is the club's third signing of the transfer window after Yaya Sanogo and Jordon Mutch.
Watch an exclusive interview with Shola on YouTube:
‚ÄòCapitol in selenium'
courtesy of ‚ÄòJoe in DC'
One of the things you learn early on in DC is the difference between the Capitol and the Capital.
One's the building, with all the trappings of government: politicians, lobbyists, fundraisers, campaigners, PACs, Super PACs, Super de Duper PACs, officials, administrators, agencies, etc.
One is the city, with all the trappings of urbanity: monuments, federal buildings, sure, but also neighborhood bars, victorian homes, housing projects, small businesses, grocery stores, and hundreds of thousands of people.
This weekend, one journalist forgot the difference, and in a fit of pique (and a glass or two of wine) blamed the Capital city for the sins of the Capitol. Jeff Jarvis is a journalism professor at NYU, and late Friday tweeted their ire. It spawned a hashtag, #fuckyouwashington, that resonated with many, and for most of the weekend it remained amid the trending topics on the social network.
It's understandable to be frustrated at the government deadlock over the debt ceiling. We're just a week or so away from defaulting as a country, which would likely throw the stuttering recall into a freefall. The game of political chicken that's currently underway has every chance to be one with fallout and casualties across the country. It's right to be upset with.
But here's the thing: Don't blame the city, when the people fighting this out are from all over. They're the least Washington of all of us, in many cases eschewing community participation in exchange for sleeping in their offices and staying away from the rest of this wonderful city.
I know what Jarvis said. I know what they meant. They meant to blame the Capitol, but what they did instead was blame the Capital.
Yes, I know that for many outside the ten miles square, Washington is synonymous with the Capitol, with the governance process for good or ill. It's a lazy shorthand, and the city deserves better.
When you consider that the people that Jarvis is angry with are sent here by every state in the Union except our own district. We have no meaningful representation in the Capitol, we have no control over what they do, so you can't blame the Capital for the sins of the Capitol, Jeff Jarvis. I think we all stand with Heather Goss, who said this weekend, ‚ÄúWhoever started #fuckyouwashington instead of #fuckyoucongress can, you know, go #fuckthemselves, too, eh?‚Äù
Right on, Heather. Right on.

The combination of lemon and baking soda has 10,000 times stronger effect than chemotherapy! Why was this fact kept as a secret? Being totally aware of the powerful properties lemon provides is completely opposite to the interest some world organisations have. For that reason, we recommend you share this article and help a friend who needs it!
Do you have any idea what's the recent number of deaths caused by the fact that this is being kept secret, in order to protect large corporations?
Numerous studies have proven the anti-cancer properties of lemon. Lemon also provides other benefits, including its strong power in treating cyst and tumors.
Lemons have the power to cure cancer, since it has been tested on all cancer types. Adding baking soda makes it even more powerful, because baking soda brings pH to normal level.
Lemon also has potent antimicrobial effect in treating bacterial and fungal infections. It is effective in the fight against internal parasites and it regulates blood pressure. Lemon is beneficial for the nervous system as well ‚Äì it is a powerful antidepressant, reducing stress and calming nerve crises.
One of the largest drug manufacturers claims that 20 laboratory experiments, conducted since 1970 until recently, proved that:
Lemon destroys cancer cells in 12 cancer types. It prevents metastasis of cancer cells and it is 10 000 stronger than drugs like Adriamycin, chemotherapy and narcotic products.
What is more interesting is the fact that the combination of lemon extract and baking soda destroys cancer cells only, without harming healthy cells and tissues.
The experiments have shown that patients diagnosed with cancer should drink lemon juice and a teaspoon of baking soda. This treatment can not cure the disastrous side effects of chemotherapy.
The best way to be sure that lemons are organic without any chemicals used is to grow this fruit in your own garden or in a pot. Organic lemons are 100 times more efficient than lemons cultivated with chemical fertilizers and treated with chemicals.
Testimonies on Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda) by Dr. Sircus
The following testimonies from the bicarbonate book highlight bicarbonate's use as a pain reliever:
‚ÄúAfter suffering from a 4 hour long blinding headache for which nothing I took brought any relief, I tried the sodium bicarbonate, 1 tsp mixed in a glass of water. Within a few short minutes I could feel the headache abating and within the hour it was completely relieved! I tried this again when another headache occurred, and it worked just as miraculously.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is the best pain reliever of all the ones I have been trying. I am amazed that something so simple would be so potent! I haven't exceeded 7 a day; but wish I could. It takes the pain away for about 2 hours. Nothing seems to work more than 2 hours at a time.‚Äù
My father was a veterinarian and as far back as I can remember (I was born in 1938 so my memory goes back to maybe 1943) they would take sodium bicarbonate dissolved in a full glass of warm water whenever they felt a cold coming on. I don't remember them ever coming down with a full blown cold. They would treat my cold symptoms likewise and I responded equally well.
They also treated farm animals for various illnesses with sodium bicarbonate via a gastric tube and they recovered quickly. So I've known about the benefits of sodium bicarbonate from early childhood on. Glad to see that its benefits are being more widely touted. Although my father was a doctor of Veterinarian medicine, they sometimes referred to themselves as an MD (Mule Doctor).

A Conservative MP's chief of staff cleared of raping a woman in a parliamentary office said they nearly became the latest victim of a miscarriage of justice because crucial evidence was withheld from their lawyers.
Samuel Armstrong, 24, said their life had been ‚Äúturned upside down‚Äù after they were wrongfully charged with two counts of rape and two of sexual assault.
They were cleared unanimously of all charges by a jury at Southwark Crown Court following a seven day trial. The jury rejected prosecution claims that they forced themselves twice on a female the woman after a drunken night at the Palace of Westminster in October last year.
It emerged that the woman, in their 20s, had not wanted to release medical records showing they suffered depression and anxiety. Phone records also revealed that hours after the ‚Äúattack‚Äù they tipped off a tabloid newspaper to try to get a sympathetic account published.
Speaking outside court, Mr Armstrong, from Danbury in Essex, said they had struggled to eat or sleep after being charged in October last year.
‚ÄúI was innocent,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúWere it not for the fact that crucial evidence was disclosed to my defence team just eight working days before trial, there could well have been yet another miscarriage of justice in this case."
YOBE Nigeria (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 29 people in a procession of Shi'ite Muslims marking the ritual of Ashoura in northeast Nigeria's Yobe state on Monday, witnesses said.
In a separate incident overnight in central Kogi state, gunmen using explosives blew their way into a prison in the city of Lokoja, killing one person and freeing 144 inmates, Adams Omale, prisons coordinator for the state, told Reuters.
In the suicide bombing in Potiskum in Yobe state, a territory at the heart of an insurgency by Sunni Muslim Boko Haram rebels, the attacker joined the line of Shi'ites before setting off their device as they marched through a market in the town, resident Yusuf Abdullahi said.
‚ÄúI heard a very heavy explosion as if it happened in my room. It took place just 200 meters from my house,‚Äù they said. Another person carrying an explosive that did not go off was arrested, they said.
Mohammed Gana, whose brother was killed in the attack, said they counted 23 bodies at the scene.
Another Potiskum resident, Abubakar Saliu, said soldiers started shooting immediately after the explosion, but it was not clear who they fired at or if anyone was hit by the gunfire.
Ashoura marks the death in battle more than 1,300 years ago of the Prophet Mohammad's grandson Imam Hussein.
Boko Haram's five-year-old campaign for an Islamic state, which has killed thousands, is seen as the main security threat to Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy and leading oil producer.
Omale said 26 of the Lokoja prison inmates freed in the Kogi raid had been recaptured. They did not comment on whether any of the escapees were Boko Haram members.
QUESTIONS OVER ‚ÄòCEASEFIRE'
Nigeria's government announced last month that a ceasefire had been agreed with Boko Haram and that talks were under way in neighboring Chad for the release of more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls abducted in April by the Islamist rebels.
But although mediator Chad has said the negotiations are still on, a spate of recent attacks across Nigeria's northeast by suspected Boko Haram fighters has raised serious doubts about whether a lasting peace pact can be achieved.
Prospects for this took another hit at the end of last week when a man claiming to be Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said in a video recording the kidnapped girls were ‚Äúmarried off‚Äù to their fighters, contradicting Nigerian government statements that they would soon be freed.
Nigeria's military says it killed Shekau a year ago, and authorities said in September they had killed an impostor posing as them in videos.
President Goodluck Jonathan, who is seeking a second term in elections in February, has faced rising criticism at home and abroad for failing to halt the Boko Haram insurgency or obtain the release of the schoolgirls.
In a statement on Monday, Nigeria's opposition All Progressives Congress accused Jonathan's government of misleading the public over the reported peace deal.
‚ÄúThe president has failed in their most sacred duty, protecting the safety and wellbeing of Nigeria's citizens,‚Äù the APC party said.
Telecom companies that provide service in Columbia are pushing back against the idea of the city government expanding broadband service by opening up its existing fiber-optic network.
Acting on a recommendation from Magellan Advisors LLC, the Denver-based telecom consulting firm hired by the cityÔøΩs Water and Light Department to study broadband service, the city has issued a request for proposals for an outside firm to develop a business plan for how Water and Light might be able to light up its existing ÔøΩdark fiberÔøΩ network, converting it to an open-access network.
The Columbia City Council approved a motion at its Aug. 18 meeting directing staff to come up with a business plan for a lit-fiber network. Assistant Water and Light Director Ryan Williams said it would likely be next summer until a business plan is hammered out.
Before approving the motion during the reports section of the councilÔøΩs agenda, in which council members can propose motions for a vote, Kevin Czaicki, area operations manager for CenturyLink in north-central Missouri, testified that having its own broadband network would present financial challenges for the city.
Czaicki also said that, if the city proceeded with the idea, it would amount to a taxpayer-subsidized entity wading into competition with private business. ÔøΩThis violates the spirit of the law, if not the rule,ÔøΩ Czaicki said.
The dark fiber network currently serves as a relay system between Water and Light electric substations and the departmentÔøΩs control center at City Hall. Water and Light leases out portions of the fiber to 30 local institutions, hospitals and business, bringing in more than $876,000 in revenue.
Magellan estimates that the city would be able to develop a broadband network to serve businesses and organizations based in the ÔøΩdowntown coreÔøΩ for a price ranging between $2.5 million and $3.5 million, which the firm suggested could be paid through debt instruments like loans and bond sales.
When discussing the idea of lighting the cityÔøΩs dark fiber, city officials have used the analogy of building a public road that would provide equal access to local Internet service providers.
ÔøΩWe would be paving a road that currently, in our opinion, does not exist now,ÔøΩ Williams said.
Michael Morey, president and CEO of the locally-based Bluebird Network, said city is running a ÔøΩterrific programÔøΩ by leasing out dark fiber and would support efforts by the city to find ways to improve broadband service. But, they said, it should do so by supporting the work that telecom companies are doing, citing the recent announcement by CenturyLink that it would offer 1-gigabit service to some Columbia and Jefferson City customers.
ÔøΩWhy not spend money on the growth of existing service providers?ÔøΩ Morey said.
Across the country, municipal governments have sought to establish local broadband networks but have come up against well-heeled lobbying efforts and barriers erected by state legislators.
ÔøΩThe fundamental motive is to make sure they limit competition to their benefit,ÔøΩ said Chris Mitchell, director of community broadband for the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. According to the institute, which is a think tank located in Washington and Minneapolis that tracks cities that have built local broadband networks, more than 380 communities have some type of public ownership of a broadband network.
Missouri is one of 19 states in which such barriers have been put into place ÔøΩ specifically that cities and counties are barred from selling telecommunications services. But according to Missouri Revised Statutes, local governments are not barred from providing telecommunication services for ÔøΩInternet-type services.ÔøΩ
The cities of Marshall, North Kansas City, Springfield and Poplar Bluff have developed local broadband networks.
Thanks to a flurry of fantastic, under-the-radar moves over the past couple weeks, the Blackhawks might now be able to afford to have Antti Niemi back on their roster for the 2010-11 season.
Because of a handful of two-way contracts added by GM Stan Bowman, it is now possible that the Blackhawks could begin the season with a 20-man roster and offer Niemi roughly $3.5M, which is closer to the range Niemi and their agent are likely looking at for at least a one-year deal to keep the Stanley Cup winning netminder in the Indianhead sweater.
Is a 20-man roster a good idea? Not always. Is it possible? Absolutely. And because of these contracts with limited exposure, the Hawks could realistically bring the minimum number of players north and make it work.
Here's how.
First off, there will be casualties. The biggest name to be left in Rockford would be Corey Crawford, the one-time top prospect who would be this year's salary cap caused demotion. Because their cap number is $250k more than Hannu Toivonen, Crawford might have to take another year with the IceHogs because of their salary.
The other big casualty would be the 21st man on the roster. But, again, it's possible for the Hawks to keep only 20 on the roster because of the salaries Bowman has handed out in the last month.
If a player on the third or fourth line wasn't getting it done, the Hawks would only be able to replace that player with comparable salary if they opted to demote said struggling forward. For example, if Jake Dowell has a terrible October and the Hawks decided to go in a different direction, the most they could add as a replacement cap number would be equal to Dowell's $525k figure.
Which is what makes all of these minimal contracts to important.
In the last few weeks, the Hawks have signed Hugh Jessiman, Jack Skille, Evan Brophey, Nathan Davis, Igor Makarov, and John Scott and added Jeff Taffe via trade. What's important about all of these deals is that they all have similar cap numbers, with the highest of the group being Skille's $600k.
Now consider this group of players.
Jessiman was the 12th overall pick in 2003. Skille was the seventh overall pick in 2005. Makarov was the 33rd overall pick in 2006. Taffe was a first round pick in 2000. Brophey was a third round pick and Davis was a fourth round selection in 2005.
All of these players, at some point in their lives, was considered a top talent.
In the case of Makarov, there were questions about their willingness to play in North America. In the case of Skille, their cap number kept them in Rockford. Jessiman and Taffe haven't performed to a level worthy of their draft slot, and Brophey and Davis have never seen the NHL.
We have established that there is talent, and a similar cap number. The other key to these players is the length of their deals; all of them except Scott has a one-year deal. So if Skille doesn't make the team, the Hawks can put them through waivers and send them to Rockford with minimal exposure long-term (like they undoubtedly will with Cristobal Huet). For the others, they can float back and forth from Rockford to Chicago on a regular basis and, because of their salaries, can replace each other regularly without a substantial impact on the Hawks' cap situation.
What is also important to remember is that the 2009-10 Stanley Cup Champion Blackhawks had a group of unknowns on their roster as well. Last year at the end of July, Troy Brouwer was a 24-year-old forward with 27 career points in the NHL. Tomas Kopecky was a 27-year-old forward with 32 career points in the NHL. In fact, Dustin Byfuglien was a 24-year-old forward with only 75 career points. Those three players, who had 134 career points entering last season, combined to score 95 last season.
To think these players, along with Dowell, Bryan Bickell and Viktor Stalberg can fill out the third and fourth lines for the Hawks is certainly a gamble, but the Blackhawks and coach Joel Quenneville now have a resume that includes winning a championship with an underwhelming group of players.
Which brings us back to keeping Niemi.
If the Blackhawks are comfortable with the potential of being limited in any way on their bench (though they were able to handle the same issue by moving players like Dowell and Bickell back and forth from Rockford within hours of a game), they could possibly offer Niemi $3.5M for next season. Here would be your potential Blackhawks roster for Opening Night:
Forwards
Patrick Kane ‚Äì Jonathan Toews ‚Äì Troy Brouwer
Marian Hossa ‚Äì Patrick Sharp ‚Äì Viktor Stalberg
Bryan Bickell ‚Äì Dave Bolland ‚Äì Tomas Kopecky
Jack Skille ‚Äì Jake Dowell ‚Äì Hugh Jessiman
Defensemen
Duncan Keith ‚Äì Brent Seabrook
Brian Campbell ‚Äì Niklas Hjalmarsson
Shawn Lalonde ‚Äì Jordan Hendry
Goalies: Antti Niemi ‚Äì Hannu Toivonen
The assumptions on this roster are that Hendry returns for the same cap number last year ($625k) and that Niemi would receive an even $3.5M for next year. This roster would be very tight financially, with under $10,000 in cap flexibility for the season. However, it fits under the cap and 14 of the 20 players would have played for the Blackhawks in the postseason last year.
If Makarov, who has a one-way contract, makes the team on the fourth line over Jessiman or another player with a $500k cap number, the difference would be $52,500 on Niemi's salary.
Also, if the assumption is that Scott, who signed a two-year deal, is both the 13th forward and seventh defenseman, is there going to be a significant loss by sending them to Rockford and saving the cap space? Scott has three points in 71 career games.
Questions will undoubtedly come from the youngsters replacing familiar faces for the Hawks in key situations. However, here are some considerations that must be made looking forward for Hawks fans:
Seven of the top 10 penalty killers (based on avg. ice time short-handed per game) will be back next year. Brent Sopel, John Madden and Colin Fraser are the three that will be gone, but that's also with Bolland playing fewer minutes because of their back injury earlier in the season. There will be players expected to play a more significant role this season, including Hjalmarsson.
Similarly, of the 12 primary power play skaters from the playoffs this spring, only two ‚Äì Dustin Byfuglien and Kris Versteeg ‚Äì will be gone next year.
It doesn't matter if the Hawks bring Niemi back for $1M or $3.5M next year, or if there are 20 or 21 on the roster, there will be supporting players that will be asked to step up to replace key departures like Byfuglien, Versteeg, Madden and Andrew Ladd on the forward lines and Sopel on the blue line. What is important is that Bowman has successfully added big bodies with a lot of talent for bargain-basement prices through free agency in July that give the organization options.
And it is those options that must be available for this team to be able to keep Niemi next year.
Google has fired its Country Lead for Kenya Olga Arara-Kimani and ‚Äúa technical guy in Zurich‚Äù, the Kenyan tech blog Nairobi Tech reports.
While the information hasn't been officially announced, it seems to be confirmed by a message Google's VP for EMEA Nelson Motta posted on Google + last Friday:
We've concluded our investigation into the serious allegations about our use of data from Mocality's website in Kenya. We're very sorry this happened. We've taken appropriate action with the people involved and made changes in our operations to ensure this doesn't occur again.
As you may remember, Kenya's largest business directory Mocality had recently criticized Google's unethical business practices in the country.
According to Mocality, Google representatives had been using its database to promote Google's competing product, while misleading Mocality's clients on the existing relationship between the two companies.
The news rapidly became viral, tarnishing Google's image ‚Äì unfair competition against an African business doesn't go very well with the company's ‚ÄúDon't be evil‚Äù mantra. A serious PR crisis was looming, which could annihilate the impact of Google's initiatives in the region.
At the time, Google promptly apologized, saying it was ‚Äúmortified‚Äù and announcing an internal investigation.
It may have taken a few weeks, but the results are there; the company took action and finally fired two employees, although their involvement in those malpractices is still unclear. We will update this article if Google releases more details.

‚ÄúThe reality is that this will take time, but what fans really buy into is what the media show and fans are created by what the media push out.
‚ÄúIf you look at London 2012 we had limited live coverage and again in Rio. But, in the grand scheme of things, it's very little.‚Äù

Smyth is particularly critical of the coverage of this year's World Championships in London.
‚ÄúWe had four gold medals and three silvers,‚Äù they say.
‚ÄúCan you tell me any Irish team that's going to be that successful this year? We probably aren't going to have one.
‚ÄúAnd yet I got far more British media coverage than I did in Ireland. Even random countries around the world did more with me than Irish media did. That seems wrong considering I'm Irish and running for Ireland.
‚ÄúAnd yet, I don't remember seeing any Irish media straight after I won my event. I mean, London's an hour away on a cheap Ryanair flight.
‚ÄúIt's great for them to come to the airport a few days later but the point of the media is the impact of ‚Äòright now'.
‚ÄúIf you look at news, you don't cover news three days later because it's already been covered, you cover it right there when it happens and, for me and for para-sport in general to have an impact, you've got to cover it right away.
‚ÄúI also think that big brands can come in and help change that because they have more power to make change than athletes do. They can help with a change in mindset.‚Äù

One big brand to partner with Paralympics Ireland is Toyota, who yesterday announced a deal with the organisation and the 2020 and 2024 Paralympic teams.
It's the kind of sponsor the Derry native believes will lend more credibility to their sport.
‚ÄúThe plus side for Irish sport in general is that, I've been competing since 2005 and I've seen it change massively and we're now seeing more and more big organisations coming on board which means the sport is moving in the right direction.
‚ÄúIt's not going to happen overnight, but it's moving in the right direction.
‚ÄúThere are two sides to it really. For the Paralympic movement, it's hugely important and, even though we have some sponsors on board, the reality is that, the more sponsors you have, the more it increases the credibility of Paralympic sport.
‚ÄúWhat it also does for the sport is increase awareness and they try to promote the sport which, in turn, benefits the athletes because we have a better platform to show what we do.
‚ÄúAt a personal level, it's great that companies like Toyota come on board and support you as an individual because, at the end of the day I'm outcompeting and performing for myself, but it gives you the opportunity to increase your profile and gives you more recognition.‚Äù

Having a sponsor come to your door is also a lot easier than having to go out and find one, but there are still challenges if the company doesn't share the same ethos for the sport as the athlete, says Smyth.
‚ÄúI can't speak for all sports but, within Paralympic sport, athletes would always be putting feelers out for sponsorship. When you have instances where sponsors come on and support the movement then it's a natural fit that ambassadors come on board too.
‚ÄúOutside of that, you'd have to go searching for them. But, the reality is, you can search as much as you want for them but not every brand sits with what you're trying to do, so it's about finding something that fits and works for you and works for them.‚Äù

President-elect Donald Trump is moving the transition meetings Friday from Trump Tower in New York to Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, said transition team officials.
The transition team did not provide details of who Mr. Trump will meet with at the exclusive private golf club about 35 miles west of Manhattan.
The club, part of the Trump Organizations portfolio of world-class golf resorts, sits on 600 acres nestled in the suburban enclave of Bedminster.
The course, which has been rated in the ‚ÄúTop 100 in the World,‚Äù has been chosen to host the 2017 U.S. Women's Open and the 2022 PGA Championship, according to the club's website.
The transition team did not immediately respond to questions about whether Mr. Trump planed to golf over the weekend.
Mr. Trump's meeting schedule Thursday at Trump Tower included former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, retired Army Gen. Jack Keane and former Cincinnati Mayor Ken Blackwell.

Women have left an incredible literary legacy, with their works earning international acclaim, awards and coveted places on prestigious reading lists and syllabi the world over. Obviously, a list such as this comes saddled with a whole heap of subjectivity, so try to keep the blood pressure down if a personal favorite's been omitted. Plenty more amazing authors warrant exploration than space and time allow, so use these amazing reads as a jumping-off point to discovering even more!
Novels
The Awakening by Kate Chopin: While not an explicitly feminist work, Kate Chopin's novel certainly laid the foundation by exploring the thoughts of a woman breaking free from social expectations. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley: The limber, hyperintelligent creature and their monstrous creator at the center of this landmark literary work still resonates throughout today's manic pop culture sphere. Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel: Magic realism, tantalizing food and forbidden romance blend to create a wholly satisfying read ‚Äî even for those who normally find love stories repellent. The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu: Most, though not all, literature aficionados consider The Tale of Genji humanity's first modern novel. Beyond its historical significance, the book is notable for its slice-of-life plot, hundreds of characters and painstaking attention to continuity. Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe: Harriet Beecher Stowe's abolitionist leanings inspired them to write a sympathetic portrayal of Southern slaves, further stoking pre-Civil War social, political and economic tensions. Ceremony by Leslie Marmon Silko: Protagonist Tayo's half-Laguna, half-white heritage isolates them from both backgrounds in spite of their World War II heroism. Such pain drives them to find solace in Native American spirituality. The Color Purple by Alice Walker: This Pulitzer and National Book Award winner channeled the horrific exploitation and marginalization of impoverished, female minorities during the 1930s. In spite of the torment, however, an undercurrent of hope and love still trickle throughout. The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan: Two generations of Chinese and Chinese-American women suffer cultural differences, but ultimately learn that family is absolutely the most important thing of all. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen: Although modern audiences tend to focus on romanticizing Mr. Darcy, Jane Austen's Regency classic was actually quite the bitter, scathing satire of their time. Their Eyes were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston: Set in steamy Florida, hero Janie Crawford grows into an incredibly strong woman after a harrowing series of heartbreaks, traumas and setbacks.
Nonfiction
Plays
Topdog/Underdog by Suzan-Lori Parks: Two brothers with the bitterly ironic names Lincoln and Booth grapple against their mutual love and hate for one another until things finally go straight to Hell. A Raisin in the Sun by Lorraine Hansberry: One of America's most influential and beloved dramas, A Raisin in the Sun follows a family whose financial and interpersonal struggles revolve around making and breaking dreams. The Vagina Monologues by Eve Ensler: Eve Ensler meant for their humorous, poignant reflection of female genitalia to comment on American society's propensity for shaming and making taboo human sexuality. Spreading the News by Lady Gregory: A popular comedy in one act, Lady Gregory utilized common character archetypes to poke fun at certain elements of Early 20th Century Irish society. White Biting Dog by Judith Thompson: Canada's lauded experimental playwright earned a bevy of accolades and awards for their story of a suicidal youth and the titular canine who gives them a second chance at life and family. Gone Too Far! by Bola Agbaje: This slice-of-life drama explores race relations in contemporary London, drawing from playwright Bola Agbaje's own experiences. How I Learned to Drive by Paula Vogel: Driving and the utter control it represents parallels the inappropriate, tense, sexual relationship between a confused young woman and their deeply troubled uncle. Blood Relations by Sharon Pollock: Another cornerstone of contemporary Canadian theatre, Sharon Pollock chilled audiences with their seriously scary and highly psychological drama about Lizzie Bordon's life. The Mousetrap by Agatha Christie: Even detractors of the mystery genre should give The Mousetrap some credit. It is, after all, the longest-running play of all time, credited with over 24,000 performances since 1952. In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play) by Sarah Ruhl: Taking place in the Victorian era, this fearless drama peers into the prominent female repression, sexual dissatisfaction and the surprising medical origins of the vibrator.

It's been a crazy offseason in the AFC East. Everything is seemingly going wrong for the division favorites, the New England Patriots. No WRs return to the team, Gronkowski went through surgery and won't be back by week 1 and now Tom Brady's final target, Aaron Hernandez is in major legal trouble. Playing against New England will essentially be the Jets vs Tom Brady and Stevan Ridley. Earlier in the offseason I wrote a few articles on moves the Jets would have to make to become a competitive team in the division. Now, with all the trouble the Pats are going through, there's one move that can make the Jets truly a favorite in the division (and not just by a long shot)
PICK UP BRANDON LLOYD ‚Äì I don't understand how he's still on the wire. He's a player the Pats are likely going to have to go after if they want to give Brady any kind of weapon to throw to. Who else is out there for them? Chad Ochocinco? Not only will picking them up push the Pats into a corner, but the Jets receiving corps needs insurance (to say the least). There's a chance Stephen Hill can be a great #2 WR and Santonio Holmes will hold down the #1 spot. But Stephen Hill is still dropping balls in practice and Santonio is coming off a major injury, so whether or not they return to the path they were on last season is a big question mark. Picking up a proven #1 target like Brandon Lloyd GUARANTEES that there's a solid #1 and a super solid #2 in Holmes. Holmes, coming off injury will also be a lot less pressured. All of the sudden the Jets look like they can be the favorite for the AFC East. Let's look at the Jets vs the AFC East with the acquisition of Lloyd:
JETS
QB ‚Äì Geno Smith/A Much Improved Mark Sanchez (I think Geno will start, the only way they don't is if Sanchez starts playing like Matt Stafford)
RB ‚Äì Chris Ivory
RB ‚Äì Mike Goodson (can be solid, gained 100+ yards in every game he's started in)
WR ‚Äì Brandon Lloyd
WR ‚Äì Santonio Holmes
WR ‚Äì Jeremy Kerley
TE ‚Äì Kellen Winslow
PATS
QB ‚Äì Tom Brady, Tim Tebow
RB ‚Äì Stevan Ridley
RB ‚Äì Shane Vereen
WR ‚Äì Danny Amendola
WR ‚Äì Mike Jenkins
WR ‚Äì Julian Edelmen
TE ‚Äì Daniel Fells
BILLS
QB ‚Äì EJ Manuel/Kevin Kolb
RB ‚Äì CJ Spiller
RB ‚Äì Fred Jackson
WR ‚Äì Stevie Johnson
WR ‚Äì Robert Woods
WR ‚Äì TJ Graham
TE ‚Äì Scott Chandler
DOLPHINS
QB ‚Äì Ryan Tannehill
RB ‚Äì Lamar Miller
RB ‚Äì Daniel Thomas
WR ‚Äì Mike Wallace

TE ‚Äì Dustin Keller
Right there on paper, the Jets seem like they'd be neck and neck with Miami for the AFC East. Rex Ryan will also most likely have them put up a top 5 defense. In each of their seasons except last and one wih the Ravens (where it's been ranked #7) he's fielded a top 5 defense. Last year they were the 7th best in the NFL, considering they lost their best player in week 2 and had to adjust, I'd say that's pretty damn impressive. Now Rex knows who they have and picked up the players they think would contribute most in the first round. This pushes the Jets ahead of Miami in my book. Just imagine if they were able to add a back like Michael Turner who is in a similar situation as Tomlinson was back in 2010. Now all of the sudden the Jets seem like they can compete with almost any AFC team.
QB ‚Äì Geno Smith
RB ‚Äì Michael Turner
RB ‚Äì Chris Ivory/Mike Goodson
WR ‚Äì Brandon Lloyd
WR ‚Äì Santonio Holmes
WR ‚Äì Jeremy Kerley
TE ‚Äì Kellen Winslow
How could the above lineup not inspire any Jets fans to buy tickets to game #1 vs Revis and the Bucs?
Recently, I was getting a hot towel shave at one of those barbershops where the barbers have full tattoo sleeves and lush beards and everything is a little too expensive. It's relaxing. Part of the appeal, besides that it simply feels great, is that it's something men do, have always done, and even by today's more progressive cultural standards is totally fine. It's ritualistic, a way to invoke the mores of masculinity ‚Äî ‚Äúwe men‚Äù ‚Äî without having to open and unpack any of the baggage.
I've been trying to figure out how to root for a team that includes Derrick Rose. I can't say that I know. In August 2015, a woman with whom Rose had a previous relationship accused them and two friends, Randall Hampton and Ryan Allen, of raping them in their apartment in August 2013. She's seeking $21.5 million in damages. The civil case (no criminal charges were ever filed) had been making its way through U.S. District Court in Los Angeles since last season. When the Knicks acquired Rose in June, awareness of the case increased. But it wasn't until September, when ThinkProgress published a detailed piece, quoting public court documents, that the substance of the allegations became widely known.
This week, Rose's accuser, who is being publicly identified only as Jane Doe, told their side of the story to the press for the first time. This is what they told ThinkProgress in an interview conducted on September 13:
As a Knicks fan, it would be easy for me to decide that Rose's civil case doesn't matter, and that off-court issues should stay there. But I cannot read those words and believe that it doesn't matter.
Sports are an escape from life's quotidian problems, so it's not surprising that fans react with vexation when those problems ‚Äî representing the real world ‚Äî intrude. We treat athletes as characters in a story. Market forces turn those characters into brands. When those athletes do something delightful and on-brand ‚Äî J.R. Smith strutting around shirtless, for example ‚Äî we're only too eager to highlight it. When they do something outside of that box, we become annoyed ‚Äî stick to sports! If they do something bad, more often than not we simply ignore it.
I was talking with some friends about the Rose situation recently. One said something about sexual assault by athletes being a ‚Äúhot topic right now.‚Äù I was struck by how accurate the statement was ‚Äî the issue of athletes and sexual violence is increasingly part of the discussion around professional and amateur sports ‚Äî and also how incredibly sad. To put it another way: After many, many years in which assaults of this sort have surely occurred, it has only recently become commonplace to think about what that means.
The Derrick Rose court documents are available on the internet. I urge you to read them. The two sides agree on very little. What they do agree on: Rose and the accuser dated nonexclusively for two years. They had already broken up when, on August 26, 2013, Jane Doe and a friend attended a party at Rose's home in Los Angeles. Doe went home around midnight. Hours later, Rose and two friends arrived at Doe's apartment, where they had sex with them
The sides disagree on whether Doe was inebriated, whether Rose and their friends broke into their apartment, and, crucially, whether Doe consented to sex with all three men.
No one, except the persons involved, can know what occurred that night, sometime around 3 a.m., in Doe's apartment. According to Rose's deposition, Rose had asked Doe numerous times during their relationship, in person and via text, to engage in group sex. They had always declined. That refusal, according to text messages attached to court documents, played a role in Rose and Doe breaking up months before the incident.
To agree with Rose's version of events, then, is to believe that Jane Doe, though they had never before agreed ‚Äî again, per Rose's testimony ‚Äî to participate in group sex, decided to have consensual sex with Rose and two other men in August 2013, and is now lying about it. Maybe that's what happened. Maybe Rose placing their used condom back in its wrapper and taking it away with him, as they stated they did in their deposition, is no big deal. I don't find Rose's version of events believable. The trial is scheduled to begin on October 4. Perhaps the evidence presented there will change my mind.
One thing I doubt I'll change my mind about is Rose's attorneys' continuing attempts to reveal Doe's identity, partially based on their Instagrams being ‚Äúsexual in nature.‚Äù
From the District Court judge's ruling on whether to publicly identify the plaintiff: ‚ÄúDefendant Rose argues as follows:‚Äù
This is gross. It's also Sexual Assault Case Defense 101. The main reason to do it is to embarrass an accuser into taking a settlement or dropping a case altogether. The judge responded to Rose's argument by saying:
How do I root for a team with Derrick Rose on it? I don't know.
Rooting for people because they wear a shirt with the name of your city across the chest is a strange thing. If you're a fan of something, at some point or another, you've likely been a hypocrite. I've cheered for athletes who have been accused of doing awful things, enjoyed music and films created by those who have acted monstrously. The simplest explanation for this: It was easy and expedient. It cost me nothing. Wrestling with that is a shitty feeling. A worse feeling knows that if Rose were still a superstar, and if the Knicks were a better team, it would be even easier to sit back and let the rituals go on as before. To separate the player's on-court exploits from the person. It's just what many of us have been doing all along.
I've been trying to imagine how I'll feel watching Rose lead the Knicks on a fast break. Or hitting a game winner. How do I root for a person when, in the context of the real world, I believe that person acted abominably? Maybe just asking the question is enough. It doesn't feel like it, though.
LONDON ‚Äî Sir Richard Branson, the founder and CEO of the Virgin group, a ¬£15 billion multinational conglomerate, announced Saturday that he, and their company, would boycott hotels owner by the Sultan of Brunei due to the country's anti-gay laws.
AP
‚ÄúNo Virgin employee, nor our family, will stay at Dorchester Hotels until the Sultan abides by basic human rights,‚Äù Branson said, in a post on Twitter.
Branson joins a growing number of celebrities, including Ellen DeGeneres, Sharon Osborne and Stephen Fry, who are boycotting the Dorchester Hotel Group, owned by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.
The tiny Southeast Asian nation has adopted a form of Islamic Sharia criminal law that includes harsh penalties such as amputation for theft and death by stoning for same-sex sexual activity.
Sultan Bolkiah has hailed the law as a ‚Äúgreat achievement‚Äù for Brunei, but international rights groups and the United Nations has condemned it as a step backward for human rights.
Article continues below
The Dorchester Hotel Group is a collection of 10 luxury properties in the U.S. and Europe, owned by the Brunei Investment Agency, a government-owned corporation controlled by Bolkiah.
Dorchester properties include the famed Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles, The Dorcester and 45 Park Lane in London, Le Meurice and Hotel Plaza Athenee in Paris, Le Richemond in Geneva, Hotel Eden in Rome, Hotel Principe di Savoia in Milan, and Coworth Park in Berkshire, U.K.
Last month, a group of high-dollar LGBT donors cancelled plans to hold a conference at the Beverly Hills Hotel in response to Brunei's new penal code.

TWICE Exclusive! On June 6, General Electric handed off its iconic, 125-year-old appliance business to Chinese majap giant Qingdao Haier for $5.6 billion.
Although the ink is still drying on the contract, change is already afoot in Louisville, Ky., where GE Appliances (GEA) reigns, and in Wayne, N.J., headquarters of Haier America, Haier's eponymous U.S. operation.
What lies ahead for GE under new ownership, and what does it mean to GE's retail customers? In the following industry-exclusive Q&A, Robert Posthauer, sales VP of GE Appliances, now a Haier company, addresses those issues and more.
TWICE: Have there been any changes at GEA since Haier formally acquired the business in June, whether material or cultural?
Our GEA leadership remains in place and continues to be led by [president/CEO] Chip Blankenship. Our headquarters remains in Louisville. We have recently announced our leadership team for our new combined sales organization: I will be VP of sales, and Paul Riley from Haier America will report to me while supporting their Haier sales team.
TWICE: What do you expect will be the first fruits of your new ownership?
We have been working to accelerate our timetable as we have quickly uncovered synergies to expand our business by filling product gaps on each side. We are collaborating across teams responding to almost daily inquiries on new growth opportunities.
TWICE: Will GEA and Haier America continue to operate as two separate businesses? Is there an opportunity to pool sales, distribution and other services?
For the remainder of 2016, current operations and processes will remain in place for each team. In 2017, we will launch with combined processes, systems and product portfolios building on what works successfully today.
GE made its trade debut as a Haier company at last week's Nationwide Marketing Group show.
TWICE: Will GEA and Haier America coordinate their go-to-market brand and channel strategies? Do you anticipate a melding of brand families?
We will go to market in 2017 as a house of brands providing a broad selection of brands and products that will serve our customers and our owners well. Our commitment to be the easiest company to do business with and our ability to serve customers with industry-leading distribution and service will carry forward in our new organization across brands.
TWICE: Will GEA and Haier America share their U.S. production? How will Haier's Camden, S.C., manufacturing facilities be utilized?
The Camden factory is now part of a much larger business, with great potential for growth as we integrate the business's relationships and infrastructure.
However, there is still a lot to learn about each other's manufacturing capabilities and opportunities. We currently have a team exploring what that future could look like and we are encouraged by the early feedback, but we have made no firm decisions at this time. We want to get it right.
TWICE: What has been the reaction of GEA's retail customers to the sale? What have been their chief concerns?
Our customers have been amazing and supportive through this entire process. They have supported us from day one. We have committed to being transparent and focused on running the business for them. Together, it has been a successful journey.
Their biggest concern has been whether GE Appliances' processes will change. We have listened and are committed to bringing what we do well into our new world.
TWICE: How has or will the acquisition change the day-to-day manner in which your customers conduct business with GEA?
We will offer an expanded brand portfolio and new products. We will invest in new technologies and improved ways to support our customers, but the fundamental ways we conduct business will not change. We are committed to being the easiest company with which to do business, playing to our strengths of an experienced sales team, powerful brands, and great logistics and service.
TWICE: How much autonomy does GEA have in managing its business?
As part of the Haier Group we are now the largest appliance company in the world. That size brings scale and technology from across the globe.
That being said, we are going to be held accountable for U.S. operations. Led by our customers, we will continue to deliver the local expertise that is unique to the U.S. appliance industry.
TWICE: How does ownership by Haier compare to life under GE?
It is exciting to be part of a company that wakes up every day thinking about appliances ‚Äî just like we do. We love the opportunity and see an incredibly bright future.
Rockets fired at both Israel and Jordan on Monday and which killed one Jordanian citizen were fired by terror groups aiming to thwart attempts at reaching peace in the Middle East, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday.
Benjamin Netanyahu speaking during the weekly cabinet meeting at their Jerusalem office, July 25, 2010. AP
Jordanian and Israeli police said that rockets from Egypt's Sinai, where Islamist militants have operated in the past, hit Israel's and Jordan's Red Sea port resorts, killing a Jordanian civilian and injuring three others.
Speaking to both Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah II in the wake of the rocket attack, Netanyahu said that the "criminal attack on innocent civilians in both Israel and Jordan was instigated by terror groups who want to sabotage the peace process."
"All of the region's nations that aspire to peace must fight against these forces in order to distance peace and bring peace closer," the PM added.
Jordanian Minister of State Ali al-Ayed said the kingdom would continue its "fight against terrorists who undertake callous attacks that target innocent people".
President Shimon Peres condemned the rocket fire and said Israel and Jordan, who made peace in 1994, were "partners in the uncompromising struggle to eradicate terrorism".
"There is a real struggle in the Middle East between the peace camp of moderate countries and the camp of extremists, who want to sabotage any chance for peace," Peres said.

news Ontario Shouldn't Abandon its Shift to Renewable Energy
Time to close the Pickering Power Plant?
Donald Trump wants to breathe new life into the dying coal industry. So does Canada's deeply conservative Fraser Institute, which recently decreed that a little air pollution was nothing to get worked up about. Meanwhile, Ontario has now been enjoying the benefits of living without dirty coal power for three years and has seen a large drop in both smog days and power-sector greenhouse gas emissions.
But after taking the bold step of phasing out coal and introducing incentives for the development of clean renewable energy, it is increasingly looking like Ontario's energy transition has stalled. The province recently cancelled the latest round of its Large Renewable Procurement effort‚Äîin which power developers bid to develop large wind and solar projects‚Äîand announced the end of its Feed-in Tariff program, which encouraged tens of thousands of Ontarians to install solar panels and really kickstarted the development of the province's green energy industry.
So what has changed? To start with, the province is swimming in surplus power. When you keep three of the world's largest nuclear stations operating in an era when electricity demand is dropping thanks to economic changes (less heavy industry), technological changes (super efficient LED lighting), and behavioural changes (people and companies embracing conservation to save money), you end up with a lot of power nobody needs. That's because nuclear plants do not turn on or off with a flick of a switch‚Äîit can take days for reactors to be powered down or powered up.
This kind of ‚Äúdumb‚Äù power flies in the face of our increasingly intelligent systems, where devices can be told to power down or adjust settings in seconds. But Ontario remains almost as deeply wedded to antiquated nuclear technology as Donald Trump is to 19th century coal.
Our power planners love nuclear energy, and the nuclear industry insists it is a low-cost source of power. Of course, they don't add that publicly-owned Ontario Power Generation just applied for an 180 per cent increase in the price it is paid for the power generated by its nuclear plants, or that the aging Pickering Nuclear Station on Toronto's doorstep has the highest operating costs of any nuclear station in North America, requiring a billion dollars annually to subsidize its operating deficit.
No other jurisdiction in the world outside of France relies as heavily on nuclear power as Ontario. It is an astonishing dependence at a time when costs for renewable sources like wind and solar continue to decline dramatically‚Äîbut not one that Premier Kathleen Wynne's government seems to be in any hurry to shake.
In fact, the government has given the green light to OPG's application to continue to operate the 46-year-old Pickering station until at least 2024. Pickering is the fourth oldest nuclear station in North America. It is now surrounded by more than two million people, and it has a long history of serious incidents and breakdowns, including the closure of four reactors in the 1990s due to safety concerns (two were later restarted at a cost of billions of dollars, after which it was decided it made no economic sense to restart the other two).
No sane person would locate one of the world's oldest and largest nuclear stations, with six reactors, in the middle of the country's largest urban area today. But that hasn't stopped the Wynne government from cheerleading for the continued operation of the outdated plant for another decade or more. The excuse: that we need Pickering's power while we rebuild the aging reactors at the Darlington Nuclear Station, 20 kilometres to the east.
But here's the thing: only half of the power Pickering produces is actually used in Ontario. The rest is exported to our American neighbours, at a large financial loss to us. Meanwhile, our neighbour to the east‚ÄîQuebec‚Äîis sitting on a growing surplus of low-cost water power that could not only replace Pickering's power right now, it could help us avoid wasting billions on rebuilding Darlington as well.
No nuclear project in Ontario's history has ever been completed on time or on budget, though. Despite all the happy talk coming from the government and the nuclear industry, it will be no different this time. Opening up and replacing the guts of a 30-year-old reactor is a massively complex and risky task full of unknowns. And it always ends badly for electricity ratepayers.
Last October, Ontario signed a modest deal with Quebec to import enough water power each year to keep the lights on in a small city‚Äîthink London or North Bay. Oddly, the Wynne government has gone to great lengths to avoid talking about what it is paying for this power. However, thanks to Quebec media, we know it is five cents per kilowatt-hour. Five cents per kilowatt-hour is less than a third of what OPG is seeking to get for its nuclear output by 2026.
With our current transmission line connections with Quebec, we could already be importing enough power to entirely replace the power coming from Pickering that we actually use in Ontario. If we invested roughly $2 billion in additional transmission ties, we could also replace much of the power from Darlington. Two billion dollars sounds like a lot, until you consider that OPG is planning to spend $13 billion on Darlington‚Äîand that's a highly optimistic estimate.
Quebec has more than enough export power available and can, in fact, dramatically increase its export supplies by improving both its low levels of energy efficiency and by tapping its huge wind power potential. As it is, Quebec has power available for export in every month of the year and virtually every hour of the day (99 per cent availability). Compare that to our nuclear stations: Darlington is out 17 per cent of the time, while Pickering is out 30 per cent of the time, requiring natural gas back up.
Just as returning to dirty coal makes absolutely no sense, neither does clinging to outdated nuclear technology with its high risks and increasingly high costs. Instead of echoing Donald Trump's nostalgia for the dirty and dangerous past, we need to embrace the future of high efficiency, low carbon, and renewable power. With a worldwide surge in renewable energy development, this is no time for Ontario to be left in the dust.

SOPA, the House version of the US Senate's PROTECT-IP Bill, might be the worst-ever copyright proposal in US legislative history. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has begun a series of articles examining the bill in depth, explaining just how insane it is. Here's part one:
If an IP rightsholder (vaguely defined ‚Äì could be Justin Bieber worried about their publicity rights) thinks you meet the criteria and that it is in some way harmed, it can send a notice claiming as much to the payment processors (Visa, Mastercard, Paypal etc.) and ad services you rely on.
Once they get it, they have 5 days to choke off your financial support. Of course, the payment processors and ad networks won't be able to fine-tune their response so that only the allegedly infringing portion of your site is affected, which means your whole site will be under assault. And, it makes no difference that no judge has found you guilty of anything or that the DMCA safe harbors would shelter your conduct if the matter ever went to court. Indeed, services that have been specifically found legal, like Rapidshare, could be economically strangled via SOPA. You can file a counter-notice, but you've only got 5 days to do it (good luck getting solid legal advice in time) and the payment processors and ad networks have no obligation to respect it in any event. That's because there are vigilante provisions that grant them immunity for choking off a site if they have a ‚Äúreasonable belief‚Äù that some portion of the site enables infringement.
Today, the city of Vinge, Denmark, is nothing more than a grassy field with two railroad tracks running through it. By 2033, it'll be a full-fledged town. The 350 hectares of land will be home to an estimate 20,000 residents, many of whom will likely use Vinge's train station to commute to and from Denmark's larger cities.
This train station is the centerpiece of the small town's urban plan, and with good reason. Designed by Danish architecture firm Henning Larsen in collaboration with landscape architecture firm Tredje Natur, the station smartly and subtly blurs the line between the built and natural environments. Unlike jagged glass buildings that are supposed to echo the nearby mountains or integrating a living wall as an afterthought, Vinge's station blends seamlessly into Denmark's hilly topography without looking out of place among the buildings that surround it.
Henning Larsen Architects
As passengers step out onto the platform they'll see an opening framed by an elliptical-shaped concrete structure. This piece of concrete functions as a pathway, bridging the two opposite sides of the platform and preventing the ‚Äúwrong side of the tracks‚Äù mentality that's often the result of separating neighborhoods with infrastructure. The concrete bowl, 90 meters in diameter, dips down to the platform's level before rising again to around 12 meters at its highest point. This gives passengers an easy pathway through the city center, but by matching the natural topography of Vinge, it also allows green space to creep into the plan as easily as possible. A nice added touch: The lines you see on the concrete renderings are tracks that gather rainwater and direct it into a pool on the platform to be used as a splashing pool.
When the station opens in 2017, there will be a few surrounding buildings that house offices, a grocery store and some residential spaces that open with it. It'll still be an oasis, but over the next decade, as more and more people move to Vinge, the station will become a proper city center where residents can lounge on the platform, use it as an amphitheater or have a picnic with goods purchased at the market.
Nina la Cour Sell, an architect at Henning Larsen, says that ultimately, they envision the station as a welcoming post for Vinge. The platform should draw people out of the train and prod them to explore the new town. The big hope here is that Vinge will be a demonstrator of a new kind of urban space, one that uncompromisingly couples nature with the city and draws a progressive crowd to stay there. ‚ÄúIt's always been you either you want to live in the city and be close to everything, or you really want to go out and have a big garden and be close to nature,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúThis is a city that should be able to embody both of those desires.‚Äù
AMD announced the Radeon R7 and R9 series of ‚ÄúHawaii‚Äù graphics cards and cores on Wednesday, an attempt to storm the pinnacle of performance PC graphics.
AMD broadcast what it called its ‚ÄúGPU 14 Tech Day Event‚Äù from Hawaii, where the company had offered to host reporters at its expense. PCWorld covered the event via webcast.
AMD's Hawaii chips are based on what the company calls its Graphics Core Next architecture, the second generation of which is contained within the Hawaii cores. AMD launched the R9 and R7 series as a top-to-bottom approach: the R9 is for performance gamers, and the R7 series is aimed at the lower-budget customer.
Matt Skynner, general manager for the graphics business unit, told the audience that AMD's plan was ‚Äúto create unified Radeon gaming experience across all platforms,‚Äù from mobile to to the cloud with the Radeon Sky gaming strategy. Skynner highlighted the developers behind the Crysis and Tomb Raider series, and noted that AMD powers all three major game consoles. The PC graphics hardware market is growing to $21 billion in 2017, according to Jon Peddie Research‚Äîproof that gamers have the budget for high-end cards.
AMD
AMD is able to let developers port games from one platform to another, with tools as well as an architecture that makes it easy to do so, Skynner said. ‚ÄúAnd what's important is not that we're trying to drive the industry from a performance view, we're trying to put reality on the screen‚Äù with innovations like TressFx, AMD's hair-modeling system, and depth of field and shadowing, plus its EyeFinity multi-monitor technology.
‚ÄùHow can you draw the user in more?‚Äù Skynner said. ‚ÄúAs these great games come out, they want more graphics cards. And we've got to be ready for them.‚Äù
AMD's archrival is Nvidia, which launched the current god of the gaming world, the GTX Titan, in February for a whopping $999. That card, which contains 2,688 graphics cores, was followed by the slightly more affordable GTX 780, with 2,304 cores for $649.
AMD will launch five chips: the $89 R7 250 (1GB of DRAM / 2,000+ scores in the 3DMark FireStrike benchmark), the $199 R7 260X (2GB / 3700+), the $199 R9 270X (2GB / 5500+), the $380 R9 280X (3GB / 6800+), and the R9 290X (4GB), which wasn't priced. (The R9 290X reportedly contains four independent tessellation units, close to 3,000 stream processors, and a 512-bit wide GDDR5 memory interface.) An R9 290X bundle with the hit game Battlefield 4 will also be released for an undisclosed price.
The Maingear Shift
Maingear appeared on stage to announce the Maingear Shift, with cooling for up to three Radeon GPUs. It will be available in the coming weeks, executives said.
The three pillars of ‚ÄúHawaii‚Äù
Raja Koduri, AMD's corporate vice president of visual computing, said that there are three technology pillars for the R9 290 series; the GCN (Graphics Core Next) series, UltraHD (4K resolutions), and audio. The R9 290 series is the first to power DirectX 11.2 games, and offers a whopping 5 GFLOPS of compute power, Koduri said. AMD also designed for lower-power efficiency: this architecture is capable of scaling from 1-watt devices to 1-kilowatt workstations, they said.
To compute capabilities is complemented by over 300Gbytes/s of memory bandwidth, about 20 percent more than 2002's Radeon 9700. The memory is necessary to render high-resolution content: 100 layers of complex rendering at 4K resolutions, they said. The chip renders over 4 billion triangles per second. ‚ÄúWe have done this because we see the trend of incredibly high-resolution games coming our way this holiday season and next year.‚Äù
AMD's Raja Koduri announced the new graphics cards in a presentation from Hawaii.
AMD began putting in manual configuration options for its Eyefinity multi-monitor approach when it first introduced the technology. Now, AMD's technology will automatically configure 4K displays, and the company proposed a new standard to the VESA standards body to auto-configure them, which were accepted, Koduri said.
And with the R9 series, AMD launched TrueAudio, which Koduri said is to audio what programmable shading technology did for graphics‚Äîa differentiating feature that gave games like Crysis 3 a distinctive look and feel. ‚ÄúI believe that True Audio technology will provide the same artistic freedom to audio artists at these gaming companies,‚Äù they said.
TrueAudio will enable gamers to hear hundreds of audio channels in the game, as well as immersive, directional audio that pull directional data directly from the game, from multi-speaker configurations down to two-speaker headphone setups. TrueAudio will be supported on the R9 290 and 290x and one of the R7 chips, Koduri said.
‚ÄùTo bring professional-grade audio to the industry requires processor horsepower,‚Äù GenAudio CEO Jerry Mahabub said‚Äînot the CPU, but offloading it to the GPU. GenAudio focuses on 3D audio, but other developers are working on reverberation and spatial modeling, both keys to helping create a ‚Äútrue audio‚Äù experience. (Aureal Semiconductor pioneered HRTF positional sound several years ago, using dummy heads; Mahabub said GenAudio's model is based on how the brain perceives sound, based on data collected from MRI scans.)
Reverberations will be the next generation of audio in games like Thief, a developer from Eidos Montreal said.
Earlier this year, we posted an article about the Turkey Family Ministry conducting an investigation into whether Minecraft was ‚ÄúViolent‚Äù or not. The grounds of the investigation were simple ‚Äì Minecraft encourages PVP, and PVP is killing people, so it's bad.
While they were simple, the grounds were also insane, on the grounds that 95% of video games could be considered ‚Äúviolent‚Äù. In fact, most of the other games that I play apart from Minecraft are violent in some form or another. Think about Battlefield, CoD and GTA.
Today, the Family and Social Policies Ministry has concluded their probe, and are now calling on authorities to ban the game. The report reads ‚ÄúAlthough the game can be seen as encouraging creativity in children by letting them build houses, farmlands and bridges, mobs [hostile creatures] must be killed in order to protect these structures. In short, the game is based on violence,‚Äù
Furthermore, the report added that ‚Äúsome children may confuse the real world with the game world after playing Minecraft, leading to believe that torturing animals would not give them pain‚Äù.
Minecraft has not been banned in any countries so far, however there is precedent for games and movies to be banned in other countries. Minecraft just seems like an unlikely candidate.
As it stands, Minecraft is not yet banned, however the issue now lies with the courts, who will decide whether or not to officially ban it.

Letting out-of-state millionaires choose to reduce their income tax is, at the very least, unsustainable.
Governor Branstad's vetoes of ‚Äúone-time‚Äù funding pose ‚Äúongoing‚Äù and ‚Äúrecurring‚Äù problems for a major and ill-advised proposal by their allies to restructure personal income taxes in Iowa.
And they should.
During the last session, while lawmakers and the Governor were telling schools the state could not afford more than a 1.25 percent increase in per-pupil school aid, a group in the House was pushing a plan to let individuals choose a ‚Äúflat‚Äù income tax rate option. In other words, figure your taxes under the current rate structure, then compare it to the flat rate, and choose which one costs you less.
It benefits primarily the wealthy, and it costs big money. There is no upside.
We have seen such a proposal in the past, and we are virtually guaranteed to see it again in some form in 2016. Not only does it compound fairness issues in Iowa's tax structure, but it loses hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue, year after year, that Iowa legislators and the Governor have been telling us we cannot afford to lose.
Its supporters cannot avoid that contradiction, given their obsession this year about not letting a surplus ‚Äî and a sustained one at that ‚Äî be used for ‚Äúongoing‚Äù or ‚Äúrecurring‚Äù expenses on grounds they were not ‚Äúsustainable.‚Äù Those are the grounds for the Governor's vetoes of one-time funds for local schools, community colleges and state universities.
For good analysis of the 2015 alternative flat-tax proposal, which was not presented on the House floor as some of these messaging contradictions quickly became clear, see this Iowa Fiscal Partnership backgrounder by Peter Fisher. As Fisher noted, the projected revenue loss was projected at nearly half a billion dollars ‚Äî $482 million ‚Äî for the new fiscal year and around $400 million for each of the next three.
In short, the flat-tax idea is not ‚Äúsustainable.‚Äù No need to discuss in the 2016 session.

Those of you who read our teardowns know that we commonly are tearing down Canon or Nikon mount lenses. The reasons are pretty simple and it basically comes down to the fact that we have a lot more of those lenses. If we have a lot more it's less of a problem to take a couple out of stock for a teardown. Plus, we're more likely to be doing repairs on them in-house so we need to know the layout. Not to mention, since we spend most of our day inside those lenses, we know our way around them pretty well and don't look to stupid when we do a teardown.
But people who shoot Sony, or Pentax, or micro 4/3 ask us to rip apart their lenses, too. We've avoided doing that because of the above reasons and because we rarely try to repair them. But in the last few months, we've gotten motivated to look inside Sony E mount lenses. Partly it's because we're carrying a lot more of them. Partly it's because repair costs on Sony lenses have become ‚Äî well I like Sony, so let's just say ‚Äúfully valued.‚Äù
A few days ago, we sent a Sony 24-70 f/4 ZA OSS to repair because it made a grinding noise and wouldn't autofocus properly. That kind of thing happens all the time and the repair cost at most manufacturers is $200 to $300. When the service center told this would be an $800 repair, we decided to have them send it back and take a look inside ourselves.
‚ÄúSelf Portrait in a Vario-Tessar‚Äù. Lensrentals.com, 2015. Call for print prices.
One thing I like to mention before we start an article is what my expectations were on the front end. We know the 24-70 f/4, like most of the new Sony E mount lenses, has electromagnetic, rather than helicoid, autofocus. We also know that there's a bit more optical variability in these lenses (making me think optical adjustments are somewhat limited). So I rather expected we would find the internal optics/electromechanical parts of the lens might be completely sealed; not repairable, only replaceable. That would go along with high repair costs, too.
I also need to mention that we do NOT know how to repair Sony lenses. We don't have access to repair manuals, etc. This is not intended as a how-to-repair-your-lens article. We just thought you might enjoy watching us mess around with it and see what's inside of it. Oh, and the usual disclaimers ‚Äî if you do this yourself, it's on your nickel. Also, I can't respond to emails asking how to do this or that: you are many; I am one, and I really am supposed to be working much of the day.
By the way, if you feel the need to comment that we don't take beautifully lit product shots during a teardown, save it for someone who cares. We're tearing down a lens, trying to figure out how to fix it, and remembering how to put it all back together. We take a few hand-held shots while we do it, under the very harsh tungsten lighting we need to peer into the various nooks and crannies of the lens, so we can show it to you. If you want to look at beautiful pictures, go to Peter Lik's gallery or something.
So Let's Go Break Things!
The bayonet mount comes off in the usual fashion: remove the four screws. With Sony lenses it's usually simpler to disconnect the electrode flex from circuit board than to remove the electrodes from the bayonet.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
Sony doesn't hold their PCBs in with screws like most manufacturers, they use adhesive rubber bumpers. I don't have the slightest idea if it's an advantage or disadvantage, it's just different.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
With the PCB removed we get access to the four screws holding the rear barrel in place and can remove it.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
That exposes the zoom keys, one on either side, that have to be removed to let us take the zoom ring off.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
Since we weren't sure how the connections ran, we removed the screws holding the zoom position sensor before removing the zoom ring; part of the sensor was under the zoom ring.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
The zoom ring slides right off once the keys are removed and it's rotated to the right position.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
Now we can look at the working side of the zoom position sensor. It's a simple slide inserted into a rotating helicoid (red arrows). That's different than the electrical brushes and positions sensors that most lenses use, but certainly cleaner and simpler. I like it. Sure, the plastic tab could snap off, but the very thin metal brushes bend too, so I would think this is at least as reliable as a brush system.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
Moving right along, taking out another set of screws lets us remove the inner barrel.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
With the inner barrel removed we can see another nice touch that I wish all the other manufacturers would do. Sony places some cushioning strips between the extending barrel and the rest of the lens. This makes things move more smoothly and also prevents the plastic-on-plastic catches that sometimes develop with extending barrels.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
The front barrel is held on with three screws inserted into large brass inserts, just like most lenses use. Removing these lets us remove the extending barrel.
It's probably worth noting that with all the disassembly we've done, this is the first time we've removed any of the lens elements. The front element is removed with the extending barrel. Everything else we've removed has simply been structural or mechanical.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
What we're left with is the central core of the lens. This contains all of the glass (except the front element), the OSS unit, aperture, focusing motor, etc.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
We examined it pretty carefully, looking for optically adjustable elements. There were the usual helicoid sliding collars (red lines) and one set of elements that had what appeared to be eccentric adjustable collars on them (blue arrow), but closer examination showed those collars seemed to be holding the OS element so it's unlikely they have any optical adjusting capability.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
At any rate, removing the mount-side set of collars lets us remove the helicoid barrel.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
I should mention that these are thick, robust collars that look like they should hold up well.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
With those collars removed, the helicoid barrel slides right off.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
This barrel contains the second lens element, so now we have those two large elements removed and sitting in their barrels on the back bench.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
And what we are left working on is the small inner core of the lens, which contains all the other glass elements, the OS unit, autofocus unit, aperture assembly (you can see that on the top), etc. This is where I expected we'd find, like many micro 4/3 lenses, this entire unit would be sealed and could only be replaced, not repaired.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
But as very occasionally happens (very occasionally being defined as about 20 times a day), I was wrong less correct than I would like to have been. There were some nice obvious screws just waiting to be removed, letting us take the rear group off.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
With this group removed we can look directly down at the focusing element and the electromagnetic focusing mechanism. The focusing element is obvious. Rather than being moved by rotating through slanted helicoid tracks, it slides directly up and down on two metal posts (green lines), moved by the electromagnetic (red line), that receives power from a long, mobile flex cable (blue line). That's a very different system than most SLR lenses.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
Since this lens couldn't autofocus we took a look at the focus position sensor.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
Focus position is probably more critical than zoom position, and this seems to be an electro-magnetic type of sensor (I'm not 100% certain ‚Äì it might be some different kind of optical sensor), but at any rate, there were no obvious signs that anything was amiss with the sensor mechanism. (I know you're thinking, so if you don't even know what it is, how could you tell if something was wrong? Well, we could tell if it had a cracked flex, or broken solder, or stuff like that. But it could also be deader than dead and we wouldn't have a clue.)
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
Since this lens was broken we were a bit more aggressive with messing with stuff we didn't understand than we usually would be. We found out pretty quickly that the two metal rods the focusing element slides on could be removed.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
With the posts removed, we could pull the focusing assembly out of the barrel. You can see that the optical element just slides up and down within the eletromagnetic motor assembly.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
We didn't have a lot of hope that we'd be able to fix things in here since we haven't the slightest clue how it works. But once we started looking around we found an apparent problem. There was a dot of glue that apparently should attach the electromagnetic coil to the plastic housing of the focusing element, but the coil had become separated. You could see the imprints of coil in the glue, so it seemed pretty obvious they should be glued together.
Roger Cicala, Lensrentals.com, 2015
We figured we had nothing to lose, so we glued it back. (Do not try this at home unless you have a good ventilated hood or something similar. Glue fumes can totally eat the coating off of lens elements. Or can add a layer of white residue. Depends on what glue you pick.)
Much to our shock, the lens works perfectly fine after our homemade repair; at least it has so far. We'll keep it around here for a long while, though, to see if the glue we used fails since we don't know exactly what type of glue is originally used and how our choice (made on the scientific basis of ‚Äúwell, it kind of looks like this‚Äù) will hold up over time.
This concludes our little disassembly and triumphant random repair story, but you know me, I'll have a few random comments to make.
Roger's $0.02
My summary is that the 24-70 f/4 OSS Vario-Sonar is just what I've come to expect from Sony lately. Some amazingly great stuff, some rather apparently stupid stuff, and some stuff that I don't have enough knowledge to comment on.
The amazingly great stuff should be obvious. The lens is very cleanly designed and modular. We'd never been inside of one before, but had it completely disassembled in less than 45 minutes (it will take less than 30 minutes next time). The construction is robust for a small lens and there are several very nice touches, like the cushions under the extending barrel to keep the mechanism smooth.
The apparently stupid parts are pretty obvious, too. This lens seems beautifully designed for easy reparability, and I can think of no reason it's more expensive to repair than similar lenses from other brands. Charging such high prices is going to alienate customers pretty quickly. It's not too hard to get new customers, but it's almost impossible to regain a lost customer.
I would add that glue applied to smooth surfaces is unlikely to hold up forever on a frequently moving part where the force of movement is across the axis of the glue. A tiny notch or clamp from the plastic mount to the coil would have created a much more robust connection and not cost a dime if someone had simply designed it properly in the first place. So much of the lens is so thoughtfully engineered that it's a shame such a critical connection apparently was engineered as an afterthought.
It seems that there's not much optical adjustment capability in this lens. There are some shimable areas under the front group that we didn't show, and there may be some other adjustments we haven't recognized on a single disassembly (possible, not likely). In theory, you could make a lens so tightly toleranced that it doesn't need adjustment, or could test it at every step of assembly removing and replacing incompatible elements. But those two options are far too expensive for me to believe that they are actually being done, and anecdotal reports of significant copy-to-copy variation suggest they aren't. On the other hand, an f/4 lens doesn't need to be as critically adjusted as an f/1.4 or even an f/2.8 lens would.
I don't have a clue if electromagnetic focus is more or less accurate, reliable, durable, or expensive compared to the standard USM type AF seen in most SLR lenses. But from most of the comments and my own experience using the lenses, it certainly seems to work quite well.
After we've worked on some more of these lenses (and it seems likely we'll have to do that) we may get a better idea about some of these things. But this first glimpse was interesting.

Undercover IRS sting targets retired cop's role in North Side bar
IRS agents secretly recorded audio and video of a retired Chicago Police officer as they boasted about the bar they allegedly owned for 27 years. | AP file photo
When a pair of undercover IRS agents posed as potential buyers for a North Side bar last fall, they claim its longtime owner spilled the secret to their success.
Bottom line: They learned everything they needed to know about business working for the Chicago Police Department.
‚ÄúI was police for 32 years,‚Äù they allegedly told them. ‚ÄúI worked in a subterfuge unit and, in a subterfuge unit, I worked undercover and I worked in organized crime, so you saw how organized crime hid their ownership in certain businesses. So, I structured mine the same way. I structured and structuring it the same way, it's worked out.‚Äù
The agents secretly recorded audio and video of the retired officer as they boasted about the bar they allegedly owned for 27 years, according to court records obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times. They say they revealed differing handwritten ledgers for their cash-only business ‚Äî raising suspicions that they substantially underreported the bar's success.
But the man targeted in the undercover sting last September declined to comment on the details contained in the federal court records. The Sun-Times is not naming them because records show federal prosecutors have not filed any criminal charges against him. And, after agents used their recorded comments to obtain a search warrant for the bar last March, another document was filed indicating, ‚Äúthe warrant will not be executed.‚Äù
Meanwhile, general orders prohibit Chicago Police officers from owning a bar.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's office declined to comment, and a spokesperson for the IRS did not respond to messages.
Property tax bills for the bar are mailed to a business headed by the retired officer's wife, state and county records show. City Hall records list the retired officer as the bar's treasurer.
An IRS special agent explained in a search warrant application that the bar was listed for sale online last August for $439,000. An undercover IRS agent called the retired officer, claimed to be a potential buyer and set up a meeting in September to discuss a purchase, records show.
During that meeting, two undercover IRS agents posed as business partners and met with the former officer for roughly 90 minutes, records show. Not only did they allegedly boast during that meeting about learning how to structure their business from organized crime, they allegedly went into detail about their efforts to hide their role in the bar.
‚ÄúYou get all kind of jealous people beef,‚Äù they allegedly said. ‚ÄúI had 13 complaints to IAD that I owned a tavern. They investigated and I said, ‚ÄòWell, yeah, I own the tavern. I own the building. The tavern pays me rent and I own everything in the bar. I own the seats, the glassware . . . I own everything and that's why they pay me high rent. I can go in and out of there when I want because I make repairs.' ‚Äù
They allegedly told the agents that, ‚Äúevery time I walked in, I'd walk in with a toolbox because I didn't know if they were videotaping me from down the street.‚Äù
The agents claim the man showed them two handwritten notebooks ‚Äî a pink ‚Äúprivate‚Äù set of financial records, and a blue ‚Äúpublic‚Äù set. They allegedly told them the private notebook is ‚Äúmy own personal book. This is the one I take home. This isn't the one we use here at the business.‚Äù
They allegedly told them that the numbers they gave to their accountant ‚Äî an attorney who previously worked for the IRS ‚Äî differed from the numbers in their private notebook. And they allegedly said they would falsely record in the public notebook that the bar was closed on certain days, so they could use the income from those days to pay employees.
At one point, they allegedly pointed out the difference in January 2014 between their public notebook ‚Äî which recorded totals of $9,845 for the month ‚Äî and their private notebook ‚Äî which recorded totals of $29,282.
And while the bar allegedly reported just $115,855 in gross income to the IRS in 2014 ‚Äî for a loss of $7,700 ‚Äî the retired officer allegedly boasted that its gross income that year was really $338,144 ‚Äî with a net profit of $159,752.
Tim Harford ‚ÄúTrial, Error and the God Complex‚Äù
Harford discussed how companies rely far too much on finding geniuses (or ‚Äúmini-gods,‚Äù as they call them) who can solve their biggest problems. They say that instead, we need to utilize trial and error more often to solve problems and be okay with making mistakes as we learn. We don't always know the answers but we can find the solutions when we test out our different theories. They push to abandon the ‚Äúgod complex‚Äù and instead question and challenge ideas to find the best answers.
Stanley McChrystal ‚ÄúListen, Learn ‚Ä¶ Then Lead‚Äù
Once a general in the military, McChrystal discusses how important it is as a leader to listen to those who follow and depend on you. Their message to listen and learn first‚Äîand then lead‚Äîwill strengthen both leaders and their followers. They discuss the importance of relationships as the ‚Äúsinew that hold a force together.‚Äù They also say that ‚Äúa leader isn't good because they're right, they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust.‚Äù
Derek Sivers ‚ÄúHow to Start a Movement‚Äù
Sivers' talk on starting a movement and how important followers are for a single leader begins with a video of a solo dancer in the middle of a crowd; they then goes on to explain that without followers, a leader isn't much, but when followers begin to catch the vision of the leader and join them or her, more will follow. They encourage people who see others with great ideas to follow them early on and see how that greatness unfolds.
Sheryl Sandberg ‚ÄúWhy We Have Too Few Women Leaders‚Äù
Sheryl Sandberg's groundbreaking talk on women and leadership was eye-opening to many and was followed by an entire book on the issue. Sandberg discussed why there's a disparity in the numbers of male leaders vs. female and what we can do to help even the score. They emphasized the importance of helping women understand that they shouldn't pull back from their ambitions when getting ready to plan a family; instead, they should keep pushing for greatness.
Simon Sinek ‚ÄúHow Great Leaders Inspire Action‚Äù
Simon Sinek gave a talk that some would argue is one of the most inspiring Ted Talks ever given. Their speech not only encouraged leaders to take action but ultimately inspired organization-wide movements in those that heard this talk. Sinek's main argument was that if an organization doesn't know the why behind what it does, it won't be as successful. They then explained that people don't buy what you do, they buy why you do it, and that when you understand the why behind your ambition, you can do so much more.

The problem is, that in case of prism and pyramid we need height, so I used vector magnitude of V1=(Barnards Loop - Sinuefe) for it, but it is a very long shot. I also tried to tetrahedron and polygon net from it, but again, without knowing how to orientate 3rd point in relation to 2 we have (Barnard and synuefe), there is no way to find coordinates. It is very likely I am overlooking something since my astronomy skills are practically nonexistant, which might be a key to proper orientation of pyramid/tetrahedron.
After doing all of this, I have a strong belief that tetrahedron net might show us the coordinates for 3 other sites. Yes, 3 other, making it 4 total, just by the number of monolith or whatever you call them, pillars that hold ancient artifact, due to tetrahedron net having 4 outer angles (including top). Three triangle formations in ruins, while not aligned perfectly, might be an indication to that too. I also think that monolith at obelisk group A is indicating the planet we are on.
Anyhow, that is some food for thought. Not many results, but at least I learned some basic functions in geogebra... Hope some astronomy adept will figure out which way to rotate the triangle, and then we can pop this cherry.
NATO leaders will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Europe in May, Washington says.
The meeting was agreed to in a Sunday call between Trump and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, reports Reuters. The news agency cited a statement from the White House that said the two men ‚Äúdiscussed how to encourage all NATO allies to meet their defense spending commitments.‚Äù

TORONTO ‚Äî U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders urged Canadians on Sunday to snap out of their nice stereotypes and get noisy about demanding a national pharmacare program.
The former candidate for the Democratic Party presidential ticket spoke to a sold-out crowd at the University of Toronto's Convocation Hall that included students, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.

Mark Blinch/The Canadian Press NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh listens to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders at the University of Toronto on Oct. 29, 2017.
Sanders urged the crowd not to fixate on the shortcomings of Canadian health care and emphasized the lack of worry about medical debts if they get sick here.
"I know that Canadians are well-known throughout the world as gentle and kind people. Be a little bit louder," they said. "Stand up and fight for what you have achieved and defend it."
Sanders turned their ire on the pharmaceutical industry for continuing to "rip off the people of the United States, Canada, or any place else when they're making unbelievably excessive profits."
The independent senator spent a majority of their time lecturing the Canadian audience about the genesis of American health insurance and the current state of U.S. Medicare that has 28 million people without coverage.
Sanders blamed the GOP for threading "intentional lies and distortions" into the health-care debate. They referenced Sen. Rand Paul's argument from 2011 that compared the right to health care to slavery.
"These are very intentional lies in order to convince the American people that the dysfunctional system we have is the best that we can do," they said.

Steve Russell via Getty Images A sold-out crowd greeted U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in Toronto on Oct. 29, 2017.
The Toronto keynote comes a month after Sanders unveiled an enhanced version of their medicare program. The Medicare for All Act proposes the creation of a single-payer health system to replace almost all private health insurance.
It's been billed as one of, if not the most, ambitious social welfare initiative in U.S. history.
Wynne, who is vying for re-election in spring 2018, used their introduction to Sanders as an opportunity to plug their Ontario Liberal government's own socialist-inspired initiatives. They referenced programs to make prescription drugs free to everyone aged 24 and under, as well as a pledge to make tuition free to 210,000 students across Ontario.
That remark about free tuition earned some claps from Sanders, who tabled a similar bill in April for many students in the U.S.
Watch: Sanders throws a dig at Trump in front of Canadian crowd
Sanders is in Ontario for a two-day tour of hospitals with a delegation of American health-care providers to learn how the Canadian system works.
Dr. Danielle Martin, a Toronto-based family doctor who has been instrumental in the creation of Sanders' new medicare plan, told media after the event that Canada is overdue for a national pharmacare program.
"It's ridiculous that in the 21st century, our health-care system includes universal access to doctors and hospitals, but not to the prescription medicines like patients, my patients, need," they said.
Last month, the parliamentary budget officer released an analysis of the potential impact of a universal pharmacare program in Canada. It concluded that a national, universal program would reduce drug spending by $4.2 billion.
The report prompted NDP MP Don Davies to table a motion proposing to study and implement universal pharmacare. It was defeated in the House earlier this month by the Conservatives and Liberals in a 246 to 43 vote.
Liberals and Cons join to defeat #NDP Motion on national #pharmacare. We could help millions and save billions - but we'll have to wait. ‚Äî Don Davies, MP (@DonDavies) October 17, 2017
Despite all the cheers for Sanders and their socialist message, their speech wasn't the bromide one Toronto physician was hoping for.
Dr. Prabhat Jha, who is also a professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health, said they were "very impressed" with Sanders, but felt some nuances between the Canadian and American systems were missing.
"The U.S. debate, including from Senator Sanders, has been a little bit disingenuous because you can't have your cake and eat it too," Jha told HuffPost Canada.
"In Canada, we make a trade-off that we do have to wait in a queue, go through a GP to see a specialist." They said it's a reality "many Americans" don't want, adding if people want to see a cardiologist or another specialist, they're less likely to want to go through a middleman.
Jha said there's a difference between universal access to health coverage and universal coverage for all services, and that it's easy for audiences to conflate to the two in stump speeches.
"So a little more honesty about what those trade-offs are, I think would get more people on board."
Markets Insider
Bitcoin is closing in on record territory.
The cryptocurrency was trading up by 2.1% at $2,573 a coin as of 7:03 a.m. ET. The early advance has bitcoin on track for its best close ever. It would need to top $2,799 to put in its best print of all time.
Monday's advance comes absent any real catalyst. The bid seems to be a continuation of the gains that developed late last week after China's three biggest bitcoin exchanges announced they were allowing customers to begin withdrawals for the first time since February. At the time of the ban on withdrawals, bitcoin was threatening its then-record high of $1,161 a coin before plunging by more than 10% on the news.
Since then, however, bitcoin has seen a steady stream of good news. In early April, Japan announced bitcoin had become a legal payment method. Additionally, Russia's largest online retailer, Ulmart, began accepting bitcoin even though Russia said it wouldn't consider the use of the cryptocurrency until 2018.
There is still one big hurdle to climb. Back in March, the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected two bitcoin exchange-traded funds. It has since taken public comment on its decision regarding an ETF started by the Winklevoss twins, but it has not made an additional ruling.
Bitcoin is up 172% in 2017.
This week we have a medium-faithful episode I would say. Character-wise and plot-wise very much in step with the comic (almost everything in tonight's episode is covered in Volume 12: Life Among Them), with some stretching. The biggest difference is Rick's level of mistrust. In the comic they also don't trust Aaron but they overcome it without too much action. In the show Rick goes to much greater extremes (checking the cars, leaving at night, changing the route, etc). So let's check it out.
AARON CONTINUED
I didn't want to talk too much about Aaron's purpose last week, for people who haven't read the comic (who ARE you people?!). But this week we see that they are indeed recruiting for their walled community. Rick greets Aaron the same way in both the comic and the show:
Rick does this a few times in the comic. They love knocking new people out. You can also see that Michonne inherits Abe's post-punch line. I guess she's more Rick's right-hand man at this point.
In the comics Aaron also has a strong relationship with their partner, Eric. This hasn't changed, although Eric didn't break their ankle.
Also, it was Eric that had the listening device, not Aaron. And it wasn't a huge deal in the comic.
MICHONNE DISAGREES
Pretty similar between the two, Michonne is the voice of reason. They temper Rick's mistrust by pointing out that Aaron offers real hope.
THE ROAD TO ALEXANDRIA
As mentioned in the intro, this probably is the most different from the comic, but that doesn't mean a big scene wasn't pulled from the comic! In Volume 10: What We Fear, Rick, Carl, and Abraham are returning from Rick's hometown with Morgan when they encounter a herd and proceed to plow through it.
Look familiar? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I also think this is the first time Rick encounters a massive herd.
Although they just catch a glimpse of DC in the show, in the comic it's MUCH different. Guess you should read if you want to know‚Ä¶
I guess the brush with DC in the comic is kind of changed to the zombie pile-up and forest chase to the water tower in the show.
And last, we have our first glimpse of Alexandria:
A little more grandiose in the comic but the walls and gate are pretty similar. And I think in the show they want to keep what's on the other side of the wall a little more mysterious‚Ä¶
That's it for this week! What other biggies did we miss?!?!
PLEASE CHECK OUR RECAP AND DISCUSSION FOR THIS EPISODE:
Teddi Mellencamp claims that Matt Robertson was late for their blind date; Matt swears Teddi was early. Luckily, there is one fact about their set-up that the two can agree upon: it was a huge success. After becoming engaged sometime later in the glow of their candlelit Los Angeles apartment, Teddi and Matt also had no problem seeing eye-to-eye on where their family-focused wedding should be held. ‚ÄúFrom day one, we knew it would be at my dad's house in Indiana,‚Äù Teddi shares. And when ‚Äúdad‚Äù is singer John Mellencamp, the house is exactly the slice of Midwestern heaven you would imagine it to be ‚Äì and be thrilled to have access to.
With its sprawling grounds and lakeside view, the Mellencamp property was a dream setting for the elegant wedding Teddi and Matt envisioned. As director of public relations for the popular L.A. boutique Intuition, Teddi brought their hip sense of style to the planning process, which they shared with Matt, their families ‚Äì especially their mother Victoria Lynn Granucci ‚Äì Indiana coordinator Kelly Early, and Beverly Hills celebrity consultant Mindy Weiss. Pairing a traditional color palette of ivory and chocolate brown with contemporary floral arrangements and dark wood furniture, the group created a classic and chic look for the early summer wedding. Teddi's maid of honor, their sister Justice, and their eleven bridesmaids carried single white calla lilies against their pale blue dresses while Teddi held a fragrant bouquet of gardenias. Dressed in their Lazaro gown and ready ahead of schedule (‚ÄúAs usual,‚Äù laughs Teddi), the bride anxiously awaited a first look at their groom, which did not happen until they entered the outdoor ceremony on their father's arm. It was a thrill neither Teddi nor Matt would soon forget. ‚ÄúAlthough we had seen each other the night before, it felt like it had been days,‚Äù claims Teddi.
Glass bowls filled with all-white displays of gardenias, lilies, and orchids sat atop crisp, white reception tables surrounded by fruitwood chiavari chairs. Although guests plucked their place cards from a wrought iron fence strewn with ribbons, everyone was free to sit wherever they wanted, taking it upon themselves to fill the tables without the help of a seating chart. The 290 guests also helped create the evening's easy and affectionate atmosphere as they dined on California-inspired cuisine and toasted the couple with laughter and heartfelt words. ‚ÄúAlthough we had a large wedding,‚Äù remembers Teddi, ‚ÄúIt seemed very intimate and warm.‚Äù But the group did not stay seated for long. ‚ÄúWe were under the assumption that a DJ would handle most of the music and were surprised when my dad and their band played an entire set,‚Äù recalls Teddi.
Word traveled quickly of Mellencamp's performance, and soon about fifteen boats filled with local fans appeared on the lake. The more the merrier, according to the couple. ‚ÄúIt was such an amazing surprise for us and for all of our friends who had traveled so far to celebrate with us.‚Äù Some of the guests even took their turn on stage, performing along with the band. And while the day went by faster than they ever expected, the newlyweds took several opportunities to stop and really appreciate the amazing experience unfolding around them. ‚ÄúWe were grateful to have been given this advice beforehand,‚Äù says Teddi, recommending that other couples take time during their own weddings to sit back and drink in the scenery.

Eric ‚Äúreinnnn‚Äù Khor I love pudding. I love Dota too. But pudding usually wins.
China is celebrating. It's showing off military hardware. Chinese markets are closed. Finally, folks around the world can focus for a few days on things other than China's slowing economy and strong-arm methods to stops stocks from plunging further.
But there's something happening in Hong Kong with a sense of foreboding for China and other places around the world: As stocks swooned, home sales in August plunged.
Hong Kong's stocks got swept up by the China stock market bubble. In May 2014, the Hang Seng was at 22,000, made its way to 24,000 by March 2015, then soared 18% in six weeks, to 28,442 by April 28. Participants were getting richer by the minute. But then it dropped and now sits at 20,934, down 26% from its April peak, down 12% in August alone, and back where it had been for the first time in May 2007.
Mainland Chinese stocks fared worse, with the Shanghai Composite crashing 39%. Wealth has evaporated into the ether at a stunning speed, and all the fun has been leeched out of it. But it's not just a game.
There are consequences. For example, the Mandatory Provident Fund that covers 2.5 million workers lost 5.6% in August alone, according to the South China Morning Post . And it also hit the housing market.
In August, home sales in Hong Kong plunged 27.8% from a year ago, to 3,896 units, according to the Land Registry. Total sales value dropped 30.3% to HK$31 billion ($4 billion).
But developers that cut prices and offered big incentives were able to unload their units.
Sun Hung Kai Properties, one of Hong Kong's largest property groups, offered discounts of 11% for the apartments at phase two of its Century Link development in Tung Chung, according to the South China Morning Post . It also threw in a special incentive for investors: a cash rebate equivalent to 30 mortgage payments, but only on second mortgages, hence only for investors. To help investors overcome the banks' mortgage ceiling of 60%, SHKP offered them an additional loan of 15% of the purchase price.
It was a sweet deal.
The pre-sale started at 9 a.m. on Thursday. Over 6,100 potential buyers had registered. By 6:20 p.m. the same day, it had sold all 328 units, ‚Äúaccording to market sources.‚Äù Investors bought 40% of the units.
They weren't exactly palaces, ranging in size from 378 to 645 sq. ft. But they weren't cheap either, ranging in price, discounts included, from HK$3.82 million ($490,000) to HK$7.65 million (nearly $1 million).
Other sellers weren't so lucky.
Far East Consortium International was able to offload only 58% of the 234 units at its Aspen Crest project in Diamond Hill when they went on sale last weekend.
‚ÄúThe investment sentiment wasn't good in the past month,‚Äù Alvin Lam, a director at Midland Holdings, a real estate broker traded on the Hang Seng, told Bloomberg . ‚ÄúYou can tell from the city's falling retail rents, consumption, and retail sales.‚Äù
He'd helped the government organize an auction of 10 apartments. The auction took place on August 24, the day after Chinese stocks had their worst plunge since 2007, and only four apartments were sold.
‚ÄúPeople have been much more cautious because the adjustment was huge this time,‚Äù they told Bloomberg. ‚ÄúThis is a widespread change. The adjustment happened not only in Hong Kong or Greater China, but also in the US and other areas.‚Äù
But before Hong Kong? An 18-month plunge from hell. Read‚Ä¶ Macau's Economy Blows Up

Game programmers deal with homogeneous coordinates on a regular basis . They are a neat extension of standard three dimensional vectors and allow us to simplify various transforms. But do you really know, what they mean?
Usually gamedevs describe homogeneous coordinates like this: ‚ÄúYou add a fourth coordinate to your Vec3 and call it w. Oh, and w is usually set to 1. Now you can do a rotation and translation using a single matrix*vector operation. Cool, isn't it? 8) And when you do a projection, then the result will have w != 1. To get the projected point you have to divide by w so that in (x/w, y/w, z/w, 1) w equals 1 again. That's called normalization!‚Äù Sometimes they might even add: ‚ÄúIf w equals 0 then (x, y, z, 0) is called a ‚Äòvector' and if w equals 1 then it is called a ‚Äòpoint'. Vectors are directions and won't be affected by translations and points will.
Since my background is mathematics and not computer science, these explanations always made me cringe a little. Because they are kind of true and to be honest they are probably all you'll ever need as a game programmer. If that's fine with you then you can stop reading now. But if you want a bit more background information, then please continue.
You are still reading? Good. Homogeneous coordinates were introduced in linear algebra to describe projective spaces. Here's what Mathworld has to say about projective spaces. If you are now thinking ‚ÄúWTF?!‚Äù then I agree. Mathematicians tend to describe simple things in a way so that no one but them can understand it (similar to lawyers and doctors.)
Let me translate this into English. To further simplify it, I will explain the concept using a 2D plane. This allows me to draw some diagrams to illustrate a projective plane . Homogeneous coordinates add another dimension, namely the w-coordinate. Since my 4D drawing skills are not that great it's just easier to look at homogeneous coordinates for a 2D plane.
Step 1: Why was projective geometry invented? Answer: mathematicians do not like exceptions from rules. They literally despise them. In a plane the following statement is true: ‚ÄúTwo distinct lines intersect at exactly one point, except when they are parallel.‚Äù Your average mathematician will now be running round ‚ÄúOh, those damned parallel lines. I wish they wouldn't exist!!‚Äù
Step 2: But one day a mathematician had an idea: ‚ÄúWait a second, what if we can generalize Euclidean geometry? Let's embed the 2D plane in 3D space. We'll do this by calling all lines passing through origin (0,0,0) ‚Äòpoints' and then we'll call all planes passing through origin ‚Äòlines'‚Äù So basically what they suggested was to increase the dimension of primitives by one dimension. Points -> lines, lines -> planes. The whole 3D space is called the projective plane.
Step 3: If you think: ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù then don't worry. It will all become clearer soon. (Oh and I am pointing the z axis down, so that the pictures later on will be easier to draw.)
Just consider this: every line through the origin can be written as k*(x,y,z) where (x,y,z) != (0,0,0). This also means that e.g. k*(1,2,3) represents the same line as k*(5,10,15) because (1,2,3) and (5,10,15) are collinear (which is math speech for being on the same line)
Step 4: Now let's intersect some ‚Äúpoints‚Äù (ie. green lines) and a ‚Äúline‚Äù (ie. a red plane) with the plane z=1 (blue in this diagram)
As you can see, the green lines through the origin intersect the plane in points. The red plane intersects the plane in a line. The plane z=1 is called an affine view of the projective plane.
Step 5: So why did we do all this? Look at the ‚Äúpoints‚Äù (ie. green lines) we talked about. All ‚Äúpoints‚Äù which are lines of the form k*(x,y,z) where z is not zero will intersect our affine view, the z=1 plane.
k*(x,y,z) are called the homogeneous coordinates (aha!) of a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù on a projective ‚Äúplane‚Äù (which is actually the whole 3D space). For example if k*(12,8,4) are the coordinates for one ‚Äúpoint‚Äù then (12,8,4) is one representative and (3,2,1) is its normalized form.
Now let's remove the coordinate axes from the drawing. Then all that's left is our affine view which looks just like a bog standard 2D plane with green points (which are actual points) and a red line (which is a real line).
Step 6: So what about points where z=0? Points with coordinates k*(x,y,0) are called ‚Äúvanishing points‚Äù (or points at infinity) and they do not intersect the plane z=1.
What's so nice about them? Let's revisit intersections of lines and our panicking mathematicians. If you take two projective ‚Äúlines‚Äù (which are planes through the origin) then they will always(!) intersect in a line through origin which as we now know is a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù. If the ‚Äúlines‚Äù are not parallel (ie. the intersection of their planes with z=1 are not parallel) then the resulting ‚Äúpoint‚Äù will also intersect the plane z=1. If that sounds confusing then I hope this picture will clear things up.
If the ‚Äúlines‚Äù are parallel this means that they will intersect in a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù=line that is parallel to z=1, so it'll be a ‚Äúvanishing point‚Äù. E.g. these two red planes (=‚Äùlines‚Äù) intersect in k*(1,0,0) which is the x-axis.
All ‚Äúvanishing points‚Äù together form a line: the plane z=0 which is called the ‚Äúvanishing line‚Äù.
Step 7: Conclusion: In a projective plane we can finally say that ‚Äúall lines intersect in exactly one point‚Äù. For mathematicians that's super nice, it makes them sleep better.
Step 8: Why are lines parallel to z=1 called ‚Äúvanishing points‚Äù? Remember that z=1 is just one affine view of our projective plane. We could take any other plane (not going through the origin) and intersect it with our ‚Äúpoints‚Äù and ‚Äúlines‚Äù to get another affine view. For example if you tilt the plane z=1 a bit so that it intersects the x-axis then you would be able to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the vanishing point which is the intersection of the two parallel lines in the picture above.
You can see this effect everyday. Look at train tracks. They are parallel, but when you look at them vanishing into the distance they seem to intersect in an inifinitely distant point. So projective geometry is actually the study of euclidean geometry when it is being projected.
Step 9: Another way of visualizing a projective plane would be imagining a sphere centered around the origin. Then all ‚Äúlines‚Äù would result in circles and ‚Äúpoints‚Äù in a pair of matching dots on the sphere. The advantage of this method is that there wouldn't be be any difference between normal and vanishing points. But this model is less intuitive than the affine view.
Step 10: Summary: Homogeneous 3D coordinates (which are 4D) are just a generalization of the things I've explained above. Coordinates are extended with a fourth coordinate w. Two vectors (x,y,z,w) and (x',y',z',w') represent the same point in 3D space if one is a multiple of the other. (x,y,z,1) is called the normalized form. Points of the form (x,y,z,0) are again called ‚Äúvanishing points‚Äù.
The distinction point vs vector is something that I've only heard in the context of computer science. But I admit that it does make sense to say that (x,y,z,0) are ‚Äúdirections‚Äù and (x,y,z,1) are ‚Äúpoints‚Äù. When you think back at our projective plane then every ‚Äúline‚Äù (which is a plane through origin) can be described by a point p=(x,y,1) and a point d=(dx,dy,0). Those two vectors certainly won't be collinear and therefore always span a ‚Äúline‚Äù (=plane). s*p will be a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù that intersects z=1, and t*d is a vanishing point that can be interpreted as the direction of the line which is exactly how we define normal affine lines: p+k*d.
Projective geometry lets you write affine transforms using a single matrix operation (but you already knew that). It also let's you write projections using a matrix operation. The simplest being (x,y,z,1) -> (x,y,z,z) . After renormalization we get (x/z,y/z,1,1). But keep in mind: In projective space (x/z,y/z,1,1) and (x,y,z,z) represent the same point.
The same analogy for affine views applies for a 3D space. Basically our world is only one single 3D affine view of a 3D projective space embedded in 4D! Try that next time to impress people with CSI techno babble!
(For the interested: What mathematicians also like about projective planes is that they fulfill the principle of duality. Simplified this means that any theorem about points and lines can be converted into a ‚Äúdual‚Äù theorem by exchanging the words line and point and change ‚Äúintersect‚Äù to ‚Äúcontained on‚Äù. The simplest would be ‚ÄúFor two distinct points there is always a line that contains them.‚Äù The dual statement is ‚ÄúTwo distinct lines always intersect in one point‚Äù. Obviously this is not true for affine lines because of parallel lines, but for a projective plane this statement is true. And it can be proven that for all statements that are true in a projective plane, the dual statement is also true. Why is this important? Because if a theorem is difficult to prove then maybe its dual counterpart is easier to prove which would then result in proving the dual version as well.)
Ok, that's it. I hope I could demystify homogeneous coordinates and didn't confuse you even more. It won't change the way you'll use them in your 3D engine, but maybe you'll look at them in a different way now. Homogeneous coordinates are used in the field of projective geometry which generalizes affine geometry.
By the way: quaternions also haven't been invented to let game developers do nice rotations. But that's a different story ‚Ä¶
Update (28th Jan 2013): The term ‚Äúnormalized‚Äù can be confusing when it comes to homogeneous coordinates. To clear this up: When we deal with homogeneous coordinates (x, y, z, w), then the normalized form means w==1. When talking about ordinary 3d coordinates, then normalized means length==1. In the above article whenever I use the term normalized, I mean normalized in the sense of normalized homogeneous coordinates, NOT unit length.
